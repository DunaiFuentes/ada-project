You'll need to do first:
CBT - Allows up to 125cc

After that:

Either - Theory test + A1 Test - Allows you to take off the ""L"" plates. It just means if you never intend to ride above 125cc you don't need to renew your CBT every few years.

Or - Theory Test Plus straight on to A2 - Allows up to 47HP (Or any bike limited down to that so long as the original HP isn't more than 94HP) - Doing this actually saves money off of doing A1 then A2 THEN full A.

From there you need to wait a minimum of 2 years before you can attempt the full A (Unrestricted HP license), which gives you access to the fun stuff.

If you're 24 or above you can do a DAS (Direct access scheme) which means you can do CBT -&gt; Theory Test and then straight on to full A.

This depends. In terms of hype definitely, in terms of ability too but in terms of what they add to the squad I think other players would do more. Think about it. Ronaldo plays in a position which the team has filled with one of the best players in the world already who is younger and while not better, will be playing at a top level for a lot longer. Messi is incredible but wouldn't fit into the Chelsea system at all as it stands (he only plays centrally for Barca but Chelsea would struggle with a less direct centre forward I think) and again would go into a position which already has a world class player in it who's scoring a lot of goals. 

No players in the world may be quite as good as Messi or Ronaldo but Chelsea could arguably benefit a lot more by filling the weaker positions in the team rather than ones already incredibly strong. For instance I think Bale would offer more than either for a couple of reasons like being a prolifically talented right winger, homegrown and younger. Same could be said of someone like Pogba in midfield. Buying the biggest name player on the market and hoping they'd fit isn't a great way to acquire talent and can potentially end up in expensive flops like Shevchenko.",null,0,null,1420443025,null,0,false,0,cnexeyv,null,t3_2rd4hy,null,t1_cnexeyv,null,t1_cnetsay,null,null,null,1425051401,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

Although there are episodes which are looked down on and aren't rated as highly as others, I feel every episode is pretty special. Might just be me living in Australia, but there's nothing else really like it on TV. 

Saying that, my girlfriend started watching sporadically towards the end of David Tennant's run, and started watching consistently when Matt Smith entered. Although she missed an entire season and the odd episode in between, she still loved it and has been hooked since.

Can't recommend it highly enough.

I understand many criticisms of him, but to say he is slow in possession is just wrong. The majority of his passing is first time.

It is true that he often plays simple passes, but he does so quickly and as many MANY people here have pointed out this is exactly what we need sometimes (hence constant criticism of Dembele for lingering on the ball). If you fail to see how important recycling possession is in football you probably haven't watched that much.

Sure, he isn't great defensively and he will never be big, but that can be worked on. It's quite rare that you get youth players who are so hungry for the ball, but get it and do the right things rather than be flashy. If you didn't watch it, watch his performance against Basel. He was constantly available for a pass, and never dwelt on one. As soon as he gave the ball he was instantly making space to receive the next. He made Dembele look like the youth player that game.

Despite all that BS with Yaya this summer, it would've been extremely shortsighted to sell him. This isn't Fifa or FM. It's not a factory. If, IF, we lose some money on not selling a player at their ""peak"" selling time, so what. I think we can afford that loss. Plus, Yaya's a big part of the team, as evidenced by when he's on or off, the team result usually follows accordingly. 

We'll be able to get a few players every year, depending on who we loan or sell. Although quite a lot of players are similar age, they all won't last the same amount of time (KNOCK ON WOOD). So it won't be like one year we'll lose 8 players to age/decline. 

The real problem I see is that we will have to find some top top quality players at some point. Our team is really stacked right now, and it wouldn't be hard to argue we should be getting more out of them than we sometimes do. As seen yesterday, even against a lower league side, who we smashed 7-0 earlier this season, we were stumped without a few of our most important players. 

Down the road, we will have to buy some big replacements. Hopefully these won't have to be all for one season. Plus, depending on the manager, we can possibly find some bargains like we did with Demichelis. Yeah he had problems his first year in the league, but it wasn't for the whole year, and we won the league. He was one of our starting CBs. Value transfers are out there! 

As for the youth, I honestly don't have great faith that loads of them will get significant PT, given what we're trying to do. We DO have a full senior team, each member of which is capable of being a regular starter on many other teams. The academy supports the senior team, not the other way. Plus, it's obvious that not every academy player is going to move up to the senior club. They get great training and play for a great club. They know that. They can go to other clubs and have great careers too. And, I think we're genuinely trying to win every comp we're in (though some more than others, if that makes sense). We're expected to win every comp we're in (save UCL), or at least go to the finals. The thing is, rarely do we need youth to come up. If some do leave, the first team won't crumble. And there will definitely be other youth squaders to replace those that do leave.

TL;DR: I ain't got no worries. We have money to buy what we need, and we won't be buying a big group of top quality players all at once. Plus, rules change. FFP will change, and we'll adjust.

However, your conflation of a single unknown desktop issue, with the end result of Linux never having that problem, betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of IT. Your anecdote really doesn't give us enough information and it's far too much of a leap to say ""Wouldn't have happened on Linux, switch to Linux"".

&gt;If they were running Linux that would have NEVER been the solution.

Impossible to say. There could be so many reasons for that sticker it's insane:

- The desktop technician for the site is lazy, and doesn't want to look into the issue but knows a restart will fix it. 

- It might be that funds can't be secured for a replacement desktop/NIC until the desktop has fully lost networking capability.

- The server/switch they're using to handle DHCP is faulty, and is dropping that desktop's DHCP lease. A restart is a quick-and-dirty fix.

Are a few. We don't know the budget for the site; if the hardware itself is starting to fail, then a workstation with a linux distro won't be in any better shape then one running Windows. We don't know the capabilities of the local IT team, of the networking infrastructure, the back-end etc.

However she can still be held to account - just not in a conventional way - it would have to be a revolution - and this fact should weigh heavily on any monarch.

Personally though, I am happy - because the laws I live under today work for me, so there's no harm in those laws staying.

If the government try to introduce a new law tomorrow, either it's going to be better for me, or worse:

If there is no Queen veto:

* The government introduces a new law, and it's better for me - my circumstances improve.
* The government introduces a new law, and it's worse for me - my circumstances worsen.

* Limitations on number of properties held by a landlord. (At least, this might cause an explosion in the number of landlords and would not directly address the problem). For avoidance of doubt, I think the primary problem is extremely low risk profit makes buying properties an excellent investment vehicle for those with suitable savings/credit rating.

* Some kind of right to buy for tenants, but tied to the lifetime of a rented property, not on a particular lease. The goal would be to preserve a landlord's ability to profit from their property (in return for assuming the credit risk of purchasing the property in the absence of guaranteed future rents), but capped somehow in relation to the total value of the property, and providing some mechanism for tenants to recuperate some of the cash they paid into the landlord's mortgage.

I've thought a lot recently about the last idea, and no clue how it would work. Granting an option to buy according to the length of a lease can easily be subverted, by landlords evicting tenants as that time approaches. Granting an option to buy according to total time the property has been rented prevents this, but I have no idea how a privilege like this would be structured, an individual tenant has made much less of a contribution to paying for the property

Whatever the solution, I think it needs to a) remain profitable for landlords and b) somehow cap the landlord's earnings regardless of the rent they charge.",null,0,null,1420449002,null,0,1420449320,0,cneyxza,null,t3_2rc3r0,null,t1_cneyxza,null,t3_2rc3r0,null,null,null,1425050687,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

The economy is more or less most efficient when there is a degree of unemployment. Not a huge one but not 0 either (5% is the number I've heard quoted). A bigger problem is while your hardcore Thatcherites will move heaven and earth to keep unemployment above that level they'll also assault welfare. When your core economic argument precludes full employment the institution of welfare becomes a moral imperative.

&gt; Deficit

The only way to fix the deficit is to grow the economy. That is what we've seen the past three years as the Tories have gone from austerity towards stimulus in order to fight their election campaign. The hilarious thing is their election stimulus actually cut the deficit by more than their austerity.

You're talking about the MESSAGE of whatever posters. That's fine, and if politicians lied or misled then they should be called out. 

However, this is a fuss about the stock photograph originating from Germany and not the UK. It's not about the message or anything of substance. It's just cheap point scoring.

Secondly, UK unemployment is super low right now. More people in full time work than before, and some of the best figures in Europe. If you attribute a rise in unemployment to the Tories after they were in power for a year, you just attribute this massive reduction to them too. So I'd say the Tories have done an ok job with that.

As for the NHS, for the duration of this evil government it has been constantly recognised as excellent, as well as extremely efficient. So again, it seems the Tories haven't quite dismantled things and fucked up the NHS in the way you think.

***
&gt;  I never dreamed slowly cruising on my motorcycle through a residential neighborhood could be so incredibly dangerous! Little did I suspect.

&gt; I was on Brice Street - a very nice neighborhood with perfect lawns and slow traffic. As I passed an oncoming car, a brown furry missile shot out from under it and tumbled to a stop immediately in front of me.

&gt; It was a squirrel, and must have been trying to run across the road when it encountered the car. I really was not going very fast, but there was no time to brake or avoid it -- it was that close. I hate to run over animals, and I really hate it on a motorcycle, but a squirrel should pose no danger to me.

&gt; I barely had time to brace for the impact. Animal lovers, never fear.

&gt; Squirrels, I discovered, can take care of themselves!

&gt; Inches before impact, the squirrel flipped to his feet. He was standing on his hind legs and facing my oncoming Harley Davidson with steadfast resolve in his beady little eyes.

&gt; His mouth opened, and at the last possible second, he screamed and leapt! I am pretty sure the scream was squirrel for, ""Bonzai!"" or maybe, ""Die you gravy-sucking, heathen scum!"" The leap was nothing short of spectacular...

&gt; He shot straight up, flew over my windshield, and impacted me squarely in the chest. Instantly, he set upon me. If I did not know better, I would have sworn he brought 20 of his little buddies along for the attack.

&gt; Snarling, hissing, and tearing at my clothes, he was a frenzy of activity. As I was dressed only in a light T-shirt, summer riding gloves, and jeans this was a bit of a cause for concern. This furry little tornado was doing some damage!

&gt; Picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and leather gloves, puttering at maybe 25 mph down a quiet residential street, and in the fight of his life with a squirrel.

&gt; And losing...

&gt; I grabbed for him with my left hand. After a few misses, I finally managed to snag his tail. With all my strength, I flung the evil rodent off to the left of the bike, almost running into the right curb as I recoiled from the throw. That should have done it. The matter should have ended right there.

&gt; It really should have. The squirrel could have sailed into one of the pristinely kept yards and gone on about his business, and I could have headed home. No one would have been the wiser. But this was no ordinary squirrel. This was not even an ordinary angry squirrel.

&gt; This was an EVIL MUTANT ATTACK SQUIRREL OF DEATH!

&gt; Somehow he caught my gloved finger with one of his little hands and, with the force of the throw, swung around and with a resounding thump and an amazing impact, he landed squarely on my BACK and resumed his rather antisocial and extremely distracting activities. He also managed to take my left glove with him! The situation was not improved. Not improved at all.

&gt; His attacks were continuing, and now I could not reach him. I was startled, to say the least. The combination of the force of the throw, only having one hand (the throttle hand) on the handlebars, and my jerking back unfortunately put a healthy twist through my right hand and into the throttle. A healthy twist on the throttle of a Harley can only have one result.

&gt; Torque.

&gt; This is what the Harley is made for, and she is very, very good at it.

&gt; The engine roared and the front wheel left the pavement. The squirrel screamed in anger. The Harley screamed in ecstasy. I screamed in ...well ... I just plain screamed

&gt; Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a slightly squirrel-torn t-shirt, wearing only one leather glove, and roaring at maybe 50 mph and rapidly accelerating down a quiet residential street on one wheel, with a demonic squirrel of death on his back.

&gt; The man and the squirrel are both screaming bloody murder. With the sudden acceleration I was forced to put my other hand back on the handlebars and try to get control of the bike.

&gt; This was leaving the mutant squirrel to his own devices, but I really did not want to crash into somebody's tree, house, or parked car. Also, I had not yet figured out how to release the throttle...my brain was just simply overloaded. I did manage to mash the back brake, but it had little effect against the massive power of the big cruiser.

&gt; About this time the squirrel decided that I was not paying sufficient attention to this very serious battle (maybe he was an evil mutant NAZI attack squirrel of death), and he came around my neck and got INSIDE my full-face helmet with me.

&gt; As the faceplate closed part way, he began hissing in my face. I am quite sure my screaming changed intensity. It had little effect on the squirrel, however. The RPMs on the engine maxed out (since I was not bothering with shifting at the moment), so her front end started to drop.

&gt; Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a very raggedly torn T-shirt, wearing only one leather glove, roaring at probably 80 mph, still on one wheel, with a large puffy squirrel's tail sticking out of the mostly closed full-face helmet. By now the screams are probably getting a little hoarse.

&gt; Finally I got the upper hand ... I managed to grab his tail again, pulled him out of my helmet, and slung him to the left as hard as I could. This time it worked ... sort-of.

&gt; Spectacularly sort-of ...so to speak.

&gt; Picture a new scene. You are a cop. You and your partner have pulled off on a quiet residential street and parked with your windows down to do some paperwork. Suddenly a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a torn T-shirt flapping in the breeze, and wearing only one leather glove, moving at probably 80 mph on one wheel, and screaming bloody murder roars by, and with all his strength throws a live squirrel grenade directly into your police car.

&gt; I heard screams.

&gt; They weren't mine...

&gt; I managed to get the big motorcycle under control and dropped the front wheel to the ground. I then used maximum braking and skidded to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke at the stop sign of a busy cross street. I would have returned to 'fess up (and to get my glove back). I really would have.

&gt; Really... Except for two things.

&gt; First, the cops did not seem interested or the slightest bit concerned about me at the moment. When I looked back, the doors on both sides of the patrol car were flung wide open. The cop from the passenger side was on his back, doing a crab walk into somebody's front yard, quickly moving away from the car. The cop who had been in the driver's seat was standing in the street, aiming a riot shotgun at his own police car.

&gt; So, the cops were not interested in me. They often insist to ""let the professionals handle it"" anyway.

&gt; That was one thing. The other?

&gt; Well, I could clearly see shredded and flying pieces of foam and upholstery from the back seat. But I could also swear I saw the squirrel in the back window, shaking his little fist at me. That is one dangerous squirrel. And now he has a patrol car. A somewhat shredded patrol car ... but it was all his.

&gt; I took a deep breath, turned on my turn-signal, made a gentle right turn off of Brice Street, and sedately left the neighborhood. I decided it was best to just buy myself a new pair of gloves.

I don't know why Borini is still at the club. I like the lad, but Rodgers clearly thinks he's not good enough for the team we want Liverpool to be. He seemed to enjoy his time at Sunderland, and he should have signed for them in the summer. Currently, circumstances have to be dire for Rodgers to use him, and when he gets his chance absolutely nothing goes his way. We won't get as much money for him as we were offered in the summer, but we should try again to move him on this window.

If we do OK in the 3 cup competitions we might be playing 2 matches a week for the remainder of the season and 3 at the pointy end.

Since the Glorious revolution in 1688, parliament has had supremacy over the monarchies. If the monarch only holds a ceremonial position, how can they be responsible for years of stability? There are a number of factors that you've failed to take into account, the UK has come very close to revolution many times in history; take the civil war and magna cater for instance. Possibly the biggest factor is our standing on the world stage, we we're number one for over 100 years, many disgruntled citizens (or subjects) we're able to move to the colonies.

Besides, to me this point is irrelevant. Just because we've had less revolutions than other states on the continent, doesn't mean we shouldn't be looking forward and continue to improve our system of government; the constitutional parliamentary system we currently have is inherently flawed and outdated.

I don't want to sound like I'm attacking the family on a personal level (even thought there are plenty of scumbags within it), however there are plenty of good reasons to disband the crown and improve the system.

Seriously what on earth is he thinking trying to outmuscle a guy in the box when he is the wrong side of him?

In the premiership the forward player probably would have gone to ground and most likely been given a penalty, you just can't make that kind of tackle in the box.

When the ball comes out, Mikel should conceed possession i.e. let the other guy get there first, but use that time to take a step towards goal to block any attempt of a low pass or the guy running into our box.

He was never getting there first, he was the wrong side, defending is about defending as a team not just 1v1.

IF he lets the guy run in front of him, and takes 2 paces towards our goal, he blocks any attempt of a low cross aka job done.

If the forward pings the ball into the box in the air then he gives our defence a chance to clear the ball.

What he ends up doing is giving them possession, getting wrong side of his player and nearly causing us to concede a goal.

All of this based on the fact he didnt properly stop the through ball in the first place, secondly he didn't then track his man (he should have already been goalside).

I don't understand how Mourinho can not see this time after time after time with Mikel.

Oh, good save btw.

We have only one example of this under the crown.  [And a glorious example it makes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/01/australia-had-a-government-shutdown-once-it-ended-with-the-queen-firing-everyone-in-parliament/).

In our scenario of the child screaming on the supermarket floor, the crown serves as the parent the US govt lacks.

It's not the best system.  I'm not sure anyone's found the 'best' system yet.

I have done locum work before, but not full-time.  I have a full-time post with my NHS trust and do ""internal"" locum work to fill in unexpected rota gaps.

I do know several doctors (A&amp;E and GP) who are full-time locums.  I also know one radiologist (my field).

There are several pros and cons.  Some people like to be rooted in one place, to get to know their department, colleagues, patients.  Also, there's much less paperwork.

However, it's much more lucrative.  I can be paid up to 50 per hour before tax for an ""internal"" locum shift (did a 48 hour locum shift recently).  For an ""external"" shift the billed rates are higher.  For a consultant, both rates are considerably higher still (we had to pay a consultant radiologist nearly 6k for 48 hours at a nearby trust at short notice).  My GP locum friends make in 3 days working per week what I do in 5 days working.  There's a lot of money to be made, particularly if you do maternity locums.

An advantage of locum work is the relative lack of responsibility to your department.  You can turn up, do the work, and go home.  No overarching politics etc.

Now to respond to the quite obvious early 2000's Slashdot-esque Linux Zealot, as a Unix guy for the last, errr well since 1989 I think I'm qualified to correct this:

So you're saying that would never have been the solution on Linux?You've never dealt with the total shit crock that is Linux WiFi and wpa_supplicant then? Then NetworkManager, now systemd. There is so much non-deterministic behaviour in the network stack it's unreal. I run a number of production Linux machines (44 to be precise) and it's painful.

Regarding Microsoft's success, this is down to three things which apply significantly in the case of the NHS:

a) Unix was immature in the 1990s for desktop usage. Really immature. There was nothing past Motif/CDE really until the very late 1990s. Microsoft was already pushing mature GUI toolkits and desktop operating systems with scary good automation (win32, office, COM,). People built stuff on it because it was a better foundation than having to reinvent the wheel. Good show.

b)  Cost. Windows was cheaper than Unix. To give you an idea, I paid in 1997, £9200 for a Sun Ultra workstation. A similar spec PC was around the £1250 mark. Yes that much. Linux didn't work on anything back then other than a subset of x86 hardware and not reliably by any means. We didn't get any form of industrial reliability with Linux until around 2002 and even today there are some rotten great big hand grenades in it.

c) Momentum. Everything is programmed against win32 so it makes sense to keep it there. The reengineering requirements are extensive. Not only that, there are very few logically consistent APIs in Unix/Linux that have lasted as long as the windows API. As I said in another post, stuff I wrote in 1988 will still compile and run on Windows 8.1 with VS2013 today.

So what you're suggesting is that we pay for the migration of all of the software, entirely new desktop software to be written from scratch, a stable fork of a Linux distribution to be made, to provide API guarantees that last 20 years like windows, to provide a solid and stable tested environment.

No fucking way.

**First** is the contracting process.

There is a mechanism by which National Grid will contract generators to operate as per their forecasts of demand. Such contracts operate from very short to very long term (for example, it was in the news in late 2014 that Longannet Power Station would not bid for any 2018/19 contracts) and are, naturally, subject to some inaccuracy.

Wind Turbines, as you'd expect, operate on the shorter-term contracts because predicting wind very far in advance is not an easy task. Other generators operating on similar short term contracts are often ""peaking plants"", who are paid to cover small surges in demand that may only last 10-30 minutes (think everyone putting the kettle on during the advert break of something popular).

If a turbine is contracted to produce power and there ends up being too much power, it is paid to not produce that power any more.

**The second** is constraint payments, and the reason wind farm constraint payments are going through the roof is because they're all in Scotland and the capacity to export to England is limited, and is indeed well below what Scotland's wind farms *could* export on a good day.

As such, the ""problem"" is National Grid's: they're telling the wind farms to stop producing not because there's any surplus, but because they simply can't accommodate them and have to give their contracts to generators in England, who are on the other side of the bottleneck and thus not affected.  Unfortunately, wind farms rather rip the piss with that and submit their bids to reduce power output at high prices (3-4 times what they'd make if they kept spinning).

As such, the wind farms are raking in shedloads of cash from the balancing mechanism because National Grid has no choice but to pay them or watch the lines between Scotland and England literally melt.

Action is being taken. A huge (2.3GW) new undersea power cable is being laid through the Irish Sea between Scotland and England to give them more export capacity, the existing lines are being upgraded, and there's plans waiting in the wings for another subsea cable running under the North Sea if there becomes a need for it.",null,0,null,1420455364,null,0,false,0,cnf07us,null,t3_2rdwiy,null,t1_cnf07us,null,t3_2rdwiy,null,null,null,1425050031,null,38,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,38,null

From the book ""The Blunders of Our Governments"":


'... unusually for an IT project, the prime minister of the day was centrally involved, at least at the outset. Tony Blair as prime minister had among his overriding objectives the ""delivery"" (the word he always used) of high-quality public services in general and reform of the National Health Service in particular. He was determined that the NHS in England should become more eicient on his watch, more effective and infinitely more user-friendly. Blair wanted to universalise the best practive that already existed in parts of the health service, and he had been one of the principal drivers of the ambitious ten-year plan for the NHS that the government had launched in 2000. 
Two years later, in February 2002, following a Downing Street seminar that the prime minister chaired personally, the Hepartment of Health announced a massive overhaul and expansion of the health service's IT infrastructure. One of its many aims was to create, within, it was hoped, about three years, a single electronic system for storing patients' records so they could easily be accessed and shared among England's 30,000 GPs and roughly 300 hospitals. Initially, only authorised professionals would have access to the data, but it was hoped that in the fullness of time patients could access their own records. The directorate within the the Health Department responsible for delivering the new system later described it, probably accurately, as ""the world's biggest civil information technology programme"". In other words, the English NHS was being asked to play in the same league as the United States department of Defense and NASA. Not everyone was convinved that the UK Health Department was capable of competing in such illustrious company. Even before the project was formally launched, one well-informed commentator asked: ""Is the NHS up to the task?"" He went on to answer his own question: ""History suggests not."" He was right. It was not.

At the beginning, in 2002, the idea was that national standards for NHS IT would be laid down but that local NHS trusts would be left free to commission their own suppliers and choose their own software. However, Richard Granger, an IT consultant imported from Deloitte to take overall charge of the project, decided instead to nationalise it. No longer would there be a significant element of local control. Instead, the entire project would be managed from the center, by an agency called Connecting for Health (CFH), with Granger at its head. Under this new dispensation, there would be five regional programmes, but each would have a monopoly IT supplier and each of the monopoly suppliers would be chosen by Granger and his people. In addition, all five of the regions would be linked by an England-wide IT ""spine"", the supplier of which would also be chosen, in practice, by Granger and Connecting for Health.

CFH was based in Harrogate. Down in London, at the DfH, ministers and officials were clearly much impressed by Granger. The acquiesced in the arrangements he proposed and for the next five years they left matters almost entirely in his hands. The whole process of drawing up what were called ""output-based specifications"", of inviting supploers to bid for the main contracts, of considering the bids as they came in, of choosing the firms to be awarded the contracts and then of negotiating the contracts themselves - a process that usually took two or three years - in this instance was collapsed into one year. All the contracts had been signed by the end of 2003, and all the contractors were large, well known and well-established firms such as Accenture, BT and Fujitsu. 

Signs that the project was in serious trouble were slow to emerge, largely because the principal players - the DfH, CFH, the main IT contractors and Granger himself - were all, for obvious reasons, anxious that no signs of trouble should be allowed to emerge. Ministers were committed to the programme and frequently lauded it. CfH had deadlines to meet. The main suppliers were anxious to avoid the ignominy of failing to meet their contractual obligations. Granger, a proud man, was keen not only on succeeding but on being seen to succeed.

But during 2004 and 2005 it did finally begin to become apparent that all was not well. The BMA warned GPs to exercise caution before agreeing to participate in trials of the scheme. A poll of both GPs and hospital doctors pointed to growing doubts among medical practitioners about the scheme's security. One of the main contractors, Accenture, responsible for two of the five regional networks, chose to incur a substantial loss and withdraw entirely from the scheme as soon as it became clear that there was no way in which it could meet its deadlines. Estimates of the total cost of the programme over a decade edged upwards - and sometimes bounded upwards - from £2.3 billion at one point to £6.2 billion, then to £12.4 billion, then (it was rumoured) to somewhere between £31 and £50 billion. Any cost savings that were made would not be remotely commensurate. A drumbeat of press criticism, muted at first, grew progressively louder. Both the Daily Telegraph and Guardian, improbable allies, cast doubt on the viability and confidentiality of the scheme, and Computer Weekly repeatedly expressed technical and organisational doubts. Worst of all, although ""delivery"" was one of the main aims of the exercise, CFH and its contractors were signally failing to deliver. The system was supposed to be up and running in about three years. While 155 administraton systems for hospitals were meant to be delivered by the spring of 2007, in the event only 16 were. In London the corresponding figures were twenty-four and one. In truth however, the hospitals to which the systems had not been delviered, the great majority, could count themselves lucky. Where the systems were installed, they frequently crashed totally, malfunctioned in other ways and/or failed to connect with other systems that they were supposed to connect with. In September 2006, Computer Weekly reported 110 ""major incidents"" across the English NHS during the previous four months alone. More than twenty of them had affected multiple sites, among other things preventing medical staff from viewing x-rays on screens in wards and operating theatres.

Nevertheless, against all the accumulating evidence, most of the five secretaries of state for health who served under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown during the lifetime of the project - Alan Milburn, John Reid, Patricia Hewitt, Alan Johnson and Andy Burnam (an average of just over two years each) - continued to insist that the programme as a whole was worthwhile and if it was not already proving a success, it soon would be - and the junior ministers in direct charge of the project offered their own reassurances. However, political support for the project crumbled. The House of Commons Public Accounts Commitee in April 2007 published a report that was damning even by its high standards, and by the end of that year Richard Granger had departed the scene. Alistair Darling, Gordon Brown's succesor as chancellor of the exchequer, made it clear that he was reluctant to continue funding the project, and in August 2009 the Conservatives, who had been sceptical all along, announced that, if returned to power, they would dismantle Labour's ambitious national, that is, England - wide scheme and instead encourage local NHS bodies to make their own arrangements. Within months of coming to power in 2010, the coalition government announced that, although some of its elements would be retained, the grandiose programme inaugurated by Tony Blair in 2002 would be wound down and in September 2011 health ministers, after yet another damning report from the Public Accounts Committee, announced that the Labour government's centralised programme was, in effect, being scrapped altogether. Many billions of pounds, rather than mere millions, had been wasted, though no one could authoritatively say how many. A frequently cited figure was £20 billion, more than enough to build three dozen general hospitals.

From its inception, the whole thing had been either, at best, a mess-in-waiting or at worst, a mess already apparent. It began, more or less, at a meeting in Downing Street between a prime minister who knew next to nothing about computers and a clutch of computer enthusiasts. It was wildly overambitious. It was far from being essential. No one ever seems to have subjected it to a serious - or even a back-of-the-envelope - cost benefit analysis. The programmes alleged benefits, if even they accrued were going to be outweighed many times over by its exorbitant costs. No one ever thought to ask medical administrators and practitioners whether it was a high priority project from their own point of view, or how they expected this new programme to mesh with their existing IT arrangements, or whether they would want to opt into the new system, or, come to that, whether they believed the proposed system could actually be made to work. The timescale proposed for the project was ludicrously short. Delays were inevitable. In the early stages of the scheme, no-one seems to have addressed the crucial and predictable issues of patient confidentiality. On top of all that, large parts of the enterprise were were hopelessly mismanaged, in so far as they were managed at all. The rate of turnover of officials at the Health Department was even higher than in the case of the FiReControl fiasco; the project had no fewer than six departmental ""senior responsible owners"" during the first two years. Largely because the intended end-users of the scheme had been so little consulted, the various IT suppliers often had no clear idea of what they were supposed to be supplying - and in some cases merely sold the NHS whatever they happened to have on hand. One large-scale subcontractor was slow to deliver contracted-for software amidst allegations of accounting irregularities. 

As time went on, critics of the project used more and more colourful language to describe what was going on. A well-informed report in Private Eye attributed the shambles to ""political vanity, official incompetence and vested interests"". But the flavour of the way in which the whole programmed evolved was perhaps best captured by a witness who gave evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, someone who had tried to warn his superiors at the DfH about the consequences of the departments failure at the outset to consult clinicians:

""In those early days it was like being a juggernaut lorry going up the M1, and it did not really matter where you went so long as you arrived somewhere on time. Then when you had arrived somewhere, you would go out and buy a product, but you were not quite sure what you wanted to buy. To be honest, I do not think the people selling it knew what we needed.""

But of course the people selling it usually sold it to them all the same. It was left to taxpayers to pick up the bill'

The Freedom of Information Act is an incredibly misunderstood piece of legislation. It doesn't give people the right to know everything about everyone. In the crudest sense it establishes in principle a ""right of access"" to information held by **public authorities**. Hold onto that *""public authorities""* bit for a second.

What are public authorities? You can see a full list on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_2000#Public_authorities), but in short they are Government departments, their various machinations and companies that are **wholly owned** by the state. There are a few specific exceptions (like the Secret Services... for hopefully obvious reasons)

So why doesn't it apply to the Royal Family? There are a few big misunderstandings here...

* The Royal Family are a family. They are like your family or my family. We call them the Royal Family because they are a famous family. In a sense you could think of them like other famous families - the 
Arquettes, the Baldwins, the Rothschilds etc. They are famous in so much as they are related to the Queen and contain those in the line of succession. However, the ""Royal Family"" doesn't have any executive power as a family. There isn't even a strict definition of who is in the Royal Family. **They also don't receive public funding**. Instead each year the Government pays something called *""[The Sovereign Grant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Grant_Act_2011)""* to ""The Crown"" which is something slightly different but inter-related... so what is this ""The Crown"", and why is it different from the Royal Family?...

* The Crown is something else entirely. ""The Crown"" (not the shiny metal hat) is something called a **corporation sole** (i.e. a corporation occupied by a single person) that represents the legal embodiment of the executive, legislative and judicial governance in the Commonwealth. **The Crown is NOT a public body**. The Crown is effectively a private corporation. Public bodies operate beneath the Crown. Queen Elizabeth II at the moment holds the Crown. Who holds it next is determined by 3 things...  The Act of Settlement 1701, the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and Common Law. It's important to remember - **Elizabeth didn't choose to be Queen**... the Monarch inherits it. 

The bottom line is the Royal Family are as entitled to their privacy as anyone elses family. The real question ought to be ""Why is **The Crown** exempt from the Freedom of Information Act""... and the answer to that is simple... it basically isn't, since all its power is divested in public bodies which **are** covered by the act. 

If you want to use the Freedom of Information Act to read Prince Charles private mail to government, or to find out how they interact with government you'd need a new piece of legislation... and it would be an utterly disgusting piece of legislation at that. Because if private individuals can access that sort of information from The Crown, what hope do the rest of us have of privacy?

**TL;DR: If The Crown is able to exercise undue power over public bodies like the BBC, then that isn't a problem with the Freedom of Information Act... It is a problem with the Royal Charter under which the BBC operates. That is what ought to change - not the personal and private liberties of our sovereign.**  ",null,0,null,1420456603,null,0,1420456788,0,cnf0gv3,null,t3_2rbxpw,null,t1_cnf0gv3,null,t3_2rbxpw,null,null,null,1425049914,null,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27,null

There is a reason that our constitution is considered so flexible and changeable: it regularly changes depending on the time. We call this adaptation and it is a Good Thing(tm). Having a fixed constitution leads to things like people using a law which originally provided support for citizens to join and form armed militia against colonial oppressors/native Americans to justify carrying guns and there is literally nothing the government can do, it has to play along like it's still 1790. 

Other countries that have this game of pretend include the backwaters of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Monaco. Compare our stability to somewhere like Germany (head of state unable to stop World War II and Nazi atrocities) or France (state has collapsed due to presidential turmoil in 1890 and 1957).

2. Switzerland experiences Direct Democracy and the people therefore had full expression to reject *all forms* of the EU including the EEA hence their Bi-Laterals agreements and EFTA membership.

The UK being a Commonwealth Country had a full trading relationship already but wanted EU EEC access ALSO. This was a massive failure but precipitated due to the malaise of War Debts to the US from the World Wars. Effectively the UK elites chose incorrectly and they also deceived the Democratic System we use in the UK Parliamentary Sovereignty as documented in this FCO paper:-

This would **never** work in the UK unfortunately. They literally cannot help but spread absolute bullshit and misinformation. Look at AskFrank.

They cannot resist the urge to use propaganda... because the truth is that this is the **only** reason the drug war exists as it does and continues as it does.

Even with the truth they mix in half-truths and only half-finish a sentance.

For example;

[Check this out.](http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/cannabis)

&gt;Cannabis effects how your brain works. It can make you feel very anxious and even paranoid, it can make it difficult for you to concentrate and learn, make your memory worse and make you feel less motivated.

All true, as far as I know. I don't mind they don't state the risks proportionally, that's understandable.

However ""make your memory worse"" I believe is a deliberate attempt at bias. They're trying to imply it makes your memory **permanently** worse. This is a lie, or at the very least a matter of conjecture and should not be presented as fact.

For example I could say **exactly** the same thing about not enough sleep. It makes your memory worse. Should we make the internet a Class B drug after 9pm so everyone gets enough sleep?

That's just one small example... pretty much every single bullet point contains the same things.

&gt;Tobacco and cannabis share some of the same chemical 'nasties' and just like smoking tobacco, smoking cannabis has been linked to lung diseases like tuberculosis and lung cancer.

True, however there is a HUGE amount of conjecture here also. Cannabis has hundreds of studies saying it has no link to lung cancer. [Even Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/cancer-questions/does-smoking-cannabis-cause-cancer) says that it's ""difficult to say exactly what the risk is""... but of course Ask Frank jumps on the opportunity to make it seem needlessly harmful.

I mean seriously, this is a direct quote from Cancer Research UK;

&gt;[...] they could not find **a significant link** between marijuana and cancer

I'd also like to point out that you can 'take' Cannabis without smoking it. There are dozens of ways to consume it such as edibles or vaping which has none of this risk. **If this is about public health, why not say thats an alternative to reduce risk?** The answer is because it's not. It's about scaring kids away from drugs altogether, not about education and harm reduction.

&gt;Regular, heavy use makes it difficult to learn and concentrate and research has linked cannabis use to poor exam results.

Again, absolutely true... but isn't it important to point out that research has also pointed out that once you stop smoking - even if you've done so regularly and heavily for decades - you'll return to normal again?

It just makes me so angry. Cannabis is not a safe miracle drug. It's not safe for children. There are health risks. But **nobody** should trust the UK government to be honest with them when they are clearly ramming an agenda down your throat as hard as possible at literally every single opportunity.",null,0,null,1420458559,null,0,1420458997,0,cnf0vdl,null,t3_2re3g2,null,t1_cnf0vdl,null,t3_2re3g2,null,null,null,1425049726,null,62,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,62,null

They rely a lot on tourism and the money it brings so they're pretty inviting. 

I don't know what your budget is, but there's lots of places nearby for food and drink etc. 

* Turfcutters arms - good pub, with a good selection of ales and food. prices are average/little above average but the plates are full.
* Royal Oak (nr. Exbury/Beaulieu) - good selection of local ales and ciders. Serve food, but i've not personally had it.
* Monty's bar in Beaulieu is convenient but expensive as the restaurant is michelline stared  
* Snakecather in Brokenhurst has good reviews - but i've not eaten/drank there myself in many years
* THere's a weatherspoons in Lymington called the six bells, so you know what you're getting there. 
* There's also the ""Angel &amp; Blue Pig"" in Lymington too which is recommended, but can be more expensive. 

* Afternoon tea - try Limewood house - it's a 'proper' afternoon tea experience, waited service in stunning grounds/building. £23ea, but it is worth it. 

* If you're after a nice dinner, then i very much recommend you try the 'Pig in the Forest' they source everything from their garden or within 40 miles of the site - and it's all based on what's locally available at that time of year.  
Mains are around £15. we tend not to have starters, but have the 'piggy bits' tapas style stuff to start - the crackling strips are amazing. food is stunning, been there many times and not had a bad meal. would book in advance though.

In the past, the role of foodbanks was to help those who 'fell through the gaps' of the social security net.

You'd be surprised at how many people that covers, but often its the people at the very bottom of society who no one else has the patience for.

Increasingly however the role of food banks is to act as a second social security net just for the people that job centres can't be bothered with; all it takes is for you to miss you sign-on appointment by 5 minutes and you can get sanctioned for a month, and need a month worth of food bank parcels (which is incidentally, all a food bank will normally give you in a year). There are also a lot of people who are sent to food banks just while they wait for claims to be processed,so the government doesn't have to give them anything straight-away.

&gt; Most women do not commit crime

Most *men* do not commit crime. Yes, most criminals are men, but this is not representative of men. Not sure what's being said with this point, really.

&gt; Women commit a different range of offences from men. They commit more acquisitive crime and have a lower involvement in serious violence, criminal damage and professional crime

So this necessitates different sentencing for the same crimes?

&gt; Prison is disproportionably harsher for women because prisons and the practices within them have for the most part been designed for men

So, openly admitting that the system is designed to punish, rather than rehabilitate, prisoners, and this becomes a problem only when women are imprisoned?

&gt; Women and men are different. Equal treatment of men and women does not result in equal outcomes.

This bit is particularly grating. Women and men should be treated the same unless men are treated badly in which case treat women better.

No. You want equality, improve the bits you don't like *for everyone.*

&gt;Most were mothers. Some had their children with them immediately prior to custody, others had handed them to relatives or their children had been taken into care or adopted.

So, tough shit for criminals who are fathers?

&gt; They were drug users. It was not uncommon to have £200 a day crack and heroin habits disclosed. 

Fairly certain drug habits affect both genders.

&gt; They were alcoholics.

Fairly certain alcoholism affects both genders.

&gt; They were not all the same, they were individuals.

Much like *literally every person on the planet.*

null,false,Jim_Panzee,null,null,null,"Ok. I need to get this off of my heart. I really love and hate this season because of the following reasons.

I liked:
* Capaldi is a great actor. He creates a dark doctor while keeping the core of the character intact.
* Missi was absolutely gorgeous played.
* Clara is the first companion that can really keep pace with the doctor. (Even more than Donna, because she does it in an intelligent way.)
* The episodes were all enthralling.

BUT The scripting had some real bad moments. Especially the resolutions found to some problems:
* That arrow thing at the end of Robot of Sherwood... 
* The reappearance of the Moon after the alien hatched out of it. (Sure. It just poops out a new moon, in the size of itself, with exactly the same craters...)
* Missi just got shot by this general Cyberman? What an End for such a great character? (I really hope she just teleported, but anyway thats no appropriate end for the season nemesis.)
* I know, it's Doctor Who and not some kind of hyper realistic science fiction. But there is a kind of ridiculousness that I like (the spoon fight with robin) and one that I don't like (see points above).

Than there are some general things I didn't like:
* While I generally like Clara as a really emancipated character that despite being strong, also has weaknesses, I started to dislike her. It's mainly not the character itself. She just gets way to much screen time to the point where it is the Clara-Show and not about the doctor anymore. And that Tardis-Key-Throwing-Thing made me really hate her. Also all that lying was really unnecessary.
* Missi is just a great role. But her motives are really not matching that of the old master. I wished she would have gotten more screen time with the doctor and a better plot.
* Danny was also a cool character that I wished would stay. At least he was the only real ""good"" one in this season. But it's ok when people die in the series. It gives decisions more impact. But the way he finally died was stupid. It's as if Clara wanted to kill him. And the doctor helped her, for what? A stupid piece of information he could just asked Missi for?

While this all sounds rather bad. It really isn't. In the end, I liked this season.

No, absolutely not. **They** do not *""actually get out money in practice""*. The Crown receives the Sovereign Grant.

I would argue, that being born into a job (something none of us have ever had to contend with) and all the public pressure that goes with it, means fair remuneration is important. Lets also consider that Elizabeth II would have retired **28 years ago** if she were ""one of us"". She's done more in her life than you've done in yours i'll wager. I'd go further and make the case that a wealthy monarch makes good sense - it gives us a head of state that is unmotivated by the acquisition of more wealth and an individual who can parley equally with the richest and poorest in the world.

At any rate, this subject of finance aside (which was ancillary to my main point about their rights and freedoms as individuals). **[It has been well covered elsewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhyYgnhhKFw)** and its an undisputed point that The Crown generates more income that it receives in public finance... without even touching on the ""soft benefits"" of having such a respected head of state.

your startup costs are anything from 5-15k depending on exactly what gear you go for. Insurance for that is gonna be a grand a year , plus liability insurance, business set up costs and so on. Computer and software costs are another 1k at least. 


You can get a loan for all that, call it a 20k loan over 3 years, you'll be paying ~ £1000/month on that back. 
Your gear is going to need replacing every 2-3 years so that loan is essentially permanent expense. You can probably buy on credit etc to reduce that down later.


Typical wedding is going to be ~3hrs of work plus travel, but you can only really ever do one per day. average price will be ~ 800+ depending on exactly what they go for. you can charge more later for reprints etc but that's pretty rare, most folks will order one set of photos at the time and that's it. You are also responsible for the costs/quality of those even if you use a 3rd party for it, so that's even more profit gone. Call it ~ 100 in printing costs per time.


it's going to take at least a day after each one to do all the backups/post processing/ordering, so that limits you to basically one per weekend or 3 a week at most. You also need to chase payment and have insurance for when people dont/cant pay. 


So your first two-three weddings of the month covers your costs. So you need a minimum of four a month, because three earns you less than minimum wage. 


For it to equal what I can earn working in IT with none of the pressure/stress , i'd be looking at having to do about 12 a month. Which doesn't sound so bad, but is increasingly hard to get that level of work - people have cameras of their own or don't want to spend the cost et, and to get up to that level you have to run at a loss for a while, plus spending on PR , social media, advertising etc. Plus if it takes you more than one day to do the post-processing/printing stuff, then you can only do 10 a month maximum, or your prices have to go up a lot, which you cant do till you've got experience.


most wedding photographers actually do it as a side gig - they'll have another photography job (product shots, corporate stuff, etc), which makes most of the money, and the wedding stuff they do just because there's demand for it.",null,0,null,1420462778,null,0,1420462999,0,cnf1v67,null,t3_2rdu0i,null,t1_cnf1v67,null,t1_cnf1jxl,null,null,null,1425049262,null,3,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,3,null

I think the cannabis has made you paranoid here. I didn't read it as necessarily ""permanently worse"", although there is theory and debate that this might be true, so maybe it is best to be vague about it?

Personally I'd like to see the information presented how you get with prescription drugs. Where you get the different headings:  

* ""These side-effects are common (1/100) and nothing to worry about:"",      
* ""These side effects are rare &lt;1/1000"",   
* ""These side effects mean you should stop taking the medication and contact your doctor""

&gt;For example I could say exactly the same thing about not enough sleep. It makes your memory worse. Should we make the internet a Class B drug after 9pm so everyone gets enough sleep?

This part of your argument just doesn't make sense. As someone who's suffered from chronic insomnia, I really don't think you should trivialise how serious the effects can be - certainly much much worse than cannabis use.

I changed jobs (2.5 days to go!) , had some great feedback from interviews etc there, and it confirms that I'm worth way more than even my new job is paying. But that's alright, it's still a 20% pay rise and a great opportunity , plus no on call :D , so I'm really looking forward to it, even if i am a bit nervous! Kinda sad to be leaving old place after 3.5 years, but thats a long time in IT. Made some good friends here so it could be a lot worse.


dated a nice lady for a short while in 2014, didnt work out, but that's alright. Had a lovely holiday to venice/croatia with some friends - hoping to go back to the family house in croatia later this year and maybe Lisbon to see the sea otters :D (americans are mean and wont export them so there are only 2 in europe now!).


nephew was born, he's ~ 6 months old now and getting to the cute toddler stage soon, rather than generic babyness. Much more fun to interact with now.



Next year i want to travel more (new job will have some opportunities there), I want to visit scotland again if i can, its been years since I got up there, and i have a project to get enough good photos to make a 2016 calendar for xmas from them. That's going to be hard work.

Then you sidestep the issue by pointing out that it sent the 'quality of rental housing stock plummeting', which is beside the point of cost.  Cost being the primary driver or people wanting rent control, not quality.

I find it curious that people only want to show the examples where it doesn't work (especially out of context examples), but refuse to accept evidence that it does - like in Germany (we have a lot more in common with them than the US in this regard).

Your lack of vocabulary is startling.  Socialism is not the same as communism.  Neither of which were practiced (in reality) in China or Soviet Union.  Staying in context I was referring to the capitalist socialism that all of Western Europe employs to different degrees (Sweden to a higher degree than most).  Many of the countries with higher socialism consistently have the highest standards of living.  Cost and quality of housing of course a major part of that determination.

~~You really open your argument with this? Really?~~

[~~Your first sentance is immediately ad-hominem.~~](http://i657.photobucket.com/albums/uu295/DanfromtheHills/argument-pyramid.jpg) ~~Firstly, how do you even know I smoke? Because I have an opinion on it? Don't be an idiot. Secondly... counter my argument, not me as a person.~~

Edit: I'm a dick, he was kidding. Years of having to defend this opinion lead me to jump to the wrong conclusion. [In my defence...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) 

&gt;I didn't read it as necessarily ""permanently worse"", although there is theory and debate that this might be true, so maybe it is best to be vague about it?

It's a public information website. It's not supposed to be - or presented as - an opinion piece.

It is open to the public and presented as a good place for children (and adults) to get accurate unbias facts about drugs. That is it's purpose.

So with that in mind... you cannot argue it is crystal clear. Nor that most people wouldn't simply assume it's permanent. Especially people like parents who are naturally looking for the negatives if they have a child smoking (inspired by 40 years of propaganda).

&gt;Personally I'd like to see the information presented how you get with prescription drugs. Where you get the different headings:

Personally, I would too... as I said in my original comment. However I forgive them for not doing so, as it's supposed to be succinct and child-friendly.

I think they can't do that though anyway because they actively prevent testing of Cannabis on a large scale to figure out these numbers accurately. And I wonder why they do that? Oh yeah, because the tests kept coming back positive and disproving negative assumptions.

&gt; As someone who's suffered from chronic insomnia, I really don't think you should trivialise how serious the effects can be - certainly much much worse than cannabis use.

Wow. Your very first sentence is trivialising and dismissing my entire argument by being condescending and calling me paranoid... then you're throwing out this.

Firstly, I never trivialised it. I pointed out that lack of sleep has health consequences such as sub-par memory. How on earth is that trivialising it? 

Maybe lack of sleep is making you paranoid? /s

Secondly, I'm illustrating how absurd it is to try to paint having a poor memory as a severe problem **whilst actively using Cannabis**. If you're actively using any drug or have an ENORMOUS variety of minor conditions (such as lack of sleep) your memory is affected. It's completely normal.

Thirdly, it returns to normal. It isn't permanent (unless you're a teen). That's very important - they don't mention it.

null,false,bottomlines,null,null,null,"Agreed. Plus the ""softer"" argument that you should let kids be kids. Let them explore, fuck up etc, within safe surrounding.

Asian culture basically treats kids like mini adults. It gives them a massive workload, long working hours, high stress and pressure to succeed. They have less time for socialising, and fucking up at all isn't tolerated. Whereas I feel Western culture allows kids to screw up and still do ok in the end. You learn the lesson. Flunk a couple of exams and realise you need to work harder. But under a lot of Asian systems, fail one test and you're screwed. So as well as the huge pressure, they never learn the value of failing.

(And on the other hand, I must note that Asian culture then proceeds to treat adults like children - with people living at home until their 30's, their parents being super involved in their kids' relationships, micromanaging their kids' finances etc. Very strange!)

I've spent considerable time in Asia, including some of those on the list with the ""best"" education systems. I noticed that so many young adults have no hobbies, or if they do, it was competition. They wouldn't play guitar or piano for the hell of it. They'd do it so that they could win competitions. And they were quite often pushed by parents rather than self motivated.

You're right. Western graduates are the best by far. And the UK really is exceptional in this regard.

I'm sure there American guests that are are smart and funny enough to make some good episodes, but I'm not so sure it will be sufficient for a long running show.
 
First of all the British can laugh and joke about everything - including themselves. In America there are a lot of things you can't joke about and self-deprecation isn't a natural thing for lots of Americans. I'm not saying that every American will hate such humour - certainly not - but it will make it a lot harder to find an audience. You can see this in shows like Never Mind The Buzzcocks. A guest like Meat Loaf understands he's there to participate in a show and just goes along with what's thrown at him, All-American hairmetal singer Sebastian Bach made a complete fool of himself with his hey-I'm-a-big-rockstar-attitude. He just didn't get it. 

Secondly: many of the celebrities in the UK appreciate science and are erudite. (Don't forget a lot of comedians and actors are university educated.) The US imho seems to have a lot of celebrities who are celebrities just because they're on TV a lot, not because of any particular skill. The UK has these celebrities as well, but they seem to be more prominent in the US. 

Let me stress once more I know lots of Americans are smart and funny, but I think that on the whole both the number of possible US guests for the show and the potential audience for a US Qi are relatively small.

null,false,decemberwolf,null,null,null,"&gt; The actual statement was: ""Isn't it scandalous that we're not training enough nurses and doctors in our own country"" You seem to have interpreted that statement a bit differently than I did.

Define ""enough"". That is the heart of the issue. Define it. Give us figures, hard facts, actionable data. Quantify what your party means by ""enough"" and then how you plan to resolve the issue, with actual data. Being given the statistics your argument hinges on by the journalist shows that actually, Mr Farage has not done his homework and is talking out his arse.

&gt;With the actual statement, what is the problem with that? He is basically saying he wishes for more of the NHS staff to be British.

So you vote for a man who wishes for things? He doesn't even know the numbers of how many aren't British. For all he knows and can evidence, there are 3 Poles and one Indian and that's the lot. The opinion is fine and dandy, and yes I can see why one would want that but you asked me to find evidence of him not having his figures in this video and I have provided it. I'm not here to argue about the content because it is based on hearsay, make believe and brown data.

&gt;What you're saying with whether he'd sack them is another issue completely, he was saying that NHS staff if they can't speak English ""surely they shouldn't be employed in the first place"", the question shouldn't be if they should be sacked or not as they shouldn't be in the NHS to begin with.

Which is exactly my point. He has not offered any solution. This is fine for you or I in this situation, but this man is marketing himself as *the* solution for all of UK's woes, and yet he can't conjure up even a rudimentary idea on the spot. I can think of plenty of methods for fixing the issue even without the numbers, and I'd be able to do so in his position without issue. The fact that he can't should be ringing alarm bells.

&gt;I think it's a little silly and a bit rude to label somebody with a different opinion on things as an idiot. 

If you follow the words of a man who does not have any data to back up his claims, nor does he even know whether the data does or not, you are an idiot. You are allowing a man to define policy on your behalf based on information he himself admits he doesn't have. This isn't a matter of differing opinion, this is a matter of someone being factually incorrect and making decisions based on guesswork. If you select such a person to lead you, you cannot be very astute. Sorry if that is offensive, but we aren't having a conversation here about feelings or philosophy, this is a factual discussion and Farage was unable to bring any facts. Look at how willing he was to accept that 11% number without question. That's the sign of a man who both accepts what he is told at face value (an idiot) and who has not done even rudimentary research in to the issue he claims to be important to him (also an idiot).

However, we should make that competition more fair than in the current marketplace.

In particular, nuclear companies should be required to purchase full insurance against the event of any sort of a nuclear accident. This isn't currently required, and this in effect represents a huge hidden subsidy to the nuclear industry, since if an accident occurs then the public would end up paying for it. This makes nuclear appear to be considerably cheaper than it should be in many official figures. I've heard pro-nuclear people say that modern reactor designs can't possibly cause major accidents. Let them make the case before the insurance companies, who are likely to be much better judges of accident likelihood than either politicians or the general public.

How so?

""Then you sidestep the issue by pointing out that it sent the 'quality of rental housing stock plummeting', which is beside the point of cost. Cost being the primary driver or people wanting rent control, not quality.""

Not just quality, quantity too. But anyway: So you would be happy for the quality of rental property to become even worse, as long as its cheap?

""I find it curious that people only want to show the examples where it doesn't work (especially out of context examples), but refuse to accept evidence that it does - like in Germany (we have a lot more in common with them than the US in this regard).""

Correlation does not imply causation. Please find me any evidence that rent controls actually help provide affordable rental accommodation in Germany. In fact, please find me a study that has found this *anywhere in the world*. How does the property market in London have more in common with Germany than NYC/SF anyway?

""Your lack of vocabulary is startling. Socialism is not the same as communism."". 

Ermm... Socialism and Capitalism are alternative economic models, which is why I compared them. Communism is much more than just an economic model, and does not compare directly to capitalism. What were you saying about vocabulary again?

""Neither of which were practiced (in reality) in China or Soviet Union""

Completely comes down to what you define as Socialism.

""Staying in context I was referring to the capitalist socialism that all of Western Europe employs to different degrees (Sweden to a higher degree than most). Many of the countries with higher socialism consistently have the highest standards of living. Cost and quality of housing of course a major part of that determination.""

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2837086/Face-nightclub-worker-accuses-Briton-crying-rape-Student-faces-extradition-slandering-Italian.html

&gt; In the case of Miss Bowes, who has waived her right to anonymity, they said detectives had viewed video footage from the nightclub and concluded her rape claim was false.

&gt; As they were walking to the VIP section of the club, Miss Bowes claims he dragged her into a unisex toilet and raped her.

&gt;After a while she said she heard a friend, who had grown concerned about her, calling her name and she dashed out of the cubicle on her own, and left the nightclub with her friend.

&gt;She denies claims that she kissed her alleged attacker after they came out of the toilet.

&gt; But a police source told the Mail: ‘They were hugging and kissing after coming out of the toilet. This is what the nightclub [CCTV] video shows and what witnesses told us. The hospital told us there were no signs of any injuries or assault on her body.’ 

Sounds like someone got drunk and regretted shagging in the bog since the CCTV footage is said to show them hugging and kissing on the way out.

Quantify what your party means by ""enough"" and then how you plan to resolve the issue, with actual data. Being given the statistics your argument hinges on by the journalist shows that actually, Mr Farage has not done his homework and is talking out his arse.

Right, I get what you mean, I don't speak for UKIP but I'd assume he simply wants the amount of foreign doctors/nurses to become lower than it is right now, after doing research it [appears that 11% is the amount of all NHS staff that aren't British, as for doctors and nurses that figure is higher at 26%](http://www.pharmafield.co.uk/news/2014/01/NHS-would-e2809cstrugglee2809d-without-foreign-workers). The only thing he mentioned was that the amount of foreign workers in the NHS is increasing, this is backed up [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-299257/4-000-foreign-staff-join-NHS-year.html)(apologies for linking a daily mail article)

&gt;Which is exactly my point. He has not offered any solution. This is fine for you or I in this situation, but this man is marketing himself as the solution for all of UK's woes, and yet he can't conjure up even a rudimentary idea on the spot. I can think of plenty of methods for fixing the issue even without the numbers, and I'd be able to do so in his position without issue. The fact that he can't should be ringing alarm bells.

I think the solution he is stating is pretty obvious, he wishes to spend money to train more doctors/nurses here in the UK to allow local workers to be more attractive.

&gt;If you follow the words of a man who does not have any data to back up his claims, nor does he even know whether the data does or not, you are an idiot. You are allowing a man to define policy on your behalf based on information he himself admits he doesn't have. This isn't a matter of differing opinion, this is a matter of someone being factually incorrect and making decisions based on guesswork. If you select such a person to lead you, you cannot be very astute. Sorry if that is offensive, but we aren't having a conversation here about feelings or philosophy, this is a factual discussion and Farage was unable to bring any facts. Look at how willing he was to accept that 11% number without question. That's the sign of a man who both accepts what he is told at face value (an idiot) and who has not done even rudimentary research in to the issue he claims to be important to him (also an idiot).

I understand what you're saying here, however being ignorant doesn't make you an idiot, maybe he should have gone into that interview with more facts to hand but actually, we don't know how much research he did as he didn't state anything either way, the only thing he asked for was for more British workers to be employed into the NHS, he may have done his research beforehand to state that or maybe the research was done by somebody else in the party, my point is that the points he made aren't wrong just because he didn't bring up any statistics.

null,false,DC_Coach,null,null,null,"This is probably the best answer I've seen to the OP's question (love Moffat's quote), so I can only second it. 

I'll also suggest to the OP that you could do far worse than to do what I did: start with the 2005 revival, series 1 episode 1, ""Rose"", and work your way forward from there. As said elsewhere on this thread, all of what you'll be looking for (earlier seasons of the revived series) is on Netflix.

S1 (2005) has its ups, downs, etc., just stick with it if you can; the highlights of S1, for me, were these three episodes: ""Father's Day"" and ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances."" If you're really digging it so far, make sure and watch all of S1, in order, but especially look for the last two episodes of that season: ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting of the Ways.""

If you make it through to series 2, many of them are great; my highlight episode of S2 is ""The Girl in the Fireplace."" 

My favorites in series 3 are ""Human Nature/The Family of Blood"" and ""Blink"" (which is one of the most well-regarded episodes in the history of the show, but might not be, IMHO at least, the best introduction to Doctor Who **for a first-timer**; I just think that there's just so much going on in that episode, IMO ""Rose"" is far better for an introduction because it eases you into what the revived show is all about, without overloading you with information; once you get the hang of things, there will be plenty of time to watch and thoroughly enjoy ""Blink"").

In S4, my recommendation is to look for ""Planet of the Ood"", ""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead"", and ""Midnight.""

Once you've seen a half-dozen episodes, including those I and others listed, if you then decide its not for you, then IMO at least you've given at least the revival-era Doctor Who a fair shake. 

On the other hand if you end up liking what you've seen so far, heck, you've got a WHOLE lot left to enjoy. Maybe you'll even do as some of us have and start watching the old show, which is fascinating and quite rewarding in its own right. 

My final recommendation is this: if you know you're going to watch the revived Doctor Who, go back and watch them in order, even if you have to re-watch some episodes. It'll make everything far easier to understand, plus it's always rewarding to pick up on references to earlier episodes, characters, and events.

I've seen every episode in the new Doctor Who, almost all of them twice, some of them three times (I've maybe even seen a couple of them four times, as I've watched them with family members on their first trip through the show). I've seen/listened to some of the Classic era shows, and am working to see/listen to all available Doctor Who. 

This show is like nothing else on television - EVER - in my opinion, and is well worth the hours I've put into it. I'm just sad that I only realized all of this a few years ago. You're far younger than me, with more time - go for it!

This is a separate form of harm reduction. I was specifically saying a public information website (run by the government) would never work here because of the bias. And we know that because it exists and it's heavily bias.

I thought the primary purpose for the website you linked isn't public-facing, it's for individual users to find out whats in their drugs - on a personal level - and for the government to have a easy method to monitor what is actually on the streets.

AskFrank is public facing and is about information in general.

&gt;Constitutional monarchy is a form of government in which a king or queen acts as Head of State.

&gt;The ability to make and pass legislation resides with an elected Parliament, not with the Monarch.

&gt;As a system of government, constitutional monarchy separates the Head of State’s ceremonial and official duties from party politics.

&gt;A constitutional monarchy also provides stability, continuity and a national focus, as the Head of State remains the same even as governments change.

&gt;The Sovereign/Monarch governs according to the constitution - that is, according to rules, rather than according to his or her own free will. The United Kingdom does not have a written constitution which sets out the rights and duties of the Sovereign, they are established by conventions. These are non-statutory rules which can be just as binding as formal constitutional rules.

&gt;As a constitutional monarch, the Sovereign must remain politically neutral. 

So if Charles is using his royal influence to alter legislation then he could be abusing his position. If he continued when he became king then it would be a serious constitutional matter (that is if the public ever found out about it).

I'd rather us subsidise production than control output prices though. Making more of a thing is always better than taking too little and capping the price. A price cap on grain doesn't change that there isn't enough grain. Cheap grain that doesn't exist feeds no people. Cheap houses that don't exist provide no shelter.

As-is the market in the UK offers little incentive for investors to develop new or improve existing properties (e.g. adding value), because the return is greater on buying any property whatsoever and renting it out / letting it appreciate.

Ergo currently best used resources for a landlord is to buy more properties to maximize exposure to a rising market rather than buying one and improving it.

While I say they ""rip the piss"" it's more of a personal opinion and the way they do it still makes economic sense, even if the headlines sound bad. If they started submitting truly ludicrous curtailment bids (which some power stations actually do completely legitimately) they'd shoot themselves in the foot because they'd never be contracted to provide anything (out of fear of having to cancel them), they would get undercut (other wind farms would submit less ridiculous curtailment bids to get the money and the greediest wind farm would be the one left spinning) and due to the loss of confidence from the system operator wind farms as a whole would lose investment because their revenues would decline as contracts became rarer.

They make themselves appealing because they can bid to *provide* power at extremely low prices for two reasons. First, no fuel costs means they're not losing a lot of money by generating and second the Renewables Obligation Certificates make up about half their revenue anyway, so their bid price to National Grid isn't even their whole revenue stream. To National Grid's pricing mechanisms, wind is really cheap and so offers the optimal economic solution, resulting in contracts being offered.

Mass constraints isn't an everyday happening. The current settlement they've ended up at (3-4x operating price) is a market equilibrium. It's a price that means they're fairly likely to still be contracted and reap revenues if cancelled.

null,false,decemberwolf,null,null,null,"&gt;Right, I get what you mean, I don't speak for UKIP but I'd assume he simply wants the amount of foreign doctors/nurses to become lower than it is right now, after doing research it appears that 11% is the amount of all NHS staff that aren't British, as for doctors and nurses that figure is higher at 26%. The only thing he mentioned was that the amount of foreign workers in the NHS is increasing, this is backed up here(apologies for linking a daily mail article)

The statistics you found in about 15 minutes, he was unable to bring to the table for an interview on a topic he himself espouses. Do you not see anything wrong with that? 11% is a very small number. If you flip the statistic and say ""nearly 90% of NHS staff are British"", suddenly everything seems ok and it is a non-issue. Farage is plying the statistics game in the hopes that idiots think the issue is bigger than it is, so he can suck votes from them.

&gt;I think the solution he is stating is pretty obvious, he wishes to spend money to train more doctors/nurses here in the UK to allow local workers to be more attractive.

then why does he need you to answer the question on reddit, when he should be answering this in the interview for us all to hear from the source? He hasn't said that, for all we know his solution could be to paint his ears green and pray to Roger Rabbit. We have no evidence to the contrary except that the idea is silly and unlikely, but you won't find any evidence to disprove this from his interview. Intelligent people want answers, not wishy-washy rhetoric.

&gt;I understand what you're saying here, however being ignorant doesn't make you an idiot

Being ignorant does not make you an idiot, but turning up unprepared for an interview you have asked for is not ignorance. It is negligence or stupidity, but not ignorance.

&gt; we don't know how much research he did as he didn't state anything either way

which is exactly the point I made, he has made plenty of sweeping statements and not backed anything up by fact. Following that man makes you an idiot if you believe in him as a genuine solution to the problems.

&gt;my point is that the points he made aren't wrong just because he didn't bring up any statistics.

a broken clock is still right twice a day. Do you really want a PM who works with guesses and feelings? I'm not in a high level role in my work, but I'm expected to have statistics to hand for things I bring up. If I say ""the network is slow"" I am expected to provide data for this to quantify the issue. If he as a candidate for most powerful man in Britain cannot produce any rudimentary statistics for his talking points (which isn't limited to this interview) then we have a serious problem with his capabilities.

He has also been wrong on many other occasions, and let's be honest 90% of staff being British is actually not a problem, so he is wrong here. We don't need more British workers employed in the NHS, things are fine as it is. We were only able to make that decision because someone *else* provided the data.

As to my original point - Farage uses sweeping statements and refuses to provide supporting data because the facts do not marry with his rhetoric, and because he appeals mostly to the uneducated who don't tend to fact check things, he will get plenty of votes.

&gt;At the FOI appeal tribunal in September 2010, Paul Richards, a former special adviser to the former communities secretary Hazel Blears and health secretary Patricia Hewitt, said that it was clear to him that Charles regularly corresponded with ministers and these letters went ""to the top of the pile"" and are ""treated with great reverence.""

&gt;Conversely, the letters from ordinary citizens ""...go through a centralised mailroom and which are normally dealt with by departmental staff and rarely seen by ministers or their advisers."" 

&gt;Richards had been a special adviser from 2005–09 and said that Charles wrote on issues including planning applications and government health policy.

&gt;**Richards believed that lobbying from Charles had contributed to a £1.1m grant awarded to his Foundation for Integrated Health. Richards believed that the grant arose after ""behind-the-scenes lobbying"" from Charles, and occurred at the same time as a reception hosted by the prince at his London residence, Clarence House, attended by at least one health minister and an adviser to Prime Minister Blair.**

The wikipedia page for the [Foundation for Integrated Health](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Integrated_Health) link starts with 

&gt;The Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH) was a controversial charity run by Charles, Prince of Wales and founded in 1993. The Foundation promoted alternative and complementary medicine, preferring to use the term ""integrated health"", and lobbied for its inclusion in the National Health Service. The charity closed in 2010 after allegations of fraud and money laundering led to the arrest of a former official.

It also contains

&gt;The Prince personally wrote at least seven letters[14] to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) shortly before they relaxed the rules governing labelling of herbal products such as the ones sold by his Duchy. A move that has been widely condemned by scientists and medical bodies.[15]

&gt;On 31 October 2009 it was reported that Prince Charles had personally lobbied Health Secretary Andy Burnham regarding greater provision of alternative treatments on the NHS.[10]

An alcoholic or addict to any drug (or indeed to anything at all) will, at some point, have put enough of it into themselves to develop an addiction. I certainly would call that a mistake. 

But, as I did already say, it's a technicality. Drug addiction of any sort results, at least in part, from use of the substance you become addicted to (you don't get addicted to heroin if you never take any heroin). Other mental illness just happen to you.  

It may not be a necessary distinction to make, but you can logically make it. Unfortunately there is a tendency to disregard a person's problems when they are perceived as ""self inflicted"" so in that regard it may be a dangerous distinction, but that doesn't mean it should be denied. 

It doesn't matter why someone has a problem. If they can be helped, they should be.

Drugs are illegal in Amsterdam too, they just don't enforce the laws where it comes to soft drugs *with the aim of rehabilitating recreational drugs users*. There's no where in the world outside of the two US states and Uruguay that have legalised drugs with the goal of allowing people to freely use drugs. All of which did so in the last 12-24 months so it's not really a good indicator at all.

Plus Amsterdam shows the highest levels of other drug use, including hard drugs, in all of Western Europe, so it's hardly a shining example of drugs policies at work. The other country to have decriminalised (Note: this does not mean legalise) cannabis is Portugal, which also reported an increase in drugs use. 

&gt;And I meant drug related crimes - muggings, buglary and shit like that.

Ah right I see, well then I must commend you on your knowledge of crime reduction statistics world wide, especially considering you didn't even know that Amsterdam hasn't legalised drugs at all.

Doubly especially since all the places in the world that actually have legalised drugs wont actually have anything approaching a comprehensive data set by which you can judge whether there is a general trend of decreasing crimes and what their causes are.

Your point was that Frank is providing factually correct information, it's just pushing a government agenda, something you ""backed up"" with the fact they say cannabis has long term negative effects on memory, but it actually doesn't.

You're then literally told by someone that it does and they provide actual evidence that you're wrong, which you claim you 100% agree with. Yet for some reason you don't think this changes your point at all, and you admit ""you might have been wrong"" instead of you were ""talking shit"" which would have been far more accurate.

I then read a comment where someone, in a totally non-hostile way, suggests that they have used Frank (also btw implying they have been involved with drugs in some way, either personally or by association, so not totally clueless on the subject) and they disagreed with your assessment. You then basically told them their opinion means shit all unless they are going to back up what they said with scientific fact, despite the fact you didn't back up your earlier claim (i.e. that cannabis has no long term side effects on memory) and in fact got proven totally wrong and even agreed (but still thought you are right some how).

You're the type of person who undermines any type of argument at all for the decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs because you talk total shit and can't even recognise when you have had your argument totally proven wrong. Instead of formulating a counter argument (which you could have done as there are plenty of studies saying cannabis doesn't have long term effects on memory) or even simply acknowledging that their point was valid like an actual adult, you just dug your heels in and said ""Nope!"".

You sound like a 16 year old stoner who has had a few spliffs and thinks wouldn't it be great if it's all legal without actually knowing anything about it. 

The only thing Frank can be accused of if providing information which is contested (but not refuted) by scientists in order to discourage drug use, which frankly shouldn't be a surprise considering they are an organisation that is supposed to discourage drug use.

I took a call centre job in Stoke as a temporary thing and now I'm in a great job living in London, and I wouldn't have ended up here without a whole string of events working for my first company.

Secondly you need to take the shotgun approach to job hunting. If you only get 1 interview for every 50 applications, that just means you need to do 400 applications and you'll definitely get a job. It's pretty soul destroying getting rejected again and again if it does happen, I wont lie, but the ones that do well are the ones that stick it out. Going back to my first point, after you have a job it's much easier to move to a different one. 

As for interviews themselves, turn up looking smart, for guys this means a suit and tie, even if you know they don't wear suits and ties (I have gotten away with a suit and no tie before, but you need to be REALLY sure it's the right move). Remember you're interviewing them as they interview you. Ask lots of questions and remember you don't HAVE to take their offer.

It doesn't have permanent effects on memory. That is fact.

**Unless** your brain isn't finished developing. AskFrank does not make that distinction. It presents it as the opposite... and leaves out the ""unless"" part. That is bias and misleading.

&gt; Yet for some reason you don't think this changes your point at all

It doesn't...

My point was that AskFrank is ""telling half-truths and half-finishing sentences"". And that's exactly true.

You're just trying to troll and make drama here where there is none.

&gt;You then basically told them their opinion means shit all unless they are going to back up what they said with scientific fact, despite the fact you didn't back up your earlier claim (i.e. that cannabis has no long term side effects on memory) and in fact got proven totally wrong and even agreed (but still thought you are right some how).

You really are grasping here... you're just seeing what you want to see.

I said exactly what I wanted to say. I pointed out that he disagreed with me in the most pointless way possible without any evidence what-so-ever.

You want evidence? Really? Well all you had to do was ask.

-[The new study of cognitive changes caused by heavy marijuanna use has found **no lasting effects** 28 days after quitting.](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/10.11/marijuana.html)

-[But a new study says no: the researchers followed nearly 2,000 young Australian adults for eight years and found that marijuana has little long-term effect on learning and memory— and **any cognitive damage that does occur as a result of cannabis use is reversible.**](http://healthland.time.com/2011/07/19/study-marijuana-not-linked-with-long-term-cognitive-impairment/)

Not happy with articles on studies?

-[Some cognitive deficits appear detectable at least 7 days after heavy cannabis use but **appear reversible** and related to recent cannabis exposure rather than irreversible and related to cumulative lifetime use.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11576028)

Is that what you call ""getting owned""?

&gt;You're the type of person who undermines any type of argument at all for the decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs because you talk total shit and can't even recognise when you have had your argument totally proven wrong.

And you're the type of person who is... well, a troll. Unfortunately I'm not falling for it.

&gt;simply acknowledging that their point was valid like an actual adult, you just dug your heels in and said ""Nope!"".

What the hell are you talking about? Do you have some sort of memory issue yourself? I already not only said I told them they have a valid point, aknowledged it (you even said I did... seriously, do you have memory problems?) and said it was right and agreed with it. What are you talking about? Again I repeat... you're just making things up and inventing things which haven't happened in some lame attempt to troll.

&gt;Instead of formulating a counter argument (which you could have done as there are plenty of studies saying cannabis doesn't have long term effects on memory)

As I've now done, now what? You'll just make up something else to fit your argument most likely... hmmm lets see... you'll nitpick those options I've selected? You'll maybe find some which make counter-claims without even realising that still doesn't prove me wrong...

&gt;The only thing Frank can be accused of if providing information which is contested (but not refuted) by scientists in order to discourage drug use, which frankly shouldn't be a surprise considering they are an organisation that is supposed to discourage drug use.

Wow... the true scale of mental gymnastics here is becoming clear now. You decided you didn't like me, so you decided to troll by jumping your way into the fact I'm wrong and an idiot... despite that statement right there.

That's almost exactly what I'm accusing. I'm accusing them of providing information which is contested and presenting it as not-contested.

I'm accusing them of trying to discourage drug use through misleading and incomplete information.

&gt;Just like how other government adverts discourage smoking and drinking, or encourage healthy eating.

Wrong.

AskFrank is advertised as an unbias 'safe space' to find out unbias information on drugs. That's the entire purpose of it... and it fails at that job because the information is presented in a bias manner.

That was my point, and you seem to agree... yet still insist on insulting me personally.

We are not, but one of the main reasons I love Tottenham is what I see as a genuine ambition and motivation to improve and reach that top level.

I am quite aware that not everyone who takes a drug becomes addicted to it. What I am saying is that in order to become addicted to a drug, you must first take it. It is not always a mistake to start taking drugs or drinking, but it is still something that you do to yourself. Hence addiction has a point of origin in an action you have personally taken. Thus it differs from other mental illnesses. 

Do you think I'm trying to blame people for their addictions? Is that how this is coming across?

I work for a company in Regulatory Affairs in the Pharmaceutical industry, and I'm not aware of a single case in the past 30 years of substances being shipped labelled as something else. It just doesn't happen in this country.

null,false,EvilActivity,null,null,null,"With a Stocks and Shares ISA you need to pick a stock in which you want to put your money. This brings along more risk, since the stocks could plunge to 0, or rise. You have to chose where you invest it in.

A normal ISA is like a savings account. The bank gives you a steady % back. This is not too high, since the bank will be taking all the risks.

If you do want to save it for a longer period and want to minimize risk: put the money in a fund (take a look at vanguard as a starting point, it offers multiple funds in different markets). A fund is a collection of stocks in different companies, so that if one company goes down, it's only a small part of the complete fund.

The downside of putting money in stocks/shares is that if the market goes down, you'll want to wait until it goes up again in order to avoid losing money on your investment. That's when a cash ISA would come in handy, since you can withdraw it whenever you want without loss, (unless you fixed it for a certain period, which might give you a penalty). You can always transfer your cash isa to a stocks/shares isa if you desire so.

If you need it in a very short time frame, you might be better off with a different savings/current account with a higher interest rate.

tl;dr: don't need the money for a long time: you can put it in a fund through stocks/shares. not sure if you need it in a shorter time frame, keep it in a cash ISA.",null,0,null,1420479296,null,0,false,0,cnf8r55,null,t3_2revtx,null,t1_cnf8r55,null,t3_2revtx,null,null,null,1425046016,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

&gt; Can Choosing to Live with Less Make You Happier?

While the points made on the show were all valid and well put, it was almost entirely given by older, middle class people (may callers in their 70s) where clearly they didn't need any more, and were freed up by giving money and items away. 

While this all is find and to be expected, it did rather bring into question of [Sam Vines' Boots economic theory](http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Sam_Vimes_Theory_of_Economic_Injustice) - i.e, the richer can afford better quality stuff, and thus can buy for life rather than having to buy 10 pairs of shoes at £10 because they don't have the money at once to buy £100 pair of shoes. 

I just can't imagine the people on the show actually really realised why people had so much stuff, and that it's not always fuelled by greed but rather a necessity that because you can't buy your child a £400 rocking horse, a shit ton of stuff from the poundshop will have to do.

They have a template for making a little pet CV you could use when contacting people. I pay a slightly higher security deposit but nothing else. I started my search well in advance of moving to give extra time to find a place that would allow my dog. I visited 3 or 4 flats, letting agents all said dog shouldn't be a problem, any listings I saw that specifically mentioned no pets I just didn't bother with. Found a great flat in a  good area that accepted the dog so definitely doable. I'd recommend getting something in writing saying the dog was approved.

He's got the track record at Liverpool to warrant it, holds himself in good standing, and looks out for his mates on/off the pitch. An example that comes to mind is a more recent game against Swansea when Shelvey and Balo almost went at it. Skrtel knew and was waiting to defuse the situation, keeping everyone gentlemanly. The little things like this coupled with his dedication for Liverpool and his actions on the pitch are the reasons he definitely deserves it.

**Of course** it would be over the head of the average American viewer..  Which is why you produce the thing by and air the show on **PBS.**

The ""Duck Dynasty"" crowd would never view it on ANY network or cable channel.  The average American TV viewer wants nothing to do with intelligent, informative, educational programming.  They want to watch a bunch of selfish assholes throw each other off an island instead of learn about history, nature, the arts, etc.

So you get a terrific host and let PBS handle it.  The crowd who would watch the show is already there and waiting for it.  Neil deGrasse Tyson is intelligent and witty and would be perfect.  He can easily pull off the Fry ""superiority"" thing and play the part of Headmaster of the ""school"" if you want to duplicate that.  But that much duplication would be unnecessary.  Let the show's character develop on its own.

The host should be intelligent, well-educated, and have a sense of humor.  Never forget that Stephen got his start as a comedian - half of a comedic team on the BBC.  Which is why we could consider any of the following people as hosts:

Lewis Black

Jerry Seinfeld

Louis C K

Seth MacFarlane

Neil dG T

And now that I've had time to consider all the options, Neil dG T would be a terrific panelist rotating in and out with some other funny people.  MacFarlane is your host.  The rest of the list are good, regular panelists.  If there is to be a consistent sidekick, I'm at a loss as to who it could be.

Tottenham Hotspur

Outlook/needs: Having been through more transitions and wholesale changes than any other Prem club over the past couple of seasons, the key word for Spurs is ""stability."" Recently there have been signs that some of the much-criticised acquisitions that arrived in the post-Gareth Bale spending spree are starting to produce. In addition, their goal-scoring problem seems to have been solved by home product Harry Kane. Mauricio Pochettino has a young squad at his disposal with two reasonably adequate options for virtually every position. U.S. national team right-back DeAndre Yedlin, who impressed at the World Cup, joined this month from Seattle Sounders after signing in the summer. Slowly this predominantly newly assembled group is starting to gel. And although the improved form of Jan Vertonghen is a big plus for Spurs, there's still a desire to upgrade the centre of defence.

Ideal signing: Winston Reid | 26 | West Ham | 6 million pounds

As much as West Ham would hate to sell their best defender to what they consider their main rivals, they may as well cash in a few million pounds at the end of this month rather than end up with nothing in the summer.

I totally agree. The HIV figures have dramatically decreased thanks to the decriminalisation of drugs in Portugal, I also agree that was the main argument for decriminalising drugs charges. 

If the UK was facing a similar level of HIV infection from drug use I would consider advocating decriminalisation here, but that's not the case.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_%28Ireland%29#Analysis_of_the_government.27s_role

&gt;Although the potato crop failed, the country itself was still producing and exporting large quantities of food. Ireland exported approximately thirty to fifty shiploads per day to Britain, which was more than enough to feed the population. The food exports in conjunction with draconian laws have led some historians and authors to use the term genocide in relation to the tragedy
&gt;

&gt;The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Clarendon, wrote a letter to Russell on 26 April 1849, urging that the government propose additional relief measures: ""I don't think there is another legislature in Europe that would disregard such suffering as now exists in the west of Ireland, or coldly persist in a policy of extermination.
&gt;

&gt;Christine Kinealy expresses the consensus of historians when she states that ""the major tragedy of the Irish Famine of 1845–52 marked a watershed in modern Irish history. Its occurrence, however, was neither inevitable nor unavoidable."" The underlying factors which combined to cause the famine were aggravated by an inadequate government response.
&gt;

&gt;Several writers single out the decision of the government to permit the continued export of food from Ireland as suggestive of the policy-makers' attitudes. Leon Uris suggested that ""there was ample food within Ireland"", while all the Irish-bred cattle were being shipped off to England
&gt;

&gt; James Anthony Froude wrote that ""England governed Ireland for what she deemed her own interest, making her calculations on the gross balance of her trade ledgers, and leaving moral obligations aside, as if right and wrong had been blotted out of the statute book of the Universe.""
&gt;

I know it is bad form to quote from wikipedia instead of the individual sources but a quick Google doesn't back up your statement at all. The British may not have caused the blight but their reaction to the suffering in Ireland was minimal whilst still enforcing food exports does appear to be largely responsible for the mass starvation that desolated Ireland.",null,0,null,1420482552,null,0,false,0,cnfalcw,null,t3_2reclc,null,t1_cnfalcw,null,t1_cnf4nx1,null,null,null,1425045088,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

null,false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"&gt;My argument is just because someone this legal, or illegal doesn't mean people are going to stop, and through eduction consumption actually drops.

While I agree that long term education is the best way to reduce consumption of anything, in the short term banning it does *reduce* but will obviously not *eliminate* consumption.

The argument you can't stop a behaviour with a law is a logical fallacy, as no law stops any behaviour. People litter, speed, steal, and murder on a daily basis all over the world despite these being banned by laws, yet no-one argues their inability to *stop* the behaviour is a reason to abandon the law.

I'd also argue that the reduction in cigarette smokers is part education and part crippling taxation. 25 years ago in the UK 20 cigarettes would cost you £1.94 (or £4.21 in today's values) whereas today the same packet of 20 would cost £8.47, literally doubling the value. Combine that with the educational messages the government puts out, plus the (in my opinion) much more effective measure of banning smoking in-doors, we've tried to make smoking a socially *un*acceptable habit.

If we decriminalise or legalise drugs we risk it *becoming* socially acceptable to use drugs, which would increase over use. If you want evidence that this would happen look no further than alcohol. There's been a ton written about how binge drinking and frequent drinking has become far more socially acceptable, and it's lead to an increase of drinking and alcohol related diseases and injuries.

Smoking has declined because it's no longer as socially acceptable to smoke, binge drinking has increased because it's increasing seen as socially acceptable to go and get smashed to the state where you can't stand or talk. If we legalise or decriminalise drug use, it WILL become more socially acceptable, and there's no evidence to suggest that people wont partake more. 

&gt;Also, drugs being illegal is beneficial to politicians and their geopolitical aims and they have been used this way many times in the past, and the implications reach further than our streets.

Yeah maybe if you are alive during the cold war and you think the West is trying to prevent Communist influence in South America. Drugs has had very little to do with geopolitical interest for ages.

 http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/10/portugal-decriminalisation-drugs-britain_n_2270789.html

There's some good links in there showing that drug related deaths actually increased following decriminalisation, as well as Portugese reporting that they had taken drugs.

The figure your article refers to is the number of 15-24 year olds that say that they are using less drugs in a given week or month, not ""ever"".  Your article is interesting, but when I tried to read most the key sources they are written (unsurprisingly) in Portuguese.

The position taken by the article you linked is one that takes the view that the figures that matter is when you ask someone ""Did you use drugs in the last week/month?"". The logic here is that it's measuring the number of ""regular"" users, as you don't really give a shit if someone tried it once when they were 16 and they are now 80. 

On the other hand, because the figure only looks at the last week/month, it misses more casual users. If you only do heroin on special occasions (which sounds ridiculous but stick with it) then if someone says ""Did you do drugs last week?"" you'll say no. If you ask ""Have you done drugs ever?"" they would say ""Yes"".

The article you linked tries to discredit that statistic specifically because when you ask a sample of Portuguese people whether or not they have ever taken drugs, this number has *increased*. It's also worth noting in the article I linked it shows in the aftermath of decriminalisation in Portugal drug use *increased* while drug use in Spain *decreased*, so it's not like it's a global trend. 

The fact is if you want to think that the only stats that matter is whether or not people have taken drugs in the last 1-4 weeks, then I'm not going to change your mind as that has decreased. My whole stance is decriminalisation leads to drugs becoming more socially acceptable, and more people will partake in casual use, which wont necessarily be picked up by those statistics.

What happened was a little storm in a tea-cup.  This bit is my analysis, I'll try and provide links after.  Everyone thought that the tories would get it, then as the date drew closer it looked less certain.  This spooked things somewhat, plus the idea of going into a double dip kinda spooked things even more.  The simplest metric for investor confidence in the UK as a state is the gilt market, and as an economy the FTSE.  The FTSE was *volatile*, which was fun for me, because of my work at the time, anyway, it was mostly recovering in 2009 from a horrific over-reaction, then the winter time around 2010 people started to freak out again, and it dropped, it wasn't until the start of summer that it really started trending back up.  However you can see a big drop when everyone started worrying about things again, a hung parliament no doubt was a big concern too, but so most definitely was that whole *sorry, no money left* note that an outgoing chancellor left.

Now the GILT market was a bit different, as generally it's considered a lot, lot safer than the risky equities, but inherently illiquid with little upside reward, as such it behaves slightly differently, but still somewhat correlated.

Here are some links worth reading.

* [A rather stale 'live' blog shows how manic stuff went at the time](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7688646/General-Election-2010-Pound-Gilts-and-FTSE-react.html)

So what you basically see there is a trend of people suggesting why the Tories are prefered by the market.  I feel it would be just disingenuous to pick graphs alone to demonstrate this point (however it's easy to do so) because of how volatile the whole market was.

What I can certainly say is I've never met anyone who works in money markets, the kind that fund government debts, who thought in 2010 that Labour would have been anything but bad news, many feeling that they purposefully delayed controlling spending, to try and give them a better chance at the election, and to do that whole *blame the Dr for the bad tasting medicine* thing.

Money Markets are a strange one, and most definitely not my area of focus (equities) so please forgive me if I'm bad at explaining the sentiment of the gilt market.",null,0,null,1420484122,null,0,false,0,cnfbish,null,t3_2re711,null,t1_cnfbish,null,t1_cnfa14c,null,null,null,1425044655,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA#Adverse_effects), which naturally cites dozens of sources, suggests it's not entirely safe;
&gt; MDMA use has been shown to produce brain lesions, a form of brain damage, in the serotonergic neural pathways of humans and other animals.[1][4] In addition, long-term exposure to MDMA in humans has been shown to produce marked neurotoxicity in serotonergic axon terminals.[19][25][27] Neurotoxic damage to axon terminals has been shown to persist for more than two years.[27] Brain temperature during MDMA use is positively correlated with MDMA-induced neurotoxicity in animals.[19] Adverse neuroplastic changes to brain microvasculature and white matter also seem to occur in humans using low doses of MDMA.[19] Reduced gray matter density in certain brain structures has also been noted in human MDMA users.[19] In addition, MDMA has immunosuppressive effects in the periphery, but pro-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system.[28] Babies of mothers who used MDMA during pregnancy exhibit impaired motor function at 4 months of age, which may reflect either a delay in development or a persistent neurological deficit.[16][29]

&gt; MDMA also produces persistent cognitive impairments in human users.[2][15][16] Impairments in multiple aspects of cognition, including memory, visual processing, and sleep have been noted in humans;[15][16] the magnitude of these impairments is correlated with lifetime ecstasy or MDMA usage.[2][15][16] Memory is significantly impacted by ecstasy use, which is associated with marked impairments in all forms of memory (e.g., long-term, short-term, working).[15][16]

&gt; The most serious short-term physical health risks of MDMA are hyperthermia and dehydration;[25][30] this is due to a life-threatening complication – hyponatremia (excessively low sodium concentration in the blood) – associated with drinking large quantities of water without replenishing electrolytes.[25][30][31]

It also lists, under Psychological after-effects,
&gt; Memory impairment, some of which becomes permanent[15]

The truth has been obvious for a long time but nobody in the government or tv comes out and says it. The majority of people under 40 and especially under 30 get completely fucked, it doesn't matter what we do, we are trapped. 

We can go to university, study hard and end up saddled with high debts that will take two lifetimes to repay, or we can avoid university and get thrown from one zero hour contract to another with no hope of ever having a pension. 

Home ownership is a complete 100% fantasy for the overwhelming majority of under 30's. Instead, we are left renting Mr Babyboomer's second or even third home that he bought with his pension lumper or the profit he made from the house he bought for less than £500 in the early 80's that is now worth £500,000+.

5. Messi is ambassador of Turkish airlines, Chelsea's new shirt sponsor.
6. Messi is sponsored by Addidas, one of Chelsea's main sponsors.
7. Messi followed our instagram ;)
8. Cesc's wife liked a picture of Messi liking ChelseaFC
9. He has started following our players social media accounts
10. Barca having a meltdown, and Puyol being quoted as saying something like ""I quit after seeing this side of Barca"". This damages Messi's reputation. 
11. Messi's girlfriend just followed us on twitter.
12. He just followed Jose's daughter
13. My resources in spain tell me he is coming
14. RAC1 are reporting that Chelsea and Barca having conversations. 
15. Messi's agent has just got in touch with Daniel Levy as we speak to see if Tottenham will pay for his Flight &amp; medical to Chelsea. (found on twitter) (Thanks to /u/Reborno for this information)
16. Why does he do all that today? After being left on the bench, and then missing a training session. Is that just a coincidence?

* NHS / health as mentioned by /u/BernardTheBrave
* Supermarkets and other high street chains (anything with an online store)
* Publishers, especially education/academic ones since they have a lot of online courses and platforms to maintain
* Universities (potentially would let you get a staff discount on courses too)
* Larger not-for-profits
* Internet and utilities companies [like this](http://careers.virginmedia.com/job-search/job-details?id=DIRC%20-%20Tech%20Support%20Analyst%20Shift%20Worker)

Bear in mind that I don't know your specific skillset, so these are just suggestions, and you'll have to do a decent amount of digging yourself!

Keep an eye out for internal IT support and first- and second-line support jobs at these places. You'll almost certainly end up dealing with a lot of the same issues over and over, and the latter two will involve working on phone lines, but it's a good way to learn more about IT services and pad out your CV.

Also,since you are good at fixing computers, have you considered applying to electronic repair shops in your area? Another option would be to set up as a freelancer - start fixing issues for family and friends for a low fee, and use that to flesh out your CV too (you don't have to mention that your customers are all acquaintances...)

I'm not a farmer, but I live surrounded by farmland and forest and have kept chickens and have visiting ducks.

I've never seen what you describe, no. I *have* seen foxes take hens one by one via a hole in a fence into a pen, that wasn't noticed. I've also seen rats break open a clutch of near hatched duck eggs. That wasn't pretty. The only times I've seen a kill frenzy, as you describe, was a horrible Jack Russell.

As I mentioned, it's supposedly mink which will also do a lot of indiscriminate killing. I suspect there are a lot more of those about than people realise, and they can get through much smaller holes than foxes. 

As for sheep, I've found dead ones about fairly regularly, but usually it looks like they've broken a leg somehow first, and then crows and magpies have had a go at them.

The simplest (and arguably the best) way to go is to buy into a fund, which is a collection of shares grouped under a common theme. An example would be an index tracker, which owns shares in all companies which make up an index (like the S&amp;P 500). There are also themed funds which own shares in Brazilian companies, biotech companies, big energy firms etc. etc. So buying one share in a fund will get you hundreds of small shares in a diverse bunch of companies.

The way most S&amp;S ISAs work is that you sign up for one via an investment platform, like [iWeb](http://www.iweb-sharedealing.co.uk/share-dealing-home.asp) or [Charles Stanley Direct](http://www.charles-stanley.co.uk/). The platform gives you access to a range of stocks and funds. In exchange, you give some money to the platform - either a small % of your invested money each year, a fixed fee, or a fixes fee each time you buy a share.

thats about 45 million a year with chelsea mainly paying the wages. considering him coming in could mean schurrle departing and same for salah as well as other reductions its possible that messi could fit at chelsea under ffp without major hassles if adidas is willing to give parity to chelsea in relation to manU sponsorship.

the big elephant in the room is barcelona cant actually have any transfers in at the moment so unless they need money its basically not worth it for them unless messi asks to move.

null,false,kiirk,null,null,null,"&gt; I've never seen what you describe, no. I have seen foxes take hens one by one via a hole in a fence into a pen, that wasn't noticed. I've also seen rats break open a clutch of near hatched duck eggs. That wasn't pretty. The only times I've seen a kill frenzy, as you describe, was a horrible Jack Russell.

I only hear the occasional story, but it didn't seem that unusual. I don't know if you know much about pheasant shoots, but they have a special bird (I'm not a farmer so I can't tell you off the top of my head) which helps warn the pheasants of nearby foxes. So when they release the pheasants in the morning of a shoot they also this particular bird around. Well about 5 years ago I remember hearing the fox managed to kill this bird... which meant the fox also managed to nab the other 50 or so pheasants! The people on the shoot weren't too happy that day haha. Although that isn't really the purpose of the comment, its just a story of foxes taking all the birds because it can. 

&gt; As for sheep, I've found dead ones about fairly regularly, but usually it looks like they've broken a leg somehow first, and then crows and magpies have had a go at them.

I think with sheep it depends a bit on the location, my relatives farm is fairly safe and quite easily looked after from a distance, so if a sheep is injured its usually noticed fast. 

&gt; Farmers and gamekeepers don't really seem to be too bothered about foxes, and seem happy to have them keep down the rabbit population.

For sure, foxes are the least of their worries but you will notice them getting more angry when they know there is a fox on the prowl in the area. Currently the worst threat to my relatives farm is ash dieback.. knocking out ~3k of his trees (so I guess its no longer a threat). There are also plenty of other tree diseases on the increase too.

null,false,BLBOSS,eng-Bristol,Brizzle,null,"If they're hiring doctors who don't speak an acceptable standard of english it's because there aren't enough english/british doctors who want to work for the NHS.

I mean I remember a few years ago (so my information might be wrong now) but there used to be a large amount of Filipino nurses working in the NHS, many of whom had poor English skills. That's kind of a problem since, y'know, doctors nurses need good communication skills.

But it's not like they were untrained or bad or anything. My mum, a nurse, could attest that in terms of training they probably had better training than British nurses. They just couldn't speak the language.

So why were they being hired? Because of staff shortages and a lack of British nurses wanting to work in the NHS. My mum was forced to retire early because of health issues and she dearly loved being a nurse, but she also really really hated how the NHS was run (while also supporting it as an institution and not wanting to see it go).

So it's all well and good to waffle on about muh immigrants taken are jerbs or whatever but the reason these people are being hired is because the NHS treats its staff like shit and so British nurses/doctors don't want to work for it. If they don't want to work for it then the NHS needs to look elsewhere.

Sure the bigger earners will pay a higher proportion, but their numbers are far smaller than the paye masses. But that is another story really.

The main issue is that pensioner welfare is a pyramid scheme that is about to go pop without massive tax rises in the future. With an older population still holding the key to power in terms of votes, I can see a higher rate being brought in to appease the older voting bloc. They're hardly going to vote for wealth taxes.

Edit. I'm nit sure if I was being clear there, i don't want you to pay 75% taxes or anything silly like that. I would prefer other measures, cutting Trident or increasing death taxes.

&gt;After the prohibition was implemented alcohol continued to be consumed. However, how much compared to pre-Prohibition levels remains unclear. Studies examining the rates of cirrhosis deaths as a proxy for alcohol consumption estimated a decrease in consumption of 10–20%.[4][5][6] One study reviewing city-level drunkenness arrests came to a similar result.[7] And, yet another study examining ""mortality, mental health and crime statistics"" found that alcohol consumption fell, at first, to approximately 30 percent of its pre-Prohibition level; but, over the next several years, increased to about 60–70 percent of its pre-prohibition level.

So it reduced alcohol consumption between 10% to 70%.

FTFY. It's not as if British stormtroopers were marching around Ireland seizing sacks of wheat, twirling their moustaches and cackling wickedly as they did so. Irish farmers could get a better price for their crops on the overseas market, so overseas those crops went.

The typical line is that the British could have stopped the famine had they closed the Irish ports to food exports. This is perfectly true. If the British had issued a proclamation on this matter and then gone to Ireland with their guns and started forcibly making the Irish do as they were told - making them trade that grain locally rather than exporting it for more money - then the famine would have been greatly reduced.

But it doesn't suit your basic Republican loudmouth to suggest that what Ireland needed was _more_ British intervention in their affairs.

Similarly to Scream of the Shalka, this was one of a number of potential Doctor Who revivals in the early 2000s that were ultimately culled when the show returned to TV.

A couple years ago Dan Freedman, the producer of Death Comes to Time, secured the funds to produce an audio series centring around the Minister, in a new incarnation played by Julian Wadham.

While the production crew are insistent that the Minister is a Time Lord (and indeed his portrayal is entirely consistent with the slightly unusual depiction of Time Lords in Death Comes to Time), they obviously lack the rights to explicit references to the Doctor Who universe. However, with Doctor Who fans being the production's most obvious target audience, it made sense to cast actors who would appeal to fans of Doctor Who. Hence McGann, McCoy, Darrow etc.

The audio series was a few years ago now, and they're working on a movie, with a lot of the same cast as the audios.

When he plays shite, like has has for the past few weeks, you'll hear groans and moans, and the occasional ""FFS get a grip"" type shout in his direction.

Well, Kolarov, being precious, takes it very personally, and will occasionally turn to the crowd and have a pop back. I'm in the East stand, and he started doing it about 2 years ago. At the end of our failed title defence season, he reacted aggressively to a bit of stick near the South stand, and the crowd totally turned on him. It was a poor season, and we blew the FA Cup final to a relegated team who wanted it more. People believed some players didn't give it their all due to wanting Mancini out. And Kolarov's reaction exemplified that impression of mercenary players who didn't give a shit.

He'd done it previously that season, and people didn't react much, if at all. But this time, large sections of the crowd turned on him due to his gestures to the crowd. Some booed his every touch. At the end of the game he even singled out a fan and offered him out.

It's harmed his relationship with the fans, and in turn means people are less patient with his poor performances.

It's a vicious cycle, even when the crowd is giving the ref stick, you can see he's ultra vigilant for anything aimed at him, and often interprets it as thus even when it's not.

It makes him play even worse, because he's overly conscious of the fans to his left and not making an error. He appears to have a bit of a chip on his shoulder about it.

You can argue the toss all you like about whether or not it's right, but it's a poor reflection on Kolarov's professionalism and mental strength.

It's frustrating, and I don't see a solution given the relationship is strained. I believe we need a new left back in the summer anyway, and out of Clichy and Kolarov I'd keep Gael. Thank Kolarov for his contributions to our success in the summer, and part ways.

Big index trackers are relatively safe, for instance, as long as you don't sell out when the market crashes.

You might want to look into something like the [Vanguard LifeStrategy funds](http://monevator.com/vanguard-lifestrategy/).

The aim is to ensure that at least some of your capital stays safe in the case of a big economic downturn. The risk here is that inflation could rise above what you'd hope to receive from the bonds. There are different LifeStrategy funds, as detailed in the article. LifeStrategy 100 is the riskiest (100% of your money invested in stocks) and then it (theoretically) decreases in risk from there; for instance LifeStrategy 60 puts 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds.

Ultimately you're the only one who knows how much of your money you're willing to leave in the markets. If you're happy to let your 10K stew in a S&amp;S ISA for 10 years or so, you should be looking at returns well above your current 1.5%. The caveat is that if you need the money at any point, you might have to withdraw it at a loss. Always keep plenty of safe cash on hand!",null,0,null,1420493132,null,0,false,0,cnfgvth,null,t3_2revtx,null,t1_cnfgvth,null,t1_cnffqlw,null,null,null,1425042153,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

2. Cannabis can cause harm but it can also be used sensibly. Government should thus keep their noses out. Educate by all means, reduce harm definitely. Banning what can be done safely is not on though.

There is just a huge liberal streak running through people which is relatively new. Despite claims to the contrary 40/50 years ago students and similar mostly stuck very close to either large big state faction.

The idea of government being out of my business, my life and my risks, personal responsibility, etc is very new. Or at least it is a very, very old idea that has only recently become rather popular again.

It is slowly moving towards a liberal tipping point, most attitude surveys suggest a genuine even split. I just think right now most liberals aren't going to lay down their lives for drug users. I'd certainly agree with any government that reformed but it isn't top of my agenda. Despite being in favour I doubt any party could win my vote with a reform policy.

1. Stevie, as much as I love him, can provide some limited quality munches, much less in highly competitive games. It hurts me to even write this, but unfortunately it is true. 
2. We were playing Wimbledon, who have the bloke from the green mile as a striker. Mind you, he even scored against us.
3. (Cont.) so, we're obviously not Real Madrid, but we're Liverpool and should aspire to be better than fucking Real. 
4. Rickie is a player who is limited in what he can provide, we all know he is not a world beater, but until today, whenever he has been called he has provided. Definitely, his goal output doesn't confess to that, but he has always been at least a decent player in the filed, regardless of talent.
5. Balo wasn't called in the last international callup, much less started. Hint, his attitude played a rather big factor. 
6. I agree so much about our set piece tactics, I can't add to that.

- Gerrard had a great game in the advanced position. I hope that Rodgers has done all he can to keep him here otherwise we're losing an important player who can turn games in an instant, even at 34. 

- Balo looked great. He's creating more chances than our other striking options (bar Sterling) at the moment and I feel it's only a matter of time before he starts scoring pretty regularly; he's been fairly unlucky with his chances recently. 

- Why doesn't Skrtel just defend our corners like he attacks at the other end? It's a lot easier to header the ball AWAY from the goal than it is to get it in the net, yet he looks clueless in our own box.

- fuck Danny Murphy, when did he become so anti Liverpool? He wanted Wimbledon to score all the way through and hated when we scored the second.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"&gt;Why do you think that is? Is it collective delusion?

It's due to government incentives.

In the UK, the government pays a guaranteed minimum price for renewable electricity. In the case of onshore wind it pays a minimum price of £105 / MWh, and offshore wind £155 / MWh. The average market price for bulk electricity in the UK is £45 / MWh.

In Denmark, the government pays a subsidy of £40 / MWh for wind energy (this is paid in addition to the revenue from sale of the electricity)

In Spain and Portugal, the subsidy is about £60 / MWh for onshore wind. 

Wind energy has benefit of being low-carbon and high maintenance - so makes it is a compelling option for politicians looking to meet commitments in global warming treaties, and it also provides numerous skilled jobs. There are technical issues with its implementation, and power grid operators are running into problems (e.g. the current issue of lack of transmission capacity).

However, there are potential solutions. Smart grid technologies (e.g. intelligent power lines which automatically calculate their power handling capabilities depending on current weather conditions - wind provides extra cooling so, in windy conditions it may be possible to temporarily overload a power line without it overheating), demand control via smart metering, etc. One of the boldest and most expensive plans is a whole-Europe and North Africa ""supergrid"" - which would allows bulk transport of electricity from one side of Europe to the other, allowing changes in wind, changes in demand, etc. to be evened out across the entire continent. If I had to guess, this would probably cost in the hundreds of billions of Euros.",null,0,null,1420496517,null,0,1420496739,0,cnfisrf,null,t3_2rdwiy,null,t1_cnfisrf,null,t1_cnfdukr,null,null,null,1425041248,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

A goal line clearance? Really? Hardly his fault, he didn't lose his marker. 

The truth is he's still good enough to play for this club and we'd be were we are in the league without him. We wouldn't be any higher. I understand it took you like 35 minutes to find these gifs.

He would have been mortified to see that the same party he fought so rigorously against in the 80's were the ones who eventually passed marriage equality.

I will say this though; as a queer person myself I believe we (the LGBT) owe Cameron nothing, let alone our votes. It was the Lib-Dem's who brought the issue of gay marriage to the halls of power, Clegg is the unsung hero of this struggle. The Tory's didn't want to lose the religious maniac portion of they're voters so they were happy to ignore the issue.

Credit where credit is due, Cameron could have opposed Clegg on marriage equality. But he didn't so good on him. 

The nation today is so radically different to the nation Ashton knew. Back then, LGBT civil rights was an us vs them scenario. Gay vs straight. Now, as we move towards a time when being queer is considered as normal as being straight, it's not the case anymore. Mark may have been saddened to see members of his beloved community supporting causes he fought against, but I reckon he would have been able to see the bigger picture: Parents being more accepting of their kids, people in general being less hostile towards queer folk, the support from the authorities (namely the police) and the decline of power wielded by homophobic institutions (the different christian churches within the UK).

My bone to pick with the arguments against Stevie is that the psychology of those who critique him, especially with the state of our team as it is now, is totally off. Because Gerrard is an older player on his way down (and evidently now on his way out) everyone watches his games and his play with this constant comparison to how he used to play and how far down hes fallen, instead of comparing him to our own team and our own level of play. Meanwhile, players, who I dont care what anyone says, have not REALLY shown anything but ""potential"" are viewed with only the positives being taken into account. If Markovic, Can, Moreno, Sakho, Toure, Allen, Ricki and whoever else were all truly excellent players we wouldnt be having the season we're having. And dont get me wrong im excited about a lot of them as well, but they literally arent at the level Gerrard is still at right now in terms of confidence and clutch play. Would I agree that Gerrard goes absent in games, seems weak-legged and caught out sometimes? yes. But then, to be fair, so does Henderson, Manquillo blocked one of our own potential goals today doing god knows what, Ricki looked like he was on another planet, Can wasnt doing much etc etc. Again, you can argue otherwise, but the proof is in the pudding, we barely had anything going for us and we lose 2 goals and potentially the game if Gerrard isnt in there. Again, i know this is getting into a rant, but again idc how great markovic ""looks"", the guy has one goal. idc how good Can ""looks"", our defense still is shaky as hell. 

What im trying to say is Gerrard, due to his history and age, is viewed through a constant negative lens with the idea that we are a dominant team with the standards of bayern munich, while some of our other players can make clean 5 yard passes all game (ie that Emre Can highlight real against real madrid) and with their youth and our optimism we only really take into account the positives.

The wealth in the UK is in the SE of England. It's unfairly accumulated there until we get reasonable IHT laws to dissolve the magnetism of wealth.

This is one of the main reasons I oppose independence. Why on earth would we want to cut our ties with the rest of the UK while all the shares in companies operating in Scotland are owned by people in the SE?

The case for an independent Scotland being more progressive and fairer didn't stand up, in my opinion, when all we were effectively doing was removing our ability to tax the wealthy owners of the profits made in Scotland.

Just like it is not Scotland's Oil (what a horrible selfish concept that is) it is not the SE's tax.

For me the show has always been about the Doctor and I enthusiastically applauded nearly every companion death or departure from the show.


edit: Clarification and a rant
It's not that I hate the Doctor having companions, I simply want more of the doctor being the doctor and the show focusing on the doctor. With Clara as the current companion her story arc takes up most of the time in every episode and that really brings the show down for me. With the amount of time writers spends on Clara, it kind of feels like the production team is looking for more spinoffs aka the Sarah Jane chronicles. Stop it!


It's bloody Doctor Who but one would think it's ""the Clara Show"" or previous the Amy and Rory hour or the Rose effect. They had their written parts, they added their value but then the writers kept them in the show (way too long) and it feels really contrived, artificial almost desperate for lack of writing chops to find other plots that move away from these companions. 


As the post above states,  &gt; the stories seem to have lost a certain, imagination?


It's Doctor Who, C student master of time and space that can travel anywhere anytime and yet we find the shows revolving around neighborhoods on Earth in current timelines over and over and over and I look to the companions as the reason to keep the Doctor grounded on Earth in today's time. He hasn't had the TARDIS taken away by U.N.I.T and locked up after a regeneration. He's free to roam and yet episode after Clara episode they start off on Earth, with Clara having some problem that the Doctor doesn't need to be involved in getting dragged into her (as written) life and personal problems.


I don't care about Clara (as written), I want to watch the Doctor being that out of the box thinker, that mischievous know-it-all(most) relying on his wits and depth of knowledge to get into and out of situations that the TARDIS has firmly placed him in. 


I watch the old Doctor Who every weekend on our local PBS station. They're currently at the end of Romana's companion time with Tom Baker and Adric has just entered the show. These old episodes did story arcs within 4 to six episodes unlike today's multi year arcs. I think Doctor Who would benefit from these older story arcs, make them shorter (attention span) in terms of closure and move on to the next alien adventure and for writers sake, get off the bloody earth and get Galifrey back in the show - better yet go back to Galifrey when it was at the height of knowledge and power hundreds of thousands of years ago and move the show as far from ""current"" timelines and plots based around narcissistic earthlings as possible.

Please kill off the Clara character -quickly- she's dragging the show down from my perspective.

It's certainly not very well thought out. 

It mixes two elections what with the mansion tax being a Westminster issues and the number of nurses under Holyrood competence. Labour would then need to win two elections. It is also linking a vague policy (how many nurses we talking here) with a particular tax. Linking policies with taxes always sounds stupid (that's not how budgets work) but when the policy and the tax are in different Parliaments with Barnett in the middle it sounds particularly daft. 

It also leaves the Labour party open to questions.
Why, if you must link policies, is it not linked to a recently or soon to be devolved tax power? No faith in Smith? 
Why is it not talking about a reserved policy? 

On that last note, Ed Miliband's speech today offered disappointingly little in reserved policies and still seemed oblivious to devolution. I am amazed the extent that UK Labour still seem so utterly clueless about what is going on in Scotland and the very real risk to their 41 Scottish seats.

Edit: It also, as evidenced in this thread, can be spun against Labour in England.

It's tough to get in but if you do you'll learn loads in a very short time, interns there don't get stuck making the tea, you'll be writing, building and releasing code from day one. Esendex has taken on summer interns in dev before, so I would enquire.

You can get in touch at recruitment@esendex.com and check out the website at http://www.esendex.co.uk

My doctor prescribed Prozac which didn't work so I was put in something else which I more or less stayed on for 6 years. All that changed was the dosage increase. Every time I thought about giving up I either got the fear or my doctor gave a host of reasons why I should stay on them. It got to the point where I was a shell of man and had lost interest in pretty much everything. 

One day I woke up and decided enough was enough. No weaning off I just quit. I decided I needed to take control of my situation and improve my life and no more of the assisted crutch. At one point it was believed I might be slightly bipolar but since walking away from meds I'm much better. I still suffer from the blues but that's just me and life. I deal with it in my own way. Popping pills, not working, avoiding people and the issues that are part of depression only compound the problem. But as I said at the beginning, this is merely my take on MY experience.
