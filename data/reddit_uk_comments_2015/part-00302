But, responding to your comment: Nobody said that about Bent. We expected as much of Bent as Arsenal fans expected of Welbeck. A different type of player to what we had, but not much more than that. Martin Jol, at the time, said he was a good addition as he could run a lot. Which makes sense since we had one of the laziest strikers in the league (Berbatov), along with one of the slowest ones (Keane). Anyway, Jol was pretty explicit Bent was merely a back-up/alternative to Berbatov, Keane, and Defoe.

For example, an engineer is building a time machine and they find a notebook containing instructions on how to build one. They build the machine and then send a copy of the notebook back in time to where and when they first found it.

Future you exists because he saved past you so that you could become the future you to save past you. It's not that difficult a concept. Its also perfectly valid when dealing with time travel. The Doctor saves himself by going back to to give Rory his screwdriver so that the Doctor can be freed from the Pandorica so he can go back and give Rory the screwdriver to open the Pandorica. There's no beginning or end in this scenario, it just happens.

Edit: The same situation happens in the Terminator: John Connor is born to lead the resistance against Skynet and the machines so that Kyle Reese goes back in time to make sure John Connor's mother is protected so that John Connor may be born to lead the resistance against Skynet so that Kyle Reese can go back to father John Connor.

Moreover we have [multiple parallel lanes of education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Netherlands), which you are sorted into depending on your earlier results in primary and secondary eduction stages. So if you do not have aptitude for studying or do not put in sufficient effort, you will be moved to a less difficult lane and will also not hold back the people working hard to achieve university level.

The one negative I have found is that Chinese students often come in groups, stay within their groups and speak Chinese amongst themselves. They make little effort to connect with other students or Dutch society at large, which in turn results in them for example only seeing touristy stuff like Keukenhof instead of places that only Dutch people could tell them about.

*""China has one of the best education systems in the world.""* Which is why most parents with the money send their children to the West for university? 

Basically they mean that ""China has the best test scores"" in the world. The show mentioned this briefly, but this statement is also highly problematic. 

First, they don't say directly which test they're referencing here, but I'm going to assume it's the PISA exam. Technically, ""China"" had the highest scores in the world, but when you actually look at the situation BEHIND the high test scores you realize it's absolute garbage. 

**Problem 1: What is ""China"" anyway?**

Firstly, China's listing on the PISA exam is ""China-Shanghai"" because the Chinese government only released the exam scores of students from Shanghai. That's right, in a country of 1.3 billion, a city of 22 million was chosen to represent the whole country. The farm kids out in Gansu province? They likely didn't get a chance to take the exam at all, and if they did they certainly wouldn't have their test scores released.

Shanghai happens to be the richest, most developed city, with the most resources available. So basically to put it in a U.S. context, this would be like the U.S. isolating San Francisco or New York's scores while barring kids in poor towns in Alabama or Oklahoma from taking the exam. Them we turn around and call these results ""America's test scores.""

**Problem 2: Who is actually ""Shanghainese""?**

That's bad enough, but it gets worse. You might say ""while, big cities like Shanghai have poor people, so not all the kids have resources."" And you'd be right, but the problem is that you don't know about the *hukou* system, which is unique to China.

Basically, a *hukou* is a ""family ID"" of sorts which was designed to limit internal migration between cities and provinces. Your *hukou* is based on where your family comes from. So the millions of migrant workers who come from rural villages and move to Shanghai in search of a better life and factory jobs? 

They are not counted as citizens of Shanghai. They are legally still citizens of their home villages out in Sichuan or wherever. Which means that their students do not go to Shanghai public schools, but instead are segregated into special schools for migrant children. 

Guess who gets better resources: the native Shanghai kids or the migrant kids?
Guess who has richer families: the native Shanghai kids or the migrant kids?
Guess who takes the PISA test: the native Shanghai kids or the migrant kids? 

**Problem 3: Are the Selections actually random?**

If we're willing to dip into the world of rumors, there's an implied understanding that outstanding students are basically groomed for these exams, and then switched into the schools that are ""randomly selected"" to take them. 

I have no evidence for this but hearsay, so I'll leave it at that. But given the general manipulation of this PISA score we can already see above, it certainly doesn't seem out of the question. 

**Problem 4: Ignorance of Face-Saving Cultures**

The problem here is that the public in both the US and the UK (it seems) are easily persuaded by these ""scientific"" figures because they assume that China works the way that Western countries do. They assume that the Chinese government sees PISA as a way to diagnose deficiencies in their education systems compared to peer countries, and highlight areas that need improvement.

This is a profound misunderstanding of China. Remember that the phrases ""saving face"" and ""losing face"" are actually loan-phrases that came from Chinese into English. Much like the artificial inflation in the Shanghai stock index and the ""exactly on target"" GDP growth figures that everyone is suspicious of, any sort of quantitative measurement in China is not seen as a diagnostic tool, but rather a competition to be won. 

And if you can't win fairly, just move the data around until it seems like you actually won anyways. Even Chinese banks (which are government owned) don't generally believe official GDP statistics because they are assumed to be inflated for face reasons. Why would education be any different? The Chinese government sees PISA as an opportunity to gain glory and prestige in the international forum, by hook or by crook. 

And the idiotic thing is that a channel like the BBC parrots this nonsense, which falls apart under the tiniest scrutiny, as if it were an axiom.

So, why would they do that? 

**My Little Conspiracy Theory**

Just look at America. We are in the grip of a standardized testing war which is ripping our education system in half. Multi-billion-dollar publishing houses are making huge amounts of money by making standardized exams that kids are required to take before graduation. 

These companies of course make generous donations to politicians in Washington, like any big business. 

So even though the kids hate the exams, the parents hate the exams, the teachers hate the exams, and nobody even is totally clear on whether or not the exams measure anything useful, the exams continue and grow. 

Now, if everyone hates them, how do we get the public to support them and demand MORE exams for our kids?

Easy. We need an enemy to make us feel like we're falling behind. And what country is causing the biggest anxiety in the West right now in terms of global power politics? Of course, CHINA! 

In the same way that news channels scare up national security threats to keep defense budgets lucrative, the bogeyman of the AMAZING CHINESE EDUCATION SYSTEM is being used to line the pockets of the companies that make standardized tests. People will accept things they hate if they feel like they need to in order to fend off an outside rival. 

And so we have these ""reputable"" news outlets parroting nonsense because it creates hype and anxiety and fear, which always makes good television ratings.

In Cameron's 'Big Society' concept, he is keen in fostering charities to do work with volunteers and save Government a lot of money.  However in practice he achieved close to the opposite: of giving a lot of money to a supposed charity, but picking one that was highly inefficient.  So point one is that if you do give money to charity ensure that it is highly efficient and picks highly effective causes [See Effective Altruism for example](http://www.eaglobal.org/program).  This whole episode of Kids Company's rise and fall has underlined the folly of charity done relatively inefficiently and on relatively ineffective causes.  So point two is: For the co-ordinated well being of children, with a balanced approach of physical health, mental health, social services, education and housing to underpin and foster that well being you need Government.  No one, in my research, has demonstrated such a co-ordinated programme done for free or on the cheap.

There is never any need to 'cut back' state expenditure.  It's a pointless and ineffective strategy for deficit reduction, because of the fiscal multiplier of government expenditure.  The intelligent (Keynesian) strategy, which was extraordinarily effective at repaying the war debt over the second half of the 20th Century, is not to run surpluses but to let economic growth 'take the strain' of deficit reduction.  In particular, it's perfectly possible (and indeed usual) to shrink the national debt over time without ever running surpluses and paying it down directly.  We ran a surplus in less than ten of the financial years between 1950 and 2000, yet because of economic growth the national debt shrank from 200% of GDP to 40%.

This is possible for governments (and not for private individuals) because long-term economic growth exceeds the interest rates at which governments can borrow, so over time debts shrink as a proportion of GDP.  For private individuals this is reversed; interest rates exceed average income/salary growth, so debts must be repaid or they quickly grow large in relation to income.  Governments are different.  As long as there's no risk of creditors getting spooked and fearing default (which there was in 2010, but no longer), there is no economic merit in austerity.

&gt; Getting back into a surplus would be one of the best things this government could do for the country down the line.

Honestly, this is quite a silly opinion.  There's really nothing magical about a surplus.

null,null,moc_tidder_www,null,null,null,"Saving is the act of not spending, investing is what you do with the resulting capital. 

So putting your money in a bank account is still investing. 

What I assume you're talking about is asset allocation - I.e. Where to put your capital.  The advice on this will depend on your tolerance towards short term losses (volatility), actual losses (permanent loss of capital), and your need to access the money. 

Generally an emergency fund is a great idea. How many months' living costs you want is up to you. This should be kept in cash or short term debt instruments so that you can always access it in emergencies and it will always have a predictable value. 

Then you need to work out when you'll need to access your savings.  If you're saving for retirement, the traditional advice is to go for some mix of equities, bonds, real estate. Generally it's best not to invest in these things any capital you'll need in the next 5 years. This is because whilst in the long term they tend to appreciate, prices fluctuate and the value of your investment may fall significantly in the shorter term. For example, if you invest in shares and need your money in a year, and if the market falls, you may not have time for it to rise again and recoup your losses. 

This brings us to your risk aversion - in equities it's not uncommon for values to fall significantly.  If you're index investing you need to be able to ride this out without panicking and selling at low prices.  Can you sit comfortably when your portfolio has halved, and be confident based on past data that over a 30 year period it generally all comes out ahead?  If so, great. If not, you need to add some low volatility holdings. 

However, cash in a bank account has a huge risk, and one that historically is almost guaranteed to lose you money - inflation. Interest on bank accounts at the moment, and at most times in history, is lower than the rate at which the cost of things goes up, so in terms of what you'll be able to spend you're actually losing money. 

Hopefully that's given you some things to think about.  ",null,0,null,1438838415,null,null,false,0,ctt9qzd,null,t3_3fym4x,null,null,null,t3_3fym4x,null,null,null,1440311813,null,13,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,13,null

Certainly, we won't struggle for goals as we did last season.

On the other hand, we will be playing catch up to the big guys who did a lot of buying last season and had a season to bed them. People are carrying on going, ""Hey, Liverpool did most of their business early in the window. That should give us a leg up over the other clubs."" Well, actually, those clubs did alot of their big business last season, they've had a season to settle them and get them into the club's style and tactics.

WE'RE the ones playing catch up.

As I've said elsewhere, the squandering of last season's opportunity could likely come back to bite us and it is that which worries me.

Had we brought in quality last season, given them a season to settle, we would look a lot better.

It's probably best to do this late at night, idealy a rainy one so the seeds sink into the mud a bit instead of becoming bird food.

null,null,Aesorian,null,null,null,"I've been thinking about goals, and while i's always a risk I've been wondering if another Super Striker is actually nessacary. Just looking at a few other teams and seeing how a lot of their top scoreres are rather close to each other, for example Stoke's top 4 League scorers are seperated by 4 goals, and that could have been top 5 potentially if Bojan (who was in 5th) didn't get injured. I've been thinking about who could score multiple and it really does add up:

Midfielders, Subs &amp; New Players:

    4/5 Goals: Vertout, Gil, Sinclair, Ayew
    3/4 Goals: Gabby
    2/3 Goals: Geuye, Grealish

Total: 23 - 29 Goals

Gil and Sinclair should get more game time, hopefully meaning 4 or 5 goals shouldn't be out of their reach, Vertout and Ayew hopefully succumb to the Sherwood effect and find their shooting boots, again fr the quality they have 4/5 goals shouldnt be TOO much to ask, even if they all come towards the end of the season after they settle in. Gabby should be a super sub, coming off the bench and I'll think he'll nick a couple that way. Finally I think Geuye and Grealish will nick a couple, but they'll put their other roles first (Defesive duties and playmaking respectivly) 

Forwards:

    Kozak &amp; Gestede 10 - 15 between them

Total: 33 - 44 Goals

As they won't be playing every game I can't imagine either of them getting into double figures, however if they can get 6/7 each, as well as a few assists, we'll be laughing.

Then add to them the odd goal from defenders, fringe players or young prospects that we can't rely on to be a constant threat. Say 5 or 6? (Same as last season)

Final Total: 38 - 49 Goals

Which, in theory isn't too bad a haul (1-1.29 goals per game) for a side like ours and is a good starting point for the future.

null,null,dict_disc,null,null,null,"An average investor (like you) should hold a mixture of ""market portfolio"" and ""risk free asset"" (see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model) or [this](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/research/papers/ep3q99_4.pdf) for more details).  

In practice, ""market portfolio"" is index funds that in total, simulate the entire investable market. You can combine different ETFs and funds to simulate the mix, but if you are super lazy, I'd recommend Vanguards Life Strategy 60 Equity, as it's pretty close. ""Risk free asset"" is basically bank accounts, incl. savings account.

You should tune the balance between the two based on your risk profile. What you should not do (and unfortunately the advice is commonly given) is to try to tune this by changing your asset allocations (e.g. ""Hold your age + 10 % bonds"", ""Buy stocks of reputable companies""). This well meaning advice is known to be an inferior approach, but habits die hard...

Anyways, determining the right balance between Market portfolio and Risk free asset is incredibly difficult. Need less to say, you gotta keep enough money for emergencies, but beyond that it's hard. Personally I used some simulations to see the different probability distributions, but at the end of the day, nobody (including top economists) knows what the right parameters are for these simulations. So to a degree it comes back to how mentally tolerant you are towards risk.   

Lastly beware that a LOT of people in finance are trying to extract money out of you (if not all of them). To avoid being cheated, keep this mantra in mind.  

 - Never buy active management, ever
 - Never buy any particular product recommended by any financial people (your bank, broker, even your advisor).

The UN and Security Council were set up after the second world war precisely to prevent wars of aggression, but with a mechanism for authorizing force when there was a genuine reason - such as the Korean war. The US and its allies attempted to get an authorization in this case using that mechanism and failed, but they invaded anyway. Many of the second world war prosecutions were for waging a war of aggression - exactly what happened here.

Surely goes without saying that if you invest in fledgling industries when others aren't that you get a head start?

&gt; he only thing you'd do by charging a lot more for energy is make it less profitable or efficient to do anything in your country.... That stuff will get done.... abroad

It already is. There is far more to deciding to run a business than energy costs. There is no real manufacturing left - our economy is based on services in which energy costs are a minute factor dwarfed by others. 

&gt; Renewables research/production takes a lot of power, a lot of manufacturing... stuff that will be cheaper in a place without as severe fuel/energy costs. They're going to move too.

I really don't know where to start with this. There is nothing to suggest the production of renewable power ""takes a lot of power"". Complete circular logic - a renewable energy business is not going to invest in a country which is not keen on promoting renewable energy - they are far more likely to invest in places where they can grow their business.

&gt; Renewables will not naturally be cheaper than fossil for the foreseeable future, the only way to get fossil to be as expensive as it should be, without pushing businesses that use them abroad, is for all major nations to agree to do it at once

Hydro and onshore wind are already competitive with fossil fuels. There are areas of great potential in the UK such as wave power and sources where we haven't touched the surface like geothermal. Most manufacturing is done in China anyway so none of that is going to be ""pushed abroad"". 

At the end of the day there is no way we are going to convince all nations to do something about this unilaterally.

It's impossible to have a debate about this here because you constantly get people such as yourself who blatantly lie about what is on offer and what is happening.

There is 0 point even carry on discussion on this topic until people in support of the strike accept that basic fact and stop lieing about TFL 'changing everyones hours for 0 compensation'.

**No one will be working extra if they do not want to and they will all get extra money and a raise regardless.**

There is 0 support for RMT's claims about 'work life balance' when they have been offered a raise and a direct opt out yet still refuse.


&gt;Tube drivers are refusing to accept major, unstoppable changes to their working schedules 

""Major and unstoppable"" apart from the direct opt-out and no extra hours being worked?


RMT has two choices: Accept the fact that a night service is happening or accept the fact that the public will support unions being crippled and support their automation. The only thing RMT are achieving is an increase in speed for Tory plans to cripple unions once in for all, all while inconveniencing millions of normal people trying to get to work.


Secondly whats the defence for RMT's strike over the New Hitatchi trains? They've shown time and time again they do not care about the public nor the transport system being up to date or working well, they only care about getting as much pay as possible, and that is why I will never support them and why the public at large are opposed to them. 

Anyone who tries purposefully to slow down upgrades to vital infrastructure and puts millions of ordinary working people in a tough position regularly is not a 'friend of the public', they're an opponent to them.",null,0,null,1438844052,null,null,1438844414,0,cttbpki,null,t3_3fvatl,null,null,null,t1_ctt2jsf,null,null,null,1440312737,null,9,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

The idea wouldn't be to not investigate break ins at odd numbered houses forever; it would be to either get a positive result (which is sounds like they did) and investigate burglaries with a forensics team at no houses, or a negative result in which case they would switch back to the old way of doing things.

&gt;#Aston Villa Review: Episode 125 - Villa sign three more and prepare for AFC Bournemouth
It's been quite a summer at Aston Villa but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Tim Sherwood begins his first full season in charge with a trip to Premier League newcomers AFC Bournemouth, defeated by Villa under Paul Lambert in last season's FA Cup. Something else happened that day; we can't remember what, but the sound of hissing is inescapable.

&gt;In this week's show Chris and Steve look ahead to the game against the Cherries with a mixture of medium-term excitement and short-term trepidation. We also welcome three more signings after Villa snapped up Jose Angel Crespo, Jordan Veretout and Rudy Gestede in addition to Jordan Ayew's confirmation shortly after the last episode.",null,0,null,1438845411,null,null,false,0,cttc45v,null,t3_3fz7s9,null,null,null,t3_3fz7s9,null,null,null,1440312928,null,2,null,avfc,t5_2s569,2,null

I'm hoping for a stable start and picking up the steam a month or two into the league. Also hoping that we're able to stay away from injuries. The only thing that I'm worried about is over-working our starting 11.

**Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**

Hazard. 

But, I would really really like Cesc to be it instead. I feel he can play a much bigger role and have a bigger impact for us to breakthrough the stubborn defenses.

**How do you think the team will line-up?**

null,null,shoestringcycle,null,null,null,"""Filtering"" or ""lane splitting"" is legal, safe and recommended practise if done correctly. It's not only acceptable, but the UK Highway Code explicitly tells drivers to expect it and check mirrors in queues for it.

People who mostly drive or don't know much about life on 2 wheels (whether motorcycle or bicycle) call it weaving, but police, and any other people who know road law and safety call it filtering or lane splitting.

The path isn't blocked if you can safely filter, just like a rider in primary position (center or right of center, called ""taking the lane"") isn't blocking a car if the other lane is clear of oncoming traffic. It's funny how a queue of drivers who couldn't even wait a second to pass you safely and squeeze past you on a bike will suddenly expect you to wait in the queue behind them instead of filtering past (without putting you or them in danger).

It's not too risky, it's quite safe - the only dangers are getting squeezed at a pinch point or oncoming traffic passing a bike or similarly unsafe maneuvres where they cross or come close to the center of the road.

British cycling has a guide to safe filtering here : https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/knowledge/skills/article/izn20130830-Effective-traffic-riding-part-2-0 and this guide is helpful too : http://www.cyclelaw.co.uk/overtaking-and-filtering-whilst-cycling

This is a great example of why we filter on a bike : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8t3tAlBl4I - why get held up because other traffic doesn't have an appropriate vehicle for limited road space at peak times? It's not like any driver will happily queue behind a tractor? Also note how he slows and checks each side road junction, where the biggest risk when filtering is, from drivers ""letting people out"" and nobody checking it's clear (a very frequent cause of accidents, and wholely the fault of drivers, even if riders can anticipate it, the responsibility is fully with the driver to make sure the road is clear before pulling into it)

null,null,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"An interesting point. Given that we know that they quantum lock each other when they see each other, any mating would have to be done without looking. Also, any child rearing would need to be done without looking. The former could be practical. The latter, maybe not so much.  

So, perhaps the Angels do mate in same way that we would understand – perhaps some are male, others female (or equivalent), or perhaps they are hermaphrodite, but still need two (or more) to mate, but go through a phase when they lose their sight whilst in breeding condition (love is blind??), or perhaps the quantum locking thing fades for a while (leaving them vulnerable) during that phase.  

Alternatively, perhaps they do not mate in the way that we would recognize. Perhaps they simply divide parthenogenically. If so, then perhaps this happens with the two halfs forming back to back, so that there is no possibility of them seeing each other. Only when there is a fully formed two-faced, four-armed, four-legged creature do they finally crack apart and go their own ways.  

There are many species on Earth where males produce sperm packets or similar, deposit them somewhere and then lure a female to that spot so that she will locate the sperm packet and use it to fertilise her eggs. Maybe something like that happens. In some Earth species, the males will construct elaborate chambers or other structures to impress the female and so lure her in. I could see that happening with the Angels.  

So, perhaps they are hermaphrodite (as our mythological Angels are often depicted), and are capable of producing both sperm and eggs. Maybe they alternate each role. When an angel is about to produce a sperm packet, perhaps they will create some elaborate gothic-looking sepulchre-like structure to house the sperm packet, and attract another angel to fertilise. Perhaps the “male” angel cocoons themselves in a sealed compartment with the structure and sings a supremely beautiful song to attract the other.  

Once the sperm has been absorbed, the Angels will go they separate ways. The pregnant Angel then lays an egg, again concealed within a tomb or obelisk-like structure for protection, and leaves the young Cherub immediately to fend for itself when its sobs attract some unsuspecting prey to its hatching “tomb” and it bursts out and takes its first meal.  

Grammar Nazi bonus: if *irregardless* were a correctly formed word, it would mean exactly the opposite of what you intend here. Regard**less** [of the feminine appearance of the Angels] contains the negative element that you mean, and is two letters shorter. **Ir**respective also contain the single negative element that you intend, and is a perfectly good alternative. **ir**regard**less**, contains a double negative, reversing that meaning.

null,null,Megaross,,I don't have a bike,null,"It's one of those things that when you do it, it all clicks into place. I struggled to begin with, so did the guy I was learning with.

Keep your head up, go forward a little to get that slow control then lifesafer and look well in from the line, look where you want the bike to end up. Ignore the feelings of ""It's impossible to turn that tight"" or ""No way I'll fall over"" it's 100% possible and you won't provided you keep speed up and don't look at the line, imagine that line is your parents romping or something, you don't want to see it, look where you're going to end up.

Also, if you instructor hasn't explained it, use counterweighting and grip the tank with your knees. It'll increase stability and make you feel more connected to the bike at slow speeds.

Cover the back brake and only use it when you need to, either to slow down or to stop at then end.

Don't forget to breathe, relax, take a deep breath or two before every exercise and think about what you need to do - you have as long as you need so think ""Ok I'm going to start the bike, put it in first, mirrors, lifesafer, revs, clutch control, move forward, lifesaver, look about a metre over from those old people having sex and then turn in counterweighting the bike to pull up to a controlled stop using the back brake"". 

Relax your shoulders and your grip, you'll get a better lifesafer with relaxed shoulders and the more relaxed you are, the more in control.

And don't worry too much, the module 1 isn't as bad as you think it is, I did mine yesterday and I was shaking before I got into the swing of it. In the end I actually enjoyed it - I was so worried about passing it because I thought my riding was hit and miss. But honestly you'll do fine, think positive thoughts!

The surface is lovely, going through the circuit rides is fantastic fun, I'm not the most confident rider and fail or pass I came out with a shiteating grin on my face.

It also means we'll be taking the same approach to the domestic cups, which is even worse since we have a better (or slightly less bad) chance of getting Europe through them than through the competition.

Do we really have to wait and hope they plough millions more into the squad before we can have a go at Europe ?

&gt; I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to put this, I have no idea where on Reddit to ask for advice on this. If this should be somewhere else, then feel free to tell me so I can post it there instead. This is just quite a difficult situation at the moment, and I have no idea what to do, particularly as I do not live in the UK.

&gt; A member of my family (lets call them Dave to make things easier) decided to go on a holiday abroad about a month ago alone. Towards the end of the holiday, Dave decided to move to the United Kingdom permanently and is now living with someone for the time-being, having caught a plane there from the country they were on holiday in. However, Dave decided on this at very short notice, and so will now have to face quite a few problems, which I am hoping some of you will know how to solve.

&gt; Dave is a British citizen by birth and lived there over a decade ago, though does not have a current British passport. Dave has a current passport from a different country (where my family lives) which was used to travel to where they are now. Being in a country where they have not been for a long period of time, there is nobody who I know will be able to be the counter-signatory for Dave's British passport (by the rule of having known Dave for 2 years, and be living in the UK). Is there a way for someone to get a passport, or renew an expired passport, without this step?

&gt; I assume given the circumstances in which Dave arrived in the UK, they are on a Standard Visitor visa. Would Dave be able to get a permanent visa on the grounds of being a citizen and having previously lived there, or are there certain criteria which must be reached for this? This is especially important as with very limited money for the time-being, Dave will be unable to work on their current visa, and so staying without money or a job will be very difficult.

&gt; *Dave does not have any important personal documents besides the passport. This includes the expired British passport, birth certificate, citizenship certificate (Dave is a dual citizen), medical records etc. Is there any reliable way to get these to the UK? I have no idea how risky posting these would be.

&gt; I hope this works out, but there are a lot of obstacles and I am not hopeful that Dave will be able to stay in the country for longer than the 6 months granted on the Standard Visitor visa, despite their wishes to stay permanently.

null,null,penurious,null,null,null,"You're right, I would say investment in infrastructure is largely associated with Keynesian economics though. 

I also disagree that it's a bad idea.  We've seen qe can work when its done right, I think a central investment bank is a good idea.  As for the inflationary effects and the banks independence the guardian article sums it up:

&gt; What about longer­-term inflationary effects? It is difficult to see why printing money on a far smaller scale than under QE should have a pernicious effect on inflation if the much larger costs associated with QE have failed to do so. If there is a sustained recovery in demand, the Bank can simply raise interest rates as per the inflation target. If the Bank ever runs out of the assets it needs to do this, the government can commit to provide them in much the same way as it has already done for potential QE losses. A government that would renege on this commitment and allow inflation is also a government that would abolish the independence of the Bank to achieve that aim.

&gt; The last significant innovation in the Bank of England’s history was operational independence and the inflation­-targeting mandate. Economic times have changed. Inflation credibility is no longer the only priority. The current economic plan is to rely on the Bank while hoping nothing goes wrong. Yet fundamental weaknesses in the tools of monetary policy have been revealed by the financial crisis and yet we keep asking the monetary authority to do more, not less.

I answered that while I didn't think it was the case, any teams system should be comprehendable in a fairly short period of time, i.e. whats is expected of the position a player is to play for the club. Obviously a system should have complexity, which will take far longer to master, but a basic understading should come fairly quick since, in the end, its just football. IIRC Daniel Sturridge played in the FA a couple of days after we signed him, albeit it was against a shit opponent. In the end football is simple, and a set system and your players understanding of it is what wins you championships, but its not like if we signed Messi and played him against Stoke, he'd be shit because he didn't know our system, he'd be good because he is a good football player. 

Firmino probably arent even gonna see a whole lot of differences, its not like we're asking a pilot to do surgery, we're asking a footballer to play football, albeit a new/different style. A question was asked and I answered, thats why I posted, it wasn't even my assumption. I wasn't Rydleos either btw. If I had wanted to comment on the assumption itself, I would have replied to --YNWA--, not further down the thread where a question was posted. 

I then commented on the state of the sub, because I found it troubling that these events led to massive down voting:

Rydleo asked why Coutinho was more fit. Its a fair question since, despite his massive improvement, Coutinho had a long time where he couldnt even finish a game in the Premier League. --YNWA-- then speculated that ""fit"" might have meant that Firmino wasn't tactically prepared to BRs system, to which Rydleo commented the perfectly logical issue, that if our system is so complex that Firmino, who was bought specifically for the purpose, cannot learn the basics to a level where he CAN feature in our starting eleven, then there is a massive issue regarding our system. 

Whether Firmino SHOULD feature, with Lallana and Ibes strong pre-seasons and the depth that provides, with a long season ahead of us, with Firmino not being on the same level as Lallana/Ibe in regards to feeling comfortable in our system, is a whole different dilemma. 

That question had nothing to do with the fact, that a poster getting down voted for a posted response on our system being so complex that a professional footballer cannot learn it in a reasonable time, regardless of whether the sentiment has any truth, still speaks to the, at times, state of this subreddit. I'm sure Rydleo hasn't been sent into a deep depression by the down votes, but that sort of attitude will hurt the subreddit longterm if posters gets down voted for going against the norm.",null,0,null,1438850495,null,null,false,0,cttdfwh,null,t3_3fxgik,null,null,null,t1_cttb1hk,null,null,null,1440313553,null,-1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-1,null

Only if the entry level positions are below 22k (and that there are so few transferrable skills that an entry level position is all you can get).

&gt; I've seen lots of companies soul search about high staff turnover. Wages are almost never brought up

And in these companies, if all the workers would remain with the pay kept low, would the management increase the salaries? I doubt it. Where's the incentive to raise the wage?

High staff turnover implies they're getting new people in. If people are still applying for the job at a low salary, it's unlikely to be the salary that's the main problem. Finding it very hard to recruit at a low salary is definitely a good way of getting a company to increase the pay.",null,0,null,1438851062,null,null,false,0,cttdktv,null,t3_3fvatl,null,null,null,t1_ctsk4dx,null,null,null,1440313618,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It's a very common strategy when dumping a huge amount of stock. The mere act of dumping the stock on the open market puts downwards pressure (increased supply, same demand) on the price anyway. Then there's trading fees to think about. 

A 2% discount isn't absurd at all. I'd say it's about right, all things considered.

Guardian writers’ predicted position: 6th (NB: this is not necessarily David Hytner’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)

Last season’s position: 5th

Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 100-1

The tweet from the Tottenham Hotspur account carried the hint of satisfaction. “We are delighted to announce that we have nothing else to announce today,” it read. “Have a great evening.”

The eighth of July was, indeed, a big day for the club. It had begun with the confirmation of the signing of Toby Alderweireld from Atlético Madrid for £11.4m – a move to underline the recalibration in defence Mauricio Pochettino had wanted.


There were times during Pochettino’s debut season at the helm when the team looked horribly shaky at the back. Any manager, let alone one who played at centre-half for Argentina, would be unhappy with a record of 53 goals against in 38 league fixtures. Only four sides conceded more in the Premier League last time out.

Alderweireld, however, was merely the hors d’oeuvre. With a very large drum roll, the chairman, Daniel Levy, detailed the updated plans for the club’s new £400m stadium, which will be built adjacent to the existing White Hart Lane site.

It was revealed that Levy had cut a deal with the NFL to stage at least two American football matches every season for 10 years at the ground, which will feature a snazzy retractable pitch. Underneath the grass will be an artificial surface that will be used for the American football and other enterprises, such as concerts.

The headline item, undoubtedly, was the detail that the architect, Populous, had finessed the original design by KSS architects as part of what is known as the peer review process, to bump up the projected capacity from 56,250 to 61,000.

When Levy first commissioned the plans for the new stadium in 2007, there was talk at KSS and BuroHappold, the structural engineering firm who were engaged and remain on the job, that his most urgent, single requirement was a capacity of 60,001. In other words, one seat bigger than Arsenal’s new-build Emirates Stadium.

Levy has also been consumed by creating the ultimate match-day experience, with seats as close to the pitch as possible and, as KSS made their design tighter, so the capacity was reined in at 56,250. Populous, though, have tweaked and squeezed on the same stadium footprint and, with a clutch of alterations – most notably, the decision to remove all club and corporate seats from the ends behind the goals – they have succeeded in getting up to 61,000, subject to planning permission. The club will put in again for this in the autumn.

The stadium has become Levy’s obsession. It has been on his mind since 2001, when he first came into the club and the journey to get this far has been fraught. Levy has seen Arsenal plan, construct and spend nine seasons at the Emirates and, more recently, West Ham United receive the golden egg that is the Olympic Stadium.

It is fair to say that Levy has played the long game but, after all of the soap opera twists and turns, he can now look forward to Tottenham luxuriating in the biggest club venue in London. They already have the plushest training ground, which opened in 2012, and it can be said that Tottenham’s longer-term future looks both secure and extremely exciting.

Here is the thing, however. Tottenham will not move into the stadium until 2018-19, by which time they will have spent the previous season playing their matches at a temporary home, most likely Milton Keynes’ Stadiummk – they have said to Tottenham that they would be happy to accommodate them. Tottenham’s preference would be to remain in London, ideally at Wembley, but, essentially, no one wants them in the capital because of problems related to policing, rivalries and capacity.

Therefore, Tottenham find themselves in familiar territory – in a state of transition, putting down the building blocks for what they hope will be a glorious future but with the need to show patience and confronted by various issues in the here and now.

By any barometer, Pochettino’s first season had to be considered as a success. He led the team to a fifth-placed finish in the league and the Capital One Cup final, which they lost 2-0 to Chelsea, while overseeing changes to the playing style and restructuring behind the scenes. Paul Mitchell was taken from Southampton, Pochettino’s previous club, to be the head of recruitment and there was major surgery to the scouting department. Rob Mackenzie arrived from Leicester City to be Mitchell’s No2.

The season’s high points were the home wins over Arsenal and Chelsea and, more generally, there were improvements in conditioning and injury prevention. There was also the heartening faith in the club’s home-grown players and, in Harry Kane, who emerged to sensational effect, there was one of the feel-good stories of the season.

The Holy Grail of a Champions League finish always looked beyond them, though, particularly as they were sapped by their Europa League commitments and no one can say with any certainty that it now looks closer – and not only because they face what Pochettino will say is another unwanted Europa League campaign. Tottenham fans have watched with trepidation as their top-four rivals have strengthened on the transfer market.

The biggest worry for them at the time of writing concerns Pochettino’s options up front. With Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado being shuffled towards the exit – neither has played any part in pre-season – Kane is the lone senior striker at the manager’s disposal, although Pochettino does say that Soldado remains a part of his plans. Kane is a player who has only just turned 22 and has six months of experience as a Premier League regular to his name, albeit a wonderful six months. He cannot be expected to shoulder the responsibility alone.

There has been skulduggery behind the scenes regarding Kane, with agents manoeuvring to lure him into signing with them. Football can be a murky business. There has been a link to Manchester United and Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman at Old Trafford, would surely love to have him.

The good news for Tottenham, however, is that Kane is interested only in the season ahead with them. He knows that after his 31-goal heroics last time out he will be a marked man and his focus is simply on maintaining his levels and avoiding any second-season dip.

The back-up will arrive and Tottenham are exploring their options, with Javier Hernández, Saido Berahino and Timo Werner among those on the wanted list. When Pochettino spoke towards the end of last season of the need to be “smarter and quicker than our rivals in the summer market,” he cannot have had this in mind.

The club have, at least, moved swiftly on their defensive targets, with Alderweireld, who was snatched from the clutches of Southampton, where he spent last season on loan, following the signings of Kevin Wimmer and Kieran Trippier.

Alderweireld will partner his Belgium team-mate Jan Vertonghen in central defence, with the curiosity being that the pair occupy the full-back positions for their national team – Alderweireld on the right; Vertonghen the left. There is the belief at Tottenham that the Belgians ought to be the perfect partnership, although that, obviously, remains to be seen.

Wimmer, a £4.3m arrival from FC Köln, will provide sturdy back-up in the middle, while Trippier will compete with Kyle Walker for the right-back slot. Trippier, who impressed for Burnley last season, looks to be a bargain at £3.5m but Walker is expected to start as the first choice. Eric Dier, a Pochettino favourite – partly because of the manner in which he stood up to Chelsea’s Diego Costa in the Capital One Cup final – offers another option in central defence, while he has also been tried in defensive midfield during pre-season.

It is clear that Tottenham have to add further before the closure of the transfer window, with one or two strikers and another option in wide midfield essential. A commanding central midfielder would not go amiss either. Arguably the priority will be to ensure that the goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, remains at the club.

The France captain excelled again last season and it has reached the point where he makes a couple of jaw-dropping saves in every game as a matter of course. He is fed up at the lack of Champions League football at Tottenham, however, and he wants to move to a club that will play at the elite level.

Intrigue clings to Lloris’s situation in that, when he signed a new five-year contract last July to replace the one that would expire in 2016, he made it clear to Levy that he would want to consider his options if the club did not qualify for the Champions League. Two weeks after Lloris had re-signed, Tottenham bought Michel Vorm, who was Holland’s third-choice goalkeeper at the World Cup.

To Lloris’s mind, he had a gentleman’s agreement with Levy that he would be allowed to leave, for a sensible price, should Tottenham fail to reach the Champions League. Tottenham contest this version; they maintain he is not for sale and one simple thought occurs – why on earth did Lloris not get it in writing, particularly when he was committing until 2020? Dimitar Berbatov and Luka Modric are among those who will tell you verbal arrangements with Levy are not always binding.

Lloris would be a target for Manchester United, in the event that they lost David De Gea to Real Madrid, while he has endured the added complication of the freakish wrist injury he suffered on his holidays at the end of June. It is a little mysterious, with Pochettino saying only that it happened “close to the swimming pool”. Lloris has completed all of the conditioning work in pre-season and he made a surprise return as a substitute against Milan on Wednesday evening in the Audi Cup. It appears he could be ready for the opening fixture on Saturday, which is against United at Old Trafford.

Tottenham have shed plenty of their unwanted players – Younès Kaboul, Vlad Chiriches, Etienne Capoue, Benjamin Stambouli, Paulinho, Lewis Holtby – and more will follow, including the winger, Aaron Lennon. He has been banished to train with the under-21s and it should be said Pochettino is ruthless when he feels a player’s face no longer fits.

It has been noticeable how the profile of signings has changed since Pochettino came to the club. Young, ideally British, talents with potential resale value have been made a priority and few Tottenham managers have shown themselves to be as committed to the club’s youth system products as Pochettino.

He gave Ryan Mason his breakthrough and he had four academy players in the lineup for the Capital One Cup final – Kane, Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Andros Townsend – plus Danny Rose, who started out at Leeds United’s academy before moving to Tottenham’s at 17.

Pochettino trains every week with a handful of academy players in the first-team group and there are hopes the midfielders Harry Winks and Josh Onomah will be the next to establish themselves. There is also excitement around the 17-year-old centre-half, Cameron Carter-Vickers.

It will be interesting to see whether the attacking midfielder, Alex Pritchard, can make an impact, after his fine season on loan at Brentford – he has not played in pre-season because of injury – and, ditto, Dele Alli, the 19-year-old midfielder, who was signed from MK Dons in January for £5m before being loaned back for the remainder of the season. Alli looked promising against Real Madrid in the Audi Cup on Tuesday.

The questions are numerous. Can Christian Eriksen and Bentaleb continue to improve? Is there is sufficient leadership in the team? Will Erik Lamela become less frustrating and more decisive? Much, however, will depend on how the club exit the transfer window.",null,0,null,1438852221,null,null,false,0,cttduud,null,t3_3fzbnx,null,null,null,t1_cttdun8,null,null,null,1440313748,null,4,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,4,null

The bigger issue is that we didn't score goals and lost or drew games as a result, not because we conceded the odd goal. We've added more goals and key passes to the team, so if the tactics help these players carry on their stats from the last year or two then we should be in for a very decent return this year.

The current system allows rich parents to pay tuition fees of their kids  directly, thereby potentially meaning they would pay less than a poor student as the rich family can avoid interest whereas the poor student cannot.

Also, with the current system, there is a point where, the more you earn, the *less* you pay back overall as you get to a point where you earn so much money that you can pay back the loan in less than 25 years, thereby incurring less interest on the loan.

Thirdly, there are students out there that are choosing not to go for a £9000 course in lieu of a £6000 course, even though there is a good chance they would may pay the same amount of money back.

A graduate tax would get rid of all the above problems with the current system. It just has to be implemented right. Anything worse than the current 9% of anything over £21,000 will be an immediate detriment to any student. I would like to think that the Labour party would not try to pull the wool over anyone's eyes by trying anything like that, but then I remember Mr Miliband's non-offer of reducing fees to £6000, which despite looking like it helps the poor, would have been actually regressive, helping no-one but the most wealthiest graduates to pay back their debts whilst being of no help at all to the poorest graduates.",null,0,null,1438852823,null,null,false,0,ctte04g,null,t3_3fxkb2,null,null,null,t1_cttdjjj,null,null,null,1440313818,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

British pilots are amongst the best in the world. RAF training is valued highly, and places like RAF Valley provide some superb training for pilots from around the world. So, your pilots are not shit.

Indian Sukhoi pilots are the best of their best. They train intensively, have the most flight hours amongst all pilots in the IAF (not surprising since the Su has an endurance of 12 hours with in-flight refuelling).

The Sukhoi is marginally better than the Eurofighter for pure dogfights. In an exercise, the Sukhoi can turn a bit faster AND has two pairs of eyes in the cockpit which is incredibly useful for the marginal disadvantage of being larger and easier to spot. 

So, this report is either 1) Wrong/highly exaggerated or 2) Lacking context (environment, restrictions, rules).

The RAF uses the Typhoon in a way that will reduce the need for raw dogfight skills; if an aircraft does end up in combat having to dogfight, other variables like fuel state, the territory over which you're fighting, balance of numbers and what weapons either guy(s) has/have left will decide the fight more than how many more degrees you can turn per second over your opponent.

null,null,rytlejon,lfc68,,null,"Well, you're correct in a way. But that way of thinking of players is quite damaging. A player is first and foremost a football player with certain attributes. They can be played wherever on the pitch and do either well or bad depending on how their attributes are matching the demands of the certain position. But the demands of each position on the pitch differ between teams, between formations and styles of play.

Now, when we say that Joe Gomez *is* a centre back, what we mean is actually that he's mostly played at centre back. But at Liverpool, for example, there is the argument that playing at centre back demands certain experience that the same position doesn't demand at Charlton. 

But Joe Gomez *is* a good defender - he's also quite fast and quite strong. Those three attributes could make him a good fullback but also a good centre back. But his experience at the highest level isn't enough for him to play centre back for us. It is enough to play fullback though, which is a more forgiving position for inexperienced players. Therefor, you could say that currently he *is* a fullback, who might *become* a centre back. 

I'm not trying to sound condescending by making this ELI5, my point is just that I think people exaggerate the extent to which a player ""is"" or ""isn't"" a certain position.",null,0,null,1438853592,null,null,false,0,ctte6ps,null,t3_3furl2,null,null,null,t1_ctsewtx,null,null,null,1440313904,null,2,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

&gt;I Davessume given the circumstDavences in which Dave Daverrived in the UK, they Davere on Dave StDavendDaverd Visitor visDave.

If the parades insist on marching down 'traditional routes' (read: contentious areas) then they absolutely should pay for the policing of those.

Ultimately the priority of your emergency fund is to be easily accessible and not to hedge against inflation. However if you can do both at the same time without compromising the available of the cash then why not?

I would imagine that most regular contributors on here keep the easiest to access cash portion of their emergency fund in an [interest bearing current account](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts#interest) or perhaps [an account with other benefits](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts#perks).

Also just to add the previous poster - small amounts of cash in a bank are virtually risk free in that they are held safe. This is certainly the case up to £85,000 per institution due to government protection but tends to hold for larger sums as well (banks are *relatively* safe compared to the markets).

However they will *never* grow significantly and will probably in fact shrink due to inflation (especially when in higher amounts that are generally not covered by the more generous interest bearing accounts).

The logic that attempts to show that all Muslims should apologise for poorly-behaved members of their religion is the same logic that attempts to show that all white people should apologise for poorly-behaved members of their skin colour.  

The logic is ""All members of group X should apologise for poorly-behaved members of that group regardless of whether they approve, disapprove, or have aided or abetted them"".  
  
Taken to its extreme this is akin to asking me to apologise for Stalin's purges because I've got a moustache.  
  
But I have no intention of apologising for Stalin: I had nothing to do with what he did. Similarly white people in general shouldn't be asked to apologise for Jimmy Saville, and Muslims in general shouldn't be apologising for terrorists.

A few people have replied and talked about productivity and profit and I've been sitting here thinking ""well there isn't a profit with what we do"" (apart from the education of the next generation).  A few months back my work mate and I were chatting about what would make things better for the college. We were mulling over what we would do if WE were management to deal with budget cuts, improve efficiency and improve staff morale and there were a whole host of things that would save time and money.  But no one asks us so we don't offer our ideas.  

The whole public sector must be like this.  Think of the money wasted and the opportunities missed when the workforce feels taken advantage of.  You know the scene in Alien where the engineers discuss how long it will take to repair the ship? ""Tell them it will take 24 hours"", ""It will take 48 hours"". Or the scene where Ripley tries to talk to them in the engine room and they've turned the valves to make it look more broken than it is?  I've seen things like this happen!   Everyone just wants an easy life and to do as little as possible for the salary they get.

A bailout is effectively a lifeline in circumstances where the one awarding the bailout has their hands tied. It's a life saver intended to prevent consequences that the one bailing out will also suffer. There is relatively little choice; it is done out of necessity, not motivated primarily, if at all, by future gains. 

And investment is a planned and calculated time or effort put in with the explicit aim that you hope to benefit or profit from what you put in. There is specific choice in choosing to bear risk with the expectation of positive gains on top.

You really think that at the time of the crisis they were thinking, ""Hmm, we could bail out RBS but our returns on XYZ bank would be higher... Screw it, let RBS (one of the largest) fail -- it doesn't matter we'd get a better return elsewhere...""

It also just doesn't make sense. People hate banks. Now suddenly they want a bank to have an *even greater role* simply because it is managed by the government who promises to do ""good""? An institution by no means guaranteed not to screw it all up given recent memory? 

Regulators/experts didn't even understand the risks of what they were doing in the run up the crash, and still disagree as to some of the main causes! We'd be trusting politicians (who you may not have voted for yourself!) to not use it in their interests, not throw money into projects to keep them going even if they are looking like they will fail (because it will make them look bad to pull the plug); I think aside from the theoretical economic pros/cons there are also significant social ones as well.

As someone who runs a community organisation I was lucky enough to attend an extensive Q&amp;A on the topic so we would be able to assess the impact of cuts on our activities. 

What *you've* clearly misunderstood is what I've initially said and the proportion of money returned to councils from central government.

Your hypothesis is that the money returned to councils from central government is equivalent to 25% of local council tax revenue multiplied by three - therefore council spending is equivalent to 100% of local CT revenue. It isn't. In 2013 the total returned to councils from government was almost £10 billion lower than the total CT revenue.

In any case the issue I was highlighting is that you don't, in the main, fund local services directly whereas most people think they do. Even taking into account the Policing precept, which, in the few places it applies, is an insignificant proportion of funding.

The current narrative around public services is the idea that some people haven't paid into the system, or haven't paid enough into the system to 'deserve' what they get back. The reality is that no one pays into the system - it is basically bankrupt - Osborne's problem during the last Parliament was that tax receipts are not growing because the new jobs in the economy are all at the bottom end. At the middle/top end we lost 50,000 jobs during July alone.

The average pension pot is £22,000 the average cost of elder care in my part of the country is £106,000 a year. So even if you fall into the 'worked all their lives' category you're still drawing far more from the system than you could have put in.

HOWEVER if you were on a repayment mortgage and the payments are £478 a month then you'd have to find £28 a month from elsewhere to pay the mortgage because they'd still want their £50 so there'd be a shortfall. Not only that, because only the interest portion is tax deductible, ~ £250 a month in the first year, there's tax to pay on the £228 difference so that's another £55 a month you're going to need to find from elsewhere to pay the tax bill.

My criticism of him is this: he talks about depressed demand and there being a big output gap (the justification for a large QE stimulus not having a significant inflationary effect) without actually referring to the output gap: estimated by the Bank of England at &lt;1% of GDP. If so, then there is a lot of less leeway for a QE stimulus (to do so in the first place would require removing the Bank of England's independence as well).

As far as productivity goes, like Corbyn he claims that increased business investment is the silver bullet for increasing productivity and that declining investment in the UK is the cause for low productivity over the past five years. However, he doesn't exactly present any evidence for this. A cross-comparison of the countries we have lost against in the past few years in terms of productivity and a correlation between us being the only country cutting investment for example, though I somehow doubt that that's the case. 

Of course, there is a second explanation for Britain's productivity puzzle (or at least for a significant portion of it) which is that with companies have switched more staff to part-time roles and reduced hours worked per member of staff. This would also fit in with two of his graphs better than his own hypothesis: Britain's relatively high underemployment rate and the fact that our productivity gap with other countries was closing 1991-2007 and has only started rising since them.

For example; who would win in a fight between a guy with a modern sniper rifle, and an old AK47?

At long range, the guy with the modern sniper rifle has the advantage, at medium range its more balanced, but at close range it’s got to go to the guy with the old assault rifle.

If India were unexpectedly attacked by Pakistan, by the time their squadrons were scrambled and airborne, those PAF jets would be right on top of them. Likewise if the threat came with China, so India trains and equips its air-superiority fighters *specifically* for close-range combat.

If Russia were to attack us with the same old fighters, we’d have hours of warning from the various early-warning stations we have around Europe, and the installations we have in the UK which point out over the north sea. The combat would occur at a distance. 

The Indians use things like close-range infrared targeting specifically to give them an advantage in that sort of close-in combat. We rely on powerful ECM’s and stealth materials (all Euro fighters of that generation have it to some degree) to engage the enemy beyond their effective distance of detecting us.

But the reality is that air-to-air combat is so unlikely a threat to us, we don’t need to maintain the capability too seriously. What we need is effective ground-attack aircraft, and to replace our aging Tornados with a more capable aircraft.

Kelly's Cellar's - Nice and small traditional pub, great atmosphere in there no matter time you go. 

McHughs - Supposedly the oldest building in Belfast. In any case it's another great traditional pub, pretty close to the docks/Titanic museum. 

Whites Tavern - Even though McHughs is meant to be the oldest surving building it Belfast, Whites dates back to 1630 and claims to be the oldest pub. It's a nice spot, but can be a bit empty at times. Still worth getting a pint. 

Crown is fine as someone said, bit touristy but still a good one to go see. You need to head down to the cathedral quarter too, that's where a lot of good ones are, like the Duke of York and the Harp Bar (Bit dear, but always very lively and they are nice victorian style pubs). 

For a more modern, relaxed type of place I like Black Box (Depends how old yous are, it's a bit studenty I guess) because you can get tea, coffee etc. too and it is cheap.

The Empire is another great one, particularly if you want live music. If you are there on a Thursday, Rab McCullough's Blues band is on and it's a brilliant night. Empire is up on Botanic in the Queens Quarter (Which is where botanic gardens and the museum are), Queens University itself is probably worth a poke about too. 

There are lots of things to do and it depends how much time you have got/your interests, but I will also suggest visiting the Linen Hall Library (It's the oldest in Belfast, founded in 1788). It's very nice.

The North Coast is great, so if you visit the Giants Causeway (Which is a must really!) then there is lots to see up there. I second the Bushmills suggestion, it's a good tour. 

Finally, I've never done it myself but I know people who have visited Belfast and said they really enjoyed the black taxi tour. It's meant to be a great way to get to know the city.

They think differently to you, and I think differently to you and they. 

Your false equivalence between marching and political protest is just that. There need be no comparison or mental gynastics. 

The right to freedom of assembly and association is linked to so many events that - with enough people - you can basically say just about anything is cultural. People can and do slap ""culture"" on anything, that is how culture exists. Who decides ""culture""? The majority or the powerful? How well has that worked in NI?

I find it actually quite scary when people say things like ""the assertion that marching is a human right needs to be challenged"". 

Certainly challenge it, laws are supposed to be challenged - but don't perform your own mental gymnastics where *I* have to agree with *you* that your false comparision is somehow valid when it is not. 

Also; if this is something that is removed from the public purse, say that the OO forks out [X amount] for next years 12th of July parade in Belfast alone, to the police, privately. But they say they'd give them [X.1 amount] if there were no restrictions placed on the route.... [X.5] if they can have all the paramilitary trappings. What happens then? It's a private transaction between the police and the OO, so why involve the Parades Commission? Why involve community groups, why listen to SF MLAs bitch and moan about the route going through ""their"" area. Sing what you want, where you want and do what you want... It's all been paid for lads. Go nuts one and all.  

It's just public highway after all, everyone and no one owns it all at the same time. And the OO are ""paying to play"" so to speak. 

Are the protesters who have a right to protest against the events to pay to protest the very thing they disagree with? It would be unfair to make someone pay for a thing and not make someone pay for the anti-thing. 

Shit like this stays in the public realm for the simple reason that you can't please all the people all the time. Allowing it to become private would not only be a human rights abuse, lip service to the idea of democracy, but marching would be even more open to corruption and abuse.

1) It creates clients for the Labour party, which I suppose is good for them, but it's unfair to people not lucky (or badly-behaved) enough to get a council house or to be the children of people who get one.

2) It wastes a source of public revenue free from deadweight loss, and

3) It subsidizes the luxury of the rich by paying the rent of their servants (food industry workers, retail workers, cleaners) so that they can live near them while still receiving wages only sufficient for marginal areas.

If you are against giving someone £100,000 pounds worth of housing in one go, why would you be for giving them considerably more in sub-market rent over, say 25 years of tenancy? The only reason I can think of is that the Labour party thinks that the council tenant will be their client and the Tory party thinks that the new owner will be theirs. Both positions are bad in the same way.

The perverse incentive of ""Pay to Stay"" can be got rid of by not subsidizing low earners to live in expensive areas in the first place.

Rent control: ambivalent. We had this for about 74 years in the 20th century, and it was a big part of making home-ownership a mass phenomenon. It does expropriate the landlord, but buying housing to let is a political speculation anyway, so I don't care.

Land value tax: good, but it should be on all land, not just unused land. It is an excellent source of public revenue.

Planning laws: we need to build on greenfield sites. Not doing so is rank cowardice.

Environmental standards: fine, although I think there should be exceptions for experimental self-builds.

We replaced Sterling with the Bundesliga's best chance creator in the last two seasons (cumulatively).

Gerrard is influential no doubt. We suffered somewhat when we lost Carra, but went on to have the brilliant 13/14 season. A slightly younger Carra in that side, and we might have won the title. 

I would also not worry about penalties right now; we need to win them first.

I understand your pessimism, but we'll have to see how well or badly it pans out. Rule of thumb says that 50% of signings work out very well within a season or two - if half of Benteke, Milner, Firmino, Origi, Gomez, Clyne and Ings do so, I think we'll be very pleased. The positives are there.

EDIT: Everyone said we would fail horribly when we lost Hyypia, Owen, McManaman, Alonso, Masch, Torres, etc. and we somehow manage to stay in contention.

null,null,whateverspots,eng-GreaterLondon,East London,null,"&gt; I think a lot of these firms have the stipulation if you get accepted into their graduate schemes, you get sacked if you don't pass within a reasonable timeframe.
&gt; 

This is where these firms are really smart - they never clearly stipulate this. The contracts are SO cleverly written. There are no ""X fails and you're out"", there's no structure of mandatory exam passes, resit schedules, etc. Nothing. It's pretty much decided on a case-by-case basis, and the contract eludes to this but also eludes to some criteria they use to assess you (so things like effort and additional help being sought, etc, your peer &amp; top down evaluations, etc). Because they've written very little - there's very little for people to fight back against.

I quit a 'good' accountancy scheme 9 months in, I have a first class degree from a top 10 redbrick in Economics so I'm more than capable in theory, but I just couldn't do it (rambles at the bottom). In my 9 months I saw so many lovely, keen &amp; intelligent people get fired for exam fails. This includes a first in politics from Cambridge, business degrees, finance degrees, biology degrees...IMO a lot of it boils down to them over-recruiting (so they can proudly announce to competitors that they had the best financial year ever - recruiting 300 new grads nationwide). They openly admit in all training and recruitment that these (LBR - highly disposable &amp; totally exploitable) grads account for the bulk of their employees. Most leave after qual to join the ranks of humanity again - there are very few managers, very few partners who actually guide the process. The bulk of it is just grunt work man power. When they need their grads to count shitty NHS mattresses for stock check, if you fail you're probably pretty safe. If they have 10 grads (charged to clients at ~£140 an hour) sat in their office 'clearing up' the archive rooms, they'll happily get rid. It's a cost cutting exercise disguised as 'high academic standards'. 

And ultimately that is a total ruse. Studying for those exams is intense, you have to give up all semblance of a social life and just work/study/work/study/work/study for weeks at a time. With limited support, a fucking horribly bitchy work environment &amp; no time to relax and take a break from it all. It was so utterly miserable, we were all so fucking sad, we had people committing ""exam suicide"" just so they'd be released from their training contract without having to pay back costs of training.

When looking at a group of grads there are so many more variables that should be considered than ""is she smart enough, did she study hard enough"". Stupidly small things like living at home vs renting away make a huge difference - as cooking/cleaning became a chore that ate into my study time. Noisy housemates who can't understand, a longer commute if you're living w parents outside of LDN, not having enough space to lay your study notes out cos you're living in a tiny bedsit in SE London, etc. Things like is grad X office bound so can chill and even sneak some extra study time in vs grad Y is being asked to travel to 3 offices a day so doesn't have time and gets home shattered. Even personal issues like having an unshakeable cold 2 weeks before your exam, newly born children, bereavements, moving house interrupt the work/study cycle that's required to pass.  Even issues with getting to exams - some grads were made to travel to ridiculous exam centres and would get up at 5am vs those who were local and got up at 8. Like it's clearly engineered to squeeze the most out of ppl in the smallest possible time, maybe that intensity is engineered to get us weeklings out of the game, but it really should never be labelled as an issue of intellect. Firms know that good grads go all the time, it's all circumstantial. 

Sorry I've written an essay here - IDK I really fucking hate these schemes and would encourage anyone considering applying to read as much as possible online. I read some bad reviews and didn't want to believe them because it was so exciting, and I had a job before even finishing my degree, etc etc. It was just awful.",null,0,null,1438865222,null,null,1438865801,0,ctthpy1,null,t3_3fzf6f,null,null,null,t1_cttfsm4,null,null,null,1440315634,null,27,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27,null

null,null,welshieeeee,null,null,null,"In many industries they are deemed worthless unless you use them to your advantage. A lot of people obtain a degree but do not keep a record of what they did during that degree, no portfolio and just think the degree title along with institution name on their CV is enough to land them a job. In today's globalised world a lot of people will just laugh at you, especially in the IT and Finance area where a lot of top bosses are becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of true applicable raw skills graduates have coming out of university.

I sat down for an interview with a large multinational technology firm and the interviewer had obviously had a bad day interviewing graduates. I walked in, did all the usual formal things and then sat down as instructed. What came next I wasn't prepared for at all. I will admit it took me aback quite a bit and was the moment I realised I was firmly in the real world and a small fish in a rather large pond full of sharks.

The guy looked at me and said, 'If you're another graduate who thinks he knows it all because they've spent 3 or 4 years at university then you may as well get up and go now. If you're someone that appreciates that the only part of your degree I give a shit about is the time you spent actually using technologies and developing your skills on a technological and personal level, then feel free to stay sat down and we will continue on'. I just sat there for one moment and then said that I'd like to continue on.

The interview went well and I ended up getting the job. He asked me later why I stayed there and didn't walk out and I said to him its because deep down I agree with him, even as someone straight out of university. I said to him that's why I built up a large portfolio on Github and Codepen and printed off my assignments I did during university to put into a folder to take with me to interviews so they could see the reports I'd written up in relation to that work. He was impressed with that and said only I and one other candidate did that. We were the two candidates who got the jobs on offer.

If I and that other candidate, who so happens now to be one of my best mates, hadn't used our own initiative, in that instance our degree alone would have been absolutely pointless. We'd have been sent to the scrapheap along with all the other graduates. The reality is having a degree on paper is only a small step through Human Resources but anyone with a brain knows that the recruitment process doesn't end there. Being able to put my folder down in front of the guy and talk about my work and projects confidently is what landed me the job, made me come off confident and made him believe that I knew what I was on about. The fact is, there are far too many people in todays world who think a degree is the be all and end all.

Furthermore, I know of more and more companies that are poaching talented young adults straight out of colleges/school and training them in-house through their schemes than employing graduates because (a) it is often cheaper long term and (b) it also means you train them up to do exactly what you need them to do.

In conclusion, I believe that the number of universities and places should be slashed dramatically, and I'd rather see a feeder system in place whereby school leavers get subsidised in-house training with companies they've approached themselves to work for. The money would be better spent all round. For example, I'd apply for a 3 year training contract at PwC and then if they accept my application the government pays PwC to train me in-house. Depending on demand what you might see then is companies like PwC actually creating their own schools of excellence that teach the RIGHT skills to capitalise on (a) the number of applicants and (b) the subsidies from governments.",null,0,null,1438865565,null,null,1438866159,0,ctthv96,null,t3_3fzf6f,null,null,null,t1_ctth1mt,null,null,null,1440315705,null,6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

Arsenal are in fantastic shape but still lacking that clinical striker. Chelsea are too but over-reliant on Costa, whose thigh is becoming a Sturridge-level issue. City are a question-mark - they have added Sterling but now have to rely only on Bony for goals should Aguero be injured.

The slightest questioning of Corbyn results in torrents of downvotes and accusations of ""NOT REAL LABOUR"" + yelling incoherently about Neoliberalism.

Most people are not opposed to Corbyn because of his economic policies (although im skeptical of some of his proposals, which despite my attempts to make repeatedly clear that I agree with him on some stuff, im still branded a Thatcherite), we're opposed to him because he has some seriously insane and unpopular ideas regarding foreign policy. I care not one iota for anti-austerity or pro-austerity at this point, by 2020 the austerity thing is going to be a dead-in-the-water issue since we'll be well out of the crisis. The issue is I dont want some nutter dismantling vital defense systems like Trident (something none of the public wants), leaving NATO (this is completely fucking insane, and NATO was a Labour achievement done under fucking Attlee, so dont pull the 'not real Labour' shite on me) or trying to sanction Israel while funneling support to Hamas. I also dont like Corbyn's affinity for Iran and Russia. 

I will back whomever wins the leadership election (and it'll be fun to see, in the event Corbyn doesnt win, how many rabid Corbyn supporters will immediately disappear from this sub and off to the Green Party one), however, if Corbyn does win, he will receive my complete non-stop derision and scrutiny for his entire foreign policy packet, which is wrong through and through.

Because it's discrete and contained I think the police prefer them to street prostitution, as long as they're not using trafficked women. There must be some quiet agreement to just let them be because everyone involved realises the futility of trying to remove the trade. 

Prostitution is not illegal, but 'controlling' prostitutes/prostitution is. So a woman can sell herself for sex in a flat/premises, but the law states (afaik) that if there's any more than one person in the premises which is involved in the sex business, it's an illegal brothel.

Exactly my point. Culture is not a valid argument here because the charge is being applied to other cultural events. Nobody can define what is or isn't cultural, so you either apply the charge to all events or none.

Teams in the NFL use the same results and measures for finding quarterback suitability vs other roles. I think it's really a measure of strategic thinking ability and finding people that are built for that.

A company I'm interviewing with currently gave me a two hour timed test involving maths scenarios using real decisions I'd need to take every day, coupled with a raw data set which I had to pivot, organise, analyse to get answers. It was challenging and I couldn't do a couple of the questions, but fundamentally I enjoyed doing it because it was with their legitimate real data. It works better for them too, it's just a simulation, but it'll give you an early read on whether the employee grasps the job or not (I'm still yet to get my results).

I think the frustration of many when they read these things is that they feel their education is worth-less because of it, not so. It indicates your ability to think on multiple levels and understand complex things, it acts as a marker that you're the kind of person they need for the job, and that's important.

There are some 300,000 farms across the UK. I've lived in farming communities all my life and one thing farms have no shortage of are derelict  &amp; disused buildings. Buildings that would make great family homes.

What's more, if each farm converted a building into a couple of houses they'd be spread pretty evenly across the countryside so the extra 600k+ houses brought onto the market wouldn't have a significant impact on the infrastructure of any single local authority.

Protecting the green-belt should be about protecting its character and preventing new structures from being constructed, it shouldn't be about preventing existing under-utilized structures (which there are millions of) from being better utilized.

Of course this isn't the case, lots of people wish to live and commute from rural locations. Hence the gentrification of what were once cheap farmworker's villages and are now desirable commuter towns.   
...This also has the effect of forcing farm workers to live in caravans on the farm they're working at as they find it impossible to buy *or rent* anywhere nearby due to being pushed out of the market by middle-class city commuters.

It's patently obvious that people do in fact desire to live in these sorts of locations. So why deliberately stifle their development by only giving VAT relief to the big housing developers?

A parade is a form of **public** assembly. A sporting/charity event isn't necessarily such. Members of the public attend, but they are on private grounds. 

Not to mention these rules are now falling more in line with the rest of the UK and Ireland. Which is a relatively good thing given most of our hoard of backwards legislation.

However I would urge organisations to challenge the new policy and show how they are cultural and publicly relevent. Especially GAA events and the like because that is a sport that is a part of Irish culture. 

This has everything to do with democracy and the idea behind what drives free society. I find it so fucking retarded that you've said Why should people who don't engage with [x] pay for it. Because that's what happens in a free and open democracy. You pay for things you don't like. I find that more palatable than draconian measures to curb freedom of expression.

I don't go to church and I don't like the idea of Catholic Maintained Schools. Why should I pay for them? I'm a homophobe! Why should I pay for a homosexual's HIV treatment? I hate Sinn Fein, why should I pay their wages? And so on. 

The idea of democracy is fucking well underpinned by the idea of putting up with that which you don't like. Otherwise it's a tyranny of the majority. I don't like your opinion and beliefs - I find them stupid, closed minded, and ignorant of what constitutes a free society - but that doesn't mean I think you should pay for it. That's the slippery slope I see occuring in the long run: ""You will pay for your dissent or deviation from the accepted norm.""

That's your decision but it did happen. Also, you can say that I should have challenged it but I was desperate for a job after university and was having pressure put on me to get one. Plus, having a Japanese guy losing his rag in a room with you is nerve wracking, but at the time, at first, I wasn't sure whether it was a test used on all candidates or whether he was just losing the plot after a bad day. I only found out later in the interview.

Finally, you say challenge it, the laws are not so simple when you are abroad and there's an entirely different culture. In the two years I worked at the company I saw lots of crazy things going on and I've also seen people who've been sent on business to Tokyo come back completely drained, not because of jet lag, but because of the work culture there, which is work, work, work and then head to the casino afterwards and gamble, gamble, gamble.

All of the technology to handle different percentages, tiered payments etc already exists in payroll software to handle things like pension contributions, taxes etc. Employees are already able to specify their own pension contribution level either as a fixed amount or as a percentage of pay. They also support Payroll Donations, for people that like to automatically give money each month to charity. All of that involves zero intervention from payroll staff on a day to day or month to month basis.

Source: I used to support and help troubleshoot the payroll system for a public sector organisation over 10 years ago (amongst other duties).

null,null,combatjohnny,flair1,,null,"""Emmanuel Adebayor’s switch to Aston Villa is off after the Tottenham Hotspur forward failed to be persuaded to leave London.
Villa had identified the Togo forward as their first-choice replacement for Christian Benteke, who joined Liverpool for £32.5 million, in a move which would have seen Adebayor reunited with Tim Sherwood, his former manager at Tottenham.
Yet despite two separate rounds of talks between the Villa manager and player - and the Midlands club being willing to spend £100,000 a week on his wages - the two parties have been unable to reach an agreement.
It is understood Adebayor had even undergone a medical with Villa late last month, however the deal has stalled in the last week as he mulled over the move with the Villa hierarchy having becoming increasingly resigned to the fact his preference is to remain in the capital.
The former Arsenal and Manchester City striker’s reluctance to swap White Hart Lane for Villa Park has now forced them to begin looking for alternatives just 48 hours before they begin their Barclays Premier League campaign at Bournemouth.
Villa have not closed the door fully on a deal being revived, though, should the 31-year-old undergo a change of heart as they are determined to find a stellar replacement for Benteke.
They have already signed Rudy Gustede from Blackburn Rovers and Jordan Ayew from Lorient, however Sherwood remains eager to further bolster his options as Villa look to avoid another brush with relegation this term.""",null,0,null,1438870564,null,null,false,0,cttkenq,null,t3_3g08kn,null,null,null,t3_3g08kn,null,null,null,1440316900,null,24,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,24,null

I support the renaming of Derry because it'd easier to say and every protestant or unionist I know bar one uses Derry too. If you remove either nationalist thinking the common sense option is Derry.

They weren't very strong unionists in any case. And are you seriously trying to paint the current government as anti-protestant for their education cuts? FG has a well known reputation for being the most protestant of the parties. There is at least one protestant minister, even if her performance is a bit shocking.

Employers were more worried about their investments when supporting a new republic than employees. The new republic was mostly led by the middle classes. Not even sure what coherent point you're trying to make about Belfast.

And do you think what happened in Ireland happened in a vacuum? Ten thousand people showed up to a celebration of the first anniversary of the Russian Revolution in Dublin led by many leading figures of the looming independence movement despite their nationalist tendencies. The military strategy for the Rising was based off that of the Paris Commune and Russian Revolution of 1905.

No one who has a clue is taking Corbyn seriously. Honestly I'm a Tory and he scares me. Not because he has any chance of winning. But because I worry about the loonys in the Tory party who might come out if he wins. 

The parallels between him and Trump are enormous.

Also OP people dismiss him out of hand because his policies have been tried. The left was in power once and it was the 70s. A lot on here won't talk about that but all of his policies have been tried and they failed miserably. Socialism and communism don't work and there isn't a single example where they have in human history. He spouts a lot of populist rhetoric that sounds great but is completely ineffectual in reality. The horrible reality is that as a society we rely on a 20% who work and drive us forward. If you demonise and punish that 20% they leave. And why shouldn't they? People should be rewarded for wealth creation and entrepreneurialism. Under a Corbyn government these people are the enemy.

There is a real life example of Corbyn right now. It's called Syriza and Venezuela. That's what would happen if Corbyn won.

This is all of course a completely moot point because Corbyn could never win a general election.

Also, if this was ""unlawful"" then it makes sense it was overturned because it isn't compatible with the law, although it highlights in a very public way that the actual law is ridiculous and needs changing. Let's hope they do that instead, because I'm pretty sure they also know how ridiculous it and the legal consequence are if you follow it to the letter. Obviously this aspect of the law will never be enforced, because it means 99% of people in the UK are breaking the law (including MP's, judges etc.), not because they are morally corrupt or evil or anything, but because the law is outdated and unworkable.

Under the PAYE systems employers are required by law to submit in real-time, so it'll be easy for HMRC to work out what's going on once you tell them where your money is coming from anyway. 

The first thing to do is to make sure you've got everything down in writing such as your pay rate and contract of employment (just something that says you are working there, your hours etc, nothing necessarily verbose). This should give you basic legal grounding if something were to happen to you.. but tbh it sounds more like you'll be better off finding a new employer anyway.

null,null,scuzzmonkey69,null,null,null,"Sorry, but you're strawmaning rather than addressing the point I'm making.

RBS was too big to fail and to minimise the effect on the economy the Government had to bail them out, that is undeniable. However, the share price of RBS has been higher than 500p for the past 20 years. In fact, before the crash it was up at 5772p. 

Now, past performance is no promise of future earnings, but the Government bailing out the bank *by purchasing shares* is absolutely a decision taken based on the ability to sell them off later. This is because the bank _could_ have been bailed out by a form of bridge loan, or quantitative easing, neither of which resulting in the ownership of the enterprise by the Government, but that isn't what happened and the Government ended up with a large % ownership of RBS.

So the question becomes what should the Government do with those shares? I think there are two main arguments:
- Hold on to the shares for long enough that when you sell them they are for a break even or for-profit price to regain the money spent to save the enterprise, or
- Sell the shares at a loss, on the basis that decreased (or no) Government ownership will allow the enterprise to increase its tax payments via an increase in profit, and in the long run end up paying back the money spent to save the enterprise.

The third option is that we paid a load of money to save a business that will never pay that money back. If that is the case, then we must ask the question of *why was it saved?*",null,0,null,1438874438,null,null,false,0,cttmtlk,null,t3_3fv513,null,null,null,t1_cttfgds,null,null,null,1440318038,null,1,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

&gt;**Top-level comments must make a substantive point.**
&gt;
&gt;* This is to encourage actual discussion. Replies directly to the original post are a starting point for that. Low-effort comments which cannot start a meaningful discussion will be removed. This applies equally to links as to self posts. Low-effort comments are things like off-hand remarks of any length that don't make any real point; tribal insults towards a particular group or party; quoting single words from the title of a linked article as if to suggest doubt in its sincerity of use; advice animals, etc. What exactly is considered low-effort is left to moderator discretion.
&gt;
&gt;* More leniency is given to non-top-level comments, though moderators reserve the right to remove anything low-effort if we consider it destructive. Jokes and other non-serious stuff are fine outside of top-level comments, but don't get carried away.

It's a pretty low bar to meet, but we do find that enforcing it keeps the standard of discussion at at least a reasonable level here.

No! We played those 2 as a midfield 2 and conceded 4 goals in 6 games - the only team that conceded fewer was Burnley (3). We also scored 18 goals, 6 more than anyone else. The point is whenever we played with 1 striker we were perfectly fine with those 2 playing next to each other.

We played 4-3-3 in pre season. It's literally impossible for Silva to have played the exact same role he always does, because we haven't played 4-3-3.

We didn't get torn apart by any lower table teams last year FFS, this hyperbole about our defence is moronic. We conceded less than a goal a game, roughly the same as Arsenal and United, and Hart won the golden glove. If we were being torn apart, how did that happen?

Also all of this is pretty irrelevant - we're going to play 4-3-3, or we wouldnt have done it all pre-season, and we're going after De Bruyne.

Socialism wasn't tried and it failed. We still live in a fairly socialist country. Your education, health care, your grandparents pension, the roads you travel on to work were all things funded under socialist principles. Putting the railways and utilities into private hands has hardly been a roaring success.

Socalism hit a bump in the road in the 70s, Thatcher was able to take advantage. She was unpopular and was losing the election until she was saved by the Falkland War.

Because Tevez loves Boca, not Juve. He requested then number when he first joined and the club had more than enough faith in him to wear it. Pogba definitely loves Juve, even enough to wear a shirt that, like you said, means a lot to us fans. It's a sign of loyalty and respect letting your fans know that you're here to make a name for yourself and to prove you're as good as the previous players who've worn it.

I honestly have no idea how that protects you from a legal stand point, but I have had had several contracts amended on moving day. For example, my previous rental included some white goods that were clearly quite dated. The contract specified that we as tenants were responsible for the upkeep of the white goods, and for replacing them if we damaged them. I spoke to the landlord and explained we weren't super excited about the prospect of replacing a 10 year old tumble dryer if it conked out, he agreed so we amended the contract in pen to say that we would not have to replace it if it stopped working. 

It was hand written in ink in the margin next to the section on white goods. Now I don't know anything about tenancy law, but I went along with this method because I had seen it before several times and because there would have been an £80 fee for the agent to redraw the contract. 

Once more, I have no legal expertise, but tenancy laws in the UK are pretty strong in favour of the tenants. Providing whatever you disputed on the original document wasn't wildly outrageous, you both agreed to something and signed your names to it, even if it no longer exists physically it exists in spirit.

Did we all just forget about the recent election? Or the indyref? Do we really have one-month memories in this country?

As for the article, the SNP protected tuition fees and kept the our NHS out the hands of privitisers. They have my vote for that alone. Stuff like that is why they are popular. 

You could rip this article apart line by line, it's full of bullshit and cherry-picked stats &amp; very selective comparisons with ""England""* only where there is a ""favourable"" result. Blaming the SNP &amp; NHS for Scotland's historic health problems was a nice touch. Saying that removing tuition fees ""had no impact"" is a complete misrepresentation as the Westminster-imposed fees had only been in place for a year or so and had no time to ""have impact"" themselves.

Protesting a parade is a passtime of hobby, who pays? The protester or the parader? Or the public as a whole as a compromise? 

I don't think parades are vital, I don't think funding the arts -MAC, Lyric, civic monuments, art, commissioned works, are vital. But I'm happy for them to be funded.

For the courts to decide someone would have to put a case forward. As I have already fucking said. Challenge the law. But challenging the law simply because you don't like something is silly. 

Challenging it because it is unjustified, undemocratic, prejudicial. Fine. But I would rather see people doing things I don't like and being given as much if not more protection under the law than I than see you kill something rather than let it die off as the population desires. 

I think many things in a democracy should be sacred cows. One of those things is the freedom of association and assembly. Be that for the gays, KKK, Black Militants, Islamic fundamentalists, Loyalists, Republicans, the religious, the secular, what fucking ever. 

You say let the courts decide. Well bring it before the courts then. Someone will have to. Challenge the law, that's the right thing to do. 

But do remember that this policy is under review for a year which is something I would consider reasonably scientific and evidence based and also it seems more democratic to me than ""make them bear the burder of freedom of assembly, and the burden of those protesting against them.""

If you had your way and they did pay for the policing cost - would the protesters have to pay to protest?

I agree with your options for what they could do. But you're not addressing my point either: namely that they *had to be saved* - hence bailout, not investment. 

Holding on to the shares doesn't make sense when they could use the money as a government now while they are in power. It's too risky not to sell since it's hard to say that 5 years will be enough to turn a huge bank around. 

If they sell, they increase their cashflow now *and* the option for future tax returns remains open. 

There's also an underlying issue about the relationship between markets and the government. Currently the public *absolutely despise* the banking industry. This adds tension to the system, especially when government (accountable to the public) is sitting on what is effectively a business. 

For things to turn around, confidence on all sides needs to be restored. One way is to have the government/regulators be more active than they already have been. Naturally, no one in the right mind would be expecting this from the current administration.

Whether or not his performances were up to scratch are up to opinion, but that he wasn't selected that much was a reflection of that.

&gt; In general, we think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy. Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem. For example, if a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the U.S. release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate's service is more valuable.

null,null,the_ultravixens,null,null,null,"Alright, Chomsky, calm down.

Firstly, there is no free market.  The government interferes in and backstops all kinds of industries, from farming to housing to banking.  It does this precisely because markets can be unpredictable, subject to shocks and don't always bring around the desired outcome.

I'm sure it's wonderful to have cathartic fantasies about people butchering people who work in finance, but the experience of past years shows that the poor were the ones who suffered the most from banking collapses when they *lost their savings*.  Keeping things like deposit insurance a functioing payment system running is, without a doubt, in the public interest.  Christ, fixing market failures is one of governments main jobs.  I don't see anyone here bitching about the government stepping in to rescue other things like the car industry, where was the ""let them fail"" crowd then?

Anyway, the banking system very obviously is under democratic control, because our government sets the rules and regs.  Does the finance industry have considerable lobbying power?  Of course, and that's a bad thing which ideally we should try to change, along with all sorts of other issues surrounding what our banking system is for, and how incentives within it are structured.

Besides which the financial crisis was probably kicked off by a number of proximate causes, including a spike in oil prices due to near term peaking, fraudulent lending practices, opaque derivatives packaging, emergent network properties and the fact that we were only a few decades into building a hyper-connected global system which transmits shocks at unprecedented speed and which *nobody really understands*.  New things break in new ways, colour me surprised.

This is probably the biggest thing. I got a 2:2 from Oxford for Physics and for many places this is just the cutoff. Too many applicants, they need to draw the line somwhere. It's not their fault.

I'm now doing a 1 year Masters in Computer Science at Birmingham (to ""mask"" that 2:2)... Compared to Oxford I can sneeze and get a distinction. Maybe it's the course, but the difference I've seen from Oxford to Birmingham was **many** times more dramatic than I'd ever thought it would be. The teaching is done at a **much** slower pace, and I could learn an entire module (there were 8) in about 2 days here. The teaching is completely impersonal. It just doesn't compare.

I'm not really sure what to take away from this though. It could just be the Physics to Comp Sci jump, or it could be teaching/course itself.

I think it's a pretty good argument against finance capitalism, and doing to the City of London what Thatcher did to the miners - shutting it down so that the pernicious political influence they have can be removed. 

Without the nest of corruption and fraud called the City of London the Tory party would be fucking broke and wouldn't be able to function.

I will ask this. Which of these Corbyn policies do you agree with: Giving the falklands back to argentina, dismantling Trident, leaving NATO, rent controls.

These are the only policies he has actively advocated. Do you honestly need reasons for why these policies are daft? 

He claims he wants to 'end austerity'. We're currently running one of the biggest budget deficits in the world. This myth that we're not spending needs to end. We are spending gigantic sums of money. He also has never costed anything. He just claims that he will borrow to pay for everything. That means that we will get tanked by the markets and our borrowing costs will go through the roof as will inflation. Which will hurt the lower classes who are not asset owners far more than it will hurt the asset owners (the rich).

The Reddit left doesn't like to acknowledge reality but there it is. You can't spend in perpetuity.

Hear me out. 

How often does Liverpool finish exactly in fourth place? Since 1995 it's only been 5 times. Between 1960 and 1995 we didn't finish 4th even once. So unless we start finishing fourth regularly, losing that spot will not affect us enough to be concerned.

The champions league places, as they are now, only benefit the status quo. Arsenal, United, city and Chelsea benefit from the champions league places immensely. They also stand to lose the most if one or more of those spots is taken away. Liverpool wouldn't really lose anything at this stage if the fourth spot was lost. 

While we are not part of the top four, anything to disrupt the status quo is beneficial to us. Throwing one of the current top four out of the champions league puts us on the same playing field as them. Of course once we get back into the champions league, the status quo starts working in our favour, and a return to 4 spots might help keep us there.

Do we? Your examples are shit. An education in a Catholic school doesn't cost the public any more than one in a state school; and 'being a homophobic dickhead' is not 'making a rational decision'. Exactly how a person gets to the point of needing vital healthcare doesn't change the fact that they need it.

&gt;Protesting a parade is a passtime of hobby, who pays? The protester or the parader? Or the public as a whole as a compromise?

Except that isn't a compromise. The vast majority of us neither protest or parade. Compromise would be sharing the cost between those who do. And yes, if the protests are as regular an occurrence as the parades themselves, they should pay for the cost of their protests. It would incentivise good behaviour on both sides. 

&gt;Challenging it because it is unjustified

It is unjustified and unjustifiable in my opinion. All your raving about democracy and freedom of assembly isn't relevant to the discussion. The PSNI doesn't decide whether marches go ahead or not, that's the Parades Commission. The Parades Commission decides on appropriate restrictions on freedom of assembly; the PSNI polices those that go ahead. 

The fact is that it costs the public a significant amount of money in a time when we're short on it. Unless there's a good reason why they should be subsidised, and you still haven't provided one, the cost should be passed on.

And no, I'm not going to challenge it, because to be honest I don't care enough to do so. It wouldn't stop any parades from going ahead, just free up funds to go elsewhere. I have an opinion on the matter, and it's that parades should be included in this scheme.

&gt;Since Martinez came in the only big player we've sold is Fellaini, while Barkley, Stones, Macca, Baines, Coleman and Mirallas have all been targeted by bigger clubs. And with the Fellaini sale you can argue that he never fit Martinez's style, so it was no skin off his nose. 

&gt;As much as last season was a bummer, Martinez and the board have kept our core players, and added on top of them. Moyes would've probably sold either Barkley or Stones by now, possibly both, and likely never would've brought in Lukaku.

You realize that is what you are saying, right? You were using a player being out of favor as evidence they are a committee signing. That argument is not smart to me precisely because I read it.

And show me evidence of those players that you listed above being committee signings from trusted media sources. I've only ever seen Pearce say Balo and Eto'o were presented as choices for Rodgers by the rest of the committee. And Rodgers could've easily chosen neither, given that we had Lambert, Sturridge, Borini at the time, and that he went on to play Sterling at ST for many games.

But, again, this is all silly because the committee only recommends targets to Rodgers, who then chooses amongst them. And he is on the committee himself and is the most integral person. Committee signings are Rodgers signings, simple as that:

&gt;Over the past three years Rodgers has always had the final say on signings and no player has been brought in without him giving the deal the green light.

Boards are there to represent the shareholders of the company, setting strategy, hiring and firing senior execs etc. 

If the unions could in some way demonstrate that having Union involvement at the board would improve shareholder returns (other than through threat of strikes) then I'm sure most companies would welcome it. So it seems to me that the onus is on the unions to modernise themselves and reposition themselves so that they are seen as a positive force in a company, for the benefit of the shareholders as well as employees, rather than as a group solely interested in representing the employees, resistant to change and modernisation and with a political chip on their shoulders.

If you look up your links you'll see that the **SNECMA** (not Dassault) engine is smaller (half a metre shorter), 100 kg lighter, and has about the same specific fuel consumption.

Top speed is not an overwhelming concern in modern fighters, and depends more on aerodynamics than the engines. Rate of climb, service ceiling and low-level maximum speed are more important factors, and there Rafale is very close to the Eurofighter. Rafale has arguably *better* range and a significantly higher payload.

Which all makes sense: the French wanted a more versatile fighter-bomber, that could do air-to-ground attack missions just as well as air-to-air missions. The British, Germans and Italians, on the other hand, had just built the Tornado, which was a cutting-edge fighter-bomber at the time, but a mediocre air-to-air fighter, so they wanted a pure air superiority fighter. The Spanish hesitated between joining them or the French, but finally also chose the air superiority option because they had just taken delivery of US-built F-18s, which are also good fighter-bombers rather than pure air-to-air fighters.

The French also wanted the plane to be lighter, because they intended to use them on their carriers. The Typhoon would have been too heavy for them.

Your home gas bill would make no sense; your employer has nothing to do with your gas bill, and your home spending on gas has no effect on your employment.

Arts council and anything to do with the arts, history and heritage, bike to work schemes, any public investment in businesses, museums and community centres, cross border initiatives, benefits for the disadvantaged, expenses for politicians, the vastly over inflated civil service, SPADs, the Parades and Equality Commission. Not really ""vital"" in my view. Some are. But I don't mind that we all pay for all of them together. 

I'm all for as minimal a government as possible. I just don't think it's all that practical in the short term in NI.  Nor do I think charging people to use roads and pavements in a free society so they can express their opinion/culture/religion should lead to more remuneration to the police force. 


I'd say that given people who commit unlawful actions at parades and in surrounding altercations are already arrested, charged, and fined based on the severity of their behaviour we already see a form of charge associated with parades and public order offences. 

If the justice system cannot recoup that then I do not see that as something a law abiding citizen involved in a parade should have to pay for. 

And I honestly don't think the idea of charging parader/protester alike would work in any valuable way. 

Call me a cynic but what I see happening is this - it becomes pay to police parades. More people with a vested interest in stopping a parade act unlawfully. More supporters of said parade retaliate, or continue their parade and are endangered. The cost and violence escalates year by year - a counter productive measure in a post conflict society.

&gt; 
&gt; Spurs forward Adebayor was at Villa's training ground last week for talks and a medical.
&gt; 
&gt; Villa were expecting to unveil Adebayor who is keen to work with ex-Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood.
&gt; 
&gt; Villa were planning to sign him for the final year of his Spurs deal and pick up his £100,000 a week contract.
&gt; 
&gt; But the deal has stalled after Adebayor refused to get a Birmingham pad to break up his travelling.
&gt; 
&gt; Last season loanee Tom Cleverley made his base at The Belfry hotel next to Villa's training ground but Adebayor wants to commute from his London home which has frustrated Sherwood.
&gt; 
&gt; As it stands the proposed transfer is unlikely to go-ahead but a compromise could yet to reached.
&gt; 
&gt; Villa are starting to draw up other attacking targets though.

It might be better to think about what doing a course in Economics &amp; Management would get you longer term, and then think about doing the A levels to match that. You could then apply to a range of universities, including Oxford, and certainly, if you had at 3-4 As or A*s at A level in the right subjects, you might have a chance. Economics and Management is _extremely_ competitive.

How would you fund the degree? Do you have £27k for tuition fees and then another few thousand per year to live on? Will the Romanian government lend you money for tuition fees / living costs? Parents? I'm not sure what how the eligibility criteria for UK funding will affect your case. Read more at the following link: https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies, but I think you might have to have been resident in the UK for at least 3 years to qualify.

You will have to demonstrate to Oxford why you won't just do what you did during the CEGEP programme: getting some A levels quickly and with good grades would help with this. The whole process will take a while as the application deadline for Oxford is 15th October each year, to start the following October: as you won't have previous grades you can rely on to say 'look, I'm clever and hard working', it might be best to sit the A levels so that you have the final grades, and then apply.

If you then don't get sufficiently good grades to get in to Oxford, it won't matter, as getting 3-4 good A levels will still be really good for your career overall!",null,0,null,1438884020,null,null,false,0,ctttowd,null,t3_3fzs38,null,null,null,t3_3fzs38,null,null,null,1440321340,null,7,null,oxforduni,t5_2s4rg,7,null

I will add that I think there's actually a decent chance we break into the top 4 this year. I think United is still gelling and could easily have another off year.

Liverpool have the 5th highest wage bill in the PL which would correlate to 5th place or so in the league. Everyone is expecting top 4 and a trophy. Rodgers showed us in 13/14 he could get top 4. 

However, the one hurdle he has to get passed is handling european football. I think with the depth in various positions we have now he should be able to prepare the squad for more matches. If he shows that he can't handle multiple competitions again in the start of the season then I am not sure there is a point to continuing with him for the future. Remember last season we were crap when we had to play CL games and then strung a run of form together after being eliminated. Then again we were crap after our deep cup run. I don't know if this was due to fatigue, lack of depth or poor rotation.

Apparently the real left-wing thing to do is join the EDL and campaign to bomb Iran. Daily Beast would know...

Raed Salah is a dodgy fucker but that article is dire.

Being asked to condemn the IRA is a trick they've dug up from the 70's to accuse anyone who's in the slightest bit critical of British atrocities in Ireland of being a traitor. He was right to stand his ground. I would never apologise for the IRA, even though I don't agree with the things they did, for as long as Britain doesn't apologise for centuries worth of occupation and bloodletting, far worse than anything the IRA managed.

His foreign policy is one of the best bits about him. Principled, against western imperialism, against Israeli occupation of Palestine, in favour of talks with Sinn Fein, refuses to support the Ukrainian regime and their fascist goons, currently butchering their own civilians in Donbass. Principled against apartheid back when the Tories were selling ""Hang Nelson Mandela"" t-shirts to their young members.

Jeremy Corbyn Campaigned tirelessly against the Iraq War, whilst these same dipshit pundits condemned him for being a supporter of Saddam Hussein, and he was utterly and totally vindicated whilst his opponents have blood on their hands and moral culpability for the disaster their policy led to. He campaigned against the bombing and regime change in Libya, which has led to a failed state on the mediterrean border, opening up routes for people's smugglers and helping to create the catastrophe in the mediterrean right now.

* **Ben Aaronovitch** who was responsible for two of the more brilliant Seventh Doctor serials. First he wrote Remembrance of the Daleks which allows McCoy to bring his Doctor into a more serious and mysterious direction. And then he wrote Battlefield which throws the Doctor into an Arthurian adventure started by an unknown future incarnation who was Merlin forcing him bluff his way through it, allows the Brigadier to return in triumphant fashion.

* **Barbara Clegg** who wrote Enlightenment although I think a good deal of my enjoyment of this serial comes from its direction by Fiona Cumming. Regardless I think it ends the Black Guardian trilogy on a worthwhile note and the Eternals were a neat idea. I also really wish Clegg and Cumming could have worked on more serials together as I feel they complimented each other really well.

* **Ian Briggs** because although Dragonfire wasn't that great he did introduce the character of Ace and The Curse of Fenric is brilliant.

* **Mervyn Haisman/Henry Lincoln** who co wrote The Abominable Snowman and The Web of Fear (and the Dominators). Not only did they introduce the then Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart in The Web of Fear but they also wrote him the best in my opinion. He was a bit incredulous but he didn't let it get in the way of doing his job and he was a commanding presence from the moment he entered in episode 3.

* **Robert Holmes** who I like so much that I wish I could go back in time and change history so he could survive long enough to finish his version of The Ultimate Foe.

* **Don Houghton** who I would love even if he only did Inferno but he also did The Mind of Evil which is a solid serial with some really great moments.

* **Malcolm Hulke** who cowrote The War Games and Ambassadors of Death and gave us one of the best Pertwee serials Doctor Who and the Silurians and I just love Invasion of the Dinosaurs especially due to some interesting character development. 

New Who

* **Robert Shearman** who has been woefully underutilized by both Big Finish and the television series. Dalek alone should hopefully inspire people of his abilities but there is so much more he could have done.

* **Phil Ford** was already one of my favorites just for The Waters of Mars (although I really do wish they would have played out Time Lord Victorious a bit longer). It is quite a playful script at first which makes the dramatic turn later even more impacting. Into the Dalek isn't a perfect episode but there is a lot to love about it. And in a way I find it a  strong compliment to The Waters of Mars in a way.

* **Jamie Mathieson** who definitely penned two of the best Series 8 episodes handling Twelve's moral questioning brilliantly and adding a cool new monster to Doctor Who mythos.

* **Simon Nye** because I love Amy's Choice to bits especially because of the Dream Lord.

* **Moffat and RTD** are pretty much a given so I won't really say anything more about them.",null,0,null,1438885208,null,null,1438892611,0,cttukq1,null,t3_3g06dp,null,null,null,t3_3g06dp,null,null,null,1440321757,null,10,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10,null

No. It shouldn't be available whatsoever on the NHS, in fact it should be made illegal. 

The people who preach homeopathy prey on the weak, *literally*, they are modern day snake oil salesmen, the lowest of the low. My father was amongst those they preyed on when he was dying, my mother grasped at all sorts of alternative medicine to compliment the radio and chemotherapy, the only effect was a temporary dash of hopefulness, followed by a further plunge into despair the next time my dad had a seizure. I'm all in favour of things to keep peoples spirits and morale up, but homeopathy shouldn't be amongst them.

We have sugar pills and whatnot if we want to give placebos out.

If we allow homeopathy, the next ""*logical*"" step is the opting out of vaccines in place of ""*organic*"" vaccines and all that bullshit. Nah, fuck that.

I don't know if you've noticed, but when you drive at night next time check it out.

The headlights on the drivers side don't shine as wide &amp; far as the headlights on the passenger side. The aim of this is to dazzle oncoming drivers as little as possible. 

Obviously when you take a UK car to France for example, the headlights work in the opposite way - i.e. it is the drivers side headlight which will shine most brightly on the oncoming driver. As a result you must place small deflectors on your headlights to alter the beam direction so we don't go around dazzling the French.

[Here is a diagram showing what I mean](https://www.hotrodhotline.com/sites/default/files/images/Headlights%20MD-18.jpg) and [here is a photo of what the deflectors look like](http://shop.theaa.com/files/2014-IMAGES/Eurolites-Land-Rover-1.jpg). So in the diagram of the light spread, it is the side that goes 30m which should be facing oncoming drivers. But when UK cars drive on the continent, it is the side that shines 60m.

It's actually pretty strange owning a car that wasn't specifically designed for the UK market.

null,null,Nwengbartender,null,null,null,"Not ignoring that fundamental at all. It is an undersupplied market in some areas, theres places where the demand is so high people make silly snap decisions and pay fortunes for it, both privately with landlords and through agents. When it comes to tenant fees the main reason they are so high is that they are unregulated, there needs to be government intervention in this to establish a set framework, at the minute it is a case of charge what you think you can get away with and that is wrong. 

It needs to be regulated as it needs to be a negotiation point to be taken away from cowboy agents. I recently came across an agent that charges way below market value to their landlords. They make up this shortfall in income by taking multiple applications and fees on a property, a large part of which is non-refundable. They also don't establish if a person is actually able to move, the agent in question agreed to a let with someone who still had 4 months left in a fixed term contract and they were unable to afford both at the same time putting them in an incredibly compromised position financially. It is agents like this that make it so hard to prove yourself as a reputable agent with morals. 

If you make it as simple as one application per property, with a nationally agreed affordable fee for tenants then you can stop agents like this getting away with it.

Agents will always exist, the trick will be to ensure that those that survive are those that are well regulated and also charging reasonable fees to both sides. 

By the way for a point for everyone to research about the cost of using agents from both sides, look deeper into the cost of rightmove. That side is free to use from a buyer or tenants side, but by god they charge massive amounts to agents, it's roughly equivalent to a full time member of staff for most agents.

Actual answer would be Moffat though, nearly all of my favorite NuWho episodes are by him even though he has consistent flaws and has trouble writing something coherent when it comes to stories stretching across seasons. 

Seriously, Moffat wrote *Empty Child/Doctor Dances*, *The Girl in the Fireplace*, *Blink*, *Silence in the Library*, *A Christmas Carole* and *Listen*. That means my top 10 list of NuWho is more than half Moffat. Again, he also has duds but he has consistently turned out the majority of the episodes I love. 

Mathieson seems promising considering the strength of the two episodes last season. Toby Whithouse's episodes have been good to great (*The God Complex* is one of the only highlights in series 6).

It's really not a British league as it's only Cardiff, Swansea, and Newport (I think) who play in the English structure and they are exceptions due to the size of their clubs compared to other Welsh ones.
