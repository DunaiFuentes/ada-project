I'm not sure why we would take him on loan since he's only played a season in Germany.

They finished above us by 2 points, that could well be the other way round if one of Pelle's woodwork shots went in during our dry run. 

We lost against Liverpool true, but not because we were outplayed. At St Mary's if I remember correctly they had ONE shot the entire first half, and it was a Coutinho wondergoal. We were denied 2 penalties which easily could have changed the game. We were the better team for most of the match, and I can't remember the other game but I seem to recall that we weren't outclassed then either.

I'm not saying now that we've finished 7th we're going to finish 4th and get CL next year, that would be ludicrous. But Liverpool aren't either. They had an amazing season with Suarez and nearly won the league, but the few seasons preceding that and now after they've shown that if things stand they'll finish around 6th each time. We've shown that we are capable of this too, both teams are in the Europa league.

Look at the Great Western Main Line. While the government and Network Rail are doing the electrification, the government (mostly) and First Great Western have been looking at new trains to put on it, and have placed orders for new intercity trains to run on the line when it's ready

It's said that this is one of the reasons why this isn't one of the projects that have been delayed, since trains are on the way and they can't be left rotting in a yard for years. No new trains have been ordered for other electrification projects so they can take a slower pace.

It's called the Department for Transport, and they make all of the decisions that really matter - from trains to frequencies to fares to infrastructure investment.

The people that don't want him (myself included) don't want him because Aston Villa will only sell him for silly money and that silly money could be spent more wisely than thrown at someone who actually **has** struggled with injury in the past few seasons (Achilles, groin, knee and hip to be precise) so **is** a massive gamble no matter how many goals he scored for Villa.

That's kind of a surface reason for not even trying to sign him, so then you go into **if** we signed him, will he be able to adapt to the way we've spent 3 years trying to play? Statistically, no. His pass completion for last season was 66% - doesn't matter what position you're playing - for a top flight player, that's poor. To put that in perspective Balotelli managed 70%, Ings managed 71% and Origi managed 77% pass completion. 

Speaking of Balotelli, much like Benteke they both like to drop deep and link up the play and neither have the movement to make up the ground once the play has advanced. So when you've got a Coutinho &amp; Firmino looking for a final pass, trying to work their magic and do what they do best, Benteke would still be trying to catch up, or get a lay off for a drive at goal. 

Honestly, on my anti-Benteke crusade I've found more reasons than I could possibly imagine not to sign him. This guy thinks it's about the fact Benteke's coming from Villa and he's a target man and he's totally wrong. Benteke could have every rabona, step over &amp; rainbow flick in the world under his belt and be playing for Bayern but I'd tell this guy the exact same thing. 

Big fish, small pond. Questionable injury record. Drops far too deep and can't keep up. Isn't technically all that gifted or able. There are better players for better prices.

I really doubt that policy would be legally enforceable. Many companies have policies saying if you choose to give a reference in your personal capacity you must expressly say so, not use company emails/letterheads etc which is fair enough. Preventing an employee from talking about work and their colleague (which is effectively what a reference is) seems pretty unenforceable. However, I see the issue that colleagues may not want to go agaisnt the policy anyway. 

Can you go back to another employer? Do you have a boss/colleague that had left your work recently you can ask? If UCAS are interested in facts can you provide your HR team with facts to confirm (even if it goes beyond their normal reference, a company should confirm unambiguous and objective facts are true)?

Because not wanting to insult minorities=Stalinism. Because I need to point out that that's what Orwell wrote about, Stalinism, not political correctness but his hatred of Stalinist politics, in Orwell's works that deal with dystopian governments totalitarianism, personality cults and the betrayal of revolutionary values are attacked just as equally as censorship. One of these are linked with wanting to set up some groups in society as protected from perceived harassment/oppression, but you, apparently missing the rest of Orwell's many themes linked two that aren't even particularly close in political correctness and totalitarian censorship. Have you ever noticed that in Animal Farm Napoleon bans the attacking of the Pig leader class, not the attacking of the Sheep lower class in a possibly misguided attempt to protect them. Political Correctness is an often poor way to protect those seen as weak, Orwell's writings were attacking groups who held unimaginable political power and used censorship to protect themselves.

Using Orwell's works as a byword for all and any forms of censorship is like saying that A Christmas Carol is a great book to advertise socialism, there are similar concepts, greed is bad, help the poor. But there are still huge strides of difference between the two ideas. 

TLDR: You've taken one aspect of the main theme of Orwell's writing and used it to attack something very different from what Orwell attacked when he wrote Animal Farm and 1984. Orwell's stated aim was to criticise Stalinism, so the word Orwellian should really only apply to Stalinist, or Stalinist-like powers, I think you'll agree political correctness is a far cry from Stalinism. So your use of Orwellian is totally over the top and pretty poor.

And you believe if that loyalty is not unwavering then Chelsea should force Cech to see out his contract in a bit part role for the next year steadily fostering resentment for the club he played at for over a decade? 

Why precisely should Cech do what is best for Chelsea over what is best for him? He is merely languishing on the bench and let us not forget that he not innately loyal to the club. Of course having played their for so long he has massive affinity for it now, but there is absolutely nothing so say he should place the interests of Chelsea over the interests of himself. Clearly the two do not coincide now. 

His children are growing up in London and he wants that to continue for the benefit of their futures. He too wants to continue to play football at the highest level. Arsenal offer him that now and unfortunately Chelsea do not. 

Chelsea's only other option was to force Cech to see out the rest of his contract. Whilst that arguably would be the best thing to do in Chelsea's purest interest as a competitive football club, those in charge have clearly determined that Cech's immense service to the club allows him some favour.

null,false,notthathunter,,Bangor,null,"I think the ""we have no infrastructure"" argument is somewhat overstated. 

Though we do have a limited rail network, it is astonishingly cheap compared to the privatised trains in the rest of the United Kingdom, as well as being comparable in scale to the rail network in the south. It is also features a number of recently refurbished trains and stations, all paid for by both the British government and the European Union. Moreover, there has been significant investment in infrastructure in Northern Ireland in the past 50 years - except most of it has been rebuilding damage done by conflict, rather than improving what already exists. Even so, that has begun to change since the Good Friday Agreement: for example, the three most impressive new buildings built in Bangor over the past five years have all been built by the public sector.

You also point to the border as the reason for Northern Ireland's economic problems. I think this, while it may be somewhat of a contributing factor, is an overly simplistic analysis. For example, two of the main industries that helped Northern Ireland beome economically successful during the Industrial Revolution - textiles and shipbuilding - were among those most vulnerable to increasing mechanisation as well as outsourcing to developing nations, leaving Northern Ireland's economy in a uniquely bad position. 

Also, though border regions are probably somewhat adversely affected economically, regions distant from a nations economic centre also suffer. This can be seen in West of Ireland, the North East of England, the South of Italy, and numerous other regions around the world. This would likely still just as true in a United Ireland, as more resources would continue to be centred around Dublin, with Belfast being disadvantaged.

Your final point, though, is the least credible. Though TTIP will undoubtably have an impact on trade, there is little chance that it will mean the NHS will cease to exist. Why? The electorate simply wouldn't stand for it. If healthcare in the UK stopped being free at the point of use, the party that introduced it would be horrifically punished at the polls. Even UKIP, [whose deputy leader endorse increaing privatisation](http://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/paul-nuttall-nhs-disappearing-comments.html) had to commit to a well-funded NHS free at the point of use in their manifesto. That advantage of staying in the UK - and not having to pay for ambulances is a pretty big one, if you ask me - is not going away any time soon.

&gt;__Scotch-Irish__ (or __Scots-Irish__) __Americans__ are [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans) descendants of [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) and other [Ulster Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Protestant) [Dissenters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissenters) from the Irish province of [Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster) who migrated to [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) during the 18th and 19th centuries.   While an estimated 36 million Americans (12% of the total population) reported Irish ancestry in 2006, and 6 million (2% of the population) reported Scottish ancestry,  an additional 5.4 million (1.8% of the population) identified more specifically with Scotch-Irish ancestry. The term *Scotch-Irish* is used only in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)  with people in [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain) or [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland), who are of a similar ancestry, referring to themselves as [Ulster Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Scots_people).

I had totally forgotten about it over the last couple of weeks given that we are so focused on the two major departures and lots of people wanted a second striker - but part of our problem with scoring was definitely a lack of creativity and threat from midfield.  

I am very much in two minds about Tadic - he played well at the start of the season but over the whole season I'd have rated him as having done poorly. He didn't threaten with key passes or shots enough, and some of his stats were inflated by the 4 assists in the Sunderland game. Take those away and his actual statistical contribution was not much. More importantly when watching him play he just wasn't good enough in most/all areas we needed him to be for too much of the season.  

Other than Cabeye though, I don't know if we have actually been linked with too many creative attacking midfielders. Especially that seem to be effective through a central role. Tadic did extemely well from the left but then spent the rest of the season on the right. With J-Rod and ManÃ© both playing from the left, and Juanmi possibly able to, I don't know we'll see Tadic on the left or not.  

I don't know if someone like Matt Phillips fills that role? Maybe one of the championship creative types? Will Hughes? Bamford?  

Hmmm. Interesting to ponder, but I agree I'd like to see a creative attacking midfielder. One who could take a bit of the goalscoring burden, which is another thing we lacked last season, and another thing all the clubs finishing above us had.

Well, you could look at the history of comedy.  Would it satisfy you if I could give you a list of important stand-up comics who have explored taboo subjects as part of their acts?   Wouldn't the onus then be on you to demonstrate that these comics were wrong?

Edit:  

* Bill Hicks  (Critic of capitalism, religion.)

* Sarah Silverman (Feminist)

* Richard Pryor ( Perhaps the greatest stand-up comic of all time.)

* Louis CK (Lot of anti-racist material.)

* Chris Rock (Another anti-racist)

* Lenny Bruce (Don't know much about him.  But a very famous stand-up.)

* Mel Brooks (Not familiar with his stand-up, but The Producers/Blazing Saddles were grossly offensive to some.  Anti-fascist.  Anti-racist.)

* Joan Rivers (Paved the way for female stand-up.)

I could probably go on, but whatever.

Id say go with them but be careful who you talk to on the phone, if they sound happy there's an issue.

Everyone that works there that seems bored in my experience will be more polite and will actually tell the truth.



I had an accident last year where I fucked up going round a corner I rang up to ask for breakdown then got told by 2 **happy** people that I had it and it will be there within 30 minutes. 1 hour later I rang up and asked where it was, the person on the phone didn't sound happy and she told me I don't have breakdown and no one can come to me.


After telling them to leave it they came during the night and took the bike from where I stored it over night and told me I had to pay to get it out of storage. 

They put a claim on my insurance for this and got told by 10 people I could have it removed and that they will do it for me.

Only last week I got told it's on there for 5 years.

I do work for the government, in the criminal justice field.  So what?  That doesn't make my criticism of your ""investigation"" any less valid.

&gt; Yes I am largely a legal layman, but everyone has to start somewhere.

What you're suggesting isn't ""starting"".  You're basically saying you don't know any of the theory that teaches you what makes detention lawful or unlawful, but you still want to get right to the actual practice of making that determination without any of the grounding knowledge.  People spend years earning degrees and then a lifetime earning experience to do the kind of thing you're suggesting, and you're arrogant enough to assume that you will be able to just waltz into a prison, look down a list of prisoners, and go ""unlawful!"" and be correct about it?

&gt; I don't agree that legal laymen should be deterred from an interest in the working of the legal system because it is supposedly beyond them to understand its workings unless they undergo years of specialised training and education

Absolutely not, but again, what you're suggesting isn't ""an interest"".  What you are effectively saying is that you feel that you will be able to go into a prison, look at the prisoner list, look at the evidence in the case, and *without any legal knowledge*, will be able to find fault in the judgements of experts with a lifetime of experience.  That is exceptionally arrogant.

&gt;  the ruling classes largely believed the working classes were too ignorant to understand politics to have a vote.

The fact that it was a bad idea to restrict suffrage to so-called ""experts"" doesn't mean that it is *automatically always a good idea* for laymen to turn their hand to anything they choose, or that laymen are automatically better at it than experts.

&gt; in this way it would be possible for someone to check if detentions were lawful.

Yes!  Someone who knew the difference between lawful and unlawful detention - i.e. someone other than you.

&gt; A better analogy perhaps might be: if I were to go round snooping for a complete list of all individuals and companies who have donated money to the Conservative Party in the run up to the recent election. As a political laymen, someone without a degree in politics, should I be prevented from finding out this information too? 

There is an enormous difference between judging which numbers are bigger than others on a sheet of accounts, and judging whether a particular detention fits the criteria for legitimacy.  The scale of complexity in your analogy is completely off; mine better encapsulates the actual complexity of what you're talking about.

Another analogy is practising medicine without knowing any of the theory behind it.  Or trying to become a solicitor or barrister without ever having studied law.

&gt; but I have to say, I believe you are naive to believe this right cannot be abused, if it is not being so abused already.

You have no evidence of that whatsoever besides your own juvenile automatic distrust of authority.  Don't call me naive based on the fact that I do not share your automatic mistrust.

What's worse is that you are so certain that the system *must* be corrupt, you feel that you will just be able to walk in and find all these horrific miscarriages of justice, and you're so unshakeably assured of your own monumental intelligence that you feel you'll be able to do it without any legal training at all, finding errors in the work of lesser mortals who have dedicated their lives to the profession. Your entire attitude is obnoxious and wrong.

&gt; So, for example, in America

And, for example, in Saudi Arabia, thieves have their hands cut off.  That doesn't mean it's happening here. You're talking about two totally different systems, which are completely closed and isolated from one another. For that reason you cannot give evidence of corruption in the US and use it to prove corruption in the UK.

&gt; But it can be difficult to guarantee the fundamentals of Magna Carta, if you don't know who is held in prison and on what legal basis.

You keep talking about the Magna Carta as if it's an entrenched piece of primary legislation, like the US Constitution or the Basic Law of Germany.  In fact, in the UK we have a concept called ""parliamentary sovereignty"".  We have no entrenched legislation; the Magna Carta, like all other legislation passed by the UK government (or its predecessors), can be repealed by a simple majority vote with the passage of new legislation by Parliament.  Each new Parliament can undo the work of any and all previous Parliaments.

null,false,gin0clock,null,null,null,"Bacca is just as much a gamble as Benteke. 28, relatively high wages and because of his age he would only get 1 season to impress, otherwise he'll be shipped off again in a year's time. But I think he'd have an immediate impact if he did hit the ground running, he certainly fits the profile and he's never scored (sparing 1 season) less than 12 goals in a campaign. But Â£21million for a guy we might only get 2/3 decent seasons out of is a risk.

Berahino &amp; Austin both impress me more than Benteke. I'll start with Austin. I don't think Charlie Austin is all that great, but he scored 18 goals in the league last year in a QPR side that were nothing short of rocket-wank. 3 of those were penalties, but the rest were (for the most part) actually decent goals. He's not the quickest, he's not as good in the air as Benteke, but Austin can press and he's got a lot more to offer than QPR let him. 

But if we're going to buy into the premier league proven crap that everyone keeps talking about, Berahino would be our best bet in the long term. 21 years old, playing for a team who (like QPR) were complete rocket-wank. This 21 year old scored 20 times in 45 matches, he's got an abundance of pace and has an impressive pass completion percentage of 83% (Benteke on 66%, Austin on 67%) that speaks volumes about him technically in my opinion. 4 of his goals this season were penalties, but that still puts him on 16 goals excluding penalties (Benteke on 12, Austin on 15) - also worth mentioning that Berahino played all 38 games for WBA this year, so his fitness isn't an issue at all. He's got a lot to learn, but statistically, Berahino is head and shoulders above both Austin and Benteke. Worth nothing that Berahino's agent is Aidy Ward.

Aleksander Mitrovic is a cheaper, younger version of Benteke. Scored 27 in 50 for Anderlecht this season, stays fit, has a wealth of potential. Franco Di Santo has 14 in 28 for Werder Bremen this season, he's been immense for the German club and has really come of age since joining them.

My personal pick from Europe would be Andriy Yarmolenko. He's not a striker, but I bet he'd bloody love to be. He and Konoplyanka are the best players at Dynamo Kiev, but Yarmolenko is on a different level all together. He's 26, 6 foot 2, has a ridiculous return of 19 goals and 21 assists this season for Kiev and that's been from out wide. I would guess that he plays in a deeper role because Kiev would be screwed without him in midfield, however he'd kill it in the center forward role. The thought of having Firmino, Coutinho &amp; Yarmolenko in our starting 11 does some weird things to me. edit: **also his contract expires in 2016**

null,false,Bobsled_team,lfc68,,null,"What Sterling offers, good running on the ball, pace, flashes of pure class, but generally a poor end product, simply isn't that much to replace in a side. With Henderson, Coutinho, and now Firmino, we've got plenty of players with the ability to pick out a pass. 

It's not as if Sterling looked a world beater from his first appearance, and I see no reason to believe we don't have players with the capability to reach Sterlings level given a run in the team. 

Of course Ibe isn't near Sterling's level yet, but he's got pace, consistently takes on players, and an absolute cannon of a shot. With Coutinho, Firmino, Lallana, and hopefully another first-team quality forward, we have the players to take on Sterling's responsibility and keep the pressure off Ibe (Markovic?) as he develops.

I like Markovic and think he could really make an impact this season but I'm afraid he's going to be lost in the noise, which would be a shame. Similarly, I don't know what to expect from Origi and am not really expecting anything at all to begin with, but he certainly has the physicality to be great in the pl.

FPTP is objectively a terrible system for anything other than a simple binary choice.  
Regardless of who wins, it guarantees that at least 50% of the votes are wasted, and causes people to become disenfranchised with the voting process.

And it's not just the loser's votes. Over a third of the wasted votes around here were actually conservative.

Suppose you live in a safe seat, with the votes as follows:

null,false,chunkgns,lfc99,,null,"Â£50m is a lot of money. Let me get that out of the way.  But here's my argument why it isn't enough.

What happens if he finally learns to be a prolific scorer? Most goalscorers don't mature til their mid 20s and he's shown great tactically awareness and development.  Imagine if he learns how to finish? I'm clearly a fan of keeping him even if he's unhappy.

Also as The Anfield Wrap recently outlined, Â£50m isn't financially the same as a straight, normal Â£50m transfer, when you consider the following if we kept him to his contract for two more seasons:
1- we would be paid a development fee (for being under 24) which could be significant (~Â£10-15m especially if he continues to stay fit and earn England caps)
2- 20% of the fee goes to QPR (so Â£50m only nets us Â£40m)
3 - since he's earning Â£35k/week, and probably should be closer to Â£100k/week, we're saving approximately Â£7m (Â£65k/week for 2 more seasons)
4 - after the 2 seasons, he still probably leaves but you never know what can happen

So if he stays, we get (#1)/save(#3) at least Â£15-20m in fee/wages. And if we sell now for Â£50m, we only keep Â£40m and lose out on a great young player.

A few times, because I only looked at ONE video from ONE season. You are grasping at straws. Plus, Sturridge is really good in the air. Why are you trying to argue otherwise? We play less balls that way, but that does not make him any less capable.

&gt;it's very uncharacteristic for Liverpool fans to bash one of our young stars

You have that mixed up. It's very uncharacteristic of Liverpool's young stars (or any players) to give unauthorised interviews to the BBC where they basically slate the club and say they want to leave.

Once a player makes it clear he wants to move (and move to a rival such as City or Arsenal - not to somewhere outside of England) you can't blame fans for not supporting them. The player isn't supporting the club when they do that. 
Sterling and his agent just haven't handled this with class or respect.

Compare him to someone like Coutinho who has handled himself impeccably and declared his love for the club.

A) It means we'll probably go another season without playing with one, especially if Lucas gets injured again...and our defense is way too shaky to cope without one.

B) Putting Can there is such a complete waste of his talents. He should be bang in the middle of the park, with the freedom to barge forwards with the ball, competing with Hendo and Milner for time. Get a strong DM as proper competition for Lucas for once. I love Lucas, but he's too injury prone to rely on and every single player in the squad could do with a kick up the backside and some competition for places.

We need to stop being scared of having two excellent choices for each position.

I think to a large and often underappreciated extent, the success of our entire season comes down to that. If we don't get a strong presence in there, we'll just keep leaking like a broken tap...as we have done for ages now. Been thinking a lot about Rodgers vs Benitez and we've just seen two completely separate philosophies from them.

Rafa built a ridiculously strong squad from back to front. We had some magnificent defenders and between 2004-2007, we slowly improved from back to front, eventually getting the likes of Torres to spearhead attacks. But we spent the first couple of seasons with a chronically injured Cisse, a slightly better-than-average Baros and later, a slow-starting Crouchy (who turned into a legend once he finally started scoring). But in the intervening time we had a brilliant defence and covered our lack of world-class forwards until Fernando came along. That defensive solidarity stayed throughout and only got better until 2009 when Sami (and Xabi) left.

Rodgers, on the other hand, seems to be the polar opposite. I don't remember conceding as many as we did in 2013-14 as any other point in my memory, and we (EDIT: **ALMOST**) won the league by seemingly completing ignoring defence and hoping we'd outscore the opposition. Fortunately, SAS were on fire and we never really had to go a match without at least one of them. I don't think I've ever seen a manager of such a large club be so blasÃ© about the defensive side of the game. I genuinely sometimes wonder if Rodgers gaves a crap about it. Three years we've had to get a DM to cover/compete with Lucas, who's been injured for most of that time. Three years with nothing and it's been staring everyone in the face for all that time that we'd concede so much less if we just put a strong fucking body in front of the back 4 who actually is supposed to be there, rather than using Gerrard, Can, Allen, etc to fill in there when they should all be further forward. Last year we suffered because we no longer had the two world class forwards to rely on to dig us out of the holes we dig for ourselves, unlike 2013-14. I'd definitely prioritise a DM and better defensive coaching than even another striker. If we didn't get Benteke, Bacca, etc, but managed to somehow find a DM to help us out, I wouldn't be too disappointed, as I think we'd manage to scrape out wins we weren't able to last season.

2) See this video of Defoe giving space to Bale by dragging the defender with him https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGMT2nJ5jOM

3) And here is a link where Borini is making the run. Sorry to post this link! http://192ft2.blogspot.com/2013/01/movement-off-ball.html ( We lost the game 3-2). But, you can look at movement by Borini.

None of thes are offered by Benteke from what I have seen! 

 Adding to it, if you watched FA cup finals - Benteke was very poor. Villa couldn't get forward with Arsenal dominated midfield. That meant Benteke was dropping deep. Now, here's where you see his work rate. Slow in possession and off the ball a complete statue!. His pass percentage was very poor with 63%.

I'm sick of hearing about a 'Liverpool style' to be honest. Benteke's movement is good. He's not Ings, Sturridge, Defore movement good. But we already have 2 of those players, 3 if you count Origi. 

Lambert did do decently, but he was too slow and old to keep up. Benteke is young and quick and would thrive with 2 Brazilians feeding balls onto his head or in behind. 

Balotelli doesn't work because he's Balotelli. If he actually had a good attitude he could no doubt be good for us. He doesn't have the mentality to succeed.

You may have seen me defend Benteke time and time again on here as it has happened. You should probably realise then I'm getting a bit fed up of explaining why over and over and over again. 

One of my friends (he's actually a family friend) is a Villa season ticket holder and is baffled where all this tripe about his lack of movement comes from. 

Are you kidding me with bringing up the FA cup final as an example though? As an out and out striker why am I not surprised he didn't grab the ball like Messi and win the cup himself for Villa? Because that's not his job.

He is a classic forward. You feed them, they score. Clearly Rodgers and the committee have decided against having technicians in every bloody position and have actually decided to put a proper forward into our plans.


I'll be very happy with signing him as long as we use him right, and I'm choosing to believe we will as all of our targets upfront have been predators. Bacca, Benteke and Rondon all absolute predators. I'd imagine we have a plan in mind for them.

 Let's not go into subject how that is already massive amount of money most of us can only dream of, but, even when you compare him with other players, you cannot tell me he is being offered a contract in which he deserves to earn more.

 Muller is paid 85k. Does a 20 year old who isn't a world beater by any means, nor is he Suarez-like figure who truly seems outstanding and to turn a game on his own, deserves to earn 65k more than Muller (the guy who scored most goals on WC 2010)?

 Does he really deserves to earn 45k more than Neuer (best GK in the world)?

 Does he really deserves to earn SAME as Neymar?

 Does he really deserves to earn TWICE as much as Rakitic?

 Does he really deserves to earn TWICE as much as Pogba who was earning about 15k a week until few months ago?

 And just to imagine, if he thinks he is worth 150k a week while playing just above average in team with 20 years old, could you imagine how much he would ask if he becomes just a little bit better.

No just like no one think it's good business selling Sterling to a direct rival (City) unless we can get Â£50m from them. 

&gt;Does anyone actually think that Sterling will be a difference maker for a team with City's quality? Does anyone actually think he'll live up to his Â£50 million price tag?

Sterling is a pretty good upgrade on Navas so he could actually upgrade that City team by quite a bit, and since he's only 20 he should only get better. He wont live up to that Â£50m price tag within a season, no player can do that. It's a long term thing surely

&gt;Suarez could have walked into the starting XI for any team in Europe. Sterling can't even maintain a starting role for us. Do you REALLY think this is the right comparison to be making?

Huh, even with him being awful for the last 3 months we didn't even drop him except for the very last game.. that should say something!

But anyway I'm not comparing Suarez's loss and Sterling's potential loss to the club, of course dealing with Sterling's should be easier. Good players are worth keeping as long as possible, Suarez is a good example of that. Using your original logic we would have sold him to Arsenal but instead we told them to fuck off, we didn't even try to negotiate afaik.

null,false,ViridianPanther,null,null,null,"1. Go to any Tube station and tell a member of staff you want to buy an Oyster card. You can usually do it from the machines but the staff will put you right. You pay for a deposit and an initial top up.
2. You put money on the Oyster card like a pay-as-you-go mobile. To top up, use the ticket machines.
3. You pay for travel as you go. When you're getting on a train, you plop the Oyster card on the yellow readers on the gates/validators at the start and end of your journey, and it works out the fare and deducts it from your balance. (On a bus and a tram, you only touch in at the start, when you get on the bus or on the tram platform.)
4. If you make enough journeys in one day, the cost is limited at the ""daily price cap"" for the zones you went through. (This is cheaper than a paper Travelcard.)

Caveats:
* **DO NOT FORGET TO TOUCH IN AND OUT.** If you don't touch in on the bus, tram or train, that is considered fare evasion, and if you're inspected and caught you could get a Penalty Fare, or be prosecuted.

* A touch-in/out was only successful if the light on the validator went green and the machine beeped once only. If it goes red and beeps twice, there's a problem. Ask for help.

* sometimes, to change between lines or modes, you might need to leave the station and go into another one. Touch out and in as normal: the system will usually recognise this as an ""out of station interchange"" and it will only charge you once.

* **KEEP YOUR OYSTER CARD SEPARATE FROM ALL YOUR OTHER CARDS.** If you have a contactless credit card you don't want that being read and charged by accident.",null,0,null,1435442478,null,0,1435447140,0,cskuwrd,null,t3_3bc129,null,t1_cskuwrd,null,t3_3bc129,null,null,null,1437399367,null,8,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,8,null

null,false,unholyarmy,null,null,null,"It has been severely hobbled in recent years as banks caught on. years ago the deal was 0% on balance transfers and little to no transfer fee, which meant you could effectively have all your monthly spending on the credit card and save the money you were going to pay off each month in a high interest savings account. 

Now high interest savings accounts are 3%-5% (if you go with a current account, or 1-2% if you are in a savings account) not thet 6-7% they used to be, and the banks apply a balance transfer fee which negates much of the gain you are making in interest. 

For instance, the longest one on the market at the moment is Tesco with a crazy long 23 month 0% period, but the balance transfer fee is 2.9% up front.

Now bear in mind, you are paying that fee after tax, and any interest rate quoted in a bank is before tax, so assuming you are a 20% tax payer, the cash related to spending you are deferring repayment of needs to go into an account paying 1.8% gross to break even. If you put it into a 3% account, you would make Â£19 for every Â£1000 on the credit card that is transferred. 

I have stated elsewhere that I would rather have Â£19 than not have it, but you cant make serious money stoozing like you used to. Your best bet with stoozing is if you have an offset mortgage which usually is costing you a higher interest rate than you are getting from savings, and so putting the money in there effectively saves you that larger interest rate, but the balance transfer fees have still put a huge damper on the whole deal.

No it isn't strange at all. That's just absurd. Chrome will not allow any app to alter the content of a webpage without the user giving this permission. The reason it has this system in place is so that an extension which clearly should not be altering webpages, will not be permitted to do so, and so that its malicious behaviour might be caught out by the user.

&gt;How old is the National Lottery


no idea - about 20 years? 25?

&gt;--is it a private or public (state) institution? If it's public, will it ever be a privately owned entity?

Private - sent out to tender isn't it, hence Camelot
&gt;Do you think they fund enough charity work?


they seem to do quite a bit, I often seem to see that things have lottery funding.

&gt;Who do you think gambles more--the rich, middle class, or poor/working class?

The people who have no money  - it's not called the 'poor tax' for nothing

&gt;How do you feel about the National Lottery in general?

&gt; However, it said heâd prefaced those comments with an ironic introduction, joking that they would illustrate what a âchauvinist monsterâ he was. The report then revealed the existence of an entire second half of the controversial toast. In it, Sir Tim was said to have told his audience that his remark about âmaking them cryâ was, indeed, an ironic joke. He purportedly said, ânow seriously . . .â before going on to speak enthusiastically about the âimportant roleâ women scientists play. He ended by joking that his largely female audience should pursue their trade, âdespite monsters like meâ.


And while the point about the book scholarship was indeed weak, what do you say about the rest of the apparent lies in her CV?

&gt; Here, on a page outlining her CV, she is described as follows: (...) âShe presents and produces a range of programmes for BBC Radio 4 and BBC World Service . . . She writes for numerous outlets, including The Independent, Daily Mail, The Guardian, The Sunday Times, BBC On Air magazine and BBC Online.â ...

&gt; For one thing, Connie St Louis does not âpresent and produceâ a range of programmes for Radio 4. Her most recent work for the station, a documentary about pharmaceuticals called The Magic Bullet, was broadcast in October 2007. For another, itâs demonstrably false to say she âwritesâ for The Independent, Daily Mail and The Sunday Times.

&gt; In an early passage, she for example writes: âI am a regular contributor to ABC News Worldview TV programme.â Yet ABC News Worldview has not aired for roughly five years. Factiva, an online search engine which carried transcripts of it, suggests that the last recorded contribution by Connie St Louis to the show was on May 31, 2006.

&gt; Elsewhere in the six-page CV is a section devoted to âQualification and Trainingâ. In it, St Louis trumpets the fact that she is âa member of the Royal Institutionâ. Again, very prestigious. Or so it seems, until a spokesman for the Royal Institution told me: âAnyone can be a member. Itâs simply a service you pay for which entitles you to free tickets to visit us and gives you a discount in our cafe. âItâs like having membership of your local cinema or gym.â

The way to respond to this isn't to share Daily Mail articles and retweet Richard Dawkins  (forming a potentially uglier internet mob) but to listen to what the activists are saying, recognise the importance of a debate about women in science but to politely point out the inconsistencies based on evidence.

Yeah I was solely looking at those stats.

Yep more shots per game 80 shots this season, but as his accuracy is 45% and so only 36 of those shots have any chance of going in. Whereas with 69 shots and a much better 71% accuracy Bacca has 49 shots on target. So effectively 13 more useful shots this season. I'd take a striker who knows where the goal is in preference that just aims vaguely near it. That he's scored more also doesn't hurt ;) I know some were penalties but we've lost our main penalty taker and wouldn't hurt to have a new one unless Hendo is dead set on it.

We don't tend to put headable crosses in all that often other than at set pieces so Benteke scoring more from headers doesn't interest me much. We do get lots of set pieces and Bacca gets goals from lots of those. 

I'll take assists over key passes and chances tbh, though I know it can be argued that maybe the people he was supplying made more than the ones Benteke was. 6 assists over 2 is enough for me though

Higher interceptions, blocks and clearances suggests he offers more for getting the ball back and breaking up attacks. Presume clearances is defending set pieces so that seems particularly useful despite his lower height.

Unlike Benteke Bacca hasn't been sent off so at least seems to pace the bad tackles he got half his yellows for.

It's of course worth noting that at no point did Britain seriously try diplomacy as a solution, shown by the fact that at no point during the conflict was their direct British-Argentinian dialogue.

But that is all neither here nor their. The simple fact is, the idea that the military is their to defend ordinary people's freedoms is a nonsense. Even a cursory glance at any scholarly writing on the subject will tell you that that isn't the case, and this is even from people that are hugely pro-military.

Bukhari (52:220) is this not an account and not an order?

&gt; Allah's Apostle said, ""I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with terror (cast in the hearts of the enemy), and while I was sleeping, the keys of the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my hand."" Abu Huraira added: Allah's Apostle has left the world and now you, people, are bringing out those treasures (i.e. the Prophet did not benefit by them).

And in recent times his performances have deteriorated as drastically as his attitude and unless you're truly elite like world-class like Suarez or Marco Reus you're not worth ""a LOT more than 100k"", especially if you're willing to create such unnecessary trouble for the club and not give your all for the shirt. If he wants to go he can fuck right off. He is not our 2nd best player, arguably or not, Sturridge is our best player as he is unplayable when fit and injuries don't change that, and Coutinho is much, much more talented than Sterling. Sterling can beat 3 men on the dribble and run himself into a corner and lose the ball. Everything Coutinho does has a purpose, as Suarez said so himself. He doesn't lose the ball, and doesn't take that many shots but when he does they're stunning. 

Balotelli was Italy's starting striker at the time and a fixture in the Milan team. He had scored 26 goals in 43 games for Milan and had a big reputation, albeit a crazy one, but that meant that he commanded big wages. Yes it turned out to be a mistake but that was a risk the board was willing to take. 100k a week for a 20 year old is absolutely INSANE money. Ronaldo wasn't earning that at 20. How many 20 year olds in the world make that? Not even 1%. He had a starting spot in our first team, the offer of 100k a week, staff and teammates who made him who he is today, and the admiration of just about everyone in the world who regarded him as one of the best young players in the world. If he wants to turn that all down to go and play for a rich club where transfer records are broken regularly and players come and go just as much as the fans do and be another brick in a wall of superstars that's his choice, maybe it's a smart choice on his part, but you CANNOT expect us to continue supporting him for it. He is NOT worth 50million and we already have a better replacement in Firmino and players like Lallana and Ibe who are willing to fight for their place in the team, not complain , and give their all for the shirt.

As a new Spurs fan I'm not sure when the last time a starting XI from the previous season all came back the next. But that continuity may be vastly underrated. Man United will have a lot of turnover again. Liverpool looks ridiculous now. Chelsea and Man City remain strong and the scum remain consistent. With Poch, a full pre-season, our young talent, consistent starting XI we may have a team who legitamely can battle for top 4. The BIG name guys that always want Champions league football, may not want us yet. But we may not need them to get there.

Building depth and consistency, so far. If we splash for a solid CDM sometime in this window, I think it's a success beyond anything I hope for. If not, we shored up our back line (especially if we get Toby) found a solid pacey backup for Kan (if we get Kono) and hopefully some more cover at CDM.

People keep saying that no, we don't need pure DMs, players like Joe Allen or Milner can play as a ""holding midfielder"". Have people even seen our defensive record? It's not because our backline is that shit, Sakho and Skrtel are solid defenders who if given proper protection, are quite capable of keeping clean sheets. 

I am of the opinion that a large part of our failures in the 14/15 season was the decision to play Stevie as a deep-lying midfielder or holding midfielder or whatever they call defensive mids who can't defend. He's my favourite player of all time but although his passing and set piece ability remained, his lack of pace and defensive positioning got us caught out time and time again. Take [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1IDO3qEd6s) for example. Stevie completely loses Ronaldo and allows him to gallop through the gap in the CBs to score. People will blame those goals on the CBs for letting strikers score but if Gerrard had continued marking Ronnie he would NOT have gotten through so easily. I mean, it's RONALDO, you don't just stop marking him.

I am of the firm belief that we have missed a player of Mascherano's mould for a long time. Lucas is injured too much to really fill his boots. Masch was aggressive, tenacious and would tackle anything that moved, and what allowed him to do that was also an amazing positional sense. He was also willing to play a bit dirty and commit fouls when they absolutely needed to be committed. Not saying they should go out breaking ankles but football is a man's game and players like Allen and Hendo are simply too nice to the opposition. They don't strike fear into their hearts and make them avoid them. Opposing strikers would avoid Mascherano's vicinity like the plague and it gave their team less space and options. 

Enough of this deep-lying playmaker, Illaramendi bullshit. We have players like Lallana, Firmino, Coutinho, Markovic, Ibe, all whose job it is to create attacks and plays, plus Hendo and Milner helping out. We need a defensive midfielder who actually DEFENDS. I'd be OK with Rodgers trying Emre out in the DM position but I really want to see a real destroyer brought in.

null,false,threejoinedrings,null,null,null,"There's an Assembly election next year which will change the make-up of the Assembly (albeit probably only slightly). In the most recent motion vote, there was only 2 votes off a majority, although a DUP Petition of Concern would have blocked it anyway, however when it moves into getting a majority vote then there is a much stronger push as it shows a majority in favour and just DUP blocking democracy. That means either changing the minds of the SDLP absentees and Alliance abstainers, or electing more pro-equal marriage candidates from the other parties who are completely in favour (SF, Green Party, NI21 and PUP are the parties that have consistently kept whip/policy and supported the issue, including on council motion votes, as far as I'm aware) . So that would get it into majority territory at least, making the DUP look a hell of a lot worse when they pull out a PoC against it. If the DUP lose 9 seats then they lose their Petition of Concern control overall, since you need 30 members to sign a PoC and they have 38 - it's very unlikely they'd lose that much, but it's an outside chance and although people from other parties could sign their PoC, they might not be so inclined to in the face of the amount of bad press they'd get. So that might allow the Assembly to make their first pro-LGBTQ rights decision in their history.

But, assuming that doesn't happen, there's a legal case going through challenging it, that looks like it has a chance of succeeding. Unfortunately, it could be subject to a bunch of appeals afterwards, like the blood ban, which will cost tax-payers' money and also probably mean that equal marriage remains unrecognised in Northern Ireland while it happens.

And then there's the possibility that Westminster step in and tell the Assembly to wise the fuck up. I think this is really unlikely and even under direct rule, I doubt they'd do it, unless there really was a massive campaign directly targeting Westminster to change the law. It's possible that if there were reason to believe that public opinion was in support, and given our law being out of step with the rest of the UK, that they might be inclined to do it to try to win the favour of the people - and it could potentially even look good as a ""cross-community"" issue in that SF are the biggest party supporting equal marriage, so Westminster giving them a law against the DUP's opinions would be interesting.

null,false,B23vital,null,null,null,"Having seen Kanye twice live, im extremely conflicted. 
I Absolutely loved most of it, typical Kanye being a perfectionist. People complained about him stopping tracks half way through, but thats Kanye. He wants you to have the full experience, a perfect experience, thats what you paid for, thats what you wanted, thats what you get with Kanye. Any real fan knows this, he has done it multiple times on tour. 
Secondly, i loved the atmosphere he created, there isn't many people that can come out, with very little fan interaction, alone, and create that atmosphere. I loved the cherry picker, the crowd ate that shit up, they went insane and it was great. 
He is a massive crowd pleaser and he gave the crowd exactly what they wanted which is what he aims to do! 
On the other hand however, i found the track choices a bit strange, the stage set up, although it was quality, very simplistic, it didn't feel very Kanye West. He is usually extravagant, going all out to do something different and really make a show of it. I'd imagine this however was due to the fact it was a one of show, it wasn't an album tour, wasn't based on a story, so in that sense it sort of fitted. Id imagine this is also why there was so many fuck ups, due to the lack of practice. Its only noticeable because Kanye doesn't avoid it, he rectifies it. 
I still think it was an amazing show, real master piece but it has nothing on his tours, just watch 5 minutes of his latest Yeezus Tour. Also, try his Watch The Throne tour, you can see the real effort and dedication put into these. 

On another note, what the fuck are the Glastonbury Security playing at. Seriously that was fucked up allowing someone to get on stage, that could of ruined it, and for me was disgusting. They were also extremely slow to remove him! Kanye handled it like an absolute pro fortunately. 
Also those people with the green laser pens are a disgrace, they have been continually harassing acts with them laser pens. Noticed it last night on Florence and the Machine &amp; it was worse tonight for Kanye.  Cant imagine how off putting them things are, they are extremely bright, especially at night and just ruin the experience for those watching.

We'll never know who's going to supplant who and who may or may not turn out to be flops until the season begins. For all we know, Trippier and Wimmer might become our worst transfers in a while, though unlikely.

&gt; But that continuity may be vastly underrated

I feel like people here use this excuse too much to justify our shitty transfer window when we sold Bale. We bought a lot of players and many of them turned out to be shit. The same season, Moyes bought just Fellaini and then Mata in the winter window and they still had a shit season.

Point is, consistency is important, but overrated. 

&gt; With Poch, a full pre-season, our young talent, consistent starting XI we may have a team who legitamely can battle for top 4.

You're going to be thoroughly disappointed. I would love to be proven wrong but there's no way in hell we get Top 4 unless we win EL, which is looking just as unlikely. Just because we love showing off how we have the youngest average squad in the league, it doesn't necessarily translate into performances now.

&gt; Building depth and consistency

The only reason why we're still stuck building ""depth"" and ""consistency"", as you put it, is because we are paying for the shortcomings of our terrible transfer window.

And consistency isn't necessarily a good thing. Each player needs to know they are not undroppable, such as how we suspect Rose felt the same when we brought Davies.

Well, once again, right now, it's Islam which is causing the lion's share of the problems.  I admit you can always find some problems caused by Christians and Jews, but that doesn't change the fact that Islam is currently the biggest threat.

&gt;Religion is not inherently bad or wrong, it can cause good charitable acts even within Islam, but it is far too easy for the wrong people to twist it as such.

Well maybe, but that STILL doesn't change the fact that Islam is currently the biggest problem.  We could argue forever about whether Islam has been twisted or whether its inherently bad, but at the end of the day, does it really matter?  The fact is that Islam, as it is practiced, has become a threat.

------------------

Edit:  OK you edited your comment to add a last paragraph.  I'll respond to that now:

&gt;I am also going to add that suggesting Islam alone is the problem alienates those that follow Islam that do no wrong. 

Yeah - I don't care.  Sorry, but the fact that a billion people believe in some nonsense doesn't mean that I should refrain from calling it nonsense.  And if I think that nonsense has become dangerous then I think I should also be justified in saying that.  People get their feelings hurt?  So be it.  


&gt;Suggesting that the religion they follow is inherently evil just because a few people do evil acts in the name of that religion follows the same logic as calling all christians evil because of the evil acts caused hundreds of ears ago.

Um, I haven't said that Islam is inherently evil.  Please debate me on things I've actually said as opposed to those things you think I might say.  And no, criticizing a religion as dangerous is not the same thing as calling the followers of that religion evil.  (I don't think that muslims or Christians are evil.)

&gt;Remember, most of those killed today in the bombing in Kuwait were Islamic, calling their religion alone evil as they died praying for their religion is simply wrong. 

I never called their religion evil.  You made that up.  Neither did I say that Islam is the only religion with problems.

Sure, the largest number of victims from Islam are Muslim, but how does that change anything?  Should I be nicer to Islam because muslims are dying in Islamic violence?  Is Islam less of a threat if it's Muslims who are mostly dying in terrorist attacks?

I am not saying outright that the squad we have now is of the caliber of a Top 4 team. I realize for this team to make the next step our players will have to. Lamela will need to improve, Chadli will need to improve, Eriksen will need to not dissapear for games, the defensive consistency must be better. These are obvious and by no means things that are simple tasks to accomplish.

However, barring the CDM position we wouldnt be going  for top caliber players in other positions anyways. You wouldn't bring a striker who was better than Kane. You wouldn't bring in a creative number 10 when you have a 23 year old Eriksen. You wouldnt splash the bank on a CB who could crash and burn like Mangala did for City. Walker is a Top premier league RB so you wouldn't waste money bringing in someone like Clyne. An argument could be made for winger, with possibly us getting Depay if we are a Champions league team. But that's about it.

With the team we have this type of window, is the path forward. I think most Spurs fans are aware we are all in with Kane and Eriksen. They make this team tick and how far we go will depend on them. 

I have only seen one season of Spurs football. But I saw every game last year. And I saw a team that started out with no identity. I made it to the Stoke game at the Lane and as I left i told my longtime Spurs supporter friend who recruited me ""this is a mid-table team at best"". But after that game the team seemed to rally around there coach and young star striker. Not to mention the return of Walker who changed everything. 

The Spurs need someone to emerge next season for them to make top 4 no doubt. But last season Rose emerged, Bentaleb emerged, Mason emerged (maybe not as a starter but as consistent and able), and Kane emerged. To ask for one big step from players who have the potential to make it such as Lamela. Is not unreasonable. It may be hopeful. But not unreasonable. 

As for competition, last year there we had two positions that literally left us with no options for replacement. LCB and RB. Those were are first two signings. All other positions at least had someone who could get plugged in. Whether they were great or not there was a body. 

In the end I will take our position over Liverpool's. Young hugry players who want to stay and an unextravagant window. Over young players looking to leave and big purchases to fill holes.",null,0,null,1435458942,null,0,false,0,csl2gxu,null,t3_3bcwsp,null,t1_csl2gxu,null,t1_csl1qec,null,null,null,1437404485,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

I agree that so far we've been good. It's nice to see two players of starting XI quality in for very little money before the window is even technically open. Getting me quietly confident about the upcoming season.

I think Januzaj is quality but with Deulofeu and Mirallas I wouldn't be inclined to start him so I'm not sure how useful a transfer he'd be. Would be happy with him but not too disappointed if we missed out.

I'd like to keep Mirallas. He's a quality player and our retention of our best players has been really good recently.

I think this is my biggest problem actually.  Last off season we improved our ""squad depth"", without actually buying anyone who could improve the starting XI, except Dier, who I don't think anyone expected to become a starter in his first season.

We've just come off a disappointing campaign, salvaged only by Kane having a brilliant one, and I think we need to be realistic that it's unlikely he'll have a season go as smoothly again.

So considering the team haemorrhaged badly in defence, and struggled to create up front, I think we BADLY need to supplant a good deal of our starters.  Trippier and Wimmer may well end up being terrific first teamers, but they also may not.  We need at the very least a new starting CB, CDM, RW/LW, plus a backup striker and backup CAM because Kane and Eriksen sure as hell can't perform all season in every competition.

We're not even close to being a top 4 team at the moment in either personnel or playing style, and I think we'll require both Poch and his transfer dealings to step up big time before the end of August in order to be competitive again.

null,false,NeuroBill,null,null,null,"&gt; Why do you think because of great expense (both financially and in terms of loss of life) that it is unlikely we were protecting freedoms? I think it's because you're desperate to portray the Armed Forces as unneeded.

Because if you kill 1000, and severely injure nearly another 2000 people to ""protect the freedom"" of 1800 people, it doesn't make any sense.

I mean, I can't believe you're arguing this. The Falklands war was 100% a show of British might. I mean, the British KNEW that the Argintinians were withdrawing after the invasion. And they moved to attack before the withdrawal took place. They did that because they knew there was literally no way a bankrupt Argintina could win. They were in a position of massive superiority. They attacked rapidly and violently to show that the British Armed Forces were still a world power, and that any tin pot shit hole should think twice. That is what is was for, and it really surprises me that anyone would argue otherwise. And it probably didn't hurt that it distracted people while Thatcher was making large swathes of the country unemployed. After all, that is why the Argentinians did the invading in the first place.

But we're plainly not going to change each others minds. I think the notion that the military is there to ""protect the country"" and ""protect your freedoms"" is laughable. It's a completely modern invention. No one would have even suggested it 100 years ago. The British Navy was literally was invented to expand British power overseas. The majority of wars (and the majority of deaths) that the British military has suffered in the last 100 years have had nothing to do with protecting Britain or its freedoms. And if you do it just by conflicts then it is a VAST majority of that Britain has been involved in the last 100 years have had nothing to do with protecting the country or freedoms. The idea that the Military is there to protect your freedoms was invented after the second world war, and truly was a master stroke for military propaganda.

- I'd say that it's almost always better to get a card from the counter rather than a machine; from experience the machines aren't that common, as they're only available in certain stations. You can also ask the person at the counter if you have any questions
- if you're in London for a week+, it will be worthwhile to get a Zone pass. You can top up your Oyster on a machine, and when you do you can choose a weekly pass for the zones you frequent (e.g. Zone 1 &amp; 2 pass). You can travel as many times as you want through the specified zones in said time period (1 week, 1 month or 1 year). This may work out cheaper, or not, depending if hitting the price cap is more economical than a week pass.
- you can keep your Oyster to reuse at anytime, BUT if you've left it unused for a few years (like me...), you should go to the the counter and ask them to check if it still works. Chances are they need to update it
- at some stations the touch in &amp; out machine isn't super obvious. I guess for most people they can identify it, but because I live in Hong Kong and every station here has turnstyles that can only be passed through paying, it wasn't immediately obvious for me in some Overground stations that there was a touch in &amp; out machine (because there were no turnstyles). The big stations have the barriers/ doors that will open upon swiping your card, but some smaller stations only have 1 machine for you to swipe your card

That's all I can think of I guess?

Exactly my point about the sheep. With us or against us, that's what this sub is about. 

&gt;Crummy points based on nothing I have actually put forward. 

You've put forward a solid argument that Benteke will succeed. Despite not playing the style we played in our most successful season of the decade.

Also, answer these:

&gt; Running behind defenders. SuÃ¡rez, Sturridge, Benteke, Sterling. Pick out the odd one out.

&gt; The most successful season in about a decade, we play with 2 masters of movement. With a Passer who can thread a needle with his pass. All of sudden we sign another master of the pass and press. And people STILL think we will play to Bentekes strength? Massive, massive joke.

Their claim is that they were a Spanish colony who were granted freedom over their own lands, Argentina itself - which for some reason they took to mean the once Spanish controlled Falklands. The history of the Islands is quite long, with different colonies from England, France and Spain over the year, with a lot of hand overs. The short version of it was that it discovered by an English explorer, they were unsettled and this the first recorded settlement was made, a British colony, it was abandoned and eventually the Spanish got hold of it, lost it to the French who handed it to the English. Hundreds of years later a country that never even existed when the Falklands were contested claims a right to the Island for 'patriotic reasons' and because they found an old Spanish map of the islands.... they now demand the people who actually live there become Argentinian. I think most Brits will agree its not about having the Islands for any other reason that it's just. The people there have many chances at any point to become independent or even join Argentina, but time and time again the choose to stay apart of the UK crown dependencies. So when you call it Argentina's islands its an insult to freedom, democracy, international law and basic fucking human decency.

&gt;

&gt;__Veritas__ ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin): truth) was a [political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party) in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), formed in February 2005 by [Robert Kilroy-Silk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kilroy-Silk) following a split from the [UK Independence Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party) (UKIP). Kilroy-Silk served as party leader from formation, through the [2005 General Election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005), until his resignation in July that year. He was succeeded by Patrick Eston, who resigned the leadership on 15 June 2008 citing frustrations of his efforts to reform the party. Therese Muchewicz is the Party Leader.

&gt;Veritas has no representation in the [Parliament of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom), although it had a small number of members serve in the [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament) and the [London Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Assembly), elected as UKIP members and defecting upon Veritas' formation.

&gt;The party last put forward General Election candidates in 2005, although its leader Therese Muchewicz stood in [Bradford West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency\)) for the [English Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Democrats) under the name Therese Hirst in the 2015 General Election. She came last of the eight candidates with 98 votes.

The main reasons for selling a pub are Death, Divorce, Distress, Retirement and Bored.

If the seller isn't selling for Death, divorce and retirement (and they will lie).  There's something wrong.  

You NEED a verified copy of the accounts going back 5 years.  No accounts=little sales.

Don't walk in the door and say Hi I'm dead-yossarian I want to buy the pub, what's it like?  As you'll never see the real pub and the regulars may not talk to you.  Get some mates who know the trade to go in and look at it.  Especially at different times of the week.  Check out Monday afternoon 2-5, Mon 7-11, Thurs evening, Fri-Sat 12-4, 8-close, sun lunch, sun evening especially.  

Walk in there and tell the owner you want to buy the place straight off and you'll never find the truth.  You need to chat to the staff, locals.... as somebody completely disinterested in buying the place.  What are the good things, what are the bad things?  You can always say later to the owner that the pub was so nice that you wanted to buy it.  But sinking Â£x00,000+ into a business and then finding it's crap and can't be redeemed will probably bankrupt you.

As for good relations, trade with China is at an all time high now, which accelerated massively in recent years under the coalition government. They are trying to diversify the UK so that we aren't so dependent on the EU and US.

Also, the UK-China relationship is not too bad right now. We don't talk as much shit as the Americans, and we are happy trying to ride the rise of China (unlike the US who see them as a threat to their current dominance).

Look at the recent plans for the new Chinese central bank. The UK wants to get in at the ground level, and the US publicly scolded us for it!

The complains procedure has consisted of me being patronised and having the phone closed on me a few times. Actually managed to log a complaint and they came back (in a few hours) with the same snarky comments and no help at all. Haven't had a reply to my last 4 emails. Waiting for the suggested time to laps so I can go to the financial ombudsman. 

Even had excess protection. Read the TnCs on that very carefully. They have a few ways to avoid paying that as well. 

Being without a bike for 2 months (and probably a few months still) has squandered any savings I made by going with them. Please don't bother. You aren't really covered by them. I wouldn't go as far as calling it a scam but it's just not worth it.

*American Psycho* by Brett Easton Ellis - Jesus that's a fucked up book. I thought everybody was a serial killer for about a week afterwards. The rat thing didn't actually bother me that much though, in part because I'd heard it referred to so many times before and was expecting something horrific, but mostly because the book has been escalating for so long up to that point, it seems maybe a little bit obvious. It was incredibly compelling reading though.

*Catch 22* by Joseph Heller - I really liked the absurdism and the black humour and that method of storytelling that develops ideas rather than following events chronologically. I can see why people might not, especially with the distinct lack of closure, but it appealed to me. To each their own, I guess.

*The Language Wars* by Henry Hitchings - A non-fiction about the developing concept of 'proper' English. I found the second half revolving around more recent events more interesting than the first, which namechecked a few too many players and their works for me to feel like I was really keeping track of everything. I solid and interesting read on the whole though, if you're into that sort of thing.

Currently reading:

*Not that it Matters* by A. A. Milne - A collection of essays by the creator of Winnie-the-Pooh that was a gift from my arbitrary day santa. It was a good pick; it's entertaining and interesting, and the short length of each piece and the variation makes it great bedtime reading.

Up next:

*A Clockwork Orange* - I'm going to start it on the train to Leicester today.

Boy, was I mistaken. Actually, this was the first time I had visited the British seaside  so I've learned to adjust my expectations since then as  I had not realised that many British seaside towns were in such a state of disrepair.

The main one being their lack of testosterone, which is essentially a wonder hormone for all things physical. 

Women are also shorter on average, so smaller strides, which will make them slower. 

Women also have wider hips in general, which do not lend themselves well to running. Wider hips are also weaker hips, and can lead to injuries if trained too hard. 

This can be selected against, of course. Some women have naturally narrower hips. But now you're limiting your talent pool to women with narrow hips which is maybe 25% of the female population. Men with narrow hips are probably more like 90% of the male population. Bigger talent pool to draw from. 

VO2 Max (The maximum volume of oxygen a person can use) is also much higher in men. And it's not a trivial increase either. You're looking at 40-60% more..

You can train for it, but again.. Men just have the natural physiological advantage here.

I don't think we really need Kono either, to be honest I would prefer us to give Pritchard a chance to see what he can do he looked very energetic and was good running at defenders in the U21 world cup.

I would love us to sign James McCarthy at CDM, not only is it a realistic signing but I've heard reports he is considering leaving at he wants guaranteed first team football considering Everton have signed Cleverly, perhaps do a swap deal with Lennon plus cash. I think we should also sign Fabian Delph with a release clause of about Â£10M, Delph would be a realistic signing and willing to join.

Up front we need a quality striker. Kane was totally awesome last season but we do need some to replace either Adebayor or Soldado or both. I would Perez from Newcastle to join, a young striker with potential and fits in our price range. Additionally I think Beranino, Austin, Javier Hernandez or even Jordan Rhodes should be prospects and we should also consider Remy, he would bring a lot of pace up front and I think he can play right wing if needed but I'm unsure if he is willing to leave Chelsea for Tottenham just a rotation role.

Our culture is being eroded? Only an absolute ignoramus could suggest that. The Irish language, culture, sport and music are MORE popular and more widely used today than they have been in the last 200 years. Any book on the history of Ireland would tell you that: There has been a resurgence of Irish culture recently, not the opposite.2. Your ""implanted"" English idea: Do you think the Irish grew out of the ground? You better believe there were people here before the Celtic invasions happened and guess what? It was bloody and violent more often than not. What about the implanted Viking settlers? Do you hate the modern Danish as well for something that happened a millenium ago? 3. A foreign power owning ""our country,"" sure there's an argument but let me ask. What makes it our country? As I've already alluded to, the Celtic invasions took the land from the original neolithic settlers so it can be argued that we actually took their country going back and back until you find the original settlers who guess what? Were probably British lol, or French or whatever. The thing is, is that although the burning of the pope and tricolours is distasteful it's not something that can be correlated with the rest of your diatribe and you should make an effort to understand that any powerful nation with any grand ambitions would have done the same the British did. We would have done the same (and did) in the early 1000s Irish tribes raped and pillaged the entire Western coast of England, Wales and Scotland at a time they thought England was weak due to the recent Norman invasion of 1066. My point is that whilst this may have happened your seeming obsession with it fails to take in any nuances of the world and it's to your detriment, truly.",null,0,null,1435482052,null,0,false,0,csla35v,null,t3_3b6c6a,null,t1_csla35v,null,t1_csjg4qm,null,null,null,1437409851,null,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3,null

If only the Argeninians were prepared to take losses.  If they had said we will lose 20 Super Etendards to shoot down one Harrier, they'd have kept the Falklands.

If they had kept to their original time frame of invading the Falklands at the start of the Southern Hemisphere winter, they would have kept the Falklands.  The old Ark Royal would have been broken up, Illustrious would have been sold to the Australians, they would have received more Exocets from France, SSK Diesel Submarines from Germany and the weather would have been so bad that nobody could even have considered an invasion to retake the islands.  Instead the Argies developed a long game plan to start a provocation with Britain that involved landing scrap metal dealers on South Georgia.  Eventually this would in their opinion give them the moral right to invade The Falklands.  Instead shortly after the scrap metal dealers landed in South Georgia a British Submarine quickly left Gibralter the Argies thought that it was heading for them.  An SSN (Sub Surface Nuclear (Submarine)) in between Argentina and The Falklands would make an invasion of The Falklands impossible, every landing ship would be sunk.  So they brought forward the invasion by about 6 months at the start of the Southern Hemisphere Summer.  The Sub in question was responding to a completely different problem.

If you have another working solution you could sell it to any developed country for billions. Better yet get into politics and wow the political elite with your amazing never-before-seen ideas...

We already incentivize having children in a big way, but it's not going to be enough to support the government by itself. We need skilled immigrants who are culturally compatible and willing to integrate. A shrinking tax base and population would be bad for everyone, regardless of how many machines we have or what things we automate. 

That doesn't mean we should take in millions of unskilled ""refugees"" from Africa though. We want people that are net gains to the treasury, not net losses. EU migrants contribute a decent amount to our country overall but our non-EU migration system is a complete mess. We have the government limiting numbers of foreign students who tend to come here for a few years, spend a lot of their money and then either go home again or work in a highly paid job. Purely because of populism. They cost the state next to nothing but we are turning them away.

At the same time we seem to invite the (extremely large) extended families of a lot of non-EU migrants in without question, many of whom do not speak English and have no marketable skills at all. Then we have other cases where highly skilled, highly paid spouses of UK residents are unable to get into this country because of capital requirements..

Lets not even go into how we handle asylum seekers. We take far too long to process applications which makes it very difficult to deport people that are declined and increases the costs.
