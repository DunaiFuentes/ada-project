Plus the other overheads like tax, rent, wages, book keeper, etc.

But you could say that for *any* business. They all have overheads that vary from next to nothing, to expensive. JustEat is simply another one of those overheads.

null,null,volunteer24601,null,null,null,"A) They don't always view themselves as right-wing which is why some of them in some regions just wouldn't vote Tory (social stigma, old hatreds die hard) This is part of the reason UKIP were so successful, as folks who became disengaged from Labour found a new party that wasn't the Tories to vote for. However, as previously stated, I don't think Corbyn would bring them back at all - he is too much aligned with the radical urban liberal (pro-immigration) wing of the party. Kendall could but as we both agree, would lose the Corbyn-leaning voters. Out of the four I think Cooper is best suited to win them back . She has the right backround, grandaughter of a miner, from Yorkshire etc. If she portrays herself as a tough plain-speaking women (actually similar to Thatcher now I think about it) then she has a chance. Although she is not without flaws, she can portray the 'everyman' character better than Burnham who is pandering so hard it's ridiculous. Corbyn would face the same problems as Miliband - seen as an out-of-touch North London intellectual. Which in many respects he is.

b) Social Media is also not representative of young people either! Although most young people generally lean left, there's a fair amount of young Tories! But you wouldn't hear about it because they don't make much noise. The young people on twitter raving about Corbyn are already very dedicated to politics, which makes them unrepresentative. Even those young people who vote once ever five years, will likely still only have a casual interest in politics. Thus the highly-political noisy young folk on twitter are not representative. I'd liken them to the student politics scene, which is radically to the left of both the general population and also other students. But turnout in student elections is abysmal, with mostly only hard leftists voting, giving the impression that all students are very left-wing, which they aren't 

Side note, a different  demographics the Tories were *way* ahead with was  the over 65s, which are by far the most likely to vote. With an aging population the so-called 'grey vote' will only become more important, and if Miliband couldn't win them, I fail to see how Corbyn will. 

c) By losing a nation I assume you are talking about Scotland? Scotland doesn't really fit into the standard UK political trends, but I'll try to summarize why I felt Labour lost so badly. Basically Scottish Labour is monumentally shit. I cannot express how low of an opinion I have of them. They were lazy, incompetent, and basically did nothing for 30 years but wait for the votes to roll in. The SNP then got a tidal wave of support from the referendum, and won Scottish seats based on 'standing up for Scotland' and essentially nationalism. Contrary to popular belief, the SNP aren't actually to the left of Labour. If you look at what they are doing in Holyrood, it almost seems like they inherited the soul of New Labour. And British social attitude surveys show that the Scottish aren't really any more left-wing than the English or Welsh.

Onto the main point - Labour did try to win on mostly core support, and actually in Labour safe seats their majorities soared. This was mostly due to the collapse of the Lib Dems, and voters who left due to Iraq coming back. However, the core voters who did leave largely went to UKIP, about which I've talked about so much. FPTP requires winning swing voters. It's the essential point of the system. Some core voters may leave, but it's more of a risk IMO to be stagnant, with a shrinking but loyal base of support, than to reach out to other voters. Actually a core vote strategy is a bit similar to what the Tories do in Scotland, where a sizable minority of increasingly elderly voters, quietly vote Tory at elections. But it's not sustainable. This has been Labour's problem for decades- it's traditional supporters are just not numerous enough to win elections with.

I abhor the argument that people with vote for the 'real thing' if you offer so-called Tory-lite. Left wing voters who thought that Labour weren't left-wing enough didn't vote for the Tories. The entire argument makes no sense. If you are talking about centrist swing voters going Tory, then the alternative is to not even try to get them. If they didn't trust Labour on the economy, the solution is not to alienate them further by moving further from the mainstream. 

d) When the time is right, aye, but it does also involve hard work to align the party with the times. Labour may well win again, but it doesn't have an inherent right to government or to exist. But we are not living in times aligned with Corbyn's vision. The UK is more individualistic, more self-employed and more hostile to welfare and immigration than ever before. One measure of this is the fact that Union membership is shrinking, and is far lower than in say the 80s . What Blair did brilliantly was to see right-wing issues, and repackage them into a progressive way. Hence pushing economic credibility and Bank of England independence at the same time as tax credits, minimum wage, Sure start centres etc. 

The central issue I have with your next point is that although political pluralism is a good thing, I fundamentally believe that Corbyn would *harm* Labour and the left-wing. I am of the belief that Thatcher was able to get away with so much in the 80s because she didn't have a credible opposition. Some of her reforms, for example to the NHS and education, weren't that popular. But she could do it because people would not vote for an unelectable Labour party. If the Tories become the 'natural party of government' again and Labour become the permanent opposition, it doesn't matter how principled Mr Corbyn is. The Bedroom tax is an example of something that exist because Labour did not convince enough people of its responsibility - Prime Minister Miliband would have abolished it. 

In terms of Corbyn's policies being popular, eh I'm not so sure people would vote for it. Rail nationalisation has always been popular, but so has cutting immigration and welfare. A bundle of populist policies does not win elections if people don't trust you. Miliband shows this perfectly -- the mansion tax and energy price cap were very popular for example. But people didn't vote for it.

And he absolutely would push away centrists and swing voters. I am sure of it, for reasons I've already said

e) lol, Burnham

f) Like I said earlier, yes Labour faces a monumental task. I believe Cooper would be best out of the four to tackle it. But I think that saying  'they'll all lose so let's pick Corbyn' is flawed for one very simple reason

**things can still get worse for Labour**

There's an assumption by some people, that this is a nadir that Labour is bound to bounce back from. It's not inevitable - Labour lost in 79 and lost even worse in 83. Labour still has marginal seats that it could lose. Good Labour MPs who could not be able to represent or help their constituents, because Corbyn drags Labour further away from public sensibilities. Boundary reforms will entrench the Tory majority, making a hung parliament less likely, and anyway I don't think the potency of the Tory scaremongering over a Labour-SNP government will be any less effective in 2020.  Scotland is going to be a problem for Labour for years and there is no quick left-wing fix. 

Even if Cooper doesn't win, she wouldn't be as harmful or divisive as Corbyn. Lots of comparisons have been made with the Tories in opposition from 97-2010. Under IDS they appealed to the base and floundered and made no progress. However, under Howard they were still unsucessful, but began to rebuild and reform - losing 2005 but winning 2010. Kinnock did the same in the 80s. Corbyn would leave Labour floundering in opposition and not making a progress to being in government.

And fundamentally that's the point - to be in government. To make policies. To push Labour values. New Labour made many mistakes, but did much more for the poor, vulnerable, working class and its tradtional supporters in government, than traditional Labour was in opposition

We didn't sign any notable players that have a chance of starting because for once in a long while we have such a strong starting team, I can't think of any that we want to have even, barring Messi.

Is not a bad thing.  It's a good thing.  We have such a complete team because of our strong transfers in recent years that we didn't need to go out to buy.

Mourinho always say he prefers about 22 players in his team.  We have it but is just that some of them are on the younger side.  We have had a really good academy and from what I have read there is a change in club policy to try to get one young player to break out a season.  People always moan about that we don't give youth a chance and now we gave Zouma, RLC, Traore  et al a place, it is now oh we have such a weak bench.  You can't have it both ways.  During the pre season, Zouma was played DL and he did ok there.  If we can't get Babba, more game time for Zouma.

Who gives a shit about Liverpool bench when their first team is vastly inferior to ours?  They have Lovern in their first team who is worse than Zouma.  Their have a million strikers who all can't score goals whilst we have two that can bang them in.  Serious go take your Prozac.

We are favourites to win the Premiership by most people and for good reason.  Whoever has been responsible for our recent transfers have been spot on so I wouldn't worry about it.  Our squad is still strong or we won't be rated by everyone to win the Prem again.

null,null,nicolasbrody,null,null,null,"Jesus man, proper long response again - I'm kind of flattered!

A) I think Cooper's role in New Labour, the expenses scandal would hurt her. Corbyn is partly getting so much negative attention so far as he is winning (with other reasons that we can discuss if you like) if Cooper won this would all come out. Another big issue speaking in terms of winning back UKIP voters is that Cooper and the other three candidates are pro-eu, a big issue for UKIP voters. Corbyn is at least Eurosceptic (actually sceptical as opposed to anti-EU) and that's something which may appeal to some UKIP voters as lets face it - the Tories running things are all pro EU and have no intention of losing next years referendum. 

B) Not completely representative now, but relatively so due to how active young people are on social media. I don't think anything gives you a complete picture of a demographic's voting intentions but social media can give you a good idea about young people. I have no idea what Labour can do to win over many old people, Corbyn may win over disaffected old Labour voters but I don't think they are that numerous. 

C) Oh yeah the Labour party in Scotland are an embarrassment, and I agree the SNP aren't that left wing - but people think they are. Part of what won people over to the SNP in such great numbers isn't just the nationalism but their policies. If people start to find out the SNP aren't as left wing as they though they might be attracted back to a Labour party saying things that attracted them to the SNP in the first place.
I wasn't talking about left wing voters. To put it simply - people wrongly think the Tories are better then Labour with the economy and that Labour caused the crash of 2008. They then have two parties to choose from, both say austerity is neccessary. One is better at it and will do it properly, the other caused this mess in the first place and agrees it needs to be done. Who will people vote for? As long as Labour endorses austerity and the idea that they caused the crash then they are doomed. 2010 and 2015 is evidence of this. Labour increased their majority in some seats but it was reduced in many seats, especially ones where the Greens and UKIP did well (York where I just left saw 8000 votes go to the Greens and UKIP) 

D) I 100% agree that the Labour party doesn't have an inherent right to be in government or exist - it's something which I feel they need to remember. That is true, this is where we will differ. I don't want to accept a society that is anti-immigration and welfare, that is more selfish. If you win on a ticket that accepts all those ideas then what was the point? This is a purely personal opinion and it might not be that pragmatic but we can't be pragmatic and watch political parties be lead by media shaped opinion forever, we need people like Corbyn to shake things up, I firmly believe this. Like I believe America needs Bernie Sanders at the moment. The Blair method won't work again he is clearly a toxic brand now and anyone would have won leading Labour at that time, John Smith was doing very well before he died regretfully. I don't think Corbyn will harm Labour (not sure what you mean by that anyway, they are harming themselves at the moment) and I think Natalie Bennett did the left harm in 2015 (I voted Green too), Corbyn is putting left wing views into the mainstream and like we have seen with Burnham, politicians are and will respond to this. 

E) I actually think Burnham seems like a nice guy, he just needs to like and believe in himself more.

F) Things can get worse. I think the 1980's Foot example is used far too much. A Labour split is very unlikely to happen again because of what it did to them in the 80's and I don't see another Falklands war coming. What do you mean by public sensibilities? I think she might be less divisive but I don't think she'll win anybody over. Corbyn should not be doing this well - everything is stacked against him and everything has been thrown at him and he's still winning. If Cooper or any of the other three were going to be able to win over a significant amount of people, surely they'd be winning? Or maybe Corbyn is saying the right things at the right time? This trend seems to be replicating across the atlantic, in Canada and in Spain. I don't think IDS is comparable to Corbyn, as a person he is much more disliked and I think Corbyn has a wider appeal then him and strikes people as a more decent person. Let's be humble though, neither of us have any idea what will happen, we all through we'd get a minority government and the Tories won so, we'll have to see. I'm supporting Corbyn because he's putting forward policies and a vision that I personally like and that I think we need. Especially in terms of the environment and how we treat each other, it's weird seeing someone be so civil in his situation and it really shouldn't be. Whatever happens we're still dealing with a terrible government and I wish I could understand the mindset of a Tory voter, but I have tried and failed so far.

If you want a rough guide to writing one, then it usually goes like this:



1. Have an idea. You aren't going any further without that. 


2. Chose and define your characters. Make sure you really nail the mannerism and idiosyncrasies of the Doctor and his companions to make them feel 'real'.


3. Have a rough draft to lay out your idea. A intro to the situation for the characters, the situation, the climax, and the resolution. That's a *very* rough and basic outline. 


4. Write the damn thing. 


5. Read the damn thing. 


6. Redraft the damn thing.


7. Have some else read the damn thing. 


8. Repeat 5-7 until everyone is satisfied.


9. Post it somewhere. FanFiction.net, Archive of Our Own, GallifreyBase's Land of Fiction, and many others are good places to post it.

The UK is heavily city-centric, with basically only places like London, Manchester and Brizzle having much to offer on a regular basis. For people who don't live near those places, the best option is hanging out with your chums and getting wallpapered. Alcohol, weed, whatever your poison may be.

The issue is money. I moved to just outside LA. There's shitloads to do here, but only if you can afford it. On the rare occasion we're lucky enough to be able to drive a bajillion miles (since everything is spread out super far and there's shit all public transportation) to something, it costs almost much as someone in Devon getting the train to London to see some live music or stand-up or something.

Alcohol is the payday loans of entertainment. You get your payday, you don't think of spunking 30 notes on a friday with your mates making your own fun, even if you end up paying for it a thousandfold in the long run in terms of your health. But the economy is such that drinking is pretty much the most cost-effective and most widely appealing form of entertainment available to us, currently.

-backline had a few issues, but as the game went on looked very composed. I think with time they will be extremely solid, Richards was immense and looks a great leader at the back. 
-most of the new signings were excellent. Gueye (or is it Gana?) was fantastic, really busy, real steel in the midfield. Veretout flashed moments of class when he was on. Amavi was excellent, a couple of nervous moments when he gambled at the back, but he is just so good on the ball, and has a beautiful cross.
-biggest issue was that going forward there was a lack of direction when we were playing with the Sinclair-Gabby-Ayew frontline. none of them played badly, but I felt we lacked a real center forward to play through. definite improvement overall when Rudy came on. I'd like to see him or Kozak starting up front... not sure what the deal is with Kozak, not even being on the bench. Also interested to see what Gil could do to help direct our attack, assuming he can get fit and get selected.

City have Aguero and Bony, Sterling offers them that pace they lacked and also is an incredible player - probably the best that has been transferred. Don't forget they were pretty close last season and had a lot of injuries.

Wenger is not a specialist in failure as much as it pains me to admit it, and last season was the first season he's had a top class squad in years, he even showed progress by playing more compact in big games which is worrying. This is the first season he has had a squad capable of challenging and if they sign Benzema it could spell real trouble.

We played good going forward, but Gomis had Matic on toast and likewise with Montero on Ivanovic. Not trying to be a downer but we do need to improve, our bench was beyond uninspiring with our options in midfield/attack being mikel, ramires, moses, cuadrado, remy and falcao. Some more quality is needed in the fullback, central midfield and attacking midfield areas imo to not only improve depth and improve our starting XI, but give the players some competition to push their ability.

I still think we'll win the league, but with this small squad I can't see us being able to go far in all comps.

The job of the Labour party has never been to establish a socialist society via parliament, but the socialists who work in the Labour party should see their day to day work as part of a much broader anti-capitalist project. 

I see no contradiction at all between using the Labour party to win short-term gains for the working-class, to defend the class from Tory onslaughts, to defend the welfare state, and the long-term project of bringing about a socialist society. The accumulation of small victories, the weakening of the enemy class, all these things can be aided by pragmatic social democracy if it's backed up by proper working-class based socialist militancy outside the party (especially in the trade union movement)

The second thing however requires far more than simply voting Labour and expecting capitalism to be legislated away.

Hopefully now we can stop pretending we are going to win the league at a canter again and start playing like we desperately need 3 points from every game.

A few nitpicks
1). Please stop drifting out wide Costa. Not only are you not a great crosser but we basically have a midfield of hobbits, they aren't going to win an aerial duel. Get in the box and have faith one of our magical midgets can get you the ball.

2). Brana you need to track back like you thought you left the stove on. None of this lingering around because you are upset that a shot/pass missed. Also never let wingers turn inside on you. If they want to run to the corner and cross let them, we have a lot of big fuckers to handle those.

3). Cahill you got beat by Gomis too many times. Those over the top balls were coming all game, but you still acted surprised each time they came at you. 

4). Willian you can either run down the line and quickly cross or slow down, beat your man, and cut in. You can't do both simultaneously, it slows down the run of play too much.

These people are careerist hacks, the years of Mandleson and Blair made sure that most of the MP's in the Labour party are careerist robots with no shred of principle or human decency, who do as their told for the sake of their careers, so making them toe the line won't be hard I don't think. Just wait and see how many of these Blairites spivs become die-hard socialists if he gets elected. 

The process will have to involve de-selections on a gradual basis, and for Labour candidates with proper Labour values, people from working-class backgrounds, not just a conveyor belt of spads and Oxbridge educated careerist robots, to take their place. 

The Labour party is not just a vehicle to allow the likes of Cooper, Burnham and Kendall to fulfill their political ambitions and get their feet under the cabinet table. It exists to represent the working class, not to provide jobs to the well-connected political elite.

Last night a little dancer, came dancin' through my door
Last night a little angel, came pumping on my floor

And if it expires, pray help from above, because

In the midnight hour, he cried more, more, more

In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell he cried more, more, more
More, more, more!

He don't like slavery, he won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely he gives me head
I said, what sets you free and brought you to me, babe
What sets you free, I need you here by me, because

In the midnight hour, he cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell he cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell he cried more, more, more

They're what's called a ""mid table"" team. They are competitive enough to get as high as 5th place and will likely not get relegated. 

**Reputation**

Swansea are regarded as one of the few premiership clubs who can spend their money wisely and to the advantage of their football. Their owner is a millionaire in a league of billionaires yet manages to stay ahead of the competition by being efficient and organized. Like Hooli and Piedpiper. 

The supporters are the proud, local Welshmen and hipsters from America who don't wish to fund the oppressive regime of ""Man U, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpoo etc."" (I kid, i kid. Don't know much about the supporters. )

**Squad** 

Swansea play with striker Gomis. He has height, strength, pace, technique but inconsistent with the finish. He had an excellent run of form at the end of last season but a rough adjusting period before that. I would say he's a good player but the performance of previous Swansea strikers have set the bar high. The back up is new signing Eder. Sentimental fans might pray for the return of Michu's form who's been struggling with injury. To my knowledge, he's Swansea's highest, single season goal scorer in the Premiership. Their wingers are Monerno and Ayew with Dyer and Routledge competing for spots. They're all very quick with varying levels of trickery and strength. 

The crown jewel of Swansea is the midfield of Gylfi Sigi... Jonjo Shelvey and Ki Seung Yong. I'd have to say they're the best outside of the ""elite"". Gylfi plays like a classic no.10. Not mobile but finds passes and places shots. Unfortunately he's been lacking form as of late. Jonjo is the wild card. Either the best or worst player depending on the day. If the lord exists he works through Jonjo. Ki is the steadiest performer. Very tall, very composed, rarely gives away possession and deadly when inside the box. He's the least exciting but the most effective. In more cautious line ups, Jack Cork will make his way in. Not as graceful but keeps the balance and stops opposition attacks. Good player in his own right.  

The full backs are the duo of Kyle Naughton and Neil Taylor. I would say this is the weakest area of the Swansea squad unless the new signing, Tabanou, can step up. Ashley Williams is the leader of the team and is paired with Frederico Fernandez, Jordi Amat, or Kyle Bartley.

I absolutely loved it. Loved the way that we played. Came out strong for the first half. I felt like that game could've easily been 7-2 with the chances we had.

&gt;Man of the match?

I'm a toss up between Mahrez and Albrighton. Mahrez was dangerous everytime he touched it. Scored twice. One off the post. And a few other good looks as well. Albrighton was throing crosses in all day and notched a goal of his own. I'd say Mahrez was the biggest threat all day though so I'll give him the nod.

&gt;Performance out of 5?

I'd say about a 4.5. I don't know how much better we could've played than that. We had a few bad defensive plays in there where we seemed to get lazy but I think that was just due to being up 3 goals both times and people being on their heels. Hopefully Claudio lets them know that won't be tolerated.

&gt;What to see next game?

I want us to tighten it up defensively while still bringing the pressure that we had up top. Mahrez and Vardy were hounding guys up front and I'd love for that to be a common thread this season.

&gt;Other thoughts of my own.

I started following this team last year with 10 weeks left. I'm an American who didn't have an EPL team. I watched the Premiere all season long and never even really hear of Leicester. I wanted to find a favorite team and said ""what the hell, this team has 4 wins through 28 games and they're dead last. I'm gonna root for them to turn it around and avoid relegation. If they do, they're my team going forward."" Wouldn't you know they won 7 of their last 9 and won my heart. Looking forward to this season. It's nice to have a rooting interest!

Too many times he creates no space for himself to deliver a cross and he just hammers it off of the defender.  A lot of times he is seemingly running around aimlessly just to be active.  I see him honestly as a slightly better version of Ramires.  A lot of running, but seemingly not much else.  So no, you are not the only one, I am right there with you.

Pulling Fabregas off would have left us with a 4-1-3-1, we would have been absolutely decimated with all that space in between our front four and our back four, especially when Ivanovic pushed up the pitch.

That second deep midfield position was crucial to staying defensively sound, and we have no evidence to suggest that Oscar can play that deeper role.

Despite having a bad game, Fabregas is a solid formation is a lot better than Oscar in an unstable formation. The number 10 role is a luxury that is almost always sacrificed when a team goes down to 10 men and isn't already behind, because you can still have a solid attack and defense without it.

That all being said, the best move of the day was subbing Fabregas for Zouma. Our defense just became so much more solid after that swap. Once we controlled the midfield, we controlled the game.

null,null,DamienHanrahan,,Belfast,null,"&gt; The point is Frankie Boyle seems to project an image of himself as an ""edgy"" and ""fearless"" comedian, unafraid to break the scary codes of political correctness

Frankie Boyle does nothing of the sort, Frankie Boyle tries to be funny and isn't scared of venturing into all territories believing in comedy nothing is off-limits, despite the outraged gasps of people like you. That doesn't mean his comedy is designed to specifically target people, and telling jokes about the IRA he doesn't even intend on telling *just for the sake of offending someone* isn't what he's about. If he thought of a funny joke about the IRA I'm sure he'd tell it, but demanding he make those jokes to appease someone's imaginary criteria og offensiveness is ludicrous. 


&gt; Making fun of disabled and/or disfigured people isn't really brave at all though. 


He's telling jokes. He's making people laugh. Instead of insisting everyone be offended as absolutely  possible over every off-piste joke, how about teaching the fact that jokes don't equal real life? That everyone just have a laugh, and jokes aren't fucking weapons? 


&gt; Going into West Belfast and mocking the phallically-challenged balaclava-wearing deluded and inadequate... that would be quite brave to be fair.


Yeah it would. The same way singing chucky tunes down Sandy Row would be brave, but there's no point. As I said before, Frankie didn't tell the jokes because of some personal agenda against people with Downs syndrome, he made a joke he thought was funny. Insisting on telling jokes to insult the audience purely to be *fair* turns the comedy away from humour and into some politically unnecessary stand off which isn't what comedy was about.


&gt; Because just look at the personalised dogs abuse Maria Cahill takes here on reddit and twitter when she points out the IRA's shit doesn't smell of perfume.


Can you give me some examples?  


&gt; As Maria Cahill does.


Yeah definitely, I believe in total freedom of speech. But part of my freedom of speech is the right of criticising asinine opinions, of which this article definitely qualifies.

null,null,JuanPedia,null,null,null,"Have you finished the season yet?  It's gradually explained over the course of Series 8.

If you have finished Series 8 and still don't get it, here's the explanation:

It's all set up in ""Deep Breath"": we find out the Twelfth Doctor is having an identity crisis because he's questioning if he's still the same man he once was, having gone through so many regenerations.  The Half-Face Man says suicide is against his ""basic programming,"" the Doctor says murder is against his, but one of them is lying.  The Twelfth Doctor is faced with this possibility: that he's lying when he calls himself a doctor and that, at his core, he's truly a war general that will kill to accomplish his missions.

In ""Into the Dalek,"" we learn that the Doctor is in fact ""terrified"" at the possibility of not being a good man, and he turns to Clara because he trusts her completely and values her opinion above all (she tells him trying to be a good man is what truly counts).

In ""The Caretaker,"" the Doctor is happy when he thinks Clara's boyfriend is Adrian in the bow tie, thinking Adrian reminds Clara of him.  The Doctor's on the verge of tears when Clara tells him she loves the soldier and that the man in the bow tie is not her type.  If Clara prefers the soldier over the bow-tie man, what if she travels with the Doctor because he's less like the bow tie man and more like a soldier?  The Doctor is furious when Danny tells Clara the Doctor is really a war general.

In ""Death in Heaven,"" Missy offers the Doctor an army, claiming that's what he really wants to carry out his missions.  The Doctor turns down the army and realizes who he is: just a man trying to what's right with his friends, just as Clara told him in ""Into the Dalek.""  And it's made clear that Clara likes Danny for the same reason, because he, too, is a man just trying to do the right thing.",null,0,null,1439093282,null,null,false,0,ctwkj6f,null,t3_3gb5xq,null,null,null,t3_3gb5xq,null,null,null,1440368871,null,11,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11,null

If you pack the middle and try to force everything through there, Ross isn't going to be able to make progress going forward nor is he going to find a pass beacause he only has Rom to look for and he's being marked by 3 defenders while Ross has 3 of his own.

Now when Kone came on, the whole game changed, suddenly there were holes and space to run into and Watford couldn't tripe/double team Ross and Rom because they had to watch Kone too.

Look at our first goal, the defense goes with Rom, the ball comes to Kone and Ross is open. WHAM 1-1

Now let's rewind and see how this plays out if Kone hadn't come on.

The ball comes in towards Rom, but because he's the only target the ball is intercepted by a Watford defender who clears it and Watford are on the counter attack.

I'm not saying Kone is the answer but we all saw clearly the impact a second striker up front had against teams who are sitting back.

Most likely yes. But when you ask the mods to post something and they don't respond but ones from individual subs do its an interesting decision. 

If anything we'd love to be able to post just once in soccer vs in 10 teams sub reddits. Less work for us.

I just don't get how the post being in other premier League team sub reddits with mod  approval affects you. 

Are you visiting every one of these team sub reddits and getting annoyed by seeing it ? Whether we post it on soccer or in individual team sub reddits you're still most likely to only see it once I bet. 

Again, my apologies, but also think it's unfair to call it spam when we ask and get it approved to post too. 

If there's anything you think we can do to improve our process I'm all ears.

&gt; what was sitting on Rupert's bed? 

This is addressed in the immediate scene afterward where Clara asks if it could have been another one of the orphans and the Doctor says that its possible.  

The whole point of the episode is that it is ambigious.  There could have been a monster, but at the same time, there are also other explanations for the things that happened.

As presumably the only person on this board who has *actually* worked both in the Scottish Government and with environmental impact assessment teams, I just love the armchair opinions going round here. These kind of decisions are not just made up by ministers. They are the culmination of months and months of work by consultants and external organisations like SEPA. Scottish environmental bodies are far more concerned about our fragile biodiversity than our limited crop output. It isnour competitive advantage and it's a simple macro-scale decision. If England did this, sure it would have major impacts, but this isn't England. Scotland doesn't have the same intensive agricultural systems and doesn't need them. You don't need GMOs when most of your producers don't even have 50 hectares and they farm sheep anyway.

And despite the fact that all other major parties have 'anti-science' policies in regards to energy, biodiversity and the environment, this board can't wait to leap onto the anti-SNP bandwagon as always. Whatever in vogue trend makes you feel good. Typical. UpCorbyns all round, lads!

In real life, it's a dream people sometimes have.  I had it when I was about 8 or 9.  The writer of the episode, Steven Moffat, said he had the dream when he was a kid, and it inspired him to write an episode about it.

&gt;What wrote ""Listen"" on the chalkboard? The Doctor didnt remember writing it and he didn't seem to have a case of amnesia.

Clara said it looked like the Doctor's handwriting, the Doctor said he wouldn't have forgotten writing it, but Clara suggested it was likely he something he just forgot writing.  The Doctor instead proposed a theory that it wasn't something he forgot writing, but the work of an unknown creature.  It's up to the viewer to decide who was right.

Monsanto have been one of the most progressive companies to work for. They have extremely dedicated drives for green initiatives, massive drives for equality in science and are promoting something very bio-sustainable. 

The problem is anti-GMO people are not that well educated. 

Let's look at a simple problem. Golden Rice. Golden rice cost a lot of money according to anti-GMO that could have been used to fight Vit A related disease. Sure. 

HOWEVER, I am aware that the cost of development for golden rice is that same as what India alone spends per year and that the adoption of Golden Rice would have saved not just thousands if not millions of eyes and lives but also reduced expenditure on Vit A supplementation and the ecological damage of fish oil harvesting SOLELY for Vit A prophylaxis. 

The reason? Oh the carrot genes in rice could escape an contaminate organic rice. So people have to go blind so rich white people can eat organic rice? Okay. So Monsanto stepped in. Free Terminator sequences for Golden Rice. Nope. Now farmers cannot cross breed golden rice with local varieties which was the damn point. The template GMO would have been cross bred with local strain by the farmers themselves. 

So anti-GMO wanted to have a GMO that couldn't be crossbred but also could be crossbred. Which is only the demand of idiots. 

Now we must talk about ""Evil"". A huge chunk of the fertilisers and pesticides made for organic farming come from the Chemical Industry. Your pyethrin has to come from somewhere. A good chunk of it is made by a company called DOW Chemical. You may know them from DOW - Jones. Yep. That DOW. They hold the market share JUST like Monsanto. Like 20% of all Organic Lettuce in the USA uses just ONE of their pesticides. Oh something they don't tell you. Organic crops use pesticides. Just not very new ones. 

They are holders of a company called Union Carbide. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster

I missed the point where Monsanto has killed 3,700 people and wounded half a million in just ONE town. 

Now here is the thing? No one's fucking demanding in the West that Organic Farming's biggest supplier of farming chemicals answer for what amounts to mass murder. A crime that occurred because Union Carbide could get away with lax safety standards. Why? 

Because rich white people want their organic kale. It's easier to fearmonger over GMOs because most people are ignorant and have no idea how they work and it is easy to lie about them as somehow being less healthy. 

But as I said. It's not them that's the problem. It's the people making your conventional crops and the pesticides that are. But as people pointed out. 

It's only Indians, it's not like they killed Americans! 

Monsanto's bad rep is because people didn't understand how GMOs work. And because of modern patent law because no one's come up with a GMO law with regards to IP.

None of these define what is a safe country or make any mention of 'first' country. Doing so would be impractical from a number of perspectives.

Within the EU the Schengen Agreement ensures there is no right to keep applying in different EU countries if an application is rejected (which is one of the many reasons we shouldn't have opted out), and the main rules on who handles applications are laid down in [Dublin Convention](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:41997A0819(01)) which, again, doesn't specify anything regarding first countries or safe countries - so I suspect the Beeb are wide of the mark on this one.

&gt;There are perfectly good reasons why people from certain religious or ethnic backgrounds may not be ideally suited to France or Italy for example.

If you're Gay, North African or Muslim France isn't a place where you're going to be welcomed with open arms and if you're North African finding decent work is very hard. It has a poor reputation for religious freedom (somewhat unfairly) but the day to day experience on a social level isn't that great. So I can fully understand why some people operating on limited information would choose to avoid it. Same goes for Italy.

If GMO's are Evil due to Monsanto being nebulously evil for reasons of ""big corporations"". Then surely Organic is just as evil for reasons of ""Big corporations that have a history of mass killings due to shoddy safety procedures in developing nations while not paying out any real money to treat the problem they caused"". 

I repeat. Organic Farming uses Chemicals MADE by DOW. If we are talking about the evil committed in the name of profit DOW would be far far higher than Monsanto since most of what I know about Monsanto's ""evil"" seems to be ""hey you cannot splice our genes, we worked hard on that"" rather than ""Who cares if an accident happens, profit is more important than people"". 

Here's a TL;DR - We assume organic is some marvellous thing when it is wasteful, uses Chemicals (tm) and is interested in demonising GMOs when the majority of organic crops come from agribusinesses and chemical corporations some of whom have much more deadlier pasts than Monsanto which in fact has a very good reputation as a place to work and among farmers for the quality of products they make.

FFS? 

I am a doctor in rural India. You know all those farmer suicides? I see around 2 to 7 a week. Do you want to know the cause? 

Loan Sharks. 

Do you want to know what people in the UK and the USA think the cause is? 

Monsanto. 

Why? Cause the seeds that failed were from Monsanto. Not because these farmers were not given loans by banks whose agricultural managers told the farmers their plans sucked. Instead, no one was willing to tell them that you cannot run a subsistence or serf grade farm in the modern world. Rather than help promote alternative employment and the harsh truth we pushed the easy lie. These farmers go to model farms and see irrigation, mechanisation and the seeds. They understand water, they understand tractors but the seeds are magic. Agricultural bank loans aren't given for bad plans. 

Loan sharks however, do give out loans for bad plans. Farmer thinks seeds will turn life around, farmer buys them using bad loans, farmer crop fails. 

The alternative of this is the organic farmer who isn't told that the yield per acre of organic farming goes DOWN so they may actually make less money per acre particularly if they are hit with a pest problem. 

They then commit suicide because they took loans from the mob. 

The dialogue in the west? The seeds are the problem, Monsanto is the problem. Never mind the fact that Monsanto isn't even allowed to sell seeds directly in India without an Indian intermediary company. 

While I am sure that there are some daft Indians (In fact I know one) the majority of the people who oppose GMOs are people who have never been on a farm or who have no idea of the problems faced by poorer farmers who haven't had the benefit of the industrialisation of farming of the west.

Considering that at this period of time we were getting roughly 50k a year and unless they are all worth 10,000 British people I doubt it was immigration holding up the UK economy.

Immigration in the UK has pretty much always being negligible and we haven't required it for the economy to grow acting as if the only reason the economy hasn't imploded was because of immigration is pretty ridiculous considering the vast majority of the workforce is British.

b) I don't believe in corporate control of the food chain. Or, more precisely (because of course corporations do everything already), I don't believe that it should be lawful to prevent a farmer sowing seeds.

Furthermore:

c) I think animals should be treated well. The only system that enforces this as far as I know is the organic one. I can see labels like ""farm fresh"" and it essentially means nothing. Organic, however, [actually means something](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_certification). I know this is a tangential point, but GM food threatens the organic certification simply by being present in nearby fields. I want more organic food because it's better for animals. Organic farming also reduces antibiotic use in animals, which is a real issue because we're losing effective antibiotics fast. I want more organic food. Therefore I'm opposed to GM food.

d) After [what happened to Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland\)) (and some of my ancestors), I'm really really wary of monocultures. GM food promotes this to some extent, so I'm against it.

Artificial selection is a much slower form of ""genetic engineering"" than that practiced by Monsanto/etc but the result is exactly the same (at least in terms of the creation of new organisms that didn't exist before).

What's dubious about GMOs, IMO, is the extension of IP law into something as critical as the food supply.

Turning seeds into a licensable product like a Spotify subscription has far more potential to be abused than the current ""you pay us money, we give you seeds, and they're your seeds now"".

That said, I think most of the frothing at the mouth about this over on /r/unitedkingdom or /r/ukpolitics are missing the point.

[Here's what they said](http://news.scotland.gov.uk/News/GM-crop-ban-1bd2.aspx):

&gt;Mr Lochhead has confirmed that the Scottish Government intends to take advantage of new EU rules allowing countries to opt out of growing EU-authorised GM crops.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;The amendment to Directive 2001/18/EC came into force earlier this year and allows Member States and Devolved Administrations to restrict or ban the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) within their territory.

This is much more about the normalisation of the idea that Scotland can even *make* these kind of decisions than the merits or not of GMOs.

Directives like this normally only apply to member states; that this one also extends to devolved administrations gives the SNP an opportunity they wouldn't otherwise have had.

Having people think ""Scotland's making a bad choice, hurr durr SNP bad"" is not such a bad trade-off if it means another tiny step towards the idea that Scotland should be making these choices (and therefore when they can't, that they should).

30 years ago the idea that Scotland even *could* make that choice would have seemed as far-fetched as ""Yorkshire to ban GMP crop growing"".

++++++

As someone will no doubt read this and think ""SNP apologist tries to rationalise crazy anti-science platform"", I have no problem with either growing or eating GM food (if you've ever eaten food in the US the chances are very high you've eaten GM food) or indeed animals.

My objections are purely about the extension of IP law. Yes, large biochemical or pharmaceutical companies need to recoup their investment and they should 'own' (in some sense) the products of their labour. I can't offer a better solution, but that doesn't mean I have to give them my unwavering support - the commercial leverage it gives them over farmers is simply too much IMO.

Look back at the picture I linked of how we created the cauliflower out of the mustard plant. If Monsanto create a cauliflower 2.0, and you create a ""knock-off"" purely through natural selection, I think it would be a near certainty that you'd end up in court on the basis that you *must* have stolen something from Monsanto. That gives these companies far more power than simply reimbursement for their efforts - it allows them to affect people who created the same thing from their own efforts.

You already see this today with patents: company A creates a software product, company B creates something very similar, company A sues them and wins - regardless of company B being on the other side of the world and never having looked at company A's work.",null,0,null,1439114161,null,null,false,0,ctwr4tg,null,t3_3gbb70,null,null,null,t1_ctwphxr,null,null,null,1440372046,null,3,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

Monsanto was a chemical company

It bought an agriculture company and became a chemical/seed company

It merged and was renamed Pharmica

Pharmica was bought by Pfizer

Pfizer kept the chemical part but spun/sold off the seed business, using the old name 'Monsanto'

http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/pfizer_pharmacia


&gt;I just don't think that a merger and spin-off makes an entirely different company. That would just mean that the responsibility would disappear as long as you merge and spin-off.

Depends. Agent Orange for example happened long before they even got involved in agriculture. That business joined and left the company in the meantime. 

&gt;So what you're saying is that Pfizer is now responsible, is that right? And because they separated into two distinct categories, all the blame is off Monsanto and is now on Pfizer since Monsanto spun off into a different industry?

Well the 'blame' for something like agent orange should be with the organisation that invented it (the US Dept of Defence) but surely yes if the problem is a 'chemical' then a spun off company that does something else can't really be associated with it, except historically.

It's really just a co-incidence that they chose that name - they could have called the new agricultural company anything and the association wouldn't be there",null,0,null,1439115243,null,null,false,0,ctwrcza,null,t3_3gajev,null,null,null,t1_ctwpl5j,null,null,null,1440372153,null,5,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,null,Weedlefruit,null,null,null,"In my old town Polish people were largely hated. On one side it was seen they were stealing jobs due to local employment agencies only hiring them. The other side of it was due to gangs of large Polish men starting trouble.

On the first point of the jobs argument it was really a perception issue. I never had a problem getting work through an agency when I needed it but the kind of people using the ""stealing our jobs"" argument were the same that weren't applying and wouldn't get work if they did. They'd be in Wetherspoons at 10am on a saturday. I can see how they may feel they were cheated out of a job (because they're idiots) but it really is no different to losing out on a position to another english person who was better suited for it.

The second point was another perception issue and was perpetuated by hearing stories down the pub that helped paint a negative picture of them - yes, there was crime and trouble on the part of some Polish people, largely men but these were really just bad people that happened to be from somewhere else and were outnumbered by all of the amazing hard working Poles that got work because they asked for it and did a bloody good job when they go it. Every country has its cunts at the end of the day and some will get on a plane.

Essentially the town had a large influx of people looking for work from Poland, a better life and to capitalise on the availabity of agency positions that brits didn't want etc. This meant the useless morons of the town had an excuse for why they weren't in work and therefore a vested interest in painting a bad picture of those they feel took the jobs from them.

For mineral oil you can use Johnson's unfrequented baby oil (does not emulsify, but works and is cheap).

The one reason why houses cost so much is (as was stated at the start) demand is greater than supply. But it's nothing to do with ugliness. I've driven through modern housing estates and not thought, ""Wow, ugly! I must object to future house building."" I can imagine however that NIMBYism does play a part - if you've bought a house that overlooks rolling countryside, no matter how beautiful the architecture, you will not want to have a new estate replace that rolling countryside.

I generally quite like the look of modern estates (but do wonder about the size of rooms, garages etc). And I want people to build more houses to reduce the price of houses for our future generations.

Also, homeowners SHOULD care about the price of houses rocketing because:

(1) many of them will at some stage want to move to a bigger home and that price difference is getting bigger and bigger

(2) many of them will spawn and their children will not be able to afford to buy their own property before the age of 40 unless:

This would likely be a one-way only move.  

If you live in an expensive area and you want to up-size, say from a flat to a terraced house and stay in the same area, the move will be more expensive for you, because the terraced house will cost proportionally more, if you assume that all properties in an area increase in value by roughly the same amount.

The only people who really profit are the people who own a house apart from their home that they don't need to live in, or people who live in houses that are larger than they need, and are renting out rooms.

An old lady who is living alone in the family home she bought with her husband in the '60s for £1000, which is now worth over a million, is not rich because of the value of her property.

Could have just about lost when St Mirren came into it but if the team can settle a little more in front of goal we'll drop few points playing like that.

It's difficult to know what to make of it in terms of guessing how the season will go, if you're picking fault we were so open and the misplaced passes in our own half just caused chaos at times. There's certainly a sense that if you play like we did if a team can successfully sit in they can get a goal up or certainly feel like they're in it. I wouldn't say the defence looked dodgy though, I'd be happy with those 4 for the year if they stayed fit.

I'll be really interested to see how the Alloa and Ayr games go. Rangers have never looked imposing or convincing away from home in the lower leagues. There have been games they've struggled to get 2 or 3 shots on target in 45 minutes and there's certainly been no fear factor. 

I think it's arguably more important in terms of the league challenge than the Hibs game at Ibrox itself. If Rangers have enough of the game to put 20+ shots on these teams away from home we'll be difficult to top.

I dunno, my family are all in Sussex and there's no way I can afford to live there (especially as I'd probably have to work in London due to my somewhat specialist career in IT).

I just emigrated to Barcelona - the prices are much saner here, but euros aren't worth much back in England (salaries are lower here, but the cost of living cancels it out) so if I return then my savings won't be worth much and I doubt I'd be able to return and buy a house even at an older age.

So yeah, the shitty housebuilding policies have essentially condemned me to economic exile from my childhood home. Although I think Scotland has saner prices and is awesome so if I returned I'd probably return to Edinburgh (I did grad school there) or the South West if I could find a job there.

I have a single dual-x 270x. No warranty, no box and only the crossfire connector and molex to pcie power (2). I am not sure as to how much I could get for it shipped as after the 300 series where released all the 200 series cards went back up in price. Would £70 shipped sound fair?

1. Number of Defenders
2. Distance to the Goal
3. Distance to the Ball
4. Direction of Play

Now,

1. There was no more than 1 defender (including the goalkeeper) between the player being fouled and the goal (there was 1, namely Gary Cahill).
2. He was inside the penalty area, which is close enough to make it an obvious goalscoring opportunity.
3. The ball was at his feet, no more than a yard away, and firmly in his possession.
4. The BALL was moving to the left of the forward, but only slightly, and play was definitely moving goalwards very quickly.

All in all, definitely a red card for a Denial of an Obvious Goal-Scoring Opportunity, or a 'professional foul' as it may be known by some here. Sadly, the ref and Assistant Referee (linesman) made the right call here.

I have faith in Asmir for Man City!

Too be blunt that is stupid and just letting officers get hurt for no reason.

Perfect example going back 4-5 years when some guy was being questioned by the police ( on one of the cop shows in UK) and decided to run for it, one of the police officers got him down but then was sliced on the side of his face due to the guy having some sort of small knife on him.
Easily could of been avoided.

Another example is the recent viral video of two cops taking a guy out of a cafe to question him then he turns around to shoot them but they are too quick for him and gun him down, no one needed to be in danger there or killed, they had every chance they wanted to cuff him, but if they did then it would been cuffing some poor innocent guy-_-

Another example(because there is literally thousands of times when cuffing someone being questioned would of saved lives) is when that cop in America questioned some twat in a car who decided he will just pull a gun out and shoot the cop up (I can't think of many details in that story but it was on a cop dash cam)",null,0,null,1439118152,null,null,false,0,ctwrzd1,null,t3_3g8qcz,null,null,null,t1_ctwru53,null,null,null,1440372446,null,1,null,bristol,t5_2r52c,1,null

1: Commercial products represent a choice, if people do not wish to buy patented strains they do not have too. I think the proof in the pudding here is the current organics market which is huge despite a large body of evidence suggesting (excluding pesticide exposure reduction which I contend is not unique to organics) that they have no health benefits.

2: Companies like monsanto are currently spending large amounts of money sending scientists out to places like South America and Africa (ie the ancestral areas for many staple crops) and gathering as much genetic material as possible for storage in seed banks. There is widespread evidence that polyculture crops are more productive than monocultures so I do not believe diversity will be a problem going forward. indeed I believe it will be less of a problem than it is now (see the Cavendish banana). Its also worth noting that applying done research to new varieties of similar crops is often (not always) far easier than carrying out the research *de novo*.

3: Apart from pesticide resistance leakage I don't see this as a problem. I accept that these genes may spread but no more so than from domesticated varieties. Its also worth noting that it would be possible to produce 'terminator transbosase' varieties which will only grow in very specific conditions and therefore cannot spread in the environment. The great thing about terminator transbosases is they are **always** inherited so are not really subject to the randomness of normal reproductive spread.

Cops need to gain information before acting with force. There was a case in America where a cop saw someone running, assumed it was who they were after and rammed him against the wall, the guy wasn't the dude they were looking for but from the force of the ram he ended up being paralysed.

Most people don't pass through safe countries, the vast majority claim asylum well before they get to Britain. Those who do will have passed through up to 6 safe countries, and no more than 2 western European countries.

1: Plant varieties are currently patented and these are not GM varieties. This is a simple reality that stems from companies like Monsanto having to make a profit. We often see arguments like 'These companies force us to buy new seeds rather than store them ever year' and 'you have to sign a contract before buying seeds'. These are manipulations of the truth. Modern agricultural machinery requires seeds of a consistent size to function, only large companies with highly controlled conditions can produce these. Reports of people being sued for keeping seeds are invariably due to them trying to share these seeds or sell them themselves, this directly impacts the companies cash flow from their intellectual property and hence has to be stopped - its exactly the same as selling knock off apple products (or whatever).

2: As I said, varieties that are not genetically engineered are already patented. As explained in the last point companies like Monsanto do not stop farmers sowing seeds - they are welcome to store them for personal use but will choose not to. The risks of having a crop fail due to poor seed quality outweigh the benefits. Buying direct from the supplier totally eliminates that risk. The principles of free market of course apply here, people are always welcome to buy non gm seeds and assuming there is demand there will be supply. 

3: This isn't a GM problem. There is no reason standards cannot be enforced along similar lines. Indeed it already exists (though perhaps not to the same level) - see Red Tractor, RSPCA Freedom Food etc. 

4: Companies like monsanto are currently spending large amounts of money sending scientists out to places like South America and Africa (ie the ancestral areas for many staple crops) and gathering as much genetic material as possible for storage in seed banks. There is widespread evidence that polyculture crops are more productive than monocultures so I do not believe diversity will be a problem going forward given there is incentive to develop it. Indeed I believe it will be less of a problem than it is now (see the Cavendish banana). Its also worth noting that applying done research to new varieties of similar crops is often (not always) far easier than carrying out the research de novo.",null,0,null,1439118804,null,null,false,0,ctws4r3,null,t3_3gajev,null,null,null,t1_ctwqgc7,null,null,null,1440372516,null,10,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

null,null,SufferSome,null,null,null,"&gt;b) I don't believe in corporate control of the food chain. Or, more precisely (because of course corporations do everything already), I don't believe that it should be lawful to prevent a farmer sowing seeds.

Corporations already control this through traditional breeding and licensing of seeds. Farmers in this country almost never sow seeds that they have collected themselves, because these will lack hybrid vigor - they purchase it all each year from seed suppliers. These suppliers are big corporations.

&gt; c) I think animals should be treated well. The only system that enforces this as far as I know is the organic one. I can see labels like ""farm fresh"" and it essentially means nothing. Organic, however, actually means something. I know this is a tangential point, but GM food threatens the organic certification simply by being present in nearby fields. I want more organic food because it's better for animals. Organic farming also reduces antibiotic use in animals, which is a real issue because we're losing effective antibiotics fast. I want more organic food. Therefore I'm opposed to GM food.

I agree with organic for animal welfare, but it is a complete con for crops. 'organic' just means using techniques that existed 100 years ago, not necessarily using things that are natural or healthy (e.g copper sulphate is toxic to humans). Also, since pest control is limited, organic crops have increased levels of microbes that produce toxic compounds.

&gt; d) After what happened to Ireland[2] (and some of my ancestors), I'm really really wary of monocultures. GM food promotes this to some extent, so I'm against it.

Already a problem with traditional plant breeding, as Ireland discovered. GM tech actually provides tools for engineering solutions to this problem (e.g. by engineering diversity in plant immune systems).",null,0,null,1439119396,null,null,false,0,ctws9oy,null,t3_3gajev,null,null,null,t1_ctwqgc7,null,null,null,1440372581,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I do worry that the Cerave one will break me out as lots of people say it does them, but of course I cannot know if it will unless I try it.

You clearly have no grasp on reality.

You think everything is black and white, the police don't just go up to someone and go that guy is super dangerous! and the other guy is only a little.

Hence the examples I have just given where someone being stopped who showed no signs of being a twat ended up cutting a policeman's face up.

You seem the sort of person to shout ""AM I BEING DETAINED""

The police risk their lives with every interaction with people, when I was stopped by them to be questioned, I could of acted all nice and then just shot or stabbed them when they were off guard.

And yes I do like so many other adults have the attitude of I have nothing to hide, because I have never had an issue with the police like so many other adults have not had problems, yet when ever you see the morons who moan about the police or get stopped and end up saying they are part of Earth or some shit so they don't need to follow the law, they always end up being scummy looking, immature morons who typically end up having some sort of guilt.

null,null,wdtpw,null,null,null,"First, thank you for a long and considered answer. I'm afraid I do disagree with a large part of your answer. Here are the reasons.

&gt; This is a simple reality that stems from companies like Monsanto having to make a profit.

This is equivalent to an argument saying ""well that's just the way it is."" My whole point is that I think patenting of living organisms is wrong. Therefore we need a new way of doing business. The more GM becomes established, the more this will happen, not less.

&gt; Reports of people being sued for keeping seeds are invariably due to them trying to share these seeds or sell them themselves ... As explained in the last point companies like Monsanto do not stop farmers sowing seeds - they are welcome to store them for personal use but will choose not to.

I don't believe this is correct, so I went to the source:

&gt; http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/why-does-monsanto-sue-farmers-who-save-seeds.aspx

The key line for me is this one:

&gt; When farmers purchase a patented seed variety, they sign an agreement that they will not save and replant seeds produced from the seed they buy from us.

Note that this, and the surrounding text explicitly says that Monsanto has agreements to prevent a farmer replanting, and that they will move legally against them if they do so. It also says explicitly that the threat of legal action is often sufficient to get farmers to behave. Note what it doesn't say: that farmers are ok to replant for their own use. It doesn't say this because this is not Monsanto's position, and it is incorrect to suggest it is.

&gt; This isn't a GM problem.

Again, I don't believe this is correct, because I think here you misunderstand my point. Absolutely, other marks and standards could be propagated. My point is that currently the best and most trustworthy one is the organic one. GM is a direct threat to organic farming. For the reasons given above, I really like organic farming.

ALSO INCLUDED with purchase of main rig:

* Microphone for video calls etc.
* Logitech Z323 speakers (2.1 - surprisingly great sound)
* Sundry additional cables, original boxes, screws and spare parts that came with the initial components.
* Fully articulated desk-mounted VESA monitor stand for dual monitors (as pictured, was a bitch to find and put together as the QNIX is so damn big)
* Original freestanding monitor mounts
* Original heatsink/cooler for Intel CPU

Price for everything above together: £1250 plus postage. Collection would be fan-fuckin'-tastic as the monitors in particular are a bitch to ship. 

Q: Why the exorbitant, unreasonable, titanically huge price for a BRONZE certified PSU and a filthy casuel i5? 

A: These parts are cast-iron and I did my research before I bought them. The Seasonic PSU is bronze but it's a far better unit than a Corsair RM750, for example. Most parts in this build are at least a couple of notches above the basic grade. The RAM is colour co-ordinated with the mobo. This is a rig I built for fun and it's my baby. If I could, I'd ship it across the Atlantic, but I can't, so I'm selling it here.

Q: Has anything been overclocked?

A: Yes, but only for testing purposes. The GPU, CPU and 1440p monitor have all been successfully overclocked. The CPU overclocks to 4.2 with no trouble at all. The GPU overclocks decently, but honestly it could probably use some better thermal paste on the cooler if you want to push it heat-wise, so I've kept it at stock as I can't be arsed cracking open the casing. The monitor overclocks to 96Hz without complaining. They've all been kept at stock as I don't want to overstress the parts.

Q: Temps, bugbears? 

A: Temps are great. The Corsair cooler keeps everything chilly and there's tons of room for the mobo due to the case's design. No temperature-related issues at all. Sound from the integrated soundcard (thank you based ASUS) is fantastic, but takes a couple of seconds to 'wake up' if the rig has been sleeping. Storage is quiet and blazing fast - no complaints at all. The case collects a fair bit of dust (I've just cleaned it again) but it's roomy for an ITX so it's no problem to clean and maintain. The monitor stand takes a bit of getting used to (I've taken to angling the smaller second monitor to stream media while I work or game) but that's mostly an issue with the user rather than the hardware. The wireless receiver is an official one, but Windows occasionally has trouble recognising it, so you need to manually find the driver. This is a documented issue with the official Xbox receiver and Windows 8.1, and it's a 10-second fix. Otherwise the receiver works far better than I thought it would - great for having a friend game on the 2nd monitor in BL2.

Things I will do: sell the tower, keyboard and monitors separately, if needs be.

Things I will not do: pull parts out of the tower.

***OTHER THINGS FOR SAAAALE! IT'S A BONANZA!***

I've also got some additional odds and ends related to this rig that I'm happy to part with as well:

* ~~Intel i3-3250 processor - used once (perfect condition) and stock cooler: £55~~ ***SOLD!***
* ~~Sapphire R9 270x - used twice (near-perfect condition) and included power and graphics cables: £80~~ ***SOLD!***
* ~~Corsair H55 liquid CPU cooler and Kraken GPU bracket for mounting cooler to your graphics card (bought but never used): £40~~ ***SOLD!***
* PowerLine Ethernet-through-mains adapters - run high-speed internet through a power socket (yes, this is a real thing - it was my primary way of hooking up my machine to the internet, and it works extremely well): £20

A lot of people I know do back breaking work in warehouses all day for minimum wage there isnt a lack of work ethic that makes Brits not do the job. It is more likely due to the fact that harvesting strawberries is seasonal it has no job security and you cant really plan a life through it.

null,null,design-of-homes,null,null,null,"This only addresses one aspect of the housing crisis: namely the opposition to new developments. Even if opposition fades due to better housing design, it does not mean that house prices will fall. (The logic of course is that if housing supply rises to meet demand then house prices will stall because there is no longer a housing shortage).

But is it really opposition to new housing that's stopping homes from being built? Contrary to the common view that we need to concrete over the countryside, there is plenty of brownfield sites that can be developed for housing to meet demand. The Bank Of England produced an influential report on this topic a decade ago in 2004 called [Review of Housing Supply] (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3518866.stm). I doubt there is much opposition to new homes in these brownfield locations. It's the cost of developing these sites that make them unattractive to housebuilders (because of associated clean-up costs for example and the need to develop the surrounding area in some cases). 

Also, not all greenbelt land is of outstanding natural beauty. Plain-looking agricultural land could be an option for redevelopment.  

Other factors: Right-to-Buy has severely depleted the stock of social housing but local councils cannot use the money from the sale of those homes to build new housing. A report from Labour London Assembly member Tom Copley revealed that [at least 36% of homes (52,000 properties) sold through Right to Buy in London are now let by private landlords] (http://tomcopley.com/buy-homes-london-privately-rented/).

And don't forget too that the housing market in the South East is overun with buy-to-let investors who are often chasing the same properties as first-time buyers. The Evening Standard reported back in 2012 that at least [50% of new-build stock in London is sold to buy-to-let investors] (http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/rentals/buy-let-long-term-safe-haven-your-savings).

What's more, buy-to-let investors enjoy [better tax advantages than first time buyers] (http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/19/buy-to-let-tax-avoiders-shackle-first-time-buyers-578564/). The recent Budget announced a tax-relief cut for buy-to-let landlords that may (or may not) dampen demand from property investors.

We now seem to be in an impossible situation where homeowners who have purchased overpriced properties don't want to see the value of their homes drop. On the other hand, inflated house prices are stopping first-time buyers from getting on the property ladder. Meanwhile, more and more neighbourhoods in London are becoming buy-to-let ghettoes.

Suffice to say, housing policy and regulation in the UK is a complete and utter mess and no political party seems to have a clue what to do about it.

Not (at best) breeze blocks, or (at worst) plasterboard.

My Mum's house (didn't cost her the world - it's in the North) is 20 inches of solid stone exterior, and *all* interior brick. It's from about 1840.

We can't hear the neighbours pissing, and if you're on the first floor, you can't even hear the television downstairs.

All the original windows have survived with minor maintenance, the stonework hasn't budged, original roofing, original guttering. And it's a pleasure to walk around in. It's not high tech - it's the opposite. It's just solid, simple design. 

Even my own home, which isn't as grand, managed to make its mere 850 sq ft a pleasant environment. Large windows, an extra foot of ceiling space, and hand moulded characterful bricks. Plus, partition walls between the terraces are *also* brick. 

There's no reason this couldn't be achieved today, but with modern design. 

Brick, timber, stone, glass, with a few hand-finished extras.

Instead we get plastic and plasterboard boxes with as little imagination as possible, all to make a quick quid.

I'm not breaking new ground by saying building houses is expensive but i'd say the main focus of these redbrick houses is affordable housing,

Building as many houses as you can in the land without costing too much to try and keep the overall cost of each house down, 

If you build the same houses out of stone i expect people would consider them as beautiful but the cost would be ten times that of a brick house (i haven't checked the exact figures)

You do get some places that are rendered on the outside and painted a yellow creamy colour which is allot nicer than brick,

A possible solution could be to only do the front road facing side in stone and the rest rendered, 

I have worked on a couple sites where these type of houses are being built and when the subject comes up the other people working on site agree that they don't really look good but its whats on the plan,

I expect its either a lack of creativity by the architect (or trying to look modern (cause thats what they learn to design?)), the people proposing the new build worried that if the design changes they wont abide to all the strict planning regulations, or it could entirely be a government mandated 'a affordable house should consist of' type deal

Just as an after thought i saw some new builds recently that just had some really dumb design choices, the thing that jumped out a me was the upstairs windows had white edges on the bottom and sides but not the top,

This turned into a ramble

Research is damn expensive for example bringing a new drug to marker [costs $2.6B on average](http://www.scientificamerican.com/artice/cost-to-develop-new-pharmaceutical-drug-now-exceeds-2-5b/). Much harder to find figure for GM but [~$150m](https://gmoanswers.com/ask/how-much-time-does-it-take-and-how-much-does-it-cost-successfully-develop-hybrid-one-or-more) for a very simple modification seems a fair valuation - more complex traits may stretch to billions. The world will starve unless food production is increased and GMOs offer a clear solution to that, but one someone will have to pay for. They may not be a panacea but with 9.6 billion people predicted to be living on earth 2050 surely GMOs are a better alternative than starvation? I should point out here the best results can be achieved through the synthesis of techniques, by combining things like hydroponics, polycultures, indoor farming, GM organisms and reduced meat consumption we could potentially increase food output by several fold and reduce environmental damage hugely. 

As for the Monsanto thing. Apologies, I made a mistake from memory on seed saving, however I still believe it is a farmer's choice who they buy seeds from. Nobody forces them to buy from Syngenta/Monsanto etc - they do it by choice because it is the most profitable thing to do. I don't see why those companies should not be allowed to charge fairly. If they did not, nobody would buy their products. 

I agree with you in terms of animal welfare - that Organic certification probably does guarantee the best conditions but once again there is no reason at all you could not swap the organic animals for GM ones and achieve the same results. You can't think of GM animals as GM Pigs or GM cows or GM chickens, they are just cows, pigs and chickens with slightly different DNA. 

GM is not a threat to organic farming, that is an element of consumer choice. As I have stated previously - the only scientifically proven benefit of organic farming is reduced pesticide application and GM could potentially deliver that AND the productivity of conventional farming technique. That would be a win win for everyone.

It's the South of England...

I live just outside of Sheffield with my fiancée.

In her first year as a teacher aged 23 she bought a 3 bed late Victorian red-brick cottage. It's in an old minig area, but we have no houses at the back or the front, and our neighbours are lovely. About 850 sq ft plus a garden.

Fully done up, pleasant understated kitchen.

Ideal starter home. Was about £90,000, and mortgage repayments are about £350 a month. Cheaper than renting.

There are loads of houses like this stretching from Birmingham to the Scottish Highlands.

Problem? Few jobs in  Sheffield/Nottingham.

The problem isn't really homes - it's uneven job distribution throughout the UK.

But it's a vicious cycle. No jobs = no investment and money = no jobs.

I've done some part time work through university, but I'm really worried that I won't be able to find a job in the place I grew up...

[The next week they ran what I can only describe as a 'hit piece' on Maajid Nawaz](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/02/maajid-nawaz-how-a-former-islamist-became-david-camerons-anti-extremism-adviser) - who is known for campaigning against Islamism in the UK.

The question is - why is the Guardian giving softer interviews to Islamists than people who fight Islamism?

If we could sort out the issues of food patenting, corporate control, monocultures, side-contamination of those who want to do other types of farming, etc, I'd be fairly relaxed about GM food.

No-one has any idea what threats can emerge in the world, the idea of defence weapons is to combat any and all possible threats wherever they surface. We don't have eyes and ears in the Foreign officers of our potential enemies nor their intelligence services.

Non state enemies may be the current problem facing Britain but there are countries in the world which are not friendly to Britain.

There were also many ways they could have compromised and kept the same policy. They could have downplayed their commitment to it during the campaign, or said 'it's an aspiration, not a goal'. They didn't, they made it a key pledge.

Conservative voters are typically home owners (as are the middle class Labour voters). Many MPs (or their immediate family) are BTL landlords. Voters like to see house prices go up because they 'feel' richer. There is no political capital in solving this problem for either party. 

Many older people have few or no pension savings, instead using their house as a bank to extract money from. This makes up a fair percentage of consumer spending power too, which would have to be offset by the younger people being able to afford new property. Older people vote, young people don't, there is no political capital in solving this problem for any party.

Until people start quantifying the costs of excessive housing costs and overcrowding nothing will be done. Young people need to start voting.

No-one in the UK can buy guns.

Instead relying on the assumption that the PSNI/MI5 can do no wrong. That's a mistake they should be held accountable, if there is a case to answer they should answer it. If it is left unanswered it will only add fuel to the fire, with young disenfranchised people joining the ranks of dissidents.

&gt;The Guardian, it seems, was not happy. Rather than react by providing much beleaguered feminist, gay or ex-Muslims with a crucial platform—as one would expect from a progressive newspaper—they featured a [doting interview](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/24/david-cameron-extremism-struggle-generation-abdul-wahid) with the UK front-leader for the Islamist extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT) complaining about the Prime Minster’s speech. HT wishes to resurrect a theocratic caliphate, in which—according to its draft constitution available online—they would execute “apostates.” They also believe in ISIS-style medieval punishments, such as stoning, amputations, punishing homosexuals, and approving of slavery in principle. I should know, for 13 years I was on the leadership of this group, serving five of those years as a political prisoner on its behalf in Egypt.

null,null,Galerath,null,null,null,"I think this video moves from ""sensible"" to ""sounds plausible but is actually bollocks"" when he starts talking about ugliness. The reason nobody objected to the building of Venice was because *nobody had the power to object*. Italy was a collection of city states usually ruled either by a council of rich families or an absolute monarch, your local peasant might have not liked the new city being put up, but your local peasant could do fuck all about it. Similarly the residents of Bath in the 18th century didn't exactly have a local planning authority to go and complain to. Additionally there was a totally different culture towards building things - expansion was seen as glorious progress and man conquering the hostile wilderness, not destruction of our beautiful natural heritage etc. etc. 

I'm sure NIMBYism plays a part, but it's not ugliness that's the issue, it's going to mostly go back to the vested interests point - if I owned a 5 bed house on the edge of the greenbelt I'd be pretty pissed off if some developer came and built 1000 houses around about me as 1: it would personally inconvenience me with more traffic, more noise, all the building works etc. 2: it would likely lower the value of my house which no longer has sweeping views of the countryside. 

There is also the problem that the infrastructure in the UK is absolutely shit and local councils tend to have their heads firmly planted in their arses about it. They're presently building hundreds of houses near my parent's suburban home, but the school, doctor and dentists in the area are already massively over-subscribed. The roads are a total nightmare at rush hour already and there's really far too much traffic as it is for a residential area. What are the council doing about all this? Fuck all is the answer. They're just piling more houses onto an already over-stretched infrastructure and damn the consequences (I'm convinced they've been paid off by the local developers). In such cases, the NIMBYs actually have a good point.

Further he doesn't seem to address the point that demand is concentrated in certain areas (mostly London) and that's a symptom of our overly concentrated, lop sided economy.

Pre-drinking cheap from supermarkets before heading out is a huge problem.

It's not hard to get drunk and the average person can easily do it on bar prices.

Maybe this will be a step towards ending ridiculous drink prices (£1 bombs, vodkas, pints etc) by reducing pre-drinking at home before heading towards to the final destination and only spending £10 in businesses that have huge overheads.  Bars and clubs are not highly profitable businesses by a long, long shot.

Young people especially will arrive in town, go to an off-license and share a bottle of high strength alcohol before queuing for a venue.  This makes it hard for doormen to identify the effects, on top of it not always being obvious to door-staff anyway and the businesses themselves desperate to let people on to keep their business doors open

Obviously the use needs to be monitored, but it is certainly a step in the right direction to squash this binge drinking culture we have.

As a barman i once saw someone go up to the bar and order 5 jagerbombs for £5 for each of their friends.... Each person then then downed them at once.  Each bomb is as strong ABV as a jack Daniel's and coke.  Even worse when you think of what red bull does.  It's not healthy, its not needed to get drunk and it is not profitable for the business.

From a simple business point of view: 

&gt; Pubs and clubs operate on about 60-70% overall profit from drinks (brought down massively by the cheap drinks deals that venues have to do to compete with supermarkets and off-licences).  

&gt; Labour and wages costs, that cover security, management, promotions staff &amp; manager, bar/floor staff and DJs should run at about 30% of takings.

&gt; So for every £1000 a venue takes it makes, say, £650 on alcohol at 65% profit and spends £300 on wages. At this stage, that's £300 profit on every £1000.

&gt; Then work in rent, advertising, business rates, maintenance/repairs, other entertainment, licensing costs, sundries like glassware/cleaning products etc and a bulk load of other costs including any head office costs and staffing if it is a bigger brand and it doesn't make for an awesome business.

The rise of pre drinking has made it tougher for these businesses with most nights not getting busy until midnight, which means 3 hours of good trade at best.

It's early stages, but i am interested to see how this works.

Pre-drinking cheap from supermarkets before heading out is a huge problem.

It's not hard to get drunk and the average person can easily do it on bar prices.

Maybe this will be a step towards ending ridiculous drink prices (£1 bombs, vodkas, pints etc) by reducing pre-drinking at home before heading towards to the final destination and only spending £10 in businesses that have huge overheads.  Bars and clubs are not highly profitable businesses by a long, long shot.

I look at it like this: if we have nukes and say Israel launches theirs at us and we launch ours at them then we both get wiped out. If Israel launches there at us and we don't have any we get wiped out and there are lives saved on the Israel side because they weren't wiped out. Either way we lose and we are also down on cash then too. I don't believe either of the above situations would happen anyway because we are still in NATO, some of those countries have nukes.

Also, I think the historical point the video made about developments in the past being unopposed is very unconvincing. Venice did not always look like it did now, nor is it a housing development, it is a city, ditto for the development of Bath. These things are simply not comparable. Indeed, if the issue is that we aren't developing new towns and cities then that is a much more complex problem which has to do with the dominance of London and size of UK agriculture. Finally, I think it would be extremely interesting to look into why modern housing developments tend to be 'ugly'.

null,null,wherearemyfeet,null,null,null,"&gt; I don't think it's right to ""own"" genes. This is the current business model, so I'm opposed to it.

Business don't own ""genes"". They can patent (remember that patents are limited) their utilisation for a specific novel purpose. It's also worth remembering that pretty much every commercial seed today is patented, including organic. Being against GM for patents while supporting organic, with all due respect, shows a huge lack of understanding of how seed patenting works.

&gt;I don't believe in corporate control of the food chain. Or, more precisely (because of course corporations do everything already), I don't believe that it should be lawful to prevent a farmer sowing seeds.

Farmers don't save seeds anyway, and haven't done since the advent of hybrids in the 30's. subsequent generations drop in quality and consistency, so farmers buy new seeds as a matter of course. Of course if a farmer wanted to reuse seed for whatever reason, there are numerous off-patent seeds he could happily buy, but farmers tend not to buy these for a good reason.

&gt;I know this is a tangential point, but GM food threatens the organic certification simply by being present in nearby fields.

Hardly. Certification allows for small amounts of contamination, plus corn (for example) has a maximum pollen distribution radius of 200m, and at that distance it has 1% of the concentration that you get a 1m. Planting buffer zones around the edge provides a huge amount of protection. I think you're hugely overstating the concern.

&gt;After what happened to Ireland (and some of my ancestors), I'm really really wary of monocultures. GM food promotes this to some extent, so I'm against it.

Monoculture is standard practice across all agriculture? Why single out GM and not, say, hybridisation or mutagenesis?

&gt;In essence, while I think it is absolutely possible to have GM science without the business model surrounding it, we don't currently have that. If we could have GM without that I'd be happy to support it. The science doesn't bother me, but the business model does.

But patents on organic crops are A-ok? Why does it suddenly become bad depending on the seed technology?",null,0,null,1439126395,null,null,false,0,ctwu8uy,null,t3_3gajev,null,null,null,t1_ctwqgc7,null,null,null,1440373513,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

In the 'usual' scenario you give the landlord a deposit and he protects it in a special protection scheme. You pay every single month's rent in full. This means at the end of the tenancy the landlord has your deposit - that is owed to you unless the landlord can demonstrate it is appropriate to retain some of it, the burden is always on the landlord to show this. So if there is a dispute as to how much should be kept back an independent adjudicator for the protection scheme decides what is appropriate - you then get whatever is left back of your deposit from the protection scheme after this decision.

In your case there is no deposit, this is unusual. You have ""prepaid"" part of your rent - that is clearly what the wording of the contract says (questionable if appropriate but works for you).  You only have to pay ""normal rent minus £140"" in the last month. If the landlord wants money for damages he has to chase you for it - there is nothing for him to keep back from you. You don't take him to court because he doesn't have any of your money, he has to take you to court to get even a penny off you. If there is a direct debit you may want to cancel it before the last month's rent and transfer the last payment manually to make sure it is the correct amount. 

If he attempts to claim the £140 is a deposit then he has failed to protect it and you would be entitled to compensation - so he would struggle to change his mind over what the £140 is later on.

That's more than most have done and guess one of the things it has earned him, death threats.

&gt;If we accept that Muslims are key to rooting out extremism in their own community what's the point of having this smug twat which Muslims hate telling them their religion is wrong?

Well he is a Muslim and calling him names doesn't help your argument or diminish his. Another thing to note is that lots of Muslims don't hate him and those that tend to hate him are those extremists most people don't want.

&gt;Doesn't matter what I think. Muslims don't want to change their religion and it's pointless trying to make them do it. It's never gonna happen and it doesn't help in tackling extremism one iota.

Religions change all the time and you seem to have made the mistake that Maajid is trying to correct. Which is that what he does has no effect on extremism.

&gt;How about instead we open up dialogue with actual Muslims, actual Muslim community leaders, scholars, imams, and ask them what they think?

The problem we have in Britain is with Islamism, not Islam. Islamism is the politicisation of Islamic doctrine. It is a sexist, homophobic, unjust, and deeply intolerant ideology. Saudi Arabia would be a good example of Islamism in practise. 

In Britain, according to a 2006 poll, 28% of British Muslims ""hoped that Britain would one day become a fundamentalist Islamic state."" After the Charlie Hebdo attacks, a poll found that at least a quarter of British Muslims sympathised with the terrorists. That's 25% of British Muslims who support Islamic blasphemy law in Britain. That number is disturbingly high. 

The problem we have among the left is that criticising Islamism is equated with racism and bigotry towards Muslims. Yet the left are happy to criticise fascists for their beliefs. Just because a fascist is non-violent doesn't mean they should be allowed or even encouraged to spread their ideology without being challenged.

ISIS are practising Islamists. Yet Islamist preachers are funded by the government to preach in Mosques (such as East London.) It's like we are at war with a fascists regime while inviting fascist philosophers to lecture us on its virtues. It is self-harming and it needs to stop.

BHF charity shops can be great for some furniture and electricals. They make sure everything is safe and usable, and while stuff might be a little old, it'll function.

The real issue is the infrastructure cannot support it. The roads are shit, all traffic has to go through our local town to get to the other side and it's an outrageous bottleneck. The latest lot they're building is about 90-odd houses where the only access is a singe-track country lane.

There's loads of old industrial and brownfield areas which are no longer used with proximity to motorways that could be used to built towns from scratch. Fully planned out, fully capable of supporting the number of houses, and with enough schools, surgeries, etc to cater to the people there. It would take stress off existing towns and produce a shitload of jobs in the construction and manning.

But then I think about how houses are built these days and think how monumentally depressing it would probably look. Probably somewhere between something Soviet and those fake towns they used to build in America for nuke testing.

&gt;That's more than most have done and guess one of the things it has earned him, death threats.

Literally achieved nothing. 

&gt;&gt;If we accept that Muslims are key to rooting out extremism in their own community what's the point of having this smug twat which Muslims hate telling them their religion is wrong?

&gt;Well he is a Muslim and calling him names doesn't help your argument or diminish his. Another thing to note is that lots of Muslims don't hate him and those that tend to hate him are those extremists most people don't want.

He's a Muslim but he's not a mainstream Muslim and the majority of Muslims (which you are trying to get on side) don't agree with his beliefs or his actions. To say it's only extremists that hate him is exactly what's wrong with this countries approach towards Muslims. The majority hate him. The average everyday Muslim is defined by this government as extreme despite the fact they have no violent agenda, because they reject the reformist version of Islam that the government and Nawaz and Co promote. It's pointless and does nothing to tackle extremism, instead alienating the majority of Muslims in this country. 

&gt;&gt;Doesn't matter what I think. Muslims don't want to change their religion and it's pointless trying to make them do it. It's never gonna happen and it doesn't help in tackling extremism one iota.

&gt;Religions change all the time and you seem to have made the mistake that Maajid is trying to correct. Which is that what he does has no effect on extremism.

He has no effect. He is chocolate teapot but instead of chocolate the teapot is made of shit and the tea bags are metaphorical teabags of the 12 year old gamer variety. 

&gt;&gt;How about instead we open up dialogue with actual Muslims, actual Muslim community leaders, scholars, imams, and ask them what they think?

&gt;He is speaking with actual Muslims. Who do you suggest should speak to these actual Muslims and who are the actual Muslims you want to speak with? What exactly is not being done that we should be doing?

Well when the government launches an anti extremism policy and every single Muslim organisation rejects it as islamaphobic and alienating, I'm assuming it's because those same organisations were not consulted. How about we start with them. 

You can sit and pontificate all day, defending the policies of Nawaz and Quillam, pretending there's a real plan to combat extremism, but it's crap. It's crap infested crap and nothing is done to actually combat extremism. At all. Ever.

null,null,wdtpw,null,null,null,"You're being incredibly one-sided here. The question of Monsanto's rights to sue farmers for seed preservation is not only a current issue, it's a big and problematic one. You can't just brush it under the carpet by saying it isn't important. Sure, farmers in the developed world don't reuse many seeds. But a large part of the controversy about Monsanto is in the developed world, and seed reuse is important to them in a way your narrative suggests not to be the case.

Here is [just one example](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/brazil-monsanto-exporters-idUSL2N0SI0LF20141023):

&gt; Trading firms have not had to oversee royalty payments in the United States, the world's No. 2 soy exporter after Brazil, because biotech company's patents are protected by laws that do not allow farmers to reuse seeds year after year there.

&gt;In Brazil, where genetically modified seeds have only been legal since 2005, reusing seeds is more common and it is easier for farmers to skip out on Monsanto's fees after buying the seeds the first season.

I should also point out that Monsanto [by their own account is suing farmers](http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/why-does-monsanto-sue-farmers-who-save-seeds.aspx), leading to 147 cases in the US since 1997. Not a non-existent problem. In addition, of course, there is the threat of legal action:

&gt; Where we do find violations, we are able to settle most of these cases without ever going to trial.

In order for this statement to be true, of course, there would have to be an additional number of cases greater than 147, where farmers have folded without going to trial.

Likewise, Monsanto not only preserves its right to sue farmers (and does sue farmers, and threaten others with legal action even in the developed world. [It also fights to preserve its right to sue over crops that have just blown into another field](https://www.rt.com/usa/monsanto-patents-sue-farmers-547/).

There is a lot of concern around the world over the litigiousness of GM companies, and this is definitely part of the problem.

I suggest your aggressive approach to debate is another part of the problem. I don't appreciate lines like:

&gt; Learn about the topic, then create theories.

&gt; You're trying to come up with nefarious motives even though you don't know some important information.

&gt; It's people who have no knowledge of the subject making blanket assertions without understanding how it works.

Either debate the issue or don't. In either case, please lose the ad-hominims.",null,0,null,1439128901,null,null,1439129820,0,ctwv6ep,null,t3_3gajev,null,null,null,t1_ctwuvej,null,null,null,1440374017,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,dtiftw,null,null,null,"&gt;You can't just brush it under the carpet by saying it isn't important. Sure, farmers in the developed world don't reuse many seeds. But a large part of the controversy about Monsanto is in the developed world, and seed reuse is important to them in a way your narrative suggests not to be the case. 

This thread is about Scotland. Not a third world country.

&gt; It also fights to preserve its right to sue over crops that have just blown into another field[2] .


[This is a blatant and malicious lie. Monsanto has never, ever sued farmers for accidental contamination. They have stated in a US court that they never will.](http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/gm-seed-accidentally-in-farmers-fields.aspx) Yes, Monsanto has sued farmers who intentionally and willfully violate their contracts. Just like any other company would. But 147 lawsuits over nearly two decades when millions of farmers use their seeds? That's not a lot. 


&gt;Either debate the issue or don't. In either case, lose the ad-hominims.

It's not an ad hominem attack. It's pointing out that you are presenting personal opinions on a topic where you don't know some of the basic facts.

The article I linked said:

Now you might suggest that Monsanto won't ever make use of that right, but my statement is accurate and precise. They did indeed fight to preserve their rights to sue over the issue.

null,null,SufferSome,null,null,null,"&gt; I think it's important to have a clear narrative on these things. Either:
a) Farmers don't save seeds, so it isn't important. Therefore no-one will complain if we legislate to say Monsanto can't restrict the rights of farmers to save seeds.
or
b) Monsanto gets a lot of value out of preventing farmers from saving seeds, so they will fight this tooth and nail.
I suspect (b). What do you think?

This is not a sensible comparison to make. There is a non-trivial issue here that follows from the genetics of crop species.

Heterosis is what gives hybrid vigour to crops, and is what stops people from saving seed - in effect, the seed supplier has used nature to enforce an effective license, whereby they sell seed that is only really good for a single generation. The genetic variation giving rise to heterosis is diffuse and fragile, hence the second generation of plants growing much less well. Funnily enough, nobody seems to complain much that these mega-corporations sell seed that isn't good for a second generation.

With GM crops the genes that give rise to high yield can be extremely localised, and these genes are often recessive. So seed saved from GM crops may still be more productive than other varieties.

So both a) and b) are true, actually.

By stopping licensing of GM crops you're giving a false competitive advantage to traditional breeding.",null,0,null,1439131325,null,null,false,0,ctww7zg,null,t3_3gajev,null,null,null,t1_ctwukix,null,null,null,1440374509,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Cedric: 4 - can't defend. If he wasn't subbed off he would've been sent off.

Targett: 4 - completely out of his depth. 

Fonte: 6 - not his best day at the office, but held things together in an atrocious back four.

Yoshida: 5 - Panicky, sloppy, an accident waiting to happen.

Wanyama: 6 - looked like he couldn't be arsed at times. Passing was appalling, but he won some tackles. 

Davis: 9 MOTM - put in an amazing shift, playing out of position, working like a beast to put out the numerous fires. 

Tadic: 7 - some good work on the ball, bit feeble under pressure still. Better than he was in the second half of last season.

Mane: 7 - left his first touch at home, sadly, but always looked dangerous even though he barely had the ball under control. 

Rodriguez: 5 - surprised he started. He's not fit by a long shot.

Pelle: 7 - pretty sharp. Fantastic header for the goal.

(subs)

Martina: 7 - far more solid than Cedric. 

Long: 7 - I was actually wondering if he'd even touched the ball since coming on when he rose like a salmon and buried a cracking header.

Targett - 'a learning curve' would be the nicest way to describe his game today. Harsh fact is he was the weak link today against a good Newcastle attack. Needs to learn and improve.

Tadic - This was the Tadic we saw at the start of last season. Hopefully it lasts all season long this time.

Davis - I really don't like Davis, but every now and again he will do something that reminds us why he's played at a high level all through his career.

Soares - Caught off guard a bit at the back but what a cross for Pelle.

Martina - Did the basics well and nothing flamboyant. Helped to stabilize the team later in the game.

Hard to judge how strong a team we are until Clasie and Bertrand return and we've finished our transfer business.

**Positives**

- Our defense as a whole looks much, much stronger. We actually seem to know where we're supposed to be.

- Payet is sick, nothing new, just reiterating 

- Oxford is definitely one for the future. If you're able to keep control of Ozil and the rest of the Arsenal attack at the age of 16, I look forward to what you'll be able to do at the age of 20 and onwards. 

- Passing overall has improved an incredible amount from last year. First time I've seen us pull off a sick triangle in years (77th min or thereabouts is what im specifically referring to)

**Negatives**

With regards to young drinkers, there is definitely an over-drinking problem where they will crush 8 beers or half a bottle of vodka before they head out, or in the streets from an off license before they go in.

These are the same people that give the night time economy a bad name which results on police, councils and the press coming down hard on the clubs... Never the supermarkets/off licenses

If the bars could earn more, than they could do more to make patrons safe and increase the standards that they already have to do to be responsible.

Many venues now have increased security (£15 an hour mostly - doorstaff see about £10 of this from the company they work for), beach patrols, licensed managers, licensed door-staff, training to staff, ID scanners that cost a lot to purchase and sometimes run.  All these are things the venues themselves do and supermarkets don't shoulder the cost or blame.

The standards you have uphold to operate in a big city like Brighton are very high and it's tough to find good management because it costs money to get experienced management.  In brighton, with the exception of a few, there are 20 year old general managers that don't know what they are doing.  This is because the business cant afford decent management. Time and time again these venues go under, have violence and failed underage police test purchases.

Quality Staffing for what is now an intense standards industry is only going to get worse when the £7.20 minimum wage comes in for over 25s and venues are forced to hire young to make budgets comes in.  Some of the bigger venues already aim for under 21's so they can pay lower than £6.50 an hour to meet labour budget.

However, in the episode they were able to rewrite their personal history and create a new time line that allowed Gallifrey to be saved. 

With Gallifrey saved, the Doctor was able to avoid the time line where he died on Trenzalore and Matt Smith's Doctor was his last incarnation.

That all happened because when the War Doc, 10 and 11 were ready to be good soldiers and blow up Gallifrey,  a companion was there who had seen the resulting Doctor from dealing with this for hundreds of years and she made them second guess the decision.

I could understand them wanting to sit on the bench at the likes of City &amp; Chelsea while pocketing a massive contract though, happens time and time again with players like Sinclair and Rodwell. 

However, Austin would be great fit as he's similar to Kane, so the system wouldn't need to change, and Berahino would be work as a Plan B &amp; he can play out wide with his pace can't he?

Oxford really is class. Over a year ago he was playing at the Emirates with the U15s, now he's playing at the Emirates with the first team keeping World Cup and Euro winners in his back pocket. The way he played in midfield was outstanding.

Payet was brilliant too, Zarate was a little selfish but worked hard. Would've like to see Sakho score but he played well. Kouyate was a tank and Ogbonna and Reid look solid. Oxford has looked good in centre back and in midfield, so we've definitely got a gem here.

The only arguments that they ""caused it"" focus on lax banking regulation. But it was unlikely the tories would have been stricter so that's a bit irrelevant. 

The point is that you won't find many people arguing that labour ""caused the financial crisis"" by overspending.

I can't believe how good we looked today, every single player was incredible. The defense was rock solid, Tomkins was great at right back. Oxford didn't look out of place at all, was so composed all game. And what a player Payet looks, constant threat, keeps possession and linked up with Sakho and Zarate so well. 
 
The biggest improvement for me was the way we didn't just hoof it out of defense all the time, we actually played it on the floor. With Allardyce at 2-0 up we would have had, 11 behind the ball and hoofed it out only for it to come back straight away. But I suppose we should be careful what we wish for.

null,null,kidfarthing,null,null,null,"Hey, event organiser here.


Forgive me if this comes off a little testy as I just woke up after finally getting out of the venue at 8am after the pack down.


Food and shisha were in the courtyard - not really sure how you missed this as it was right in front of you when you entered the site. We served kebabs, burgers, hotdogs, sides etc. and, yes, shisha. I even made a personal arrangement with the venue management to allow a guest, who didn't want any of the food available, to be able to order a pizza! 

I can also 100% guarantee that there were enough seats for everyone. I know how many people came and I know how many seats were in the space; as we put every single one of them down individually, tested for possible visibility issues etc. Some people chose to stand, others may have had trouble locating groups of seats that met their requirements (especially if they arrived a little late!). Again, I was seating/ushering people who asked for help. Including shuffling people around to make space for people who needed to sit close because of visual impairments or central because of being hard of hearing.

I suggest, in future, if you are having trouble finding something at an event such as ours you simply ask a member of the bar staff/crew (there were 6 of us - all wearing bright purple t-shirts with 'crew' on the back) rather than stewing on it and ultimately creating a bad time for yourself.

I say 'creating a bad time for yourself' as, in my humble opinion, 99% of the people who came had an absolute blast. I've been organising events on this scale for a year and a half now and have never seen such an overwhelmingly positive response! My buddy and I (organisers) are a 2-man show and do absolutely everything ourselves. That whole room was an empty space on thursday - speakers, bar fridges, tables, projectors, DJ equipment etc. etc. were all ours. It took us around 24 hrs to fully set up the room and we didn't leave until it was empty again.

Having said all of the above I want to stress that I am genuinely interested in constructive criticism (I think we can both agree that ""pretty fucking shit"" is not massively constructive) and, if you're a dota fan, you'll *want* to give this as you happen to be unlucky enough to live in one of the hardest cities in the world in which to pull off an event like this. Exorbitant venue hire prices, ingrained negative attitudes towards gaming (let alone eSports!), high alcohol prices make putting on events like this pretty much a labour of love. If you want people to keep doing them (and to improve!) you should ""measure ur words"" a little more carefully.

Headmasters are essentially executive managers of a school. They are viewed as prominent members of society in the area, as they're responsible for the shaping and cultivating of youths within the school. A large secondary school (where they would be earning this six figures) can employ hundreds of members of staff and be responsible for thousands of youths. It's a very influential role to anyone with children, and a lot of people have children. You are probably also drastically underestimating how many staff they're responsible for. Schools are also very large employers. Putting aside teachers, there's endless support staff and administrative staff that are ultimately responsible to the headteacher (or his delegates). A large school is essentially a company with several thousand clients and several hundred contractors/employees, and the senior manager gets paid accordingly.

Schools in general have issues though. [Teachers have been saying they're underpaid and overworked for decades](https://www.the-newshub.com/uk-politics/i-quit-the-ever-increasing-workload-of-the-british-teacher) and [that's something that has been backed up to some extent by people looking at the industry](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10923967/OECD-teachers-overworked-and-not-valued-by-society.html).

I'm not saying that government parties should be punished if due to circumstances out of their control (like the circumstances changing drastically) they can't fulfil a manifesto pledge. What I mean is that political parties shouldn't be able to do exactly what the Tories did this election which is say one thing and then go ""only joking, we're going to do something completely different instead"" when they get elected.

Basically, I'm saying that such an independent body would investigate if the party even attempted to fulfil or had any intention of fulfilling the points in its manifesto. I mean I know student politics doesn't translate into reality, but my old university used to do this for executive officer candidates, and it worked quite well to stamp out people just making populist statements to win an election (in this case the system was that at the end of the term, the elected candidate had to write a retrospective report on their manifesto pointing out how they fulfilled their manifesto promises, and where they didn't explain why they didn't. If the reason for not fulfilling the promise wasn't deemed suitable enough by the accountabilities committee then the candidate would receive a fine for each promise broken without valid justification).",null,0,null,1439132950,null,null,1439133191,0,ctwwyb7,null,t3_3g4tvy,null,null,null,t1_ctwwsrh,null,null,null,1440374854,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

* Start a new government department to manage rail franchises.

* Benchmark all the franchises to find out which are the worst run and worst performing. 

* Pick the worst performing one and let its contract expire, then bring it back into public hands and let the government department that was set up run it. 

* Has it managed to do a better job than the people that had the franchise originally? If no, shut down the program. Keep the status quo. If yes, then success! Time to expand. 

* The franchise currently in government hands is now the benchmark for the whole industry. Any franchises benchmarking lower than it are eligible to have their contract expire and be taken back into public hands. 

* As the amount of franchises in public hands grows, we start using the average benchmark across all government managed franchises and the minimum standard. 

Then you keep repeating the process. But it should work both way.. If somehow this results in the governments franchise/s being the worst performing then the contracts should be left to expire and offered to the highest performing rail company to take over. 

This would allow for healthy competition, and makes the most sense, imo. The aim shouldn't be to re-nationalize everything for the sake of it. It should only happen when the government can actually improve on service. 

I believe that plan would raise the quality of service across the whole network, as the fear of losing your franchise to the government for under performance should give the private companies the kick up the arse needed to provide a better service.

Davis didn't look comfortable so far back and often it seemed like Wanyama against the whole Newcastle midfield. 

Targett was really disappointing. Not just getting breezed past, but on the ball he was so panicked and kept giving it away so cheaply. It didn't help him either that JRod left him totally exposed with a lack of help down that side.

Fonte and Yoshi both looked slow and troubled by most things that came at them, which was really worrying.

JRod didn't seem anywhere near ready to be playing.

Pelle I thought played really well, he had to drop deep to put pressure on the newcastle midfield and his distribution was nice to go with that great header.

Tadic was the only one of the trio of Mane/Tadic/JRod who caused trouble for the most part. His play on the right and crossing looked dangerous.

Cedric looked tremendous going forwards, but a liability against Newcastle's big, strong forwards. His only answer seemed to be to pull them back or trip them, which is worrying going forward.

The idea of Martina coming on didn't fill me with confidence, but I thought out there he looked the most assured of the defenders. Calm and collected defending and stopped players breezing past us on that side and was happy to jump forward when the chance arose.

Long made a real difference coming on. He dropped deeper to give more options for the midfield when we had the ball and got in there really well for his goal. Disappointed he didn't start with how JRod didn't look really what-so-ever.


We recovered well in the last 20/25 minutes, but the draw was a bit of a let off for the way we let them breeze past us with their big, athletic players time and time again.

She may be - Doctor Who is already notable for having Jack, the first specifically non-heterosexual heroic main character in a major family show. Not to mention the many other non-heterosexual characters who only appeared in one or two episodes. She may not be - but it *still matters that she was cast.* And it still matters that people know she was cast.

Because even just 5 years ago, there's no chance she would have been. Ten years ago casting her on a family show would have been unthinkable. Articles like this matter, because trans kids are seeing this. They see the articles, they know Bethany is trans, and when they see Bethany on Doctor Who they're seeing someone like themselves on their favorite show.

Kids like [**this little girl**](https://celebrity.yahoo.com/blogs/celeb-news/laverne-cox-meets-7-year-old-transgender-girl-words-of-wisdom-161812805.html), a 7 year old trans girl who met Laverne Cox recently. For this little girl Laverne is a role model and idol, an example of a grown-up trans woman who is successful and respected. Laverne is an image of what this little girl can imagine her own adult life to be like.

Of course, at 7 she's much too young to actually see Laverne act in *""Orange Is the New Black.""* There are very few out trans actors on television, and until now they've all been cast in shows that aren't appropriate for children. There will be young trans kids who see articles about Bethany's casting, who know she's trans just like they are, and for the first time they can watch and enjoy her performance on a show specifically meant to be enjoyed by children.

And cisgender kids will see these articles, and see Bethany on the show, and have a slightly increased idea of what it means to be trans. Until recently there were *no* out trans people in popular media, and what depictions of trans people did exist were overwhelmingly grotesque parodies played by cisgender actors. Cisgender children growing up never saw trans people treated with dignity or respect. In just the last few years, that has started to change. And casting Bethany is part of that change.

And yea, if her character isn't trans a lot of people will see her on the show and never realize she is. But a lot of people will know, in particular other producers and networks. When they see that a trans actor was on a family show and the sky didn't fall, the advertisers didn't jump ship, and enraged parents didn't storm the studio, they'll be more likely to cast trans actors on other family shows as well.

My benefits work something like this: I get x amount of money to spend on a list of benefits such as health and dental insurance.

I'm trying to figure out how to get the most value from this situation as possible.

As the extra pay is going to give me about am extra £1,000 on top of my base salary of £17,500, my adjusted salary becomes £18,500 over the 12 month placement. As my placement spans 2 tax years in the proportion of 9 months and 3 months with individual adjusted salaries of £13,875 and £4,625, by taking the cash option, 3/4 of it will be taxable.

Say that you can only build 140 flats instead of 160 because one of your twenty floors is shops and you've had to sacrifice space elsewhere to fit in some green spaces, public spaces etc.

Now the 20 million building costs are split between less properties, pushing the minimum price from £125K to £140K before you consider that there's got to be a profit margin there somewhere for everyone involved which probably pushes those houses into more expensive territory.

On top of that, you have to buy/rent out those shop spaces to people, introducing greater running costs to the building which may be offset by the commerical rental fees but are still going to add a premium *to* those rental fees.

null,null,brokenairguitar,flair5,,null,"I think Shaqiri's quality is undeniable. He's incredibly strong, has good acceleration, great close ball control and some fairly good finishing ability. I've never known him to be a top notch passer and he's got the reputation as being a bit selfish in terms of offensive vision. I can't recall whether he tracks back on defense, but my memory is that he's not the best at that, either.

The simple answer to the question of whether Shaq could do a job here is undeniably yes. He's got enough quality that he would contribute positively to our squad.

The more complicated answer is probably that Pochettino would have to change his offense and roles of other players to accommodate a wild card like Shaqiri who sort of will just do his own thing. This is probably unfit for Poch's philosophy of total pressing defense and free-form offense.

So Poch and co. probably don't rate Shaq for our club because the fee+wages+headache of changing playing style (even if it's only a little) is not worth the incremental value of having that extra wild card in the offense, especially if we assume that his unpredictability will stifle the flow of other offensive players who are rather good at finding each other (e.g. Kane, Eriksen).

I personally thought Gueye had an excellent game while Westwood was anonymous. Veretout has some decent touches, but all in all it looked like there was a serious lack of communication amongst the three. At one point in the first half, our midfield were all playing deep in a flat line, which does us no good for linking up our front three. They need to develop a shape. 

I think part of the reason we saw improvement in the second half was because they got a little more comfortable, and figured out where they needed to be. They got a little less reserved. I'm sure we will see this change over the coming weeks. I'm hoping to see Westwood/Sanchez staying deep, Gueye running amok all over the pitch, and Veretout linking up to our front three.

It's also important to note that Gil and Grealish were both out, and their return will change things, Gabby can't lead a line, and it has been said numerous times that Ayew doesn't have the development to play along the wing. Those last two were tactical errors in my opinion, which changed when Gusted came on, and won't happen again when we get Gil and Grealish back.",null,0,null,1439135339,null,null,false,0,ctwy30f,null,t3_3gc2r0,null,null,null,t3_3gc2r0,null,null,null,1440375386,null,2,null,avfc,t5_2s569,2,null

Our 3 attacking players behind Benteke have been poor and unfortunately most chances we create will come through them. 

Benteke has looked to run in behind the defence and I feel it'll take one good pass from Coutinho or Lallana and he'll be through which is encouraging. 

Looking forward to seeing what changes Rodgers will do. He could go 4-4-2 diamond with Ings on and Ibe off. He could do 4-2-2-2 if he wants to go all out. Or he might pull a Rodgers from last year and bring out a random formation that most players don't know how to play. Who knows.

Henderson seems leashed and kinda has seemed so since going to this system with Milner. Necessary for defensive cover but that doesn't help our attack. 

Defense doesn't look terrible though. A bit solid. Gomez looks pretty good, but I'd say he definitely is raw as well. Johnson's chance started with his mid judgement of the ball.

For a team and a manager with it all to prove and demons to exorcise that was underwhelming. 

The positives are that the defence looks more solid and our new fullbacks are both solid and can play football. Benteke is also mobile, hard-working, and is willing to do the work. We need to stop playing it to his head, and get him more involved. 

The downside is that we don't look like a team that is going to be imposing its game. Stoke were all too willing to pack 10 men behind the ball and we still couldn't keep much possession. Milner and Henderson don't look like a complementary partnership and might struggle to control midfields by themselves.

Need to find a way to allow Gomez and Clyne to push up because when they have done we've broken down Stoke's organization. If Lallana doesn't involve himself in the first 10-15 minutes of the second half then he's got to come off for either Can or Firmino if he's fit enough, we need to keep possession in their third of the pitch and get them chasing.

Their squad is just not that good. Wenger has been too cheap for too long, and relies too much on players which should be rotation options but, inexplicably, get defended as world-class by idiots.

Let's play a game. I call this game ""How many of your XI would start on most other EPL teams?""

**Chelsea**. Courtois, Costa, Hazard, Oscar, Ivanovic, Fabregas, potentially Terry would all be in the XI of any other team in the EPL. That's 6-7 players, all of which are of very high quality, high enough to play for any other team.

**City**. Kompany (I know last year was bad, but he'd still start), Sterling, Aguero, Nasri, Yaya Toure, potentially Joe Hart. That's 4-6 players.

**United**. This one's harder because they have good players, but they aren't gelling. Still, you could safely say: Mata, De Gea, Rooney, Smalling, Schweinsteiger, potentially Depay and potentially Phil Jones. That's 7.

**Arsenal**. Sanchez, Ozil, Cech, potentially Mertesacker, and .... Rosicky? Mathieu ""Free transfer"" Flamini? No fucking way. Arsenal have 3-4 top-tier players, tops.

Arsenal have a squad full of squad players. They do not have a squad full of superstars, like their competitors do. That's why they're not title contenders, even with Cech. I don't play FIFA, but outside the three I just mentioned, I would put almost every Arsenal player rated at like 70-80.

2. Even if a fire is more likely to start from carelessness than anything else, I'm not willing to gamble to lives of my family on me never being careless. I'm a very fire-conscious person, but like everyone I get tired or stressed or forgetful, add elderly people, pets or children to a house and 'just be careful' becomes silly advice. Even the most mentally-sound adult is likely to accidentally leave an oven on overnight at least once, why risk it?

3. The reasons these fire doors are installed anyway is not overfully-careful planning for a danger that isn't really there. It's a reaction to hundreds of people who have died who wouldn't have if there had been fire doors.

4. I've been living in student accommodation with fire doors for 4 years now, going home over the holidays to my parents' house which doesn't have fire doors. It's such a minor thing, I've never considered the difference until now. Need to keep a door open? Wedge it open. They save lives. Costs and benefits...

Side Note. If you were to build your argument on the fact that a fire is never going to happen, ok, I'd disagree with that fact but the logic would be ok. But you said ""once in 20 years"".

null,null,CaptainHayashi,,Labour Member | Corbyn/Eagle,null,"Honestly, I don't think Clause 4 needs to be changed back.  Not that I don't agree with old C4 or a hypothetical Jez C4, but the current one we have defines every part of the party without leaving out any of the broad church.

But, applying a bit of devil's advocate and a metric tonne of speculation, I would say that Jeremy (and some of his supporters) want Labour to have nationalisation back as an _a priori_, defining pillar of the movement, and that changing Clause 4 would be the most symbolically powerful way of doing so.  For some parts of Labour, nationalisation and being a workers' party are so heavily intertwined that this is perfectly rational and logical.

Again going for the DA here, having a Clause 4 that ties Labour to a specific means is a step towards giving Labour a strongly defined vision for the country.  If it says on the membership cards that Labour is a party that wants to secure common ownership of the fruits of workers' labour, then that's a stronger idea to start planning manifesto commitments from.  Of course, the flip side (and part of why I'm not really sold on a C4 change) is that it alienates huge swathes of the current Labour party, and further stifles debate on the correct way forwards.  It's fairly evident in this subreddit alone that a lot of people here _don't_ think that nationalisation is what Labour should be doing.

Anyway. if he gets elected as leader, then he has the mandate to at least put that idea to the party.  From here, this can go one of four ways:

* Jeremy doesn't get in, making the whole issue moot;
* Jeremy gets in and promptly doesn't touch Clause 4 in any way, again making the issue moot;
* Jeremy gets in and starts a fully democratic discussion on Labour's purpose, which results either in Labour redefining as a nationalisation party (by rewriting or reversing C4), or by the party opting not to do so;
* Jeremy gets in and _forces_ a C4 moment, at which point he shows himself to supporters and opponents alike that he _isn't_ the man the party voted in, and quite honestly at this point I'd reconsider my support.

So, really, I'd say there's not a lot to fear here.  Either any C4 change comes about due to a process that has considered the views of everyone in Labour, or Jeremy shoots himself in the foot and gives the party a good reason to bring the knives out for him.",null,0,null,1439136644,null,null,false,0,ctwyqxr,null,t3_3gak2k,null,null,null,t1_ctwwtsw,null,null,null,1440375699,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

The idea that the public votes party because they promised X only for the party not to do X when they get into power is absurd.

Though honestly I would prefer that parties would be honest and say they don't have all the answers and that all they can really do is promise a general direction, than to just outright lie to the public.

(EDIT: of course, though, my proposal would have to be predicated on the idea of other legislation forcing full government transparency - unless it's a matter of national security that the information isn't released, I think it is only right that all the facts and figures about the state of the country should be made available before an election. Otherwise, the ruling party would always have the advantage as they know the actual figures and thus could always come up with a concrete plan.

&gt;Taken together, Monsanto’s representations unequivocally disclaim any intent to sue appellant growers, seed sellers, or organizations for inadvertently using or selling “trace amounts” of genetically modified seeds. …. We conclude that Monsanto has disclaimed any intent to sue inadvertent users or sellers of seeds that are inadvertently contaminated with up to one percent of seeds carrying Monsanto’s patented traits.



&gt;While Monsanto’s representations are not a covenant not to sue, they have a similar effect. If we rely on Monsanto’s representations to defeat the appellants’ declaratory judgment claims (as we do), those representations are binding as a matter of judicial estoppel. It is well established that a party who successfully argues one position is estopped from later adopting a contrary position in a case involving the same patent.

Any farmer sued by Monsanto over accidental contamination can now simply cite the case and the binding estoppel.

&gt;They did indeed fight to preserve their rights to sue over the issue.

That was not the case. I have linked it for you to read yourself.

&gt;it was your doubling down on ad-hominim combined with the use of the word ""malicious.""

Saying that you don't understand the topic you're commenting on is not an ad hominem attack. It isn't. Your lack of information directly affects the validity of your opinion.

And yes, I used malicious. That's what it is when people purposefully spread lies about something. The fact that you found a news outlet that spread the lies doesn't change the fact that there's no truth to them.

&gt;

Serious question, more for you to think about than answer here: are you personally involved with the agricultural business in some way? 

No. But I get called a shill all the time. That's what happens when someone with an interest in a subject and knowledge about it tries to confront a popular narrative here on Reddit. 


&gt;you appear to be emotionally caught up in it enough to feel it's okay to insult your debating opponent rather than discuss the facts.

null,null,theinspectorst,null,null,null,"&gt;In 2010, as in 2015, three prominent New Labourites stood at one end of the spectrum, with a token left-winger at the other. The major difference is that, this time round, there is no longer anyone standing between these polar extremes of Labour politics. The difference is that there is no Ed Miliband.

In 2010, one of those 'prominent New Labourites' - indeed, the most prominent and most unashamedly New Labourite of them - defeated Ed Miliband among Labour Party members in *every round* of the vote. David Miliband got 44% of the votes of Labour Party members in the first round alone (vs Ed's 30%), rising to 54% by the final round (vs Ed's 46%).

So if it were taking place among the same electorate as 5 years ago, even if every Ed Miliband supporter now voted for Corbyn, there would still be a clear New Labour majority among Labour Party members.

I think what has happened is that the electorate has actually changed (in composition and attitudes) significantly. Some of the centrists have left, disillusioned with the Ed Miliband years. There's been an influx of trade union members (who were the ones who overturned the vote of the party members in 2010) as a result of the reform of Labour's electoral college. And some of the pragmatists have decided for the first time to go against Blair's advise and vote with their 'hearts not heads'.",null,0,null,1439136949,null,null,false,0,ctwywkx,null,t3_3gcx0w,null,null,null,t3_3gcx0w,null,null,null,1440375773,null,11,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,11,null

Well I disagree. I think it has achieved something. It has made people realize that those extremists and so-called Muslim leaders aren't really representative of a lot of Muslims. It has made people realize that there are liberal Muslims.

&gt;He's a Muslim but he's not a mainstream Muslim and the majority of Muslims (which you are trying to get on side) don't agree with his beliefs or his actions. To say it's only extremists that hate him is exactly what's wrong with this countries approach towards Muslims. The majority hate him.

If the majority hate him, then it shows the problem with the majority and further reveals why voices like his are needed.

&gt;The average everyday Muslim is defined by this government as extreme despite the fact they have no violent agenda, because they reject the reformist version of Islam that the government and Nawaz and Co promote. It's pointless and does nothing to tackle extremism, instead alienating the majority of Muslims in this country.

Well the views expressed my a significant number of Muslims are extreme. Most may not want to carry out violent acts that doesn't mean they don't support those violent acts. I think it does a lot to tackle extremism. What do you think should be done to tackle extremism?

&gt;He has no effect. He is chocolate teapot but instead of chocolate the teapot is made of shit and the tea bags are metaphorical teabags of the 12 year old gamer variety. 

This is an empty assertion you need more substance.

&gt;Well when the government launches an anti extremism policy and every single Muslim organisation rejects it as islamaphobic and alienating, I'm assuming it's because those same organisations were not consulted. How about we start with them.

Which policy or policies are you referring to?

&gt;You can sit and pontificate all day, defending the policies of Nawaz and Quillam, pretending there's a real plan to combat extremism, but it's crap. It's crap infested crap and nothing is done to actually combat extremism. At all. Ever.

null,null,IcedThatGuy,null,null,null,"Loved Eccelston. After everything, I miss him the most. I loved him before he was The Doctor, and his portrayal is my favorite. He has a bitterness and pent-up anger that no other actor has been able to adequately portray. He lays the groundwork for one of The Doctor's longest running arcs, and, without him, I just don't think the story would be as powerful. In my opinion,The Doctor, after Eccelston, (no spoilers) attains a cheerines that is essential to the character, but without the 9th Doctor's heat, the lightheartedness would have less meaning in the end. Where other actors portray this aspect of the character with sorrow, Eccelston plays it with so much more hate and fire, and I love those aspects of him. I really wish he stayed, but in the long run, it makes sense why that version of him burned quickly.

edit: Tennant is awesome, as it Matt Smith. They bring back a lot of the previous Doctor's aspects that Eccelston, naturally, had to shed, but his doctor was so unique

That number is disturbingly high.

&gt;The problem we have among the left is that criticising Islamism is equated with racism and bigotry towards Muslims.

No it isn't, this entire thread is one massive strawman circlejerk. 

Have you seriously not seen people on the left criticising Saudi Arabia, or Islam in politics? This is such utter bullshit, you've all made up an argument. 

&gt;Yet Islamist preachers are funded by the government to preach in Mosques (such as East London.)

source?

We also have bishops in the house of lords and a church of England subsidised by the taxpayer, but that's the crux of this whole thread, this isn't actually about criticising religion equally, it's about singling out Islam.

&gt;Plans to build 45,000 new homes on many of Cardiff’s last unprotected green spaces have sparked a huge outcry among communities near the proposed developments.

&gt;There are fears the picturesque northern fringe of the city will lose its semi-rural appeal and be choked by traffic jams if proposals to build massive suburbs go-ahead.

&gt;As exclusively revealed by the Echo, the Labour-controlled Cardiff council has unveiled its draft blueprint for future development.

&gt;The draft Local Development Plan (LDP) Preferred Strategy says 45,400 new homes are needed as the city’s population swells 26% to 408,000 by 2026. Of these, 18,250 homes would be built on greenfield sites.

Cardiff is an anomaly in Wales, typically Welsh house prices are affordable IF you do not live in Cardiff, if there's one place that needs affordable new homes its there. The comment about traffic jams is a fair one, Cardiff cannot handle a huge volume of traffic and I don't see any initiatives to help the transport infrastructure.",null,0,null,1439137598,null,null,false,0,ctwz8rx,null,t3_3gbyw3,null,null,null,t1_ctwrb72,null,null,null,1440375933,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,null,volunteer24601,null,null,null,"OK, let's do this

a) Cooper has her skeletons, its true. But you can't get a perfect candidate. And in fact she is using her experience, and achievements as reasons to vote for her -- most notably sure start centres. And the skeletons she has is nothing compared to what Corbyn has. Over the years he has said dozens of absolutely toxic things and associated with very dodgy groups. Do you want Osborne to channel his inner Thatcher and start talking about the Falklands? Because Corbyn is on record as wanting to give the Falklands, war graves and all, to Argentina. That'll play well to the UKIP voters.. Corbyn has just so many toxic opinions and associations, from Venezuela, to Putin, to Iran, the IRA, Hamas,  Kosovo etc etc. Corbyn isn't being smeared, he's being scrutinised (mostly, Tony Blair can shut up)

As for UKIP voters and Euroscepticism, it's too late. Labour is associated with being pro-EU and the vast majority of MPs and members are. Labour should fight for a yes vote next june, and Corbyn would actually piss off his most natural supporters (the urban, young liberal multicultural wing) by taking an anti-EU line.

b) Still nope! Lots of young people are on social media, but may just post about their weekends, or holidays, or friends. Even of the  40% who vote once every 5 years, most won't be constantly engaged in politics. Again I'd compare it to student politics - loud minorities are very loud, but still not a majority.

c) Until a few months ago, the SNP were still pledging to cut corporation tax. They've had no serious scrutiny, as things in Scotland are increasingly divided along nationalist-unionist lines. It's nationalism and Labour could resurrect Karl Marx and elect him as leader, and the SNP would still be hugely popular.

As for austerity - Labour backed it because it's the only way not to look irresponsible. Austerity will always be popular or at least accepted by swing voters because it is ""common sense"" The idea that you can't spend more than you are earning strikes people as more true than any neo-marxist jargon about economic systems. 

I actually think the whole concept of 'austerity' is way overblown. It's simply spending cuts. That's all it is. Being 'anti-austerity' is a nice label but it doesn't mean anything unless you state you are going to spend more and explain where the money is going to come from. And it has to come from borrowing or taxation, which makes Labour look irresponsible or mean (nobody like taxes) And as much as I want all tax loopholes to be closed, high-powered accountants are very clever. You may get some more tax revenue but it's crazy to base an economic platform on it. Backing some form of austerity is just poitically necessary - 90% of voters in 2015 voted for a party backing some sort of austerity. Again, taking an 'anti-austerity' line would do more damage to Labour electability and simply its credibility

d) I also don't want to live in a society that is anti-immigrant or anti-welfare or selfish. But we have to work with the electorate we have and not the electorate we want. And saying what's the point being elected on a moderate platform ignores all the achievement that Labour governments have managed, from the Open University to the Minimum wage. Labour governments inevitably disappoint supporters (all political careers end in failure) but Labour achives far more in government than it does in opposition. The bedroom tax would have been abolished if Labour had won, and the mansion tax would have been introduced . Idealism is very well and good, but pragmatism makes change.

Bernie Sanders also won't win the democratic nomination IMO, he'll put up a show and lose to Hillary. And if the Republicans could put up a decent candidate (i.e. not Trump) then they could very well beat Sanders. America is very right wing. Republican primaries also show the danger of appealing to the faithful and ignoring the general public.

Natalie Bennett cost Labour 12 seats. Bad, not catastrophic. Corbyn would cost more by driving away centrist and swing voters. Corbyn isn't putting 'left-wing' ideas into the mainstream, he's putting them into the left-wing Labour party election. Likewise, Burnham is changing positions in an internal election. Corbyn IMO would actually make it easier for the Tories to go to the right, as without credible opposition they again become the natural party of government. That's how Thatcher was able to get away with so much - her education and NHS reforms weren't that popular, but people did not trust Labour with the economy. 

E) Nice guy sure, but I've heard him described as being seen as Tony Benn to the right of the party and Tony Blair to the left. A political chameleon. 

f) A Labour split is unlikely, just 5 years of vicious in-fighting. Corbyn has rebelled against the whip 535 times, he has no ability to call for unity. Corbyn is winning because he is providing hope and idealism. Two things that are great for a party that was crushed in the election a few months ago. All his major supporters cite his 'principles' and his 'straight-talking' but that is not enough if the general public think your principles are out-dated and nuts. Internal elections are not the same as general elections. 

The Left-wing is in crisis everywhere in the advanced democratic world and in the last year have lost elections in the UK, Poland, Israel and Denmark (that I know of) Canada is having an election, but there are right-wing governments in Australia, New Zealand, Germany etc. The only places where they are suceeding are in Spain and Greece, where there is 25% unemployment and economic chaos. Populist hard-left candidates are making lots of noise, but aren't suceeding at the ballot box..

Don't compare IDS as Minister at the DWP in 2015, to IDS as leader of the Tories in 2001. Before he got his mitts on any power, IDS was just another Tory leader - in fact he was known as quite soft and the 'quiet man of politics' The point I made is that he won over the Tory base, but failed to make any impact with the public and was removed by his own party. This is what will happen to Corbyn if he wins. 

I fully believe that Corbyn will be an utter disaster. The best comparison to him isn't actually Michael Foot. It's Ken Livingstone in 2012. They are both very similar politically. Ken was the candidate for the most left-wing part of the UK. The Labour party in London is huge and is a machine, with an army of volunteers. It was at the depths of the government's unpopularity in 2012. And Ken lost *to Boris Johnson* 

Whatever happens we are still dealing with a Tory government, and that is something I want to fix. 

You're final sentence is perhaps the most telling of everything you've said. Labour loses when it doesn't understand it's opponents. Until you understand why people are voting for the Tories (and that they aren't evil) you can't try to win them back.

Couple that regulatory responsibility with the point you made about labour building up a significant deficit even as the economy rapidly grew, and I think it's entirely fair to say they carry a lot of blame for how bad the effects of the financial crisis were.

If it has been referred to the police by the hospital (which does not always happen even though it probably should) then the police will create a ""skeleton"" report until they can get in contact with a victim. I would definitely urge the customer to contact the police and report the incident if they wish to proceed with it. Generally, the owner is held to account for actions of the dog under the law, but a court can also make an order for the dog to be put down under certain circumstances.

I haven't had a major amount of involvement with this sort of crime but I know several colleagues who have, so I'm basing this on conversations I've had with them about the issue and my own knowledge about reporting crime and the legislation. 

*^Disclaimer ^though, ^I'm ^a ^PC ^in ^England, ^not ^Scotland, ^and ^some ^laws ^differ ^up ^there. ^I ^don't ^think ^Dangerous ^Dogs ^is ^one ^of ^them, ^however.*

As stated by other posters, there may also be some civil liability from the bar's point of view, as they have a duty of care to their customers and if they knew about the dog, they could be liable. Again, not my area of expertise though.

If your mum or her colleagues have knowledge of the owner (name, address etc.) then it might be worth her contacting the police to add that to the report as he may not be known to the customer who was assaulted.

&gt; Myth 2: Monsanto will sue you for growing their patented GMOs if traces of those GMOs entered your fields through wind-blown pollen.

-- [NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/10/18/163034053/top-five-myths-of-genetically-modified-seeds-busted)

Here's a court case showing that Monsanto hasn't and doesn't ever intend to sue farmers for accidental cross-pollination:

&gt; Thus there is no evidence that defendants have commenced litigation against anyone standing in similar stead to plaintiffs. The suits against dissimilar defendants are insufficient on their own to satisfy the affirmative acts element, and, at best, are only minimal evidence of any objective threat of injury to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ alternative allegations that defendants have threatened, though not sued, inadvertent users of patented seed, are equally lame. These unsubstantiated claims do not carry significant weight, given that not one single plaintiff claims to have been so threatened.

To answer your second point, yes the left criticise Saudi Arabia. Their hypocrisy stems from the fact that they then refuse to criticise Islamism in Britain as practised by British Muslims. Not Saudi Muslims, British Muslims. 

The East London mosque has hosted Islamists such as Anwar al-Awlaki, Abdul Karim Hattin, and Delwar Hossain Sayeedi among others.
 
http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/East_London_Mosque 

Plenty of valid, legitimate sources in the footnotes of that webpage (the webpage itself is not my source.) 

Edit: Just to clarify my point about Islamists being funded by the government to preach in Mosques - it's no secret that mosques in Britain receive government funding. When Imams use that money to host Islamist scholars, that is effectively the government paying for Islamism to be preached in the UK.

&gt;Well I disagree. I think it has achieved something. It has made people realize that those extremists and so-called Muslim leaders aren't really representative of a lot of Muslims. It has made people realize that there are liberal Muslims.

Liberal Muslims are not mainstream Muslims and mainstream Muslims find them annoying at best, downright loathsome at worst. 

&gt;&gt;He's a Muslim but he's not a mainstream Muslim and the majority of Muslims (which you are trying to get on side) don't agree with his beliefs or his actions. To say it's only extremists that hate him is exactly what's wrong with this countries approach towards Muslims. The majority hate him.

&gt;If the majority hate him, then it shows the problem with the majority and further reveals why voices like his are needed.

A voice to do what? To try and change Islam rather than deal with extremism? What's the fucking point? 

&gt;&gt;The average everyday Muslim is defined by this government as extreme despite the fact they have no violent agenda, because they reject the reformist version of Islam that the government and Nawaz and Co promote. It's pointless and does nothing to tackle extremism, instead alienating the majority of Muslims in this country.

&gt;Well the views expressed my a significant number of Muslims are extreme. Most may not want to carry out violent acts that doesn't mean they don't support those violent acts. I think it does a lot to tackle extremism. What do you think should be done to tackle extremism?

This is just retarded. Non violent Muslims don't support violence. That's 99.9999% of them. 

&gt;&gt;He has no effect. He is chocolate teapot but instead of chocolate the teapot is made of shit and the tea bags are metaphorical teabags of the 12 year old gamer variety. 

&gt;This is an empty assertion you need more substance.

Sums you up nicely. 

&gt;&gt;Well when the government launches an anti extremism policy and every single Muslim organisation rejects it as islamaphobic and alienating, I'm assuming it's because those same organisations were not consulted. How about we start with them.

&gt;Which policy or policies are you referring to?

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33590305

&gt;&gt;You can sit and pontificate all day, defending the policies of Nawaz and Quillam, pretending there's a real plan to combat extremism, but it's crap. It's crap infested crap and nothing is done to actually combat extremism. At all. Ever.

&gt;Do you have a workable plan?

I've already said we need to stop alienating Muslims and work with the majority, mainstream and focus on tackling violent extremism. Not trying to change core Islamic beliefs which are never gonna be changed by the majority of Muslims.

It seems he has a set formula he follows according to the amount of minutes elapsed in the match. ~60mins first sub, ~75 second sub; and third sub will always be a striker in the 85th minute - it was Rickie last season, it was going to be Ings today if not for Couts. Furthermore, I do not understand why he doesn't use his last sub to throw on an extra defender after taking the lead at the end of the game. It wastes time, if not solidifying the defence!

Defence was pretty solid overall, was impressed with all the defenders. Mignolet was the only player I have a problem with, he took way to long to start our attack after catching the ball from a corner/cross. 

Our attack was still very stagnant and we hardly created a real threatening chance. Most good attacks came through Coutinho, I think molding the team around him and a Benteke partnership should be the long run goal. 

Benteke was good running in behind but there's only so much he can do when the majority of balls he challenged for were outside the box in the air. But he's getting into the right areas (and not like how Borini used to get into the right areas). 

Ibe looks pretty one dimensional, always looked to go on the outside and stick to his right foot. Lallana was poor, substituiting him was good and whatever formation we had with Can, Hendo and Milner in the middle (4-3-2-1 maybe) looked a lot better than the 4-2-3-1. 

Overall, tricky away game and I'll take 3 points. Fantastic by Coutinho who was trying to break their defence down all game (single-handedly it seemed).

However, in general, the Daleks are *far* further ahead. They have had time travel for most of the occasions that we have seen them in NuWho,a nd on many occasions in Classic Who, whereas the Cybermen have only occasionally been see to have access to that technology, and it doesn't seem that they've develeped that area themselves much or used it to rewrite their own history for example. The Daleks, on the other hand, appear to have extensively rewritten their own history to the point where they could successfully challenge the Time Lords even before the Last great Time War.

Looking the meeting of the two in *Doomsday*, we have Daleks who were survivors from that era, with the capacity to creat a void ship, which even the Doctor was impressed by encountering the Cybus cybermen who were really in their early days of development on Pete's World.

Even assuming that they had acquired various alien tech from alt-Torchwood, alt UNIT etc, they had barely got started, and we don't even know if they had conventional space travel, let alone hyperdrive or anything. The Daleks, by that point had had empires that had spanned galaxies, and had a history that stretched over millennia at least.

You have to think about the way that tech development is seen in the Whoniverse to put that in context. We have seen human development at all points of history and future history in the show, and it certainly seems that Humans have gone from tens of thousands of years of pre-history - the stone ages - through a rapid burst of technological increase - which we are undergoing now and seems to last for another few centuries - and then it looks to level off again, with things looking very similar for thousands, or even tens of thousands of years again. This fits the pattern of many sigmoid curves - the [logistic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#/media/File:Logistic-curve.svg) for example.

It seems likely that other species go through much the same pattern. The Time Lords went through a loooong time back, and the Daleks have re-engineered their history enough that they have pretty much done so too.

The Cybermen are still on the central, steep slope of that curve, but they will reach the top and start flattening out abgain very quickly - they are all about the *upgrade* after all. At that point, even through they may still be millennia behind the Daleks in strict chronological terms, they will still have 90% of the tech to compete with them.

- MvG isn't going to fill N'Zonzi's shoes and we're going struggle without him this season.

- Johnson is a bit meh. He didn't have a bad game but his crosses weren't the best and he missed a good oppurtunity.

- Our lack of depth in defence has already been tested and after 45 minutes of the new season we are already down to the bare bones. Presuming Pieters stays out we now have a CB playing at LB with nobody to cover him and our other two CBs have absolutely zero backup. So we're going be stuck with Wolly and Cameron at the back and that frightens me, even with Muniesa at CB our defence didn't look to be one unit. More than once there was poor communication between them and Butland and we ended up having to concede a corner or something.

- We need a big winger, Affelay didn't play bad but Moses was on another level compared to him. And Moses wasn't even THAT good. Hopefully this will be solved with Shaqiri.

Basically I feel we need sign a winger which it looks like we will, a centre mid to take N'Zonzi's role, a centre back possibly on loan and then maybe loan a left back too.

Our defense also seemed more solid. For Gods sake, even Lovren looked good.

Post match thoughts - positive. We need to learn how to play with Benteke. He was a bit wasted this game. We also seemed to struggle to put anything together in the final third.

On a positive note: I think we look a great deal more solid. Where we would normally lose the ball from errors, or have it go out for a corner or a throw, here we often retained possession, got the ball back into play. Being in control of the game is made easier when you can better control the ball and that looks like what we're adding to our game

Our defense also seemed more solid. For Gods sake, even Lovren looked good.

Overall, I guess I wanted to get retribution for our last game with Stoke, but it wasn't going to be likely on the opening game. And retribution aside, sometimes you get those games where you smash the opposition to smithereens, sometimes you get the games you have to grind out. This was the latter

Something does need to be done and there is more and more pressure on the bars and clubs to do it.

The night time economy isn't where it used to be with places closing down and not offering a good experience.  Young people and students (mostly) are are problematic to the city and themselves with how much they drink on a big night.  I'm sure its always been bad as far as people can remember, but it is worse now because of cheap drinks deals and promotions trying to compete with the supermarkets.  

Increasing the prices at the supermarkets shouldn't be the answer because it's reasonable to pay that much to drink at home. But something needs to be done about people getting smashed  before they head out so they don't have to spend as much money at venues with huge overheads, under a lot of pressure to create a safe environment and want to offer a good night out for customers. 

Customers still end up drinking and spending as much because of the crazy drinks deals set up to try and prevent pre-drinks. Then they are at a level of drunkness that is dangerous to the city, other people and themselves.

Door staff can only do so much in identifying through talk and observation how far gone to drunkness someone is.

This may not be the definitive answer, but again, i think it's somewhat a step in the right direction if it is used right.

The IRA and Hamas thing is a little tired now, he doesn't support them and simply advocated peace talks and diplomacy. Which worked with the IRA and may work with Hamas, what is happening now isn't working. I don't think we can continue to support clearly failed military intervention then criticise the one person who is advocating a different approach and has been on the right side of history many times (Nelson Mandela, gay rights, the IRA etc).

B) We won't agree on this point. Social media is not that bad of an indicator of how popular someone is with young people, it's clear at least that Corbyn is comfortably the most popular with the young out of all four candidates.

C) You're under the impression that people will buy austerity forever, a big issue was that Labour supported austerity, didn't offer an alternative and didn't challenge the myth that they caused the crash. People did mainly vote for austerity but most parties were offering it, what other choice did they have? The Conservatives have borrow more money then every Labour government combined whilst running an austerity program and nobody has spoken up about this, did you really think Labour having a leader that challenges austerity properly won't have some effect at least? 

D) Idealism brings about change as much as pragmatism. Things seen as pragmatism were idealism at one time. I see your point but in many areas such as housing and the environment, we can't keep being moderate and safe, someone has to take a stand and change the conversation we've been having for too long. I disagree so much about working with the electorate you have. The electorate changes, and you can never win people over to different ideas unless you argue for them. Following the media driven electorate forever is depressing and unnecessary. I agree Sanders won't win (he doesn't have the financial backing) but whichever Democrat wins will also win the presidency, all the republican candidates are simply too extreme and seen as a joke by large parts of America. 12 seats is pretty good if you can win them all back. Corbyn is putting left wing ideas into the mainstream as his views are getting mainstream attention, they also carry more weight as somebody from Labour is saying them. I don't think he would lose them votes - we don't know! We are just two guys with an opinion discussing on reddit, nobody knows what will happen. It's interesting that senior Tories like Kenneth Clark and Boris Johnson are actually worried about Corbyn and are taking him seriously. One thing is that centrist voters are more moral then we think, the Tories are realising this that's why they are giving little handouts such as the 'living wage', they know many soft c Conservatives and swing voters have a heart. I don't know why you think Corbyn isn't credible and what that means but fair enough. 

E) Agreed.

F) I don't think he would make them vote for things, he has suggested he would let MP's vote according to their conscience. I think I already said this but large amounts of the public already support some of the policies that he advocates, and you can't win people over to ideas unless you argue for them. The electorate is not fixed, it's always moving and will continue to move. The main reasons for the examples you cited are nationalism and anti-immigration. Germany is left of the UK in many ways. Fair enough about IDS, again though less certainty about what will happen if Corbyn wins - we're just giving opinions! I think disaster is a bit hyperbolic, people are creatures of habit and there won't be any major change whoever wins. I just think the direction will be better under Corbyn, that's just my personal view though. Ken had just served a term as London Mayor and Boris was personally very popular at the time, much more so then Ken Livingstone. I think that played a much larger role then anything else. 

I want to fix it too - so why do people keep advocating trying a similar approach to what lost Labour the election in 2010/2015? This isn't 1997, this isn't 1983, society is different now and what worked/didn't work then isn't applicable now. Whetever people say about 'Red Ed' Labour ran on a Centre Right manifesto - according to political compass (with small amounts of left wing policies to try to placate people) and lost. Partly because it didn't challenge myths about the economy, austerity and the 2008 crash, partly because people didn't think Ed Miliband was 'prime ministerial' enough, partly because of the rise of nationalism in Scotland and the UK, but also because people didn't see Labour as different enough to the Tories. Unless Labour makes a big change (and not a more right wing one) it will lose - the 2015 election proved this.

I've been out long enough to know how it goes, people don't want to hear about homophobia unless it's of the muslim persuatsion because it's not about homophobia, it's about muslims or whatever issue they're using homophiobia as a tool for, and people only listen to you as as gay person when you parrot what they want to hear, such as ""flamboyant gay guys annoy me as well"" or ""I think pride parade sucks also"" and will harshly condemn you when you don't parrot what they want to hear; they don't respect our opinions as gay people unless they match their own.

null,null,nssmuckers,num5-away,,null,"I think Walker was great at 1v1 defending until last season actually. He'd struggle against players like Mata who take up weird positions but he always dicked players who would take him on like Hazard. 

The most encouraging thing about his performance yesterday is how easily he slapped Ashley Young around whenever they'd go 1v1. Very much looked back to his best in that regard.

Still think his biggest weakness is his lack of variance in what he does with the ball. If he can get to the byline he has a good cutback but he can't cross from deep at all and isn't very good on the ball in tight spaces. The pass that Trippier played against Milan to Carroll is something that Walker couldn't dream of. 

It's a tough call...hopefully both Walker and Trippier get chances this season. Fullback is the rare position where I do think supreme athleticism can actually at times trump technique. Dani Alves is obviously much more gifted than Walker and especially in his advanced age he has has adapted his game, but around the Guardiola era his effectiveness was basically predicated on his absurd athleticism. A more technically gifted player without his pace and stamina would not have been as effective in that side IMO.

Cedric was probably a bag of nerves but after the first 20 he completely settled in and was great. Not only did he do decent defending (better than Targett) but he was a threat going forward and what a beauty ball that was for Pelle's goal. Same rating as Targett? No way. 

Big Vic I was too generous with, his passing wasn't there today but I still think he did great work defensively and didn't get taken off the ball (par for the course for him though I guess). That being said, he's not the passer that Schnieds was or Clasie is, I don't expect that out of him. I don't think he couldn't be arsed, I just think it's first match of the season, players are gonna take time to settle in. Was a fast paced game today, his passing isn't amazing all the time anyway, still would give him a good score though.

If the prescription topical your GP prescribed isn't working (how long have you been on it and how long is it suggested you wait before you see improvements?) go back to your GP. Id reccomend you request a derm referal, explaining the emotions and anxiety that you feel around your skin too as well as pointing out that the Dalacin T hasn't changed much if at all for your acne. 

I'm pretty sure Dalacin T is what I was prescribed in the past as well as oral anti biotics.  And  although figuring out a skin care regime that want overly harsh on my face has helped reduce the number of spots I have the hormonal acne I get aling my jaw and neck which leaves PIH still persists. I'm now seeing an NHS derm and using adapalene topically to fade the PIH and spironolactone orally to prevent testosterone from causing that acne in the first place. 

I tell you all this as I wish I had pushed for a derm referal when I was younger instead of going through years of adult acne wasting money on ineffective OTC products.  OTC stuff can be good and defo has its uses, but getting a proper assessment by a specialist will save you time and money in sorting out your skin. 

If you are experiencing any hyperpigmentation from your acne I'd defiantly reccomend including sunscreen in your daily routine as it will prevent those areas from getting darker from sun exposure. I'm pretty sure (someone correct me if I'm wrong) that if you're using glycolic acid it's photo sensitising in which case sunscreen should definitely be a part of your routine.

null,null,hello__monkey,null,null,null,"Hi as others have said you would need to sell to your son and he would need to then obtain mortgage in his own name. 

A few things worth mentioning, when you sell HMRC could check you've sold to him at a fair market rate. Therefore as its a buy to let and not your primary residence you could incur capital gains tax depending on current valuations for the area. If you sell at a lower than market price there's a risk of HMRC investigation.

Secondly you've said you have a buy to let property but on a residential mortgage. Mortgage Companies try to identify properties like this and force you to move to a buy to let mortgage (higher interest as higher risk).  Technically you are in breach of your residential mortgage terms.  Loads of people do it and not trying to scare you but worth knowing that there's a risk.  

He's also going to have to start keeping records / receipts for his self assessment tax returns as rental income need to be declared and taxed. But you will have been doing this anyway so should be easy for him to pick up.

null,null,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"My ratings for the game. 

Migs: 7.5. 

Did what was asked of him today. Made some good saves and generally his kicking was actually pretty good. 

Clyne: 7.5. 

Solid display. Kept the right side of the field completely shut down for Stoke. Defensively solid and supported Ibe nicely on attacks. Very refreshing to have a fullback who can defend. 

Skrtel: 6. 

Was not impressed with him today. He made a number of dodgy decisions and picked up a lazy yellow. 

Lovren: 7.5. 

Would potentially be higher if not for the elbow moment. He was having a solid game, and I don't think it was a red, but they've been given for things like that before and he needs to be more careful. Other than that he was very solid, much more so than Skrtel today.

Gomez: 7. 

It would be lower if he wasn't out of position, 18, and making his debut. He made a few errors, but overall did well, especially so given the circumstances listed above. Good performance.

Henderson: 6.5. 

Didn't come into the game at all until Can came on, not really his fault given the role doesn't play to his strengths, but Milner and Henderson clearly don't work in a double pivot. 

Milner: 6. 

For the same reasons as Henderson this low, his is slightly lower though as he lost the ball a fair amount. Like I said in Henderson's rating, I think he will benefit much more from being in a midfield 3. Highlight was poleaxing Adam. Almost worth upping his rating for that alone.

Ibe: 6.

 Didn't really offer much going forward, but managed to make a few positive runs.

Coutinho: 8. 

Was probably heading toward a 6.5 before his magic. He doesn't look fully fit, but was threatening glimpses of what he's about before unleashing that magical winner. He just needs to get a few more games, and he'll be back to being stellar. 

Lallana: 5. 

I'm a big fan of Lallana but he was poor. Shrugged off the ball numerous times, didn't offer anything going forward and generally made no impact on the game at all. 

Benteke: 6.5.

 Frustrating day for him. Until the introduction of Can allowing us to actually attack Stoke, he had no service other than balls lumped at him. In the final 20 minutes we started attempting to find him, but it needed to start happening far earlier. 

Subs: 

Can: 7. Opened up the game by letting Milner and Henderson off their chains. He looked tidy himself with some good tackles and passing. 

Firmino: 6.5. 

Looked promising. We didn't get enough time to really get to see him stretch his legs so his rating is low because of it.

Looked to really be up for the game, two crucial saves and in generally looked confident. I think this season he could step up and try to build a reputation as one of the league's best and the clean sheet will help towards the golden glove.

&gt;**Defense**

Whoscored agree with you, but I don't. The drama alarm went off a couple of times as Skrtel particularly panicked whilst trying to clear. Gomez ran a bit hot and cold, he was either fantastic or making a mistake, but was never boring. He looks like a great signing and a bit of experience will help him out.

&gt;**Midfield**

I agree with you but I think we started looking better immediately after half time. I think the change probably should have been made at half time so we could really kick on, but that leads us to...

&gt;**Lallana**

By a long way our least effective player today. His problem is that he's down the pecking order behind Coutinho and Firmino. He just isn't right for matches against physical teams like Stoke. Perhaps Bournemouth would have been the better start for him.

&gt;**Ibe**

He's still only 19. It's great that Rodgers has the faith to give him the game time. He's going to develop and hopefully become better than Sterling. And he looks like he's spent the entire summer in the gym so we should have him man-mark Sterling for the City games.

&gt;**Firmino**

Positive and energetic but obviously not on long enough to really make an impact.

&gt;**Benteke**

Like you say, average performance but acceptable given that little service. There were times I saw him stood still when we didn't have possession, and I kept thinking ""Balotelli would have gotten hate for that"" but I think that says more about the sub than it does about Benteke.

The actual facts about immigrants/asylum seekers are ignored because ""muh invasion"", people have been drummed up into such outrage it's just a way easier narrative to push than trying to make teenage girls sound like evil terrorists, rather than vulnerable teenagers groomed by a cult.

A new town would be a harder sell because it'd require substantial investments coming straight from the treasury to establish basic infrastructure, or a huge gamble from private developers.

However, in the few years I've lived here, I've seen it change quite radically. Buses have become more frequent, with additional routes and additional stops.
Most council buildings such as the library have been moved into modern contemporary buildings.

Also, last summer there was a home selling frenzy; you could walk down every street and I guarantee 90% of the houses would have for sale signs on them.
A year later, all of the houses have been renovated or are in the process, everything including rent has soared - and regular family gatherings have become a popular passtime around here. Mostly for the people who bought the houses without the intention of renting them (which seems to be in the majority.)

Suddenly people want to live in Fishponds as opposed to renting out their house. Everything in Fishponds feels more gentrified than it was 4 years ago. (Though it still holds a bad reputation, that reputation is definitely based on outdated data)

There's always something new being built in Fishponds every day now, and people are still flocking to it despite its heavy price.

I think (upper) fishponds is now a great place to live. I've accidentally fallen asleep with my door open a few times and had no concern about it whatsoever.

null,null,the_ultravixens,null,null,null,"When talking about the government deficit you need to realise that it does not exist in a vacuum, and that there are two other major sectors that you need to be thinking about when talking about deficits.  These two sectors are the private sector and the foreign sector.  Together the way that their different balances interact is governed by the [sectoral balances equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectoral_balances), which is given by:

(S – I) = (G – T) + (X – M)

The sectoral balances equation says that total private savings (S) minus private investment (I) has to equal the public deficit (spending, G minus taxes, T) plus net exports (exports (X) minus imports (M)), where net exports represent the net savings of non-residents.  This relationship is true by accounting definition, and is not negotiable.

So before you start banging on about the government deficit, you also need to think ""what was the private sector doing and what was the foreign sector doing"".

Here's a [sectoral balances chart for the UK](http://www.3spoken.co.uk/2015/06/uk-sectoral-balances-q1-2015.html).  What does it tell us?  Well, in the UK we have a deeply entrenched trade deficit, implying that the domestic sector must run a deficit and the foreign sector is running a surplus, and draining the UK of financial assets.  In the run up to the crisis the private sector was also running a surplus.  This means that the private sector was net saving, by accumulating government bonds.  The *only* way this situation is possible is for the government to run a deficit.  Since the government is currency issuer, and can theoretically issue unlimited debt (with the caveat being that they have to watch inflation), this situation is not a problem and is sustainable within sensible interest and inflation parameters. 

If you want to cut the government deficit, one of two things have to happen.  Either you have to cut the trade deficit, which in practice means many fewer imports and a lower standard of living, or the private sector has to run a deficit, which in practice means the private sector needs to run up debt.  Since, unlike the government, the private sector is not a currency issuer, it has limited capacity to do so, before you enter a massive deleveraging cycle, which is what the last decade has been.

Furthermore, referring back to the sectoral balances chart, you will notice that after the crisis there is a *massive* spike in the household surplus.  this is why we ran the huge deficit.  It's because the private sector wanted to start net saving, and accumulating financial assets in order to pay off debts and repair balance sheets.  It's important to realise that the government is *not* in full control of the deficit, as it is also subject to the whims of the private and foreign sectors.  However by running a large deficit the government can allow the private sector to repair balance sheets and eventually return to financial health.

Unfortunately the current political and media dialogue completely misses all this, and focuses only on the government deficit and is probably going to lead to suboptimal policy.  the private sector is still massively indebted, and I think that current deficit reduction policy is likely to mean that our deleveraging cycle turns out rather like the one Japan has been going through for the last two decades.",null,0,null,1439146365,null,null,false,0,ctx41k9,null,t3_3gcokv,null,null,null,t1_ctwxtzm,null,null,null,1440378260,null,18,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

null,null,fuckin442m8,null,null,null,"&gt;They know that millions of innocent Muslims in Britain suffer from Islamophobia and prejudice, so they champion the cause of Muslims. And then, when it turns out that a sizeable amount of Muslims are very, very hostile to Jews, feminists, LGBT people etc, they don't know what to do.

Maybe if they don't understand that different people have different views and you can treat them differently.

People champion the cause of peaceful muslims who aren't bigots, and don't champion the cause of non peaceful / hateful muslims. 





&gt;They don't want to criticise Muslims and feel like they are further demonising a minority that is already persecuted so they look the other way and pretend it isn't happening.

No, stop this talking in absolutes. There is no single entity called ""muslims"", not all 1.5 billion muslims have the same views on jews, feminists, LGBT people, anymore than all Christians have the same views. ""The left"" again - a single entity, criticise all bigotry often.




&gt;The thing is that there are millions of Muslims who want to challenge radical Islam, who want to reform it and bring it into the 21st century. And the British left, the very people who should be aligned with them - who should be championing women's rights and LGBT rights and freedom of speech and freedom of debate - are dead against them. 

What complete and utter bollocks. I cannot believe the stuff being upvoted in here.







&gt;Nearly every time there is a choice between radical Islam and reforming forces, papers like The Guardian choose to support the former.


There it is again, ""the guardian"" - that's the entire basis of this deluded thread, people want to simplify the world into The Guardian - represents the entire left, Nawaz - represents the entire non-bigoted non-extremist muslim community, &amp; Choudary represents all the other muslims.

Do well, deliver a good product to your costumers, be passionate and interested in improving. You get promoted. You get a raise and you also get happy costumers that sends praising words to your boss.

I'm not against paying tip, as I recently went to Australia and paid a taxi driver $40 AUS in tip. As he gave me the best service I've ever had, but driving back to me from across town to deliver my lost wallet. He asked me for less than it would've gotten him from a customer, I gave him a lot of tip. We also tipped him about 20% after the original ride, because he was just overall one of the best taxi drivers I've had. Telling stories, cracking jokes etc...

Now, if you suck at your job, have negative body language, no form of expected service or any sort of passion about delivering a good product to the costumer, then why the hell would I want to pay him/her tip?
