But because countries are only wealthy in general and often include areas of much larger deprivation sometimes net contributors benefit from those kinds of programmes. It's embarrassing really that there are even areas so deprived in Britain that the EU has even needed to designate some of them as convergence zones.

Dude are you me?
Living alone sounds awful, like even when I don't see people for days it's at least comforting knowing there's people in the house. 

Pets are rad, I have allergies and illness means upkeep can be tricky (and I imagine that could be a problem for /u/stufstuf if you're busy with a job/study or whatever) but there's different types that can fit different owners! My hedgehog died like a month ago and it really makes you realise how helpful animal friends are.

I remember being confused that being alone could make me *more* self conscious but somehow it's the case. And I think it's annoying since when I finally get out I can just be worrying about my skin. This seems like a really sweet supportive community who'd be cool if people need to talk. Sending love~

The BoE won't give all this money back to the government at once but it is still owned by us &amp; will eventually end up going back to the government (they'll use the money to buy more government bonds but also pay some back to the treasury if this is deemed sensible for the economy). The consequence of this is that the BoE (again, owned by us) owns over 26% of UK gilts (government bonds).

You most likely have experience in high pressure situations, time constraints etc. Team working is also an important aspect of hospitality as is a strong work ethic. There's obviously a lot more I'm missing but this can give you some idea of the kind of skills you could of accrued and things you can highlight to future employers.

In terms of direction, think outside of work, aim for something you're passionate/interested in and find the paths to achieve a position in the industry. Sorry if none of this is of any help! Just trying to help and hope you find something rewarding :)

Sort of let my thoughts run a bit early in the morning - don't take this as an argumentative post or anything, I'm just opining on my general observations on what you were saying and my feelings about Putin, politics and the Morning Star.

That's fair enough on the EU stuff, I mean I don't agree with it but its just opinion about it and stuff etc.

&gt;  As for foreign policy I'm highly critical of the west and not a fan of the dictators either, but I am not a typical lets hate on Putin for breathing redditor, I like him for one reason and that's because he stifles some of the wests attempts to go being imperialists.

Putin *is* authoritarian and he *is* an imperialist, more so than the majority of the various Western leaders his foreign policy has become shifted against. There's been mistakes in EU/Western foreign policy with regards to Russia, particularly an over-enthusiastic expansion of NATO - but Putin's government has intentionally sabotaged its relationship with the West when it has deemed it in the strategic interest of his oligarchical state to do so, when on certain issues before it had been more than happy to accept Western actions that the far left would criticise.

There's a tendency among the far left in the West to look at Russia Today or something and take the Russian governments propaganda and their view of their role in the world at face value because it justifies their own view of their own side of the world (the West), and its been the same since the days of the USSR really. Russia has shown more obvious support for Palestine for longer and when people see that they're impressed - but then it sort of brushes over the fact that Putin supports brutal regimes that are otherwise isolated, as well as ones that the West has also been guilty of being too kind on, but he is not subject to the same pressure to withdraw from such ventures.  It rings kind of hollow that he's supposedly countering Western imperialism in Palestine (or what he calls Western imperialism when there is a growing divide between Israel and the West) when just a few miles away in Syria he helped Assad crush moderate resistance against his government from day one.

Sadly, the Morning Star is guilty of exactly the same thing and that is why it has backed up people who should be abhorred by most leftists. Unless I've misread something and Milosevic was a straight up guy and the Big Bad West was protecting...jihadists?

So while I understand *why* you might like Putin, I'd suggest you think carefully about what he really represents. He isn't an antidote to Western imperialism. He's an imperialist himself - and whatever mistakes the West have made, he doesn't check Western interests to stop them being imperialist, he does it because he has no respect for anybody who lacks any strength.

&gt; Honestly, the typical Brit voter doesn't even know what left wing means anymore and are being pushed towards UKIP's vileness because it's the only alternative to the mainstream they know.

I agree to an extent, but I think that the problem is there that it is a misunderstanding to believe that the reason people are going to UKIP is because there is no left wing alternative or none of them are left wing anymore. UKIP have attracted people who used to vote Labour, many of them - socially conservative, economically left wing traditional Labour voters who have switched to UKIP out of disillusionment, predominantly from the white working class in the coastal south east and east of England, and even in the north. However they're being pushed to UKIP because they are in poor economic conditions or perceive themselves to lack opportunity, and in a lot of the areas where UKIP have real support, UKIP offer them an alternative and a solution to what they think causes their problems, the EU and immigration being the two prime things. They're wrong of course, but what counts in the end is what the electorate thinks.

And this is the other problem - there IS other further left alternatives including the Greens who you support. However the simple truth is the Green Party do not broadly appeal to the working class as a whole. The Green party or other further left parties don't appeal to the small c conservative segment of the working class and they never will. The Green Party might have shifted left recently but they'll only become electorally relevant if they return to the centre-left and try to replace the Lib Dems. 

&gt; Ideologically I like anarcho-communism the best, it's a difficult thing to reach so I throw in pragmatism hence why im voting green this year, but the mainstream papers are way way further from my views than the morning star.

Then it makes sense that you read it - though of course ideally we should all aspire to try and read a lot of material on politics that doesn't always just conform to our viewpoint. The problem with the Morning Star that it is *so* biased on certain issues and less professional than any broadsheet that a lot of the time its just going to be feeding you confirmation bias and not always the truth. I mean christ, I popped on to it just now on the search term ""Russia"" out of curiosity to see what its come up with recently, and there was a headline suggesting NATO advisors had been deployed to Ukraine to help crush ""anti-fascists"". This is basically the strongest possible form of spin; it completely lacks subtlety and is not sourced reliably. Its the far left equivalent of the Daily Express calling the recent Russian bomber activity in the North Sea an act of war or something.

&gt; Oh and an extra point, there was some news about Castro a while back and the morning star told the news then gave background, whilst the metro gave the news and asked why he wasnt dead yet...

The Metro is a rag, what do you expect? You can probably find more sophisticated and accurate coverage of Casto in a more mainstream broadsheet or other news source than either the Metro or the MS. This is an assumption on my part I admit as I've not seen any MS material on Casto recently, but given their track record, I fear their portrayal of him won't be too nuanced. I'm sure their coverage of the positive aspects of his rule in Cuba are well covered as are his contributions to environmentalism and resistance to American interference, and that's great. However, are they as critical as one would hope about the numerous human rights abuses of his totalitarian rule, the exile of hordes of Cubans, his participation in aggressive Soviet imperialist battles with the US or even by itself in Africa and elimination of any sign of political opposition? I don't know, but I'm not confident on that. If you could link the article in question I'd love to see for myself.

Fun side story, former MS contributor George Galloway wrote a book on Castro which I had to handle in a charity shop once while volunteering there. Just an unrelated fact that popped into my head. As a student of history it was fairly easy to see early on what tosh it was. It had to be binned (or ""ragged"" as they call it) anyway as the spine was buggered, but I'm not sure it was a huge loss to the world. 

I also destroyed a book by David Irving. Sue me!

EDIT - By the way, I don't know if you are but I've made it a habit ever since I started doing campaigning of saying to every very left of centre person I meet...please, *please* don't be one of those super condescending people who says there is no such thing as a working class conservative. Unless my nan was a fictional entity I imagined, this is false.

Although it does provide standards, make trade and movement of livestock easier and champions sustainability issues only a very small amount of the UK economy these days is based on agriculture, not even 1%. Compare that to net gainers like Romania which has something daft like 8% or France which is the agricultural powerhouse of the EU.

it's probably the area of the EU which is undergoing and still needs big reforms. It's slow progress.

The CFP *has* undergone reform recently which led to the scrapping of the well-intentioned but ultimately stupid 'quotas' system (where excess fish had to be dumped over board). Fishermen like to complain but I think they recognise that tough laws on sustainability is a better long-term solution for their job security. The main issue is more tied in with something called the Factortame case in the 90s where a British sovreign law which basically meant Spanish boats couldn't fish in waters surrounding the UK was directly repealed by the EU for the first time. So to this day Spanish boats still have a right to fish the North Sea surrounding Britain (though amusingly it was seemingly ok for us to do it through the 20th century to Iceland leading to the Cod Wars. They aren't even in the EU for goodness sake).",null,0,null,1430447043,null,0,false,0,cqulnmv,null,t3_34edl1,null,t1_cqulnmv,null,t1_cqudu7s,null,null,null,1432705695,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

As for the morning star talk about anti-fascists I feel they're right to do so as a counter balance to the BBC etc who completely ignore them. Take the Azov battalion as the most popular for displaying Nazi insignia, every one of them wheres a badge with a nazi related symbolism on it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion to deny there are fascists in Ukraine is insane and dangerous. 

The conservative working class do exist, I prefer to call them reactionary, typically under educated, my grandad for instance has never read a book in his life according to him and spouts the stuff the mainstream news says apart from things like gay marriage which he's against... I've tried saying to him before how does gay marriage affect you and he said it doesn't and I said well then, but he still parrots the whole man and woman line. He's also in favour of the death penalty and also says things like ""Don't let them back into the country"" when talking about jihadis, I'm hesitant to say the latter in case any impressionable kids went and realised they made a mistake and I'm very against the death penalty just because it's not as quick and painless as people make it out to be. Going back to the marriage thing, I'm personally against all marriage and I find atheist who get married 'in the eyes of god' to be highly hypocritical. Later when I read anarchist material the whole 'marriage is just confirming a partnership to the state (being an oppressive entity)' resonated with me.

Also I'd urge if you would please stop saying 'far left' because I consider myself left to far left but on the libertarian end of the scale and not the authoritarian.

If the west wanted a war with a country, say Iran which was and is still possible, I'd be against it, I wrote my MP on the issue which he basically just glossed over with drivel in a reply. It's for the people of Iran to remove their government ideally, the West has a history (libya &amp; syria) of getting involved in countries and causing havoc in the region. You mentioned milosevic in your response, one of the latest things I'd read was that Kosovars were heading to Germany in droves for some reason which I can't remember.

I've been an RT regular view for years now and can point out their rubbish and that of the western press quite easily, lately I've been reading anarchist stuff (50th time I've said this) http://anarchistnews.org/ is a good site. Essentially the more you read the better, unfortunately the majority of the working people do not have time to read and if they were going to be reading papers and news sites I'd prefer they were exposed to anti-war sentiment in the morning star than fearmongering from the daily mail (I'm trying to get family and extended family to stop reading this rubbish). The centrist parties are pushing the whole should we give more benefits or less benefits so workers feel the benefit, if you ask someone ""What about if the workers control the means of production so they earn more instead of one person giving the profits to himself, that way we can tax people to support the unemployed and you won't be skint."" and then they look at you with glazed eyes as though you are talking foreign, the mainstream press or politicians don't ever put this line across because it isn't in their interests. Imagine if we had a citizens income as the greens are proposing as a future goal, we could have people who could just give up their jobs to further their own education (doesn't have to be through university, I've learned more outside of the system), we'd get rid of racism, and other discriminatory tendencies and transcend this back and forth system we're in now between centrist capitalist parties.",null,0,null,1430447205,null,0,false,0,cqulr6u,null,t3_34bjt2,null,t1_cqulr6u,null,t1_cquk36c,null,null,null,1432705741,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Second, money printing forces up the yield on bonds. Increased bond yields means domestic interest rates rise. Increased interest rates means falling house prices. If house prices fall banks must raise capital. To raise capital banks must stop lending. If banks stop lending we get a massive deflationary spiral. This would be good for the overall economy in the long term, but it would also mean government revenues fall. When revenues fall the government will need to cut more or borrow more.

Overall it's a good idea for the government to balance the books.

The reason I say this is that following the result at Man City where we came back brilliantly only to lose out late again is going to hurt confidence defensively. That combined with the title race being over the top teams may not be up for it. This could mean relegation threatened teams may sneak some points. i.e Hull vs Liverpool where had Liverpool been closer to forth I believe they would have fought more. 
I know we have Everton and West Ham two mid table certainties but these are two teams whose managers jobs are not 100% certain so have a point to prove. I only hope Burnley will not need the points on virtue of being relegated cos we may need a result. 

On a related topic I think that although I still see him as are number 1 following his howler at city Guzan's confidence will have been undoubtedly shaken. This of course could feed down to his defence. So perhaps Sherwood should switch keepers for the last few games in order to inspire some FA Cup magic. 

All I can say is we have a nasty habit of dropping points at crucial moments (possibly 1 at city and 2 at QPR) and we do not have enough of a cushion this time to afford to do that.

Many people volunteer to gain experience in the field before they enter it. I am sure some hospitals or nursing homes could use a volunteer where you are able to see that future world in some way.
As for GCSE's the broad English, science and Maths is what most jobs want, if you want a specific career some might need specific A-levels or a degree. With A-levels 4 is normal and a ""full time job"", while younger people take up to 11 or 12 GCSEs simultaneously, whilst at school. It depends how much free time you are willing to sacrifice and money to shell out for the courses. Physiotherapy requires a degree as far as I am informed.
If you truly wish to do wish to do something new you will find a way to motivate yourself to study anything. There will be homework and the like if you study at college, though you are crossing it yourself, as an adult, so don't expect to be chased like a little baby and helped like you were little in school. You might be able to join a college full time and just study there as others do, as you have equivalents of GCSE.

null,false,collinsl02,null,null,null,"Right, here goes a long response that I posted elsewhere earlier this week:

Firstly, we aren't directly electing the Prime Minister. The system is that we elect a Member of Parliament to represent our local area (called a constituency). This can be a large constituency in a rural area (Ross, Skye and Lochaber) or a small densely populated one (Islington North). Each candidate for a constituency can be a member of a political party, or they can be an independent candidate. 

In our system of first past the post voting (which a lot of people think is broken but there you go) the candidate with the most votes gets the seat in the House of Commons. The FPTP system means that a candidate with a low number of overall votes can still win - for example in the 2005 election the Labour party took 57% of the seats, with only 36% of the vote.

Once the votes have been counted and we know which MPs have which seats (and which parties the MPs belong to) we can work out which party overall has the majority of seats in the house of Commons (I'll come onto the House of Lords later). The party with the majority of seats (I.E. one party with over 50%) is asked by Her Majesty the Queen to form a Government. These days the Queen has no choice in who she asks because we have a constitutional Monarchy, but it's officially Her Government.

The leader of the party with a majority takes the Prime Minister's job - they are essentially in charge of the country, but they don't have a separate branch of government that they control like the President and the Executive Branch in the USA.

In cases (such as the last parliament and most likely this one) where an absolute majority has not been reached, parties may form coalitions in order to gain the most seats overall - the coalition of two or more parties can be used to count towards the majority. 

In cases where no coalition has been formed and no majority is present the largest minority party may still be asked to form a government however the system quickly becomes unworkable because there would be too much conflict and discussion on the legislation being tabled (in the UK tabling a motion means discussing it, unlike in the US where it means shelving it and not proceeding with it) and not enough aye votes would be passed to move legislation on in a timely manner.

When a majority government is not formed the procedure would likely be to have another general election as soon as possible, to hope that a majority government can be formed out of that one. Although she has never used this power before, the Queen could theoretically refuse to ask any minority party to form a government, triggering another general election without a government being formed, but if this happens it may cause a constitutional crisis which is a Bad Thing.

The other chamber in the Houses of Parliament is the House of Lords. The members of this chamber are men and women who have been given peerages by the Queen (on the orders of the government though) which entitle them to sit in the Lords. These people can be anything from prominent industrialists (Lord Sugar) to ex-senior politicians (Lord Prescott) etc. Because the Lords hold their seats for life (in theory, they may be removed if they are involved in a major scandal and have their peerages removed) they are supposed to be the ""long term view"" of the country. Because they are not elected they have no powers to block legislation permanently, all they can do is vote to pass a piece of legislation or return it to the House of Commons for another vote. A 2/3rds majority is then needed in the House of Commons to pass the returned legislation without the further involvement of the Lords - they therefore act as a checking system to make sure that controversial legislation has been thoroughly debated and is agreed upon by the vast majority of MPs.

The three currently largest parties in the government just gone (I'm saying this in this way because officially the last government has been dissolved by the Queen (on a schedule of every 5 years which was set by the last government rather than the government choosing when to call an election - the Queen has no say in when it gets dissolved) and we don't yet know which parties will be the largest in the next government as the election hasn't yet happened) were the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, and the Liberal Democrats.

The Conservative party and the Labour party have been the largest two parties since the 1920s when Labour overtook the Liberal (as it then was) party. The leader of the Conservative Party is David Cameron, and the leader of the Labour Party is currently Ed Milliband. Tony Blair was the leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007, and was Prime Minister from 1997 until 2007. The Liberal Democrat's leader is Nick Clegg, who served as the Deputy Prime Minister in the last government as the government was formed of a coalition of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats.

In the British system the second largest party (traditionally either the Conservatives or Labour) is referred to as the ""opposition"" and the leader of that party is the ""leader of the opposition"" - this essentially means that the opposition party forms a ""shadow cabinet"" which will draft policy and will watch as much as they can of what their counterparts in the actual cabinet are doing. The leader of the opposition also has a chance to have an ""exchange of views"" with the Prime Minister once a week at ""[Prime Minister's Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF8pM4wiLaY)"" - a weekly even where MPs can ask the PM about various issues that affect their constituency or general policy questions. These events are televised and there are loads on youtube as they can be quite fun at times, especially when you get two good leaders going head to head.

Political outlook wise, the Conservative party can be described as slightly right of (our) centre, and the Labour party can be described as slightly left of centre. Bear in mind though that our centre is well to the left of the US centre.

Views wise, right now the main focus of the major parties is the economy and it's continued recovery. Labour wish to improve the economy by making slight cuts in expenditure and by borrowing some money to work on stimulating the economy, whereas the Conservatives wish to make much deeper cuts and borrow no money at all whilst spending money to work on stimulating the economy. And as usual both sides accuse the other of messing up the economy, the Conservatives keep going on about how Labour left them a complete mess to clear up and Labour keep saying the Conservatives are cutting everything back too far. 

The other differences come in things like membership of the EU - the Conservatives have promised to have a referendum (national vote) on whether we stay in the EU or whether we leave it. Labour have said they will not have such a referendum, but both sides agree that our position in the EU needs to be renegotiated.

The other major difference is taxes - there are some differences in how the parties want to deal with the tax rate, with Labour accusing the Conservatives of giving tax breaks to their rich mates (the Conservative party is seen as more upper class whereas Labour was formed by and is still largely controlled by trade unions) whilst the Conservative view is that Labour is making the richest few pay more than their fair share.

The most major minor issue is immigration - both Labour and the Conservatives are committed to cutting the number of immigrants this country gets from outside the EU (we can't restrict intra-EU movement) but both sides are accusing the other of not meeting the targets they set when they were both in power.

Balo has no fucking desire. He thinks he's made it because everyone's been telling him that for years. He's talented but not a good player. He doesn't work hard.

In case you weren't around at the time, New Labour pledged to not raise income tax and follow the Tory spending plans, this is why the debt decreased until 2001.  I don't consider this to be an arbitrary time scale, because it was this point that Brown proclaimed he'd abolished boom and bust, he stated this.  Since then we had an increase in spending above the increase in GDP, that isn't going to be sustainable indefinitely.  As history showed, it wasn't considered to be just 8 years later.

&gt; The IMF has at various points

The IMF isn't just one voice, also, I'm reminded of that Churchill quote, if you have two economists in a room you will get two differing opinions, three if one of the economists is Keynes.  But back in 2010, they were in favour.

The indie link can be completely discarded as the source is the politically biased offshoot of the LSE, which was founded by Fabians however, the wording is also key, most people think that reducing spending will result in a contraction, the argument is if it's for a good end goal.

Now the links are:

* Simon Wren Lewis
* Krugman
* NEF
* Richard Portes
* Simon Wren-Lewis
* Krugman

All of course, written in hindsight.

So let's be honest, most of those links are duplicating the same argument, made with the benefit of hindsight.  Let's go back to 2009 when /u/TheAnimus was working for a hedge fund and had much better hair, having to spend a weekend updating some shock simulations to the mostly eqd portfolio.  It was not a pretty picture, most models hadn't taken into account correlated risk, and for good reason, it's NP-Hard, so the liquidity crisis is really in full swing, it's hard to know if you can trust anyone.  It's often been said if the USA sneezes, we all catch a cold, well suddenly we're looking at the eurozone doing the same.  The PIGS were a very big worry, what happens if the project collapses?  Our trading partners were looking less and less.  It was the kind of stuff that made me think I should stock up on tinned food and get a shotgun license.  I settled for inflation bonds instead.

What a lot of these people are doing, as I've said before is using the benefit of hindsight to ignore certain actions that people were keen to protect themselves against.  Ratings agencies were under fire for not doing their job, go back in time a decade and ask 10 economists or 10 rates traders what would have happened if the UK was to be downgraded?  You might get one that said nothing, people will ignore them, but probably not.  The fact is a lot of things happened which defied conventional macroeconomic theory and wisdom of the markets.

One thing that was apparent was the initial reaction was too strong, so the plan was changed.  No one was sure what Labour would have done any differently at this point too.  Also I dare say a lot of the gdp reduction was not really due to government spending reduced, but also the wider economic conditions.  It certainly was a text book time for some Keynesian stimulus, but again, the fear of borrowing money prevailed.  It's far too tempting to look back and say, that fear was unfounded, I've not ever needed my car insurance, does that mean I'm an idiot to have spend Â£5k on it?  I mean I'm a really good driver, I've got the accolades to prove it, I'm not like those other drivers that crash, my track record demonstrates this.

So this is why I don't claim to have any complete answers, the system is far too complex to accurately know the solution and I'm highly suspicious of those who claim too after all *the problem with socialists is eventually they run out of other peoples money*.  I personally think these systems are too n-order to be able to apply such simplistic models to them, even if that used to be my job, one that I was better than average at, I don't believe they are correct, just some are useful.  Too many people round here allow idealism to trump such pesky implementation details.

What I think is fairer in this respect is to actually look at what people were saying back in 2010, there was tremendous pressure for a reduction in government spending, hence the note.   All your links are written with hindsight, and not respective of the thought at the time.

So when it comes to that, did most people think there was no money left, absolutely, the deficit and the wider economic situation, few voices disagreed.",null,0,null,1430464409,null,0,false,0,cquswlo,null,t3_34flqt,null,t1_cquswlo,null,t1_cqudxmu,null,null,null,1432709111,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

The advantage of doing this course is that everyone will be in the same boat and the tutors can help you get back into the swing of learning.

Once you've done this you can decide if you want to pursue a degree in physiotherapy or do something else. But your college/tutors will be on hand to help you with that decision.

You can find courses here:

http://www.accesstohe.ac.uk/Pages/Default.aspx

If it is physiotherapy you're interested in doing then you should find some degree courses at unis nearby or distance learning options (I assume you don't want to move) and call them to find out their entry requirements and work towards that.

Also I found this thread on student room about mature students getting into physiotherapy which you might find helpful:

null,false,Melberger,null,null,null,"Love from the reaction from the Spurs sub.

- Southampton is the club among that list that I haven't visited as an away fan. Can't really comment.

- Spurs are alright. I went through a period of disliking them, but that was at the height of our failures at WHL, and seeing us get smashed 3-0 under Hughes a week before Christmas in the freeeeezing fucking cold on a Wednesday night for example. Also something to be said for the fact that they were direct rivals to us for CL qualification for a while, and the atmospheres could be a bit hostile. They have that kind of cockney brashness to them, which makes them hard to like, but I've met a few sound ones, and I don't really have anything bad to say about them.

- Liverpool, indifference really. I don't mind them in truth, always love seeing them get one over on the rags. After last season's game in the title run in, I left Anfield properly down in the dumps, gutted, thought the title had gone, and one Liverpool fan was walking in the opposite direction to me and must've recognised the sollum look on my face (and the sky blue shirt) and offered his hand out as we passed, which I accepted. But then you have walking away from the ground minutes earlier crammed in with a load of Liverpool fans walking down Anfield road, and having to suffer chorus after chorus of 'we're goiiin te win de league' from day trippers in the broadest Irish accents you'll hear outside of Father Ted, and the accounts I've heard of other blues coaches being bricked, so it's a mixed bag.

- Arsenal. Reallllly mixed bag. I can't help but get the impression that many, or even most, of their fans have a sanctimony gene rivalled only by the rags. They also seem to have a massive sense of entitlement, and the bitterness towards us has been palpable since the takeover (somewhat warranted, granted, but the bile has often been quite extraordinary). I get the impression that most of their fans are extremely upset that we rocked the Applecart so much post takeover. ""Who's this jumped up little upstart"" kinda thing. And they have been very bitter towards us since we nabbed the French lesbian from them. Besides the rags, they're the club I'm inclined to dislike the most. They're prone to holding a grudge, and seem incredibly fickle at times. They majorly got their knickers in a twist after *that* Adebayor game, saw one Arsenal fan lash out at a pissed up blue and leave him on the deck after the game. I'm inclined to really dislike them, and if you pushed me I'd say that I did. However, all the Arsenal fans I've actually met and spoke to around the Emirates on a match day have been totally sound, to a man. So it's a bit conflicted.

- Not too fussed about Chelsea. The Bridge is an increasingly cosseted and sterile ground, filled with middle class Londoners and a lot of plastics. It's where I fear we're going due to our increasing ticket prices, so I sympathise with the older Chelsea fans who've been squeezed out. Can't say I like them, never really spoke to a proper Chelsea fan who wasn't a plastic, my only real encounter with one was some halfwit who stumbled out of a pub on my way back to the tube after the game, he was decked out in Stone Island gear as were a couple of his bonehead bum chums, he looked like he was Danny Dyer body double, he proceeded to offer me out as we walked down the street after hearing my accent. That was the caricature Chelsea nobhead. And there's a few of them if you dig through the plastics, by all accounts.

- The rags, where do you start? The most sanctimonious and holier than thou clowns in the entire football league. Only need to look at that link to see evidence of it. The club that became what it is today thanks to the Munich air disaster, milked it for all it was worth and evicted the widows of the dead players from their homes once the media spotlight had moved on. The supporters who were born decades later who make aeroplane gestures towards City fans in derbies in order to gain a response and then feign outrage. The supporters that were disappointed we didn't interrupt the minutes silence at the Munich memorial game. The supporters that are hyper sensitive about anything but grovelling sympathy re Munich, who regularly sing about Hillsborough every time they play Liverpool. The same supporters that unfurled a banner with 'Istanbul reds' emblazoned on it after Leeds fans were murdered by Galatasaray fans in Istanbul. The same supporters that mocked the death of Marc Vivien Foe, apparently justified because some of our fans sing about Munich. The fanbase which draws the most shallow and needy gloryhunting plastics from every corner of the globe, who all apparently have family in Manchester. The same plastics that took as much pleasure ridiculing us when we were in League One as they did winning the treble the same year. The same plastics that now ask us where we were when we were shit. The club which made the PL the financially skewed corporate monster it is today, and road that gravy train to a strong monopoly at the top of it, only to bleat and cry about 'the United way' and 'City ruining football' after we were taken over by a wealthy owner and took it to its logical conclusion. The club with the single most entitled fanbase in world football. The club with supporters who call themselves 'cockney reds', and will happily call Mancunian blues 'dirty Manc scum' despite supporting a (Greater) Manchester club. Those same clowns punching/spitting/kicking lone City fans on Wembley Way in groups after being particularly bitter and salty about a loss in an FA Cup semi. The club who's longest serving and most esteemed player was actually poached from our academy, and is nonetheless more renowned for shagging his brother's missus over a period of years - the other one was a wife beating alcoholic. The chuckle brothers. The official club noodle sponsors.

I really like the Lib Dem activists tbh, they arent tribal like some Labour supporters, the Labour voter I spoke to last night told me that hed vote Labour if they put a donkey up,I told him they had in his ward and he was still resolute. Lib dems are far less irrational.

He's done much better since then to push his parries away from dangerous areas, out wide or noticing where players are running in and pushing it elsewhere. definitely saw an improvement from the kid with these situations. 

I'd like for him to try to hold onto shots a bit better, but you can already see he is improving. Hopefully work put in by cech and the keeper trainer continue to develop Tibs. 

I see a lot of praise for him but after cech I'm going to be a harsh critic. He's good but he has the potential to be better. Difference between a great player and one of the greatest. Hope he never falls back on his height and loan success. He has the ability to
Challenge for best Keeper in the PL, then eventually go after best gk in the world right now. 

As it stands I'd rank de gea as more of a presence and game saver. Easily deserved the gk spot ahead of Curtois in the pl XI. Id like Tibs to get more of the small things taken care of, and become inarguably the best in our league. 

He's just not there yet and I Remember  being disappointed he couldn't preserve the win. For Normal gk standards it was a good first save, but we are going to hold him to the highest standards. 

Needs to work on his footwork, holding onto the ball more often and not giving up rebounds, and definitely distribution (which has been notable to most fans.)

The best thing would be to figure out what you want to do, and choose GCSEs based on that. But if that's still a bit far away, taking all three of those courses would be a great start. With those, plus your HAVO, I reckon you'd be ready to move on to A-levels. 

2) I wouldn't drop English, *especially* if your English is good. That just means it's an easy GCSE for you to obtain. In general it's useful to have English, Maths and Science GCSEs. The ""Human Health and Physiology"" course you mentioned seems to come under the science bracket. 

3) It should be more than possible for you to study 3 GCSEs at once - no need to put English off for a year. Of course this all depends on your schedule and work ethic, but I think it's possible. 

4) GCSEs are not that difficult. It sounds like your study skills are a bit rusty, but they will develop with time. You absolutely, 100% without a shadow of a doubt, are capable of getting good grades. As long as you remain motivated and work hard, you should breeze through. 

5) For every GCSE you choose to take, find out which exam board is writing the exam, and find a textbook that caters to that exam board. So for example you might be doing an AQA English GCSE. In that case, simply search online for a AQA GCSE English textbook. Buy it, and work your way through it, INCLUDING all the exercises. Studying is easy. Keeping motivated is the hard bit.

Yes, I understood why you pointed out smoking. You could also have mentioned driving cars, sitting down too much, eating too much processed food, drinking too much milk or alcohol, eating too much meat (of any colour), worrying too much, mental health issues, base jumping, ascending Mount Everest and so on.

&gt; Yet anything even approaching the level of anti smoking campaigns would be hurled out as offensive.  
  
Well that's to be proven because they aren't at those levels yet. And given that anti-smoking campaigns were originally called offensive it strikes me there's little to be gained from this line of reasoning.
    
&gt; also... one man's humiliation is another's education... some people don't like the truth.  
  
Equivocation. You're taking 'education' in the sense of 'an enlightening experience', and then, by extension saying that by ""making someone feel ashamed and foolish by injuring their dignity and pride"" you can enlighten them. This is occasionally true. It's not, however, the same as health education intented to exhort the public at large to lead a healthy lifestyle, which would be education in the sense of ""systematic instruction"". This can be an englightening experience, but is not aimed at making someone feel ashamed and foolish.

I know generally LSBU is a bit of a joke - the computers dont work, the students are terrible, think turning up ten minutes before the end of a two hour lecture is the same as turning up on time and you're lucky if the faculty office only loses half your coursework.

That said, I think that given your position, you'd be shit out of luck if you did this foundation year and then transferred elsewhere. Despite its faults, LSBU was always pretty flexible with working around your schedule and I think I'm right in saying that your course is not accredited or standardised by an outside body like mine was (Engineering, so IMECHE accredited) which would make it significantly harder to transfer.

I would advise that you stick with it certainly for at least the first year of a degree course (and probably the second) before you look around to transfer to a different university having got a copy of your transcript, which should hopefully have some good grades at that point. If youre feeling particularly daring you could ask to cash out your first or second year of study for Certificate of Higher Education or Diploma of Higher Education (Cert/Dip He) but this limits you to going back into a university at some point - employers have no fucking idea what these things are so they're basically for accrediting that youve completed one or two years at university. You might be shit out of luck here, too, because you would need to check the university documentation to see if they will actually award these things - IE, this is not a guaranteed route.

Essentially at this point you have a bunch of shit A levels and no evidence that you can actually study at degree level. Sticking with it for at least a year or two and getting good grades shows that you can actually do this work despite the terrible A level grades. 

Or, failing that, just stick with it for three years until you get a degree. It will be an incredible education not only in your subject, but mindless bureaucracy, other people's incompetence and insane policy. Everything required for the realm of work in industry.

Building one subsea HVDC cable is not the same as integration. For one thing it's business model requires there to be a price difference between the two markets to make any money, which is required for maintenance costs that are quite high due to the age of the thing. It has a lot of outages.

Creating a single energy market where a trip in Spain can be almost instantaneously restored using restoration power from Poland is integration and could only be done on a EU level.

Building more subsea cables between Great Britain* and the Continental Europe/Nordic Region on top of the two that exist would create greater integration, but only at the cost of billions of pounds, to which the EU will contribute.

&gt;

&gt;___Threads___ is a 1984 [BAFTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA) award-winning British [television drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_drama), produced jointly by the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC), [Nine Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Network) and Western-World Television Inc. Written by [Barry Hines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Hines) and directed by [Mick Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jackson_(film_director\)), it is a [docudrama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docudrama) account of [nuclear war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare) and its effects on the city of [Sheffield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield) in [Northern England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England).

&gt;The primary plot centres on two families, the working-class Kemps and the middle-class Becketts, as a confrontation between the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) and the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) erupts and escalates. As the United Kingdom prepares for war, the members of each family deal with their own personal crises. Meanwhile, a secondary plot centred upon the Chief Executive of [Sheffield City Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_City_Council) serves to illustrate the British government's then-current [continuity of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_government) arrangements. As nuclear exchanges between [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) and the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact) begin, the harrowing details of the characters' struggle to survive the attacks and their aftermath is dramatically depicted. The balance of the story details the fate of each family as the characters face the medical, economic, social and environmental consequences of nuclear war.

&gt;Shot on a budget of Â£250,000â350,000, the film was notable in being the first of its kind to depict a [nuclear winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter). Certain reviewers have nominated *Threads* as the ""film which comes closest to representing the full horror of nuclear war and its aftermath, as well as the catastrophic impact that the event would have on human culture"". It has been compared to the earlier programme *[The War Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Game)* produced in Britain in the 1960s and its contemporary *[The Day After](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After)*, a 1983 [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company) [television film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_film) depicting a similar scenario in the United States.

You could also have mentioned driving cars, sitting down too much, eating too much processed food, drinking too much milk or alcohol, eating too much meat (of any colour), worrying too much, mental health issues, base jumping, ascending Mount Everest and so on.

no i couldnt, smoking is a direct comparison because of the cost to the NHS and the 'movements' which sought to tell us it was acceptable previously... the same cant be said for the rest of your examples. cept for Everest currently.

&gt;Well that's to be proven because they aren't at those levels yet. And given that anti-smoking campaigns were originally called offensive it strikes me there's little to be gained from this line of reasoning.

sadly they are not, not sure about your reasoning about what help it would be because fatties clims things are offensive just like smokers used to.

&gt;Equivocation. You're taking 'education' in the sense of 'an enlightening experience', and then, by extension saying that by ""making someone feel ashamed and foolish by injuring their dignity and pride"" you can enlighten them. This is occasionally true. It's not, however, the same as health education intented to exhort the public at large to lead a healthy lifestyle, which would be education in the sense of ""systematic instruction"".

Iâm 34 and have learned I prefer mostly matte, neutral eyes, subtle tightlining and natural, glowy skin with a nude or mlbb lip but most importantly Iâve learned itâs okay stick to what you love and look best in, even if that's 'boring'.  To me makeup trends are like clothing trends - not everyone suits them, and you might look back in 5 years and think wtf...  

I only started wearing makeup regularly once I hit my 30s so acquired a pretty big collection in a small amount of time. Like you I bought stuff to wear but also was learning what works/suits me so ended up with a lot of stuff I didn't use because maybe it was too bright a colour or wrong formula etc. I started following /r/makeuprehab last autumn and this allowed me to really start taking a critical look at what I had and what I was using...and what was just sitting untouched.  Like you, I had a lot of things that were barely used.  In fact I destashed my Naked 2 then and havenât once missed it.  Itâs a gorgeous palette, but so much shimmer! I did another collection cull after the new year when I was getting into major project panning.  

Iâve now got really into the Konmari method stuff and have a bunch of stuff waiting to list on MUE again â and this time Iâm getting rid of stuff I might love but is just sitting unused.  I first went through and set stuff aside in a plastic tub away from my makeup.  Then went back a couple weeks later and did a more critical destash.  Kept in tub for another couple weeks and in all that time I have only once pulled one item out that I missed having.  Perhaps you could try something similar to figure out if youâd really miss using things (not having, but using!). My belief is there is zero point in my keeping something, no matter how pretty or quality it is, if I am not going to use it!  And since I can only use so much makeup at once, if I donât use it and just let it sit then it will just go to waste.  I would much rather pass it to someone who will appreciate and use it.  Be careful also not to get caught up in the sunk cost fallacy.  Maybe break it down into stages of getting rid of stuff, and start with the ones you are least likely to miss? good luck!

But lets switch it and say 18 year olds can get JSA, now the worse case scenario is a young person who spends 2 years on the dole having never worked in their life and have therefore lost several key things: 
 - Experience in the work place which can be applied across all work places (like punctuality and communication skills).
- Progress into higher education: If you turned 16/17 and didn't get the grades to progress you could boost them going to college. But past a certain age it is no longer free (not sure, 19?).
- Higher education, if you are on the dole for a year then decide to go to uni, they are going to be asking you what you did and why for that year where there is a gap in your CV/Resume.

I guess what I'm trying to say is: Going on benefits at 18 is the worst possible thing you could do. 

That being said.

Stop making fucking excuses, your life is yours to live, and at 18 you will have more opportunities to progress then quite possibly at any point in your whole working life. If you want to not work, that's fine.

It's baffling. Absolutely baffling. I had hoped that some of the acquisitions/loans last season were a shade cheaper on the wage bill, but that turns out to have been wishful thinking. Looking back, when they (especially Redknapp) talked about getting players off the wage bill, they released the likes of DJ Campbell and Rob Hulse, who were unlikely to have been the highest earners. The only other players clean off the outgoings must have been Remy, Granero and Taarabt. So on top of the ludicrous wages that were already hanging aroudn the club's neck, they went nuts and tacked on an array of mediocre/academy top flight players accustomed to the corresponding wages. I can still reel off all the names...O'Neil, Dunne, Karl Henry, Benayoun, Simpson, Kranjcar, Assou-Ekotto, Tom Carroll, Will Keane, Modibo Maiga, Aaron Hughes, Kevin Doyle. Then of course you have Austin and Phillips on top. Fair enough one or two worked out ok, but from a point of view of controlling the wages, there appears to have been zero caution exercised.

Our foreign policies will continue to allow factions like ISIS to be able to recruit. I cannot see how immigration can be blamed for it? Surely these people would join wherever they resided?

These people would not be in the UK if we'd have only let in people that had moderate religious views and shared our values. You don't get the children of secular liberals going off to join them. And we're making the same mistakes again: many of the Syrian and Iraqi immigrants we let in today will have kids going off to fight in the latest Middle Eastern War in 2035. 

&gt; I don't see how UKIP are more in a position to deal with the sexual abuse scandal more than anyone else? I certainly don't believe that nonsense regarding the Rochdale abuse that the police etc ""Didn't want to seem racist."" No, they fucked up and looked for a poor, poor excuse.

If you read the independent report into Rotherham, it's very clear that concern about appearing racist was a major issue. In one case, someone that raised the issue was sent on diversity training. Others were warned off looking into it further for reasons of ""community relations"". Go and read the Jay report yourself if you don't believe me. 

&gt; My main gripe with UKIP is not actually their immigration policy. I don't actually have strong opinions about it but what really, really annoys me is the absurd rhetoric that they are a ""party for the average bloke"" etc. that Farage seems to constantly push. They're not. Not even close. So he's trying to attract votes from working class/lower working class groups when in reality they would be shooting themselves in the foot by doing so.

That is your particular view because you presumably think left of centre economic views are what most helps working class groups. People like me disagree: we think what would most help people from these backgrounds are removing the pressures of immigration, making low skilled labour more scarce, reducing food bills by leaving the EU CAP, and bringing back more grammar schools.

null,false,TheSolidState,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridge,null,"I wrote to the three major parties asking what they would do about mass surveillance, and so far only the Lib Dems and Labour have replied. 

Labour's reply was a link to their manifesto, in which it says contradictory things (they want stronger rights to privacy *and* more powers to GCHQ, or something like that).

The Lib Dems reply was mainly about increasing oversight of the ISC and I guess the IPT.  One of my questions was ""would you dismantle the TEMPORA programme"", but they didn't directly answer that.  They do have the Digital Bill of Rights though, which is a pretty good read.

I get the impression that although some parties have a better stance than others on the overarching issue of civil liberties, you can't judge whether a particular MP will be against mass surveillance just based on which party they're in.  For example, Julian Huppert (Lib Dem) speaks out strongly against it, but Martin Horwood (also Lib Dem) seems to be vaguely in favour since GCHQ is in his constituency.

David David is a Conservative who is strongly against surveillance, but Michael Ellis, another conservative seems to be strongly for it (and comes across as a massive dick in the meantime).

I would recommend reading [this debate](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm) that was organised by Huppert in Westminster Hall about the mass surveillance.

This is my point: that Farage's threat to cut BBC funding has nothing to do with the format of the Question Time debate.  
I'm not even sure who made the final decision on the format, but if Farage were unhappy with it, he could have made his point many times before now.

I don't see how it would have been different even if the BBC _were_ cut back like he suggests. They've already had massive cuts with a Conservative Chancellor holding the purse-strings; so by that logic, it would have been in the BBC's financial interest to bugger the Tories' chances too.

Personally, I think Farage just wants to turn the BBC into a chastened and obedient puppet broadcaster that'll do anything it's told by people in charge (especially when he's in charge) for fear of being abolished completely.

Farage's very own RT.

It depends - even when you notice it it's still effective on the whole.  Words and phrases are repeatedly dripped into your consciousness like a Chinese water-torture, and if you bang the same words into people's ears for long enough, eventually they start coming out their mouths - it's a form of brainwashing.

At a more subtle level, however, you only notice the narrative-building when it *is* overt and transparent.  When it's more subtle it's no less effective, but you don't notice it.  So when you think ""narrative building"" you remember only the ham-fisted, patently obvious examples and conclude the whole idea is trite and obvious, because when it's done well and fools you into having your thinking influenced you *never even realise* it happened.

No it isn't. It's an additional 9% in income tax on earnings over Â£21,000, for a limited period.

&gt; Already our education pays for itself through higher taxation rates of higher earners.

Well either your education is valuable enough to you that it's going to be financially worthwhile even with the extra income tax you'll be paying in the form of student loan payments, or your education isn't that valuable in the first place. In either scenario why should (primarily worse-off) taxpayers that haven't benefited from a university education pay for you?

&gt; The government decided it was pertinent to burden a whole generation to poor living standards for a number of years out of uni through no doing of their own.

If you honestly think that paying 9% of your income over Â£21k (rising with inflation) will ""burden you with poor living standards"", get out of your little bubble and come join the real world. In fact, by the time you're paying *anything at all* [you'll be earning more than most single adult households in the UK](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/25/uk-incomes-how-salary-compare).

We met him when he gave us a tour of the House of Commons in London.  Whilst we appreciated him taking time out to show us around, he was very full of himself.  He spent the entire visit talking about himself and everything he has done, and how popular he is.  'I did this for the community, then I did this for the community, I'm the only MP that comes to every session in Parliament, I did this for the community'.  I get that he's an MP, and that's how MPs get elected, but it seemed very forced and very full on to spend every second of the visit being that way, without even trying to find out anything about us or our thoughts.  He did buy us a coffee in the Commons bar though, so there's that (although he'll probably just claim it back).

Then the liar part.  Again, probably a little harsh.  We have spoken to him to discuss a few issues that were coming up in parliament.  He's very accessible, and easy to contact.  Several times he has reassured us that he would be voting one way, then gone into the Commons and voted completely the opposite way.  Again, this may be how MPs are in general, but it leaves a very sour taste and leaves you feeling that they don't really stand for you.

The thing I really object to however, is how he has such a popular following in Bolsover, based on nothing but the fact that people have always voted for him, and it's just the way it is.  Labour's policies are likely the polar opposite one can get from the local populous' opinions, who are on the whole probably more in line with UKIP or worse.

I quite like you on here though so I am going to explain a little. Also please bear in mind that I was there in 2006 when the idea that housing could collapse was laughable and anyone who even suggested it was quite literally attacked.

AIG and the other insurance players were some of the most vile and greedy organisations on the planet. They were also full of the most comically stupid people you have ever met.

AIG had been approaching us and just about every other bank on the street asking us to find new and creative ways to package mortgages to get whatever yield they could.

When some of us started seeing an issue in the market back in 07 we were laughed at. In fact worse than that we nearly lost our jobs. You need to understand this was the golden egg and everyone wanted to drink the kool aid. No one wanted to believe the magic money tree would ever die.

I sat in a meeting where one of our lead guys explained some of the risks that AIG was taking in the structured products they were buying and watched him get laughed at. By a bunch of completely incompetent insurance pricks who didn't have a clue about finance. I am not exaggerating when I tell you I sat in a meeting where a senior executive at AIG told us 'housing has never and will never fall. You guys are idiots if you think it ever will'. Then he rattled off some stats about immigration, population etc etc as people who own houses always love to do.

So what did we do? We packaged up some of the shittiest mortgages we could find with the worst yield and we sold it to them. They wanted to be sold this. Then we took the other side.

Now I was quite junior at the time but I watched as slowly but surely other banks clued onto what was going on and started following. Of course some of them Cough Lehman and Merill cough never really bought into it and went under.

Anyway you know what happened next.

Don't feel sorry for AIG though. They were nasty, greedy fuckers who were warned plenty of times about what they were doing and didn't give a shit.

Then they went to the government to request a bailout and then claimed it was only because greedy Goldman wanted to get paid back. Having said that did we want get paid back? Of course we did. If you lose a bet you pay up. Those are the rules.

Anyway there's my side. Things aren't black and white. We could have been wrong and we would have had to pay out if we were. No one would have felt sorry for us and I would probably have lost my job. I staked a lot on that and was the better for it. We certainly wouldn't have been bailed out like AIG was. I also like to believe we have enough integrity as a firm that we wouldn't have tried to blame someone else for our own awful decisions but we'll never know.

And yeah I got paid big time in 09. The bank made billions from those trades. When you make billions someone is going to get paid decent bonuses. I was junior at the time by the way.

Well, it's a view but it's a fact that Nigel is from an investment banking backround, backed by an ex tory millionaire and his policies speak for themselves. Tax breaks for top earner, inheritance tax scrapped, not regulations for city bankers, mp's freedom over their expenses.

For me, the most important thing is taking power away from corporations that can seemingly pay no tax, influence government and control sections media. I mean, people talk about immigrants claiming benefits but that is nothing compared to the amount we lose from huge corporations paying no tax.

null,false,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,null,"At University we had a module on calculating the net present value cost of finance. Essentially for a business, an activity either has to be funded by equity or by borrowing. No different really for a government funding it's activities with tax receipts or borrowing.

The interesting thing is that a *well-financed* business will blend the two sources of fudning to get the lowest cost - if you have too much equity-funded activity (or too much tax) it ends up being really costly. If you have too much borrowing, it ends up being really costly (and risky!).

Most governments seem very content to pretend that all debt financing is bad, even if they're paying 0.5% interest on that, vs taxation where tax is actually relatively damaging (it works out to 'equivalent' of 30% cost of finance if you want to do back of the envelope maths). Then again, the return on our investments may be as high as 120%, so austerity is saying 'we don't want to borrow at 0.5% to get 120% back in goods &amp; services, nor tax at 30%, because we don't BELIEVE in a big government. Though we will tax a bit more at 30% (VAT rise) so we can reduce the borrowing at 0.5%.'

It's just confusing to me, people do say there are other factors like sending messages to the markets and setting an example to the rest of the world which is why you would choose suboptimal financing options. But essentially we have rich people wanting to give us money at rock-bottom rates, us saying 'no thanks', then increasing VAT on the goods and services which disproportionately affect the poor (they spend greater %age of their income vs. investment or saving).

Depends why their feelings are hurt. If they're hurt because you're being a cunt then it's up to you (this is the general you, btw, not you specifically) to not be a cunt.  
If they're upset because they're realised they're fat, and that they have a deep sense of self-loathing then there isn't much can do, except try and help them do something to be happier.  
  
My point being: There are ways of going about things that are more condusive to producing the desired results; I'm simply saying we adopt these and avoid ones that don't. It's my understanding that trying to humiliate people into doing stuff tends to work less well than encouraging them.

Overweight, or obese?  Because many common monogenic or mono epigenetic variants, operating via appetite alteration, are associated with increased weight by several kilos.  Enough to make someone overweight.  The consultant also fails to appreciate, as many people do here, that while monogenic, high penetrance, high impact causes of obesity are relatively rare, polygenic causes are evidently common, given the missing heritability of obesity.

I think of it sometimes as being akin to the Marshall program after WW2. In that instance the Americans saw that they needed to help re-build the economies of the western European nations in order to ensure they had strong allies in Europe as a bulwark to the USSR.

Similarly with some of the eastern bloc countries we can already see their economies improving a quicker pace than might otherwise have been the case. To be sure, it's a long term project taking decades rather than years.

Neither of those causes the obesity epidemic, nor is anyone bar the misguided arguing it does.  Genetic susceptibility influences individual variation and risk.

null,false,Colonel_Blimp,null,null,null,"&gt; As for the morning star talk about anti-fascists I feel they're right to do so as a counter balance to the BBC etc who completely ignore them. Take the Azov battalion as the most popular for displaying Nazi insignia every one of them wheres a badge with a nazi related symbolism on it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion[1] to deny there are fascists in Ukraine is insane and dangerous.

[The BBC haven't ignored them.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28329329) No-one is denying there are far right groups in Ukraine. We knew that from Euro 2012 and Ukrainian history, let alone this conflict! However the Russian media paints them as the driving force behind the Ukrainian government and its forces (falsely) and uses it to justify Russia's actions. 

&gt; The conservative working class do exist, I prefer to call them reactionary, typically under educated, my grandad for instance has never read a book in his life according to him and spouts the stuff the mainstream news says apart from things like gay marriage which he's against... I've tried saying to him before how does gay marriage affect you and he said it doesn't and I said well then, but he still parrots the whole man and woman line. He's also in favour of the death penalty and also says things like ""Don't let them back into the country"" when talking about jihadis, I'm hesitant to say the latter in case any impressionable kids went and realised they made a mistake and I'm very against the death penalty just because it's not as quick and painless as people make it out to be.

Yeah, problem is they're not all like your grandad or my nan - I was out on the doorstep for Labour in Rochester and there was a woman there who was middle aged and she had been working in the NHS for 30 years and voting Labour her whole voting life. She's now voting UKIP because she doesn't feel any left wing party - not just Labour - tackle her concerns. I met younger people voting UKIP, although they were smaller in number. 

I'm against the death penalty too but on jihadis, yeah, there will be kids who go over to Syria thinking they're doing the right thing then realise what they get involved in - the idea of revoking their citizenship is bad certainly as it is because then people who are still committed to terrorism are harder to track. However, it is sadly very true that of the portion of people volunteering for such conflict zones who volunteer for specifically pro-IS or anti-Western groups, or who went to fight in the Taliban etc, they remained committed to those ideals and you can't really ignore that. They're an immediate security risk the moment they get home so the minimum you can do is keep an eye on them. The Green policy idea of not making it illegal to just *join* these organisations without having done anything yet was the most naive and frustrating thing.

&gt; Going back to the marriage thing, I'm personally against all marriage and I find atheist who get married 'in the eyes of god' to be highly hypocritical. Later when I read anarchist material the whole 'marriage is just confirming a partnership to the state (being an oppressive entity)' resonated with me.

Secular marriage is now a thing, and hopefully gay marriage will continue to be. I can't really say much about your anarchist ideology to be fair, I'm not going to lecture you on what I think is wrong with it (a lot :P) so I'll just say I respect your opinion.

&gt; Also I'd urge if you would please stop saying 'far left' because I consider myself left to far left but on the libertarian end of the scale and not the authoritarian.

I'm not assuming far left = authoritarian if that's what you mean. ""Far left"" in my phraseology encompasses the far left regardless of their position in the authoritarian/libertarian scale. 

&gt; If the west wanted a war with a country, say Iran which was and is still possible, I'd be against it, I wrote my MP on the issue which he basically just glossed over with drivel in a reply. 

Who is your MP? Its highly likely they have zero impact on the foreign policy making decision process beyond their vote in Parliament if it comes to it, and they probably get letters about that sort of thing a lot of the time. A lot of MP's to my knowledge sort of filter out stuff that would be better addressed to the PM or a newspaper letters section. 

War with Iran has been pretty unlikely since the first couple of years after Iraq. There's no reason for it as sanctions have been effective in bringing Iran to the table over Western concerns about nuclear weapons, and the political appetite for interventionism at the moment is so, so low it would be unthinkable. 

&gt; It's for the people of Iran to remove their government ideally, the West has a history (libya &amp; syria) of getting involved in countries and causing havoc in the region. 

We didn't get involved in Syria in the end beyond the Americans supplying TOWs and such to the FSA and moderate rebel groups. Personally I was against intervention at the time, now I'm less sure because with hindsight the continuation of the conflict has permitted both the rise of IS in Syria *and* the survival of Assad. Then again the rise of IS in Iraq is a long term effect of the Iraq invasion, so what can you do?

Libya was actually pretty justifiable and moreover a decisive military success. The mistake made was that Western countries failed to invest proper money and time into Libya *after* the intervention because they were distracted by issues at home. And its important to remember that Libya WAS in havoc before we intervened, and a massacre was imminent in Benghazi. 

&gt; I've been an RT regular view for years now and can point out their rubbish and that of the western press quite easily, lately I've been reading anarchist stuff (50th time I've said this) http://anarchistnews.org/[2] is a good site. Essentially the more you read the better, unfortunately the majority of the working people do not have time to read and if they were going to be reading papers and news sites I'd prefer they were exposed to anti-war sentiment in the morning star than fearmongering from the daily mail (I'm trying to get family and extended family to stop reading this rubbish). 

The problem is that Russia Today is very, very clearly subject to editorial interference if not control and directorship from the Kremlin. Watching it to counter the Daily Mail when you don't even read it doesn't give you a balanced or somewhat accurate vision of the world, it just makes you a victim of a successful misinformation campaign led by a channel that benefits from being more subtle than Fox News and masquerading as an independent journalist organisation. I know you've said you can ""point out their rubbish"", but I find that hard to believe. They're just not a credible source for information and the editorial bent behind all of their stories is exactly the same. It is *all* tainted.

I did note you said you read anarchist stuff, that's fair enough but I don't personally subscribe to their worldview (and I doubt that website shares the editorial integrity of the some of the more centrist papers it would slag off.) Seems like an inherent problem to me that if the entirety of the social structure and institutions surrounding them are supposed to be brought down they'll have zero reason to be accurate or sympathetic to any of them. 

&gt; The centrist parties are pushing the whole should we give more benefits or less benefits so workers feel the benefit, if you ask someone ""What about if the workers control the means of production so they earn more instead of one person giving the profits to himself, that way we can tax people to support the unemployed and you won't be skint."" and then they look at you with glazed eyes as though you are talking foreign, the mainstream press or politicians don't ever put this line across because it isn't in their interests. 

People *do* make these arguments, but the reason they're not in the political mainstream is because they're ideas just don't carry the same weight and popularity as those espoused by say the Labour Party. Its not because everyone else is dumb and anarchists know the real truth or something. The fact is 95% of people don't have any interest in having the system which they are used to and which is relatively stable and prosperous demolished because of the words of a small proportion of the population who are much further to the left than the rest of us. Nor do they represent credible political opposition - government is *hard*, but when you're in opposition whoever you are, there's a tendency to forget that completely.

&gt; Imagine if we had a citizens income as the greens are proposing as a future goal,

The Citizens Income is one of those nice ideas in theory that a party which has no chance of governing ever comes up with that would be impractical to implement and probably bankrupt the country. Also the vision of giving everyone in the country this universal stipend at massive cost when some don't need it at all, when for many it won't be enough to make a meaningful difference when its damaging the economy they're part of...nah, sorry. The current benefits system is flawed but its at least realistic.

It's no different from reading a book for your information, so long as you list your sources and use multiple from valid sources that back up your claim then I don't see why not, students should learn how to use Google effectively, because it's basically a giant encyclopaedia. I'm only in favour however so long as there is two test papers like they said, a google one and a none-google one. Students also need to know how to find answers independent of some sources, using only the tools they learned, that includes not using calculators (like how you have a calculator and none-calculator paper).

Also, I would exactly say it's no different from using a calculator. Using a calculators requires that you understand the mathematical processes and rules. If you square a number, but don't know what square means then it doesn't matter what answer you get, you won't understand it. And that's where we have to be careful, we have to make sure the tests identify that the students understand what they're writing down on the paper and are not just simply copying.

If you was a mathematician you would just ask a colleague what the equation is or look it up in a book or on the internet, you wouldn't go ""ah right, project over, I forgot"" or if you're by yourself and you didn't know, then you would just use your knowledge of mathematics to derive the equation, which isn't hard. It's only being able to use the equation that should matter and understanding it, not remember it precisely, especially considering some equations can be a bit of annoying to remember.

Suggestions: 

Friendly and comfortable atmosphere is key. Some comics shops have narrow rows of tables/shelves, sometimes with dense boxes of single-issues. Great for people looking for a specific issue, but it holds no interest for me. I'd love to see tables and chairs, sofas and coffee tables, to feel comfortable browsing and even reading the comics before buying. I buy graphic novels, and a new one is a lot of money, so I need to be able to read the first few pages, or an issue first to see if I like it. Currently I use Waterstones, and they have chairs and little cushioned nooks you can sit on when you browse the books. You can even sneak a book into the coffee shop upstairs to read over a coffee. This is an amazing treat and unless you've got similar, I'm worried you won't be able to compete with Waterstones. The Oxford shop has one of the best selections of graphic novels I've ever seen in a non-specialist shop so they'll be a massive competitor.

It'll be very tough to beat Amazon and Waterstones if you're just a traditional shop. I'd love to see some out-of-the-box thinking. How about a lending library like Video shops used to do? There's loads of comics I'd love to read but don't want to fill up my limited shelf space at home by buying them for myself (and my wife would kill me). I'd be happy to pay a small monthly subscription to be allowed to borrow comics and books whenever I wanted. Perhaps there could be other perks to being a monthly subscriber, such as free unlimited filter coffee.

Also, perhaps you could have a few iPads around loaded with a library of electronic comics. These can be read by customers without damaging the paper. 

Also, make Marvel and DC more understandable. Unless you read them continuously ever week, you can get ridiculously lost. You should have a wall a chart showing the big events, storylines, crossovers etc. and how they correspond to the graphic novel editions on offer.

Don't just keep everything alphabetical, again, this is easy to navigate for people who already know what they're looking for. But doesn't help random browsing. Take a leaf from Waterstones again and do what they do for their books. Have tables or stands of picked titles that you recommend, based around certain themes. 

Hope these suggestions help. best of luck with getting this off the ground. I'd love to know when it's ready.",null,0,null,1430480399,null,0,false,0,cquwgju,null,t3_30hd5y,null,t1_cquwgju,null,t3_30hd5y,null,null,null,1432710857,null,1,false,oxford,t5_2rc7b,1,null

null,false,Dwengo,cnty-expat,London,null,"I sometimes feel that the only way to bring the housing market down without crashing it is for a government to nationalise a construction company and slowly ramp up construction on properties, this would force competing companies to either get in on the act while prices rise at record rates (helping to ease demand, and allowing the nationalised company to ease off on the number of houses it builds) or they continue to do nothing an go bust.^1

The nationalised construction company could be funded by a ""Property Assets purchase tax"" which -should- be levied on any person purchasing a property who does not intend to live in it (As in they see it as an asset and not their home).^2

This would mean all those foreign investors spending millions on properties in London and the south east would be taxed at a reasonable amount, say 8%  + stamp duty. This money could then be used to build more houses.

Plus, all houses being built should not be advertised outside of the UK until up to 3 months after it has been built, by law.

In addition, during this time, unless you reside in this country or have a visa application granted, you should not be allowed to make a purchase or an offer on said house during the 3 month period.^3

For the construction companies. If a property is up and for sale and they have received offers that match or beat the guide price, they must accept the highest offer PRIOR to the 3 month grace period, and can only sell internationally if no offer from residents residing in the UK has matched the guide price.

""thanks for fixing the housing crisis"".

You're welcome, Britain





^1 - Current Construction companies are building slowly for a reason, if houses rise at roughly [12% anually](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-1671748/House-prices-What-expect-news-predictions.html)  in the south east, well then it makes financial sense to artificially keep demand down. in order to push profits up year on year.

^2 - An additional purchase tax on properties that you don't intend to make your home should have a two fold effect, it will lower demand, and it will raise cash. Everyone bleats on about the need for Landlords, this is true, we already have millions of them and I'm not saying get rid of all landlords, I'm saying, lets throttle the number of wannabe landlords so that only the cream cut it.

^3 - Foreign investors see the UKs houses as one of the best investments, you show me a bank account that nets you up to 16% interest every year, and if you can be bothered with the hassle, how does [Â£48,000 gross annual income](http://www.londonpropertywatch.co.uk/average_rental_prices.html) sound from renting that house that you're never going to live in, out....

It's not as if we can leap to an alternate dimension and see whether Inter would be performing better if it weren't for him being in and out of the papers, getting investigated by the police for inciting the crowd etc.

Balotelli's the same. In and out of the papers. 

We've just come off the back of Suarez biting people and being in the rags every fucking day, making us look like a shit club, now we've got the bottom-feeders focusing on Balotelli, Sterling etc. Do we really need the 'Wife stealing Icardi comes to Liverpool' or 'Is Liverpool FC where rotten players go to die' headlines too?

Yeah, he's a great player (as I acknowledged in my opening comment) but we make no secret of the fact that we try to recruit decent family men of a certain reputation. We always have. Icardi's another one who would just be tabloid-fodder.

&gt;Apart from scoring 18 goals in 31 games I mean. Incitement and volatile temprement? Yeah, 5 yellow cards in 40 games. 

And causing on-field strife, winding up players, winding up the crowd. 

Have you ever actually watched the lad play? It isn't all numbers on a page. Real football isn't Champ Manager. 

If you take what he can give you, then subtract what damage he'll potentially do, you decide whether he's a risk worth taking. Suarez was. Balotelli wasn't. What would Icardi be?

&gt;You'll remember the striker we had last year got banned for fucking biting. 

Yeah, and that was wonderful for the club wasn't it? The threat of losing sponsors, being in the papers all the time for negative shite. Getting called a 'racist club'. It was ace. I held my head up high as a red then, didn't you?

&gt;Emre Can got into an on field scuffle with a team mate, can't say that I regret Liverpool buying him. 

Are you fucking serious? Badstuber kicked him up in the air during a training game and Can told him to fuck off. It was hardly pistols at dawn. We've had far worse than that at Melwood.

&gt; Ryan Giggs continuously pumped his brother's wife while at Man Utd and then put out an injunction

More negative publicity. Just because it isn't *still* in the papers daily, doesn't mean it didn't do damage. When it happened United's PR people went garrity trying to mitigate the fallout. We don't need more of the same.

&gt;Why would Icardi show up in the media at all at the moment? He's settled.

Yeah, so has Balotelli. He's hardly done a thing wrong but the press, being the arseholes that they are, have been on at him, and by extension us, since he signed.

For all I know Icardi could sign and be angelic, both on and off the pitch, but his previous would be like carrion to the tabloid press.",null,0,null,1430481817,null,0,false,0,cquwvlg,null,t3_34fmpo,null,t1_cquwvlg,null,t1_cquvkuv,null,null,null,1432711054,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

So you may need to queue to get in depending on what time of day and where you are voting, but that's a rarity. That being said, if you leave it til the last minute you may be blocked from voting even if you're in the queue.

Once you get in, you will be asked your name and address and your entry will be crossed off a list. You will be given your polling for or forms (some places have local council elections or mayoral elections on the same day)

You take these forms into the voting booth (not really a booth these days) where there will be a pencil on a string attached to the wall. There will be a poster with information about the candidates and instructions on how to fill in the form. For the general election, you just put 1 ""x"" in the box for the candidate you want. That's it. Anything else will invalidate your vote. Fold the sheet in half and then post it in the big scary looking box.

If you are in any way not sure, there's loads of people working there who will help you out.

After you vote, that's it. As you leave you might be asked who you voted for. **YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ANSWER**  parties and media carry out their own exit polls but they have no authority to do so and you have no obligation to answer.

Anything that symbolises your membership of a sectarian organisation is a sectarian symbol, and a march by a sectarian organisation is a sectarian march.

Some have him amongst the 'dressing room fall out' rumour, where a few players were rumoured to have caused a rebellion, they are mistaking him for Etienne Capoue. Stambouli was never originally stated to be a part of this.

Stambouli has played very well in the few games he played for us. He is probably the most aggressive defensive mid we have amongst the team, making clear impacts in the games he played.

Firstly, what happens when another recession hits? We still haven't even fully recovered from the last one yet, the deficit is still 5% of GDP now, and public debt is still rising YoY.

We also already pay approx 3% of GDP yearly in interest payments, which is about a third of the entire NHS budget. How much is too much?

Just because we can borrow at apparently decent rates doesn't necessarily mean we should. We don't even really understand exactly how low our effective interest rate really is, because we don't know what inflation will be like over the next 20 years. 2.5% interest on a 20 year bond sounds good, but if inflation over the next 20 years ends up averaging 0% then actually that's not a particularly fantastic rate. Of course inflation could just as easily average 3% and it ends up that we're being paid to take money from bond investors, but that's just it: We don't know what's around the corner.

Borrowing further will always be a risk, and while I agree government investment in infrastructure should be higher than it currently is, that money does not need to come from further borrowing if there are tax rises and/or further spending cuts.

EDIT: Just to add, there's also the giant elephant that is QE in the room.

The counter-argument being that it shows that the UK political system is somewhat broken if the party Scotland votes for is shunned, despite obvious policy overlaps, purely because of a long-term goal that's of no relevance to this parliament (or probably the next few either).

The biggest danger with Miliband being so forthright is that people in Scotland feel he's  rejecting *Scotland*, not the SNP.

Once you get into the polling station, you should see a table with some people sitting at it (that's me!), go up to them and you'll be asked your name and address - we'll check this in our book. This is to make sure you're given the appropriate ballot papers that you're eligible for and does not compromise the secrecy of your ballot.  
Once you've got your ballot paper(s), go over to the ballot booths and mark a single X in the box next to the candidate of your choice (once per ballot paper), making sure not to make any other marks on the ballot paper as this will void them, and then your vote won't count! Once you're done, fold them once (we should have pre-folded them for you, please don't fold more than once or it'll really annoy the people at the count) and drop them into the correct ballot box - local, Parliamentary, and Parish (not every ward has Parish elections). If at any time you're not sure, just ask! We're there to help and want to make sure that everyone's vote matters, so we'll do our utmost to help you out.

I think most of us would have predicted a finish between 6th and 8th. Frankly given the quality of the other teams in it for the top 7 and the quality of teams 8th and below we were never really going to finish any lower or higher than that regardless of how well or indeed badly we played.  
  
I don't want to lean on the crutch of claiming it's a transitional season too badly (we have been very poor at points in the season). However, it's an unavoidable fact it's been Poch's first season having to deal with what was clearly a pretty unhappy team (Ade aside) post AVB and Sherwood with the now infamous magnificent 7.   
  
We have been unbeaten against what is quite a strong Arsenal team, made it to a cup final and played reasonably well, we've had the full emergence of Kane &amp; Mason. Whilst the general play of the team isn't nearly as exciting as under 'Arry but we look a hell of a lot better than we did under AVB (how I miss that man).
  
To say Poch hasn't achieved anything of note is 1. harsh and 2. not taking who he's managed into context. When he took over Espanyol he was their 3rd manager of the season and took them from a relegation place to 10th, I'd argue that was a pretty decent achievement. He took a Southampton team in it's first premier league season and beat Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea with them. He took us to our first final since 2008. All achievements wouldn't you say?   
  
I will agree that we have tailed off, how much of that is player fatigue, how much of that is playwers being ' on the beach' is hard to tell. I would agree with criticisms that he hasn't rotated enough (I understand why some players don't get a game but others such as Stambouli and Demebele I don't know why they haven't had a few more games).  
   
Next season is where we'll begin to be able to tell. Give him a summer to bring in some of his own players, get rid of a few of the deadwood players and maybe we'll see some more rotation and improved play with a squad he feels he fully trusts :)",null,0,null,1430484452,null,0,false,0,cquxswt,null,t3_34i5h0,null,t1_cquxswt,null,t1_cquwyay,null,null,null,1432711490,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

**However, if you lived here until you were 10:** If you lived in the UK until your 10th birthday (that is, you didn't leave the UK for more than 3 months at a time without ""special reasons"" before you turned 10), then you *can* apply for citizenship under these grounds: [full details are explained here](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/applicationforms/nationality/guide_t.pdf). The relevant legislation is the [British Nationality Act 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1981).

**Failing that...** Immigration into the UK is hard, especially for a non-EU national. If Serbia eventually gains admittance to the European Union, then, depending on what this means for Kosovo, this *might* dramatically improve your chances. Otherwise, your best bet under current immigration law is either to be able to fill a workforce gap (i.e. you'll need to have skills that we're short of, apply for a job here, and your employer will need to be able to demonstrate that they've tried to fill the position with a British citizen but that there genuinely aren't any, *and* they'll need to be willing to go through a lengthy and complicated process to get you here) or to marry a British citizen (and even then, you're likely to need to demonstrate that the relationship is genuine: such as by having been married for a couple of years). Either way, your right to remain in the UK would eventually also depend upon one of our infamous ""Life in the UK"" tests.

Or because of Nick Clegg's mistake about promising no rises in tuition fees? The former has been redeemed as a good decision, while the latter is a single issue in what should be a debate that encompasses all areas.

Personally, I believe Clegg was right to back tuition fee reforms. He was wrong to promise he wouldn't, but he fully believed that the reforms were good, and they are. The reforms have come close to solving the university funding crisis while creating no barriers whatsoever to university access for anyone. More disadvantaged students go to university now than before, and they pay back their tuition fees at a slower rate because repayment rates were lowered. They are fundamentally good reforms that succeed on every level.

The problem was that Clegg misled the public. However, if you look at Milliband's stance on spending cuts, he is seeking to do the exact same thing. By not putting a time limit on his deficit reduction targets Milliband has essentially left himself room to completely reverse deficit reduction if it becomes bad for his poll ratings. Labour are the only party to have done this, and I can't believe more people don't see the reason for the lack of a time limit.

&gt;__Bitcoin__  is an online [payment system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system) invented by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto),  who published his invention in 2008,  and released it as [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) in 2009.  The system is [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer); users can transact directly without needing an intermediary.  :4 Transactions are verified by network [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking\)) and recorded in a public [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database) called the *block chain*.  :ch. 6  The [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) uses its own [unit of account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_account), also called __bitcoin__.  The system works without a central repository or single administrator, which has led the [US Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Treasury) to categorize it as a decentralized [virtual currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_currency).  Bitcoin is often called the first [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency),  although prior proposals existed.  Bitcoin is more correctly described as the first decentralized [digital currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency).   It is the largest of its kind in terms of total market value.

&gt;Catholics can't join. I know the obvious rejoinder to that is, 'Well, it's a protestant organisation, why would they want to join?' Hopefully, you can see the inherent sectarianism in that. If not, consider the following: 'The KKK is a white organisation, why would a black want to join?' 

Race is a matter of birth religion is a matter of choice, anyone can choose to convert to protestantism, after which they are eligible to join.

&gt;Anything that symbolises your membership of a sectarian organisation is a sectarian symbol, and a march by a sectarian organisation is a sectarian march. 

&gt;Given the tendency of such organisations to undertake sectarian activities. such as pissing on chapels,

Wasn't a member of the order and an apology was made that very day. Indeed given the size of that demonstration you have to admit we aren't that bad when the only complaints made that day were against people who weren't members of the organisation.

&gt;playing famine songs, 

Again not our members, however I simply don't know what action the lodge has taken against that band.

&gt;and generally acting like triumphalist knobs, I don't see any persuasive argument that they not be considered sectarian, 

Aside from our laws and ordinances, have you ever heard of the Orange protesting against a chapel?

&gt;never mind be allowed to march **past** the homes of people who aren't even allowed to join their organisation.

We were just traders. Traders bet against things they think are going to go bad. It's what you do. 

There were actually discussions about the size of the bets we made and we might end up taking them down but by that time others had clued on and were starting to do the trade so if we didn't do it they would.

I personally thought we'd end up coming to some kind of settlement with them. Going to the government was something we hadn't ever really considered.

Also and I do want to stress this. I was a junior member of the team back then. This wasn't my 'baby' if it was I'd be stupidly rich. I got paid well but the senior guys on this made 10s of millions.

But Jack is a holding midfielder who sits in front of the defence and has a great ability to pass an hold onto the ball. He is also one of the fitter players in our league and does a lot of box-to-box work (watch his game and goal vs Hamilton, absolute quality game from him).

He should be able to challenge for a first team spot immediately but he isn't a level above any of Evertons players so he would have to work a lot on some more attacking areas of his game.

The only reason he is going for 1 million is due to him only having one year left on his contract and if he had, say, 3 years he would be going for 3+ million.

I think Everton should go for him as he has good quality and still has a lot of potential in him. Jack also somehow hasn't played for Scotland yet although being one of the best players in our league this season.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"**The text for anyone behind a paywall**


Last week I described Anthony Atkinsonâs proposals for reducing inequality. Atkinson â a professor of economics at Nuffield College, Oxford â proposes substantially higher income tax rates for everyone earning more than Â£65,000, a much higher minimum wage, guaranteed public employment, an expansion of universal benefits and much else. It is the agenda one would expect of a courageous Labour party, which of course places it a long way from the agenda that the actual Labour party is proposing.


It seems only fair, then, to offer the same service to the Conservatives: on the off chance that we ever see an economically radical Tory party, what policies might I suggest they embrace?



Step one is to replace the benefit system with a more libertarian form of redistribution. Scrap all the mainstream benefit payments â for example, child benefit, jobseekerâs allowance, housing benefit, winter fuel allowance and even the state pension. Scrap the income tax allowance too. Give all long-term UK residents a taxable basic income of Â£8,000 a year and charge a flat 40 per cent income tax rate on every penny. The basic income can be phased in on a residency basis over 10 years, ensuring that recent immigrants pay a larger net contribution to the exchequer.


This policy targets poverty rather than inequality. It abolishes much of the bureaucracy that surrounds benefit eligibility, promotes individual responsibility and reduces the stigma of collecting money from the state. It gives everyone, rich and poor, a clear incentive to work. Compared to the current system, it redistributes to the working poor and to the highest earners â both groups of people who are likely to produce more taxable income in response. It is simple, discouraging tax avoidance. And, despite the flat headline rate, the average income tax contribution is progressive: negative for those on low incomes, 10-25 per cent for those on average incomes and approaching 40 per cent for the rich.


People with unusual needs â the severely disabled, for instance â would be helped by a multibillion-pound fund with considerable discretion to make direct cash payments or commission assistance from charities.

A second policy is to privatise the entire school system. Children would receive a Â£10,000 basic income in a tax-sheltered educational account controlled by parents but usable only for childcare, school or university fees. Compulsory schooling would end at the age of 14 and educational institutions would be competing to attract these pots of tax-free cash with engaging and practical training courses. Any unspent money would be taxed and handed over to the child at the age of 21.


Third, scrap the personal pension system. Both the logic for and the reputation of the existing system is in tatters. With the new flat tax and universal basic income it would also be superfluous. People can save for their retirement in more flexible Isa-style savings accounts and could be nudged into doing so by a default payroll deduction.



A fourth policy must involve the housing market. The current cluster of housing policies (âclusterâ is a polite abbreviation for a more appropriate term) ensures slow growth, resentment of immigrants, a crippling housing-benefit bill, inequality growing through luck rather than hard work and innovation, and the direction of potentially productive savings into accumulating unproductive housing wealth. This is a multifunctional policy indeed.


Given that housing benefit is to be abolished by this radical government, there is an urgent need to build large numbers of houses. This would boost the economy and reduce the price of new homes. One possibility, proposed by the Centre for Policy Studies, is the establishment of âpink zonesâ with lighter planning regulation (the colour represents a dilution of red tape). In these zones, substantial increases in housing could be achieved by a coalition of local authorities, community groups and developers.


However the trick is pulled off, the government must create the conditions for a housing boom â 400,000 new homes a year for five years would do to begin with. Itâs ambitious, but necessary after decades of insufficient building.



A final idea: look to broaden the tax base and lower tax rates. Abolishing all VAT exemptions would be a good start, and would provide substantial revenue. A carbon tax would also be well worth introducing, as would more proportionate taxation of housing wealth. The proceeds of these taxes would be needed at first to pay for the universal basic income but the aim would be to reduce universal income tax rate too. A future leftwing government could redistribute within the same framework by increasing the basic income.


That should do the trick for the first term but a Conservative government should also commit to staying in the European Union, which stands in favour of trade, business and hard money; and to leaving the National Health Service alone for a few years just to see how it performs when not being incessantly prodded by politicians.


There you have it: a smaller, less bureaucratic state, innovation in education, redistribution to the poorest, a lower but more transparent income tax to attract the rich, an economic boom on the back of much-needed home-building and affordable housing for all.

&gt;Immigration is not a problem.  Its a low quality scapegoat and is used as a smoke screen for housing, NHS and employment issues.  If those areas were ""fixed"" and worked properly, foreigners coming over and paying taxes not be a problem.  

Even if we fix all those issues, it will cost more to fix them with more people needing / using them. If the NHS expects to see patients in a certain amount of time, more people will set it back.

You might think that should lead to a nicely balanced Parliament - for half the time you would have a 60% Labour majority and for half the time a 60% Tory majority. The parties could either take turns being in government, or they could swap around candidates 'at random' so that no party has a workable majority for long (both are defensible on the grounds of 'representativeness' - it depends whether you think it is the will of the country or the aggregate will of the constituancy which should be represented.

But if one party is sneaky, it can instead assign its MPs so that it has a small majority 80% of the time (alternatively, a whopping great majority 20% of the time). Even if you didn't allow any party the power to distribute other party's MPs, they could still try and position themselves for an advantage by manipulating when different numbers of MPs stood.

Its immigration policy was specifically designed to help populate it (the slogan was ""populate or perish"", I think), and it has quite a healthy rate of population growth for a developed country, going into a century when population stagnation and decline will be the reality of many developed countries.

Reducing immigration to the point where it's almost zero net (i.e. almost a ""one in, one out"" rule) is pointless and punitive. This country's population is ageing, and migrant workers help to prop up our economy. Compare with Japan, which has near-nonexistent levels of immigration that UKIP can only dream of, and the world's oldest and fastest-ageing population, and the world's fastest-shrinking workforce. That puts a rather different spin on things than ""look at these evil Poles who want to do work in our country"".

Unfortunately the best bet to deal with the problem using only the law would be to get a court injunction against the *specific* person or people who park there. You'd probably have to demonstrate to the court that the space was clearly marked as being for your use only (or that you'd previously requested that the offender desist). Given that OP will win the injunction, his court costs would be repaid, but that won't do much to take the sting out. After this, it'd certainly be possible to claim restitution for costs incurred by the lack of access to the space... but I'll bet that by the time you've taken legal action against somebody they won't park there again anyway... but somebody else will. :-(",null,0,null,1430487455,null,0,false,0,cquz2vu,null,t3_34hz30,null,t1_cquz2vu,null,t1_cquyl20,null,null,null,1432712093,null,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

It's pretty clear that nobody in our current side is clinical enough in front of goal and it's something we need to deal with in the transfer market.

Sterling and Markovic are absolutely dire in front of goal. Lallana is perpetually injured as well. Nobody in our midfield is a real force going forward either. With the players we currently have, we are so reliant on our actual strikers for goals because everyone else is mediocre.  

Last season we had two world class strikers who would constantly drag defenders out of position opening up a ton of space for the rest of the side. Even then, we were so reliant on our strikers for goals because the same players as last season are still poor in front of goal. Now we have no real threat, and defenders have nothing to worry about. They can sit back knowing we don't really offer anything going forward. It's hard enough when you only have one real threat because the defense can just mark him out of the game. We have absolutely nobody. Even IF sturridge was fit, a front three of Sterling / Sturridge / Markovic would still be quite average because even with all that pace, Sturridge is really the only clinical player.

null,false,MoreTeaPleaseVicar,null,null,null,"Parenting is a battling of wills, on the whole I tend to give in a little easier (dad of  two daughters), but my wife will not budge. As soon as you lose ground and move boundaries on what is acceptable, then kids will push for more. This is never a sudden thing, but its slowly chipped away at over time, until the parent ends up trying to reason with the child and make deals as if their child is their wayward friend. They end saying statements like 'I just don't know what to do with them, will you talk to them?'.

We see this often with kids. Just last week  in the supermarket a little girl was acting like a little shit to be honest. She walked up to my daughter (both about five) and blew a raspberry in her face and threw a toy on the ground. My daughter was just amazed more then upset, she had a look like 'how can you get away with that shit?' and watched aghast. The mum came up, crouched down and said while stroking her arm 'you can't do that darling, that's not very nice to the other little girl, you should say sorry', the little girl just brushed the mum aside. You could tell this girl was heading for a hard life, unless some intervention took place. Its this sort of parenting that thinks if you shout at them, they will be emotionally damaged for life, where as the lack of discipline results in even worse. The child has no concept of social boundaries of others. 

Kind of very grateful for my wife. If my kids step out of line they meet an immovable wall of 'just you try it'. The result of that is, we can take them out anywhere and they are polite and people say what a pleasure they are to have them around.

&gt;If a parent can't spare a few minutes to make a card or find time to do free activities with the child on there birthday I'm more worried about the child then whether or not they get bought cards and presents.

They could do it whilst their clothes are air drying. 

I feel you've missed the point though. This was never about lazy parenting but rather that nobody should have to live in relative poverty. By choosing to see this as parental laziness it's reinforcing the right wing notion that bad things happen because of their own actions which is bullshit.

Throughout history it was noble children who'd be pawned off to a nanny or a wet nurse but that is not considered lazy parenting. The modern equivalent of hiring babysitters or nannies is not considered lazy but it's still parents not spending time with their kids.",null,0,null,1430488642,null,0,false,0,cquzoef,null,t3_34hxza,null,t1_cquzoef,null,t1_cquuawq,null,null,null,1432712373,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"I don't really disagree with you but there is a whole other side to it.  I am not going to pretend large numbers of under regulated, private, state funded landlords is a good system, but right now it is the least bad option open to us short term.

I agree (very strongly) that we should reform housing benefit.  But that's difficult and expensive in time and political capital (look at how the bedroom tax worked out - badly administered, ideologically driven, politically disastrous and not economically effective).

As for why they should turn a profit, that's the only reason anyone does anything in the private sector.  I'd love to say that from now on firms must work society on a no profit basis but that's really not going to work.

Ideally we'd have both a big public housing stock and a sustainable and strategically managed public building program and the private sector would be &lt;5%, supplying just little niches here and there.  But that is also impossible because voters are lazy and greedy.  So whenever the state builds anything, politicians sell it off for much less than it's worth to buy votes.  Given that that is inevitable, I for one don't want me tax money squandered building houses that will just be given away for free come the run up to the 2020 election.

So we have to have a private sector system, we have to have one that's bloated and private sector landlords have to make a profit, not because it's the best way of doing it but because vested interests preclude all the other ways.  Some private landlords are slumlords, others are just trying to make a return on investment.  But neither group can really be blamed IMHO, they're like the spectators in a game of political football.

Edit:  I guess I'm saying that Private Landlords are like ticketmaster:  they take all the bad press for the shitty charges but in reality, it's the venues that are the problem, they're happy to have a shitty expensive service because they make a profit from it being so bad.",null,0,null,1430489373,null,0,1430491383,0,cqv0214,null,t3_34hwnl,null,t1_cqv0214,null,t1_cquxgjv,null,null,null,1432712552,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Obviously, replace Depay for any other goal scoring winger we can find if we cant get him, like Konoplyanka or Yarmolenko. The other winger can be either Sterling / Markovic / Ibe. I don't like having two of those three in the starting lineup because I don't think they currently have a consistent end product. I prefer Coutinho in a CM / AM position behind the striker and it would be a lot stronger against teams that park the bus. But against stronger opposition he'd have to be part of a more compact midfield 3. If we play a more defensive lineup then you could easily just sub on Lucas (or new DM) for Coutinho and play a midfield three of Henderson / Can / Lucas which would be pretty solid but that basically means you are extremely reliant on the front three for goals. We have done that with Allen / Lucas / Henderson a few times but the problem is with a front three of any of the following: Coutinho / Sterling / Markovic / Ibe / Lallana (of whom have been available) we don't score goals (which is why we need a winger who's actually a threat).

Lukaku, Naismith, Miralles and even Osman always seem to have good games against us. When they are on a roll they really are an impressive football team and they are currently on their best run this season. 


I think there are weaknesses there. They take a few risks at the back, Stones in particular is guilty of a few lapses in concentration. You'd fancy Benteke against either one of the centrebacks. We really have to pin their fullbacks back as Coleman is fantastic and Baines is pretty decent going forward. 


Lennon vs Richardson is a worrying battle, Lennon was excellent and ran the game against Burnley and decent against Man Utd. Because Coleman is always raiding down the left he isn't afraid to drift off into space. The three behind the striker can all swap about and be very difficult to pick up. 


As for Guzan/Given i would personally keep Guzan, i think taking him out could destroy the guy and he might use last week as inspiration to have a worldie, which we all know he is capable of. That said, if he were to pick Given I would understand.



Grealish vs Barkley is very interesting. Not a huge fan of Ross Barkley, I think he has a bit of everything and closer to what he will eventually end up being, but incredibly selfish, he likes to have far too many touches of the ball which hurts a lot when they counter. Grealish on the other hand, needs to be a bit more greedy at times. Not saying he should run the pitch every time he gets the ball, but sometimes he passes up the chance to shoot.

null,false,rodismycopilot,null,null,null,"&gt; That is only because we can pay our debt in our currency. Sure, we can do that today, but if the economy really tanked, we would have to pay in a stable currency. 

I disagree.  If the UK economy tanked,  it would not lead to the UK borrowing in a different currency.  The UK would still owe debt denominated in pound sterling.

&gt; If we just printed more money, the inflation, the drop in value of our own currency would result in us having to borrow in foreign

I disagree here as well.  If the UK pound sterling were to lose value, it does not necessarily follow that the UK government would need to borrow in foreign currencies.

&gt; you can see this happen when countries like Argentina tried to peg their currency value to appease the debt holders.

The UK would never be forced into pegging its currency value to appease anyone. Argentina CHOSE to peg its currency to the dollar, which ended up being a disaster.  It was never forced to do so.

&gt; This is very important distinction, because comparing us to say Japan, we rely a lot on international [1], rather than domestic bond/gilt holders.

IMO this is a misunderstanding of the motivations of the foreign debtholders.  They do not hold pound sterling assets as a favor to the UK,  they are not ""lending"" to the UK.  They are buying UK currency assets in order to stabilize their own economies.

If less-developed nations were to stop buying UK or US debt, the less-developed nations' currency values would rise in relation to the pound (or dollar),  their export sectors would become unprofitable,  leading to unemployment, instability, and unrest.

And what if he does not get a top 4 next year. Do we fire him and let another manager come in and buy his own set of players ?.

I like most of Transfer committee's signings. Moreno, Markovic, Can all seem to be their signings. I still think Coutinho is TCs signing. The main problem is Balotelli . There are lot of  BRs preferred signings (Borini, Lambert, Lovren etc )  that have failed too. I also think we need a better midfielder than Allen. Most of the great teams are built with good midfield.

And I also don't understand Bony / Sanchez thing. Sanchez decided that he wont come. So its not TCs failure. Regarding Bony, I am not sure he would fit the style BR wanted to play this season. He is again a target man sort of player. 

The reason our team was successful last year was because Suarez was nearly un-markable. And replacing him with Bony and trying to play same football was not going to succeed. We have tried to play same football with Balotelli, Lambert and even with Sturridge as Lone striker.
Last year Lambert played well. Because he was a target man bringing other midfielders into play for Southampton. This year, he has to run channels. 

So after the long rant, I think the best thing would be that BR starts working with players he has and uses system that suits them. Rather than trying to make players play the system, that could have succeeded only with Suarez in that godly form.

Last year even though we got second, we got that by scoring more goals than others. We would get dominated in mid-field but suddenly Suarez will score some goals or create a goal out of nothing and then we just counter attack and finish the teams off. So without some striker in that Godly form, last years system was never going to succeed this year.

People who aren't employed or at university won't have needed ID. These are the kind of people (poor people) less likely to have ID in the first place, and gaining access to ID can be expensive. A passport costs Â£72.50, no matter how little you earn, and you sometimes need a reference from a 'countersignatory' - someone not in your family, who has known you for more than two years, who is in a recognised profession or be âa person of good standing in their communityâ. 

I managed to pay the cost alright - my parents covered it - finding someone to countersign was more difficult. I ended up having to ask my aunt's spouse, who I get on very poorly with. But many people will struggle at the first hurdle. Â£72.50 is a lot of money if you're unemployed, and unobtainable if you've been sanctioned by the job centre.

Any washing machines are very different to an electricity grid. If there is a trip in Spain, there aren't any reserves in Spain to restore the system. There will be, but that will take time causing severe imbalances in the grid, which cost money. If Poland has excess, the energy is transfered straight across Europe. It's an on paper movement. The energy would come from across the border in France, but would be ""knocked on"" from Poland to ensure the grid is balanced across the whole continent. Poland's actual physical energy reserves don't move very far.

Yes, EU Funding. Of course it comes from taxes. So what if it contributes to building a HVDC cable from GB to Belgium? Most of the fund would come from the National Grid (a private company) and from the Belgian equivalent. It is being built for the benefit of the end consumer, to reduce energy bills, so why should some of that come from EU funding (or taxes, as you say).

Yes, HVDC cables have loses. The BritNed cable (GB to NL) is 260km and looses 3%, so your numbers are bit off. The NorNed cable is 580km and is the longest submarine power cable in the world and has losses of 3.7%. National Grid has just signed an agreement with Stattnet to invest in a cable between GB and Norway, which will become the longest submarine cable in the world. IT wouldn't have gone ahead if the losses were untenable and it wasn't financially viable.

Again, if these investments are for the benefit of consumers, why shouldn't it receive EU funding?

I didn't ""conveniently omit"" anything. I said that the European Union would contribute to a billion pound bill of private investment.

Mostly because he's our manager, and we might as well give him a chance and back him before starting the cycle again.
But also because he's shown signs of potential greatness.
I guess it's like signing a player - there are no guarantees that they'll be great, but you analyse skill sets and see if you think there'll be a good fit.

Before that, we also struggled in big games to hold onto leads - City, United, and PSG away - although I'm buoyed a little by our recent performances against United and Arsenal.

I doubt, in the conceivable future, that we'll ever surpass the likes of Barca/Bayern/Real man for man, so our ability to win in Europe will depend largely on the ability to grind out results, as Mourinho's Porto and Inter did in the past, and as we did in 2012. 

Obviously, the question now is whether or not this team can develop that mental fortitude, and it's still too early to tell: there won't be a real answer until next year.

&gt;

&gt;The __Voynich manuscript__ is an illustrated [codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex) hand-written in an unknown [writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system). The vellum in the book pages has been [carbon-dated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-dated) to the early 15th century (1404â1438), and may have been composed in [Northern Italy during the Italian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance#Northern_and_Central_Italy_in_the_Late_Middle_Ages).   The manuscript is named after [Wilfrid Voynich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfrid_Michael_Voynich), a Polish book dealer who purchased it in 1912. 

&gt;The pages of the codex are [vellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellum). Some of the pages are missing, but about 240 remain. The text is written from left to right, and most of the pages have illustrations or diagrams.

&gt;The Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur [cryptographers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographer), including American and British [codebreakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebreakers) from both [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II).  No one has yet succeeded in deciphering the text, and it has become a famous case in the [history of cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cryptography). The mystery of the meaning and origin of the manuscript has excited the popular imagination, making the manuscript the subject of novels and speculation. None of the many hypotheses proposed over the last hundred years has yet been independently verified.

null,false,domalino,1972crest,,null,"I cannot disagree more. Pellegrini has shown an affinity for Young players his entire career - he's literally famous for it, and that's why we got him. If he's not bringing through youth it's not because he doesn't like them suddenly after 20 years of the opposite. Isco, Cazorla, Rossi, Diego Godin - These are all players who Pellegrini built his teams around when they were 18-21.

The simple fact is we didn't have a single youth player ready for the first team in August. At the time I wanted to see Lopes play, but seeing how well he has done at Lille from regular first team football you can see Pellegrini was correct. This season he tried to play Pozo in the team before going with Milner up front. If he was averse to using youth players he'd have gone straight to Milner up front.

Im pretty confident next season Denayer and Lopes will play and suddenly anyone who thinks he doesn't like youth will be proven wrong.

The reason we have an old squad is because of short term players like Wright, Demichelis, Sagna, Lampard who have been brought in to play for a couple of years until the youth players are ready. Sherwood had the luxury of not needing to finish better than 5th, and his team was average, so a couple of bright kids wasn't a risk. Even then, Kane didn't get a chance until he was 21 - 3 years older than Iheanacho is now, 2 years older than Lopes.

At lower teams, the gap between youth and the main squad is less than the gap of talent that City has, so the youth elsewhere will get more chances. Man United's defense is severely lacking and their strikers underperformed earlier in the season which is why youth have gotten chances there. Notice how Januzaj hasn't got many a chance nowadays? The wings don't  have a lack of performing players, so he hasn't been able to play.  Anyway, our best youth players are on loan: Ronny, Denayer, and Rekik. Not to mention Nacho has only just obtained a work permit. 

I would have said Zuculini before the season, but he has been struggling in La Liga. I think not playing for half a season and then playing at a relegation side, hasn't been good for him. He should have went to Villareal or a club at a midtable level, instead he went to a top 4 side in Valencia and a relegation team where he'll be forced to play under a lot of pressure and without a good/positive style of play (I am just assuming this since they haven't  won a game in a long time).

You can't just turn up in the country and expect to move there, you need to wait in line (and usually pay) for a visa to get permission. So obviously there were Brits in continental Europe before (were there as many as today?) but they would have faced significantly more hurdles on the way without EU free-movement laws. They would not have had an *automatic* right to residency in most European countries by virtue of their existing citizenship of an EU member state. Even in today's world, that's a pretty unusual thing.

So if they suddenly ended free movement for British nationals, what effect would that have on most expats (those who didn't get citizenship in their host countries)? Probably not a very good effect. They would need to apply for some kind of residential status, which would probably not be guaranteed, and could involve all kinds of restrictions. It's irrelevant that in the 1970s you could move to other European countries (obviously I don't dispute that); the legal procedures would have been different then (and probably much more complicated), which is the point.

It's also different from the 1970s in that, with the Schengen area and related reforms to EU internal and external migration policy, the EU's external borders have got even harder to cross. Internal borders (e.g. France/Italy) can also be a problem for those without EU citizenship, while they are practically invisible to us now. Even though we're not in Schengen, we can still cross into it easily as an EU member state; leaving (assuming we go all the way and leave the EEA) would put us in much the same situation as Russia (albeit with more bilateral agreements and better relations with mainland Europe).

[This article](http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/what-happens-to-british-expatriates-if.html) summarises the arguments that I've been making. It's really such a different legal situation from what existed before all the EU treaties that talking about what Brits could do 30 or 40 years ago (before even Maastricht) is just irrelevant. The point is not that Brits would become unable to live in mainland Europe (obviously, people would be able to migrate under whatever arrangements came into place after Brexit); it's that those British citizens who have *already* migrated under EU law would not, in general, retain their residency rights if the system that gave them those rights no longer applied.",null,0,null,1430494355,null,0,1430496111,0,cqv2xe1,null,t3_34edl1,null,t1_cqv2xe1,null,t1_cqv1d5l,null,null,null,1432713973,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,ChaBeezy,english,Cheshire,null,"&gt;1) The welfare bill is not large because of ""people leaving home at 18 to claim benefits"". 47% of the welfare bill is spent on state pensions. Only 3% is spent on Jobseekers' Allowance. There are, in fact, two areas of growing spending: housing benefit, and working tax credits.
To resolve working tax credits, a higher minimum wage is required. This is because, at the moment, these benefits fill in the gap between exploitative low wages and effective pay, simply to save employers money.
To resolve housing benefit, building more social housing is required. This is because, due to the lack of social housing, the government must instead pay rent directly to private landlords. Private landlords currently pocket around 40% of housing benefit. For example, a Tory MP, Richard Benyon, receives more than Â£625,000 a year from housing benefit alone.
This is how you truly tackle the welfare bill, and help the economy and British people at the same time. Not by scapegoating an underclass, demonising the poor, and using isolated incidents as justification for entirely unfair and inefficient regimes.


You've account for just 50% of welfare spending there. So people leaving home at 18 to claim benefits can still be claiming child tax credits, housing benefits, council tax relief, etc. Don't just get your news from /r/UK. 


&gt;2) It is embarrassing to pretend to care about the NHS by utilising personal experiences, whilst having witnessed a top-down reorganisation which cost the jobs of more than 5,000 nurses, shutting down of A&amp;Es, and the severe slashing of social care.

The NHS needs to be viable, costs will be cut in an attempt to deal with the massive budget it has. The answers are tax everyone more, or cut services. Tories have gone with the latter; we'll see what labour do when they likely come in to power next (I suspect more of the same)

&gt;3) To purport that this has been ""difficult for everyone"" is an outright lie. The 1,000 wealthiest in Britain have seen their wealth double over the past five years. Meanwhile, everyone else has witnessed the biggest decline in real wages since records began. Also, 1 million visited food banks within the past year.
Furthermore, the rich have received massive income and corporate tax cuts during this government, whilst everyone else faced a disproportionate impact under the raise in taxation of goods and services (VAT). This has resulted in a disgustingly regressive tax regime whereby the poorest 10% of households pay more of their income in tax than anyone else. The poorest are literally paying more than the rich in tax.
A regressive tax regime of this kind is a violation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights Article 2. In essence, a breach of human rights law.

Most of this is wrong/ignorant/headlines. 

The 1,000 wealthiest people have seen their wealth double over 10 years because thats exactly what you would expect to happen. Here is a child like website that might help you understand it https://www.mathsisfun.com/money/compound-interest.html

1 million did not visit a foodbank last year. That is a lie; so hardly clarifying factual inaccuracies on your behalf.

The poorest are in no way literally paying more than the rich in tax. In fact minimum earns practically pay no income tax at all.


&gt;4) ""2 million new jobs"" is a vague and misleading phrase. It neither connotes the reality that many of these jobs are temporary, nor that they are usually underpaid. Also, due to huge public sector cuts, many of those previously well-employed, will now be settling for far less security in their employment.

Vague and misleading phrase followed up by subjecture based on nothing on your behalf...much better! Back this statement up with something rather than just spout it for us to accept. After all you are clarifying factual errors here. 

After all, the latest reports show employment is at the highest it has ever been and wages are currently rising faster than inflation.

&gt;5) Repeatedly asserting that we now have ""a strong economy"" whilst slandering previous Labour spending, is politically dishonest and economically questionable.
Economists have described this as Britain's slowest economic growth in history. In fact, even that growth has halved during the first quarter of 2015. This means that the slowest economic growth in history, just got slower. This is no surprise given the severe cuts, lack of disposable income, and repression in wages. If you deprive the economy of all stimulus except for the richest 1%, the illusory figures represented will undoubtedly crumble too.
Furthermore, the Conservatives had planned to match Labour's spending pound for pound until 2008. At one point, they promised to spend more. Hence, retrospectively implicating Labour's spending plans whilst ignoring the very same view taken by your own party, is no presentation of a better alternative at all.

We have a strong economy by almost every traditional measure of an economy. GDP is going up, low interest rates, low employment, rising wages. Again, if you are planning to clarify facts bring some as opposed to opinion and anecdotes. 

&gt;6) To imply you want a ""more accountable government"" after curtailing judicial review, cutting legal aid in areas of public law, and levying court fees to prevent access to justice, is laughable at the least. And a display of sad indifference and deliberate dishonesty at best.

It might be a boon for people wanting to buy their first place but anyone in social housing will be evicted within 6 months and everyone else will be pissy their house suddenly dropped in value.  

Then interest rates will go up (as prices fell so banks can no longer get their money back by reprocessing).  So everyone with a mortgage will suddenly get a lot poorer.  Remember when we spend almost a trillion pounds bailing out banks *specifically to stop interest rates rising*?  If you were PM and you implemented this, you'd be lynched by your own MPs before lunchtime.

Everyone wants to spend less on housing but no one will stop and think just 5 minutes ahead.  Like anything else in politics and economics, the housing market is complex and you can't just throw ~~wrenches~~ spanners at it in the hope it will suddenly work better.

I still think we'll sign about 4 players this summer, and possibly add a couple of our loans to that (Elia I imagine will stay, and although he's not done much I think Djuricic could come good, though hope he wouldn't end up a Ramirez).

I'd really like to see all those you mentioned get more game time. Especially the strikers though, we've not brought through any strikers since Best/McGlodrick (I think).

Already addressed this point.

&gt; Very large and widening wealth inequality

This is somewhat due to the very nature of capitalism. However capitalism for all its faults has also lifted more people from poverty than anything else in history. It's also true that until the recession the poor were getting richer and living standards were rising for all, just more slowly than the poor than the rich. This is in direct contrast to the 60s/70s in the UK, when inequality was more tightly controlled, strangling incentive and we were all getting poorer on the world stage. Ultimately it comes down to incentive vs societal fairness, and the extent to which capitalism can be controlled without breaking it.

&gt;3) Proven loss of GDP growth due to austerity

This is a misnomer. GDP is everything brought+sold in the economy. So if the government doesn't buy as much, of course that will cause a loss of GDP! But as communism proved the public sector cannot drive long term economic growth, it must come from private enterprise. And so if over the long term the governments decrease in spending has prompted increased spending by the private sector (which it has), then that is a good thing.

&gt; 4) 1 million people using food banks despite low unemployment

Neither here nor there from an macroeconomic perspective, this is more microeconomics. The macroeconomic side to this would be that productivity has slumped since the recession, which has led to poor average pay increases. Spending on infrastructure and education are the long term solutions to this, so I do agree that we should spend more on infrastructure... just not by taking on more debt.

&gt; 5) Very low GDP growth. You seem to think we are in the 'good times'. We are not, growth has not been above 2% since 2008.

We grew at 2.6% last year, and 1.9% in 2013. Growth is forecast to be above 2% this year too, FWIW. Average growth in advanced economies is only around 2-2.5% a year, so right now growth must be considered pretty good. Sustained 3-4% growth is not achievable for such an advanced economy as ours.",null,0,null,1430496166,null,0,false,0,cqv41pe,null,t3_34g9wj,null,t1_cqv41pe,null,t1_cqv3463,null,null,null,1432714501,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

They wouldn't be stateless, since they would retain their British citizenship, obviously. But that citizenship would no longer give them the right of residency in Spain (say). Is that really so hard to understand?

The evidence is really simple: their automatic right to reside in Spain with UK citizenship is tied to the UK's membership of the EU. Absent that, there is no automatic right. As non-EU citizens resident in the EU they would likely face an uphill struggle to reclaim *some* of the rights they had before.

The UK and Ireland have a separate free-travel area with bilateral agreements. It is possible that such a free-travel area could exist between the UK and EU, but that is unlikely from both sides. They'll say that Europe is not a free lunch, and we have enough people here who don't want to give everyone in Eastern Europe the right to live here. It's possible that an individual EU member (say Spain) could make such a bilateral agreement with the UK, but hardly guaranteed.

If you want another example, Australia's free-travel arrangement with New Zealand was altered several years ago, so that NZ expats in Australia no longer go onto the citizenship track automatically. That had quite a large effect on the community of NZ expats who were already there; you can't imply that just because our own expats already there (e.g. Brits in Spain), they can't be affected by subsequent changes in immigration law. I assure you that if you're living in a country where you're not a citizen, changes in its policies towards migrants can have a major effect on you. Think about other stuff: what about your family members? Can they join you? Do you need to sponsor them for a separate visa? What are the limitations on that? Even today in non-EU Europe, Switzerland has recently tightened up its restrictions on foreign workers. This appearance that we live in a Europe where ""anyone can live anywhere"" persists *because of the EU*.

&gt;You've got this notion that pre free movement legislation that Brits had arduous hurdles that kept us at home. We didn't, we worked all over Europe.

Were there as many as two million, including lots of pensioners? Did they have an automatic right to live and work in those countries? I don't know if visa processes are really ""arduous hurdles"" but they are a legal obstacle. *Obviously* (and you seem not to get this) I am aware that people were able to go through such processes to get residency in other countries in the past. The question is what happens to those people who *do not* have specific legal permission from the government of their host country (such as a permanent residency visa) because they never needed one?

&gt;You also have this notion that Brits would somehow be stateless or forced out of Europe. There's no evidence to support it.

My argument is not that Spain and France would immediately start expelling legions of British expats, it's that many of these people would lose the legal status that automatically allows them to stay there. They would face deep uncertainty about their future, and there's no evidence that any legal agreement which could assuage that would be forthcoming.",null,0,null,1430497286,null,0,1430497787,0,cqv4qtx,null,t3_34edl1,null,t1_cqv4qtx,null,t1_cqv3yr4,null,null,null,1432714830,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; Q. Why do you need to write my elector number beside my ballot paper number? Does this mean my vote is not secret?

&gt; A. The requirement that the elector number is recorded on this list against the number of the ballot paper issued to you is included in the election rules. This system is essentially an updated version of a system that dates from the Ballot Act 1872, which was introduced to avoid the possibility of counterfeit ballot papers being used and to assist with the detection of alleged fraud.


&gt; Clearly, if the ballot papers are numbered, it is far more difficult for an unscrupulous person to introduce copies of official ballot papers into the ballot box. If a fraudulent act has occurred, it would be possible to detect the offence by reference to the corresponding number list. There is a safeguard to prevent the ballot paper numbers on the corresponding number list being linked with the marked ballot papers. At the close of poll, the corresponding number list is placed in a sealed envelope by the Presiding Officer at the polling station. The sealed envelope is then taken to the Local Returning Officer. After the count has taken place, the used ballot papers are also sealed. The only occasion when the sealed packets can be opened is on the order of a judge as a result of an election petition or in furtherance of an investigation into an alleged election offence. Even then, it is very rare for the documents to be examined except in cases where fraud or personation (i.e. someone voting illegally on someone elseâs behalf) are being investigated.

&gt; Because of the above safeguards, it is virtually impossible for any person to be in a position to marry up the voter to a particular ballot paper. For that reason, voters can be confident that the ballot remains secret. Voters have no grounds to fear that the way in which they voted could be detected, except under the very special circumstances outlined above.

I'm also hoping it doesn't become a president that we buy the unwanted players of other premier league clubs. Martinez hasn't been too narrow sighted with his choice of transfers so far but we'll never find the next Coleman by buying off Spurs.

He seems like a safe bet right now but I worry that signing him would be nearly as much of a gamble as signing someone who's new to us. If he played with the same intensity and positive attitude next season I'd be very happy but only time will tell.

That said, we will most likely need 2 new wingers in the summer so he could prove to be a solid choice for one of them.",null,0,null,1430497863,null,0,false,0,cqv53t8,null,t3_34iok5,null,t1_cqv53t8,null,t1_cqv0wd2,null,null,null,1432715000,null,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5,null

What are we letting happen, as fans, by letting the club legitimise MK in a sense? Because if we go and play there, that's what we do by association. 

It's 100% a no from me. I don't want to be associated with that as a Spurs fan. If we are against the possibility of Spurs being relocated and our identity being changed and the club being stolen from our fans, then it is our responsibility to say no to MK.

Long version: This was on the day of the solar eclipse earlier this year. People had posted pictures of grey clouds or nothing at all - cracking jokes about not being able to see the eclipse. 

I *could* see the eclipse, took a couple of photos I was pleased with and wanted to share them. This thing only comes along once every X years so why not? 

So I posted my shot.. which didn't appear in the post rankings at all. A few hours posted and still nothing. 

So when I got home later that day I sent off a mod report and heard back from /user/beard-maketh-the-man that my submission was stuck in a filter but - as we already had pictures of grey skies and so on - he wasn't allowing it through and deleted it manually instead on the premise we had too many posts about the eclipse already. 

Not to blow my trumpet but my shot was actually worth sharing and (I think) of interest... unlike a picture of some grey clouds.

So I kicked back and pointed out there were few worthwhile shots of the eclipse and more pictures of irrelevant stuff. Also that we also get plenty of duplicate threads on politics and many other matters - so why not this one off event? 

He never replied. 

I seldom posts threads at the best of times but that pretty much killed off my desire to interact on here too much. What's the point if you do put effort in to something and it's not allowed because some mod made an arbitrary decision on it? 

Also there's nothing on the sidebar to suggest it broke posting rules, so they can't use that on me either.

1. There are over 30 places named Aberdeen throughout the world.

2. Aberdeen Harbour Board, established in 1136, is Britain's oldest business.

3. In 1808 the entire fishing village of Footdee (Fittie) was moved partly to accommodate harbour expansion and partly because the residents had requested it.


5. The Shore Porters Society of Aberdeen was founded in 1498. Still trading today, it is the world's oldest documented transport company.

6. Union Street is named to commemorate the Union of Britain and Ireland.

7. More medieval coin hoards have been found in Aberdeen than anywhere else in Britain.

8. The Kirk of St Nicholas houses the largest carillon in Britain, consisting of 48 bells.

9. The Aberdeen Journal, one of the Press and Journal's ancestors, is one of the oldest newspapers in Britain, first printed in 1748.

Sometimes, the rich subsides the poor too much, sometimes it's the other way around (the rich aren't subsiding enough).

The question is, where do we draw line on that?

My answer would be that it should be relative in relation to guaranteeing the same support to those who need it. If the percentage of contribution by the rich is too high, then we're doing something wrong.

Obviously, this means the percentage of contribution by the rich will raise as inequity increases. We should reduce inequity as much as possible. Unfortunately, the society we live in, pretty much guarantees that the rich will get richer.

null,false,Vancha,null,null,null,"Voting helps perpetuate first-past-the-post and thus actively does harm to our democracy by perpetuating a semi-democracy.

If no one participates, there is no voting system. Therefore the credibility of any given voting system scales in relation to the level of participation. If the level of participation is high, it lends the voting system credibility, but if it's low, it hurts the voting systems credibility. It's far easier to argue FPTP should be scrapped if it has a 35% turnout than if it has a 90% turnout.

It's essentially the same idea as voting with your wallet, but with votes. I think most of us recognize that companies are far less receptive to customer complaints until it starts to affect their bottom line. If you threaten to cancel your service, subscription or whatever, most companies will suddenly go ""woah, hang on now, lets not be hasty. Maybe something could be worked out"". Similarly, political parties will keep on keeping on until they start to lose votes. This is the very argument used to justify voting for smaller parties or spoiling your ballot. If they stop getting your votes, they want to win them back and adjust accordingly.

You can apply the same thing to the voting system. If you continue to plug votes in, it has very little reason to change. You're doing what it requires to succeed. As such, it is nigh-impossible to vote in a way that will harm first past the post more than it will help it, because merely participating helps prop it up more than it contributes to tearing it down. There is one exception which is specific to FPTP however and that's hung parliaments. If you're in a contested seat and you can help someone win that makes a hung parliament more likely, you should absolutely do so (according to current polls, reducing tory seats seems to be desirable to that end). This is because FPTP aims to avoid hung parliaments and thus they damage its credibility along with low turnout. Additionally, if you're in a seat where a pro-reform party has a real chance of winning (Greens in Brighton, for example), then voting may do more good than harm.

So in an ideal world, you spread cover as per requirements. City centres and large towns get ambulance stations, and more ambulances on standby. Smaller towns get an ambulance and a caron stand by, and then as you get out to the villages you get a car covering a few villages/ couple of towns who can call back up if you need it.

Now unfortunately the ambulance service accounts for like, 45% of 999 calls. We are never not busy. So all these ambulances get calls for patients. They try their best but end up taking most of them to hospital. Now all those ambulances on standby are either at hospital, or covering the calls that are now coming in because the first wave are currently occupied. By a quarter of the way through the shifts all the ambulances have converged on the DGH. You haven't got all those ambulances spread out at this point, but instead converged in Truro. So now you get a call in some god awful arse end of the county, and the ambulance has to travel 40+ miles just to get there  for what probably isn't an emergency, just to take them to hospital and continue the cycle.

Personally, depending on how much is left over after bringing in a striker and CM, I'd like to see if Real Madrid could be tempted to part ways with Dani Carvajal. With Danilo heading there Carvajal is likely to drop down the pecking order, and at 23 you'd hope he would want to be playing somewhere as first choice. Most of the other top teams already seem to be fairly well equipped at right back.

It might be too ambitious, or even delusional, but I think it would be worth a shot before switching efforts to the likes of Janmaat or Byram.

Basic bookkeeping would be easy and your local college probably does evening courses on Sage Line 50. Usually Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. If you're going to have a bookkeeper then you probably want to do none of these, or perhaps Beginner just so you have a basic understanding of how it works. If you'll be doing the books then Beginner and probably Intermediate, depending on how big your business will be - your accountant can do the more fiddly things like year-end accruals and running the year-end routine on the software. 

Financial management may be a bit trickier. I'm assuming you mean both the ability to understand management accounts and also how to manage cash flows, options for financing asset purchases etc. Your accountant might know of something, else hopefully your local college or the Open University will do a short course aimed at entrepreneurs, alternately there may be a good book - the hard part would likely be finding one that is relevant and doesn't start banging on about things like it's a text book for a university, or goes on about mezzanine finance like you're the next Elon Musk.

""He bullies, swears and shrieks, but presents his paper as having the values and standards of a misty Midsomer Britain. Dacre is, all those who have had the misfortune to work for him assure me, just about as loathsome, self-regarding, morally putrid, vengeful and disgusting a man as it possible to be.""

So no, nothing to do with Rupert Murdoch. But the people behind the paper are equally, deeply unpleasant, and have the same loony far-right agenda.

Although irrefutable evidence of electoral fraud in Northern Ireland has not been produced, public opinion surveys have revealed that the majority of the population considered fraud to be a widespread and significant problem.

Furthermore, if electors perceive fraud to be rife, and sufficient to change the outcome of elections, this is likely to undermine their confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.

BR got a chance to sign established players like Lallana, Lambert and Lovren that were supposed to fit right into the side this season. Obviously that didn't work out too well. If the season was a mess, it's certainly more due to this group of players not performing than any other reason. Lack of a striker was a serious problem, but the team has also lacked cohesion, strength and defensive stability all season. 

Sakho, Coutinho, Sturridge and Mignolet are clearly our best players along with Lucas, Skrtel, Sterling and Henderson.
