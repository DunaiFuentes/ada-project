They don't. They're being moved on and the relevant departments have been notified.

&gt;They are either begging or stealing to survive in our country (they are unlikely to get employed with no address or clean clothes), when they get ill they will be using are health services and when they do stuff like this its using are money to deal with it. 

'Are' money should be used to police the UK and provide healthcare for its inhabitants, which includes taking care of the homeless populace. If they're here illegally then that should be dealt with. Whether they're illegally within the UK or not it's of no benefit to Britain to have a bunch of sick, homeless foreigners lining our prison cells and detention centres. Again, I'm not saying we're responsible for them, but we have a duty to treat them like human beings until we can establish whether they are to be deported or not.

&gt;If it was someone from the UK doing the same in their country I'd put money on they would be robbed of everything, thrown in jail or worse

I've never really liked this argument. It's almost akin to ""well, they get away with it so why shouldn't we?"". I like to think better of the UK in its treatment of people, and while we can't say that our policing is perfect or that the government treats its own citizens well, I think it's always important to expect humane treatment from what we consider to be a civilized society.

null,false,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,null,"&gt; Yes, there's absolutely no system on earth designed for handling 'leap hours'... except Daylight Savings

Daylight savings isn't the same as leap hours.

Daylight savings happen in timezones, which are just an offset from UTC. Anything that doesn't want to deal with timezones (like a computer) can just think in UTC all the time and whenever it needs to make a date or a time meaningful to a human it can use that human's timezone to figure out their local time. 

So the UK spends half the time at UTC+0 and summertime at UTC+1. When the clocks go forward a computer basically notes that from some particular point it needs to add an hour to times when it displays time information for humans. When they go back it notes that it can stop doing that. Crucially, though, that computer never enters daylight savings time in any capacity other than by modifying how it translates times. A computer in France, similarly, thinks in UTC and displays dates and times in UTC+1 or UTC+2 depending on whether it's summertime or not.

Computers having problems with this boils down to the idea that if they wait for one second then they expect that only one second has elapsed. Quite a large amount of software assumes this. The problem with leap-seconds is that it's possible for a computer to wait for one second and find that a second hasn't yet passed, or that two have (depending on how it implements the 'wait').",null,0,null,1435677354,null,0,false,0,csnle62,null,t3_3bm0w9,null,t1_csnle62,null,t1_csngjht,null,null,null,1437464443,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

From your description, and a quick scan, MMPR actually sounds a lot like the (much more vague) idea I had in my head about how things might work, though yes I had realised that there could be problems similar to those you mentioned. The potential issues created when MPs are pushed into seats unvoted in particular is something I'd internally hand-waved as ""probably fixable given a little thought""... But I don't know.

And whilst you're right that it can be proven that no voting system can be perfect by every reasonable metric, I think we can probably find a number of examples which are objectively better than the *current* system by (almost?) every reasonable metric ;)... This might not make the correct ultimate decision obvious, but I do think the fact that we need to change is a no-brainer at least.

I think unfortunately a lot of people will probably expect the ""fairness"" of a voting system to be something they can intuit without a proper thorough understanding, so it would be a difficult conversation to have nationally in such a way that everyone can make informed contributions and decisions.

That doesn't match my experience.  Exemption certificates (and Class 2 NI in general) were entirely separate from SA.  You got a certificate by filling in a form CF10 (or latterly via an online application).  You claimed the exemption in advance.  If you registered as self-employed but didn't claim the exemption HMRC would start billing you for Class 2 NI.  

&gt; If so, am I right to assume that the ones covering Apr 2014 &gt; Apr 2015 would have been sent out a good while ago?

AFAIK any certificate would have been sent out in response to an application from you, which could have been made at any time.  AIUI you have found a certificate which ran out in 2013.  You should then have reapplied to get a new certificate.  If you didn't then you may simply not have had a certificate since 2013 and HMRC haven't noticed they should've been charging you Class 2 NI.

&gt; is there somewhere I can request a copy of them, as this is the period that HB wants the certs for.

I'd ask the Self Employed NI line.

* A £600m next phase of the Metro integrated transport network for South Wales will be confirmed today by Welsh Government Minister Edwina Hart.

* This will include addressing the key question of what form of transport will be used on the Valley Lines, as well as the type of not for profit company that will take forward delivery of the Metro, alongside the Wales &amp; Borders Rail franchise, which is being devolved from 2018.

* Mrs Hart is also expected to reference Transport for London, which has responsibility for the London Underground, bus regulation and increasingly elements of the capital’s heavy rail infrastructure, as a model to aspire to.

* The Welsh Government has deliberately not explicitly set out the form of transport, which are light rail [tram] or heavy rail, it would like to see operate on the various Valley Lines into Cardiff – or indeed a combination of the two. Consideration will also be given to aligning bus services to Metro services.

* “Metro aspires for at least four services per hour at the network periphery, increasing over time as demand dictates.” Currently from locations such as Aberdare and Merthyr there are only between one to two services per hour into Cardiff – taking at least an hour.

* A tram service could reduce journey times from Merthyr to Cardiff by around 20 minutes and with a service of one every 15.",null,0,null,1435679500,null,0,false,0,csnms14,null,t3_3bn56f,null,t1_csnms14,null,t3_3bn56f,null,null,null,1437465245,null,9,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,9,null

I have to say though, your last three refutations of Benteke's passing, pressing and his role as a target man are really just you saying ""no, he's not."" I understand that Lambert's tactics are responsible for a decent amount of how he played, but has he shown himself to consistently be able to press well, or pass? Has he played a season as a non-target man in a top league? I think whether or not Benteke has it in him to fit BR's style is very interesting, and I think that argument would be quite a bit more split than the ones you usually see on this sub regarding him. But the fact remains that he hasn't done those things yet. Whether down to Lambert or not, it's impossible to definitively say, as Benteke hasn't shown he can effectively do what is needed from him under BR.

My point was if you don't like people doing this in your country why do it in others.

If the government of the country doesn't listen to the people and its in such a bad way then it shouldn't have been allowed in the EU.

When the clocks go forward a computer basically notes that from some particular point it needs to add an hour to times when it displays time information for humans. When they go back it notes that it can stop doing that. Crucially, though, that computer never enters daylight savings time in any capacity other than by modifying how it translates times. A computer in France, similarly, thinks in UTC and displays dates and times in UTC+1 or UTC+2 depending on whether it's summertime or not.

While this is true for sensible OSes (read: *nixes) windows will, in fact, change your hardware clock by an hour for daylight changes unless you use an unsupported registry hack which apparently was disabled for windows 8 (I haven't tried it there so I could be wrong).

My worry is, if we remove that consideration, we are likely to ignore those inherant traits, and consider anyone who acts differently, or 'badly' has something wrong with them, as opposed to it being a symptom of their different bioligical traits. 

I have the opinion that boys and girls learn differently, although i have not done much research  on it, and clearly you are in a better position than me to know, but perhaps what you are seeing when you mention the male teachers, is a manifestation of that trait that the geneders learn in different ways. Perhaps those boys are getting something more out of the classroom with a male teacher in it, and that is has less to do with how they discipline, and more to do with how they teach? 

I know correlation doesnt mean causation, but perhaps the fact the vast majority of primary school teachers are women, and boys are falling behind in school, is a symptom of them not getting the right kind of discipline and education from their female teachers. 

This is NOT to say that female teachers are bad, quite the opposite, but there's a reason why having a mother and father at home as poopsed to a single parent generally means the child will turn out more mentally stable. It seems to me that both a male and female influence is needed in our schooling system for children to thrive.

The solution is, therefore, in my opinion, to work to remove gendering of traits so that everyone can be how they want to be. That doesn't mean everyone will be the same, but that their differences won't be tied to gender.

Well, if that were true, the girls wouldn't be better behaved too, would they? It's most definitely not to do with how they discipline, it's to do with the stereotypes we all have about men and women.

There's been vast amounts of research that demonstrate unequivocally that all teachers (men and women) have higher behavioural standards for girls and let boys get away with more. There is a widely held theory that the reason boys struggle is that they are not disciplined in the way girls are. In not disciplining them, in not getting them into good habits, we're contributing to their lack of success in other words.

Uhhh, children with **two** parental figures tend to have better lives. Children with stable financial families tend to have better lives. Children with lots of attention at home tend to have better lives. There's lots of reasons why children from single mother families have a harder time and the lack of a male figure is only one, quite small one. The fact that they're more likely to be poor and/or financially unstable, the fact that they're more likely to have lots of time with adults, lots of help with homework, lots of after-school activites, the fact that their parent is more likely to be stressed and there's likely to be less breathing room between parent and child.

He faced **74 spots kicks**, 32 of which came in shoot-outs, **saved 14** and forced opponent into missing the target 5 more times. 

Here are his 14 penalty saves, by chronogolical order :

Railcards could be held electronically, and the conductor could just (theoretically) breeze through the train bleeping tickets along the way.  Customers could print them out if they wish, and barriers could have scanners like they do in airport check-in, which work with phone screens or paper.  Hell, even the traditional ticket offices could move to printing the same codes, and using the same e-platform, and just provide an interface for the customers who aren't tech savvy.

That'd be great - no having to go and collect your tickets from the machine, as it is now.

BUDGET:

- Run surpluses in good times. Need to be trusted with people's money.
- Echoing the social democratic policies of Blair - a strong private sector vital to provide revenue for public services.

ECONOMY:

- Need a high-wage economy.
- Echoing Harold Wilson's 'White Heat' speech - embrace technology for the future of our economy.
- Inequality: 'New Labour was sometimes too cavalier' about people being left behind.
- Give low-pay commission more powers to help shift industries to living wage level.
- Worker representation on company boards.

TRAINING:

- Co-operate with unions and business to focus on apprenticeships and on-the-job training, rather than just school qualifications - possibly through individual learning accounts.

BANKING:

- Reform banking system so business can get the investment it needs. Look into local banking, innovative funding methods - e.g. crowdfunding.

DEVOLUTION:

- Shifting power from central government to local level. More powers for cities.
- Cities/towns/counties can innovate with jobs programmes etc rather than relying on Westminster gov.
- More money into local gov. coffers rather than central.

I think she's finally managed to spell out that she *does* have a vision. I became very sceptical of her over the past few weeks, but I'm now of the opinion that she's probably the candidate with the most exciting vision for the future of the party. A lot of this stuff will need work, and it'll need to be translated into concrete policy terms - but there's time for that. My concern would be that it would be quite easy for the Tories to ape the rhetoric of things like devolution, and they're already doing this on topics like promising a 'high-wage economy'.",null,0,null,1435683623,null,0,false,0,csnpigr,null,t3_3bm9wz,null,t1_csnpigr,null,t3_3bm9wz,null,null,null,1437467097,null,6,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,6,null

- Keith Lemon is not widely liked
- The advert is set in japan for no reason other than a very weak joke about Keith Lemon wanting to go on holiday
- Keith Lemon talks like he's got a mouth full of marbles so you really can't understand what he's saying if you're only half paying attention (as you normally do during adverts)
- The major take away from the advert is ""wow, Japan looks like a nice place to visit"" which is clearly not its intent.
- It is never explained what this product/service actually does or how you use it
- He carries around a tablet with him so I assume it's a tablet app but this is never explicitly stated
- At the end you find out it's a product by the carphone warehouse but this just adds to the confusion.

To me I identify more as Northern Irish rather than Irish (yes northern Ireland is in the island of Ireland) only because I would call people from the Republic Irish and how often do you hear the Republic of Ireland just being referred to as Ireland and Northern Ireland as Northern Ireland?

My outlook on Everton's future is this: I like Martinez, and I think we have some *very* promising young talent. If we show faith in our skipper and can turn in a decent season we'll do well to keep some of this young talent at the club for the long haul. Tides turn.

Not only do students taking the option consistently fare worse in exams, but the part of the CST course that you get is fairly boring mathematically speaking.

The half of the CST course that you would get includes all of the programming (in Java and ML), algorithms and data structures, and numerical methods (i.e. dealing with imperfect precision in calculations). Although the content may be interesting if you've never seen this stuff before, if mathematical rigour is what you're after then you're looking in the wrong place. Instead the difficulty ultimately lies in having to memorise a lot of details for the exam.

Based on what you've said above, the highlight of the first year of the CST would have been Discrete Maths, which covers topics like logic, proof, number theory and set theory. However, unfortunately that's in the half of the course that you don't get to do.

On the other hand, don't let what I've said put you off completely. As I said before, if you've never seen any of this stuff before, then you are still likely to learn some very useful stuff. Just don't go in expecting to hone your logic or mathematical skills.

&gt;

&gt;The Green Bay Packers have the most famous waiting list, with more than 100,000 names. The team's website says the wait is 30 years.  It is a common custom in [Green Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin) and other [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin) cities to put a baby's name on the list as soon as the birth certificate is obtained.    Transfer of standing to surviving relatives is permitted by the Packers.  The Packers front office tell fans the wait will be for 30 years.

&gt;The [Washington Redskins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins) were reported to have the most number of names on their waiting list at over 150,000. However, recent investigations question whether a waiting list exists at all,  which would seem to contradict the fact that [FedExField](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedExField) demolished 10,000 seats heading into the 2011 season. The [New York Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants), [New York Jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets), [Philadelphia Eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles), [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers), [Seattle Seahawks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks) and [Denver Broncos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos) historically have also maintained long waiting lists for season tickets.

this was interesting:  
  
*In a nutshell, his philosophy was this: you’ve got four players in the defensive line and you’ve got the goalkeeper, who at the time was Pepe Reina, who is good with the ball at his feet. You’ve got the two central defenders outside the area and you’ve got one of the central midfielders who can come for the ball. And if he’s marked, the other one can come for it. If you have 30 metres from your goalkeeper to the midfield, if the players are good with the ball at their feet, at most the opposition are going to pressure you with two men.
No one else is going to come. If you can pass it well, if your positioning is good, it is impossible for them to take the ball off you. Why? Because you outnumber them and you will always have a line of pass open which allows you to progress up the pitch. A midfielder drops into the space which the central defenders open out, the goalkeeper becomes an “outfield” player and you carry the ball forward that way. I listened and I was sold. It seemed so simple that way but no one had ever walked me through it like that before. I thought: “He’s right, it is impossible in a 30-metre space, with the players Liverpool have got, with the ability that Pepe Reina has with the ball at his feet, for them to get the ball off us.”*",null,0,null,1435687474,null,0,false,0,csns4zd,null,t3_3bno1o,null,t1_csns4zd,null,t3_3bno1o,null,null,null,1437468805,null,17,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,17,null

&gt; The BBC'S success is not in producing good original content

So Sherlock didn't win 7 Emmys last year (more than anything else), the BBC hasn't won the Rose d'Or more times than anyone else by a very wide margin, it isn't responsible for the most-watched fact. ent. TV show on the planet (*Top Gear*), nor one of the top entertainment shows in the world (*Strictly*), nor the holder of three Guinness World Records (*Doctor Who*)...

&gt; outside of a small number of series copied from national geographic

The BBC Natural History Unit is *the* world leader in wildlife cinematography, and it makes more annual hours of content than anyone else in the world. National Geographic works with the NHU as does Discovery. 

The BBC site has been downsized and the architecture simplified to reduce cost over the past few years.

Yes, many of the top shows on the BBC are decades old. But this is true of most places. Should we not appreciate things that have stood the test of audience taste?

If you really want groundbreaking, the BBC invented radio outside broadcasting. Then it invented *live* radio outside broadcast. Then for the 1948 Olympics, it invented live TV outside broadcast. But along the way it also managed to invent noise-cancelling microphones.

The BBC conducted its first HDTV transmissions in 1982, but of course BBC R&amp;D was a bit more busy with inventing Teletext and closed-captioning and demonstrating it to other broadcasters.

Later in the decade it invented sound-in-sync, which was a more efficient way of getting backend satellite and microwave-uplinked footage back and forth between remote units and studios, and studios and transmission facilities.

It had a role in the development of DAB and NICAM Stereo in the early 90s, and began simulcasting Radio 1 online in 1997. The following year R1 began live webcams from the studios.

Again BBC took a major role in developing the specifications for DVB which replaced PAL on digital switchover (also funded from the licence fee). 

In 2012 it collaborated with NHK on broadcasting live coverage of some Olympic events in 8K UHDTV to audiences in the UK, US and Japan, and participated in 4K IPTV tests from Rio during the world cup.

Currently, the EBU is re-evaluating the technical standards for european broadcasting. Who did they choose to draw up the new specifications? 

The BBC *is* envied throughout the world.

Let's look at the costs of producing high-quality TV.

* The BBC documentary series *Life* cost [~£1m per hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_%28BBC_TV_series%29)
* ['$300,000 on the low end to slightly over a million dollars'](http://www.pbs.org/pov/blog/news/2011/08/how_much_does_it_really_take_to_make_documentary/) [for a documentary] - American documentary director
* Sherlock costs about [£1.1m/hour](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10527620/Sherlock-filming-the-way-Holmes-faked-his-death-for-The-Empty-Hearse.html)
* Game of Thrones costs [$5-10m per hour-long episode](http://www.ibtimes.com/game-thrones-big-budgets-bring-huge-success-how-hbo-series-makes-money-high-cost-episode-1658966)
* Doctor Who costs [~£1m per episode](http://whatculture.com/tv/doctor-10-reasons-bbc-increase-budget.php)

So, we'll make the rather charitable assumption that the BBC can produce unlimited high-quality broadcast material at a rate of £0.5m/hour. If we ask them to fill two channels, twelve hours per day, how much will that cost?

£0.5 million/hour * 12 hour/day * 365 day/year * 2 = £4.38bn/year

Which is basically the entire budget. That doesn't leave much money to provide all the other BBC services that people like, such as:

* Radio (~£650m/year)
* BBC Online (~£200m/year)
* BBC Three (~£120m/year)
* CBBC, CBeebies (~£150m/year)
* BBC News (~£60m/year)

null,false,mr_rivers1,null,null,null,"I'll skip over to your second point. There have been quite a few good studies done on very young children, before any outside influence, which show that females are generally more nurturing, and men are more generally creative. I'm speaking widely here. I think there is a danger behind removing these gendered traits. I think children should have the choice to be creative, or nurturing, or whatever they want to be. If that means boys want to run around in the playground shooting fake guns, and girls want to play with dolls (terrible cliche examples I know, but you get what i mean), they should have the option to, especially at school where learning can be controlled. I think there is as much danger in removing these gendered traits as there is to over fostering them, simply because it stops teachers being able to expand and help with developing the skills related to certain so-called gendered traits. Of course, there are exceptions, but I dont think there's anything wrong with boys wanting to be men, and girls wanting to be women, as long as it's their choice, then nurturing those inherant traits means they will turn out to be better people. Ignoring them might have the opposite effect. 

As for your third point, I dont necessarily agree. There are a lot of articles I have read which suggest the 'female' attitude towards schooling is considered the 'correct attitude'. I'm not explaining it very well, so I'll link the article. Here's the quote from it. I know it's not the best source but there are others out there: ""In elementary-school classrooms--where teachers increasingly put an emphasis on language and a premium on sitting quietly and speaking in turn--the mismatch between boys and school can become painfully obvious. ""Girl behavior becomes the gold standard,"" says ""Raising Cain"" coauthor Thompson. ""Boys are treated like defective girls.""

http://www.newsweek.com/education-boys-falling-behind-girls-many-areas-108593

It would explain why girls are well behaved even with male teachers, because the standard for behaviour is being set by the system which they are a part. Not only that, but having the majority of your collegues being female would certainly shape their teaching style. 

I read an article once which suggested the way boys learn is by challenging a teacher, whereas the way girls learn is they sit and listen. I think by disciplining them in the same way as girls are, there is the possibility that they are not learning. I'm certainly not saying dont discipline them, but perhaps other modes of discipline are needed. I think your point is an interesting one, as it seems if boys are getting away with a lot more, perhaps it's because people have not fully figured out what that correct form of discipline is for boys yet. 

As for your last point, I have to strongly disagree. Having a father figure in a childs life is not a small thing. Yes of course the other things you mentioned play a role, but I have to argue that the lack of a father figure is a massive problem for many children. This is a good article on it: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/co-parenting-after-divorce/201205/father-absence-father-deficit-father-hunger

Please, dont get me wrong, I think primary school teachers of both genders are goddamned stars. I have a close friend who is a primary school teacher, and she is one of the most kind hearted and caring people I know. My argument is that just as if primary schools were mostly ran by men, it would negatively affect girls and boys, perhaps them being mostly run by women also has the same problem.

&gt;So judging a player by his performances from two separate team over a year isn't logical, but hoping for some magical return of his form in 2012 is logical?

It's really not that magical if he returns to decent form. He hasn't been in a team that fits his playing style in two years. We also don't need him to become the player he use to be. Just a player that will fulfil our needs in the third striker option.

&gt;&gt; He is still some what young.

&gt;He will be turning 30 next year. God damn, are you making up reasons now? Come on man. The guy couldn't have done worse if he tried.

29 isn't that old for a third choice Striker. I think you are misjudging him completely. He really hasn't been that bad. I mean he hasn't been himself but he still has benefits and some quality.

null,false,lewormhole,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,null,"First of all, the definition of when children start taking in social cues and forming behaviours based on them is highly contentious. For every study saying ""children behave like this before they have a concept of gender"" there's another one saying ""we have no way of knowing how children conceptualise the world at this stage of development"" or ""any attempt to interpret children's behaviour or communicate with them is unreliable at this stage of development."" I know the studies you reference do exist, but they aren't conclusive, in my opinion, though I admit that my politics does bias me.

I don't quite follow your logic on your second point. I don't think anyone wants to stifle nurturing or creativity, we just want to remove gender from the equation. If I had a wee boy and he loved all the things wee boys love, of course I'm going to nurture that. But I'd nurture it because it was his passion, not because he's doing what boys like. A big plus for trying to degender things is that wee boys and girls who don't fit the mould have more opportunities to follow what they really enjoy.

I've talked about this in other comments, but I'll talk about it again because it's a theory I subscribe to. Countless studies have found that all teachers (men and women) subconsciously have higher behavioural expectations for girls and let boys away with more. This means that we train girls for the classroom really well, while boys struggle when there's less play and more sitting and writing. That divide doesn't mean there's a ""female standard"" necessarily, but that there's a standard and our subconscious beliefs about what boys and girls do and are mean that we disadvantage boys for the setting we then expect them to excel in. There's loads of debate about how active classrooms should be, and I think they should be more active and fast-paced, but at the end of the day, boys and girls do need to learn important listening skills, they need to learn to control their emotions and they need to learn to be disciplined enough to do things they don't necessarily want to do right then and there. If there's an issue, it is in my opinion that we're not preparing boys properly for that situation.

&gt;I read an article once which suggested the way boys learn is by challenging a teacher, whereas the way girls learn is they sit and listen. I think by disciplining them in the same way as girls are, there is the possibility that they are not learning.

From my personal experience as a teacher, I have to say I don't thinkt hat's true at all. I find there's a pretty even split of children who like to question and talk and children who like to listen and think.

&gt;I'm certainly not saying dont discipline them, but perhaps other modes of discipline are needed. I think your point is an interesting one, as it seems if boys are getting away with a lot more, perhaps it's because people have not fully figured out what that correct form of discipline is for boys yet. 

Oh bugger, just realised I repeated myself! Apologies!

I think the modes of discipline we use for boys do work, they just need to be applied more consistently. I find myself letting boys get away with things I wouldn't let girls get away with all the time. It's hard to remove your own gendered view of the world.

The male figure in a child's life does not necessarily have to be a father. That's something to bear in mind. Grampas, uncles, family friends... they can all serve that role. Nonetheless, I'm not sure we should be specifically employing male teachers who don't cut the mustard just to fill that quota in a child's life. The gendered way we socialise people affects adults too, and I think one of the big reasons there are less male primary teachers is that a lot of men have come to think of themselves as not being adequate caregivers because of their gender, that caregiving is an innately female trait, which I don't believe it is.

One issue I'm having with your argumentation is that you seem to believe from your earlier points that women are more innately nurturing. Primary teaching is a caregiving role, nurturing is the biggest thing primary practitioners do. If we think women are innately more nurturing, surely that explains away the discrepancy and it would be counterproductive to try to change something that is caused by biology? I don't agree that women are innately more nurturing, so I disagree with that, but I'm trying to follow that logic to its conclusion.

I suppose we'll only find out when there's lots more men in primary teaching, and from the trends I see, that's going to be the case in the next ten years!

The BBC has a General Licence to broadcast commercial music, but that does not extend to on-demand or DVD sales. If you look at some of their made-for-TV dramas like [Micro-Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Men) for instance, it had lots of great period music to fit the 1970s-80s era, which is why it will *never* get a DVD or online release - they'd never make back the costs of licensing the music on the DVD sales. But they can rerun it once every couple of years on a broadcast channel without any problems.

Also, as others have said, even if you managed to limit it to UK license-fee payers (and set up a subscription system for non-UK viewers), offering it for free in the UK would gouge their commercial rights sales to the likes of Dave.

Also, a lot of what we think of as ""BBC"" shows are bought in from 3rd party production companies.

James May's Man Lab for instance was made by ""Blockhead &amp; May"". The BBC only bought the broadcast rights, with no on-demand rights, so if you missed an episode there was no iPlayer catch-up. We think of it as a BBC show because we associate May with Top Gear, Toy Stories and other BBC commissions and output, but it wasn't itself a BBC show, and there are lots of other shows we might *associate* with the BBC that would actually not be included if the BBC opened their archives.

They are completely different players. And you can't. If you think you can then you don't understand this sport. It's not a ""Torres argument"". It's a legitimate reason. Torres just never found his striker instinct again. Doesn't mean every player is going to follow this same path.

&gt;He provided absolutely nothing for Colombia and Manchester United. Not making enough goals, not making enough assists, nothing. What do *you* judge him on?

Colombia and Man U both do not fit his style. And there is more like movement and occupying defenders. He has shown he can still do those things. He just needs some more confidence. This could go either way. He can show up and improve and become better or he doesn't improve. But to assume he is just going to flop without giving him any chance because what he did for different coaches and different styles is idiotic and premature. I judge him on all his play and then I take into consideration we are only going to be asking him to be third striker and not our starter.

There's the question of whether you can get into debt, and whether you should. It might be okay for proper investments that will bring growth, but I find it astounding that Labour decided to keep borrowing money that would inevitably be wasted, like the £15bn wasted on failed NHS IT, tens of billions on ID cards, etc. No attempts to rein in spending. Don't forget all that PFI too. And all after Labour decided to abandon Conservative spending plans and move to their own.

As for it being sustainable or normal to get into debt, let me quote part of your own post:

&gt; You're swallowing this crap hook line and sinker.

Words to live by, don't you think?

you need to pay it, or they'll take you to court and you'll end up with a criminal record.

however if you have a record of spending a lot of money with the company (say a year's worth of tickets), and actually had a valid railcard at the time, you could try writing them an apologetic letter (attaching the proof you spend lots of money), and they might drop the case.
then again, they may not.

refusing to give accurate details is a criminal offence... they will call the police on the spot, who will arrest and hold you, and the company will prosecute you, so that's never an option.

You say that like it's a bad thing. Government ministers are _supposed_ to be strategists. They shouldn't be involving themselves in the day-to-day running of their departments; instead, they should be consulting with advisers both inside and outside the government to form medium-to-long-term strategies and policies. If they're doing that properly, it matters little whether or not they're an expert in the business of their department, only that they're capable and intelligent enough to understand what's explained to them by people who are experts and make decisions based on advice and data. The role is similar to that of a company director, not an operational manager.

As a mod, it would be lovely if all posts were awesome; but there is negativity because we had a negative season. Football fans spend 40+ hours per week talking about, thinking about or writing about the sports... When only 90 minutes is played. It stands to reason that everything will be hyper-analysed, and that is the positives as well as the negatives. 

If you don't want to see these posts, downvote them and turn the option in your settings to hide downvoted posts.. That is the way Reddit is supposed to work; it is a democracy. A shitty one, but a democracy nonetheless. 

Fans will always be bandwagony. I have been a supporter of this club long enough to know that nothing will change, there are times on here when it has been delusionally positive; remember when people were convinced we were nailed-on favourites for top 4? 

The negativity is the same also. We beat Liverpool early on, and pick up 21 points from the opening 9 games, then I bet the first whispers of top 4 get mentioned from the nuttier parts of the fanbase. 

We will continue to be Everton, fans will continue to be bitter and voice their opinions either way. At least on Reddit you have a chance to articulate your counter-arguments, which you would never have got on the forums.

Also FWIW, not me downvoting you. I have never downvoted someone on this Subreddit- I remove posts that are spammy or trolling, but will upvote pretty much everything else.

Donations below £7,500 are deemed unnecessary to register for any party/individual because they're deemed financially insignificant. Labour has millions of &lt;£7500 donors and the article isn't calling that a scandal.

It's similar to unions in that they collect small amounts of money from many donors and funnel it towards political aims. Unions have extrapolitical activities, but primarily they exist to give their members a stronger voice in the political sphere, which has translated (at least in our political system) into stopping the Tory party getting into power. 

There's nothing of note in this club's existence, as registered donations are cumulative - so any one person can only donate up to £7,500 before they must declare, irrelevant of how many channels they distribute it through (they couldn't drop £7,499 in this club and £2 into another without declaring. If you donate personally you always end up on the registered donors list irrelevant of how much you've donated - so the only way to anonymously donate money is by routing it through a 3rd party.

&gt; How can someone want to be part of Ireland if they are already from Ireland, the terminology used should be that they want to be under Irish jurisdiction. Because that is all the 6 counties are, they are a piece of Ireland currently under foreign jurisdiction. A hotly contested region of Ireland. A failed statelet. Not a country, not even a Provence just a failed statelet.

Who determines whether a country is under foreign jurisdiction? What makes 'NI under Dublin rule' the natural state of affairs? Every country in the world picks an arbitrary period or situation and rolls with it - is it not equally valid for someone to consider 'NI under London rule' the natural order? Or even 'Ireland under London rule'? 

The fair and liberal way of looking at it is in terms of consent, and as things stand the majority of people in the area known as Northern Ireland consent to British rule.

Criminal Damage

Criminal damage includes crimes such as graffiti, arson and vandalism. The maximum penalty for criminal damage is 10 years imprisonment. For arson, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment.

Obstructing trains

‘Obstructing trains’ means placing obstacles on the track or damaging the track so that train traffic is disrupted. Often the consequences are delays in train services. Obstacles on the line or damaged track could also derail a train and have catastrophic consequences.

There are two levels of offence in law:

If committed without intent, the maximum penalty is two years’ imprisonment. If committed with intent, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment.

By both metrics, that puts them in charge of the country.  Sure, under many forms of PR, they should be governing with some partner, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't necessarily be governing.

Instead of defending/apologising/explaining the use of this word, with a very violent and insidious history, for something as unnecessarily provocative/stupid as describing people on the internet saying the comment above doesn't add to the discussion, which they are perfectly entitled to say whether or not they are right, you choose to accuse me of censorship and restricting the limits/parameters of the debate. 

Baring in mind that all I said was that describing people as ""sub-human"" is probably not the best way to convince people you are a rational, informed and decent individual with something worth adding to the debate, something that might be useful considering you are acting as a representative of UKIP and it might make people take you guys more seriously as a political party, rather than a loosely aligned group of ""poor, racist nationalists"".

Asking people to be more civil/polite, when they are debating on a sensitive subject such as immigration, which is intimately tied to race/nationality, so as to avoid giving bigots the opportunity to lower the standard of the debate and prevent it from degrading to mud-slinging and racist stereotyping, is not limiting the debate, if anything it is keeping the debate on track.

I was in a similar situation 10 years ago (change of career which meant moving to another part of the country, and a big drop in salary meant it was unlikely I'd be able to borrow again for a while) and I rented my flat out. I still rent it out now.

The only disadvantage I can see is that any equity in the flat would still be tied up, so if you're relying on that for anything, it might be better to sell. But you said you would just put any extra cash into your savings account. And there's a very small risk of either falling property prices, or having to do work on your flat you hadn't planned on I suppose.

On the other hand, if you rent it out, the rent ought to cover the mortgage and other costs. You'll still be on the property ladder, and you'll still benefit from the seemingly inevitable rise in property prices.

If you do decide to sell, you'll have to factor in legal fees, estate agent fees, paying the mortgage for the period before you sell (it usually takes longer to sell than to find a tenant), early redemption penalties on your mortgage (speak to your mortgage company about those) and maybe some refurbishment costs.

He wants to use the ball in training, with small sided games to emphasize his tactics. It's very enjoyable, and that's why you see our players always smiling in the training sessions, because they're actually fun! They're not heavy, so training isn't a problem in that regard.

You can wear whatever you like. For typical UK university ""fashion"", for lack of a better word, think styles like hollister, abercrombie in the US. most students will wear jeans/T-shirt and a hoodie. Shops like Topshop, H&amp;amp;amp;amp;M, New Look (latter is more for girls) tend to be popular with students. The UK equivalent to hollister is probably superdry, and Jack Wills is a sort of UK version of Abercrombie. The latter two are quite expensive. 

Don't worry too much about fitting in. Americans tend to stand out (Americans have a reputation for talking very loudly, and most British people find the accent a bit clumsy sounding). Just be friendly and you'll be fine.

Steer clear of discussing political opinions or religion especially in public places or in larger groups. It tends to lead to arguments and is considered bad form. Certainly don't wade in to conversations about domestic politics (issues like the Scottish independence referendum or the Troubles in Northern Ireland). These are very complex topics and you can easily talk your way into an argument (or worse) so best to just avoid it. If other people talk about it do what we do and smile, nod along and look a bit uncomfortable until they change subject.

Luke Garbutt has committed his long-term future to Everton by signing a new contract at Goodison Park. 

The 22-year-old left-back has agreed a new five-year deal, pledging himself to the Club until the end of the 2019/20 season.

Garbutt, a product of the Everton Academy, made his Premier League debut for the Club as a 20-year-old at Southampton in the 2013/14 season, replacing Leighton Baines and describing the experience as ""a dream come true...I can't really put it into words"".

He continued his career progression during the 2014/15 season, making 10 more first-team appearances including four in the Premier League, and a sense of genuine belonging and real ambition underpinned his decision to stay at Goodison.

""It's an honour to commit my long-term future to Everton,"" Garbutt said.

""I’ve been made to feel very welcome at the Club since I signed my scholarship six years ago.

""Over the years, I have grown to have an affinity with the Club and I feel a sense of belonging here.

""Under the manager, the future looks bright and positive and I want to be a part of that. It is a great Club to be a part of and the staff and supporters have been great with me from day one.

""Last season was great for me in continuing my development, my personal highlight being the Europa League adventure as I gained a lot of experience in those games playing against top quality opposition.

""Everything we went through last season and the experience we gained as a group will only make us stronger as a team ahead of the new season.

""And with all the young players we’ve got such as Rom, Ross and Stonesy - all of them key players, too, the future of the Club couldn't be more promising.

""If we can continue to build the team, then we can go on and achieve special things together, every one of us as players will have no doubts about that.""

Garbutt joined Everton from Leeds United in July 2009, originally on scholarship terms before penning his first professional deal a year later.

Having made his first Premier League appearance for Everton at Southampton in April 2014, Garbutt performed strongly in the UEFA Europa League 2-0 victory at Wolfsburg last season, the first of five appearances he made in the competition.

He also played in the home leg against Krasnodar, in both legs against BSC Young Boys and in the 2-1 win over Dynamo Kyiv at Goodison.

Garbutt has played international youth football for England from Under-16 through to Under-21 level.

He was one of four Evertonians to feature at the Under-20 World Cup in the summer of 2013 and also featured for England Under-21s at the European Championships this summer.",null,0,null,1435701274,null,0,false,0,cso19tv,null,t3_3bokt4,null,t1_cso19tv,null,t3_3bokt4,null,null,null,1437474967,null,10,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,10,null

It really saddens me how much hatred there is towards conservative members of the electorate on this subreddit, because I don't feel why hatred should come anywhere politics like this; I don't feel that way about anyone in the UK. I don't hate Labour and UKIP, or their voters, even though I don't agree with a lot of their policies/ Fundamentally I believe that all MPs actually care about doing their jobs well for the good of the country. The anti conservative sentiment here almost borders on tinfoil hat territory, I see claims like this:

&gt;Basically the only market the Tories believe in is one they can control to further their ambitions, power and wealth and those of their donors.

Do people really believe that an entire party just exists to further the interests of their ""chums"", because it seems to me like their chums must be the majority of the country, because I genuinely believe all parties try to do what they think is the best for the electorate. The real thing that makes the Tories different is that they believe that people should be more free to do what they want with their money, Labour would have people give more of it to society, and both these ideals taken to extremes have disastrous effects, but it's a combination of these two, as decided by the electorate that give us the balanced, functional society that we have today.",null,0,null,1435701308,null,0,false,0,cso1alt,null,t3_3bm9ln,null,t1_cso1alt,null,t1_cso0eo0,null,null,null,1437474979,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

But seriously, it depends where you live and what you've done before, housing is easier the further north you get but the job bit gets more difficult. Different places recruit in different ways, though, so it's difficult to give accurate advice outside of a specific sector.

The safest bets when you lack experience are call centres and supermarkets. 

Supermarkets mostly recruit online, bar Morrisons, where you have to go in-store, but they're currently hiring summer staff in many areas so won't mind the pregnancy. Aldi pay a decent wage, so look at them if you have a local branch.) 

Anyone can get a job in a call centre if they can speak confidently and read but it's far more difficult to actually stick at that sort of job. Still might take a couple of attempts to get a job in either of those, though, especially depending on the local economy...

If you're under 24 social housing is a pain, though the pregnancy thing helps it's by no means a guarantee on anything. You'll want to speak to your local council and any housing trusts present in the area if you want to go that route (but you won't be a high priority if you're OK with your parents.) Private route, you'll have to focus on the job first for deposits and however much rent they want in advance (1-3 months, usually.)

I think one reason why I'm not as angry about the 20 year drought of trophies is because I was born in 1984 and didn't start supporting Everton until 1996, and two seasons later, we nearly got relegated.

null,false,SleepingFish,null,null,null,"This is my theory too. Move mentioned it in many other threads that Rodgers needed to get Rafa's boys out and bring in his own allies - Allen and Borini - into the dressing room. 

Previously I said:

&gt; Reina had had a poor season or two before BR came in, possibly due to complacency, yes. But there are other issues as to why BR got rid of Reina. One was to get rid of the old guard that supported Rafa so passionately. His first signings were Allen and Borini, familiar faces, allies BR could trust, while he shipped out a number of Rafa's big names, Kuyt e.g.

&gt; Plus Reina actually did play for BR for his first season. Mignolet only came for the BR's second season (last year). This is only his second season at LFC and I don't think anyone is overly convinced. 

&gt; Back to what I was saying, Reina was shipped off as part of a 'get rid of Rafa's cronies' and 'cut the wage bill' campaign. Only Skrtel and Lucas are now left from any Rafa squad. Reina's behaviour supports the need for BR to get rid of the old guard or he would lose the dressing room before he even had control. 

&gt; As for Agger, I think BR was willing to give him the chance to be the ball playing centre back that BR likes but his fitness let him down and it was only logical to get his wages off the bill.

Standard advice: only do this if you are planning to not need that money for at least 5-10 years, and cultivate a mindset where if you look at it a year from now and you're down by 30% or more... that's unfortunate but not the end of the world.

When lucas first signed, he was terrible. He really turned it around and was playing very well up until his major injury. Since then he has not been able to cover space like he used to and doesn't offer enough offensively in my opinion. Remember how well he was able to cover the fullbacks? not anymore it seems 

I am not saying he is a bad option, he has the ability to rotate into the first 11 once in a while and sometimes is a good option of the bench as he knows how to keep the ball. but he is on very high wages, injury prone and not the most skilled player.

most of the reaction on this subreddit is emotional, so I am not surprised with the Skrtel and Lucas love-in.

&gt;I am sorry, but you are the one who does not understand this sport if after the last year you think Falcao was ""not that bad"".

That's where we disagree. People make it seem like he was completely useless. That's far from the truth. He played well enough to be a third choice Striker.

&gt;&gt; Colombia and Man U both do not fit his style.

&gt;Again, just completely wrong. Colombia fit his style to a tee, he is their captain and talisman, they try everything to give him the best setup. You are just making up excuses at this point.

Yes they try but they can't. The players don't fit what he needs.

&gt;This is a **ridiculous** discussion, just ridiculous. I have every feeling telling me you were saying all these things about Torres not too long ago as well. You can't judge a player based off his goals and assists? You can't judge a person based off his performances off a whole year? What you do judge him on is his ""runs""? This is feeling so similar that its insane.

Two different people. The outcome will not always end the same. Do you honestly believe if it happens once it will happen every time? Him going to United was a huge set back on his confidence.

No one can guarantee anything when it comes to the stock market, and so you can only take a look at your personal situation and how you feel about risk and take a punt if you think its right. Only invest money you can afford to lose. 

Having said that, here is my opinion on the current situation: 
The FTSE and a lot of other indices look low at the moment, and so it may be a good time to invest, but there could be more to come from Greece and what looks like the bottom of the market is just a outcrop of rock you hit on the way down. 

Additionally, those same indices look high when viewed from a different angle, whereby the value of equities and bonds has been artificially inflated by all the free money pumped into the market through quantitative easing, and as the flow of money stops pouring in, prices may fall. 

Disclaimer: I am super pessimistic 

Edit: In response to your specific queries, I do not know those funds, but I would suggest reviewing the charges, and try to ensure that you are not paying a minimum fee. Often with funds, there is a 0.5% fee, but with a minimum of £20 for instance. If you invested £1k, that would mean a fee of £20 would be a 2% charge, which means the fund has to massively outperform the market to make it worthwhile.

&gt;It's terribly important that you can criticise people's ideas without criticising them and if they burst into tears, it means that you tend to hold back from getting at the absolute truth.

Curious why you think it has to be so black and white for you. Because there's literally no money at Spurs and we'll just be sitting around and buying no one, yeah? 

Mason's 24, it's his first season in a top flight, and he did decent all things considered (having a great first few months, then tailing off in the end when Bentaleb's position became clearer, prior to that he wasn't awful). If there's anything to learn from Danny Rose, it's that young players can be improved. I can't believe how quick people are to dismiss him after one season. 

&gt;Inb4 you tell me he has heart and loves the shirt

Funny that you're quick to write that trait off for Mason when Paulinho has the mercenary mindset. He's fucked off to China because of payday. Paulinho was apathy incarnate.

A transfer concerns the official registration of the player - it has NOTHING to do with the contract that exists between player and selling club.

This contract cannot be ripped up unless player and club agree to it. It has to be cancelled before the player moves on because of the inclusion of loyalty bonus, signing on fee, and any wage discrepancies. A player is not going to leave that money, specifically the loyalty bonus and signing on fee, on the table. The player and selling club have to agree a solution before the transfer can be completed.

This is exactly when clubs want players sold, they love it when transfer requests are turned in - they don't have to settle the contract to sell. Also why it's a big deal when they are turned in - a player is forsaking money to move clubs.

&gt; 16 – 18 year olds

&gt; If you are over school leaving age (see under heading General rules on employment) and under 18, the law says that you must not work more than eight hours a day, or more than 40 hours a week. You must have twelve hours' rest between each working day, and 48 hours' rest per working week. You are also entitled to a 30-minute rest break when you work for longer than four and a half hours. There are some exceptions to this....

So currently, 8 hour days are cool. I think he was doing a lot of overtime back then as well though, so not sure if those rules were in place at the time.

I think it would go to Cahill. By the time JT finally hangs up the boot, the likes of Fabregas and Cahill would be somewhere in their 30's(they would be stopgab). Ivanovic is already 31 now, his future as our captain is even bleak. As much as i love Matic and Dave, they don't seem vocal enough to be our captain. They look shy and rarely speak on the field or with the press. It takes more than football talents to lead a group of world class players in a such a big club. Just like most of you here, i would prefer a younger player to be our captain. So, that we don't end up changing captains every other season. But, that is very unlikely it would happen in the next 2 or 3 seasons with JT still playing at high level. My pick would have been someone like Hazard or Zouma. By the time JT retires, they would be experienced enough to lead us.

You're right that it's a bit of a narrow band of people that this could be applied to, but they're exactly the people who currently live under constant threat of being sanctioned by ATOS and the DWP, because they have skills that could be used in a job, and being thrown into an employment market in which they can't compete.

It was actually a Conservative peer who suggested it, but the media cut out the important bit about the subsidies and fabricated a shitstorm out of an actually reasonable suggestion.
