The Streisand effect on this sort of thing is almost certainly not going to play out the way you suggest.

The point of this sort of thing is to remind staff that you can and will get stamped on for saying anything.  It's like the frequent videos of American police beating the crap out of someone for not obeying them. The initial response is disapproval and anger, but that doesn't matter because it changes nothing.  The real take-away is that people know they have to obey or the police can beat them up with impunity.

Does the name Osita Mba mean anything to you?  I'm going to guess not.  He was the HMRC solicitor who blew the whistle on the Goldman Sachs interest thing.  He was suspended, accused of selling stories to the press, investigated using RIPA powers and when he was finally allowed to return to work there were email exchanges between the head of the solicitors office and the chief executive where one said, ""his people were appalled that he'd been allowed to return"" and another queried why he'd been allowed to return to that role.  (Those emails were read out by Margaret Hodge at a parliamentary committee looking at protection for whistleblowers.)

Mr. Mba isn't with HMRC anymore.

It's the sort of thing that legitimately makes people ask, ""Can I deal with the harassment and could I afford to lose my job?  Maybe I should just keep my mouth shut.""

Here's what we do when we leave a rental (in addition to the other communications around the end of tenancy):

- Send an email to the landlord and/or letting agent, confirming the date of the final inspection (a few days before the formal end date of our tenancy) and stating that if there are any issues, we would like them to be raised then so that we have the opportunity to put things right before our tenancy officially ends. Advise them that we will be taking detailed photos of the house after we've moved our stuff out and had it cleaned, and offer to share them with the landlord/letting agent.

- Remember to actually take detailed photos of the house after we've moved our stuff out and had it cleaned!

- Go through the house with the landlord/letting agent as part of the key handover and ask them if they have any concerns.

- Send them an email on the same day, thanking them for going through the house with you and confirming there were no concerns or detailing any concerns and what action you plan to take.

null,false,DanNeedleman,null,null,null,"&gt; Brendan Rodgers has ruled out the possibility of Lucas Leiva leaving Anfield during the current transfer window, despite interest from Inter Milan, because of his belief that Liverpool’s momentum could stall should the midfielder be allowed to depart.

&gt; Liverpool’s run of improved form has coincided with Lucas’s return to the side — the only game they have lost in their past 13 fixtures was one in which the Brazilian did not feature, a 3-0 away defeat by Manchester United.
&gt; Although Lucas is understood to have concerns about whether he will continue to be a first-team regular, Rodgers is unwilling to consider sanctioning his departure during the transfer window, even though Inter are ready to push ahead with a bid for the 28-year-old if they can raise the funds.

&gt; In an attempt to convince Lucas of his value to Liverpool, Rodgers has assured him that he was overlooked for the bulk of last season for tactical reasons, with Steven Gerrard’s switch to a deep-lying midfield role negating the need for a conventional defensive midfielder. That situation has changed given Liverpool’s switch to a 3-4-3 formation, in which Gerrard operates in a more advanced role.

&gt; “It was just the set-up of the team [that prompted Lucas’s exclusion],” the Liverpool manager said. “Last year, we were a team set up with a playmaker from behind; we never played with a defensive midfielder.

&gt; “We had fast players running behind that needed to play off longer passes, so we played [Gerrard] there. When you change — not the style, but the system — it requires different things, and when you need a defensive midfielder he [Lucas] has come in and done that.”

&gt; Asked whether a firm offer from Inter would alter his stance, Rodgers said: “No, he is not one that we would want to lose. At the end of the season everything is looked at again, but there is a good flow, players are starting to adapt, so I don’t need to disrupt them.”

&gt; Daniel Sturridge has entered the final phase of his recovery from a calf injury that has ruled him out for more than three months but his return is not imminent. “It’s hard to forecast [when Sturridge will be back] — we have seen that in the past,” Rodgers said. “He’s been out so long, there’s no point putting a timeline on it. He’s out on the field, he’s working. Hopefully over the next few weeks he will improve.

&gt; “People have to be more realistic. First he has to get fit, so it will take a wee bit of time. Just having him on field to begin with will be critical to the team, because his threat is obvious. It’s the only way we will get him up to speed.”
&gt; Liverpool have recalled Jordon Ibe from his loan spell at Derby County and the winger, 19, will be immediately available for selection.

All cosmetic links pointed to Paula's Choice and she had a lot of references.

This is a quote from her website:

&gt; There is actually a significant amount of research showing alcohol causes free-radical damage in skin even at low levels. Small amounts of alcohol on skin cells in lab settings (about 3%, but keep in mind skin-care products use amounts ranging from 5% to 60% or greater) over the course of two days increased cell death by 26%. It also destroyed the substances in cells that reduce inflammation and defend against free radicals—this process actually causes more free-radical damage. If this weren't bad enough, exposure to alcohol causes skin cells to self-destruct! The research also showed that these destructive, aging effects on skin cells increased the longer exposure to alcohol occurred two days of exposure was dramatically more harmful than one day and that's at only a 3% concentration

It will become increasingly difficult to produce food in the coming decades, as the worlds topsoil loses its nutrients , fish stocks disappear, and other methods of feeding ourselves become harder. 

Add to these facts the warning by the UN, which says that we as a planet will need to increase food production by 50-70% by 2050 to avoid widespread famine, and it is easy to see that food production is going to be one of the biggest problems we face in coming years.

In the UK, we are becoming increasingly reliant on food imports, under the belief that a global economy will always provide the means to import as much food as we need. While that could possibly be true, it means we will continue to be a pat of the problem. Our increasing population will increase demand for food imports from developing countries, leader to faster degradation of topsoil in these places. And when the famine does start, it will not be here, but in those countries we have exploited, and we will be to blame. 

The best thing we can do to avoid this situation is ensure that we can provide enough food for our own population. This will take pressure off of the ecosystem of developing countries, ensure that we are pulling our ecological weight when it comes to food production, and protect the poorest in our population against price rises in food when it does become a problem.

Assuming 2% inflation (you have to start somewhere and that is the Government target after all) this means it will be 35 years till that double price makes sense.  So in this case going to Private makes no financial sense.   It boggles the mind with such low interest rates we are going private at well over the odds, but that's the Tory's for ya....  

Now take into account falling costs for renewables (note, even right now some are lower than what we have agreed to pay at Hinkley).  Then think about the investment Greens would make into reducing our needs with greater efficiency (more insulation, better fuel efficiency, more public transport) and investment into the industry (for instance not subsidizing coal/gas) it starts to look realistic.  

There is also a lot of energy storage breakthroughs happening right now (a key issue with renewables like sun/wind with it's variability).

After taking these things into consideration I see why/how we can move away from nuclear (and of course all coal/gas).  Keep in mind this is not an overnight plan either.


http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ey.html

&gt; EN110 A green Government would cut energy costs across all sectors through demand reductions and improved efficiency. We will set clear and consistent targets and timetables for improving efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all sectors of the economy. We will require energy use for space heating, and electrical use to be reduced by a third by 2020, by half by 2030 and by two-thirds by 2050, based on 2012 final energy demand levels. Specifically, we will aim to reduce total UK energy demand to 900 TWh/year by 2030, and to 600 TWh/year by 2050, i.e. reductions of approximately 40% and 60% respectively on 2012 final energy demand

&gt; EN261 We will cancel construction of new nuclear stations and nuclear power will not be eligible for government subsidy; the Green Party opposes all nuclear power generation and is particularly opposed to the construction of new nuclear power stations, electricity from which is likely to be significantly more expensive per unit supplied than other low-carbon energy sources, and too slow to deploy to meet our pressing energy needs. Cancellation will avoid the costs and dangers of nuclear energy and waste being passed on to future generations long after any benefits have been exhausted.

&gt; EN262 Money earmarked for new nuclear plant research, development and construction will be reallocated to energy efficiency measures and renewable energy infrastructure, but sufficient funding for decommissioning redundant power stations, and for research into the safe storage or disposal of existing radioactive waste stockpiles will be retained

null,false,lgf92,null,null,null,"PO clerk here: we were told before Christmas, in late November, that any post that was past the deadline for a certain country could almost certainly be delayed well past Christmas. It does depend to an extent on the postal infrastructure of the country that's receiving the post - I sent a box to the USA on 20 December and it arrived on 8 January, whereas I've sent Christmas cards to Central Asia that haven't arrived until March - but the fact is that the postal services worldwide are much busier, more mistakes are made, and things take longer. Even in the UK, I sent a first class card to my cousin that took five days to go from Dundee to Newcastle. Things go a bit mental in December-January and it's just an unfortunate reality of the system.

Either: 

1) There was an error in it being picked up from the post office (late pickup, weather delay, whatever)

2) There was an error in it being sorted (placed in the wrong bag at PO, being sorted incorrectly by RM, sorting machine failure, manual sorting failure, sorted domestically rather than international, sorted to the wrong country)

3) There was an error in it being conveyed from the UK to South America (put on wrong aircraft, put in wrong bag, manually sorted incorrectly, failure to read the destination)

4) There was an error in it being processed in South America (this area I'm less certain of as I dunno how, say, the Brazilian postal service do things).

The postal system is an incredibly complex logistical problem that functions well about 95% of the time. But when it's under stress it tends to make more errors, and your letter probably got caught in the middle.

In strictness you're probably right.

The thing is, your first port of call is usually someone in your management chain. In my experience your manager's manager know full well what malfeasance your manager is engaged in. He probably demanded it. Consider the whole Abu Graib scandal (I'm not using this purely hyperbolically, but because it's a case nearly everyone has heard of and that was looked at pretty closely.) The management chain tried to play that off as a few rogue actors. That no one knew they were abusing prisoners. That if the entire management chain were guilty of anything at all it was only a lack of oversight. 

Do you honestly believe that was really the case? That all the way up the chain of command no one knew Lindy England was stacking naked dudes?

Ok, so the management chain is out. Perhaps there's a regulating body you could go to... I wrote briefly about Osita Mba in this thread. He went to the Parliamentary Accounts Committee. Pretty legit move, right? Well, he was accused of going to the press, although a lengthy investigation resulted in no evidence of this.

So, while you're probably right I believe there are cases where going to the press is a reasonable response. Conditions in hospitals that kill people is definitely one of them. However, you have to be principled enough to self-des self-destruct your career.

In response to parts A, B and D, yes, I agree.

In response to part C concerning the status of the Green Party as a non-major party, I do not agree.

The Green party currently has more members than both UKIP and the Liberal Democrats who have been considered major-party worthy.

With regards to the UK General Election 2015 leadership debates, the decision to exclude the Green Party does not reconcile with the decision to include the Liberal Democrats and UKIP.

In terms of UKIP. the party has never fared well in Parliamentary elections, only ever in European elections. It has only been in the past year that UKIP has managed to gain any Parliamentary seats. There is a big difference between party leadership, policy and activity at a national level and at a European level, so the two should not be conflated. Further, the two Parliamentary MPs were elected by defecting to UKIP and then being elected in large part thanks to the incumbency effect. However, the Green party organically elected an MP in their own right at the start of the Parliament, and without any incumbent MP defecting to them. In addition, the Green party has more party members than UKIP does.

With regards to the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party is generally polling around the same level as the Lib Dems, has more party members than the Lib Dems, and as you are taking European performance into account, more MEPs and more votes than the Lib Dems.

You really cannot include the Lib Dems and UKIP without including the Greens.

Labour spending wasn't much of a problem, and didn't cause the crash or make it harder to deal with, but their failure to regulate the banks is culpable. 

The NHS wasn't a black hole; there was some wasteful spending e.g. on PFI, the doomed IT system, and the independent sector treatment centres. 

My personal reason for not voting Labour is ID cards and 90 day detention. I'm not convinced they have lost their authoritarian police state tendencies.

So both substances impair performance, but people generally drive more cautiously after smoking cannabis, and in a more risky manner after drinking alcohol. 

That's fine, but drink driving limits aren't in place because people drive in a more risky manner after drinking, they are in place because any type of impairment of driving ability is dangerous. It's why it's illegal to drive while on certain types of medication.

It couldn't,  by its very definition,  grasp the powers of the spirit.   To put it simply,  *if you could prove God using science,  that would mean you have  successfully made him 'your bitch'.*  Ain't that true? You seem highly intelligent,  think about this for a moment.  I'm sure you understand that this would be a gross and obvious violation of the very principle of God's sovereignty.  Thus,  science is incapable of grasping these things because it is confined to this realm.  And before you say ""the material world is all that there is"",  let me say that this is not true,  and as a reflection of that,  hardcore materialism will once again become HIGHLY debated in the coming years.

null,false,SavannaJeff,australia,Australia,null,"&gt;The public are not consulted, have not been consulted and are ignored when reasonable criticisms of trade agreements that give multi-national corporations the ability to sue if laws hurt their profits.

Actually, the public has been consulted *repeatedly*, hence why the EU decided to shelve discussion on ISDS provisions in TTIP. There has been a constant process of public consultation, where you've been free to email in your thoughts on TTIP and at every occasion the EU has released *lengthy* summaries of what people have sent in, for example the most recent one [here](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2015/january/tradoc_153044.pdf) which is a 140 page document outlining the responses on ISDS. 

Most of the rest of what you've seen is completely incorrect as well. There are no provisions under ISDS for companies to be able to sue if 'laws hurt their profits' or other nebulous phrases that are supposed to rile up the public.

Companies can sue **and win** only when; The government expropriates their assets without fair compensation or; the government acts in a discriminatory fashion to foreign companies (favouring domestic companies over foreign) or; when the government acts 'in bad faith' against a foreign company (laws that disproportionately and with prejudice target foreign companies). Regardless, that only allows them to sue for financial compensation, and not necessarily successfully given companies only win a third of ISDS disputes. It doesn't give them any power over legislation.

You want an example of an ISDS case? Back in the mid 90s, the Canadian government banned a fuel additive that was only used by one company (foreign) citing health and environmental reasons. The company sued and won. Do you want to know why they won? Because the Canadian government banned this additive *despite reports from their own national health and environmental departments dating back to a year earlier marking the additive as safe to use*. In actuality, the ruling party was just trying to cozy up to some of their largest donors. And this kind of shit happens *all the fucking time*, hence why ISDS is so popular and part of more than 3000 agreements worldwide (1400 of which involve EU countries).

&gt;The rights of a nation are supposedly sovereign

I don't know where you've been living the last 30 years, but we've had this process that's been undergoing called *globalization*. This is the growing interconnectedness of just about every single process on the planet. The UK remains sovereign even when signed up to ISDS clauses, they can always just refuse to pay - but then they face the consequences, and those consequences are dire.

Agreed, but you then state does not follow. 

&gt; the fact that UKIP is a major party in England, would almost invariably make them a major party in the UK generally

Ofcom is very clear that they are not being considered for GB major party status and that it is **only** England and Wales. 

The solution is simple, get rid of the second debate (Lib Dem, Labour and Conservatives)  and make two regional debates instead. One including UKIP and one including the SNP aired in the respective regions. Anything else would be a severe breach of the broadcasters' duty of impartiality. 

&gt;The SNP tolls around 3-4% in the UK as a whole, and UKIP polls 3-4% in Scotland.

This obsession that certain posters have with national vote share is nonsense on two counts 

1) National vote share will mean he haw when votes are actually counted come May under the UK's FPTP electrol system

2) The Greens currently poll at a similar level to the Lib Dems yet are not currently invited to the debates. 

Recall that for a while Ed Miliband was running a 35% strategy aiming for a majority. The Lib Dems got 23% of the vote and only 8% of the seats last election. National vote share means nada. It is seat numbers what matter when forming a government or voting in the Commons. And the SNP are set to beat UKIP on this front. 

It would be a ridiculous affair if the four parties included in national debates did not correspond to the largest four parties on May 8th.",null,0,null,1421415718,null,0,1421415967,0,cnquwof,null,t3_2sf4li,null,t1_cnquwof,null,t1_cnqqxri,null,null,null,1424844557,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Whistle-blowing is ""exposing misconduct, alleged dishonest or illegal activity occurring in an organization"" according to wikipedia. The [UK governments website on whistleblowing](https://www.gov.uk/whistleblowing/overview) even says it is *""when a worker reports suspected wrongdoing at work. Officially this is called ‘making a disclosure in the public interest’.""* I'm not sure what part of the revelations is due to wrong doing or misconduct within these hospitals? And if so why go to the BBC; why not report any concerns to the NHS and be protected by the whistle-blowing processes in place?

I bought a laptop yesterday where they insisted they only pre set-up laptops even though I asked for just a standard one.

I had a long conversation with Connor at the Nottingham branch who, despite the article being in front of him and me clearly pointing out the 'guidance' from head office, he insisted that I should still pay for the service. After 15 minutes he did not relent so I said that I would, instead, prefer a full refund.

Being a founding member of the premier league and being one of the original 12 football league teams also helped.

The reason I chose Villa was that I've always played club football (soccer) here in Aus, and all the blokes that I played with had teams they supported and talked about at training and before games. I felt a bit left out, so I decided to pick a team. I had no family connection because I'm 4+ generations Aussie on both sides, and I think even they were all Irish and Scottish anyway, so that didn't help.

I didn't want to pick one of the big 4 or Man City, cos I hate people that pick a juggernaut (""yeah I follow the bundesliga"" ""Who do you support?"" ""Bayern Munich""). So that left Villa, Spurs, Fulham, Everton and West Ham. Did a bunch of research, and had a couple of English exchange students I was friends with, so I asked them. One was Spurs, one Villa. History + name + form + good players + slight underdog = Villa. Also, my English boss is diehard Arsenal fan, so I don't think coming out as a Spurs fan would have been for the best.

Mattu was a known bully; junior members of staff were terrified of him, but he was also a rather clever one and never attacked anyone where there were witnesses around to back up the victim’s story. The trust knew all about it but could never muster grounds to discipline him. Eventually he did slip up and was quickly suspended pending various reviews, which is when he went to the media claiming to be a whistle-blower. The legal cases dragged on for years, and eventually the trust was forced to bring him back (at which point a number of other senior staff members quit). He needed re-training but refused the trusts re-training plan, insisting on an all-expenses-paid secondment to the US. The trust refused it, and the legal fight kicked off again. Do a bit of searching on this forum and you’ll find a number of different discussions around Dr Mattu.

The cardiac surgeons at Coventry were a rather interesting lot. Around the time of Dr Mattu I did some work there supporting the roll-out of a new digital imaging software (back when they were replacing physical x-ray films). The surgeons didn’t like the chosen system and had demanded the one they’d selected also be purchased and be rolled-out alongside; the Trust refused because they couldn’t afford to support the additional licences or the setup, (and because most of the features the surgeons were after were included in the software chosen for everyone else).

One day I was responding to help requests in surgery when a call came in from a rather notorious surgeon for support; he couldn’t access a patients scans on the new computer system, and a patient was on the table waiting to be put under. On arriving I found him leaning back in the computer suite next to the surgery bay, feet up on another chair, arms behind his head, complaining loudly to anyone in earshot about how terrible the new system was. The plan had been that during the roll-out phase that surgeons would still pre-prepare hard copies of any scans they needed in case of glitches with the system, but of course he hadn’t. 

We started working on resolving the problem, but without waiting he went in to the patient and told her about how this had been imposed on the surgeons by the management and how terrible it was, but how he was determined to press on with her surgery despite the difficulties (and the patient was suitably gushing in her gratitude). It was a performance worthy of Greys Antimony, but of course, utterly unprofessional and was essentially using a patient’s health to score points in the internal politics of the hospital. You don’t see this sort of stuff in the media, but I’d guess it happens quite a bit.

This is often the nature of medical ‘whistle-blowers’; delve below the surface and you’ll often find all kinds of conflicts and employment issues going on. But it’s not in journalists best-interests to do that; ‘personnel issues’ isn’t something which sells papers. What does sell papers is scandal, which is why journalists are happy to encourage whistle-blowers without looking very closely at their character. 

This is the narrative that sells, and so this is the narrative that gets written.

Try not to fall over as you board!

Experience the thrills as our Ulsterbus trained stunt driver drives rally speeds through rush hour urban traffic!

Capacity: 50 + 25 standing (official)
As many as the bus driver can squeeze in (unofficial)

Experience the patronisation as Ulsterbus gives their grumpy driver the wrong route, while he claims the passengers are 'ripping the arse out of this' by out of trying to get home!

Try the 'getting off' game! Fun for everyone!:

- Ding the bell

- Try and get to the front of the bus, past all of the standing passengers, with your two large schoolbags (see Note), before the bus passes your stop!

Original bus tickets, which can either be used as bookmarks, or ripped up into ammo for biro pen peashooters to target fellow passengers!

This is how it's always been.  By and large resources are extracted at the economic periphery and transported to the centre, where they are consumed and transformed.  It's been the same pattern from the roman empire to today's world, just that we're doing it on a global scale.  Such heterogenities have always characterised human civilisation

My problem with economics trying to value things like ecosystem services is that money is a wholly inappropriate tool to do so, because ecosystems behave nonlinearly.  If you've got 1000kg of gold, for example, and remove 90% of it, then the remaining 10% is worth 10% the original value.  However, with say fish, if you remove 90% of the fish then the ecosystem might collapse (eg canadian cod fisheries) and then you've got nothing.  Monetary units are simply not suited to valuing things like ecosystems, and economics isn't really tooled up to deal with it due to it's focus on equilibria and linear models.

Regarding tipping points, the problem with them is that you don't know you've passed one until you've passed one.  Given the huge inherent risks in passing them (eg clathrate gun hypothesis), I argue it would be better to proceed *as if* they existed and err on the safe side.",null,0,null,1421417471,null,0,false,0,cnqvl1o,null,t3_2sk3a5,null,t1_cnqvl1o,null,t1_cnqv38b,null,null,null,1424844242,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; You think abortion should be a choice a woman has I do to. But a consultation is about all sides you ,me, pro life groups , Catholic church, protestant churches, women against abortion groups. All getting a say on it.

No one is arguing that people shouldn't be allowed to express their opinions. What I am saying however is that using ill-gotten, undeserved, deeply hypocritical power to influence decisions for spurious reasons of religion and morality is an undeniably seedy and scummy thing to do, given that the end result is that those actions will bring indeterminate harm to vulnerable women. I just find that deeply shitty and would ideally prefer a change in how such a consultation is enacted, especially in Northern Ireland.

I feel those who are happy with such a rotten status quo may hold themselves directly responsible for the country's lack of progress towards being a place worth living in.

I'm sorry but drinking a moderate amount of alcohol WILL impair your ability to drive, whoever you are.

You might *think* you can drive while drunk, but the thing is, every driver who has ever crashed into another car, killed a pedestrian, or caused any other accident while drunk thinks the same thing. 

It like what people say about bad drivers. When you see someone illegally overtaking, you think to yourself that they are a bad driver in general. But then the day you are in a hurry, and you illegally overtake someone, you tell yourself, ""I'm only doing it this one time"". Well guess what? So was that last guy, you just happened to see him on the day he was in a hurry. 

In the same way, you might think that every person who gets drunk and causes an accident is totally reckless all the time, and just cant handle their drink as well as you. But in reality, they probably don't drink and drive any more than you do. The only difference between them and you is that you have been lucky so far, but if you carry on that way, eventually you, or the person you hit will pay the price.

which says

&gt; Nearly all studies suggest positive returns ca
n be expected from investment in broadband
infrastructure. For example, an analysis for the
European Commission estimates that broadband can create more than two million jobs in Europe by
2015, and an increase in GDP of at least EUR 636
billion. A study in Brazil reported that broadband ad
ded up to 1.4% to the employment growth rate. 

&gt;A 2009 study by management co
nsultants, Booz &amp; Company
3
found that “10% higher broadband
penetration in a specific year is correlated with
1.5% greater labour productivity growth over the
following five years.” The report by Booz &amp; Company
also suggests that “countries in the top tier of
broadband penetration have exhibited 2% higher GDP
growth than countries in the bottom tier.”

&gt; Another management consultancy, McKinsey &amp; Company
4
, estimates that “a 10% increase in
broadband household penetration delivers a boost to
a country’s GDP that ranges from 0.1 percent
to 1.4 percent.”

I found it interesting and it did make me more annoyed at the growing levels of inequality today (a topic which is distressing anyway).

However Jacques Peretti (the maker) seemed to definitely have made up his mind and presented everything in the light of his view. There were some interviews that were edited to be very short sound bites that supported the makers argument (either agreeing or being painted as 'out of touch elite'). Even things like framing the London Riots about being about inequality seemed slightly disingenuous. He also painted the whole situation as being very deliberate, which I'm not sure is entirely true (I think ignorance plays just as big a role). As a result, as a documentary it didn't really feel like it had space to let me draw my own conclusions which is a shame because it's an interesting topic and I likely would've agreed with much of what he said.

The truth is it worries me to see the kind of comments you are making. I know the vast majority of people don't agree with you, and understand that drink driving, or driving while under the influence of drugs is a selfish and stupid thing to do, and that brings me comfort. 

But just seeing one person like yourself making these comments is enough to be upsetting. I know that if you advocate this behaviour that there is a good chance you partake in it as well. And I understand that while you may think you are a ""good driver"" while under the influence of such substances, the truth is you are just as much a danger on the road as the hundreds of drivers who drive while intoxicated and then kill and injure people on our roads each year.  

I know that one day I might open the newspaper and unknowingly read a story about how you had a bit to much to smoke, were a little bit too slow on the breaks, and accidentally drove into the side of a minibus, killing yourself and the family inside. It upsets me to know that if only I could explain this simple truth to you now, that being intoxicated DOES inhibit your ability to drive, that I might save your life, and the life of the people you put in danger.

The price is decent - not the cheapest, but not bank-breaking. The [product page] (http://www.bravuralondon.com/skin-peels/salicylic-acid/salicylic-acid.html) on Bravura London's website contains a lot of useful information about BHAs, how to use, what results you can expect, etc. It also lists the pH!

This peel is mild enough that I haven't noticed any dryness or irritation from it, but it has helped clear up a lot of closed comedones, which are usually what cause my worse break outs. My skin is a lot clearer and the sebaceous filaments on and around my nose are significantly diminished as well.

Road users should be more considerate for smaller road traffic. Regardless of whether that's car on bike or van on car. It's not a case of ""feel like the victims""  - in a lot of cases they are the victims. 

When you're cycling even semi dangerous behaviour like talking on a phone, or failing to indicate (which to other road traffic is annoying but not usually that serious) is incredibly dangerous and a serious threat if you're a road cyclist.

The offence *IS* worse when a cyclist is involved.

Failing to indicate properly and pulling in front of a car when you're also driving a car, at lowish speeds is stupid and dangerous - but nobody is going to get that badly hurt.

Doing the exact same thing when there's a cyclist involved is stupid and dangerous and potentially *the cyclist will get* ***fucked up***.

It can sometimes be really hard not to shout stuff like ""get off your phone"" and ""what the fuck do you think you're doing"" because people still don't get that what they just did is a *serious* threat to someone's safety.

This doesn't just go for cyclist vs car though! If you saw a giant bus driving recklessly *RIGHT NEXT TO YOU*, you'd see it as a lot more of a threat than if something smaller was driving the same way. All traffic when around something smaller than them, pedestrian &lt; cyclist &lt; car &lt; van &lt; bus, should be looking out for the smaller traffic and being considerate of it.

It would be the Anfield side’s equivalent to their old rivals’ own legendary name in lights – the bright “Manchester United” at the front of Old Trafford, which is one of that club’s most famous vistas. But using the article “The” before Liverpool is an interesting part of the consideration for Fenway Sports Group.

The official name of the club – whose new Main Stand will take Anfield’s capacity to 54,000 and may increase annual match-day revenues by £25m – is “The Liverpool Football Club and Athletic Grounds Limited”. So “The Liverpool Football Club” would fit with that, but it would also be a more distinguished way of defining the custodians of the stadium.

What Everton fans would have to say is another matter, as they would challenge any notion that the team across Stanley Park is “The” club in Liverpool. Liverpool, for that matter, could say that Everton’s claim to be “The People’s Club” gives the red half of the city the right to call themselves exactly what they want.

There is no suggestion that Liverpool’s owners, whose consultations with supporters and the local community over Anfield’s redevelopment have been exhaustive, might be seeking a broader type of rebranding.

I don't care...

Here's the thing - no matter what the cyclist did Im sure someone will point out every little detail about what he did wrong.

I for example could say he was too close to the curb and shouldn't have allowed the overtake to happen in the 1st place. And people will say he should have put the brakes on after the motorist put him in danger with that shit overtake whilst on the phone. Some would say he shouldn't mention the phone, other will say he should because of the danger they pose to others.

I've seem many a vid where cars pull out of junctions and still people will blame the cyclists for not being mind readers when the car hits them.

But ultimately for me its ALL besides the point - because nothing the cyclist did justified the reaction of the Van driver. And to excuse the van driver in anyway by saying the cyclist "" provoked"" him goes someway to excuse his totally inexcusable behavior.

I’ve got to contest that… if the cyclist had braked having seen the bad over-take by the van, rather than undertaking then shadowing the van whilst shouting to the driver – the cyclist would have just carried on with his day. Instead he was forced off his bike and assaulted by an idiot (who should be rightfully prosecuted!). 

I’m not suggesting the cyclist was the more guilty party – but the whole thing could’ve been avoided. I’d sooner practice ‘defensive’ road use than ‘offensive’ any day of the week and what this cyclist did was try and go on the offensive. It worked out badly for him. 

Don’t get me wrong – I’ll say again the van driver acted awfully every step of the way, but the assault could have been avoided and the cyclist didn’t *seem* to hesitate in a dangerous undertaking manoeuvre in order to make his point. That doesn’t make him worse than the van – but I’ll comment on it all the same. 

You’re right that in many videos people could argue that cyclists do stupid things for the sake of making cyclists look bad. You might notice I don’t frequent /r/ukbikes or /r/cycling to seek out videos of cyclists just to criticise them. It’s just not something I’ve any interest in doing. 

But here we are (again) on /r/unitedkingdom and this time I really honestly truly think this cyclist could’ve stepped back, slowed down and *not* gotten in to this conflict. It doesn’t excuse the van, but it’s another way of handling the situation that could’ve worked out better for the cyclist.

We got the okay from the mortgage guy, go to submit an offer, and find out he accepted an offer two hours before.  It's not nearly as tidy and beneficial to the seller as ours would have been.

That is false. His ball control is awful and his passes are nothing special. 

The main reason he will not succeed here is that he lacks techical ability. When playing striker for Liverpool, you're expected to be at least able to trap the ball and have basic technique of controlling the ball. Dribbling ability is also highly recommended as we play very technical football. 

Other things he lacks - strenght, vision, decision making, pace (he's average), balance, physical presence, ability to beat a man. Also his shooting technique is good, but he rarely gets to shooting positions (technical ability). Another big thing he lacks - he doesn't make defender's lives uncomfortable enough. He has his movement, but other than that he is too easy to deal with. Sterling (who is not a real striker) at least can run at them and but them under big pressure in addition to his runs behind the defence.

You can't compensate these weaknesses with just willpower and hard work on the pitch. There is some kind of limit.

TV Movie), Jacobi (Utopia), Simm (Utopia to End of Time) and Gomez (Series 8) versions. 

The problem with the Master is that he/she has rarely properly regenerated on screen: we've only seen the Jacobi to Simm regeneration, all other on-screen changes were not regenerations.

According to one book (forgot the title), the Pratt/Beevers version is actually a decayed Delgado version, which means that the Delgado Master was the last incarnation of the Master's first regeneration cycle. To get to the Ainley incarnation, the Pratt/Beevers version steals the living body of a man. Same thing happens in the TV movie and we get the Roberts version. That means he's long run out of regenerations before the Revived Series.

But the Time Lords offered him a new cycle in the Five Doctors; he didn't get it, but maybe the Time Lords made the same offer during the Time War. So I'd say the Jacobi Master was the first incarnation of the second regeneration cycle, with Simm being the second.

However...

The Simm Master refused to regenerate after being shot, and came back in a different, broken body which, he explicitly told the Doctor, couldn't regenerate.

So we don't really know how he regenerated into the Gomez Master yet.

What is apparent is companies can successfully sue large countries like Germany because their strict environmental laws are harming their business.

[Curb](https://soundcloud.com/curbsaysmile) - I really like these guys, they're super friendly and talented

[Jaws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxrYyUe-RDs) - this is pretty much the only song I really like by them (I found their album quite boring but people seemed to like it)

[Kin](https://soundcloud.com/kin-music) - these guys are just the best people you'll ever meet and are some of the most talented musicians I know

[Peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhEM95biNPk) - I know you said you weren't a fan but their new album is shaping up to be a lot better than the first. This, Lost On Me, Money and Perfect Skin - which is yet to be released - are all pretty damn amazing

[EKKAH](https://soundcloud.com/ekkah/sets/last-chance-to-dance-ep) - if you aren't tempted to dance then your inner groove is lost forever

[Milk Teeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toTiX9vsbHU) - a very Nirvana vibe from Bristol, a lot of fun to see live

[God Damn](https://soundcloud.com/goddamntheband) - just holy fucking shit are they loud

[Menace Beach](http://hypem.com/premiere/menace+beach) - just about to release their debut which I like a lot

[The Mighty Young](https://soundcloud.com/the-mighty-young) - blues-rock two piece that are pretty mysterious but very intense to witness live

[Vault of Eagles](http://vaultofeagles.bandcamp.com/) - personally I'm a bit take it or leave it with them but then again Robert Plant likes them

[Juice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhXbeiGdAYI) - this is not their best song but it's the only one they have out right now

[Swerve](https://soundcloud.com/swwwerve) - they go pretty well with Curb IMO

[Last Light](https://soundcloud.com/lastlightuk) - gloomy

First things first: This is about as biased a source as it's possible to find, and so must be treated as such.

Take the example you gave about Germany being sued:

""In 2009, Swedish energy company, Vattenfall, initiated an
international arbitration case against Germany.41 The case
centered around the construction of a coal-fired power plant
on the Elbe river. A provisional contract for the construction
of the plant was granted by the City of Hamburg in 2007,
which set out a number of environmental limitations in an
effort to protect the waters of the Elbe river.""

Right, so a deal has been agreed between the city of Hamburg and a Swedish company to provide a coal power station, with various enviromental stipulations, for an agreed price.

""Striving to meet the EU’s water framework directive, additional environmental restrictions in relation to the treatment of waste waters from the plant were added before the final approval was given in 200842 – which Vattenfall argued would make its project ‘unviable’. 

43 Vattenfall claimed damages of €1.4 billion plus
costs and interest under the Energy Charter Treaty. The case
was ultimately settled in 2011, with the city of Hamburg
agreeing to a modified water permit for the plant. The result
was the lowering of environmental standards in comparison to
the license permit originally challenged through the dispute.""

Germany then changed the regulations the plant must meet, making the original deal financially no longer viable for the Swedish company.

Now I understand that Germany's motives were good, in that they were only trying to achieve higher standards of water cleanliness. But ultimately you can't just fuck over companies investing in your economy and not expect consequences. 

If this hadn't gone to court and been decided as it was, and instead the company had to simply accept that Germany changed the contract and they lost out, what company in their right mind would consider building a power station for Germany again?",null,0,null,1421425541,null,0,false,0,cnqztoh,null,t3_2skx07,null,t1_cnqztoh,null,t1_cnqz3p9,null,null,null,1424842264,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

that said I have never said Monsanto has somehow paid off every single scientist...  please don't put words in my mouth.  There simply needs to be consensus and agreement for multiple impacts to GMO before many (most in Europe) are comfortable with it.

&gt; pretend that the tons of studies on GM safety are make believe or are fudged 

&gt; It's all denying the facts 

not at all, I never said or thought that.  I do discount all studies that Monsanto have paid for though.

Finishing wise they are very similar, they mainly finesse with their right but rarely shoot with their left, but kolbeinn still shows more promise than bony on his weaker.

Bony is definitely a better penalty taker, and kolbeinn is very injury prone. But you could get him for less than half what we paid for bony except he is two years younger, already has better link up with gylfi than bony did, and is vastly superior in certain aspects of attack (set pieces, heading, pace, weak foot, possibly strength)

Bony destroyed the eredivise but he wasn't the best player in the league at the time, I remember alfred finnbogasson being rated vastly higher than bony, and his stats are also better than bony playing for a much worse team. Kolbeinn plays over alfred national team wise but doesn't have impressive stats playing for ajax, but for iceland he has 16 goals in 27 games, a lot of those games he was far too young. But he is well on his way to beating gudjohnsen's goal record for iceland despite being 12 years younger

Kolbeinn plays for ajax, who since eriksen left have played shit football. Ajax play with inverted wingers that are too poor on their weak to cross, and in champions league ajax do nothing but defend or keep the ball in their half.

Kolbeinn still contributes with the occasional goal but hates playing for ajax, being quoted that he is looking to leave as soon as possible.

The article itself does seem to be deliberately sensationalising things, which is to be expected I suppose. If you read up on RIPA you will see that it is not only for terrorism or serious crime and it's misleading to make people think that it was actually introduced for those reasons, as I recall it wasn't introduced to give these powers, it was specifically introduced to regulate the powers that agencies already had but had little or no oversight. 

When people think of RIPA they think of very serious crimes/terrorism, because it is often used for those and those are the big stories that come out, however there's no secret in there that it's also for lots of other things, however for less serious things only certain types of surveillance is allowed, so you'll see that there are only three reasons that any agency with these powers may listen in to private conversations - National security, serious crime and in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, not one of those could or would ever be able to be used by the BBC to catch people dodging the licence fee, so they cannot be doing that. 

What they can do is speak to neighbours and use them as informants and they can have people followed (although that doesn't really help them, but if you think about benefits agencies, that sort of surveillance could really help them catch people). 

RIPA covers lots of different types of surveillance and for lots of different reasons and it makes sense to have it all covered by the one act. The problem comes when the media etc say RIPA knowing full well that a lot of people will just assume that it automatically means the most invasive type of surveillance, which it doesn't, but people will make that assumption and articles written in the way this one is don't help anyone.

I'd be interested to see the statistics on minutes played for Defoe in his last 2 seasons and Ade's last season... without looking, so I could be wrong, but I'd be surprised if there was a massive difference. 

Last statement is a stupid one... let's not make out Soldado's assist for Paulinho's goal was anything special. He flicked it on, that's all. I'm sure Defoe may have been able to do that. Soldado's assist for Rose was excellent but Defoe delivered similar in a Spurs shirt. 

Defoe was an excellent servant for Spurs and after all, he is our number one goalscorer in Europe and one of our top goalscorers in the PL.

first week of new job is almost done. Enjoying it so far. Very different, hot desking so you sit whereever, paperless, all online stuff etc. Plus free work lunch on friday. went to Byron Burger today :D

and there's a music box anyone can queue things up on. It hooks into 5 or so different online services, so you can search for ANYTHING and queue it up. Currently rocking 90's madonna in the office.


had an intro client meeting which was *okay* - i felt a bit unprepared and unready for them, but the Account Manager who was on said it went alright so maybe I'm just being harsh. 

next week I'm hoping my proper macbook pro and phone will arrive.

I don't know if i will though, its not easy to get to from my house when it isn't snowing.

It is far more efficient to have big farms transport food across the world than to have tens of thousands of vehicles driving tiddily amounts of food around. Add in the amount of machinery required for all the farms rather than fewer larger farms.

Look don't bring sentiment into this, yeah he was great for us, so was Dawson I don't want him back either.

We also could have signed him again now and Another manager has once again decided we don't need him.

He's just joined a relegation candidate, he is not good enough for this team.

Also have you not watch this tottenham team play. The players are just a part of Poch's overall tactical strategy. Just because Defoe is goal threat, (kind of) does not mean he'd fit into this side, he does offer enough to play in out set up.

null,false,wherearemyfeet,null,null,null,"&gt; You are delusional to think that Exon have not been consistently been trying to thrwart climate change studies. Just one quick google, but there is plenty of evidence the petrol industry has spent 100's of millions to limit climate change studies.

That's my point. I *agree* that they have tried to thwart climate change studies. I *agree* that they've put a shit-ton of money into influencing the scientific viewpoint. Despite this, they've had next to no effect on the scientific viewpoint. They've been almost completely unable to influence the scientific opinion on the matter.

So suggesting that Monsanto, who have a tiny fraction of the turnover, have influenced the scientific view of GM safety to the point that they've created a consensus makes no sense.

&gt;There simply needs to be consensus and agreement for multiple impacts to GMO before many (most in Europe) are comfortable with it.

There is, and there had been for years. For some reason you don't think so, but then again UKIP don't think there's consensus on man-made climate change, so there's that.

&gt;I do discount all studies that Monsanto have paid for though.

Even though there are many studies not funded by them that say exactly the same thing.... why do you discount them? A study can be discounted because of bad methodology, or because of poor study conditions, or conclusions that don't match the results, or because it failed/wasn't put to peer review (such as the Seralini study). If the methodology was perfectly sound, the conclusions accurate and it passes peer-review, then it's a perfectly valid study. Discounting it *merely* because of the source of funding when it's otherwise a perfectly valid study is intellectual dishonesty. If it makes you look at the contents closer, then sure, but to utterly discount a study makes no sense, especially when they agree with many other non-industry funded studies.",null,0,null,1421430952,null,0,false,0,cnr39t3,null,t3_2sik9f,null,t1_cnr39t3,null,t1_cnqzx8u,null,null,null,1424840644,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt; Dr Stephen Fisher, an expert in political sociology at Oxford University,  estimates up to 9% of voters mark their ballot papers tactically,  influencing the results of up to 45 seats. Another politics academic, the University of Strathclyde's Prof John Curtice, says tactical votes were worth as much as 3% of the vote - or 20 seats - to Labour when they swept to power in 1997.

back then, i was just getting into football and living in asia i didn't have a lot of choice of what epl football there was to see - i watched a lot of leeds - they were young and exciting to watch - and united - was a fan of paul scholes, but here was a football club that had seen it all and done it all, and tried to do it the right way. 

now i have to find a way to express how much our friendship means and what i hope for their marriage while mercilessly mocking him for 5 minutes, without losing my nerve or getting smoke in my eyes. my heart feels like xabi's face before he took that equalising penalty. it's all over the fucking place, but have it in my head that i'm destined to get it in somehow (hopefully first time round though!).

By the by, with regard to the push-back on the 'banning' of prayers before council meetings, it should be repeated as often as possible that a justification of the bill by supporters is that making it legal for a religious group to impose prayers on others at Council meetings will ""increase freedom of religion"".

They are forcing an moral change as we become a country disinterest in the poor and unsuccessful.

I was with you until this, the Tories are not pursuing a budget surplus because they are evil and have no understanding of economics. They are doing it because it reinforces their image of economic competence; the average voter see deficits as bad and running a surplus as common sense. It's all good politics, nothing sinister.

null,false,eransnare,null,null,null,"You touch on an interesting issue... that you may/may not have explored through a clearer framework that questions provide.

How do you reduce immoral behaviour in society or persuade people to stop acting immorally?

Should people just stop calling out bad behaviour, should the cyclists (regardless of them being 'libtard', 'justice warriors', 'feminists') just stop calling them out? 

- Should they do it in a different manner/change their methods of calling others out? *(i.e. educating in the form of cautionary storytelling, seeing the effects it has without needing to experience it)* would that be as effective? *(would you dismiss it, because it's fake, should you then look at past events &amp; tell the story in a more documentative style)*. Or does it require like an escalation into a conflict into a war/riot to help people reflect &amp; avoid immoral behaviour.

Thinking about all this I tend to sway more to the thinking that think people shouldn't stop calling out others. In an ideal world I'd think teaching people about the effect of actions on others, like educating empathetically through cautionary storytelling would be best, but the timescale &amp; resources of that is long. 

But regardless, I do think having a discussion &amp; open conversation to tactfully explore other viewpoints is good &amp; what we should continue doing. The internet has contributed to this pretty well, the ability to view different comments on matters/news, rather than relying on what your newspaper is telling you &amp; discussing with your friends isn't that great as they'd be socially inclined to agree with the view you put forward.

His normal life has him being an actor, a fairly unsuccessful one at that. He's married, but is a cheater and constantly indulges in his desires (like the sex show at the beginning). He imagines woman as spiders, trying to catch him in a web with responsibility and settling down.

His wife gets pregnant, and he decides to try and settle down, become responsible. He gets a respectable job as a professor, sells his motorcycle, tries to stop messing around. But he's restless, he's bored, he grows resentful of finding himself caught in a web where he has to be someone he's not. So he dreams of living his old life, where he has a mistress, goes to sex shows, crushes the oppressive factors in his life (spiders).

Eventually he decides to rid himself of those desires, which results in him 'killing' them - hence the car crash, and the spider web, since the oppression has won. But he wakes up the next morning, ready to start fresh without the previous negativity. But he gets the phone call about calling his mom (the biggest spider in the movie) back, finds the key to the next sex show, and as the movie loops, remembering that, as Jake quotes in his opening lectures, history repeats itself, ""the first as tragedy, then as farce"", his wife shows herself to be a spider, scared of Jake coming to crush her.",null,0,null,1421433111,null,0,false,0,cnr4lk1,null,t3_2smjl3,null,t1_cnr4lk1,null,t1_cnr1pmo,null,null,null,1424840025,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

null,false,MalcontentUK,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"I disagree about accountability - the Trust Board is directly accountable to the public, as is the CEO, and much of the NHS structure above the trust (NHS England, Commisioning groups, DOH etc). However within a trust while the managers and staff are certainly accountable for their actions it is not directly to the public; it is via the Trust Board and other NHS structures and organisations, regulators (CQC etc) and professional bodies (GMC etc). Managers and medical staff's focus is the patients and relatives for whom they are directly involved in, and they are accountable to them but again even that is formalised and structured. Managers and other staff are not otherwise accountable to the public; they are employees of the NHS and they work within it's direction and rules.

Profit has no bearing on this - it's about structure and hierarchies that are in place that allow an extremely complicated organisation like a hospital to function. The NHS is many things, but it is not a mini-democracy and it is not an anarchy. Whistle-blowing is certainly a very important way to ensure that such hierarchies are not abused and do not get in the way of safety. However for all other issues there are plenty of ways of raising concerns without going to the press. 

And that is key here - at the moment I see nothing to justify this as whistle-blowing; rather it comes across as inappropriate behaviour on the side of a paramedic who is stoking up a political argument. It's actually a very reasonable political argument in my opinion, but for me that does not justify his behaviour. It comes down to this: I can't see how the NHS supposed to function if every-time one of it's 1.4million staff don't like something they just go to the press because it's a ""public organisation"".

But they want us all to see more patients magically within the 37.5 hour working week as they will not pay overtime because of all the pay by awarded treatment stuff. 

A lot of big bosses in the NHS can not take criticism as they know its there job on the line because they have over seen it all. So its better to keep staff quite than lose your nice job. God knows what our board of directors does there are at least 30 of them and the only bright ideas they seem to come up with is wasting more money on pointless things to put on the walls of department while telling department no you can't have they new bit of equipment that in the long run will be cheaper than that 10+ year old equipment that cost £5000 every time it breaks down to fix every month, delaying patients even more.

I don't see how there's really another way to take it, the super rich aren't paying any tax while the poor are suffering from austerity cuts.

You don't have to be biased to see things are being done wrong, you just need to have empathy.

People in poor areas of London were fed up with their current situation, if you saw most of the interviews with the rioters they said it's because they felt like they had no hope, no future. But the media concentrated solely on the ones stealing things. Unless someone put something in the water that day that suddenly made huge numbers of people riot, this has been building for a long time.

Currently, the offence is S4 RTA - unfit through drink or drugs, and the evidential requirement is the 'unfit' bit. If it's a clear-cut case (sliding out of the car, having mounted the pavement and crossed at a pedestrian crossing), the driving is itself enough.

Where the driving is less obvious (the same level that might make you think 'he's had a couple' - so a bit of a drift off a straight line, unnecessary hesitation etc) and there's no evidence of drink, then a preliminary field impairment test is conducted - which is a number of exercises (not least the 'walk in a straight line').

If this demonstrates impairment, then it's off to the nick to establish it. If it's drink, then that's onto the intoximeter, otherwise it's a blood test.

The tricky bit is going to be setting levels. S4 &amp; S5 (excess alcohol) are so heavily litigated that provided the pro-forma flow charts are followed, the case is watertight.

The interchanging system is much more the Rodgers way, and fits into the rest of his tactics (pressing, possession) much more effectively.

Not raining on Balo - but I think he functions better in a dual striker system, with Sterling or (prefrably) Sturridge (Ibe/Origi) running off of him.

Yea but isn't that because if everyone knew how rarely it's used they'd be less tempted to pay their license fee* 

I understood that the vast majority of the ~400k avoiders they catch a year aren't caught by detection/surveillance methods, they're ""caught"" by just sending them a progression of letters that essentially tricks them into thinking they're about to be prosecuted. A more expensive detection method is to pay inspectors (or cheap temps) to knock on doors of houses that don't have a licence and ask for entry to check for a TV. People just let them walk in (WTF!) and get ""caught"" and pay for their license. Another method of ""detection"" (or at least it was years ago) is to walk down the street at dusk and notice the blatant flicker of a TV in the window - again, that just requires cheap footwork rather than any RIPA compliant surveillance

\*the figures are unbelievably small. Any real hardcore detection methods (detecting a signal that is a live broadcast) are only ever used to get a search warrant. Search warrants are 0 in Scotland, 2 a year for the area covered by Sheffield and 1.5 a year for Northampton. Bearing in mind that real detection isn't the only way to get a warrant and then scale that up for the entire country and you're probably talking low double digits per year for anything that requires RIPA. If you read the FOI requests for info on how detectors work the BBC's refusal reasons for not giving out the info essentially say that it's because they use fear of getting caught as a deterrent and giving figures would undermine that fear",null,0,null,1421437882,null,0,1421457886,0,cnr7l1x,null,t3_2smu5t,null,t1_cnr7l1x,null,t3_2smu5t,null,null,null,1424838632,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

He does have very cynical moments -- well, so do you and I, I imagine, from time to time -- for very good reasons; but he can't go too far in that direction, because he can look back and see how dangerous too much negativity is to his own stability and self-image as at least trying to be a ""good"" man.

And really, he won't go to Bayern because he was a Dortmund fan? Mario Gotze said he wanted to build a house in Dortmund in 2013 and said he never wanted to leave, and 2 months later he left for Bayern. Don't ever believe what a player says, Bayern are definitely in the picture for him, because he wants to win trophies, and Bayern can offer him that. 

As for Real? Really? They have enough attacking mids? When has that stopped Madrid before? I've heard this age old argument about player X won't go there, they already have a starter there or enough players there, and it doesn't matter, they still wind up there. It's Madrid man, they'll offer him a fuckton of $, and give him the best chance to win all those titles he craves. They don't give a shit, for Reus's price, they'll do anything to get him, why pass up on the opportunity to get a possible Top 10 player for a paltry price like that. 

We are not going to get Reus, people need to get that idea out of their head, it's a pipe dream. Not a single person outside this sub thinks he's coming here. And you mentioned rumors right? From the beginning of Dortmund's collapse at the beginning of the year and the speculation started, every single rumor has been Reus to Bayern, or Reus to Madrid.

This stopped being a problem when pvc door frames came in, as these are much harder to force out of the way and open the door using that method.

&gt; Outside of this past year, he's never really gotten injured, so this whole ""injury prone"" thing is off of 1 year in 2014 where he had quite an unlucky year.

Doesn't matter. One big injury and you become an injury prone player. It will definitely be a factor when clubs negotiate for him.

&gt; And really, he won't go to Bayern because he was a Dortmund fan? Mario Gotze said he wanted to build a house in Dortmund in 2013 and said he never wanted to leave, and 2 months later he left for Bayern. Don't ever believe what a player says, Bayern are definitely in the picture for him, because he wants to win trophies, and Bayern can offer him that.

I hope you realize that Mario Gotze and Marco Reus are two separate individuals capable of separate thoughts, desires and actions. 10 years ago Terry said he wanted to be a 1 club player. Should we have discounted that because Wayne Rooney decided to leave his hometown in Everton and sign for Man UTD?


&gt;As for Real? Really? They have enough attacking mids? When has that stopped Madrid before? I've heard this age old argument about player X won't go there, they already have a starter there or enough players there, and it doesn't matter, they still wind up there. It's Madrid man, they'll offer him a fuckton of $, and give him the best chance to win all those titles he craves. They don't give a shit, for Reus's price, they'll do anything to get him, why pass up on the opportunity to get a possible Top 10 player for a paltry price like that.

Its not about what's stopping Real, but more about Reus' desire to not sit on the bench. They've got players of same quality who are younger than Reus in James and Isco. What would you do in his situation? Sign for Madrid of Chelsea?

&gt;From the beginning of Dortmund's collapse at the beginning of the year and the speculation started, every single rumor has been Reus to Bayern, or Reus to Madrid.

The squad picture you are looking at was at the time the heaviest and tallest squad in the league, even bigger than Stoke and yet if you compare every player now they have physically become even more ripped.


Our players in recent years have all started becoming really buff. It doesn't matter if its Terry or if its Hazard, you wont find players in other teams putting on so much muscle that ours do bar Stoke so quickly.


 All of our players are physically bigger every year. Lampard, Terry ,Drogba, Ivanovic, Azpi. It started after the Essien and Robben injuries most probably. In other teams like Arsenal you will notice the lanky player will stay lanky. They will put on a little muscle but thats it. Even Gerrard vs Lampard. Lampard had a thicker frame but he was always as lanky as Gerrard and the difference year after year became massive. Both were thin lads at the start and Gerrard looks a little bit buffer but Lampard looks like a body builder.


Its no wonder we have less injuries than all other teams. They are working very hard on physicality on all players. If you look at Oscar's photos when he arrived to now you will see the difference.

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt; Surely any normal person must have an ""are we the bad guys?"" Moment at some point? Anyone worked in this situation care to give some insight?

NB:  The following is based on experience of the public sector, but **not** health care.

Just like any other organisation, the people who have the authority to make major decisions rarely if ever have to deal with the coal face.  When you call a call-centre there are times when yelling at someone **is** justified, but the problem is that the only person you can vent your frustration and anger at is a hapless phone-monkey.  In a hospital they're not the one worrying that someone will die on their watch, because they can't get a bed or the right equipment to them.

I would be extremely surprised if there isn't a tendency to believe that they're managing the winding down of the public sector as best as it can be managed.  There's certainly an element where, ""If I don't do it *someone* will!""  So, this stuff can be rationalised as inevitable.  It'll happen anyway, so you're not doing anything wrong by enacting it, right?

The structural issues with the public sector invariably come from Parliament.  There's no public sector chief executive sitting with a burgeoning budget and an abundance of staff thinking, ""Screw this, let's just not bother doing the job!""  Securing and holding the top jobs requires that you're on message and make the decision that wasn't your own your own.  If you look at the public statements of any head of a public sector department you'll see they're saying more or less, ""These are difficult times.  We're having to do more with less.  The government believes in us.  Look at our awesome results.""  No one goes to the Parliamentary Accounts Committee and says, ""If you want the job done properly, you need to resource us properly!""

Bullying is rife in the public sector.  In the **[2014 Civil Service People Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-people-survey-2014-results)** the median response to a question as to whether the employee had experienced bulling in the last 12 months was that 10% reported they had.  At March 2014 there were **[405,070 FTE Civil Servants](http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/8136/counting-down-the-latest-civil-service-staff-numbers/)** and the survey had a 77% total return rate.  That's 311,903 responses and over 31 thousand employees reporting that they were bullied in the previous 12 month.  Oh, let's say a bit more than half are full of shit and claim to be bullied when they're not.  Well, that's still more than 15,000 reported cases!  Bear in mind in relation to that, the Civil Service is a small part of the whole public sector.

Related to the previous two points, in my experience public sector managers are self-selecting for the kind of person willing to be a nodding-dog.  Dissent from the consensus isn't tolerated.  **[HMRC's behavioural expectations](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/155211608/HMRC-Leadership-Behaviours---UK-Statistics-Authority)** literally state that, ""There's only one way to work here - Our Way""  Note that the capitalisation of Our and Way are as they are written by the department.  As the Borg stated, ""Resistance **is** futile.""  Mostly people know this and the people who would resist often won't apply for the jobs.  This means (in my opinion) that the best candidates usually do not want the job as it exists.

Finally (and this is an extension of the final point and also takes us sort of back to the first), it is my experience that the highest layers of management are completely insulated from the reality of the job on the ground.  The middle and senior managerial layers do not relay bad news upwards.  A hilarious example of this is that several months ago the head of the Civil Service made a blog post about a performance management which is reviled where he basically stated that all the feedback he'd had was good.  It probably was.

Ok, that's a little meandering, but it might give you a little more understanding as to why they're not too concerned that their uniforms have skulls on.",null,0,null,1421446948,null,0,false,0,cnrd27u,null,t3_2sm28i,null,t1_cnrd27u,null,t1_cnqunjq,null,null,null,1424835953,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

There were/are two USCs one had problems (including supplier insurance) and Diesel, the Italian fashion brand, wanted their money - rather than let them trade their way out, they sought to wind the company up. Once this starts with a company in this position it's a snowball rolling. Either you go for pre-pack or you liquidate as no supplier will give you credit.

As the article says - the administrator virtually had no option, but to agree. Any delay and the company is almost worthless, as it with no stock it can't trade, whereas it was sold as a going concern; this provides a higher return for the creditors.

Ashley has lost his investment here as well as loss on trade credit. West Coast Capital may also have lost (Tom Hunter's company) money as the name is bit of a give away.

Why not tell staff? I can fully understand this, as you don't know if someone will do something stupid like wreck stuff. It's harsh, but in IT, I've heard of people being sacked off-site, whilst every password/account key, access code, etc they know *or could know is changed*. They're not even allowed to clear their desks or if they are, two security guys are there and the PC has been unplugged/removed.

Also the stock, whilst at WCC USC wasn't actually the property of WCC USC, rather was the supplier's. The supplier would likely remove their stock, that they can show they own, as fast as possible, to recover the cash. If you can identify what hasn't being paid for, you repossess it. What's left is then bought as part of the sale from the administrator. It's a simple business decision, why pay for something you already own? 

In this case with an Administrator involved my guess is that Republic only wanted the stores and with a loss making business (that's why it's in Administration) they only took the parts they guessed could make money. 

I'm guessing that there was duplication due to the two USCs, which is I'm guessing is being eliminated. ",null,0,null,1421448204,null,0,false,0,cnrdrdu,null,t3_2so195,null,t1_cnrdrdu,null,t3_2so195,null,null,null,1424835627,null,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33,null

Obviously these figures are up for debate, but in general I think if you look at the figures its hard to argue that poverty has risen at the same rate that food bank usage has risen. If food bank usage is rising faster than poverty levels, the implication must be that people who were already poor are only just starting to use food banks, which in turn implies that their use is growing because they are becoming more available. 

Again, i'm not suggesting that people are using them that don’t deserve it. I'm say that there are probably several hundred thousand people who do need their help, but they have always needed their help, and there are just not enough food banks available to help them.

Another interesting point is the use of food bank usage as a headline. I believe that if poverty was rising in any meaningful way, THAT would be the headline, because it would be a good thing to attack the government with. But because poverty is actually falling,the media has to find another measurement by which to attack the government, in this case they have rather arbitrary chosen food bank usage, even though, as I have said, it doesn’t actually suggest arise in poverty.

I mean they probably had tons of stuff in there for safety and they probably would be pulled out if anything were to go seriously awry but there's definitely a perilous element to some of them that's good, even though we wouldn't be seeing it if it had gone wrong.

My favourite parts of the specials are seeing their eventual reactions. Often they've slept fairly roughly, even in the cars sometimes for a few days. Faced mechanical breakdowns (and subsequently been left behind by the other presenters, as per the TG rules), rivers, dodgy barges, dunes, deserts or frozen wastelands (their Arctic special is awesome) and seeing them come out the other side of it is pretty humbling for them, which is nice because everyone that doesn't like the show considers them all arrogant twats for... some reason. Maybe they're jealous their job doesn't let them drive multi-million pound supercars every week, or their shows aren't watched by a significant chunk of humanity.

They used to be fairly serious. Then they started adding in some small funny bits. Then they noticed the funny episodes got more ratings than the serious ones. Then they thought - well, this is pretty fun after all - and just started doing the funny bits.

Indeed. It appears the large majority of the (almost) 150,000 people who responded weren't as enthusiastic as you. http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1234

Now, I haven't studied this arena much so I can't judge, but I assume of all those people who responded, many do know what they are talking about as well. It seems the consultation shows that it's mostly business associations and large companies which are the ones welcoming ISDS, whereas, other participants (to a certain extent, even small companies) are either critical or clearly against it.

When the team came over Jeremy stood right in front of me. I made sure I could see the camera over his shoulder, thinking if I can see it, it can see me. Then Jezza did the 'And on that bombshell...' and I was in shot!

The SD USC side had the right to take the stock actually owned by the company, but they could also just take the supplier stock and continue selling it, the stock is still for sale on-line and they will take advantage of that. 

So, when the administration was announced there was already a convoy of SD trucks moving stock from the USC warehouse (which was one of the biggest loss making parts of the adventure) to the Shirebrook head quarters. If the suppliers were to take their stock back, the supplier will take a large loss in sales and also the USC website (which is their second biggest online store that is not SD branded) would have very little stock to sell.

The issue is that there will be a shortfall, due to the company being insolvent. If say this was to fall on the creditors then they too could become insolvent and cease trading. If it was to fall fully on the taxpayers,  then there would be no incentive not to fail.

Dr Mattu wasn't sacked for being a whistle-blower, despite the media-shitstorm he created over it. He was sacked nine years after he did that, for unrelated reasons (e.g. being a colossal egotistical arsehole). The actions of Dr Mattu had no impact on the change in policy at the hospital; that came about as a result of an independent report he had no part in.

I remember when David Loughton was fired; the report that came out on the hospital was damning about the over-crowding, but the strange thing was that he'd tried to change the policy the previous year and been blocked by the Government.

It seemed strange that he'd be so willing to take the blame for that, until someone explained to me that this is how it works; its part of the job of Hospital Chief executives to sit between the public, the media and the government, and be a scapegoat for the government to distract the media when one is needed.

You can also [find on this site](http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/ambulance-service-team/pay-for-ambulance-service-staff/) that ""paramedic"" is literally one of five possible job titles for people working in an emergency ambulance.

The number of hours worked seems reasonable given that it works out as about 250 paramedics (of some description) working at any one time.

Putting all this together I'd suggest that perhaps that the wage cost is in fact a monthly cost of just the paramedics (maybe including senior paramedics).

Hourly wages begins to look better this way. The FOI data then suggests employee benefits cost something like £31 an hour, and the NHS data suggests senior paramedics in London would be on a wage of something like £24 an hour (assuming 37.5 hour week).

The fact that our taxes pay towards the operation of local councils and pay towards the cost of their meetings, the primary purpose of which is to manage our local area, *not* to conduct religious services. Local councils aren't churches - if religious councillors want to pray then they should have every right to do so, but not during meetings that have no religious purpose whatsoever where they are being paid by taxpayers.

* Thatcher was against railway privatisation - this eventually happened under Major in 1992

* Thatcher was vehemently against privatising Royal Mail - Cameron eventually went for it and completely botched it by hopelessly undervaluing the company

* Thatcher wanted to introduce unrestricted Sunday trading in the mid-1980s - everyone else said no

* There were more pit closures under Labour in the 1970s than ever happened under Thatcher

I think history will eventually judge her a lot more kindly as the years roll by.

a) most of architecture isn't actually creative - it is marketing, project management, interfacing with clients and contractors and consultants, drawing technical drawings for days at a time... IMO calling it creative is disingenuous and the amount of money which could tenuously be counted as coming from 'architecture' is huge. 

b) I'm made more skeptical by the fact that this is from dezeen, which although I love, does somewhat perpetuate the bullshit circlejerk of creative types in architecture and other industries, posting cool stuff (even if obviously bullshit) because it gets clicks.

c) From personal anecdotal evidence from friends in photography, tv, and design, most of what you work on isn't 'creative' it is doing what your boss tells you to. So although the industry is technically listed as creative, implying that creativity generates this much money is overstating the truth.

d) if people are really telling me that libraries, galleries and such are creative they can sod off. Libraries generate next to no revenue. No one uses them any more. Galleries don't *themselves* create anything, they are a conduit for creativity. If they'd counted art sales, but not gallery admissions then I wouldn't object.

Also, the common people are without definite religious belief, and have been so for centuries.

He has 8 chances created to 5 of Balotelli's. 

Let's look at Squawka awards: Balotelli has 1 positive, 4 negative. The positive I'm assuming from the Spurs match. 2 negative being worst man in the team, other 2 from worst possession. 

Borini has 2 negative - 1 x worst in team, 1 x worst defence (red card)

I will say right now, with all my post history, that I don't think Borini is good enough for Liverpool. I also don't think that Balotelli is either. What I will say though, and some might disagree, is that I would **expect** that people understand that playing for Liverpool is a privilege. You should actually look like you give a shit when you're out there. 

I don't care what you've done previously, whether you where a super star at 20, I don't care. When you wear the red you prove your worth in the TEAM and work to a TEAM goal, not just for your own. 

Having said that, in my opinion, Borini does a better job and seems like he gives a fuck. 

I **WANT** to be proven wrong. I want Balotelli to succeed.. but people that can praise him for two or three good runs but slay Borini for the same thing just don't make any fucking sense. 

This isn't directed at you, just my thoughts on the matter. The question though, is if he's miles better than Borini is why does Borini continue to get picked over him?
