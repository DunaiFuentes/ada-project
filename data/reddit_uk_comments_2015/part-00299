This issue just really bothers me so much so I get really fiery about it. I knew from the second he was first rumored that Lovren would be a bad signing and that it would eventually end up in ostracizing Sakho most likely. And let me clarify as well that this is nothing personal. From everything I gather, Lovren sounds like a really lovely fella who really likes this club and wants to do well for it. I don't for a second believe that he is trying to be anything other than a good defender for Liverpool. The problem is, he had one good stretch of 5 months because his CB partner played out of his skin and he had two quality DMs in front of him to protect him. He was then purchased for TWENTY MILLION POUNDS (making him one of the most expensive defenders of all time) based on 5 months of decent play. 5 months?!? How crazy is that?!? I know the price tag not his fault in the slightest but it becomes a giant problem because when you spend that kind of money on a player, you expect him to be played. In turn, that means keeping him in the team when he is performing atrociously for way longer than anyone else would be granted because no one wants to see TWENTY MILLION POUNDS utterly wasted.

At the end of the day, I only want (really, what everyone on here wants) what's best for Liverpool Football Club and what gives Liverpool Football Club the best chance of winning. I just cannot for the life of me see how this decision lives up to that criteria.

Is this rank given for each individual class (one for Finance, one for Game Theory, etc), or will each student finish with one class rank based on all of their courses?

What I mean about the exams is are the question asked more broad and used to allow you demonstrate your knowledge, or are they specific and require detailed memorization (e.g. outright defining economic terms).

If you've got a decent understanding of the interview system and come across as competent, you'll be in with a strong chance.

Be aware though that even if you are offered a position that requires clearance, it can take several months for it to come through; some departments can take someone 'on risk' in this period, while others will hold off on providing a starting date until it's done. I'm not sure what the clearance stipulations are for Commonwealth citizens; if you've seen a job that requires more than Basic Check, I'd say get in touch with [NSV](https://www.gov.uk/security-vetting-and-clearance) and ask (like most govt departments, they can be sloooow to get back to you).",null,0,null,1438667000,null,null,false,0,ctqtgba,null,t3_3fcbwx,null,null,null,t1_ctqjmzq,null,null,null,1440269482,null,1,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

As I said I don't care if Greece is in default or not (they are) or the definition of ""give"". Here are the facts.

1. Greece needs money

2. No one in their right mind wants to give Greece money

3. The ECB has money, and because they aren't overly keen on seeing a failed state on their border father than any sensible financial reasons might consider giving it to Greece. 

4. However they are not obliged to. If they wanted to they could set on the roof smoking £50 notes while Greece crashes and burns.

5. Because of Greece's poor track record of actually paying money it owes they aren't willing to lend that money without conditions, and at this point those conditions are pretty harsh. 

6. The Greek government has the choice to either accept those conditions or don't, it's up to them.

Can you point to the factual errors please? 

The bottom line is this is the ECBs money, they aren't obliged to give it to Greece and if they do the they can set whatever conditions they like, they could demand the entire population of the country formed a conga line through Brussels if they wanted. The Greek government can either accept or reject those conditions, but if they reject them they don't get any money.

Given what I've spent the last 3 months working on I am fairly sure I have the basic facts down pat.

I dont think it is sad, you are just being overly relative. Most of europe is between 1-2 per 100k, and this I would consider to be a low amount. Few people think that Canada, belgium, finland, norway, etc are dangerous. Having grown up in Canada, which is a pretty rich country, having the same murder rate doesnt make us disgustingly high, deadly.

On a world wide scale this is very low, low enough that a couple more crimes in a given year can cause the rates to seriously fluctuate by 50% or more.

Considering Utah has a literal shitload more guns than anywhere in europe, and all sorts of strange social issues and is super right wing, being 1/3rd of the US national average, on par with countries like canada and middle of europe is frankly impressive, even if it doesnt compare quite so favourably to a small european island.

After all, how often do you think people in sweden, switzerland, slovenia, iceland, algeria look at the UK and consider your murder rate to be crazy, disgustingly high? After all, it is the same difference in rate, the UK people are being murdered left and right by comparison.

It would be for a court to decide if the adjustments you provided were 'reasonable', and your HR need to take legal advice. They will study the facts in a lot of detail before advising on the liklihood of a court finding in his favour, or otherwise. 

I dont want to comment on the facts in too much detail, other than to say that the adjustment needs to be linked to the disability. So if, for example, an employee has chronic pain so can take a long time to get ready in the morning, a later start will likely be reasonable.

He's not going to be in the front 3. We've tried him out as a deeper midfielder three times and he's been anonymous (and we conceded 8 goals in 2 games).

Delph-Fernandinho-Yaya is a really solid midfield. Offers a lot of protection.

Fernandinho-Yaya-Silva is acceptable defensively.

Fernandinho-Yaya-*Nasri* is a shit show.

Nasri said he wanted to stay, he did a big interview saying he wasn't going anywhere, and he'd work harder,but his actions on the pitch don't back it up. He refuses to add some defensive graft to his game, and with the addition of Sterling we have yet another brilliant attacking player who actually works hard without the ball.

So I think he needs to go.

If you take a look at the wikipedia article about gun laws in Switzerland you will see that 90% of it is about the militia, which is completely irrelevant to gun ownership by civilians in Switzerland.

The way it's written, many people assume that in Switzerland you can only own the Stgw 90 and that gun owner is purely based on serving in the military. They never speak about the gun shops that exist throughout Switzerland and all the types of guns that people can own, every time Switzerland is mentioned they just mention the militia.

So, along with confusion by people that don't speak German, some anti-gun groups from the USA started to spread the myth that ammo in Switzerland is banned, which in their opinion explains the lack of constant mass murders.

The problem is not the position, but the lack of principled, personable politicians to lead them in that position.

But the rest of your view is kinda navel gazing inside the Labour party stuff that people don't really care about outside of activists - you might see it as immensely important that the Labour party finds it's 'heart and soul' but the general publi couldn't give a fig and are just interested in a credible, palatable voice.

Also, Americans are often taught in interactive classes (about 30 students) which are similar to high school.

Standing order of a set amount each month with a foreign exchange broker.  They'll put your ordered money in a pot with everyone else, order a magnitude of money greater, get a better rate for it, and then you'll receive Euros in your bank account.  Does it mess up from time to time?  With experience yes - I've had to chase up on them a few times, but it's the cheapest and generally most convenient.

If it's not going to be a regular thing best to shop around but going from GBP to Euros you're onto a good thing if you want to keep an eye on the markets and do one big transfer - but either way at the moment you're going to get a decent deal (but don't do it in an airport, for Pete's sake).

&gt; I haven't driven since my test and I've never driven a van. Is this a problem? 

If you're going to be driving into Paris, frankly, yes.  I know that sounds really negative, but the driving in Paris is....bad.

Driving in France is typically a lot more sedentary than the UK, but if you're going anywhere near Paris proper, especially the centre, I'd look into asking a friend with a bit more experience.

Unless you've got nerves of steel and a suit of armour made out of insurance.

&gt;There are a lot of other things to consider which I've probably forgotten about. 

Do not close your UK bank account (or keep at least one open).

France will not issue you with a NHIC anymore.  It has to come from the UK.  Contact Newcastle if you don't have a NHIC before you leave.

Other than that register for free now with AngloInfo.com.  It's the Ex-pat website for people from the UK.  Go onto their Paris forums and I'll guarantee there'll be a hundred people that have trodden the same path before you and asked the same sort of questions.

Makes it a lot easier and they will help each other out (I'm not affiliated).

Firstly, if we look at [aggregate exergy efficiency](http://www.cccep.ac.uk/Publications/Working-papers/Papers/170-179/WP178-Divergence-of-trends-in-US-and-UK-aggregate-exergy-efficiencies.pdf) in the UK, then it's been largely flat the last decade.  There's also no way in hell we've been turning plant over quickly enough to increase efficiency quickly enough to increase efficiency at the rate that would be necesarry to explain the drop.  In fact, since the financial crisis the average age of things like cars has increased, suggesting people are buying new cars less often, which if anything will slow penetration of new more efficient vehicles into the market.

A recent analysis of US CO2 emissions (any by extension energy consumption) concluded that [recession was the main driver](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150721/ncomms8714/full/ncomms8714.html).  I expect the same causative mechanism to be behind the bulk of the fall in energy consumption here.  Furthermore, if one looks at the date our energy consumption peaked, it was around 2005-2006, which is right when the oil price really started shooting upwards because of competition from China.

Basically what we're looking at here is the result largely of extremely high energy prices, recession and offshoring manufacturing to places like China.  Indeed, if one looks at our [embodied energy consumption](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:629677/FULLTEXT02) we're going to be way higher than back in the 60's, when we imported comparitively little.",null,0,null,1438677782,null,null,false,0,ctqwou4,null,t3_3flwfx,null,null,null,t3_3flwfx,null,null,null,1440271007,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;That puts the state on track to fully exit the bank some time next year, leaving the taxpayer with a profit of at least 2 billion pounds on the basis of the average price it paid for Lloyds shares.

RBS: about time, too



The UK government is selling some of its shares in the bank. It should have done so years ago


Well that took longer than it should have. The UK government has finally started selling down its 78 per cent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. It should have started the process years ago. The shares closed at 338p on Monday. In August 2013 they were trading at around 340p, and in the intervening period there have been no dividends. About £31bn of UK taxpayers’ money has been tied up for two years in the bank, with no return. The public would have done better had its money been in a savings account, despite the woefully-low interest rates on offer. The government, it seems, is not a good allocator of investment capital.



An earlier sale would have been beneficial all around. Lloyds Banking Group shares have risen 11 per cent since the government started selling down its stake in September 2013. In the same period, RBS has lost 7 per cent. True, RBS has been in a much weaker position than Lloyds. But the government stake, and the real (and realised) threat of political intervention in the bank has been a drag on the share price. Freed of that risk, the shares might have performed much better. And by selling down the stake earlier, the government might have enabled RBS to raise equity on the capital markets. It has been unable to do that (imagine the outcry if the government had ended up putting more money into RBS), so it has had to sell assets such as Citizens, its US bank, instead.


One of the reasons that the government may have been holding back is the risk of being seen to sell at a discount to the “in” price of 502p. But this argument was always a red herring. The in price is irrelevant. The government did not invest in the bank in order to make a profit, it invested in order to avoid the consequences of a collapse. With the threat of a collapse gone, there was little reason to hold on. As any reader of the small print of investment literature knows, past prices are no guide to the future. RBS shares may never return to 502p — there is no point assuming that day will eventually arrive. Better for the UK taxpayer to sell out now, and to continue doing so (via quick, cheap institutional placements, rather than lengthy, expensive public offerings) until the stake has gone altogether.

They win the bid, build and run the plan, and profits are returned to the treasury as a dividend.

Fair enough, but what's the alternative? Build 1950s-design reactors which are well understood, but still expensive and often not very good in terms of the fuel cycles they use and waste they produce?

Sooner or later we need to get to grips with the cleaner fuel cycles and reactor designs. If other people have gone through some of that pain on our behalf, then we shouldn't run into the same design problems they have. No doubt we will still experience complications, but that's how progress is made.

I agree this reactor is looking to be startlingly bad value, but if we scrap it, what will we build instead? We haven't built a reactor in the UK since 1988. The first one is going to be horribly expensive - a lot of the engineers and builders have retired or died or are not current on modern nuke designs.

But get through the pain of the first one and we'll actually have renewed some of the knowledge and experience we need to build the next tranche.

That's the thing - *whatever design we go with*, it's going to be a massive apprenticeship programme. But that's an investment in the next reactor after that, and the one after that...

As it is, we're suffering paralysis by analysis. Oh, this isn't the best deal we could get, what about x, or y? Well, no one knows for sure, because no one has completed one yet.

If you want a Lucas++ -- i.e. somebody who does everything Lucas but better,the list is short (Matic and Masch probably the only names I can think of, and neither will want to join LFC). 

The much touted ""DM"" name in this sub, Emre Can, is not a Lucas++. He has composure on the ball and has this so-called ""dynamism"" that people seem to like (Xabi is *not* dynamic, but who wouldn't want him in their teams?), can dribble, strong in the air. But he doesn't have Lucas' position discipline (which he compensates by running a lot, which give people the impression of ""dynamism""), and sometimes rash in going into tackles.

Anyway, my point is that this talk about ""replacing Lucas with a better DM"" in this sub is FM-talk. People should be thinking about what system we want to play, and then what players you need to fill those system roles. It's not a drag and drop a new ""DM"" into that slot and suddenly you play better.

(Aside : The reason he was good as a 3rd CD last season is because he has good composure on the ball, and allow us to play out from the back. In a Rodgers system, the GK sometimes play the role of a 3rd man, especially if both CD are same footed -- you can pass the ball to the GK if you can't get it to your partner CD. But Mignolet as we know at that time was suffering from a crisis of confidence, and is not trusted to have the ball on his feet. Emre Can's role was that 3rd man, and to also give us an outlet from defense. In a way, the 3-4-3 we used was a stopgap and *has* to be a stopgap, good teams will figure out to nullify it by playing on our wide areas, and exploiting the narrowness of our system. LVG was too smart of a manager to not see that, and he found us out. Edit : Big Sam also realized it, which is why he played Downing on the wing instead of the #10 -- the hilarious commentary last season notwithstanding. The reason it didn't work for WH is because their team simply is not good enough to beat us even if he knew what the weaknesses are. )

edit 2 : FWIW, from what I have seen in pre-season so far, Lucas will not be playing a lot of games at least in the start. It's clear that Rodgers is going to split his roles between Milner and Henderson in the so-called ""double pivot"" role. It's a pity -- I don't think this will work as it is too slow and too complicated. Henderson/Milner can do a lot more damage further up. Our pacy forward line needs to have the ball to their feet quickly during transition. It takes players a second or two to figure out what their roles are during this time, and Hendo/Milner has to figure out ""am I the forward pivot or backward pivot"" during this time. 1-2 seconds are all you need for a defense to get back in shape.

* We no longer have the supply chains in the UK to support the building of nuclear reactors.

* We no longer have the experience of nuclear engineers in the UK to build them through the government setting up a state owned company.

* Therefore they had to put it out to bid to companies from abroad.

* All of our nuclear power stations are coming to end of life, at the moment by 2025 they will all be shut down unless they have their lives extended (which has already happened for some of the plants)

* We're closing coal fired power stations because of CO2 emissions laws, and with the Nuclear plants also closing this energy capacity needs to be replaced somehow. The only realistic alternative to these is gas fired or nuclear, purely because we need a base load power supply (stable, predictable) to replace what we're losing, and renewables are still too unpredictable to meet this need with current technology.

* Nobody will build a plant without government intervention (but nor will they build wind, gas, solar, etc without subsidy). However, we still need the electricity...

* Construction time on ANY nuclear power station is at least 5 years and more likely 10. The problems with capacity [are starting right now](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/02/national-grid-electricity-suppliers-uk-spare-capacity-winter).

* It makes sense to build nuclear reactors which have the same design as others, as it makes replacement parts cheaper, and the supply chains become more developed. This doesn't have to be the EPR but it needs to be Generation III. Hitachi are looking to build some ABWR in the UK but regulatory permission hasn't been given yet, unlike with the EPR.

In that context it makes sense that they would do smaller much more efficient institutional block sales. And by the way it's common practice to sell at a slight discount to the existing price.

Because they aren't. Scotland isn't coming back to a centrist Labour leader and why would any Tory voter switch to a centrist Labour leader when they can keep voting for their centrist Tory leader.

&gt; The problem is not the position, but the lack of principled, personable politicians to lead them in that position.

That begs the question of why can't anybody find a principled, personable Labour centrist. Tony Blair wasn't principled. Gordon Brown wasn't personable. Andy Burnham has no soul. Nobody knows who Yvette Cooper is. Nobody likes Liz Kendall. Peter Mandelson leaves a trail of slime wherever he goes. Jim Murphy is a fucking wanker. Noticing a trend here?

&gt; But the rest of your view is kinda navel gazing inside the Labour party stuff that people don't really care about outside of activists - you might see it as immensely important that the Labour party finds it's 'heart and soul' but the general publi couldn't give a fig and are just interested in a credible, palatable voice.

It is impossible for a party leader to succeed with the public if there is a massive scale of infighting within his or her party. Why do people regard Michael Foot as a joke? Because Labour were in civil war and a whole bunch of people left. Why couldn't the Tories stick anything on Blair? Because they had entered civil war over Europe and ended up being unable to agree on anything. You can't get people to believe you'll point the country in the right direction if you can't get your party to point in the right direction.

Just look at [Alan Johnson's wikipedia] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Johnson) for some idea of what sort of a politician he is. I'll give you three examples of what he's done that represents the Labour we need to move away from. 

1) He voted strongly for the war in Iraq and strongly against an investigation to the lies Blair fed us to though it was overwhelmingly popular with the electorate. He even served in Blair's cabinet at the time and was part of the lie machine. 

2) He told a breast cancer patient she couldn't pay more money for proven and tested private medicine whilst getting free treatment from the NHS. 

3) He fired Professor David Nutt after his fantastically revealing study into drug harms, ranking alcohol and tobacco as more dangerous than cannabis and MDMA, which is now considered fact. He is the embodiment of anti-science and anti-reason politics, defending his own personal beliefs by dismissing scientific evidence that could have been used to save lives. 

So, I wouldn't say it's a great thing for Yvette to get this endorsement, especially for people who know Johnson and what he stands for. Just another ~~career politician~~ politician whose professional career has only been in politics and who has been shuffled all over the place with no hardline experience in any particular area. We'd be better off without him. 

Yvette, Burnham and Johnson were all pro-Iraq war, anti-investigation, so they can endorse eachother all they like, it won't clean them of their dirty past.

Normally, police deliberately drop allegations when they seem unfounded and the records destroyed or at least not properly available. One approach is for the police to collect allegations unless they are clearly untrue and then to use a threshold to trigger a deeper review.

Rather than helping the situation, Sturridge's return to the first team only managed to unsettle the team composition as it had just started moulding towards a Benteke-lead attack. 



Defensively, the rotation between Sakho and Lovren at CB left the back 4 (or 3?) in a semi-constant state of disconnect, leading to the usual leaked goals on counter attack and set pieces. 

Overall, after a familiar pattern of a slow start and somewhat steady finish, Liverpool will need to assess their long-term future after this season.

null,null,FerociousSimplicity,null,null,null,"Hi.

Thank you for the advice. I do have a few more questions.

I'm currently 9 days into my new routine which is as follows:

Morning

Lymecycline Tablet
Wash Face with Simple Facial Gel Wash
Shave using Nivea Sensitive Shave Gel (wait 5 minutes)
Apply Witch Hazel Gel (wait 5 minutes)
Apply Azelaic Acid (wait 5 minutes)
Apply Simple Light Moisturiser


During the day I go to the gym at dinner so I wet my face and pat dry after the gym and apply some with hazel gel.

Evening:

Wash Face with Simple Facial Gel Wash
Apply Witch Hazel Gel (wait 5 minutes)
Apply Azelaic Acid (wait 5 minutes)
Apply Simple Light Moisturiser


Now when I first started this routine I felt like my skin was getting better. It didn't feel sticky anymore during the day and didn't look oily. The AA made my face itch a bit but after 4 days it stopped doing that. By over the last 3 days my skin has been feeling oily again and looking shiny and I have broken out again.

I'm currently 9 days into it and will keep going for a few months but I am rather down about this set back.

The worst past is my skin looking and feeling oily as I want to wash it all the time. Like today I will get home from work and my face will feel icky and oily. Ill splash some luke warm water on my face and pat down and my face will feel soooo much better.

I also find that when I put my moisturiser so my face feels worse. After washing, shaving and putting on my topical cream my face feels dry and matte but not really dry. When I apply my moisturiser my face feels sticky as if its not soaking in. I have been using this for years and never had this problem.

I'm looking to switch these products to my routine but not sure if they will do more harm than good. They are:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Neutrogena-Skin-Clearing-Shave-Cream/dp/B00LPOSQCY/ref=pd_cp_194_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1C23VYXKJGAWD71JR2FJ

This is meant to be a non comedogenic shave cream and has Salicylic Acid 1%. Which I've heard is good by some people but bad by others.

Ill also be switch moisturisers CeraVE PM as I've heard good things about it.


Do you think these are good products so switch too?

Also I think I have a lot of closed closed comedones. How do I get rid of them?

Saying Labour aren't electable with a centrist is just as logically flawed as saying they aren't electable with a very left wing candidate - except recent history (last 20 years) has demonstrated that in fact they were previously very electable with a centrist candidate. Scotland changes that a little - but not definitively and not forever. 

&gt; why would any Tory voter switch to a centrist Labour leader when they can keep voting for their centrist Tory leader

Because most people aren't Tory or Labour - they want a government that largely supports business &amp; is reasonable on welfare, prudent with the economy. The person that offers that and is likeable / commanding personality will win an election if they have a party to follow them. 

&gt; That begs the question of why can't anybody find a principled, personable Labour centrist

Yes that is a good question - but without an answer, it is still the case that there are none around. David Milliband probably would have faired a lot better than Ed.

11.Check for approaching traffic

12.When clear to go.

So the Met's budget is 4.9 times the budget of the PSNI to deal with 4.6 times the population that the PSNI has to deal with. Factor into that the unique costs for the PSNI (historical enquiries, armoured vehicles, personal protection weapons, regularly used riot squads, almost weekly policing of parades, etc) and it's quite clear that the PSNI are massively under resources compared to the Met. Especially when you consider that the Met can consolidate all of their resources into the area of London whereas the PSNI have to cover even the most remote regions of Northern Ireland no matter how cost ineffective it is. It's simply mind boggling that you think the PSNI is over resources compared to the Met, or any police agency for that matter.

null,null,shrouded_reflection,null,null,null,"The reason why I was saying that nuclear fission (did not specify that before, should start doing so) power would become redundant is because of the amount of capital investment that's required in order to construct a plant renders it uncompetitive against renewable sources in terms of energy output for materials/capital/time input. Nuclear fission also has some other issues with total fuel supply and externalities related to its extraction, but its easier to just stick to the economic argument.

Additionally, neither nuclear fission or most renewable sources can adapt to demand: fission has long ramp up and down times, while with renewables you are converting an external source of energy who's output you can not control, which means that without energy storage neither can fill a significant proportion of our energy generation requirements.

Assuming that we wish to be able to produce enough energy to meet peak demand +7% (to account for generation outages), it is not possible to do while achieving acceptable levels of co2 emissions without either a massive investment in biofuels (to directly replace fossil fuel power stations, replace with other energy generation that has rapid ramp time if there are others but I can't think of any off the top of my head), or investment in energy storage (to allow for supply smoothing). In the both cases renewables and nuclear fission are in direct competition with each other, and unless its not possible to meet total base demand requirements with renewables, nuclear fission becomes redundant.

So yes, nuclear power is a distraction of sorts, while we (government/nation) wastes time arguing over if its a good idea or not and how best to do it, we are neglecting solving the problem at hand (how to ensure adequate supply that can adapt to demand while also eliminating co2 emissions from power generation).

Utd will comfortably beat us, then go on to have a shaky start with some disappointing results, losing against Villa and drawing with Newcastle but could even be top of the table by Christmas.

Whilst I believe Rodgers should be given a chance to rectify his mistakes from last season, he is walking a very fine line. The fixture list is not going to be kind to him, neither are the fans if results don't go the way they should. I would much rather us be consistently good throughout the season rather than be shit until December, go on a 13 game win streak, then be shit at the end of the season. 

My biggest issue is the defence. I have the utmost confidence in Lovren, unlike this sub my worries are more on Skrtel's part and Rodgers reliance on not making changes to the back-line. One RB is not going to change how shit our defense has been for the last 2 seasons. I honestly hope he's not going to consistently keep up with the same 2 defenders that don't work together.

You might add a gentle cleanser after your workout instead but ideally don't rinse your face after work, overcleansing or excessively soaking/ wetting is not great for skin.

Azelaic acid increases skin turnover and gets into the pore, it may well reduce closed comedones with time. I don't know if it causes purging, it may do. If not ask the doctor about a prescription retinoid. I would not add salicylic acid or other exfoliants as yet since shaving itself is exfoliating. That product would need to be a low pH to be effective as an exfoliant, is it?

You will need to document specific threats, including the time, wording and location of the threat, to get the police to take action.

Once the police have recorded it, they will give you a reference number; tell HR what you've done, and give them the reference number - this puts HR on notice that if he does go through with it and hit someone, the company is at risk of being deemed to have created a dangerous work environment by not addressing his issues.

Secondly, raise a formal grievance (ACAS can help here) about the parts that you think are actively dangerous rather than just poor form (H&amp;S breaches, threats of violence, verbal harassment, possibly anger outbursts, but not timekeeping or job performance), and get the people who refuse to be alone with him to raise this as a formal written complaint to HR (again, ACAS can help). You will need to document times and dates of every incident; keeping a diary can help you get this right.

As long as HR think that the risk is grouching from you and your team versus legal action from the problem employee, they'll side with the problem employee over you guys; HR's role in this sort of dispute is to ensure that the risks involved in firing the employee are lower than the risks involved in keeping him on.

To suggest that any of our other CBs even come close is a stretch, this won't be his 9th season at the club out of sentiment.

Looking at two seasons ago, we never looked confident in defence.  We didn't fail to win the league because of one slip, and the one thing the partnership (which really started to irreparably fall apart against Norwich) hasn't done is improved.  If Rodgers wants to go with Skrtel, which he will, he might think it's time to try other options.  He can't trust his job to a partnership which never contributes to our runs of great form - it's only ever covered by it.

I'm not saying Skrtel/Lovren is that good either, it's not.

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_Principles) for the interested though I'm sure it's well known.

Unfortunately, we hear reports that the crime rate is falling. It suits the government to say that, but a more statistically accurate phrase would be that **reported** crime is falling. Because there are less police to report it to, because more people have less confidence that there is any point in reporting certain crime unless they're out of pocket and need the crime number for insurance purposes. Home Office Counting Rules (the rules by which police have to record crime incidents) are at the strictest they have been since their inception.

It's important to understand that policing isn't all police do any more, and as a result, the job is more about managing risk than it is about solving crime. Stuff like missing persons, filling the gaps left by the lack of mental health services, cuts to the ambulance service - this is not about crime, it's about protecting the public, which is the first principle by which we must abide. There are other agencies that should be helping us fulfil that goal, like the social services, local authorities and the LAS.

null,null,Anandya,null,null,null,"I am a doctor. I am the son of doctors on the NHS. The simple line is this. 

Over the past 20 years doctors have taken effective pay cuts. 

1. Our pensions got fucked. The same as the MPs recently but without a 10% net increase in salary. We haven't seen increases in our salary with inflation either. 

2. We took a monster pay  cut via the loss of subsidy for our educations. Yeah we NEED doctors but we certainly aren't going to pay for them! Now doctors come out with huge debts. 80 to 100 grand. Only really rich people can afford that kind of debt and most people are heavily enticed by people who can pay salaries that can wipe out that kind of debt. AKA America and the Middle East. Australia is also really tempting. 

3. With regards to 7 day NHS? My fiancee is a doctor in the UK (I work for a charity in India. I DO work 7 day week. I don't get weekends. I get a half day off on Sunday and finish at around noon after starting at 7 AM and I only need to go in for emergencies. But this is a developing country, the UK has no excuse) and her first rotation is 12 days on, 2 days off. Yeah. Name one group of people who work those hours? Nurses get more hours off and yes they do a great job but everyone's either demonising people who work above 40 hours a week or work in jobs that no one else wants to do. 

4. Everyone doesn't quite know what a doctor does. It's quite simple. We take responsibility. The nurse gives you your drugs but we have the knowledge/skills to make the decision to give drugs over and above the nurse. We also decide treatment and do diagnosis. Nurses may learn how to do some but we have to know way more. Nurses deal with the grunt work of the treatment, we do the finesse work. It's why it takes way longer to train a doctor. 

5. Worst bit? The current government is not hiring as many doctors due to the mentioned ""Doctors are Work Shy"". People don't think it is as important as nurses. However neither can work without the other. 

6. The shortages are hurting the system even more. Shortages mean more locum doctors. After all? 80 Grand of debt isn't something to sneeze at. You are tempting newbie doctors to gouge the system to survive. Hell? I have to take up locums to get myself on the ground. 

We have major shortages in places like A&amp;E thanks to Jeremy Hunt cutting services in smaller places resulting in larger places getting overrun. We are going to see more and more costs to the NHS thanks to an ageing population and fewer doctors since we reduced recruitment. 

I mean doctors themselves are fighting for lower pay and better working conditions. I mean does anyone think the people who can leverage an American Style Salary under a private sector hospital are interested in just money? No. We want the NHS to succeed because we think it is deeply unethical that poor people need wallet biopsies before treatment. 

If people worked my hours they would quit. I have work 6 to 7 days a week with 3 weeks off a year. I put up one to three continuous shifts. Some weeks I work 12 hours straight each day except for 2 days a week where I work 36 hours.

null,null,HappyResultsDay,null,null,null,"This is all basically politics. I won't take a position on the rights and wrongs of it as that's not what I'm here to do but I will try to explain how this all works and the facts around it. Feel free to debate below but I won't get involved except to state facts.

First thing to understand is that these decisions are all Scottish Government. When the UK Government decided to impose fees they also cut the funding that went with each place. That meant the Scottish Government would either have to impose fees on students from the rest of the UK or make up that funding shortfall. They chose the former and Scottish unis have no option but to do what they say. The one option we do have is fee levels but as we've seen in the UK most Scottish Unis have now got to the upper levels of the current limit (not all, SRUC I think being the cheapest?). 

The only thing that is different here is that a standard degree in Scotland is 4 years. Some unis have chosen to look at the cost of a degree and charge £27,000 in total, some over 3 years with a free final year some over 4 years evenly split. The two exceptions are Edinburgh and St. Andrews, both have chosen to charge £9,000 each year for all 4 years. Their reasoning is that a year of education is what you are paying for not a degree certificate. 

In terms of your situation it isn't based entirely on citizenship, it is mostly based on residency. The limit is generally 3 years of living in a particular country/part of the UK with your family, being sent up to boarding school in Scotland for 3 years will not work unless your whole family move too (or you can convince SAAS that they have).

When the Scottish Government abolished the graduate tax in Scotland and decided education should be free they had only ever intended that to be for Scottish students. However EU law says that you cannot discriminate against the people of another EU country. England, Wales and Northern Ireland do not count as other EU countries. The Scottish Government tried to challenge the rules that they had to offer free tuition to all other EU countries in the European Courts but gave up when it was clear they would lose.

What EU students do not get is any help with living costs. They may be tuition fee free but there is no student loans to help them. This the Scottish Government can do though I'm not sure how that works.

In terms of yourself, if you want to find out your eligibility check with [SAAS here](http://www.saas.gov.uk/full_time/ug/independent/eligibility_index.htm). They are a Scottish Government body who set policy and make decisions on this stuff.

Other things to be aware of is competitiveness. This varies but University but Scotland's ancient unis (Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and St. Andrews) have a generally very good international relationship. That means they get a lot of applications from Scotland and Scottish students have to compete against the whole EU. Some unis seem to do some stuff to inflate EU grade requirements, I'm not sure how they justify this but I imagine the Scottish Government quite like it and there is no simple equivalence table so it's hard to argue with. These students are all competing for a limited number of places, we do not get a blank cheque from the Government to recruit as many as we want.

There are no limits on the numbers of students from the rest of UK that we can bring in. These were recently scrapped and there is no external competition for these places. That means if a University wants to expand it has to either attract more students from outside of the EU, really hard to do due to international fees being pretty hefty, or from the rest of UK. 

That means that actually in some courses, not all it is now easier to get in as an rUK student than it is as a Scottish/EU student though you do then pay fees once you get here (though you do get loans to cover those obviously).

Rodgers needs to be put under pressure after every game. If we win, he needs to be pressured to make sure he continues winning week after week. If we draw he needs to make the right decision in what needed to be changed to turn the point into 3, and if we lose he needs to realise that 9/10 something could/should have been done differently. Obviously talking about different types of pressure here, he isn't going to be sacked if we lose to Stoke, but if we lose 1 game against anyone then he needs to work on solutions for the next game. There isn't a team in the league that we can look at and say ""we have almost no chance of beating them"" because on our day we can beat (and lose to for that matter) any other team in the league.

If we lost 1-0 to Chelsea after battering them for 88 minutes then they had a lucky goal that snuck in then that's obviously different to losing 3-0 at home to Norwich, you can accept some defeats but what can't be acceptable is thinking that just because a defeat was close or pure bad luck that nothing needs to be done.

So when I put that adverb in the middle of that sentence, it means that not every single CB across the globe wore 6. It does not even mean that the majority of CBs across the world wore them. It merely means it has happened many times.

Don't worry if you cannot be bothered, but I was wondering if you could do a quick summary of your club, and how much playing time you think he'll get. Not heard of your club before ;)

As you asked if Kane is good, I'll give you a brief summary of him. He was absolutely vital in Chelsea's 2012 fa youth cup winning squad along with Nathaniel Chalobah, and then he went on loan to Blackburn and Nottingham Forest where he was great both times. Kane is a right footed right back, and I think his best attribute is his stamina and willingness to get forward. He'll be up and down that right flank all game long. His crossing needs to improve a little bit, but it's still not bad. He also has a great shot and has scored some rockets in the past.

I'm denying their right to do that with state assistance (no one is saying make suicide illegal, which is completely unenforceable) because I think their life does have value and they can be ""helped"". Perhaps this does make me a tyrannical 'life' dictator. 

I'd also add that I don't think we should allow suicide for anyone who is just suffering from pain (like a bad flu) but rather those suffering from incurable, terminal sickness because at that point my belief that we can help them is untrue and we should begin looking at QoL. As I said death might be a mercy.

In both cases because of fission power having a higher strike price in order to render it economical for the plant to be built, your better off just disposing of it all together and putting the money into either getting enough bio-plants up and running to cope, or putting it into solving the storage problem.

You have got to be fucking joking me. I will give you the majority of parades and riot squads are caused by unionist activity (though a far cry from 'all' of them) but you're really claiming that the threats from being blown up, attacked, or any of the historical enquires, which are driven almost exclusively by nationalist families demanding answers, is the cause of unionists? You're beyond blinded by ideology if that's what you're honestly arguing. The unionists are not the ones who are creating a threat to the lives of police officers. The unionists are not the ones, by and large, demanding investigations into historical crimes during the troubles. It is laughable that you even try and attribute those aspects to the unionists.

From the sheer ridiculousness of your assertions and the ease with which they're disproved by the simplest of investigation it just makes you seem like a blinded ideologue who doesn't care at all about the truth of the matter and is only interested in regurgitating anything that may further your agenda, no matter how ridiculous and untruthful it may be.",null,0,null,1438688601,null,null,false,0,ctqzfk7,null,t3_3fpssx,null,null,null,t1_ctqyt9w,null,null,null,1440272365,null,15,null,northernireland,t5_2qlve,15,null

From the figures that were thrown about in wages for Benteke, Firmino and Milner it seems like the club are starting to increase the amount they're paying in wages, which is good, but it lags behind the wage spending of last season's top four. I remember reading that Benteke is on roughly 120K/week...that's a generous wage but I'm sure if you took the average weekly salary of the starting strikers for last season's top 4 teams then Benteke's wage would be well below the average. 

This is obviously a chicken and the egg type situation: do certain teams win the league more often because they offer huge wages, or do they attract players good enough to command those wages because they have a history of success?

I studied international politics at a uk university and studied abroad in Canada (which is very similar in terms of academic culture). I found there was a lot more textbooking in Canada and a lot more random-ass tests that didn't count for anything. It's a lot more structured and less independent research. I think I said to someone 'I feel like I'm doing more reading, but learning less'. e.g. for a seminar in the UK, we were given a page long reading list and told to do research from that for our seminar. Didn't have to read everything, but the more you read, the better the seminar was. In Canada, I was given a shorter reading list and expected to read it all. Then the seminar was more based on what the text said, rather than what we thought about the issue/event/concept. 

That said, have you considered Canada as an option? As it would be cheaper, a lot of universities there have things for US students that don't consider them international properly, and you can drink from 18 or 19 depending on the province. 

But yeah, I think the workload thing comes from more 'liberal' subjects (especially languages. The way Americans teach languages is insane and work for work's sake and... anyway.), where it *looks* like less work but you've got to do more yourself.

There's other things in the smoking section but they have to be offered to all eligible patients who don't refuse the advice.  Dozens of other metrics and services provided are taken into account (diabetes care, contraception, etc) then the payment is calculated by list size in some way.

Edit - it's horribly complicated, found it [here](http://bma.org.uk/-/media/files/pdfs/practical%20advice%20at%20work/contracts/independent%20contractors/qof%20guidance/focusonqofpaymentsnov2013.pdf) - PDF.

Anyway, based on [these statistics](http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_93.pdf) there are about ten million smokers in the UK.  If GPs could earn £300 for each of these people being given smoking advice, that means £3 billion per year would be spent on this alone.  Which seems a bit high.  

If a typical sized practice with a list size of 3,000 patients contains 600 smokers, it means that the practice could earn £180,000 per year for smoking cessation work alone.  This seems a bit high, don't you think?

- Van Persie - £200,000 a week + £24m transfer fee. Aged 29, had little to no resale value (£3.5m to a Turkish club) after 2-3 years of service. 

- Daniel Sturridge - £70,000 a week (initially, obviously on more after new contracts etc) and £12m transfer fee. 2 years of service so far, easily worth £25-??? million after taking into consideration his injury record and has cost about £10m in wages (roughly?) which is about half of what RVP cost United in wages. If we sold Sturridge today the cost of his fee+total wages to this point would be less than what we sold him for, whereas United would make a huge loss on RVP's combined figures.

The Benteke one is slightly similar. He's a proven PL talent. If he scores 20 goals this season his value will probably be justified, if he scores 30 there's a chance he'd be worth £40-45m? His wages will be about 1/3 of Falcao's, so that alone makes Falcao's year loan at United cost about £20-25m (285k a week wages, £6m fee) whereas Benteke will still be worth something after he leaves Liverpool, providing it's before he retires.

Clearly not everyone does, or else suicide wouldn't be a thing.  You cannot deny that there exist people who wish to end their lives, and generally they are forced to do so in rather unpleasant ways because of the difficulty of finding painless ways to end it all, so you are potentially increasing suffering with this choice.

As for your last statement, this isn't ""total hyperbole"", it's an interesting conversation.  Suicide and suffeing is something that plenty of philosophers (Schopenhauer, Camus, Kant to name but a few) have long thought about, and a fair number aren't necesarilly against (Zapffe, Brassier, Benatar).  Furthermore, your prior arguments negate your final argument, namely that we remove the possibility of joy.  In all your prior arguments, you are operating under the premise that *removal of suffering* is morally more important than causing pleasure, which I agree with as I see suffering as having only negative value.  Furthermore while suffering and death is *always* inevitable for any living human, pleasure is not.  Therefore a painless suicide, which negates the possibility of a painful death, is morally superior to letting someone live with the *guarantee* of suffering through death, with no guarantee of pleasure.",null,0,null,1438689506,null,null,false,0,ctqzpum,null,t3_3fq7qu,null,null,null,t1_ctqzat2,null,null,null,1440272500,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

No, the person who receives the goods in the UK will be responsible for this, perhaps this is you but it's unclear.

No you don't.

&gt; If the person you are selling to is VAT-Registered Business, they will be collecting VAT from their customers. Does that mean, I, the supplier then have to pay any VAT? It sounds like the responsibility of paying/collecting VAT is transferred to my vendor.

If the person has a VAT registered business they will pay the 20% import tax up front, then collect 20% of their total EU/UK sales, this can be offset against the original amount they paid.

&gt; I buy from my supplier for $X, and selling it to my vendor/distributor for $Y. Do I pay VAT on how much I get the goods from my supplier, or how much I am selling it to my vendor in UK, when importing?

Its great the law says you can use tools to defend yourself if they are at hand (and no sign of premeditation ) but unless you sleep with a baseball bat in your room or sleep in your garden shed then a good tool for the job is probably out of reach. I say, fuck all that shit and if you want a spray/baton and maybe even a taser (if licenced like a police officer would be) by your bed then that's a choice for you to make ,not me. 

Not really. If you have a weapon by your bedside for the purpose of hitting someone then that does infer premeditation by definition. People should absolutely have the right to protect their home and I think the current law covers this more than is generally assumed. Giving people access to Taser etc will increase the general prevalence of such weaponry outside the home as well as within. I'll say it again: off-duty police have the same level of protection when within their homes as the general public. Police carry additional PPE whilst on-duty to protect themselves against incidents such as the above, which are far more likely to be encountered than by the general public. How many times have you dealt with someone carrying a knife or other offensive weapon?

&gt; we have draconian gun control laws in place, if people could carry guns they would. Either the laws don't work (then whats the point?) Or they do and wont be able to Carry .

Not sure what you're getting at here? Regarding people carrying guns if they could - not necessarily. See America, where many people who can choose not to, for various reasons.

The biggest red flag to me is the lack of deposit protection - [all landlords are required by law to put the deposit in a government deposit scheme](https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection/overview).

It sounds like the original landlord has sold the property to another person without notifying you. It's certainly considered good practice to inform the tenant of this but I'm not sure if it's a legal requirement. 

I can't say for sure if you're being scammed but it definitely sounds like your new landlord is either inexperienced or trying to cut corners. You have a number of rights as a tenant, so make sure they are being honoured.

She's definitely lying to whoever she's trying to get a mortgage from though - the mortgage conditions for a private home are different from buy to let. That's not a good sign.

Edit: Oh yeah, and also, if your tenancy contract follows standard patterns, she can't show people round without your consent and at least 24 hours notice.

I do agree that Nasri isn't as adept defensively, but I don't agree that he won't play up front in attack. Without KdB, Nasri is City's third best AM (behind Silva and Sterling) and still miles better than Lopes and Navas.  We all make so many excuses for Navas - oh he'll be good as a substitution winger who can change a match, but that would mean City make a slight change to the formation. What's wrong with Nasri coming on for a Sterling or whomever to tighten up a match. He's still one of the best close-quarters possession in the league, and can easily contribute with goal scoring. It's totally feasible to have an attacking three of Silva/Aguero/Nasri and have it to work well. I don't think you can write him off as a ""front three"" so easily. And even then, I'm still not convinced it won't be a front four. Also if formations change midseason, you'll probably see MP switch to something like a 442 anyways. If we're talking formations and a midfield three, why couldn't a Delph-Fernando-Nasri work? Two hard working DM-ish players with a deep lying guy who gets forward. That's essentially similar to a double pivot. 

It's a tough assumption to say he'll be sulking b/c he's not first choice, because he really hasn't been in his whole career at City but he's put in efforts. I agree he's up and down but until Lopes proves he is ready for PL matches (meaning he needs to perform like it in a cup game or PL match, not in preseason against Vietnam), I just am not ready to give the spot to him over a guy who basically won us a match in Roma last year.

The Labour party in Northern Ireland is against state sponsored apartheid education systems that divide children according the religion of their parents and provides a principal architecture for communal division in Northern Ireland. The SDLP actively support such systems of division.

You might as well say the Labour Party ""should have a more formal agreement with the SNP"" on the vague basis that they're both parties of the left.

How can the Labour Party speak with credibility on the union, on creating a better and more stable Northern Ireland and use the phrase 'One Nation', when it persists in denying its membership in Northern Ireland the right to stand for election on Labour Party values - which, as described above, are not being provided for by anyone else?

* The driver overtook me while I was coasting to a red light - this is infuriating because I have been pacing myself to hopefully be able to roll through as the light turns green, no one is going anywhere, and now instead of being able to roll throughI'm likely going to have to stop short and unclip my shoes
* There are more cars in front of me than will get through the lights at once; this is somewhat selfish but when this happens it means rush hour and when it's rush hour I find I am of no real consequence, often moving faster than the traffic in general. It's self righteous of me but you wouldn't have such a big queue if the majority of the drivers taking up space were on bicycles.

Essentially in the city centre if you see a red light ahead and there is a cyclist in front of you it's probably of no benefit to you to overtake the cyclist. Often I find people just see cyclist and immediately go for the overtake without really considering the environment around them.

They've also recently built a big joint venture manufacturing and research plant on the outskirts of the city. If you were looking for work experience or a course with a year in industry (well sought-after!), then this might not be a bad idea.

Sheffield also has the quirk of not being a 'campus' university. If you want to feel part of city life in Yorkshire, you'll find most of the uni buildings are mixed in with the rest of the city.

Get to the point your 5 year deal is up and then sell. You'll have been trading for 5 years so will have eligibility with more lenders, you'll be out of the £10k penalty, you'll have made some money from renting your current property out and hopefully the house will be worth more as well.

Because the whole point of these reserves is because they're capped hydrocarbon traps. If they weren't naturally.capped and sealed, the hydrocarbons would already have escaped and polluted aquifers.

Therefore,.provided the drilling and capping is done properly (which we've demonstrated our expertise at in this country for over 50 years now) there is minimal risk of contamination. And being that only non toxic frac'ing additives are used in the UK anyway, and most frac'ing will not take place near water reserve extraction, the make up of frac'ing fluid is a moot point. The hydrocarbons in the rock already are more toxic and polluting than anything we leave down there.

It's not toxic,  so it doesn't matter, it is largely.recovered, so it doesn't matter, and it's in a capped contained source rock, so it doesn't matter.

But 'pumping dangerous chemicals into our underground water supply' sounds so much better.

There's a fundamental lack of knowledge about sub strata resource exploitation that means it's easy to scare monger, and very hard to refute accusations that if you're pro frac'ing, you must be anti environment.

&gt;    an uninterrupted 48 hours without any work each fortnight

&gt;A worker’s employment contract may say they’re entitled to more or different rights to breaks from work.

null,null,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"Niacinamide is vitamin B3, check out [our ingredients Wiki] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/ingredients) as I suggested, this goes through its properties. There is 4% in the CeraVe PM lotion, you can use niacinamide morning under sunscreen or at night or both as you wish.

Cosmetic retinoids - vitamin A derivatives - are also covered in the ingredients Wiki, prescription ones are covered on the [NHS Choices site] (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Acne/Pages/Treatment.aspx) which is linked to from our sidebar. Tretinoin (Retin-A) is the most potent/ harshest of the prescription retinoids, [adapalene (Differin)] (http://www.nhs.uk/Medicine-Guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Acne&amp;medicine=Adapalene&amp;preparationAdapalene%200.1%%20cream) is the gentlest. These need to be used in very tiny amounts and build up frequency of use to avoid or minimise irritation.

Purging is when existing comedones (clogs) are rapidly brought to the surface by actives that increase skin turnover and then turn into full pimples. Basically acne can get worse before it gets better.

I can't say for sure what will work for you, there is a good deal of trial and error/ YMMV in skincare unfortunately. Including proven actives, being consistent with your routine, diet and lifestyle, feeding back to the prescribing doctor give you the best chance of success.

You can get plenty of vitamin C from a balanced and varied diet that consistently meets or exceeds ALL our government's recommendations for healthy living. *At least* five 80g servings of fruit and veggies a day in the full rainbow of bright and dark colours is recommended by UK experts, but many countries now advocate seven to nine more in line with the published research. This is do-able but means beginning with a couple of servings at breakfast not leaving it all to your evening meal!

On SCA UK we do not recommend randomly supplementing micronutrients individually or in small groups without the advice of a registered dietician or other healthcare professional who knows your medical history. You can do more harm than good upsetting the delicate balance, nutrient dense wholefoods as recommended by our government's nutrition experts are safer and often more effective.

For skin health some evidence suggests that antioxidants/ vitamins applied to the skin are complementary to those taken in the diet. For sun protection at least topical ones mostly act on the upper layers of skin (epidermis) and dietary ones mostly act on the lower layers of skin (dermis).

A true level above in my opinion, and I believe that some of this, the amount is debatable, can be attributed to playing/training with Suarez. Suarez, for me, has played the largest part in Sterlings development, and being arguable one of the top3-5 attackers in the world it's understandable that your genius would help others thrive.


But back to your questions: 1) Yes, spending more time in the first team definitely played a part, and not only that the team that's Sterling really integrated himself into almost won the league (SAS). 2) Yes, Ibe is trying a little too hard, and I truly believe Ibe will never suffer form lack of effort. He just needs a world class level attacker to learn from.

A lot of people have been talking about how it was simply the fear that she would have a stroke and become bed-bound but when you read the article it's pretty clear she had a huge desire to not be seen as a burden to others and she had a very negative view of old people in this way. It really does seem like the thing that motivated her primarily was her age and the stigma she (and society) attaches to it as she grows even older.

There's no mention of a family history of strokes so no idea where you got that from. My point is that this logic is deadly, to say she should cash out before something 'may' happen to her is nonsensical. 

Our entire medical system is built around alleviating suffering to the utmost of our ability whilst still valuing life. This woman didn't value her life and I think she could have with counselling, the more times I re-read it I realise the sheer enormity her life has put on her. She cared for others and saw people go through hell and back because of her job, coupled with the tragic death of her friend, if anybody is completely sound of mind after that I'd be shocked. 

Seems to me she must have been emotionally drained and intensely pessimistic (who wouldn't be with what she's been through) and she really did just want to commit suicide. 

Instead of talking about what a tragedy that is and how much life she could have had left to live and perhaps get some help and rekindle some hope and optimism this comment section is full of admiration for her, like she's a courageous hero instead of a victim.

However, it's much easier to drop one side of a joint degree and carry on than it is to start, say, Aerospace Engineering and then decide you want to drop it entirely and do Civil Engineering. If you're torn, start a dual honours degree if you can!

Either way, you can't start a degree then choose what modules you want to study from across the faculty. You'll be limited, with the occasional cross-discipline choice. Also, most of the choices and specialisms tend to come at the *end* of the degree. Years 1 and 2 usually have the most compulsory subjects. I didn't get to choose a single subject until I got into my 4th year after my year abroad!  

Go to a uni's 'course finder' page, and look for their programmes that involve 'engineering'. If it says 'and', it usually means a 50/50 split between the 2 disciplines, if it says 'with' it usually means about a 66/33 split.

I did an LLB in 'Law with French', and did about 1/3 French, but still did a compulsory year abroad as part of the degree.

You could actually *start* a degree in, say, 'Mechanical Engineering with a Year in Industry' or '...with a year abroad', then get to your second year and decide you don't want to do the additional third year. This is usually fine, and it's easier to *drop* the extra year than it is to apply to do it once you've started the degree.

Good luck! And don't pay too much heed to the online rankings. All of the Russell Group are respected universities, though some have better Engineering facilities.

Use their 'course finder' tools, and see what modules the different programmes offer. You might not get much choice once you start the degree, but you can usually see exactly what you'll be studying on each programme.

Sorry this is a bit long, but it's a completely different system, and there are ways to game it to give you the most choice and flexibility.

 The idea that we could be able to focus on a particular industry and use it as the basis for our entire economy is just fantasy. Strategic Trade Theory which this idea is called has shown to have from negative to negligible effects on the economy as a whole. In addition to that, the principle of comparative advantage means that our economy will naturally focus around and export the goods that we are best at, even if other people are better at it.

He could legislate to remove the restrictions for RBS and wait for it to return to profitability but I guess the view is that the risks of waiting outweigh the financial benefits of receiving the income now (one assumes that less interest to pay, slightly lower debt, slightly lower deficit are all part of the calculation).

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"That's not the point. One of the reasons the share price remains low is that the government owns too much of it, so many investment groups/hedge funds/pensions won't touch it (they have internal rules on not investing in anything where there is a &gt;50% or 66% shareholder or where a public entity owns more than x%).

Thus the government need to free up some of their shares to open up the market. They release the first tranche to lower their equity, and a few more investors become interested. Release a few more, and their pool grows again.

The reason they've sold to institutions, not direct to retail is two-fold.

Firstly, if they want to put them onto the stock-market retail, they need a partner to float those new shares out. This costs money - on shares they're already making a loss on. Instead, they can just quietly sit down and sell some shares across the table with the sorts of institutions that can afford them and not have to pay a commission or anything. They keep the total sale income.

Secondly, retail investors buy shares and sit on them, waiting for the dividend or for the share price to rise. That is the *exact* opposite of what RBS needs right now. They want those shares floating out to big investors who will buy/sell/trade those shares and generally create a bit of interest in RBS on the markets.

What they haven't done is just dump everything on the market. If you want to buy RBS shares then you can - there are shares available for retail, but this block of shares has been sold straight into institutions who will then trade them down the line.",null,0,null,1438694000,null,null,false,0,ctr1g86,null,t3_3fpy8q,null,null,null,t1_ctqxmfa,null,null,null,1440273317,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"That's not the point. One of the reasons the share price remains low is that the government owns too much of it, so many investment groups/hedge funds/pensions won't touch it (they have internal rules on not investing in anything where there is a &gt;50% or 66% shareholder or where a public entity owns more than x%).

Thus the government need to free up some of their shares to open up the market. They release the first tranche to lower their equity, and a few more investors become interested. Release a few more, and their pool grows again, each tranche commanding a higher price than the last.

The reason they've sold to institutions, not direct to retail is two-fold.

Firstly, if they want to put them onto the stock-market retail, they need a partner to float those new shares out. This costs money - on shares they're already making a loss on. Instead, they can just quietly sit down and sell some shares across the table with the sorts of institutions that can afford them and not have to pay a commission or anything. They keep the total sale income.

Secondly, retail investors tend to buy shares and sit on them, waiting for the dividend or for the share price to rise. That is the exact opposite of what RBS needs right now. They want those shares floating out to big investors who will buy/sell/trade those shares and generally create a bit of interest in RBS on the markets.

With the government owning the % they did, shares were NEVER going to get anywhere near the 502p the government paid for them, because that % excludes some of the biggest institutional investors and traders. The government has to shift a few of them off - at a loss - to make the company attractive to some of the big investors.

We're behind Arsenal at the moment in terms of revenue growth/self sustainability but their continued 4th place finish was off the back of winning the league 3 times in 6 seasons where we're coming off the back of finishing in and around 4th-8th. 

Wenger right now is well respected and can attract players on his own but that's because he's been in football longer than Rodgers has been alive (BR was 11 when Wenger was starting his managerial career). He'll get there eventually, right now we need to sit tight and be content with trying to pick up players who aren't necessarily desirable (Coutinho, Sturridge etc) and turning them into the type of player they are today. Soon enough we'll be a self-sustainable club with revenues increasing to help aid the purchase or ""marquee"" signings. Right now we're doing nice business and challenging for top 4. 

The difference between Arsenal back then and us right now is the emergence of Chelsea and more recently City. The top 4 essentially picked itself for a fair few years (2000-2010 we finished outside the top 4 3 times), and right now we can't expect to finish above teams that are spending £200m a season with massive wages, it's just out of pure grit, determination and team spirit that we're going to dislodge one of the top 4 teams this season.

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"Those shares will NEVER hit the pre-crash price under the current regime.

Many big institutions have rules about risk - the government owns too much of it, so many investment groups/hedge funds/pensions won't touch it. They have internal rules on not investing in anything where there is a &gt;50% or 66% shareholder or where a public entity owns more than x%.

Thus the government need to free up some of their shares to open up the market. They release the first tranche to lower their equity, and a few more investors become interested. Release a few more, and their pool of potential buyers grows again, increasing demand and thus the share price.

The reason they've sold to institutions, not direct to retail is two-fold.

Firstly, if they want to put them onto the stock-market retail, they need a partner to float those new shares out. This costs money - on shares they're already making a loss on. Instead, they can just quietly sit down and sell some shares across the table with the sorts of institutions that can afford them and not have to pay a commission or anything. They keep the total sale income.

Secondly, retail investors buy shares and sit on them, waiting for the dividend or for the share price to rise. That is the exact opposite of what RBS needs right now. They want those shares floating out to big investors who will buy/sell/trade those shares and generally create a bit of interest in RBS on the markets.

The other thing is not all the money is coming via RBS share sales. For instance, RBS are farming 600 branches out into a new bank called Williams &amp; Glyn. Obviously that will impact their share price because they're now a smaller company. But there will be a big chunk of income when people buy William &amp; Glyn shares, so you're selling n RBS shares at a lower price, but also selling y W&amp;G shares for some amount of money (which is all profit - since they didn't exist before!). Will it break even? Probably not, but they're not cutting a 40% loss - they're making back the money through a complex collection of sell-offs and spin-offs, as well as selling actual RBS shares.",null,0,null,1438694579,null,null,false,0,ctr1pmk,null,t3_3fpy8q,null,null,null,t1_ctqwrs5,null,null,null,1440273440,null,-1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

null,null,sartorResartus,null,null,null,"There is unquestionably a credible argument that the EPR is a lame duck.  But there are two issues

- The EPR is already a stick for the Green-Luddites to beat nuclear with.  A climbdown must not be a further PR loss.  Unfortunately, Corbyn, with his old school CND baggage, has his one intellectual blind-spot on nuclear energy, so anti-nuclearism might not be a trait limited to fringe politics for much longer.  This makes a rational debate and possibly a climb-down and change to an alternate design difficult.  

- Generic Design Authorization by the ONR is a lengthy process and only the EPR, AP1000 and ABWR are approved alternatives.  There's a strong argument to say that the ONR should accept US or other national regulators' certifications.  The Koreans can build APC-1000s far cheaper than the EPR - in our money roughly 1/3rd the strike price of Hinkley, all things being equal.  Of approved designs, the Hitachi ABWR is definitely the strongest contender having a track record of coming in under-budget and on-schedule in Japan (but not in China).  GE-Hitachi should (if DECC and the ONR are clueful) also get approval to build a PRISM breeder reactor at Sellafield this year.  

PRISM is a very under-appreciated but crucial project, as it represents the last hope for a Western breeder reactor program.  The Russians, Indians and particularly the Chinese are extremely serious about their breeder programs.  As well as burning waste, PRISM is a small modular reactor - and ""small"" is a good sales attribute when proposing new nuclear.  Yet it would be ready only by 2025 at the earliest - not an alternative for Hinkley.  However, more reactors from the same vendor simplifies procurement.  All these points, to me are in favour of the ABWR.

But all things aren't equal because of the business environment.  Specifically the massive political uncertainties hanging over Hinkley because of the EU Commission's prostration to the Germans and their desperation to uphold the credibility of the Energiewende project - which ultimately rests upon the argument that nuclear is dead.  New nuclear build in any member state threatens German credibility - hence the delaying lawsuits and propaganda war from venal Luddite fanatic NGOs, often linked to the renewable industry.  Time cost of money would have driven up the price of any alternative to the EPR if built in the UK for this reason.",null,0,null,1438694898,null,null,1438695278,0,ctr1uxo,null,t3_3fpv43,null,null,null,t3_3fpv43,null,null,null,1440273509,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Series 1 Episode 1 is called rose (for the 2005 run of the show)   Series 2 episode 1 is the Christmas Invasion 
Series 5 episode 1 is called The Eleventh Hour  
Series 8 Episode 1 is called deep breath 

These are the first episodes for the 4 doctors who we have seen since the 2005 run of the show started.  I like to tell people to watch those because its actually an introduction to the doctor's new face. For someone who has no idea about doctor who or very little it helps sometimes. 

There are some good stand alone episodes as well you can watch. 

Season 1 

-Empty Child/Doctor Dances (2 part episode) 

-The Unquiet Dead

Season 2

-Tooth and Claw
(OH and special note...Skip love and monsters on this episode...bad episode just skip it just trust me) 

Season 3

-Runaway Bride

-Smith and Jones

-Blink

Season 4

-Partners in Crime

-Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (2 parter) 

Season 5

-Eleventh Hour

-Vincent and the Doctor (The Van Gogh episode you mentioned) 

-The Lodger

Season 6

-The Doctor's Wife

-Closing Time

These are all fun episodes to get you into it...a good crossection of all of the Doctor's diffrent regenerations and all that...

Mainly because seeing corruption and crime is part of the job. I mean they deal with this sort of thing every day. I've seen policemen be able to identify who was lying just by looking at their faces. They can tell if someone is up to something.

Greece is not in default. At this point they have no outstanding debts. You might be able to claim that Greece is de facto insolvent, but that's a different thing, and for now Greece has not defaulted. The IMF got their payment, late by a few weeks but they got it.

Back your claim up. Show me who they are defaulting with, and for how much. If you're using default as a justification for suspending the democratic norms of a country and having “political power” to the ECB then show me who they defaulted too, how much etc. “For all intents and purposes” is semantic game-playing. They are either defaulting on their debts or they aren't - which is it?

null,null,RushedFowl,lfc55,,null,"Reasons why I think Henderson should start over Can:

In a side with a very young average age, having the partnership of Henderson and Milner in front of the two central defenders is a great thing to have. Can has his tendency - as a box to box midfielder - to make great marauding runs but has trouble tracking back. We saw it last year when he was playing on the left side of defence when he would get caught high up the field and they would break up the side he was meant to be marking. I think he needs a year or two more to develop discipline and learn when to make those runs and when to sit and hold.  

We are likely going to be playing with a 4-2-3-1 diamond next season. Last season one of the things I noticed was the tendency for the midfield to become crowded and we would end up passing it within a 10 sq yard box before being closed down. Whilst the two central midfielders won't be expected to sit back and hold the whole match, they will likely rotate roles - one goes forward and one stays further back. I wouldn't be comfortable yet leaving Can as a lone holding midfielder from what I saw last year of his defensive awareness, he was often beaten down the line which was the attacker's only option and other times made rash decisions in the box.  

I think there's a place for him in the midfield, definitely. But at this moment I'd have Henderson and Milner starting all day long. Henderson is the more complete player - Can has flashes of brilliance.",null,0,null,1438696972,null,null,false,0,ctr2w48,null,t3_3fqw86,null,null,null,t3_3fqw86,null,null,null,1440273996,null,2,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

A consultant? Do you know how long and how much work it takes to make consultant? 

That's like suggesting it is okay to pay 80 grand for football classes because Sergio Aguero earns 80 grand a week. 

Consultant is like the apex of your career. It's tough to become one. 

And it is still an extra cost. I mean if I dumped £4000 as an extra cost for a student it's a sizeable amount of money. 

It doesn't matter that the loan is manageable, what matters is the fact that Medical Students have the highest debt and there has been no increase in Junior doctor salaries to compensate. 

I repeat. That same F1 5 years ago would pay off that loan a lot faster. Read my lips. 

This is one thing Asians learn quickly. We have a pathological fear of loans for a reason (Asian slavery was based on loans so most Asians don't like them). 

Once that tuition was 2K plus 3K maintainance. 25 grand. Let's assume you scraped through on 60K. That's a net extra payment of 35K that doctors never had to pay before. 

Saying ""I don't care, you guys earn a tonne of money later on"" assumes doctors jobs are just sexy parties 24/7. Not enormous responsibility that justifies the pay. 

It's okay you can easily pay off 30K is not acceptable. It's enough money for three second hand cars or two new ones. It's a downpayment on a house. It's money that could go to our kids. 

30 K is a lot of money  that hasn't been compensated. Just because the loan's nice and easy to pay doesn't still make it a drain that didn't exist before.

You're confusing causality and consequence here. RBS's value dropped so they had to downsize to focus on their core activities, not the other way round. Most of the downsizing has been announced over the past few years [1](http://fortune.com/2015/03/03/rbs-layoffs-investment-banking/) [2](http://investorplace.com/2014/02/rbs-stock-royal-bank-of-scotland/#.VcDG8vmqqko), far after its shared plummeted. In fact, in the past three years despite downsizing RBS shares have risen by 150%.

&gt; So yeah, the share price went down, but the bank is more stable than it has been for a good long time, and it's returning to profitability. What's the problem exactly?

If it does return to profitability that's great, but there's no guarantee of it.

That's disingenuous. Labour support has been dropping ever since the GE. Conservatives went up to 39% support a week after the general election.

I don't know what the fuck the other guy is talking about with regards to the possibility of Corbyn winning the GE, but GE polling doesn't indicate anything at the moment.

In these polls, people are asked ""If there was a general election tomorrow, who would you vote for"". The Labour party is currently going through an identity crisis and is without a leader, that only the core supporters would vote Labour at the moment is only to be expected. This is coupled by the fact that the party looks especially disunited what with all the conflict and the lack of agreement on the welfare bill.

Her explanation was this.  You set your ""aspiration target"" for the year.  This might be (to use the example) trying to get 300 people in that year to stop smoking by getting them onto NRT.

At the end of the year, you submit your actual numbers for each metric and you achieve the QOF point(s) for that year if you met or exceeded your target.  For SMOK003, there are only two points available in that year.  There are other things in the SMOK*** section which are worth more points.  

The number of points achieved are tallied up and put into a system called CQRS (not sure what that stands for) and the points are calculated against your practice size for how much you will actually get.  For her practice, it's nowhere near as much as £300 for every patient signposted to smoking cessation advice - for an entire year, for all smoking cessation services, she says the practice will get a few thousand (less than ten thousand).

null,null,banbourg,null,null,null,"**Grading:** Your overall degree class - the only grade that matters - is determined by the average of your exam results. You will of course get to see the grade you got on each individual paper (so people will commonly say ""X got a first in Micro""), but they don't matter in the wider scheme of things. You certainly wouldn't list individual grades on your CV. 

**Recruitment:** Almost all graduate employers in the UK, MBB included, look for 2:1s and above. A 1 is better -- but is nowhere near as important as the quality of your university, internship and extra-curriculars. These are what will separate one 2:1 from another 2:1. Also remember that if you intend to follow the usual UK application cycle (which takes place Oct-May in third year), you would be interviewing and getting an offer before you even took your final exams.

**Exams:**
Sorry, I'm still a bit baffled by this one. These are university exams, not a high school pop quiz! :) The aim is, as you say, not just to list definitions, but to demonstrate your knowledge of the complex interplay of theoretical models we use to describe and analyse economies, and to show that you have a well thought-through opinion on the assumptions each of them makes. Of course, in order to do this competently, you'll have to learn the right jargon and how each model works, but the exams are really not about straight regurgitation.


**Fit:** One key thing - let's separate aptitude from enjoyment. You'll perform better if you're happy, so if you *enjoy* quant stuff and *hate* writing, maybe consider a more quant degree - either in a more mathsy econ setting (e.g. at LSE) or in one of the hard sciences. In the UK, the prestige of your university matters a lot more than your actual degree for most entry-level corporate jobs, so this will not impact your ability to find a great position (incl. in consulting) in the UK.

On the other hand, written and oral communication skills are very important in a professional services setting. The tutorial model will play to your strengths if you're good at presentation, but you're too young to treat your weaknesses as a given - and an essay-heavy degree would be a great opportunity to develop those skills.

null,null,themeds,null,null,null,"See your point on this, but disagree with most of your examples from other teams given we are talking about 2nd strikers here. 

Benteke - probably the fairest comparison. Would in theory be a second striker to a fit Sturridge. Strong, quick, hungry and offers something different due to his stature and skill. Has been a bit inconsistent however, seems to go through purple patches. In summary, I would probably rate him over Remy by a hair due to his age.

Aguero - undisputed 1st choice for City and best striker in the prem. Comparisons should be made to Costa, not Remy.

Depay - AM / Winger. Not a striker

Benzema - not going to be at Arsenal if you believe todays quotes from Benitez / RM, which I for one do. There seems to be this speculation every season but he never moves. Why would he?

Giroud - again probably their 1st choice, so Welbeck would be a better comparison. But if comparing him to Giroud I personally would go for Remy for his pace. 

In summary, i would say that Liverpool's strike force are probably the most balanced in this comparison. But then the vast majority of their team is not at the same level of Chelsea, Arsenal, United and City so not something to be to concerned about.

I personally think we have the second best strikeforce out of the 'top 4' with only City trumping us, so dont think there is really cause for concern in this regard. 

1 - City: Aguero, Bony, Dzeko
2 - Chelsea: Costa, Remy, Falcao, Traore (if needed)
3 - United: Rooney, Depay (as he was mentioned)
4 - Arsenal: Giroud, Welbeck, Walcott

Frankly its a tough call for me between United and Arsenal, given that United only really have one out and out striker but Rooney on his day is head and shoulders above any of the Arsenal strikers in my opinion so I think they just about take it due to that. I would say there is clear daylight between City and us at 1st/2nd compared to United and Arsenal at 3rd/4th

null,null,not_hokusai_,lfc99,,null,"A quick reply which would have otherwise been buried underneath a comment supporting this article:


1) Transfers

If anything Rodgers has more control now over transfers, not less. Benteke has been a Rodgers target for 2 seasons and we just spent £30m on him. If the owners weren't confident in his spending ability would they be backing him up like that? Calling Joe Allen a transfer failure at £15m is only indicative of the extreme irrational dislike the author has for Rodgers in that he is willing to write off a perfectly decent squad player on perfectly decent wages merely for the fact Rodgers signed him. According to this Rodgers would have preferred Bertrand to Moreno. I like Moreno, but the case could definitely be made that Bertrand had a better season with Southampton than Moreno had with us, I certainly think he is the stronger defensively.

2) Ego

This section is completely unfounded. Author doesn't like his personality. Fair enough. Not a valid reason to criticise his managerial ability. Using quotes which fail to consider the context they were originally used in and ignore the context of last season prior to which we lost arguably the best striker in the world and had our second best striker ruled out through injury. The £100m quote in particular is unfair, fails to consider net spend, relative wage budgets of clubs, a whole host of complexities. Of course it's a bit silly of Rodgers to say it in the first place but shoving it in his face when our net spend was actually closer to £36m is plain stupid. Pinning poor team performances on something the manager said in the pre-match press conference is even more idiotic. It's a team game, guys.

3) Defence

 &gt;   Had Rodgers consistently started with Sakho and Manquillo as opposed to Lovren and Johnson, our defensive record would certainly have improved no matter how little or large.

Pure speculation. It's not a fair point to make from my perspective but who was the CB pairing on the last day of the season against Stoke? Sakho and Skrtel. Rodgers sees his players on a daily basis and is well within his rights to have preferred options, even if sometimes the fans don't see the reasons for that.

Also, paraphrasing:

 &gt;   Johnson got too much playing time, shouldn't have been near the pitch, but why did he not play the last game?!?!?!

Duh-doi.

4)

Umm.... Ok?

5) Man Management

Surprise surprise, people who were not in the manager's plans didn't get on with him very well. Also:

&gt;    It seems rather coincidental that since Rodgers’ arrival, many big names and influences within the team have departed. These include Reina, Agger, Carragher, Kuyt and most recently Steven Gerrard. The remaining influential characters are Kolo Toure and Lucas Leiva, who Rodgers has actually tried to get rid of in the past.

Reina was on a huge wage packet and had some pretty poor performances; Agger was unfortunately torn apart by injuries; Carragher retired and had always planned to, even pretty sure he admitted he regretted not staying another season; Kuyt left 2 days after Rodgers joined when Fenerbahce met his release clause; and let's be honest, Gerrard could no longer cope with the pace of the premier league game and wanted to play week in, week out, which Rodgers rightly couldn't provide him.

Also ignores the many players who have come out in praise of Rodgers man management, I'll just leave this here:

 &gt;   You go out feeling full of confidence and belief. His one-on-one management is the best I've known.

    Steven Gerrard on Rodgers' management.

Article also uses Mignolet as an example. One of the better pieces of man management Rodgers demonstrated last season was pulling Mignolet out of the firing line, giving him a bit of a spell out of the limelight and allowing him to find his confidence without the pressure of the media on him on a weekly basis.

To be honest this completely sums up the article:

  &gt;  I could go into detail but it would simply take too long.

Translates more closely to

  &gt;  I could go into detail but my argument would buckle under the weight of its own hypocrisy and sheer idiocy.

I do not have a car as a medical student. That's in a fairly rural area, too. Not central Manchester or London or Birmingham, or even Leeds or Nottingham. You can get by without. That said, if you want a car then yes the option is there. I know people who had cars without taking out extra loans -- they're not nice cars, but they function.

You ignored my point RE: consultants. That was the height of my example; I'm not saying it's easy from that point on. I'm saying the maximum you will ever pay back a month is less than £370, even on the highest wage bracket.

At F1, £160 is acceptable. It is not unpayable. Would it be nice to have the extra £160? Yes. But that is a similar position to *every other graduate, regardless of discipline*. And doctors are much better placed to pay off that £160 than, say, an arts graduate or even a biomedical scientist over the long term.

I never said to be frivolous with loans, but to make out that between £160-370 a month is life-ending is ridiculous. It simply isn't.

It looks good when it comes off, but if it doesn't it will result in a yellow, goal, or goal scoring opportunity.

Do you take his shaky moments in possession because he brings excellent defense, or do you take Lovren who looks a bit better in distribution with worse defense.  Obviously, for me Sakho is the way to go.  

Maybe Rodgers doesn't like the injury record of Sakho and sees that as the biggest threat to his backline not Lovren's defensive frailities.  Maybe Rodgers expects a  Skrtel downfall this year and wants both to have game time, so he can go to a Lovren/Sakho backline which could easily end up our best pairing.",null,0,null,1438699869,null,null,false,0,ctr4j0o,null,t3_3fo8gb,null,null,null,t3_3fo8gb,null,null,null,1440274767,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

null,null,Arctic_Fax,null,null,null,"I worked at a US uni (Duke) for a bit as a post doc. Two things about work loads:

Work ethic in the US is much much higher, I put this mostly down to the tuition fees, simply put most american students are taking a serious financial hit to go to university. Maybe only 20% of students in the UK actually work 40 hours a week for subjects with lecture based teaching, its actually a bit of a joke I think. A lot of people are happy to scrape a 2.1, in the US most people are going all out, the US is much more competitive in general though, and this 100% carries on into University.

The other thing I put this down to is the amount the courses are structured, in the UK the staff will help you if you ask but most courses (with some notable exceptions like engineering and medicine) have lectures, some tutorials and large amounts of independent study. This gives you many more opportunities to work less, also there's no 8am or 6pm lectures in the UK, its almost always 9-5. The US is far more structured with constant tests and quizzes etc. if you start to drop they notice and you get told you're slipping so you can get up to the standard required. You don't tend to have that in the UK. I don't think either is easier, but basically the US system is on your back way more, in the UK you can set yourself adrift do no work for 6 months and really fuck up badly!

Personally (and I realise I am biased) I think the UK system is better, it really relies on the student to motivate themselves and is much better at equipping you for the world of work, the US is considerably more spoonfed, no one really fails at it, you either do well, or very well, in the UK we're much more into the stick approach than the carrot!",null,0,null,1438701407,null,null,false,0,ctr5gtk,null,t3_3fpvda,null,null,null,t1_ctqyzwt,null,null,null,1440275216,null,3,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

I don’t feel comfortable about jumping off the fence in terms of the “securing peace”/”peace at any price” debate but in terms of strategic value the carpet bombing of German cities did have a military value. This was, after all, a *total war*; the strategic value of a destroyed city goes well beyond the number of lives lost. 

Consider the following as consequences of the bombings: destruction of war production, the massive disruption to national economic activity, the loss of skilled and unskilled workforce, the ammunition and fuel spent on AA fire and intercepting fighters, the cost of rebuilding, the cost of providing care for refugees, the strain among transport networks, the chaos and confusion this spreads - all of this stresses the war economy and taxes the material resources and manpower of the bombed nation. Throughout the war Germany was outclassed at sea by the Royal Navy and their war economy was increasingly dependent on European land conquest, which was eventually halted and gradually rolled back; every bullet, every shell, every drop of oil and every kilogram of steel consumed by their armed forces and support networks cost them more than the same would for the Allies – this is the grim mathematics of total war, where carpet bombing cities into oblivion matters more for the resources it forces your enemy to spend than it does for the lives lost. 

Basically, WW2 was really fucking nasty and there were no angels among the field and air marshalls, nor the admiralties of any nation. ",null,0,null,1438702181,null,null,false,0,ctr5yr5,null,t3_3fpssb,null,null,null,t1_ctr4vr8,null,null,null,1440275450,null,5,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

City have strengthened their attack with Sterling. It looks like they are going to play a single striker system this season so it will be interesting to see how they adapt to it. Their defense hasn't looked like it's improved, in fact it's probably gotten worse with the players being a year older. Delph might be key to protecting their defense though. They played a match in pre season with Delph, Fernandinho and Toure and it made Toure look much better in a 3 man midfield as Delph tracked back for him which gave him a more free role. I think lots of goals on both ends of the pitch for them.

I'm an Arsenal fan so won't comment on them.

I think United will be much more defensively solid this year. They didn't improve their CB's but around them they have better more defensive players. Looks like they will be playing with 2 DM's in Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger. This will give their defense a lot of protection. The thing that I think will let them down is their attack. They struggled for creativity last season and drew a lot of games. It now looks like they will be selling their most creative player (Di Maria) which will make it worse. Also, Schneiderlin came from Southampton who also struggled with creativity and it looks like United will be playing him in the same role.

&gt;It is not as if he had just signed a new contract only to negate on it. He wasn't getting any younger, and Levy was obviously planning to keep him. 

He fulfilled two years of a new six-year contract, I'd say that his contract wasn't that old. You're damn right Levy was obviously planning on keeping him, he signed a SIX YEAR contract with Spurs. If his form fell off and he was sitting on the bench all that time, he still would have been paid.  That's fine to expect the club to commit for the duration of the contract, but not for the player??  

&gt;Do you have the same anger towards Bale? Because he did the exact same thing. Only difference is that he was in the first year of his new four year contract. 

Almost, but that's just because he personally wasn't as public about it. I give him credit for that portion at least, but otherwise I'm done with Bale as well.

I'm Mancunian, but I have been living in Los Angeles for the past few years and have made the trip a couple of times.  It's been expensive from here, a couple of thousand dollars in airfare, but I'm pretty committed to flying British Airways at this stage in my life and have a longer flight, so I'd think you could find much cheaper from NYC if you're more flexible than I am on which airline you fly.  I always fly to Manchester Airport via Heathrow, but again, other airlines may be more direct.

You could fly into other airports but do consider that petrol/gas tends to be *much* more expensive in the UK and rail fares can vary wildly from extortionate to cheap as chips, so flying into Manchester is probably your best bet.

For places to stay I can usually stay with friends, but if you don't know anyone in the area, I'd just suggest shopping around for deals on places to stay.  I like the Radisson Edwardian, but sometimes it's quite expensive and I wouldn't say it's so nice that you *have* to stay there.  My only proper suggestion is think twice before booking the Hilton.  The building is cool and you'll probably get a nice view from your room but that's where they put up guests for the Jeremy Kyle show (something akin to The Jerry Springer Show), so ask yourself if you really want to be surrounded by the kind of people that think the best way to resolve their outlandish problems is to appear on national television.  If you want to check out the views you could just go to their bar instead.

As for getting tickets, it's pretty well covered in the FAQ, but the shitter the opponent the better your chance of getting tickets.  One think I don't mention in the FAQ is hit up your local supporter's group (I understand the Mad Hatter has a good Man City community) since they can often help with ticketing.",null,0,null,1438702211,null,null,false,0,ctr5zf7,null,t3_3fr3rk,null,null,null,t3_3fr3rk,null,null,null,1440275459,null,6,null,MCFC,t5_2s14k,6,null

null,null,CallidusUK,null,null,null,"Absolutely. Modern football rarely omits the fierce loyalty and personality that was shown by players like Duncan Ferguson. 

This testimonial truly brought this reality home to me. When I heard the fans singing the Duncan Ferguson song, I couldn't help but feel the hairs raise on my arms, long lost feelings from a decade ago. I still remember the moment Duncan was sold to Newcastle against his wishes. When he openly said that he had no willingness to ever leave our club and the financial reasons trumped his own. It was a man who was truly only loyal to one club.  

His passion on the pitch, his energy and love of our club was unfathomable to all. Even when our club lacked quality and we sat at the lower ends of the league, having a player like big dunc in the ranks was a very reassuring presence. 

Sometimes I forget though the mindset of a player. It's easy to assume that a foreign player like Lukaku for example, can turn up and suddenly feel the same emotions as I do when I think of our club. But that won't ever be the case. 

My connection with Everton stem from my dad taking me the games as a kid, the banter in school with liverpool fans, decades of ups and downs with all kind of emotions that a foreign player has no true connection with. They have their own story, their own emotions that football means for them.

They arrive to the foreign land, sign the contract and strive for glory. Man city turn up, and show interest in you? Guess what, more money, more chance to be winning trophies, more world exposure and boom, Everton is a memory. 

I understand this. I do. But if you're a player, who plays for Everton. I truly hope you grasp your situation right now in that you're playing for one of the greatest teams in England in arguably the greatest league in the world and your financial situation is in the top 1% of this planet. And if you show our club this club loyalty, and openly fight for this club like our man Big dunc. You will become immortalised. Many players will come and go on this planet, many that where leagues better than Duncan Ferguson ever was. But you know what? Dunc's personality and loyalty has guaranteed his place in Everton history. He'll forever be in scripture, museums and the like. Only a few days ago his name sung high from thousands like a gladiatorial arena and the crowd roared like a goal was scored for him simply getting his head on the ball. This is glory, and this is all for offer to any player who puts on the royal blue shirt. And what is the price? 

Loyalty. Simply loyalty. Openly telling the media that you would never leave your club, striving to bring trophies to a club/fan base that idolise your passion, athleticism and ability week in and week out. And not abusing the emotions of those who are lesser fortunate, who pay large sums of money to follow you and strive to witness their team grow and become the best they can be. In the dressing room, roaring like a lion when the side is playing like shit. Nil Satis Nisi Optimum! The passion to not simply be content in mid table football, but to be demanding the league and instilling that vision to your fellow teammates. If you as an Everton player, integrate such a plan into your way of life, your reward is immortality within the ranks of our history and our club has shown time and time again that it remembers those who chose the Everton way.

Maybe because many of his policies are crazy and unrealistic?

Yvette Cooper is Labours only chance. She's left wing enough to appeal to the base. She's also sensible enough to pull in the floating, centrist voters.

Kendall is slightly too far to the right. Burnham has zero personality.

Corbyn kinda appeals to the hearts of left wingers, but he has absolutely ZERO chance of winning a general election. While he might make some people feel good for voting for a guy who is super nice, wants to tax the rich and the evil corporations and then give it all to the poor people in the world etc etc, it just isn't workable in the UK in 2015 (or in 2020).

If Corbyn ends up as Labour leader, he will be attacked constantly. He will be battered in the election and we will end up with a Tory majority government. Some people seem to believe that there are millions of people who are passionately left wing and simply don't vote, and if only Labour picks this guy, all of those people are going to come out and propel them to victory.

Unfortunately many grads have trouble landing that first job so I'm sure future you would appreciate this. In my eyes the other option (the one I would go with if I could do it all again) would be to use this money to get the most out of your college experience.

null,null,grahampeterclark,null,null,null,"My first question would be to determine any inheritance tax liabilities. Is your £110k after any possible inheritance taxes have been settled?

Good work on building up your emergency fund for university living. I would personally hold onto that additional £10k in a guaranteed return, instant access account (maybe a cash ISA or current account / savings account that pays some small interest), as you may need it through university, especially if your parents do not cover all costs and you don't intent to take out a loan or get a job in the meantime.

For the 100k, my decision would depend on where I'm going to university and whether this was close to (a) home or (b) where I intend to live in the future. You need to have a long conversation with your financial advisor, but equally need to have weighed up the pros and cons, and risks, of:

* keeping it in cash (or cash equivalent) until you finish university
* invest some of it in higher returning products (such as equities) with the expectation that you will not be buying property until at least after you've finished uni (could be up to 5 years depending on your plans)
* possibility of buying property whilst at uni (and renting to housemates), maybe in a shared agreement with parents
* about a hundred other possibilities...

You'll also have to consider tax implications of all your approaches.

null,null,GTARoadRager,null,null,null,"Agreed.  But Messi gets man-marked by fluff La Liga defenders.  Hazard is getting mauled out there on a weekly basis by some of the grittiest players on this planet.  I'd like to see Messi come over to England and play in Stoke in late December and see how he holds up then.  I'm not completely sold on his mystique--yet.  Your comment about the predictability is spot on.  Hence that is where I mentioned that Mourinho will either make adjustments to his lineup or simply let the form come back to these guys.  In terms of RB, I believe that Ivanovic still needs quite a bit more time to return to form.  He's not that swashbuckling 26 year old fullback that he once was, but he will be fine once he gets his legs under him once it's for three points.  Oscar's fitness is probably the reason why Ramires got so much time.  I highly doubt we'll be seeing too much Matic pairing alongside Ramires or Obi Mikel this season unless there is less than 25 minutes to go and we are trying to slam that bus into park.  Azpilicueta got burned by Oxlade-Chamberlain and it was apparent that Kurt Zouma was brought in to address the lack of pace on the left side.  I think the only real concern going forward will the (lack) of pace amongst the back four (minus Zouma) and that we are going to see the opposition really try to capitalize on this by either long-balling it or simply pushing their attackers deeper into our third to press them.   Again, pace is something Stones and Baba Rahman possess so this should only be a temporary situation.

You're a British citizen, but presumably enrolled as a French one? In that case, don't EU students qualify as home students when it comes to tuition rates and funding/loans/etc? Presumably you can fund university through whatever systems are in place for French students.

Even if your situation is more complicated than this, contact your university and the UK/French versions of student finance. They are professionals, who understand the whole of the law and rules (which, due to the French aspect, I doubt anyone here does fully).

Explain the whole situation to them in terms of finance (you're a student enrolled at the UK university, funded through whatever means, and your parents have cut you off/refused you the right to return). Ask them how you can keep studying at university - the finance companies about whether they can fund you, the university whether it has some kind of ""emergency fund"" (mine did, which several friends used) and to keep you enrolled. It might be a loan, it might be grants, but it's worth getting all the options on the table.

I'd recommend trying to patch things up with the parents. Explain how you are an adult and that means you get to make your own decisions.

Work are dragging their feet with sorting my pay out, mainly as it turns out it should have been in last months wages rather than this months.

Final straw though was being told I won't get overtime for the 7 day week I did at the start of the busy period when changing to a different shift pattern. Apparently that means I'm not entitled to it like the rest of the regular staff, even though it works out as an extra 8 hours for me. Not to mention that we were told we would be doing 12 hour shifts, 4 on 4 off, and then having our last 4 off cut down to 2 days with only a couple of hours notice, or that we were the only permanent staff to be paid the same as the temps when all the other permanents were paid more.

United's lack of strikers will come back to bite them if they don't bring someone in by the end of the window. I don't think Schweinsteiger is that great of a signing but Depay &amp; Schneiderlin are.

Gabby was at his best with a second forward to play off of, like when he was paired with Carew.  He still has pace to be dangerous but at this point should be a super sub around 70 min to go run at tired defenders.However, my biggest annoyance with the way we've used Gabby has been on corners or FK deep in our half. Gabby is an awful marker. I can't count the number of goals I've seen where his man got a free header. With that and his pace in mind, he should never come further back than the center circle. If gabby is sitting in the middle of the field, he requires two defenders. If not, a caught kick could result in an immediate counter simply by kicking to whichever side of the field the single defender isn't on and let gabby run on to it.

As the dancer's shadow falls across the keyboard you can see some feature on the right that looks like a cartridge slot, to me, as on the TI 99/4 (eg http://www.dvorak.org/blog/whatever-happened-to-the-texas-instruments-home-computer/); it's shown at 1:34 too, where you see a better view of the profile of the keyboard section.

Corby doesn't exactly set a standard of toeing the party line.  If he does get elected to labour leader he will divide the party, one camp who will follow him into the leftish night, one camp who follow his leadership directives but not engaged with it and forever be stuck in the quagmire of ""I'll say what the whips want, but spin them so I'm still a centrist"" and then the other camp who will attack, vote against, disobey his leadership directives (and it's not like he can call them out as he would look like a total hypocrite as it's exactly what he did) and mix the message that labour are trying to put across.


Point is, Corby is a left, so far to the left the centrist labour supporters will be looking around, the centrist Labour MP's will be decamped in their own plotting against him.  He's such a bad fit, he won't garner the support of the Labour party because he's at one end of the scale.

Markovic has been given many opportunities here and never been outstanding. He's been alright, and I like him but guys like Sterling last year and Ibe this preseason have been better than him and keeping him out of the team. Just because he's been to the Europa league final twice is actually fairly meaningless now that he's had a whole season here to judge him on. 

It seems like he might be more effective at central attacking midfield, instead of out wide. But we have so many attacking midfielders that he will likely never get substantial minutes there, unless he really blows us away when he does get his chance. He needs to take a page out of Hendo's book and keep his head down, work hard and impress when he gets his chance. Make himself undroppable. 

As for Moreno, I can't believe you think he hasn't been shown any faith. He's played over 2200 minutes in the premier league already. He's had plenty of opportunity to shine, and while he hasn't been bad, he's not exactly setting the league on fire. 

Moreno is prone to ball watching at the back post and letting his man get in behind. Again, I like him but Gomez looks very promising and I have no problem with him being rewarded with a starting spot on Sunday. Gomez is very young, so I have no doubt that Moreno will be back in the starting XI soon anyways.

1. Undergrad tutoring is pretty unrewarding for faculty anyway - instead of teaching (hungover, disengaged) students one on one they could hold one class and spend the rest of their time on research. So tutorials where your shit (or nonexistent) essay makes it clear that you care neither about the tutor's life passion or the fact that you're actively wasting their time are awkward for everyone. I speak from experience.

2. To your point: more often than you'd think, you'll find yourself in a situation where the lecturing prof disagrees with textbook 1, textbook 2 disagrees with both and a few of the papers you looked up in hopes of lessening your confusion claimed to agree with one of the above while actually saying something that seems substantially different. The tutorial essay may be your only opportunity to delve into the things you don't understand and get an opinion from your tutor before it comes up in the final exam.

3. Finally and most importantly: your tutors are your 'directors of studies'.

Therefore, arguably, if you are liable for the full rent your guarantor is also liable for the full rent.

I say arguably because the wording is terrible and a simple reading would suggest the exact opposite; that the guarantor is only guaranteeing a portion of the rent.  As a general principle where an agreement is ambiguous the court should interpret it in the way that is most favourable to the party that didn't draft it, which in this case would mean in favour of the guarantor.

So I reckon this could go either way in court.

Because the outcome of any political discussion generally depends on how the conversation is framed. 

If you have two people arguing - one person calling for tough austerity and one calling for diet austerity, then the premise of this discussion is that austerity is fine, and the argument is reduced to how best to carry it out.

If you have one person who's pro-austerity and one who's anti-austerity the whole nature of the discussion is different. Instead of taking austerity for granted as a good thing, they have to justify it, which totally changes the nature of the debate.

The role of the newspapers is to shape the limits of acceptable debate - having someone like Corbyn threatens to expand the limits of respectable opinion and changes the nature of the entire political debate. 

It's in the Tories interest to find a Labour candidate that tacitly accepts the legitimacy of Tory policy, not someone who might challenge it.

At home or out it would be beer. A good real ale, I like to try ones I haven't seen before. A local one if I am travelling. I prefer ale on draught but bottles of ale are acceptable or a decent strong lager - I like the Polish ones like Tyskie or Zywiec. I don't get on well with gassy pissy ones like Fosters or Stella. 

Wine, white or red. Has to be at least half decent, the cheap bottles are probably what put people off wine for life. Anything over a tenner a bottle would be very extravagant for me but you can tell the difference, even the ones over 6-7 quid. The reds are much smoother and tastier. I like the very crisp white wines but they can be a bit much after a while, better with food. 

A good single malt whisky. I was put off whisky for life after a teenage experiment but quite liked a Jack &amp; coke. A good whisky I can drink neat with ice, no other spirit I can do that with. Gin &amp; tonics are very refreshing, I like them a lot. Otherwise at home I don't have much spirits in, they just sit there or inevitably end up in a jug of cocktail at a bbq.

First thing to think about is the sheer amount of distance between clubs in MLS. Some clubs will travel an excess of 23000 miles this year on road trips. That's like West Ham (or anyone else) playing 40 games of European football a year.

The travel is insane. There was a period 2 months or so ago where LA traveled to Dallas, flew back to LA, then traveled to Orlando in the span of 6 days. That's 8000 miles in less than a week. Another time LA had five games in 15 days, including three away games on the East Coast.

*Because* the distances are so great, MLS does not have balanced scheduling. If they did they'd be asking some clubs (Vancouver, for example) to travel an excess of 35000 miles in a season. And *because* the schedules are unbalanced a promotion/relegation system is not feasible. It is unfair to punish a club for having the worst record when not all teams have the same schedule.

And because the schedules aren't balanced, the playoffs become the best way of determining ""who is the best"". The Supporter's Shield (best regular season record) holds no value in MLS because schedules aren't balanced. Instead the playoffs decide the best team because it is a home-and-away tie between the top teams in the league, similar to the Champions' League knockout stages.

Do I like it? Not really. I'd love to see promotion and relegation and balanced schedules... but I understand the logistical nightmare of trying to accommodate that and in turn I understand how unlikely it is to happen.",null,0,null,1438707618,null,null,false,0,ctr9mj9,null,t3_3fqs90,null,null,null,t1_ctr976m,null,null,null,1440277175,null,2,null,Hammers,t5_2sco3,2,null

There's nothing to discredit so far.

&gt; when further investigations are still going on, hence tip of the iceberg. 

The further investigations may find something or nothing. With ""tip of the iceberg"" you are implying that there *is* something, namely 9 times as much as has been uncovered so far. That's adventurous.

&gt; It's not a witch-hunt to want a proper investigation that would prove or refute allegations.

An investigation that starts by assuming that the horrible things that *were* uncovered in Jersey were just the ""tip of the iceberg"", strongly risks to become a witch-hunt, not a ""proper investigation"".

Good. The post-war consensus was much better than the Thatcherite shithole that followed it, massive inequality, injustice, poverty and suffering on a much larger scale than anything that existed in the 1970's.

&gt;Even though the three day week happened under a Tory Government, it was under the post war consensus. 

Yes a consensus that the Tories believed in.

&gt;Ted Heath (bit odd to bring him up now) believed in 'full employment'. He was brought down by unions.

Good. It wasn't just the unions, it was a general election where Ted Heath said ""who do you choose the Tory party or the Miners"" and the Miners won.

&gt;Same with the winter of discontent, Callaghan was brought down by the militant unions and it hurt the country so much. 

Nothing militant about those unions. They were right then and they're right now.

&gt;Propping up unproductive industries to keep employment up

Nothing to do with productivity - it was to do with destroying the trade union movement. They destroyed Britain as a manufacturing and industry centre because as a means by which to attack the trade union movement and discipline the working-class.

&gt;controlling prices

A good thing

&gt;constant inflation

If that inflation is a result of higher wage increases for workers and lower returns for capital then that's great. No wonder the 1970's was the lowest inequality on record!

&gt;high taxes 

Even better! Tax the bastards until they're pissing blood imo.

&gt;not a future that anyone wants to go back to

I'd beg to differ. Much better than the current state of Britain, a massive floating hedge fund and tax haven with fuck all productivity, the worst inequality and poverty in western europe, no proper industry, a rapacious and exploitative labour market, shit welfare and social provision.

To be perfectly honest, having lived in the UK and abroad, I can safely say that I'm not surprised by this at all. Britain is full of people who are depressed and lack of exposure to sunlight is a contributing factor, although I do agree its not the only factor. Just look at when its sunny in Britain. Everyone is suddenly a lot happier, the cold nonchalant looking faces of despair are gone and everyone is well in the mood for a good time. Then the rain kicks back in during Autumn and slowly so does the depression. 

I bet there is a high correlation between Vitamin D deficiency and the prevalance of Seasonal Affective Disorder. I now live in a much poorer country but most people seem a lot happier and healthier because there is a lot more sun exposure and daylight in general. People go out more, socialise more, often have better and closer relationships and in general are a lot healthier.

No I'm saying that if you use your media to undermine and try to overthrow a sovereign government (as happened in both 2002, 2008 and partially in 2012/13) you should be treated like any other criminal organisation. Considering how they've behaved I think that Venezuela has been remarkably restrained.

I also don't think that undermining right-wing propaganda outlets is a bad thing. We don't have a free press here in Britain we have a press which are servile propagandists for those in power, bought and owned by oligarchs, and I'd like to see media ownership totally changed. Media is one of the key institutions that the oligarchs use to cement their political control. I'd have no problem with shutting the Daily Mail down and throwing fascist scum like Lord Rothermere in the gulag for all the toxic shit they've pumped into our political discourse for the last 100 years.

&gt;Interesting you don't dare mention the corruption, crime, food shortages and rationing.

Since corruption and crime are features of nearly every South American state singling out Venezuela in particular is interesting. You can make the same claims for American puppet states like Honduras and Colombia. 

&gt;And seeing last years protests

haha protests that were funded and backed by the US and which were, astonishingly, restricted entirely to the wealthy suburbs? Were civilians were murdered by right-wing gangs? Those sorts of protests over here would be called terrorism....

Venezuelan socialist party has lost some support since the price of oil dropped, but they still smash the pro-US opposition in most elections. Unless Capriles and the pro-US parties start to reach out beyond the small minority of wealthy Venezuelans they can't win a presidential election. This is true of most South American democracies btw - which is why the US has such a long history of supporting dictatorships in that part of the world.

United only really have Rooney up top, Arsenal don't seem to be interested in adding any defenders when Kos and Bellerin are the only players with any class and City could completely go either way. 

Rooney, Ageuro or Sanchez get injured you'd have to favour us for a top 4 finish as it stands. 

I really think Milner, Benteke, Clyne and Firmino replace Sterling and fills the gap left by Suarez last season. Also expecting Lovren, Moreno, Markovic, Lallana and Ibe to really kick on this season. Could do with a Kolo/Skrtl (long term)/Enrique replacement though IMO, but Gomez looks good and that's what January is for.

I wouldn't. He's a great passer but he leaves the team vulnerable on defence so gets put as the attacking mid in big games where Silva has been consistently more effective and plays in the two against weaker opposition where Fernandinho and Toure are just as effective. Fabregas looks flashy just like Yaya does but he doesn't shape a game or have the potential to in the same level as Modric, Rakitic, Pogba, Iniesta or even bizarrely a fit Thiago. He's not the best midfielder at Chelsea, Matic is 


&gt; In any event, Aguero is top notch but we all know his injury troubles can play a role, Bony came up a level considering where he played before and he's yet to 'light anything up' ...so logic follows just that a player who was trusted by WC runners up and Madrid once upon a time could do a job. 

Bony came up a level and is  untested but shown the right attitude and been effective for an inferior team. Higuain is player who already failed at that level, already shown that he isn't as good as other players and has a clear attitude problem that would certainly result in him not being happy to play second fiddle is not the answer. Higuain scores 16 in Serie A playing for Napoli, Bony manages it for Swansea and is happy to play bench.

Absolute minimum and maximum for numbers is 0 - infinity, since that's what wavelengths are measured in.   But as you keep asking questions about how numbers work, I keep having to work backward a grade level every time you have a question.

For the record extreme ends of the spectrum aren't even needed or called for only those on the two ends of a defined spectrum.  As I said before.


&gt; I know how people measure points on spectrums. My point is that there exist spectrums where the start and end points cannot be measured.

Visible light has starting and end points that CAN be measured,in NANOMETERS, I'm perplexed that you don't yet know this.

The 14/15 season was the perfect opportunity to put ourselves at a level closer to theirs. We were in CL, had a season where were easily the most attractive, entertaining attacking side in Europe and were the toast of the football world.

We could have built a truly quality squad on that goodwill and instead squandered it bringing in players with potential but no real certainty, especially in the scoring department.

So now we've brought in more reliable players than we did last season, but catching up that should have been done last season is still being worked on while our top four competitors have certainly made better progress.

So no. We won't make top four. I hope to be surprised and of the top four, I see Utd and City being our best chances at possibly beating them to a spot. City kinda always strike me as on the verge of an implosion and fail to get the best out of their enormous talent. As for Utd, their most reliable, dead cert goalscorer is Rooney, and if he suffers an injury, they could be buggered. Yeah, they still have Depay, but who knows how that could work out. They're a good squad with huge talent at hand, but no smoothly running machine. Arsenal and Chelsea look far more solid.

Also, Toby and Wimmer were each way over on the right side of the box. Alli was defending above the arc, Dier had dropped deep to cover behind Wimmer. Clearly Vorm was concerned about James (pointing at him before cross), but Dier didn't seem to know what was behind him and Rose got beat. Vorm coming half way and then quitting was the final masterpiece of that goal.

Not sure how much responsibility dier has to be aware of James' run, but it's something you'd like to see from an experienced defender (cd or DM). Also not sure if Wimmer being so far off his zone is part of the master plan, but Dier was in place to make a play had he been aware.

I have an extra i5 4590 still in the box unopened and undamaged. Selling it as my brother gave me a 4690k so I will not use it for my girlfriend's computer.

Looking either for money or a used/new low to mid-range gpu. I currently have a r7 250 and I was thinking about an upgrade. Also considering other offers like ssd's / pc monitor / etc...

Able to pickup in the manchester area. Also able to post it.

Any question feel free to ask

If the FCO does not campaign against executions, then from time to time a British subject will face capital punishment, whether they were indeed guilty or not. This is a problem for the FCO as well as the individuals concerned.

Wolves have completed a deal for Liverpool’s highly-rated young winger Sheyi Ojo which will see him spend the season on loan at Molineux.

The 18-year-old wideman has completed a medical and will join his new teammates on Thursday morning as the squad prepares to travel to Blackburn on Saturday. 

Ojo enjoyed his first taste of senior football on loan with Wigan last season when he made 11 appearances in the Sky Bet Championship. 

Born in Hemel Hempstead, Ojo was snapped up by the MK Dons Academy from the age of 10, before joining Liverpool in 2011, at the age of 14. 

Whilst not having yet figured for Liverpool’s first team, he has been an unused substitute and is hailed as a player with plenty of potential for the future. 

Ojo has represented England at Under-16, Under-17 and Under-18 levels. 

He came off the bench in Liverpool’s friendly against Swindon on Sunday and scored the winner in a 2-1 victory. 

The youngster revealed his delight at the move and explained that he can't wait to get going. 

“It’s a great feeling,"" he said before adding: ""I’m looking forward to the upcoming season. Hopefully we can have a good year and push for promotion. 

“It’s a really good club. It’s got great facilities. All of the players are nice, they have welcomed me to the club and the staff are brilliant as well. 

“Everything’s going well, I’m just looking forward to starting the season at the weekend."" 

Head of Football Development and Recruitment, Kevin Thelwell believes Ojo has a lot to offer during his time at Molineux. 

“He’s a little bit different to what we’ve got. He’s out-and-out pace and power, he’s very direct, he’s got the ability to beat people one v one,"" explained Thelwell. 

“He’s got the ability to assist, the ability to score and then he’s also got a very good personality. 

“Even though he’s very young, he’s well rounded, his parents are very supportive and we think he’ll be a very good fit for us. 

“He’s fit, he’s well and he’s been playing all of pre-season so we’re expecting for him to hit the ground running.""",null,0,null,1438713405,null,null,false,0,ctrdoh5,null,t3_3frzt2,null,null,null,t3_3frzt2,null,null,null,1440279151,null,11,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

2.) If we buy KdB and don't sell someone (most likely Nasri), Lopes will be as good as gone. This is the perfect time to place some faith in Rony and if we go out and buy another player for 50m for a position in which we already have a good deal of depth, Lopes will get very limited chances.

However, now they have Schneiderlin and Bastian to pick the passes. 

Against PSG, the long balls were pretty well placed. Thiago Silva played a game of epic proportions and made 7 or 8 last second clearances to deny Rooney, Depay, and Mata. 

The only reason I'd push for having those two in midfield is because of the height and prowess in the air. Dier could sit back and defend with Vert and Toby, while Alli goes up a bit higher to try and pump some creativity in.

I don't agree. I believe when Suarez left, he took with him any goodwill or attractiveness that we had gained from being in the champion's league. 

Players aren't idiots. Even though we qualified that year, they know we can just as easily miss out the following year, especially after losing our best player. 

To gain that goodwill you mention, it will take 2 or 3 years of consecutive qualification, without looking like we will fall back out of favour as soon as we sell one player.

**KEEP**

United have probably done the best business. If they gel quickly they'll place well. Could still use a new striker though. 

With Chelsea I'm conflicted. They were great last year so not disrupting that with too many signings could make sense. On the other hand, teams tend to stagnate if not actively improved. I believe they won't repeat this year for that reason. (Assuming no major signings between now and the end of the window.) Mourinho also has a tendency to have a poor third year if I remember correctly. 

Arsenal have signed a great keeper. But that's it. I didn't watch them much last year, did they really not need improvement anywhere else? Striker maybe? A new CB?

City have obviously made a great signing with Sterling. Delph is quality depth. Anyone else? Still questionable defense and relying on Aguero to stay fit. And they sold Dzeko and Milner most notably.

null,null,CheeseMakerThing,null,null,null,"As it stands, our team can stay up comfortably but will not finish higher than twelfth. Our defence is solid, Lescott and McAuley are a great pair, Chester is a good little centre half, Olsson is a capable backup despite his legs having gone, Dawson and Brunt showed they can do a very good job in defence, Liam O'Neil has been good throughout the youth system and has looked pretty decent on loan so is good cover and is two footed and Pocognoli may get a chance as Pulis has taken a shine to him over pre season, Gamboa will be played in midfield if he stays as he doesn't fit the system. As for academy cover, Donellan and Fitzwater can step up if need be as they are both pretty good and then we have Danny Barbir who is over 6'%"" and is still growing, is strong, is very quick and is extremely comfortable on the ball. I think we need full back cover but it is Pulis and he likes variety so I don't think there will be too many alterations. McClean and Gardner can cover there well enough as 3rd choices.

We are in a good position for goalkeepers, Foster is great but can have his off days, Bo is always solid and Rose is a good shotstopper, needs to command his area more though and fix his positioning which is suspect, but he is 20 years old and has plenty of time. Maybe we should loan him out to improve those areas. We need cover though as Foster is out until October, and not Marton Fulop calibre, if Bo gets a knock we are buggered. I can see the lure of Marshall but would rather get a decent Championship keeper on loan for 6 months, someone like Kieran Westwood?

Centre midfield we are stacked, Fletcher and Yacob as holding midfielders, Morrison and Sessegnon with flair, Gardner can cover both. 5 players for 2 positions and options is good and with Dorrans and Mulumbu gone there is more likelihood of everyone playing. This is an area though where we may struggle for cover if we have an injury crisis, this is the only place where I cannot think of good cover from the academy.

Onto wingers, and we need at least one, preferably 2. McMannaman is good and McClean is alright. Brunt can cover, as can O'Neil, but Brunt isn't quick and O'Neil can't beat players. Sako would be a good rotation option but doesn't track back. Ideally we get Phillips in for the right wing, and I hope we do. For the left wing we need some flair, we have McMannaman who runs and runs but maybe getting someone like Fidel Chaves from Elche. He was the only really decent player in Cordoba's team. Pulis doesn't like buying foreign players though. Demari Gray from Blues or Nathan redmond would be perfect, but expensive. Leko, Samir Nabi and Campbell are fantastic prospects and can make the step up from the academy. 

Up front we have 4 main players, one is going, ideally Vic because he is made of glass and is on big wages. Saido first choice guaranteed. Lambert will be good cover and situational starter to play off of, as would Bobby Brown, who can cover the wingers as well. Adil Nabi can be backup for Saido as they are quite similar. Tyler Roberts will play a few cup games, he is an unreal finisher and is better than Saido at the same stage. We probably need a quality and physical striker for Sado to play off though. Bas Dost will be good, but can we afford him is the question?

Aside from the usual suspects, Fernandinho. While he has always been a rock in our midfield and very important, he's been overshadowed by Toure. This year, with Toure likely to get more of a rotating role, I think it will allow him to not only continue his great form in defense, but showcase his rather impressive technical skill. 

&gt;How do you think the team will line up?

            Silva - Aguero - Sterling 

           Delph - Toure - Fernandinho

     Clichy - Demichelis - Mangala - Zabaleta 
 
                       Hart

Fernando Slotting in against better squads, Denayer rotating in early in the season. Kompany when he regains form.

Jamie Redknapp will make a passing comment on the style of play, Jose will refuse a hand shake to run up to the box to nut him resulting in a 4 match stadium ban. 

Arsenal, predicted finish 2nd - If I was an Arsenal fan I would be expecting at the very minimum a title challenge. It's quite hard to find a weakness in their team now, if you do happen to find one there's a great replacement to fill in. It'll be a good year for those with their prawn sandwiches in the Emirates this year. To be honest (I'd never let my flatmate, or any other Arsenal fan for that matter, know this) but I hope they push on and do the business. The only thing standing in their way is cynicism and a Arsenal-ness. 

Man City, predicted finish 3rd - It all depends on one little brilliant man. Sergio has that knack to go out and win a game, much like another South American, should he stay fit that 3rd could be a 1st if he doesn't well... Frailties in defence may be their undoing this year. Kompany look ever more Daniel Agger by the year, such a great player, such frequent injuries. Mangala (FIFA 14 legend) needs to step it up this year. Solid players everywhere, I fear that young Raheem may play out of his skin beside Silva/Yaya/Sergio.

Man Utd, the magic 8 ball is unsure, ask again later - I've been sitting in the office for the past 70 odd days listening to how Utd fans believe that they will challenge this year, this year will be their year if you will.They're turning into us lads. I sat talking to a Utd fan today, who was claiming that Thiago Silva was out his mind saying that PSG are a bigger club than Utd. My rebuttal was simple, PSG will do better in the CL, they'll probably win everything in France again, to a football player these are the things that matter. His response was gold lads, I shit you not, he said, and I quote ""But PSG have no history, Man Utd have a great history in the CL and League"". I think they'll flatter to deceive this year, Depay good, Schneiderlin good, Swchiney could go either way, defence tumbleweed rolls, striking options have lessened. If De Gea goes I'd say we have a chance, if he doesn't and our signings perform then maybe we do. I hope this doesn't come back to bite me in the arse.

I went like 9 years without a chance to play an organized game with a ref since my family couldn't afford the fees/travel to put me on a ""club"" team.

But the league itself is still a bit weird to me; rules change, it seems to be more similar to South American/Mexican soccer leagues in that it's a bit weird as far as scheduling, instead of your standard European league where everyone plays everyone twice (your countries are all tiny though).  Playoff system is definitely an American thing though.  Very normal here in every major team sport.

null,null,[deleted],null,null,null,"Well firstly they don't just *create the money out of thin air* it's somewhat more complex than that. Private banks create the money that forms deposits and so-on, but they have to create that money contingent on real-world liabilities and conditions, so the *out of thin air* bit is a bit misleading. It's not out of thin air, they create money based on actual obligations. If they were simply creating money from *literally nothing* then things such as the credit crunch of 2008 would never have happened - the banks could simply create more money out of thin air to solve all their liquidity troubles instead of having to rely on the taxpayer.

There's a lot of borderline conspiracy stuff out there which uses this line ""create money out of thin air"" and I'd recommend avoiding it, it mystifies what is a routine part of banking. Same also applies for fractional reserve banking. 

Now public bank, like the Bank of England, has specific obligations that are of a political nature - such as being able to control interest rates - and it's also not a commercial bank but the lynchpin of the entire financial system. They can reduce or increase the supply of money in the economy via printing new money *without* the same sorts of obligations as other commercial banks. 

I have no problem with the idea of public banks printing money that's one of their jobs. I have no problem with them being used to fund public infrastructure I think that's a good idea - not only would it be cheaper than relying on loans from the private sector but it would also crowd out private sector investment as well.

The night tube is slated to start on 12 September, with five lines running 24 hours on Fridays and Saturdays. Drivers are concerned at the amount of night shifts they'll have to work (though LU has recently said it'll allow drivers to refuse to work nights — which rather backs union ASLEF's assertion before the previous strike that night shifts were being introduced in an unfair way that didn't allow for work/life balance). The dispute has also got increasingly nasty, with some drivers sent home last week for refusing to take out trains they say haven't had full safety checks.
Three other unions — the RMT, TSSA and Unite — are also striking. The RMT has called LU's latest offer a ""re-hash of previous plans"" which they've already rejected, while ASLEF wants guarantees about the number of weekend rest days drivers will have. All unions are calling on LU to delay the start of the night tube so working patterns can be properly agreed with staff, something which LU appears unwilling to do. So: strike.

Negative equity means you need to borrow more than the value of the property you want to buy as you need to clear the old one.  Getting a new mortgage for more than 100% of the property is very difficult/impossible - even if you can clear the negative equity with savings, that is likely to wipe out your deposit so you are still left with a very high ""loan to value"" which makes the mortgage more expensive, if you can get one.

While higher than 100% mortgages have been available since the 90's when I had negative equity, I believe they have been restricted more recently.

1. Austerity doesn't shrink a deficit, what austerity does is take government money that is used for services / the public, and use it to pay off the debts. (debts and deficit aren't the same thing) Sounds good right? Not really considering the only reason we have such massive debts anyway is because of the massive failing of the private sector, and instead of holding the individuals accountable we bailed them out with government money. The Euro is fucked, and what's happened to greece will start to happen all over Europe, starting with Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy. Austerity is an invalid government response to the failing of the private sector, and does nothing but increase poverty, increase unemployment, and decreases the standard of living and causes a downwards spiral. The only time austerity is ever a valid response to an economic problem is in response to a crisis of which is caused by the overspending of the state. Which I think we all know by now isn't the reason for the huge debt. All austerity does is reinforce a political ideology held by that of our government and those at the very top of society.

2. Sorry economic credibility? I just established that austerity doesn't work, it's been proven time and time again, yet we're set for another five years of it under the Tories, and you want to talk about economic credibility?
