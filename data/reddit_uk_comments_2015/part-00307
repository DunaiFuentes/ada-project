1) Henderson and Milner in a double pivot just does not work. They were both overly cautious and weren't allowed to press with the front line, allowing Stoke plenty of time on the ball. It looked much better when Can came in and anchored the midfield. Also, for a central midfielder Milner was going along the right side far too often. He needs to be looking to pick up the ball in the middle of the park and dictate play if he wants to play in that position.

2)I don't like Joe Gomez at left back. He offered us absolutely no width, and forced us to attack down Stoke's other side which was much stronger defensively. We need someone to make those overlapping runs on the left to give Lallana more space or else Lallana is not effective at all. Too often, Gomez would receive the ball and immediately go backwards or back into the middle because he was hesitant to go forward with his left.

3)We can't be putting too much pressure on Ibe, he is still very much a raw player. I was disappointed with his runs today. I wish he looked to penetrate behind more often but he receives the ball too far back and ends up dribbling into trouble. His lack of penetrating runs also allowed Benteke virtually no space.",null,0,null,1439148997,null,null,false,0,ctx5iws,null,t3_3gdkqo,null,null,null,t3_3gdkqo,null,null,null,1440378958,null,11,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

Secondly, when Can came on I thought they looked great.

 Don't think either team deserved more than a point but that strike was brilliant. Glen Johnson was my man of the match, but should have buried that strike in the first half. Sidwell and Adam both didn't look fit enough to play but considering we had 4 starters missing it's hard to complain. Saying that we definitely missed Bojan today and if Ireland came on for Adam the game could have finished differently.

Not too worried about the season ahead. Once Affellay starts getting more confident and starts taking on his man he will be a major threat. I think MvG and Whelan both looked solid defensively, and I reckon MvG will start getting forward more (like N'Zonzi does) once the team start playing together a bit better.

Get used to that mate.
Everything within a couple hundred miles from London is a *little underwhelming*.

The A4 is nice, especially towards Marlborough, but just long bends that are interesting at decent speed (aka: quite fast), and there is always some traffic.
Lovely countryside and nice pubs around though.

A272 is the same. Basically you ride one hour to get on a road that is only 5 corners.  
Loomies is cool for a stop and a chat for some random bikers though.

Best roads are on the other side of the channel. Or far up North or West I'm told. :)

We'd have a lot more to admire if we hadn't, in a fit of rank cultural vandalism, torn down huge swathes of the country's Victorian era buildings in the 60s. 

Birmingham went from a city that looked like this [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Victorian_New_Street_Station.png) and [this](http://www.oldukphotos.com/graphics/England%20Photos/Warwickshire,%20Birmingham,%20New%20Street%20-%201280pix.jpg) to looking like [this](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8229/8507698981_6a49d707a6_b.jpg)

The way architecture has evolved has a lot to do with our negative relationship with it now. Aspects like functionality, affordability and a disdain for 'needless' ornamentalism became central to the way we built things post WW2, and continue to influence architecture to this day. 

Artistically, it'd be disingenuous to affix classically or religiously influenced symbolism/flourishes to our buildings, because we live in a post modern, secular society. Yet those are the kind of touches that humanise buildings and allow us to develop a close relationship with them. 

Modern buildings often feel cold and bland. They don't have those human touches. They are rarely developed in a way that is cognisant of its surroundings. They dominate but don't engage and they don't reward repeated viewings. The increasingly international nature of modern architecture means you could be anywhere in the world with many new developments. And people don't like that. They don't like uniformity and they don't like buildings that dehumanise. 

Prime example I'd give is the Neo Bankside development in Vauxhall- picture [here](http://www.wintech-group.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/farandclose.jpg)

Obviously there's still a lot of good stuff being built. But much like how in the 60s, we definitely made a huge amount of mistakes in our architectural choices, I think the same is happening now.

Yes, the left rightly criticises Choudary. That's because he is aggressively Islamist, openly calls people infidels and apostates and seeks to cause outrage in order to generate publicity for himself. That is a far less clever, but no less sinister, method of spreading Islamism compared to Abdul Wahid. Wahid's interview with the Guardian was an over-flattering, even supine attempt to understand his views. It painted him as a victim when he is one of the country's chief advocates of theocratic fascism. Would an interview with Nick Griffin have gone the same way? I think not. 

Finally, on your point that as a free society we should give a platform to controversial speakers... I totally agree. I would never outlaw Islamism as a belief just as I wouldn't outlaw Neo-Nazism. All I'm asking is that we regard Islamism with the same contempt as other kinds of extremism. Would the Guardian have dedicated an entire article to an interview with the leader of the EDL? No. Would an EDL member get invited to give a speech on a university campus?

Your entire narrative is based on the fact you haven't read the article you're talking about.


&gt;His front room is a very ordinary environment for a man who leads an organisation so frequently accused of **bigotry and worse**. 




&gt;In recent years HT has been charged with trying to **bring down democracy, antisemitism and suppressing women. It also outrages many foreign governments.**


&gt;When the head of the Pakistan army visited Britain in January, getting Britain to clamp down on HT was top of his agenda.


&gt;I remind Wahid that men and women are **segregated** by a screen at these HT meetings.


&gt;I turn to the charge that his organisation **is antisemitic**


&gt;**Once again I invite Wahid to denounce the pamphlet.**



&gt;You can say many things about Wahid, and be **appalled by much of what he says**. But in a democracy he surely has the right to say it. Whatever the government thinks.

Read the article ffs.

My main worry was that when listening I heard so much about defensive mistakes. Targett seemed to be constantly caught out, the the commentator did say this was possibly because Rodriguez was a bit out of position/that Targett wasn't getting much help, so was easily passed around. Also heard Yoshida being out of position a few times etc, which again, isn't ideal. Soares was off by the time I listened, but Martina actually sounded to be the better of our defenders along with the ever awesome Fonte.

null,null,podpool3,null,null,null,"&gt;What did we do right today?

We defended pretty well. And actually Lovren did ok, I like many others had doubts about him, but he dealt the most things well.

&gt;What did we do wrong?

The intensity was missing and attacking flair, our control of the possession wasn't too great either. At points we looked void of ideas and Benteke was looking more and more isolated. However we'll get better it was the first game of the season, there's plenty more from this team to come. Also I don't think Lallana did much to impress, I'm a fan of his and really want him to do well, but I don't see what he offers - maybe its the position he's playing in?

&gt;Who was your MOTM?

I don't think you can not give it to Coutinho the strike was sublime. But for an 18 year old I thought Joe Gomez was really good today, a couple of mistakes here and there but nothing major and his cut inside and simple pass to Phil got him the assist. The kid has a bright future ahead of him.

&gt;New player impressions

Not seen enough from Firmino but the glimpses I saw today he looked very promising, I think he can open a lot of defences this season. As mentioned above Gomez was impressive for such a young lad. We need more support around Benteke but I think he can score a good return of goals.


&gt;Tactics and formation; what do you think should happen for our next match?

I'd play something similar as today, however I don't think we need both Hendo and Milner sitting, one of them should be left to roam forward or deployed further forward. Both have supreme running power to get ahead of Benteke or even support the attack with him. I'd like to see more press and intensity from the team as a whole. I really hope we haven't lost that trait because its a big reason why we did so well in Suarez' final season. The press and intensity should be part of our identity.",null,0,null,1439151518,null,null,1439155646,0,ctx6yh6,null,t3_3gdkqo,null,null,null,t3_3gdkqo,null,null,null,1440379633,null,0,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

He did some of the last ditch blocks and tackles that get you noticed but he didn't fulfil the function he was meant to in the system.

The fact is if Schneid was in the team, Targett would have had better protection.

If there is no milk in the shop because the farmers bought it all, that defeats the entire point. They're selling bucketloads of milk at a loss, and no one buying the milk is getting other things to make it profitable.

You can't change the formation and expect fireworks after one competitive game - this is obviously more nuanced than when you have a clearly world class player and can just play whatever formation you feel like and still score 4-5. We've been brutally spoiled by Suarez (and Sturridge to some extent) but I don't think we should blindly revert to the 4-1-2-3 / 4-3-3 single pivot formation because we really should be relying on our front 3-4 to penetrate opposition teams rather than force our central players to do so. It's really not their primary responsibility in a double pivot! There's the very clear potential to evolve something better than the 4-1-2-3 here, which might give us more defensive solidity in the long run.

We had a lot of expectation after the 6-1 and with Firmino in for Lallana, we might have the right personnel to run the formation well with better attacking output. Also it will help once Milner and Hendo  (and the 2 behind and 4 in front of them) are more used to it.

The crap buildings get redeveloped, the best continue to be used.

We're now realising that the crap buildings we built in the 60's are no longer any good, we lived with them and they are slowly being redeveloped. Though the best buildings built in that era aren't. Before the 60's, they realised the crap buildings built in lets say the 20's were no longer any good, they lived with them and they slowly got redeveloped. In 40 years from now the crap buildings we've built won't be any good, we lived with them and they will slowly be redeveloped.

It's an ongoing cycle, the best buildings of each era continue to be used, and the shit stuff goes. The only difference is that we currently live with *our* shit stuff so it's more obvious and it's easy to think we didn't build poor buildings historically.

null,null,BillionBalconies,null,null,null,"&gt; Are Black Brits as politically active as African-Americans ,for example is there a British version of the NAACP ,black panthers or holidays around black people like Martin Luther King Day?

No, or at least, not that I'm aware of. We do have politically active black Brits, but they're generally politically active as British citizens, not as representatives of their race. And, no, we don't have any holidays relating to black civil rights activists, or anything like that. We don't  even celebrate 

&gt; did the black community have civil rights leaders like Martin king/Malcolm X?

Probably, but nobody who has been elevated to the status of the likes of MLK. I certainly couldn't name anybody. 

&gt;  final question how integrated would you say they were in British culture such as: neighborhoods ,media representation and presence of a middle class

Firstly, it should be noted that blacks represent a tiny proportion of the general population. They're something like 2% of the total, making them a relatively small ethnic minority. IIRC, they're around 20% in the US. To answer your questions though,

* We don't really have neighbourhoods in the UK. Not in the collectively social sense, anyway. We'll typically know the people in the immediate radius of our homes, but second or third door along, and we'll have no idea. It's a moot point, really.

* Media representation is debatable. Lenny Henry did a talk about BMEs in the media which I'd advise you look into (it'll be on youtube, and it's about 40 minutes long) which you might find interesting and enlightening, but do, of course, consider his words critically. Personally, I feel that blacks are fairly well represented in the media, and are possibly over-represented relative to their % of the population. 

* Blacks and social class is a difficult one. To *very* broadly state it, I think Britain is a pretty inclusive society these days, and as part of that, blacks can quite comfortably be part of the middle, working, lower, and criminal classes. Upper is more difficult because that really requires the historical family background that immigrants, whatever their generation, tend to lack. Generally speaking through, what's accessible to your regular white man is accessible to your regular African. 

But then, this is all based on my interpretation from the viewpoint of a white, early-30s male who grew up in a relatively nice and very white part of Edinburgh. Others may tell you other things.

null,null,Pee_The_Freedos,null,null,null,"New Labour were not ""flush with cash in the early years"", they inherited a budget deficit of over 3% of GDP from the Major government, but then went onto achieve a surplus in the years 1999-2001. 

Between 1997 and 2001 Blair was actually accused of being too Conservative with his spending plans, and only embarked on lavish spending on public services following the 2001 election. This caused the deficit too increase, but it was not unsustainable by any means. This spending on healthcare and education was badly needed, following 18 years of neglect by Tory governments.

Also, as the graph below illustrates, the deficits incurred by New Labour prior to the crisis, were no higher than the deficits during the Thatcher and Major governments. And this was in spite of Conservative governments receiving large windfalls of cash due to privatisation of industry.

Most of the Tory voters I know make the mistake of conflating spending cuts with spending reductions. Decreasing public sector debt often leads to increasing private sector debt (at higher rates of interest). While cuts to public services often lead to spending increases in other areas of government in the future - welfare spending actually increased under Thatcher.

&gt;Possession football requires a purpose; Everton play with none. Play builds from the back from memory and instruction rather than the belief a goal may be the eventual outcome. Crosses into the penalty area arrive in hope not expectation; through balls to Lukaku are rarer than a white truffle.

&gt;The only width is from overworked full-backs pushing forward. The attacking quartet ahead of James McCarthy and Gareth Barry favour central areas; their tendency to drift into similar positions leaves teammates without options in the final third.

&gt;Attacks funnel aimlessly through the middle and the congestion of players prevents the ball moving at quickly. Possession inevitably returns to the middle third because of the inability to drag opposing players from their positions. There is no space to exploit due to passes lacking the penetration and accuracy to puncture holes in opposing defences.

Given that the deterrent would only be used as a 'strike back' too, it's application is fairly limited.

Here's an article succinctly explaining how it's ridiculous to claim that Corbyn helped facilitate peace in NI --http://labour-uncut.co.uk/2015/08/07/the-idea-that-jeremy-corbyn-laid-the-foundations-for-peace-in-northern-ireland-is-total-fantasy/ 

TL:DR - he basically just took the Sinn Fein line. You say that the IRA and Hamas things are 'tired.' I thought the attacks on Ed for 'backstabbing' his brother and eating a bacon sandwhich badly were tired. These are far worse. As for standing on the right side of history, tell that to the Bosnian muslims that he was willing to let be wiped out as he took a pro-Milosevic line and afterwards denied that genocide had taken place (http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2004-05/392) Most of his foreign policy positions are insane. People may not have wanted Miliband in charge because they saw him as useless, but they'll see Corbyn as *dangerous*

b)I'll agree to disagree but I still think you're wrong

c) Labour didn't do enough to right the claim that they caused the crash, but the debt still exists and people still blame labour for it. You cannot magic the debt and the deficit away. The debt is rising but the deficit is decreasing, which is all the Tories need to point to as a measure of success. For 7ish years the public has blamed Labour for being irresponsible with the economy, with the Tories then making cuts to 'balance the books' and now you think that Labour can just turn around and argue for higher spending? You need credibility. It would have an effect all right; it could be an exercise in seeing how many truly safe seats Labour has.

d) By being 'bold' you throw away the chance to make any change at all. Offer to give someone £1000 and they'll think it's a scam. Offer them £10 and they may take it. It's not a very good analogy I'll admit, but you get my point. I want a Labour government that can do 20% of what I want rather than a Tory gov't doing 100% of what I don't. The electorate changes? Perhaps. But I don't think that culture and economics make more of a difference that politics - i.e. liberalism of the 60s, post-cold war 90s.

Yeah Sanders won't win because he won't have the money. Clinton will probably win the presidency due to simple demographics (a growing hispanic vote that the Republicans seem determined to insult) However, I don't think its certain, and if the Republicans come to their senses and pick a good candidate like Marco Rubio it's possible for them to win.

12 seats is about 10% of  the seats Labour needs to win a working majority. And that's not even counting the impact of boundary reforms and English-votes-for-English-Laws. Because of these two things, and the SNP, to get a majority Labour has to win seats in England that it has *never* won before, like Basingstoke and Chingfood and Wood Green. Tory seats that didn't swing Labour even in 97. Going to the left = not going to win.

Johnson and Clarke are senior Tory politicians. I'm sure they don't have any vested interest in doing anything to get a candidate they see as (and is) unelectable winning..

By credible, will people look at Jeremy Corbyn and think 'yes, this is the man I trust to be Prime Minister. This is the person I trust with the economy and with the defence of the realm' Corbyn is too radical, too on the fringes, and has too many crazy political positions that I'be mentioned already. On a purely petty basis, he looks rather like an elderly geography teacher and speaks like an academic, a bit like Michael Foot actually. That's not the reason I dislike him and aren't voting for him and its very petty, but so is Ed Miliband's inability to eat a bacon sandwich. 

And yes, I am 100% sure, for all the reasons I've said. He can introduce these new ideas all he wants, but they'll be lost in a maelstrom of mockery and fear. *Not credible* In the best case scenario he may force the Tories to make very weak adjustments to their policies like the 'living wage' But if you ask me if I'd rather win the argument or the election, it's the election every time. 

The so-called living wage will go down in history as one of Ed Miliband's only achievements. An increase in the minimum wage is undoubtedly a good thing, but Osborne stole it and repackaged it as a Tory achievement. And he did it brilliantly - he has redefined the living wage in popular opinion. I think arguing that it's not the proper living wage, is a waste of time and will come across as petty. Small c conservatives and centrists have hearts I agree, but they also have brains. And the Tories can make little gestures to show that they have hearts. And most people simple vote by their pocketbooks, for what is best for them, as well as the country as a whole.

E) this is just a useless letter now

F)Nope. Ken lost election in 2008. I didn't use the 2008 election as an example as it was during the financial crisis and the nadir of Labour support. But in 2012 Boris had just finished his first term, and the Tory government was very unpopular. Labour actually did really well in the London Assembly elections at the same time, showing how it was Ken and not mainstream Labour that was rejected. And Ken had widespread leftist support, and the supplementary voting system meant he got all the green/tusc/etc. second preferences. And London is by far the most left-wing part of the country. Ken failed in London. To a man who could be Corbyn's opponent in 2020 (Although I think it will be Osborne) 

Letting MPs vote by conscience is crazy - the party needs to be disciplined to challenge the government and to win. Not that I think Corbyn would be able to create a disciplined party even if he wanted to.

As for people supporting his policies - I assume you are referring to things like rail nationalisation? People support it in polls but they also support cutting off all immigration and welfare! (bloody scroungers /s) But they won't vote for a handful of popular policies; that's exactly what Ed Miliband failed with! 

I'll say this once ED MILIBAND DID NOT RUN ON A CENTRE-RIGHT PLATFORM. That is ridiculous. He was the most left-wing Labour leader since 1992. And he lost. Partly because he wasn't seen as Prime Ministerial (which Corbyn isn't either btw) partly because of the legacy of the recession and because of the SNP. But being the same as the Tories is not a reason. Remember, people Labour needs to win back went Tory or UKIP. To pretend that they voted right because there wasn't a 'true' left is crazy! I'm not saying move the right, I'm not a Kendall supporter. But moving to the left is suicide.

No actually I didn't, I said:

&gt;a single Islamist effecting politics in the UK from **within the political system**

Someone actually voting on bills and influencing things. Not just a speech the PM made and the media spin on it.

&gt;Rather than condemning Islamism for inspiring the terrorists, our PM said the terror attacks had, quote, ""Nothing to do with Islam.""

He said it was extremist Islam. 


&gt;The next day, when Charlie Hebdo published their new front cover, virtually every newspaper in the country refused to publish it, thereby capitulating to Islamic blasphemy law. People are scared to criticise Islam and Islamism either for fear of being called a racist or for fear of physical attacks upon themselves.

Or they just don't want to offend the 90%+ British Muslims who are religious but ""respect british values"" as Cameron puts it. It's not like publishing the cartoon would actually stop ISIS or anything is it. This has been been made to look a bigger deal than it is. 




&gt;Islamism has already undermined free speech in this country and will continue to do so under the false guise of ""tolerance.

No it hasn't, lots of places chose to print the cartoon, others had a choice and chose against it. It's not about tolerance, it's just about not needlessly offending innocent muslims who abhor extremists, especially when it almost certainly won't help anything.

Dublin is expensive but better for drinking and eating. Bloody crowded though which is a pain. I wouldn't say no to a well paid job down there but it's not a city to be skint in.

Both were way more culturally diverse with the food, drink and people etc. There is a bit of everything you could want normally without any silly background politics. It's also a major bonus being able to rent anywhere within budget and not have to worry about moving into a particular area because of your name and stuff.


If I could land the right job i'd be out, til then i'm happy enough with Belfast. It's not totally crap, I can wander from my front door up to hills, waterfalls and lakes. We're not too densely populated. Weather is mild (as long as you dont mind the rain, I got sunburn last week so its plenty sunny for a pasty guy like me). Reasonable enough cost of living.

It's exceedingly rare that the attack comes through the middle, at least when the ball isn't being played directly over the top.  When we do build up play, the final attack inevitably comes in the form of a cross that is usually well defended to a single player in the box.  That isn't going to work most of the time.

A lot of the problem is usually pinned on Barry, but there are huge problems at all three midfield positions against teams that require breaking down, rather than countering.  Of the defensive midfielders, Gibson is easily the best at initiating play, with Barry next but pretty far behind.  McCarthy, for all his value, really isn't very good at it.  Besic is worse still.  The entire center of the field compresses to account for their limitations, which results in either Lukaku receiving the ball 40 yards from goal, or the attack being funneled down the wings after the defense has had an opportunity to take shape.

You can live and thrive with McCarthy as cover for the midfield, but you can only really have one of him.  I believe either Barkley or Cleverley (or Gibson, but I've more or less lost hope there) eventually needs to make their way alongside, where they can press forward and force the defense to make hard choices.  Because those sorts of players can pose a problem going forward, teams will collapse onto them and you open up matters in the center of the field for someone who can make the final pass.",null,0,null,1439154941,null,null,false,0,ctx8wm7,null,t3_3gdvwa,null,null,null,t1_ctx7nuu,null,null,null,1440380551,null,6,null,Everton,t5_2qpfg,6,null

In my opinion the major factor has been that the Tories have so successfully pushed the narrative that the recession was caused by labour overspending, and that the only 'cure' is austerity.  Labour under Ed accepted too much of this narrative and it created the impression that labour mismanaged the economy.  Rather than try and counter that, the 3 mainstream candidates decided its too late, accepted it and moves on.  A lot of labours base see this as a betrayal and a shift to the right, exemplified by labour not opposing the welfare bill.  Part of Corbyn appeal is that he is resisting this lurch to the right.

Many of us on the left were willing to accept leaders like Blair (or potentially David Miliband), because they were able to resist the more extreme right wing policies.  If the centre of the party aren't wiling to take this on, why should I support them?  (I realize that Andy is now starting to claw back into that role).

Tldr: Problem was Ed not controlling the message, causing a lurch to the right by the leadership, causing the Corbyn backlash.

null,null,SylvieK,lfc99,,null,"I'll admit I was quite impatient with the team thoughout the match. I expected more cohesion and fluency than is reasonable for a season opener featuring so many new players. So now that I'm a little clearer headed, here are my thoughts:

* Lallana is redundant in the role he played today, and at best on this performance can warrant coming on as a sub for Countinho. Though I think he is mentally a very strong competitor, he was physically a step slower and too much of a lightweight. 

* Hendo &amp; Milner need Can or Lucas behind them to allow them to play higher up and free  Henderson up to push forward. 

* In general our shape and spacing looked much better when Can came on and we switched to 4-3-3 instead of 4-2-3-1. 

* Milner overall looked and played more like the captain than the vice captain. I absolutely love how physically committed he is to his performance, we absolutely lacked that kind of physical grit last season. 

* Benteke's first touch and hold up play were woeful I thought. I don't blame him for looking isolated or making only limited runs - that's more a product of the service he received. But the times when the service was decent, I thought his touch and movement were just bad. I expected more physical dominance in aerial passes, just didn't see it. I do think this will improve as our formation realigns and he gets more game time. 

* Firmino has a sexy first touch, but this was too short a time to judge 

* Clyne looked settled and calm, like he's always been stuck in there for us 

* Gomez had a rough go of it early on as Stoke were obviously targeting him as our weakest link defensively. That he stuck in the entire 90 minutes, didn't wilt under pressure and improved over the course of the game is incredible. The kid is 18. Very pleased 

* Lovren was good today. I REPEAT, LOVREN WAS GOOD TODAY. Deal with it r/LiverpoolFC. It's not the worst thing in the world for us if Lovren improves his game, and there is strong competition for the starting CB role.

Gomez struggled on long balls, but probably no more than Moreno would have (and flanagan did previously) but he looks a very talented fullback.

What we did badly: our attack was really very dysfunctional. First half we produced nothing, Lallana and Coutinho were poor, Henderson wasted in front of the defence, Milner.in some sort of slightly rightsided box to box role and Ibe very wide not showing much intelligent movement. I still think we have a problem integrating Coutinho's and Benteke's styles into the same team. I can very much see Henderson and Milner working well with Benteke if they are used in more attacking roles, and Firmino should do too. Coutinho I'm not so sure.

Second half particularly with Can on, henderson box to box and Milner in a wide attacking role we looked better. Fair enough for Milner to get a run centrally, but I don't think we should discard the idea that he won't be best in a wide role. Personally I think midfield 3 of Lucas(Can)-Henderson-Coutinho behind a front 3 of Firmino-Benteke-Milner looks very promising by giving Coutinho more space to work in, more freeedom for Henderson to attack, and two players around Benteke who can work off him intelligently.",null,0,null,1439155691,null,null,false,0,ctx9c0l,null,t3_3gdkqo,null,null,null,t3_3gdkqo,null,null,null,1440380753,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

I do agree but I would say that this is the nature of compromise.

The thing which frustrates me is a lack of direction from our leaders. Obama admitted there was no coherent plan and i havent hear cameron sat there is one either. They could be bullshitting but from looking at it, its just a mess.

In the case we cant compromise, or they refuse to. I dont think we have any other option to go on all out war.

Some of my suggestions: 

* It would be great to get a few sub regulars to commit to doing the pre, match, and post threads. Like schedule out the next 6 weeks of fixtures. I hate to say it but today's match thread was woeful - went up late and wasn't updated at all. There are plenty of regulars here u/hmurya, u/djimonia etc, who manage wonderful threads. If we could get a schedule and just have people stick to it, would be nice and less last minute. I'll commit to doing some pre-match threads. 

* As you mentioned, one consolidated stickied thread that goes up 2 days prior to match day that answers everyone's Where should I watch the game questions 

* Rivals Match thread - just need one on a game week basis I think 

* Table Probabilities - comes into play later in the season, I think it's Indiansuzuki's brainchild, lays out our potential finishing position prior to each game week 

* Throwback Thursday's - a thread that features highlights of old games/players/memorabilia

So under international law, the Spanish were acting illegally to enter Gibraltar waters. That's not a matter of opinion or debate, or sabre rattling. That's the United Nations Law of the Sea.

Why would Spain repeatedly violate Gibraltar waters? To demonstrate that they do not recognise Gibraltar's sovereignty, which incidentally was settled by international treaty signed by Spain about 300 years ago. If Spain could accept and recognise established international borders, then perhaps an agreement could be put in place to prearrange diplomatic clearance to permit hot pursuit across the Gibraltar / Spain border.

You support Arsenal -- it's fair to say you guys expect to win a fair number of matches in the course of a season, right?

Not just that you *want* to win them -- everybody wants to win.  You and the majority of the supporters of the big four *expect* wins.  You have the luxury of taking it for granted that most weeks, you'll walk away with your three points.

We do not have this luxury.

We're playing dead last Leicester?  Well you can goddamned well bet that we're going to let them ship three past us that match.  Burnley?  That's a tough match for us.

You get the point I'm making here?  *We don't get anything we can objectively call an easy match.*  There is no such thing for us in midtable -- our lads have to fight for every point, and we get shit on by pundits and bandwagon supporters of bigger clubs every fucking day.  We are genuinely surprised every time we earn three points in a match.

So yeah, we celebrate our wins uproariously -- and we pull off *this* kind of upset, we're gonna celebrate even more.  Not just the fact that we won, but the fact that we pulled off an upset that fucking *nobody* gave us a chance at winning.

You look at Wenger's face and how upset he was, and you see frustration.  *We* see the personification of that expectation I was telling you about.  

You're goddamned right we're going to celebrate the regicide of dropping one of the top four.

There is nothing to gain from downvoting and censoring people apart from to make the type of people who enjoy a circle jerking echo chamber being just that. All of the uk political discussions could do with being polite and more tolerant on both sides.

After all the Tories won the election, it might do people some good to listen to them and try to see their point of view and learn from it. Otherwise the discussions on here become totally useless because in real life when these discussions are had it never represents what goes on here. In reality and off reddit, Tory mentality has a far greater weight to it and it is silly that those views are just downvoted here because people do not like them. It just makes the reddit a little fantasy haven for left wingers who then, as we saw in May, get quite a shock come election time.

Look at it from their point of view. Let's say that a developer has 10 plots of land that they could build 10 houses on each on in a given year. If they build all 100 houses, the sales price for each would be (prices pulled out of my ass) £200,000. If they only built 10, then the price of each could be £250,000. Either way, the cost of the land, process, building etc would be the same. Let's say that's £125,000.

Also, those 10 plots of land took time to be nurtured, have planning consent provided, etc. If they blow their wad in a single year, they can make £20,000,000 and spend £12,500,000. but then they have to refill the pipeline of available land with planning consent, which takes time.

If they instead release 1 plot per year, they make £2,500,000 and spend £1,250,000, then continue to do the same next year and the year after that, filling the pipeline from the back so they have a steady stream of over-priced houses to sell. It makes more sense to speculatively purchase a plot of land and hen slowly drip-feed new houses onto the market

we have a good squad but the premier league is incredibly conpetitive. there is no way predicting where we will land because the midfield is so staggered. one thing that i know is that we simply are not top 6 material when it is about consistency. never really were. and that's okay. at least we are one of the clubs that is not a complete corporate sellout. we will challenge for the better positions but it will nit happen every season. we have to accept this because this is modern football and we are still playing by older rules... and you know what... i'd rather have us in the championship than in the hands of someone who changes the way we are. trust me, i have seen it first hand when red bull bought salzburg and eradicated its history.  
  
when we are realistic about things, we have to accept thay our place will be somewhere between six and twelve. better seasons see us closer near europe, but it is simply not a given and not something regular. the teams who qualify for europe regularly are almost completely in the hands of foreigners or well, had the luck of producing a one of a kind player they sold for crazy money. we simply cannot compare with these clubs. and we have to admit that it is not only us doing a good job nowadays... other teams also have become better and done tremendous work when they used to be bland. look at stoke and swansea. it's pretty much amazing what they have done in the recent years.  
  
don't get me wrong. we should always challenge and I am sure that we will. demanding Europe on a regular basis is extremely unrealistic though and we should be even happier when it happens instead of looking at the competition through pink glasses.",null,0,null,1439157917,null,null,false,0,ctxakjn,null,t3_3gdvwa,null,null,null,t1_ctx9mfc,null,null,null,1440381401,null,7,null,Everton,t5_2qpfg,7,null

His role, as far as I've understood, is to play in the hole behind Austin, providing him with service and passes so that he can get some shots on goal. With no other striker on the pitch, he's meant to be the second most offensive player we have. 

Problem is, he drops too deep to pick up the ball, and then when he does receive it, we more often than not end up going even further backwards. For all of his energy, good dribbles and insightful passes, by the time he's distributed the ball, we're 10 metres further back than we were when he received it. He'll skip past two people beautifully and find a pass in an open area. Except that open area is for the left back just inside the half-way line, while we were just outside the box when he picked it up in the first place.

As for the deadball deliveries, his free kicks have looked sharp but his corners were terrible.

The first reason being the FPTP voting system leading to people not voting for the party they want but for the party that has the best chance of kicking out the candidate they don't want. E.g. X is a Lib Dem supporter but the Lib Dems came a distant third in his constituency in 2005. He wants to vote Lib Dem but he's scared that 1st place Tory candidate may get in if he ""wastes"" his vote on the Lib Dem candidate, so he votes for the 2nd place Labour candidate to give the best chance of kicking the Tory candidate out.

That, however, doesn't explain the huge drop in Lib Dem support from 2010 to 2015 since the above was true for 2010 as well. So I would hypothesise that people like Lib Dem policies, but wouldn't vote for them because they don't believe they'll get Lib Dem policies but Tory policies or Labour policies instead.

My parents generation were very lucky in the sense that they had no tuition fees. The original idea was that you'd go to university, then come out with a higher paying job, thus pay higher taxes and contribute back to the system. That doesn't seem to be happening any more. I know far too many graduates with excellent degrees doing jobs that didn't need degrees in the first place. I'm sort of lucky in the sense that I have a graduate role that will offer me progression but it's not the best paid.

I have no issue with paying towards university, but the majority of these loans are not being paid back. I'd be much happier with a graduate tax that contributed solely for the next generation to go to university, but that's just me, I don't think everyone would be for it. 

It's no surprise though that the younger generation feel they're being hard done to. It doesn't just stop there though.

Housing is a major issue. My parents didn't go to uni; had jobs that weren't the best paid, but somehow were able to secure a mortgage and pay off a house in full within just a few years. I don't feel the youth of today have that same opportunity forwarded to them.

In summary, I don't think it's surprising they feel there's unfairness. When compared to other generations, our youth are paying the most for further education, simply for a chance.

It's possible to go through clearing as a mature student (indeed, I admitted such a student through clearing last year), however I suspect that your impediment here is completely irrelevant to the clearing process.

Some courses (and, indeed medical being among them them) have a lesser propensity to accept mature students in general, and broadly require formal qualifications.  Speak to the academic staff/registry department at the universities you're interested in again to confirm this is still the case for the clearing period, but I suspect it probably is.  Some universities (like us) generally take mature students onto either a foundation year, or the HND, with a view to giving an opportunity to prove themselves, and top up to a full degree if everything works out.

A) Many people appear on Russia Today, would you make similar comments about him appearing on 'Murdoch controlled' media? I never said nor do I think he helped facilitate peace, I'm saying the method he advocated was used and worked. I agree about Miliband they were tired - did I give you the impression I think otherwise? :p. Fair enough about Kosovo, he was mistaken on that no argument here. This is the issue, nearly every politician has this sort of association. Cooper and Burnham the Iraq war for example, or this current government and it's selling of weapons to Saudi Arabia. I don't agree about most of his foreign policies being insane, they are positively sane compared to the current and recent foreign policies that our governments have used. 

B) Fair enough!

C) I think Labour are screwed either way with this. If they carry on accepting responsibility they are screwed and denying responsibility they are screwed too. Either choice will be bad. Why not choose the truth?

D) I see what you mean, I just sincerely don't think any of the other candidates will do better. They are doing badly when all the odds are stacked in their favour and no one is interested in them, so I struggle to see how they'd have a wider appeal. Some of the newer MP's would be much better IMO. Clinton will win as she is a 'safer' better, she's better funded and she's a woman. I still think whoever it is they will beat the Republican candidate. My personal feeling is that Hilary Clinton will be America's next president. 

E) I love you too (wait what?)

F) Yeah got my years mixed up sorry, was gonna edit after but thought it would look dishonest. I still think Boris won because of personal popularity, you could argue that people rejected the Tories but accepted Boris. He is very personally popular nobody can deny that. I think if I was Labour I'd really hope Osborne is the next Leader of the Tories and not Boris. Osborne is to Cameron what Brown was to Blair - not much personal popularity. I think you are taking pragmatism too far now, MP's should be allowed to vote with their conscience and that's something that politics is missing. Look at how abstaining of the Welfare bill worked out for Labour if you feel voting with your conscience is always bad. Oh yeah I don't think the public supports Corbyn on everything. Just that he hasn't got all these radical policies, many (not all) are common sense that the majority of people support. Others aren't. This is the case with any politician, you can't please everyone!
Well we won't agree on that one then. I do not think the manifesto was that left wing, and I don't think how left or right the manifesto was was the main reason Labour lost. The other reasons we mentioned were more influential. Most people don't think in terms of left or right. The point is if people think that you caused the issues with the economy and that cuts have to be done are the only way (and you don't properly contest this), if they think your leader isn't prime ministerial, and they think you are too similar to the other party, they won't vote for you in enough numbers. We can argue that going left is bad all day, but the direction Labour took under Ed did not win, and Cooper/Burnham will carry on with this direction and lose, they will also lose with Kendall. They will probably lose under Corbyn, but I think he's the best chance - no point in arguing this last point as we won't agree!",null,0,null,1439159133,null,null,false,0,ctxb8tw,null,t3_3g7rs7,null,null,null,t1_ctx8j7y,null,null,null,1440381719,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

All very small probabilities. But when you add up a few of them, and then consider that it only needs to happen once in (I don't know how many years you have to live) it adds up to a still-small percentage that isn't negligible.

Is a plain bizarre scenario, I understand Israel is merely a place-holder antagonist but their actions make no sense.

Look at the mortgage default crisis in the US.  After many many homes were foreclosed (bank-owned and vacant) and the supply in the chain was finished there was a ""surplus"" of vacant homes.

However, prices did not fall enough for all the homes to be filled as the investors in the new houses were better off holding out for prices to comes up rather than sell at a loss and move on.  So it took years for counties to stop foreclosing and vacancies to return to normal levels.

The main point I'm making is, I think, the problem is not only *volume* but rather more importantly, housing corporations ought  to be *non-profit*

Laptop is in used condition. A few cosmetic signs of use and a couple of scratches, but I thoroughly cleaned the cooling system. Runs at below 70c under extreme loads. It has no hard drive or OS but if you want I can grab a 750gb HDD for it and install win10 for an extra £50, or free if you're offering a really nice monitor.

 * CPU: i7 4700MQ
 * GPU: GTX 765m
 * RAM: 16GB 1600MHz
 * Screen: 15.6in 1920*1080 matte finish

pics coming soon

I'm currently in South/Central London. I'd prefer not to ship as I don't have the original box so shipping will be kinda difficult. If you need me to ship I'll probably use an old GTX 970 box

As for the monitor I am asking for, I am running NVidia GPUs so G-Sync is a bonus. I am not fussy about brand or used/new as long as it is in decent condition

Gomis is a more than decent striker and Fabianski is a splendid goalkeeper. Ashley Williams, the captain, is pretty good too.

&gt; Needing skill and effort to be able to understand text does not speak well of the writer's skill

Yes and no, I think. On the one hand, gratuitous barriers to understanding are pointless at best. On the other hand, too much accessibility can lower the level of discourse (by lowing the level of thought). The following lines from T. W. Adorno - whose ideas about writing I do not unreservedly accept) express that last point.

&gt; A writer will find that the more precisely, conscientiously, appropriately he expresses himself, the more obscure the literary result is thought, whereas a loose and irresponsible formulation is at once rewarded with a certain understanding. [. . . .] Vague expression permits the hearer to imagine whatever suits him and what he already thinks in any case. Rigorous formulation demands unequivocal comprehension, conceptual effort, to which people are deliberately disencouraged, and imposes on them in advance of any content a suspension of all received opinions, and thus an isolation, that they violently resist. Only what they do not need first to understand, they consider understandable; only the word coined by commerce, and really alienated, touches them as familiar.

null,null,mistlet03,null,null,null,"Moisturiser twice a day, a gentle cleanser in the morning, maybe during a bath/shower, and a chemical exfoliant are probably where you want to start. If you're not a fan of having to do a complex routine every day, you could try out a 10% concentration peel used once or twice a week- SR skincare has a 10% salicylic acid peel that has good reviews. 

Moisturising is generally good for your skin- dehydrated skin can become oily very quickly, and can feel dull. Moisturising after washing your face in the morning and before bed keeps it vibrant. Gentle cleansers remove impurities from your skin, which can become acne, and chemical exfoliants remove dead skin, and penetrate through the oils on your skin to remove harder to reach impurities deep in your pores without causing the damage that physical exfoliants can cause, and are one of the most recommended ways to prevent acne. 

Many people recommend Boots' simply sensitive cleansing wash as a gentle cleanser, and Simple's moisturisers also have good reviews, and they have plenty of variety depending on your skin type. Is it dry (patches of flaky skin), oily (becomes greasy/oily, especially on your forehead, and nose quickly), a mixture of both, or none of the above? Figuring out your skin type can help you pick out products which suit your skin best. 

As the other poster said, introduce new products one at a time, and patch test everything, so if your skin reacts badly you can tell what's irritating it and stop using it. Also check out the sidebar both on here and the non-UK sca subreddit, as they contain lots of useful information and product recommendations.

New Zealand's dairy industry is currently fucked.  FTFY.

The majority of the milk produced by New Zealand is sold through a company called Fonterra, which is approximately a cooperative of dairy farmers, though there are now outside investors as well.  The price Fonterra pays farmers per kilo of milk solids is now $3.85, which is, for almost all farmers, below the cost of production.  It was $8.40 in 2014.  The price is set by means of an international auction.

New Zealand was booming, then some other folks noticed, in particular the USA, and they ramped up their output, possible because their farming has all sorts of internal subsidies, and so now there is too much milk around so priced have dropped, good old supply and demand.

You're right in so far as there are no openly Islamist MPs working to pass theocratic legislation through parliament. Fine. That doesn't change the fact that the influence of Islamism has undermined our freedom of speech, which is a core principle of Western democracy. 

Actually, I believe it may have been Francois Holland who said the attacks had ""Nothing to do with Islam"" after Charlie Hebdo. Since he is a figurehead of the West, my point still stands. Here's what David Cameron has said on the issue, however:

""They are killing and slaughtering thousands of people... they boast of their brutality... they claim to do this in the name of Islam, that is nonsense, Islam is a religion of peace. They are not Muslims...""

Which really isn't any better. Not Muslims? That's just objectively untrue. 

Here's why I think you're wrong about it just being an issue of offending Muslims. Firstly, 90% of British Muslims don't respect British values since polls show at least a quarter of them had some sympathy with the Charlie Hebdo attackers. Sympathy for terrorism is not a British value last time I checked.

But more importantly, after Charlie Hebdo, the Islamists won. Do you honestly think the papers didn't publish the cartoons because they cared about the feelings of Muslims? Do you really think the Daily Mail cares about the feelings of Muslims? The DM don't give a shit about the feelings of every other demographic and minority in this country, particularly immigrants. No, the media didn't publish those cartoons because they were AFRAID. That is why free speech in under siege by Islamism. 

But if I haven't convinced you, listen to two far more articulate men than I discuss what really happened after Charlie Hebdo and decide for yourself whether you still think Islamism isn't a problem in Britain.

1) ""I am the Doctor and THIS IS MY SPOOOON"" when he tries to write comedy he ends up hitting preteen ""lollll rannnndummm"" moments/dialog that makes little to no sense and is honestly pretty painfully lame and unfunny to me. Maybe if the spoon was at least used creatively but no, the Doctor just used it in a way that would blatantly cut his hand. If you are going to go for something odd and quirky like that it has to not be blantantly stupid as well for it to work. 

2) Clara refers to the Doctor multiple times as a full blown hero. This doesn't fit with the events or resolution of the previous episode at all, it doesn't fit with the character arcs at that point, it barely makes any sense in context of the season as a whole. This is a consistent issue for him. 

3) they save the day by shooting the side of the spaceship with an impossible shot from a golden arrow. None of this makes any sense, it doesn't follow the internal consistency of the episode where the gold clearly needs to be melted and put into the engine to be used AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE GIANT VAT OF GOLD THE VILLIAN FELL INTO. If you are going to disregard the way our real world works on a fundamental level to have them shoot a bar of metal like that that far, accurately and fast then at least for the love of god maintain consistency with the rules you yourself make up. 

Add in the fact that none of his episodes have had any sort of spark, have anything of consequence, he's never had a moment in an episode that stayed with me, his dialog is flat and uninspired, his side characters are completely forgettable and he definitely has moments of idiocy...

There is a moral difference between accidents and murder

&gt;I mentioned the IRA because their terrorism specifically demonstrates why Farage's argument was utterly baseless. Farage's contention was that voting for UKIP's policy of closing the UK's borders and taking back immigration policy by leaving the EU would solve these problems.

No, it would solve ISIS getting in. Or make it harder. He spoke about ISIS. You're dragging all other kinds of terrorism in, which I pointed out are not the issue today with the list of terror attacks. 

&gt;During the period the IRA and numerous other terrorist organisations were active in this country we did have complete control of immigration, a heightened terror alert status, military deployment, and tight immigration policy - and we were less safe than we are now.

Because they were internal, so tighter immigration would have no effect. Or maybe not, who is to say the IRA would not have seized upon immigration to get allies or sell drugs, weapons abroad more easily?

So the steps the British government took against IRA were specified for the circumstance. Just as better border security would be specified for ISIS.

 * RAM: 16GB 1600MHz

I'm currently in South/Central London. I'd prefer not to ship as I don't have the original box so shipping will be kinda difficult. If you need me to ship I'll probably use an old GTX 970 box

As for the monitor I am asking for, I am running NVidia GPUs so G-Sync is a bonus. I am not fussy about brand or used/new as long as it is in decent condition

Is it ""harder"" to drive a car? i have no idea how anyone controls these massive things, when i sit in peoples car and observe the mirrors i'm amazing they can see whats coming up behind them. Driving them seems simple enough, its just maneuvering them in spots like parking lots and stuff. 


Sit in the drivers seat. Rear view is better than on a bike (if correctly adjusted). Side mirrors should just have the edge of the door in them, more mirror looking to the sides. Rear view should contain the back window. On a nomal car, the mirrors should be a good size. Other cars, they can be tiny. I'm always amazed by how *awful* the mirrors in my dads sports car are (putting it on the drive), but then again, I drive trucks and am used to big mirrors.

Bear in mind, learning to drive a car will be harder than the bike. Moving the clutch, throttle and brake from your hands (sensitive, easy to apply varying pressure) to your feet (feel less, used to clodhopping about) may be weird. Wear thin shoes (like converse) until you start to get used to it. After a while you'll be able to drive in toecaps.

Right now you can get your money out pretty quickly but if interest rates rise then your loans will become less attractive for someone to buy off you as they can get a new one at a better rate. Therefore, if you want to take your money out you will likely have to sell them at a discount (possibly significant).

2. Our government continues to sell arms to islamist regimes.
3. That this paragraph is the best (or worst) strawman I've seen today:

&gt;But for those who I have come to call Europe’s regressive-left how could Islamist tyranny—such as burying women neck deep in the ground and stoning them to death—possibly be anything other than an authentic expression of Muslim rage at Western colonial hegemony? For don’t you know Muslims are angry? So angry, in fact, that they wish to enslave indigenous Yazidi women for sex, throw Syrian gays off tall buildings and burn people alive? All because… Israel. For Europe’s regressive-left—which is fast penetrating U.S. circles too—Muslims are not expected to be civilized.

4, That this quote:

Cops arrive 1-2hrs after the 999 call - hoods still stood a few metres away from the house, their weapons strewn across the floor (fingerprint evidence?) - yelling death threats and all sorts of obscenities when the boyfriend was talking to the cops about what happened.

***Zero arrests.***

Cops came to my mothers house the next day and told the boyfriend that he would probably be best moving out of the house as ***the cops knew the people involved and who they were connected to*** - cops hmm'd and haa'd about prosecution until we got a letter a few months down the line saying that they couldn't be prosecuted (despite being repeat offenders, fingerprint evidence, **still being on the scene when the police arrived**, police knowing who they were etc).

null,null,llammmmma,null,null,null,"That's not really true - this house was built in 1786, in the new town of Edinburgh. The floorboards are inch and a half thick solid oak. The walls are 26 inch solid stone. That's 66cm. About the length from my shoulder to my finger tips. It's like they were building the pyramids. The internal walls are 10.5 inch of solid brick and mortar. No cavity, interlocked brickwork. The doors are 50mm thick solid oak. The entire roof is made of oak, all the planks and all the rafters. The joists are 3 inch by about 12 inch and about 30+ feet long. Some beams are 12 inch by 12 inch and 30+ feet long. I learned recently that the wood is naturally rot resistant because these hardwoods have a natural anti-microbial action in the wood. As far as I can tell it's the same roof as they put on 250+ years ago. 

I've been told by a surveyor that the rebuild cost on this home would be **at least** £4000 per sq m. but he said that really there's no way you could rebuild this house as it is, because you simply couldn't source the quantity of oak in the equivalent sizes because all the big oak trees were cut down 200 years ago. So that £4000 value is just the cost of reinstating the ""modern equivalent"". 

And this is a flat. My neighbour has ENORMOUS Quad ESL floor standing speakers, They're aobut 7 grand and are about shoulder height. I never hear anything (except if he's got them on really loud - because then you can hear them down the street.) The ceiling is lath and plaster and the plaster layer is at least 3 inches thick. And then on top of that they filled in the void below my floorboards with clinker and what I think is coal dust. It's very very effective. We basically cant hear anything from downstairs at all. 

My wife's step dad's house cost around the same as this, down in Calne in Wiltshire, 5 bedroom detached place built about 10 years ago. It's made of paper and plastic.

The last time I was there I had to fix both toilets and one of the door handles just broke in my hand. Instead of brass plumbing fittings they'd used a type of plastic which in one toilet had become brittle and cracked by the rusting metal fittings (rusty metal inside the cistern) . In the other toilet it was a plastic pipe connector that had just cracked because it had deteriorated in the air. That flooded the kitchen as well. The walls are so thin you can hear everything from all the rooms. You have to turn the TV right down if someone goes to bed. The whole house appears to be quite decent from the outside but the reality is that it's completely shit to live in.

It's got double glazing but you can hear through the walls. 

I rented a room in a new build in Milton Keynes a few years back and from the kitchen on the ground floor you could clearly hear the people talking/shagging/whatever on the 3rd floor. Quite embarrassing when you meet the flatmates new (massive, noisy, screamer) girlfriend and you've all heard the liquidy sloshing sounds coming from the 2 of them the night before.

I watched the builders making the next row of houses opposite and when the terrace was basically finished they then put bricks around the outside of the structure to make it look like the houses were made of brick. The actual house was just timber frames (cheap thin pine) with plasterboard and breezeblocks to seperate the neighbours. (I think they used breezeblocks but I'm not even sure. You could hear people sneeze next door.

My parents house was built in the 1800's.. again it had enormous thick stone walls. Same as this house. Oak everything. Standard stuff in those days. My parents said the new houses they built opposite (in the early 2000s) had to stop a party last week because the floor couldn't stand the weight of the people and the neighbours had complained to say the house was moving because they were dancing. They only had 15 people in the house.

I wouldn't live in a new build - unless I designed it.

null,null,CastrosExplodinCigar,,Randalstown,null,"Moved to the states near 10 years ago. I do miss Northern Ireland occasionally, then I read some of the shite people on here spout/post and I realise thank feck I've left. I do make it back once a year for pleasure and once a year for work.

I got tired of listening to barstool republicans in student bars who were born too late to take part in their fathers ""cause"". I'm fed up with teenage loyalists who decided not to work because being in a paramilitary group was a better job prospect. I got fed up with politicians making the same argument year after year after year. 

One of the things I do like about the states though and it's in reference to what someone else said about this post. You know the areas you don't need to go into, about 5 years ago I was walking up the Ormeau Road from the centre of town after a night out, an area I have walked through countless times over the years and never felt threatened and about 5 guys came at me and my wife a hammer. They came out of a side street and just thought it was funny to attack us with a hammer. This was 2230 on a Thursday night. I know something similar to this happens in every city in the UK but the Ormeau just before the bridge on the way up it is not a dangerous area. Just some spides off their tits on glue or something. 

I do like the states. There's a mentality over here that you can do anything you want and if you work hard you will succeed at it. Once I got married and didn't need a job to sponsor me anymore, I and a colleague started our own Comms agency (It's still going but I'm now a silent partner/consultant). I don't think I could have done that back home although we do have a few Irish and UK clients. 

Also, people in the UK and Ireland are ripped off when it comes to clothes, cars and tech. There was an article in the Guardian I think last year and they discovered it was cheaper to fly from London to New York, buy an iMac or a MacBookPro and bring it back than it was to buy it in the UK. I drive a Lexus, a car which I couldn't dream of owning in Northern Ireland but the repayments over here are less than £250 a month.

Problems are though, Americans work and if you don't look after yourself. No one else is. When I was working in the company that sponsored me, I worked 50 weeks a year. We had Xmas day off and back to work on Boxing day. American holiday time is shite. Workers rights are almost non existent as well.

null,null,8thave,null,null,null,"I think most would agree with most of what you said. Here's where I differ:

* Dier is here to stay at CM. I'm not in any position to say whether or not it's the correct call at this point, but just look at the lack of transfer activity. If no one else is signed, Dier is needed much more in midfield than he is at a position where we have Jan, Toby, Wimmer and Fazio (say what you want but good 4th choice IMO). Clearly the likes of Bender are probably not coming, so even if someone is signed, I'm not saying it will be Stambouli level, but it will probably not be someone established enough to push Dier back to CB indefinitely. Especially when we are relying on such inexperienced guys in Bentaleb, Mason and Alli. No matter who we sign (if we sign a CM even), I can easily envision Dier getting consistent Europa minutes at least in midfield. For that reason, I think the change is permanent (for this season). It's not like Poche has proven to be a flexible in-season manager... And based off of yesterday's performance, even though Dier is clearly better utilized as a CB, I am comfortable with him in CM given what little we've seen so far from Wimmer and Fazio.

* I think you're way too harsh on the attack, and Chadli in particular. You don't play Dembele and Chadli up there and expect massive creativity. You have Chadli up there for his goal scoring/finishing prowess and Dembele for his dribbling/maintaining possession. Link up play and one-twos are great, but the decision made was a much better chance for a closer match that gave the underdog a chance to steal at least a point. I thought Chadli made really good runs and simply did not have the Danny Rose type help to provide a threat on the wing that he would usually get. You hardly saw Chadli at all during the first half hour when Spurs were thriving, but you saw a lot of him as the game went on. He adapted and made his presence felt even as the team around him had a slight drop in performance.",null,0,null,1439178616,null,null,false,0,ctxlvpf,null,t3_3gdt9j,null,null,null,t3_3gdt9j,null,null,null,1440386797,null,2,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

&gt; Mr Clarke's lawyer would otherwise have advised him to refuse to answer all questions put to him so as not to say anything which might be used against him at a later criminal trial

To proceed with a prosecution after the accused has given evidence that might harm him, only because he was assured it would not harm him, may be considered 'offensive to justice' (from [here](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/reconsidering_a_prosecution_decision/#abuse)):

&gt; Only in rare circumstances will it be offensive to justice to give effect to [the public interest that those who are reasonably suspected of criminal conduct should be brought to trial]

&gt; Such circumstances can arise if the police, who are carrying out a criminal investigation, give an unequivocal assurance that a suspect will not be prosecuted and the suspect, in reliance on that undertaking, acts to his detriment.

Even then, it will depend on the facts of the case, whether those facts would have come to light without the driver's cooperation, the severity of the offence, and the likelihood of a successful prosecution. So far, the inquiry 'has heard' that he fainted 'while working as' a bus driver (not necessarily while driving), and a claim that he 'lied through his teeth' about his medical history (though not whether anything he allegedly lied about would have prevented him from getting a licence, or just meant he had to fill in more forms and have more expensive examinations).

For most I would say the use of 'his' going unnoticed is down to the fact that there are huge numbers of historical uses and that it is widely accepted in dictionaries, thus perpetuating it. I'm not saying that the historical usage of 'his' in this sense doesn't have an inherently sexist origin, just that the lack of use of 'her' in times past causes it to stick out nowadays as a result. Hence, choosing 'her' makes it appear as if the author is making a pointed statement which does concern gender.

Moreover, the uncommon usage of 'her' can simply distract away from the overall drive of the statement at hand.

This is why I always, in both speech and written form, go for using 'their' or 'ones' (I don't care what Virginia Woolf says, if it's *its*, it's *ones*); it is because they (particularly 'ones') convey the exact meaning I desire.

&gt;Losing out on a transfer target to Stoke - if it indeed comes to pass - is pretty humiliating and highlights the club's rapid decline in standing, especially as it doesn't appear to have been the first time this summer that they have missed on out a key potential signing.

&gt;Roberto Martinez spoke of his desire to add to the squad before the deadline after the Watford game on Saturday - a result and performance that has only caused concern amongst the support about the state of the squad.

&gt;But as yet another target seemingly floats by supporters have good reason to question just what is going on in the corridors of power at Goodison Park.

If I've understood this correctly, you asked your mechanic to look at your back brake because you had little to no stopping power. Your mechanic then said there was nothing to check because there was no rear disc brake.

WTF.

If you go to a mechanic and say there's a problem with your brakes, no mechanic worth their salt would let you leave without assessing the problem and either fixing it or at the very, very minimum explaining it. They are your goddamn BRAKES.

Also, for what its worth, I can say from experience that the rear brake on the CBF125 has plenty of stopping power.

Drum brakes in general on not inferior to disc brakes because they are less powerful.

Drum brakes are inferior to disc brakes because they do not shed excess heat as quickly as disc brakes so under heavy sustained breaking they will tend to fade. This is not at all likely to happen to you on a CBF125 unless you are going down a long (think 1 mile +) descent and dragging your rear.

There are some other quirks of drum brakes that you should be aware of too, they ""self servo"" which means that as you apply the brakes and they begin to grip they apply some of the energy being dissipated into applying the breaks harder. Its a mechanical power assisted brake.

This can make them a little harder to modulate than disc brakes as they tend to be less linear in their braking force.

Also, they can lock up more easily when they are cold. If the drum / pads have moisture or condensation on them it can cause them to be a little ""grabby"". This combined with the self-servoing can mean that if you are not careful, the first time you apply the brake on a cold morning the rear wheel may lock up. Releasing the brake will fix that, it wont lock on permanently.

Its not something you need to be concerned about, just be aware of it. 

In short, the CBF125 does have a rear drum. It is a perfectly adequate rear brake and its well worth learning to use both your front and rear brakes properly.",null,0,null,1439187866,null,null,false,0,ctxpo2s,null,t3_3g9fw6,null,null,null,t1_ctx6hx5,null,null,null,1440388647,null,3,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3,null

First things first, when you arrive (and have ditched your parents) just knock on the door of the person next to you or check out your kitchen/pantry to see if anyone else is there. In terms of starting conversation have a few questions to ask. You'll be meeting so many people they'll become pretty standard and everyone will be asking the same:

1. Hi I'm /u/scottishrainbowchild (they should introduce themselves, if not they're the awkward one and you can ask)

2. Where are you from? 

2b. Have you ever been where they're from, if so chat about it. Find some common ground. 

2b. If that was further away than Edinburgh chat about your journeys

3. What are you studying? 

3b. Is it interesting to you or totally alien? Do you even know what BBC Oral Health Sciences is? Find out more about it. 

If things are going well and you like the person:

4. [Freshers' Week events](https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/eusalive/whats-on/) , what have you seen that you fancy? Chat about what you're thinking of doing. At this point none of this has to be firm plans to go together. Just see what they're interested in and again try to find common ground. 

You're probably a ton less awkward than I was starting out but it took me until almost the end of the week to understand that everyone feels as awkward as you do so just keep meeting people and doing things. Turning up to events alone is the best way to meet people and if anyone is horrible that's fine you can just avoid them from there. 

The one problem you might have is being 17 for the first few nights everyone tries to go to Potterrow for its club nights. You can get in there and any other Union no bother. Then they'll probably want to go explore other clubs later in the week. You won't get in there if you're not 18 and clubs will be checking in Freshers' Week. If you go with you're probably going home alone unless someone is super nice. I'd recommend just heading out with your halls and whoever is going if you want to go out. If you're in Pollock they all go together, if you're self catered there's probably someone to go with. Just remember that while the can go out clubbing you get to have an epic 18th birthday party in the middle of first year. Win some lose some!

null,null,theinspectorst,null,null,null,"&gt;the major factor has been that the Tories have so successfully pushed the narrative that the recession was caused by labour overspending

I often hear Labour supporters making this claim. Could you point me towards some examples though of prominent Tories saying that 'Labour's overspending caused the recession'?

My hunch is that this is a sort intellectual deceit on the part of some Labour supporters to avoid having to engage with the actual arguments on Labour's economic record, namely:

1. Labour's under-regulation of the banking sector (and active promotion of 'light-touch' financial regulation) caused the financial crash that led to the recession.

2. Labour's tax-and-spend record (you might simplify this to 'overspending' or 'undertaxing' depending on your right/left views, but they're two sides of the same coin) caused the deficit that the Coalition inherited to be as large as it was.

Labour were averaging a deficit of 3% of GDP in the 3-4 years before the recession, at the peak of the economic cycle, when they ought to have been overseeing at least a small surplus. If you're not capable of running a surplus at the height of a boom, when are you capable of running one?

And if Labour had run small surpluses (say, a surplus of 1-2% of GDP) then the deficit, which peaked at 11% of GDP in 2009, might instead have peaked at a lower level of 6-7% of GDP - not a trivial number, but making the need for austerity less pressing and giving the post-2010 government more leeway to pursue a slower pace of fiscal consolidation.",null,0,null,1439191102,null,null,false,0,ctxqoeo,null,t3_3gcx0w,null,null,null,t1_ctx92b1,null,null,null,1440389122,null,1,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

&gt;Tony Pulis, the head coach, concedes he cannot provide any guarantees Saido Berahino will reach the end the the transfer window as a West Bromwich Albion player as Manchester City take a closer look at the forward at The Hawthorns tonight.
Berahino has been watched by City scouts and, with Edin Dzeko bound for Roma, Manuel Pellegrini’s side look short in the striking department — it will leave Wilfried Bony and Sergio Agüero as their remaining senior options to lead the line — heading into their Barclays Premier League campaign curtain-raiser with the West Midlands club.
Tottenham Hotspur have also been considering firming up their interest with an offer for the England Under-21 player, although West Brom’s valuation of close to £25 million is viewed as prohibitive. Albion’s interest in Salomón Rondón, the St Petersburg forward in what would be a club record of about £15 million, places further questions over Berahino’s future at the club.
Pulis remains eager to keep hold of one of his stellar players yet money, he admits, ultimately talks. “Never say never in football because you just don’t know what’s around the corner,” the Welshman said. “For me to say, ‘We’re going to do this’, ‘we’re not going to do that’ or ‘that is set in stone’, is not going to happen. Who knows what is around the corner in this game?
“He’s a good player and we want to keep him at the club. I believe another year of playing regular football at West Bromwich Albion will make him a better player and a stronger character but that’s my opinion. He’s got two years left and at the moment he’s with us and we’re very pleased he’s with us and we’re hoping he will stay.”
If he can keep hold of Berahino, Pulis plans to pair the 22-year-old with Rickie Lambert, their new signing — whom he hopes will lighten the burden on the Burundi-born player after the Midlands club leant heavily upon him for goals last season.
“It is exciting,” Pulis said. “Last year we relied a lot on Saido’s goals but Rickie has a really good goalscoring record and we’re hoping he will add to what Saido did last year.
“It will definitely give us another threat. I hope he can help Saido. That’s one of the reasons he’s come to the club. We’ve talked about bringing in senior players and good characters and he’s a good character. I think Saido will learn a lot from him.”
Pulis maintains City’s true title credentials can only be judged once the transfer window has closed on September 1. The same, he says, goes for his own side and their own aspirations with the head coach eager to further strengthen despite the arrival of Serge Gnabry, the winger, on loan from Arsenal with Rondón set to follow.
“I think City will do some business before the window closes,” he said. “In fact I think most of the top teams will. The next three weeks will determine how strong or weak most teams in this league are.

I have no figures on this though, it'd make for interesting reading. 

One problem I find with smaller venues in the UK though is pure greed from the owners and the fact that way too many of them won't spend money to spec smaller venues properly so you have a ton of small venues in the UK that sound and look shit because the gear ( sound system, mixing, lighting ) in them is shit. 

Then they expect people to pay good money to go and see something that looks and sounds fucking awful. 

I do a couple of tours a year of these smaller venues, I call them toilet tours. As a sound engineer you're walking into venue after venue that is nowhere near spec'd well enough to do the job. 

Funnily enough though many small venues in Europe ( France, Germany, Poland etc. ) don't seem to have this issue as the owners actually care and therefore are prepared to spend money on the correct equipment.

What this would mean is you could potentially still take advantage of the grant rather than loan.

It would mean that you could work quite happily in a digital  agency, with programming skills and the added bonus of production/media. 

I turned 20 the day I went to uni. I went because it was the last year before the increase in fees and I didn't have anything better on the table at that point. I did 2 years of a theatre degree and dropped out. I now work in digital marketing, something I gained a passion for over a number of years, and the time studying theatre taught me a lot of valuable skills and it also helped me to be 100% sure that industry wasn't for me. Being a 'drop out' has in no way hindered me; in fact I have found employers are actually quite respectful of the fact I had a good go at that path before identifying that it wasn't right for me before investing further resources in it!

Good to see an injury free Walker finally get a pre-season under his belt properly, looked much, much better. Dealt with Young and Shaw well. Desperately unlucky with the goal (if anything he just tackled Rooney too well).   
  
I thought Dembele was ok, not a player I like seeing on the wing though. You can tell it's not his natural position he offered very little protection for Walker, Toby and Dier had to come and help out a lot, especially first half.  
  
Defence. We looked so solid and calm. In the past whenever a team broke on us you could sense this feeling of panic and then they'd score, but this weekend even when they got through there was a sense of calmness and we just dealt with it... Could see all our defenders talking to each other a lot more than before, Alderweireld i particular was really good.  
  
In attack, we were missing something. We made some decent chances (the Eriksen lob attempt being the best). Kane looked decent on the runs he had and Chadli looked faster than he has before imo but frustrated a little.   
  
Our pressing looked improved. Saw someone here somewhere say they thought we pressed when we needed to and sat back when we needed to which I thought was spot on.

The course is maths based and you should mention that you are good at and are interested in maths, especially since you'll have written about a lot of your programming experiences. You should mention the Google thing. But you really should mention stuff on the actual course - go read some relevant books, or blogs, or something, which shows that you have an interest *in this course*,which is much more theoretical than others, and isn't just computers and programming. 

No, you shouldn't mention anything more than about 3 years ago, unless it is an ongoing thing. It won't be relevant, and they will wonder why you haven't done anything recently. 

Do very, very well on the MAT. It is very important, and if you look at the statistics, it's clear that they pretty much chuck away people below a certain threshold. Get about 60 minimum. Aim high. This will be what you have most control over. It will show the interviewers that you aren't stupid if you happen to keep getting wrong answers in your interviews (but you still need to demonstrate that you can think logically in the interview).

The antecedent  that ""we must live inside our means"" is fine. The consequent that ""*therefore cutting the deficit should be our top priority*"" is one of those Orwellian forms of double speak. Lets assume the deficit is important. Even if it is, having good quality education, healthcare, social care, jobs that pay well and all the other things that make this country a decent place to live are vastly more important than the deficit. The argument may be that we need to cut to protect these things (which I don't subscribe to as a relatively modest short term tax on the super rich's wealth would write of the deficit) but the deficit is an economic limitation, not a goal in and of itself.  

Even the most ardent right winger would agree. We *need* trident and to keep up military spending. We *need* to spend millions on royalty and pageantry like the Olympics or the jubilee.

I don't disagree with that, but I think it's important to recognise that there are a lot of things you might not encounter as a hobby programmer. If you want a job coding web apps, then yeah you can probably do that without a degree without too much issue - but other fields (anything scientific/embedded/games) will probably feel like an uphill struggle without a background in maths/physics/comp sci, unless you fall into an extremely supportive team who want to train you from nothing.

I'd take the gap year personally - do a bit of everything, see what you really enjoy.

null,null,gamas,,Labour Member,null,"Yes, a MULTILATERAL nuclear disarmament is something that should be done. And if we can convince every other country to give up their nuclear weapons at the same time, then we can scrap our own. A move towards the scrapping of nuclear weapons is one we've been working towards for the past 3 decades. 

A unilateral disarmament, however, is foolish. To think that if we just do it first, all the other countries will follow is woefully naive. The fact is, we are a high profile target and there are quite a number of countries that could benefit from us being wiped out. The whole point of the MAD principle is to make the cost of launching a nuke so great that no-one could possibly think that it is worth making a strike. The only person in the planet who may be insane enough to still launch a nuke against a great power with nukes, is Kim Jong Un (we're just thankful North Korea doesn't actually have the resources to actually build a properly functioning nuke).

The whole point of a nuclear deterrent is to convince those who would even consider pointing nukes at us that there simply isn't a good case for it.

Tl;dr no-one wants a world with nukes, but as long as we're a high profile target, with enemies with nukes that would prefer we didn't exist, we have to have something that says ""look, if you try to nuke us off the planet, you risk annihilating the human race, is it really worth it?""

EDIT: And yes it woul be a much better world if every country just sat round a negotiation table and came to a mutually beneficial agreement. But sometimes, people have completely unreasonable demands and aren't interested in mutual cooperation. There's no way to negotiate with ISIS, there's not way to negotiate with Kim Jong Un, and there is (debatably) no way to negotiate with Putin, as they aren't interested in what other groups think, they only care about their own interests. Therefore, the purpose of a nuclear deterrent is to make it their interest not to launch a nuclear strike against us. It won't stop our country being destroyed if they do launch nukes at us, but it also removes any benefit from our enemies from even thinking about launching nukes at us.",null,0,null,1439197068,null,null,1439200754,0,ctxs739,null,t3_3gcdhw,null,null,null,t1_ctxh21s,null,null,null,1440389839,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

If we geographically distributed them near perfectly, and required them to live where we told them for at least 1 generation, we could assimilate them easily.

But for others, it'd be hard. For them we'd have to offer other ways for them to keep busy. School/University would be the best way. 

If we were doing that we could make sure that ghettos aren't created, and that the refugees assimilated properly into European life. 

However it:

* Requires huge expenditure. 

* Requires us to basically imprison them to a certain area.

null,null,BonzoTheBoss,null,null,null,"&gt;I think the former elects a more popular leader, while the latter elects a more effective leader.

I think a contributing factor for this is the nature of head of state. In the U.S. the President is head of government AND head of state, so they have more executive power. In the UK, the Queen remains our head of state regardless of who is head of government. Technically all government positions derive their power at the grant of the Queen, as all authority flows from her (it is ""her Majesty's government) but in practice everyone knows if she ever actively went against a legitimate elections result she'd be ousted pretty quickly.

I am biased, but I think I prefer the UK way. While some object to the heredity based position of monarch, I think the alternatives aren't necessarily better. At least the Queen is politically neutral, so we keep the childish bickering away from the office of head of state. And theoretically she can step in at any time and simply dissolve the government, if it turned out they were doing something truly horrific, so she's a silent safe-guard against tyranny. But then I suppose the Constitution serves that purpose in the U.S. I think the difference being that the Queen can think for herself and use her constitutional powers at her discretion, unlike the U.S. Constitution that is often interpreted in different (sometimes contradictory) ways.

Even if we abolished the position of monarch, we'd still need a head of state, those costs don't just disappear with the Queen. And personally I shudder at the thought of a ""President"" Cameron...

&gt;I'm very impressed that so many countries could look past their differences and histories to come together to form a European-wide organization. It's an evolution I wish we could come to in the US with our foreign policy.

Part of the problem is that the EU isn't as united as it would seem on its front. The whole trouble with Greece has highlighted that. It's given Euro-skeptical powers (i.e. The UK Independence Party, or ""UKIP"") plenty of ammunition over the last few months. There's supposed to be a referendum on whether we should leave the EU or not in 2017, something I am not looking forward to at all. I can see arguments both for and against and I don't really feel qualified to make that decision, let alone the millions of cretins that would also be voting. I thought the whole point we elected professional politicians was so that they could take the time the general population cannot to become educated on world affairs and hire experts when their own knowledge lacks? Turning the question to the public just turns it into a popularity contest, which is pointless IMO.

The EU may appear united but it's pretty obvious that it's dominated by Germany and France, with Germany more so. Germany's economy booms under the Euro because it is undervalued compared to their former Deutschmark and so they can export more easily. The problem arises when poorer countries join whose former currency was weaker than the Euro was. I am referencing Greece, of course, but also Italy, Spain and Ireland have all suffered. It doesn't help that Greece probably fudged the numbers a bit to get their EU application through, so in some ways it's their own fault, but I don't think millions should be made to suffer for the mistake of a former government.

And now we have Germany (or more specifically, Germany's financial minister, Shaüble) insisting on crippling austerity measures, when even global economics experts cannot decided firmly one way or another if such policies are even worthwhile long-term! The usual poster child pointed to as a success story of austerity is Ireland, but Ireland and Greece are not directly comparable and it is disingenuous to pretend otherwise.

Sooo yeah, I'm not sure how ""united"" the EU will be in the next couple of years, and honestly I'm not even sure if that's a bad thing or not. Greece's narrow near-miss of an EU exit shows that the single-currency experiment may not be as stable as predicted, and I am not sure if the EU can endure a collapse of the single currency.

&gt;Easier access for protest parties. Unless you're a Democrat or Republican, you're not going to win national elections (with a very few exceptions).

I'm not so sure. Yes, the Scottish National Party has had a significant increase in seats in this Parliament. The SNP are/were seen as the alternative or ""protest"" vote against Labour, as Labour are being seen more and more center-right than their traditional left/center-left, but that's changing with Labour-leader candidate Jeremy Corbyn who may or may not change the publics attitude towards Labour if he wins. My point is that despite all that over **60%** of the country did NOT vote for the Conservatives, and yet they somehow won with a ""majority"". First Past The Post is NOT worth a god damn in that respect. But then I suppose it's better than nothing.

My own experience, as a European citizen coming from Canada to the UK (no credit history, no UK bank account, not much cash):

* Getting a bank account was the most difficult thing, as I didn't have an address. If you find a bank that can accept your work address as your temporary address, that might help
* Finding apartments was not hard, finding apartments available _now_ was harder. We just couldn't wait 2 months, and we couldn't afford most of the one available right now. But that was in London, in a less dense area, it might be easier.
* Papers: I ended up renting directly from a landlord, who used to go with AirBnB, but wanted to have someone for a longer period. This was the best for us: not much hassle and not many papers to provide. But when we saw the agencies, we were simply asked for payslips, and sometime a bank statement. We also got a recommendation letter from our previous landlord, thinking it might help.

If you're looking for a uni with a brand name I'd be very surprised if they let you in without a good maths A level at least, some might ask for another science subject too. There might be courses out there that dont require maths but you'll need to scrutinise their value. It might be the case that although the subject is respected the degree itself isn't that useful (which is the case for unaccredited engineering degrees). Having the right degree can help get your foot in the door but it's never a guarantee of anything. A good film studies degree *may* trump a second-rate comp Sci degree, you'll need to do some careful thinking. 

If that is the route you want to move down but you're more interested in practical skills than academic study, a software engineering degree might be something to think about, perhaps even an apprenticeship (if such a thing exists. I really don't know enough about this area to guide you properly). 

Bear in mind most people don't end up working in the subject of their degree. Jobs in film and TV might be hard to come by but you're not excluded from jobs in HR, consultancy, PR, marketing... Most grad jobs are menial office work that dont require any special skill set. They're not exciting, but if we all got to do what we wanted we probably wouldn't be paid as well. 

As for your question, I never really decided what to do. Last month I graduated from an undergraduate master's degree in physics and in October I'll be going back to start a PhD. Id always enjoyed physics and knew I'd neve decent job prospects when I finished so I never had the same problem as you. During my time there i got an internship with a big pharmaceutical company doing shit office work and decided id like to do something technical when I finished. The following summer i applied to several things and ended up having to make a choice between safety engineering for nuclear submarines (which I realised was not as exciting as it sounds once I got to the interview) or a research placement in the ultrasonics group at my uni. I chose the latter, had an enjoyable summer despite the project not really going anywhere and at the end of it got offered a PhD position. It was a good project with industrial funding, so I wasnt really going to do much better if I was going to do a PhD, but because the industrial partner wanted to secure the project, had to accept in December well before I'd had a chance to get other job offers. So here I am. Although intellectually it's everything id want from a job, I could earn a lot more money doing something boring in an office in London. I don't want to go into academia, and while the industrial prospects in the field look good, I'm not guaranteed anything and still don't really know what I want to end up doing. I just kind of fell into this and tbh I'm happy to go along with it for now, because I've been an office drone before and I'm not ready to sell my soul for financial security just yet.",null,0,null,1439199001,null,null,false,0,ctxsnpx,null,t3_3gfsko,null,null,null,t3_3gfsko,null,null,null,1440390056,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,MrJohz,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,null,"I went to university in 2010 to do physics.  I did physics mainly because I'd always done fairly well in science subjects in the past, and I didn't really know what else to do.  The first year went quite well, more by luck than effort, but around January of the second year I went through a depressive episode, and ended up coming to terms with the fact that physics wasn't working for me - I wasn't interested in the course, it was getting progressively harder, and I was beginning to fail more than I was passing.

So, twenty  years into my physics degree I ended up switching to computer science, and so far it has been fantastic.  Being able to think about what I really enjoy and want to do has been really helpful.

Advice, then:

- Student finance are painful to deal with, but they will give you enough for the length of your final degree plus one year.  So if you do one year of one course and switch to a different course later, student finance will pay for that first year.  On the other hand, if you do two years of your first course, you will need to pay one year's worth of tuition fees (although you'll still get your maintenance loan).  If you do decide that your course isn't right for you, do it in the first year if possible.

- That said, if you're certain you want to go for compsci, it's almost certainly going to be cheaper to take a year out beforehand.  Tbh, that's usually a good sign - students that have demonstrated that they're willing to work are much more likely to get good degrees.  Don't be afraid of resitting.

- What you do as a degree does not have to decide what part of your life will be your career and what part will be your hobby.  Of my recently-graduated friends, one biologist is going into primary education, while another historian wants to teach SEN English.  I know someone who did a conversion course from maths to computer science and is now a software engineer, and someone who didn't work out that he wanted to be a nurse until his mid-thirties.  Don't worry!

Other countries like Poland were also heavily damaged - and yet we don't see the same bounce-back Germany had. 

I think in reality German sucess boils down to lots of things;

* Post-war their debts were essentially written down - and as the new front line of the cold war Germany saw a lot of infrastructure spending from the Allied powers - and to an extent even from the USSR.

* Germany has been an industrial powerhouse for a long time, even before the war. The war helped speed up mechanization in Germany which they really ran with post war. Although some German cities were heavily damaged, much of the country escaped as well.

* The Germans are industrial leaders, with a highly skilled and intelligent workforce. Here's a little thing to think about.

null,null,penurious,null,null,null,"&gt;I often hear Labour supporters making this claim. Could you point me towards some examples though of prominent Tories saying that 'Labour's overspending caused the recession'?

You're right, I'm simplifying, asked directly Tories have actually been arguing that too much borrowing intensified the scale of the recession.  My problem with this is that the continual emphasis on 'crazy' spending creates the impression in the mind of the electorate that spending is responsible for the recession.  The hollowest example is Cameron's election debate attack on Liam Byrne's letter.  If you accept that the ""we've run out if money"" letter is sincere and it's a problem, its a very small leap to say that this caused the crash.  The fact is Ed had to come out and explicitly deny this in the election campaign, as the idea was so widespread.  

On a side note the reason the Tories are making the argument, ""this is a lot worse because of Labour over-spending"", rather than ""this is all caused by Labour under regulation"", is because they have no interest in financial regulation, they want to push for lower spending and a smaller state, which they see as an end in itself. 

&gt;My hunch is that this is a sort intellectual deceit on the part of some Labour supporters to avoid having to engage with the actual arguments on Labour's economic record

I'm happy to engage with those arguments.  The fact is that under-regulation had catastrophic effects on the stability of financial markets.  Blair and Brown were responsible for this, as were the preceding Tory governments, whose ideology they inherited.  

&gt;And if Labour had run small surpluses (say, a surplus of 1-2% of GDP) then the deficit, which peaked at 11% of GDP in 2009, might instead have peaked at a lower level of 6-7% of GDP - not a trivial number, but making the need for austerity less pressing and giving the post-2010 government more leeway to pursue a slower pace of fiscal consolidation.  

Arguments about whether Labour should have run a surplus are fine, in all likelihood we'd have a lower deficit now had that have happened.  The problem is that we were in an expansionary phase, and virtually no-one in the mainstream of politics predicted that a crash was about to happen. With hindsight it is easy to attribute blame.  The Tories were in fact promising to match Labour spending:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6975536.stm 

&gt;Labour were averaging a deficit of 3% of GDP in the 3-4 years before the recession, at the peak of the economic cycle, when they ought to have been overseeing at least a small surplus.

Again hindsight.  Major's government ran a higher deficit (as a % of gdp) than this in every year in office.  Thatcher also ran comparable deficits in most years.  

&gt;And if Labour had run small surpluses (say, a surplus of 1-2% of GDP) then the deficit, which peaked at 11% of GDP in 2009, might instead have peaked at a lower level of 6-7% of GDP - not a trivial number, but making the need for austerity less pressing and giving the post-2010 government more leeway to pursue a slower pace of fiscal consolidation.

I don't really know if I can be bothered to have this argument as my general point is about narratives, but my position is that the differences in the deficits between the figures you give aren't as important as you make out.  It goes to show how successful the Tories have pushed the message that austerity is necessary, that it's expected to be a part of any dialogue on the recession.

Edit:  Last couple of words.

My advice to you is do a degree that interests you AND is likely to make you employable. If you don't enjoy it and are doing it purely for a career you will fail.

Remember however that your A-Levels aren't everything. I'm currently doing an evening degree in Maths with some people that failed A-levels, and everyone is storming through the course. Once you have a few years work experience under your belt, the A-Levels get less important. 

If you don't know what you want to do, try getting internships in the fields of interest and see if they really are what you think they are. We've all been through the 'grass is greener' situation, invest a lot of time getting into a career, and then think 'this is shit, what did I do this for?'.

null,null,synthesezia,,Belfast,null,"Posted this before:

London, for a few reasons:

* **clubbing** - as ridiculous an excuse as it seems, I'm well into electronic music and the scene in Belfast is about as monotonous and boring as minimal techno. London has way more choice and each weekend there's something to do if I'm bored, with something I really want to go to at least once a month. I was flying over here to go out or go to festivals a few times a year so I'd met a fair few people who already lived here and are regulars at various nights so I was able to move over here with a bit of a crowd.

* **career** - I'm a web developer. There were 2 companies I wanted to work for in Belfast and I was already working at one of them and knew everyone who worked for the other one. The company I worked for was having troubles paying the wages and London seemed to have way more opportunities. I moved here for a job expecting the grass to be super green but in reality got let go from that after a month and then worked somewhere that bored the tits off me. Less than a year into that I managed to get a job at one of the most exciting places in the UK to work for and I'm pretty happy here.

* **events** - I've already talked about clubbing but everything else like comedy, art, theatre, museums is obviously amazing here. Even random shit going on is way better. I walked out of my flat one day and found a New Orleans style jazz band playing a cover of 2 Unlimited - No Limit. You wouldn't get that on Malone Avenue.

* **politics** - After a while it really grinds you down. I'm really not sure if there's been any major steps forwards in NI since I left nearly 3 years ago and I follow the news pretty closely. London and England is by no means perfect but it's less bullshit than back home.

* **change** - Belfast is the same old stuff, week in, week out (near enough) with the same people. I grew bored of it, that's all.

There are downsides though:

* **rent** - paying 700 for a room in a shared flat is the norm. I paid that for the middle sized room in the grottiest flat I've ever lived in sharing with 2 horrible human beings. I'm in a houseshare now with mates and have the biggest room and pay 760, it's a lot nicer though. The wages do make up for it though. By simply moving here I got paid an extra £9k. I had a similar amount of money leftover after rent as I did in Belfast.

* **settling here** - only move here if you're OK with the thought of never owning your own home in London. You'll need to move in with a SO or earn a shitload of cash to even have a chance of getting a mortgage. 2 friends tried to get a house with their combined income of ~£90k and couldn't get one.

I'm unsure how long I'll stay here. Maybe go to Berlin or the US next depending on work. I'm highly considering going contracting as my wages will basically double overnight if I do that and saving up for a few months to go travelling but who knows.

If you consider Belfast to be too quiet and boring and are OK with paying stupid amounts of rent to be able to stay out all night drinking cans of Red Stripe for £4 a dark room in a converted warehouse listening to repetitive electronic music you'll love it.",null,0,null,1439201573,null,null,false,0,ctxt94r,null,t3_3gdsmq,null,null,null,t3_3gdsmq,null,null,null,1440390337,null,3,null,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3,null

I was impressed with the way we started in Saturday's game, however the own goal killed the rest of the first half off for both teams. We were defending for the most part of the last 20 minutes of the first half and it shows how well Poch has done with defence in the summer as we probably would have shipped a few goals had this been the defence of last season. But the team look together, sharp, happy and up for the fight.

I believe that we faced a fundamentally average Man U on Saturday, and it was such a shame to see both Eriksen's shot in the first 5 minutes tip over the bar, and the eventual own goal. Bentaleb made a catalog of errors in the game and his substitution was perhaps 10 minutes too late. Walker showing promise as he did extremely well against their left wing, however everyone will remember the OG. Just goes to show how determined he was to get back and take the ball off of Rooney's foot, because he did, just not in the direction any of us would have wanted.

On the face of it, had Eriksen scored and we'd retained the defensive mindset like we did, I have no doubt we would have taken 3 points.",null,0,null,1439201623,null,null,false,0,ctxt9ib,null,t3_3gdt9j,null,null,null,t3_3gdt9j,null,null,null,1440390342,null,2,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

null,null,Lucifa42,null,null,null,"My understanding would be:

Any interest or fees because of late payment would have to be agreed in advance of the loan by both parties. You don't have an contract so it was never agreed, unless done verbally which is difficult to prove.

HOWEVER!
If she continues not to pay, or you are not happy with whatever payment schedule she proposes and you can't come to a mutual agreement on it then you can take her to small claims court to force her to pay.

At that point you can add on [8% statutory interest](https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/work-out-interest) from the start of the loan and include your costs of bringing the claim such as the registered letters (costs are limited in small claims though remember).

So up to you on how you want to play this out.

1) Inform her of the 8% statutory interest you'll be entitled to claim should this come to court and how she'll lose because she has already admitted she owes the money. Use this as a threat that if she doesn't agree to the 2% it will end up costing her more.

2) Don't inform her and hope she continues not to pay and therefore you can charge 8% at court.

Whatever plan you choose, only correspond by letters from this point onwards as you may need the paper trail. Use the phrase ""without prejudice save as to costs"" in bold at the top of any letter. This means these letters can not be used in evidence in court such as ""you were willing to accept 2% interest earlier, so why 8% now?"".

On the specific questions; money is fungible - if there's foreign investment focussed on London property (because of the ""London brand"", familiarity, risk profile or whatever) then it could free up UK property investment in other areas of the country? Is there any research on whether that happens?

Like it or not, we operate in a globalised economy, and London is a global city. To me, it doesn't matter where the investment comes from, and it's a positive that London is seen internationally as a worthwhile investment target on the supply side. The video correctly highlighted the risks of local populist politics destabilising that.

I'm not sure there's much point in encouraging investment where there isn't a supply problem, and tax taken from the London investments would be used for development projects across the country. If the government manages to influence the demand side for other areas then investment will follow.

Also: it's not just Everton's first game, it is everyone's first game, so beginning of campaign excuses for a poor performance are rubbish. Watford had six players making debuts and didn't look bothered about needing time to gel. Furthermore, if you gel under a crap system what's the point?

Conceding early is a problem, full stop. Maybe you lose heart, maybe not, but it's a massive problem either way. Always coming from behind to snatch a point is a fairy tale; winning teams take the lead and bury their opponents.  What I saw in this match and last season was a lot of conceding early due to useless Martinez tactics and then pulling one back when the team was allowed to go for it instead of playing Roberto ball. Lack of depth at certain positions notwithstanding, this is a good squad and can at least score some goals. If everyone were fit there would be some juicy squad selection dilemmas, but still the defense is a nightmare. 


I don't mean to be entirely doom and gloom, but it blows me away when fans won't admit the massive, blatant, alarming flaws in Roberto's philosophy, his inability to adapt, and his habitual lack of a Plan B.

This will be changed as soon as possible, I've made it my mission to update the sidebar much more regularly than it was as you can hopefully already see. This morning I've gotten familiar with how the CSS operates and I've succesfully managed to update the crests to include the Europa League logo (as you can see on the fixture list) so I'll add in the newly promoted teams to that next and then work on the player pictures and then start on something regarding flair.

You know one of the major reasons why Spain originally claimed the treaty was void? Because the British allowed Jews to live in Gibraltar. Good luck defending that line of argument.

That's why there is no agreement, because both sides have cases they can argue based on treaties, and you're not going to reach an agreement by appealing to old treaties, you're going to reach it when the two sides actually agree.

As for the 'catch drug runners' argument, are you saying that chasing smugglers is a valid reason to violate another country's territory? Any country, or does it just apply when Spain does it to Gibraltar? If so, why are those two countries treated differently when they're both 'sovereign'? If not, does Gibraltar get to send police to Spain to chase suspected criminals? Does Spain get to send police to France in pursuit of smugglers? If catching drug runners actually *is* more important than territorial integrity, then it doesn't matter who is doing the chasing - getting the smugglers is actually more important. Greek police in Denmark, Swedish police in Portugal, and the FBI absolutely bloody everywhere. And then we get to the question of whose laws decide what is an illegal drug - where the chase started, where it ended, whose police did the catching? Whose courts try the accused? Are they tried where they were caught, in which case what happens if they broke no laws in that country, or are they tried in the country that was chasing them, in which case why bother having extradition treaties when you can just chase the people you want to catch wherever they go (oh, wait, the CIA already do that...)

It would turn into a huge mess, with countries sending their police anywhere they feel like, and police taking it upon themselves to decide who to chase and where, and what laws to apply when they get there (use of lethal force, anyone?) and Russia sending troops into Georgia and Ukraine to, er, hold on...

So the 'catch drug runners' excuse for violating another country's territory is a non-starter, because the moment you say decide it's acceptable, the implications are huge and anarchic, and there *will* be massive abuses (unless you trust the North Korean police - do you trust the North Korean police?)

But you know what you could have? An agreement between two nations, or within a group of nations, to have a common set of rules and procedures for handling what happens when drug runners cross borders. The first step to reaching such an agreement is 'ok, where are the borders?' And Spain does not recognise Gibraltar's territory, which means such an agreement can't be reached, and we're right back where we started.",null,0,null,1439202675,null,null,false,0,ctxtilw,null,t3_3gddr6,null,null,null,t1_ctxcrge,null,null,null,1440390461,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

However, that completely misses the point that under a Keynesian economic model, debt is meant to fall during the good times (1997-2007) through repayments.  This means you have much greater freedom borrow it back to spend when the shit hits the fan (2008-2010).

null,null,AimHere,null,null,null,"The Parliamentary Labour party will probably contrive do him in somehow. He (or rather the fact that the leader is now voted entirely by party members in a OMOV election) is a direct threat to their careers, since the Blairites and the 'centrists' have just discovered that they can't just appoint 'one of us' to the job and get it rubberstamped by the rest of the party machine.

Something like this turmoil happened in 1981 - when Labour started to take power away from the Parliamentary party by opening up elections to the members and unions. Half of the careerists - the guys with no support base outside of fellow right-wing Labour MPs -  took fright and jumped ship before the Deputy Leader election campaign, forming the SDP. The other half voted for Benn to (in their view) sabotage the party, then jumped to the SDP. It's the treacherous careerists of this ilk that Corbyn will have to deal with first.

It'll be interesting to see what today's crop of hollow Labour powergrabbers do to keep their grip on the top echelons of the party. One thing they have is the bulk of the Parliamentary party. Corbyn is going to have to stuff his shadow cabinet with a few people far to the right of him, not (as is usually the case) for Party Unity, but because there aren't that many left-wing Labour MPs left in the party for him to pick from. They'll be well placed to screw him over merely by leaking his plans, causing gaffes and all that stuff, and it'll be hard to pull off a proper purge of disloyal shadow cabinet members if they get caught, given the numbers.

The security services may get involved (they always have a bunch of MPs in their pocket) to help them out, if they're even needed at all, but there'll be no need for an assassination, if that's even something they do outside of Northern Ireland-type situations. This sort of stuff is much safer and more deniable.

If Corbyn gets elected as Labour leader he'll be in for a *very* rocky ride from his peers, and that will likely widen the ideological gulf between the Party membership and the Parliamentary party - particularly since there are tens of thousands of new members who just signed up purely to support Corbyn.

Like you I prefer sheer (enough to even my face out a bit but not enough to hide my feeckles) and I've had no issues there, just took a few tries to get the amount right. 

The MUFE Chromatic mixes are liquid though so you'd be adding liquid and pigment to tour BB cream. Keep in mind they sell two types, one is water based the other oil based so you'll need to match it up to the type of foundation/ BB cream you use- the oil one can be used with silicone based stuff. That would be the most important thing than if your BB cream is high street or high end. I didn't mean to imply that you should be buying more expensive BB cream for them to match you, but that buying an adjuster (albeit from a bit more of an expensive brand) would probably work out cheaper as you can experiment with the foundation type stuff you already own. 

Edit: just wanted to add that I have two face things one matches me in paleness to my paler winter face, the other to my darker summer face, and I mix them up with the ochre to varying degrees depending on my tone/undertone.

You could even buy a bottle for your table for like 50 euros (probably only just over double what it costs). The doormen were all just regular guys, no moody bastards dressed all in black. There was no dress code. There was no pretentious trying to make it feel exclusive or that you were ""lucky"" to be allowed inside such a venue. The only way you'd get kicked back is by appearing too drunk. 

It was all very relaxed but it all worked without problems, no moodiness or people falling about causing trouble. It just all seemed to work. What's more the décor and lighting was awesome and tasteful, none of this neon edgy shit you see in the UK. 

10 euros to get in was totally worth it, especially given the building it was in is prime local real estate and around building worth 10s of millions.

null,null,ik00p,null,null,null," &gt;Firstly, the composition of a FPTP parliament is very rarely an accurate picture of public opinion. Where are all the green and UKIP MPs for starters? 24% of the electorate (not even counting those not eligible to vote etc) chose tory, yet the tories got over double this in terms of percentage of MPs - more than a bit unrepresentative I would say!

1: Saying everything is about individual votes rather than community votes is Thatcherite as hell.

2: The public decisively voted against an alternative to FPTP in a national referendum so clearly they feel represented this way 

3: Corbyn is going to have to win under FPTP so whether it works or not isn't the point. 

&gt;Secondly, the commentator in the video is making a very valid point, that the 'de facto' centre ground has been shifted rightwards for nearly three decades, and majority public opinion is very often aligned with things that JC is saying, e.g. renationalise railways etc. If you want to talk about circle jerks and echo chambers, just look at the Westminster bubble, and the gaping political-spectrum chasm between three Labour leadership candidates who want varying levels of tory emulation, and the single candidate who wants genuine social democratic policies (that the public say they want too).

Well yeah because the world has become more globalised, people feel less attached to their communities and neoliberalism has been proven to work. Like king Knutsford,  Corbyn can't turn back the tide.

Also I must add that MPs understand public opinion more than anybody else. They spend hours per week knocking in door, hosting surgeries and going to community events. The reality nationalisation isn't a vote winner but cutting welfare is. Nobody, nobody becomes a Labour MP to emulate the Tories--they join because they see winning elections as the best way to spread social justice.

Hi guys!

So I recently bought some new parts to replace some that I sold (I regretting selling them in the end!) but now I've decided I want  a better GPU to power my gaming as I feel sometimes a bit lack luster with my 970 and I want to upgrade to X99.

I'm looking to sell the following items,

* Palit Jetstream 970 - £190
* Asus Z97-P - £40

Luckily, our other major party has the exact same split, in reverse: A right-wing traditionalist wing, and a centrist wing of more moderate politicians.

If both party's centrist members broke off and joined forces, we'd be left with a left-wing, tax-and-spend, labour-focused Labour party, a right-wing Conservative party focussed on minimal government and protecting wealth, and a centrist party that tried to amalgamate the two ideas and come up with something practical.

This would be clearer for voters and for MPs. It'll never happen, though, because neither of the more polarised ends of each party command enough electoral power to be a useful voting force without their centrist colleagues. It's a sticky mess, and both major parties are imploding.

Generally car insurance companies do not check if their customers have valid MOTs (we ask our customers and take their word for it if they say ""yes"" unless we have reason to believe they are lying), so not having an MOT does not necessarily mean there is no insurance.  Not having an MOT could invalidate the driver's insurance, if it is found that the MOT would have been failed, and the cause of the failure is also the cause of the accident (e.g. bald tyres).  The insurance company would say that the driver's failure to maintain their car is a recless disregard for their own responsibilities as a driver.  HOWEVER, the insurance company will still have a duty to you, the innocent party, under the Road Traffic Act.  So they could reject their own customer's claim, but generally speaking it is very hard to reject a legitimate claim from an innocent struck by someone who had insurance at the time.

null,null,HJonGoldrake,eng-GreaterLondon,London,null,"&gt; I'm no historian but I am pretty sure the railways were built privately and nationalised during WW1?

The original railways of Britain were almost entirely built by small private companies, yes. They remained essentially private (with brief periods of public control in wartime) until 1945, when they were fully nationalized.

However, the railway system that Britain possess today is not the railway system that was built all those years ago. After the railways were nationalized in the 40s, massive regeneration of both track and stations took place, the rolling stock was switched to diesel and electric from steam. The network, which was still a patchwork of mostly short lines that had been the heritage of the small companies that had originally built them, was rationalized (many say that too many secondary and rural lines were axed).

In short, the modern British railways are very much the product of significant public investment over a period of five decades. However, the railways themselves *are* still publicly owned (through Network Rail); it's the service that is privatized.",null,0,null,1439204767,null,null,false,0,ctxu1lq,null,t3_3gg0fw,null,null,null,t1_ctxss6i,null,null,null,1440390709,null,21,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21,null

null,null,Mordisquitos,lancashire,Manchester,null,"&gt;The other funny thing is that there's some villages on the Portuguese border that rightfully belong to Portugal, but Spain currently have hold of them. ~~The EU have asked them to hand them back over~~, but the Spaniards say that the villages want to stay in Spain.

I don't believe the strikethrough part is true at all. Have you got any trustworthy sources on the EU taking that position?

The issue of the villages between Spain and Portugal bears more resemblance to the ""dispute"" over Berwick-upon-Tweed than that of Gibraltar, Ceuta or Melilla. That is, nobody actually cares except for a few excentric nationalist irredentists who occasionally try to bring up the issue.

As someone on the new loan scheme, I'm still concerned. These repayments bite most when a person has a middle income but lots of outgoings such as a mortgage/family/ect. Prepare to meet a lot of cash-poor 30-somethings in the future.

The three most viable alternatives are to either (1) make loads of money doing something like finance and make repayments asap after graduation whilst living at home, (2) leave the country and never come back or (3) never settle down. Obviously these are all quite extreme options and would only be rational in similarly extreme conditions. Maybe we should pray to politicians to bestow a graduate tax instead.

Yes, the talent is there... but from what I have seen is that for him, it's always about himself. [At Bayern, his lack of understanding the system they played led to massive misunderstandings and his decision-making was often very bad, so it was pretty much sure that he had to go](http://www.watson.ch/Sport/Spielverlagerung/649409618-Guardiola-ist-zu-Recht-sauer--F%C3%BCnf-Dinge--die-Xherdan-Shaqiri-bei-Bayern-taktisch-falsch-macht). (Link in German)
  
The link basically shows us all his shortcomings: Lack of good movement in the positionings, decision making when passing, his behavior in the last third of the pitch, his running-ways in combination play &amp; his judgment of game-dynamics. Honestly, do we really want a player who has proven that he has the skills but lacks the brains for it? Bayern and Inter wanted him out ASAP because yes, he can turn around games on a good day of his... but also bring utter chaos and dis-harmony on other days. Let's leave those players to Stoke. They have proven that they can handle those kind of players (Arnautovic) and make them at least semi-viable.  
  
Honestly, it reads like he is very good, ability-wise but a team needs to be built around him very much and cope with his shortcomings in order to abuse him to his best (like in the Swiss national team). In order to keep him happy because he has proven to be some sort of a diva and us happy, we really need to do quite a lot. Martinez will weigh the pros and cons and personally, if he goes to Stoke, good on him - I am certain we have other options.

Between how shoddy and depressing these places are where you can't really socialize, and online stuff like Tinder cutting into a nightclub's main role as a ""hook-up venue"", this is unsurprising news.

As is their ""appeal"" such as it is is quite fleeting for most people anyway.  

Break the ice on Tinder, meet up at a pub with friends, have a vaguely decent drink without pushing past a throng of sweaty people, have a good time, go home and bang.

Back when pubs closed early and before the internet, or when the internet really took off, they were a necessary evil.

Plus night clubs have a drug scene to them, and apparently kids these days take less drugs. Getting wrecked doesn't seem to be a thing that young peeps are into as much any more.

On the other hand, the whole UC plant wasn't particularly safe, but it didn't really fall foul of any laws because its India in the 1980s and so there weren't really any laws that covered plant design and safety etc (as for most countries at the time). There is also the fact that the Indian government permitted a shanty town to grow right next to the plant. It can therefore be claimed that the Indian government should take a lot of the blame.

null,null,SeamusRyan,lfc68,,null,"Well essentially, there are very broadly three ways a team can play when out of possession: in a high press, a medium block, or a low block. The term block refers to placing banks of defence between the ball and the goal: so in this case our block was two banks of four between the ball and the goal, where the back four was one bank and the midfield 4 of Ibe-Henderson-Milner-Lallana was the the other.

In a medium block the players would be instructed to engage with the opposition as they entered our half of the field roughly, and in a low block they would be instructed to engage with the opposition before they approached the 18-yard box. In a high press the players would be looking to close down the opposition in their own half and win the ball back in packs, so that's slightly different as it focuses on winning possession of the ball instead of placing banks of defence between the ball and the goal.

So in the first half when we were out of possession we made sure that we had our two banks of 4 behind the ball most of the time and we usually waited until the Stoke players made their way into our half to engage them in possession, and then at 60 minutes with the introduction of Can, Henderson Milner and the front 3 all attempted to chase down Stoke in packs which meant Stoke found it very difficult to retain possession or build from the back.

Hope that clears up the term for you, I'm sure there are a few inaccuracies there but that's a rough and tumble explanation of it.

null,null,koptimism,lfc99,,null,"**Ibe**: Can we take a second to admire how fucking amazing it is that teams are *already* double-marking him? The lad's still a teenager, he's not even had a full season of PL football, and at one point Stoke had four players converging on him when he had the ball. Massive threat.

As OP says, one aspect is for Ibe to learn how to overcome the added attention - but in the short term, I'd like to see Ibe learn how to punish teams for double-marking him by moving the ball on quickly, so that his teammates can exploit the space left by the opposing players drawn to Ibe.

**Possession:** I'm not too concerned about our inability to ""rest on the ball"" away from home.  Teams now know to try and press Liverpool, and will be more willing to do that at home when there's more of an expectation for them to win. We'll see our players getting more time on the ball at Anfield.

Having said that, it's really clear the midfield haven't had much time to work with Benteke as the front man. When you've got a big man up front, then hitting it long to him can become an easy way out, when really it should be weighed up just like any other passing option based on the potential for an attack to develop afterwards. (We had a similar problem with Carroll under Dalglish). Both Henderson and Lallana (and probably others, I just recall those two) had moments where they hit it long to Benteke despite him being isolated and unable to do anything even if he had won the duel. On the other hand, Coutinho had some good moments with Benteke, which is promising.

**Rodgers' tactics:** I agree with OP that this is the style of play we'll be using with tricky away games. The increased financial power in the PL makes the mid-table teams more likely to cause upsets than ever before - just see what West Ham did to Arsenal. Stoke, along with Swansea, Southampton, West Ham, Newcastle (who will be fine under McClaren), West Brom, Palace and Everton are the teams I anticipate to make up the mid-table spots, and while we should always aim to beat these teams (not set up for the draw), a draw away from home isn't a bad result against these sides either.",null,0,null,1439208372,null,null,1439208702,0,ctxv3e3,null,t3_3ggc7g,null,null,null,t3_3ggc7g,null,null,null,1440391204,null,11,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

You're absolutely spot-on in that he needs to move the ball quickly into the space vacated by the players tripling up on him, and if he learns to do that we will have a lot of success going forward. I think another way for him to be effective would be to start making more runs off the shoulder and behind the defence, we have players who will pick him out well and he is rapid. Also if him and Clyne learn to combine well we have the option of sending in crosses from the byline to Benteke

**Possession**: You're right in that Benteke gives our players a lazy option, but I hope they learn how to effectively hit him with a long ball: that tactic is excellent for bypassing the press if we can get someone like Ibe or Markovic running off him for a flick-on. You're right in that it's not the most concerning thing, but if we had a keeper with quality distribution it would be very difficult to press us: an issue for next season I think though

**edit:**

I agree with you on aiming to beat these teams: I think away from home against those teams we should take our cue from Chelsea in that the first priority is not to concede and then the second priority is to win.

Not sure that this is really that punitive. Interest rates are as low as is possible. So low that we are having to resort to QE and other systems across the west to counteract. Some bonds in Europe are currently on negative interest so governments are being paid for their debt. 

So the question is, what would happen to the economy if the govt was in surplusin 2008 and what effect would that have had when the banking crisis hit.

Well, a public sector surplus means that, with a trade deficit, the private sector would have to go into deficit. It's a zero sum game across the three sectoral balances. 

So when the banking collapse hits, the economy is exactly the same in total but in different places. This time there is a small pile of govt cash to spend (dwarfed by the scale of the bailouts) and the private sector is in a worse off position than it would have been as the recession hits.

It is always cheaper for the pubic sector to borrow than the private sector so the imbalances are generally managed to leave it this way. ",null,0,null,1439208909,null,null,false,0,ctxv9mx,null,t3_3gcokv,null,null,null,t1_ctwyou7,null,null,null,1440391285,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Worse they refused to take liability. The fact is thousands if not close to a million people have been affected by the tragedy. The complete unwillingness (The Indian Government has made pay outs) of Union Carbide and their current owners DOW to pay out what at the time was a miniscule demand (Like 10 Million Dollars. No seriously. They didn't ask a lot of money) jut tars them as the sort of people who literally didn't care about the bottom line. 

The major flaw was the lack of government oversight, basic safety standards and the like. Basically? In order for businesses to invest in things like fire safety and hard hats you have to make it a law. The Indian government didn't. However the liability was still solely on the people who basically built no redundancies into their chemical storage (like say? Multiple tanks so that any spill would be more contained). 

Money from the Indian government has reached the people. It can reach the people. Despite what people think no one would touch the Union Carbide payout because it is so polarised.

* Battery was very weak; could start the bike once or twice between an alternator charge, but after the second start attempt it would very rapidly die off. Could be easily tested by starting the bike and turning it off several times - if the starter motor starts to struggle then the battery is on its way out (or not charged correctly).
* Rear brake disc is scored; likely because I had the pads on for too long, but I was told the pads were brand new when I got it. This could easily have been checked if I knew how to look at the caliper like I do now, but at the time of purchase I had not ever got to grips with brake calipers or pads and was pretty green to maintenance. 
* Oil was in there far too long. Again, was told that the fluids and filter was new when I got the bike but on my first oil/filter change, it looked much much worse than I expected. You may not realize it until you drain the oil out and see flakes of material in it. I guess this is hard to test for.
* Clutch is on its way out, I'm pretty sure; gear changes aren't as smooth as they should be, but then without having had much experience on a big bike I didn't know how easy it should have been.

All in all it's actually not that bad.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11753342/British-abortion-clinic-forced-to-close-by-pro-life-protestors.html

&gt;Abortion providers have claimed that a clinic is due to shut down in the UK because of 'intimidating protesters'.
The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) confirmed that a British clinic that offers abortion services to women has been forced to close “as a direct result of protest activity” – but refused to name the clinic or its owners.

&gt;Anti-abortion protesters have been criticised by women’s groups in the past for ‘aggressive’ tactics, such as filming women entering for their appointments and displaying graphic images of foetuses.
Clare Murphy of BPAS said: “It’s generally a problem whether we have clinic closures or not. There’s no doubt a small number of people, who are against abortion, are able to have a serious knock-on effect on women’s services.
“We know the police feel relatively powerless to do anything about this, as there’s nothing in law that means they can move them away.

null,null,JamDunc,eng-yorkshire,ex-Yorkshire now Sverige,null,"Well, I'm currently stood in the security queue at Copenhagen airport getting ready to fly to Naples (via France) for my next job which is in the Adriatic Sea. But how did I get here.

I did A-levels in Accounts, Economics and Law. Got a B, a D and a N respectively (had to do criminal law in my 2nd year, I was the only one who wanted to do civil, so basically gave up on law). 

Got a place at Stirling University to do a dual honours in Accounting with French. But decided to defer, take a gap year and work to save some money. So I went sort of full time at my part time job with Next (great fun). During said year, met many people with degrees who were having to get a job at Next and decided that maybe Uni wasn't the best idea.

So I joined the RAF and gave up my spot at Uni. Did my apprenticeship there and became an aircraft technician in avionics. Got posted to Lossiemouth in Scotland, where I met one of my now best friends and he got me more into PC gaming. During this time I played World of Warcraft at launch (more on this later).

After 4 years at Lossiemouth, saw colleagues leaving to work offshore (Aberdeen being down the road). Thought it seemed like a good idea so I put in my notice to leave and applied for a job offshore. But didn't get it and during my resettlement, I got my sparky qualifications. So I had to move back to my parents in Barnsley and look for work.

I applied and didn't get any jobs but through an agency, ended up as an engineering administrator at a gravy factory and whilst there got a phone call from both an electricians and an offshore company. 

Got offered both but the offshore job didn't start for 3 months so I went and became an electrician.

After the 3 months I started my new career in ROV's and that's what I'm still doing 7½ years later.

Now during my time as an ROV pilot I decided to travel on my 30th birthday, went to Sweden and met up with an old guildmate from WoW, the next year we started dating and after 3½ years together, I'm now living in Sweden (got my permanent residency last week), looking at doing a network systems course (the oil and gas industry is weak atm) over here and am fairly fluent in Swedish.

I think we have done quite good business this period. Cleverley is an amazing signing on a free and Geri could have cost a lot more as well. We did business worth way more than we spent and got in cover for the players who regularly get injured. I think that's great stuff.  
  
Additionally, three positions were addressed. Three people will be coming in. Maybe also Lennon as a fourth if we get him on the cheap. Patience.  
  
And you are obviously right that not everything needs to be spun positively but do you really want to say that our recruitment has been bad? Given the circumstance that our team itself did not need all too much addressing in the first place but a bit more cover and some patching up here and there, and you can easily see a pattern here. Our squad is still very good, has a lot of potential and young players we want to bring forward a bit more like Barkley, Stones, Galloway and also McAleney has impressed me in the pre season. We have a strong academy and very good youth players. In the last two seasons, we produced Barkley and Stones. This year it's maybe Galloway's time to shine. Guess what - both Barkley and Stones could easily find a new home at at Top-5 side for 30M+.

Benteke has enough about him to make it work I think.

People forget that while Sturridge was rapid he usually conserved his energy when out of possession and very often walked around when the opposition had the ball. Firmino seems like the same type of workaholic pressing machine that Suarez was so I'm optimistic about our capacity to press with this team. Milner and Henderson will be a vital component of it and I can see us bullying teams when we press them.

Also when you look at teams that press well, the striker has not always been hyper-mobile: Klopp's Dortmund who made their team on pressing for example had Lewa up front who I would regard as being roughly the same in terms of mobility as Benteke.

Ultimately our pressing will succeed if we are clever, aggressive and tenacious, a front 5 of Milner, Henderson, Firmino, Coutinho, and Benteke have enough mobility and power between them if they work as a good unit.

**edit:**

To explain what I mean by intelligent, when you press in packs you are not all trying to engage the man on the ball. You want 1 or preferably 2 players to engage the man on the ball and the rest to cut out passing angles to his team-mates. If Benteke has the awareness and intelligence to do the second part which requires less mobility then there are still 4 other players in our press who all have the mobility to do the first part. This is why Lambert, someone considerably less mobile than Benteke was able to be part of Pochettino's pressing game at Southampton.",null,0,null,1439209698,null,null,1439210144,0,ctxvjmq,null,t3_3ggc7g,null,null,null,t1_ctxvcar,null,null,null,1440391416,null,8,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8,null

I don't understand your logic. Saying Gil and Grealish could do what Lennon does isn't relevant if they won't be selected to play in that position, which is what Sherwood has already stated. I actually think Grealish would be more suited to playing out wide, but it makes no difference. He won't play there unless Sherwood changes his mind. 

I don't know if Ayew can play that role- from what I know, he's played down the middle, but I will take your word for since you seem to know. How often did he play there for Lorient, and was he any good?

Again, Robinson isn't a valid choice either since he's out on loan. 

Of what we have left to fill those positions, Lennon would be a no brainier. I don't want to see Gabby, Bacuna or Nzogbia playing in that position. Lennon is a better player than any of those three.

null,null,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; He is 19, withdrawing from us slightly and certainly being rebellious.

If I'm perfectly honest, that answers your question.

Have you considered that maybe the reason he comes across as a bit rebellious and distant from you is because you aren't treating him like an adult? You say ""he does things which I hugely disapprove of, doesn't always make the best decisions"" - as if that justifies potentially ""banning"" him from being allowed to make his own decisions. Yet you are obviously much older and mature than him, and you're here asking what decision YOU should make - which shows even you don't know the best decisions at all times. 

No adult is perfect, and from time to time we make mistakes. But the ability to make our own mistakes is what makes us independent, and what grows us as an individual.

Yes, you should look out for his safety.  But you do that by talking to him like an equal adult. Don't go in saying ""I don't want you to go to this"". Just try to understand what this gathering is about and the main motivations for why he wants to go. State why you are concerned, but at no point suggest that you want to forbid him from going - because you can't. Threatening to take away his individual agency as an adult will only make the relationship between you and your son worse.

tl;dr It's right to be a concerned parent, but ultimately all you can do as a parent is make him realise you are concerned.",null,0,null,1439210423,null,null,1439210637,0,ctxvsuk,null,t3_3gg6o2,null,null,null,t1_ctxtpjq,null,null,null,1440391536,null,6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null
null,null,RobbieFowler9,null,null,null,"But Rodgers doesn't have a clear direction. Look at the players he has bought and the way we have played over the years. At first we're a possession based side, then we're a high pressure, attacking side, last season who knows what style we were playing and yesterday against Stoke we were hitting long balls to Benteke all day. Each season we've had a completely different style of play. 

Yeah the second string squad played well, but lets not pretend that Rodgers put them out because he thought they could win. He put them out because he'd thrown in the towel before a ball had been kicked, he'd decided that Real Madrid were far too superior to us so lets not even try and beat them. We waited 5 years to get back into the Champions League and didn't even try when we got there. 

And my point isn't that I think Lucas is a brilliant player we can't afford to lose. It's that he's the type of person I like having at this club, and Rodgers isn't.

I think you just need to learn a little about how we as humans perceive risk. I highly recommend this [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Risk-The-Science-Politics-Fear/dp/0753515539). The thing is that these events over the last 7 years (my time here) are vary rare given the number of people using the Downs throughout the day/night/year. The problem with these events is that they have all come in a relatively short period of time and we thus think that The Downs have always been dangerous, which they haven't. As humans we are terrible at long term risk management, but better at short term. So the logical way to look at the situation is to look at the last 10 years of these crimes on the Downs, look at the number of people using them and when, and then we will have some idea of how dangerous the area really is. The issue with your assessment is that it's based on a relatively high number of crimes within a short period of time. So in your mind the Downs is very risky, which it isn't. But this way of thinking does require to treat the situation very objectively. 

This obliviously goes without saying that the individual needs to be found and I am sure that the police are doing their best to make that happen. As for the Downs being 'dodgy' at night, I have never had an issue and regularly walk/cycle/run there. And none of my friends have had issues either.

What matters is how the team is set up not only to reduce the number of mistakes - but (more importantly) how they're set up to correct individual mistakes that happen.

When Bentaleb made that mistake, our defense was poorly set up - and as a result, Walker had to make that full-speed attempt at getting the ball from Rooney at the last minute. 

Hopefully, the team will look at not only why Bentaleb made that stupid mistake, but how we should've been better set up to react better once that kind of mistakes happen.

For reference, to be paying £3k pcm you'd need to be earning well over £150,000 gross.

I know you may not want to go down the legal route, but maintenance and access arrangements are completely separate. If she kicks up a fuss and stops you seeing your daughter you may have to go to court. If you are overpaying maintenance by just £500 per month to keep her sweet, that could cost you the best part of a hundred grand between now and your daughter turning 16.

We didn't create anything really, apart from the chance Henderson wasted. Stoke looked the more likely to score for most of the match and I definitely wouldn't say we were anywhere near to controlling the game until Can came on. 

We defended well, but we've made so many mistakes defensively in the last few seasons that I don't think we can count on that week in, week out, which means we need to create more chances. 

My biggest concern is that with Benteke on the pitch we kept looking for the long ball or a hopeful cross into the box rather than working for a chance or opening. Benteke did well to win most of them, but it never created a chance for us.

On an individual basis:

Clyne and Lovren did well at the back, and Gomez was good considering he's 18 and making his PL debut. 

Hendo and Milner were getting in each others way until Can came on and they had a bit more freedom to attack.

Coutinho was wasteful with possession all game, but then he hit that shot out of nowhere. 

Ibe did okay but was tough because they were doubling up on him. 

Lallana was poor, he's too slow on the ball, he dwells on it and never plays a quick pass. 

Benteke did well with what he was given, long balls from the back, but he didn't look very mobile at times and wasn't pressing the defence at all in the last 5 minutes.

Firmino and Can both looked great when coming on, I hope they get starting spots soon.

Oh for frig's sake am I sick of this straw-manning of Corbyn supporters.  Oddly enough, we're not all success-hating sadomasochists that think that just because Labour did some truly shonky things under Blair we should somehow turn Labour into an election-losing machine.

Maybe it's more simple than that—that we don't agree that Jeremy is _a priori_ unelectable (yes, conventional wisdom and a few polls here and there show he has a rough ride ahead of him, but there's a gulf of difference between the evidence and the conclusion even when we don't pull in things like the polls suggesting many of Corbyn's positions are, shock horror, popular!), and that we think that Jeremy is legitimately what the party needs to shake it up a bit, take it out of its comfort zone, start offering a clear and positive message, and bring politics back to a clear conviction-led choice rather than the lesser-of-N-evils over-rehearsed and over-glossy situation that people are clearly sick of being given every 5 years.

Bureaucracies always tend to favour the status quo - the employees don't want to do it more efficiently because they're not used to doing it differently, or the change may threaten their jobs; their managers, in turn, oppose it and claim ""it can't be done"" because that would make their jobs harder or threaten their departmental reach. When run by a civil service inertia is more likely to win because, ultimately, it's someone else's money. 

It's not just state-run organisations that suffer this - Microsoft has been notably mastodonic in fields lacking competition, and the management and interdepartmental problems there are [legendary.](http://i.imgur.com/DRs49kZ.jpg)

The objection to the current railway structure is that public money is being spent on the infrastructure, and private companies are making a profit, but we'd be spending money on the infrastructure, anyway. If Virgin Trains discovers a way to save money, then they have an incentive to undercut Great Western and steal their business.

I haven't travelled by train much recently, but I'm not inclined to meddle much with something that seems largely to be working - under BR the railways were truly awful.

In the ideal world the private companies that make a profit from the railway infrastructure would be owned by individual citizen shareholders - that way we'd benefit from competition and private sector efficiencies, but it wouldn't be a problem that these companies were making a profit (because the profits would be funding grannies' pensions).

A GOOD landlord should be getting these cleaned for a new tenant REGARDLESS of the state of the property. If the property was dirty and in poor state-of-repair, then the landlord is entitled to take a contribution for the cleaning/repair/replacement from the tenant's deposit.

This was a fixed-fee arrangement, so price shouldn't of gone higher.

Most of the non-online only companies I got quotes from, the estate agent gave us a recommendations, were around 1000 for fees with searches on-top.

Benteke's biggest issue was one of chemistry, in my opinion.  Players were trying to get him the ball in good spots but they just couldn't link up well.  There were multiple times where there was a good opportunity and the pass just didn't work out.  I would like to see how Ings does in this role.

Ibe looks like he has great skills and physical ability.  He just has to learn how to use those tools to create chances for himself and others.  

Lallana has been discussed a lot.

IMO, the optimal lineup seems to be with Can at center holding and with Firmino (would like to see more time for him before writing this in stone) and Coutinho as attacking midfielders feeding a striker with Henderson/Milner roaming the middle.",null,0,null,1439215017,null,null,false,0,ctxxs07,null,t3_3ggc7g,null,null,null,t3_3ggc7g,null,null,null,1440392534,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null
