I think some people just need to relax, it took 10-15 games for him to adapt to Swansea, and we are asking him to play in a 2 striker formation - which he has never done before. He can do it we just need to give him until September to adapt. It was obviously not a short term signing by Pellegrini, signing him during AFCON alone pretty much showed that. 

IMO a he could be the man who makes Pellegrini's 4-2-2-3 work in Europe. I'm sure everyone has heard pundits like Neville talk about how you can play 442 but only if one striker drops deep and defends in midfield - that's what Bony is brilliant at! He comes deep, he's physical with midfielders, great control and passing which makes him perfect to be that guy who drops deep and helps the midfielders.

null,false,butler1233,null,null,null,"There are many things which are different when Monopoly is run, logistically and otherwise, which if they aren't detrimental in any other way, they're just fucking confusing. 

Allow me to make a list of changes which apply in different parts of the restaurant (I work in a drive thru restaurant, so the parts about kiosks are assumptions)

**Kitchen** (I don't do kitchen much so I probably missed something)

* Before monopoly, the chicken legend had 2 separate boxes, one for the mayo legend and one for the salsa legend. Not any more. Its now a grey box and we have to press flaps on the side of the box so people on the counter know what they're picking up.
* Apple pies are suddenly a thing - In my restaurant, Apple pies aren't all that popular, except when monopoly is on. This means they need cooking more often. Apple pies are the longest cooking thing we have in the entire menu, taking just under 6 minutes to cook. Sometimes, this means the fryer used to cook the pies in is tied up, and in my restaurant we use the same fryer for the apple pies as the Mozzarella dippers, but only one can be cooked at a time.
* Items disappearing and reappearing on screen - In the kitchen we have screens which tell us items which are on order on the tills, even if they haven't been paid for yet. This means that when twats come along and don't mention until its time to pay that they have monopoly instant wins (which happens far too much), things get taken off order to then but put back on order then confusion ensues and people complain they haven't got their food yet because we thought it had already been done.
* The Big Tasty is back. Fuck that, it takes too long because the fact that the Tasty without isn't even a grill order is just annoying. Somebody orders a tasty. they shout ""Tasty on order"" or something to that effect. WITH OR WITHOUT BACON. We're not psychic.

**Front Counter**

* Breakfast Changeover - According to the promo rules, we aren't meant to be giving out cups with the stickers on during breakfast. This makes life hard because then we need to find cups which don't already have stickers (As cold cups come pre-stickered) if somebody orders a cold drink, for example. 
* Instant win stickers - Fuck off, these are just plain annoying. Especially when customers think we're psychic and know they have them. Refer to the 3rd part of the kitchen problems for reasons why this is a problem. However, the stickers allow most staff members to, at their discretion, interpret the instant win stickers as any other instant win sticker, or anything else really. It depends where you are, but the rules say its up to the server. 
* Customers dumping their non-winning stickers on the counter - It's annoying, don't do it.
* Non-pre-stickered drinks - Some drink cups/bottles don't come pre-stickered, and as a result we have to add stickers to them ourselves. This only applies to items which have been bought as meals. For example, if somebody bought a meal with a hot drink or a bottle of water, a sticker would be applied to it, but if they bought it separately, the sticker is not provided. This can make customers annoyed because the cold drinks and iced drinks have stickers by default. 
* Customers wanting more stickers / Bitching they didn't get any on their non-meal drinks - See above for the reason behind this. People moan because some people will be seen with stickers on their usually sticker-less drinks, or will demand stickers on anything and everything else. Today I had a man complain because he didn't get stickers on his happy meal. It's worth mentioning that every promo poster says ""16 OR OVER"" in the corner, so obviously happy meals do not have it. Again, be nice to your server, you might just get some stickers. 
* It's busier - For kiosk restaurants, people HAVE to come to the till because the kiosks don't take instant wins. Yay. That's in addition to the fact its already busier than usual anyway.

**Kiosks** (We don't have these at mine)

* You can't use instant wins on the kiosk. 

**Dining Area**

* Don't stick your useless stickers to tables/chairs/whatever. It happens too much and they're a huge pain to pick off sometimes. 

**Drive thru**

* The scenario /u/Thauma posted happens all the time. Stop doing it. Seriously.
* Needing to manually apply stickers slows everything down.
* Orders changing on the screen because of ""twats with vouchers"" slows everything down and confuses the runners. 
* Handing out game boards with receipts/straws/napkins slows everything down. 

**Employees**

* We're not allowed to play - This means we're *meant* to hunt down sticker-free cups/fries/whatever for our break, but really we can't be arsed, we like collecting game pieces as much as customers do. But we can cheat, so it's much more fun.

I used to dislike Townsend. I constantly argued against his defenders during the summer months, feeling that selling him for £15 m was an obvious move for a 23 year old who scored one good goal for England.

He won me over, and the chelsea match was the turning point for me, but more on that later. Looking back, his 'off the ball' contributions have been substantial. He's been supportive of team-mates such as Danny Rose and Roberto Soldado in key moments. The former he pulled away during the racial abuse fiasco in an England match, the latter he constantly supports on pitch, I watched Andros constantly try to remotivate Roberto after that 4-2 Burnley miss in January.

On the ball, he's got better, with six goals and assists a piece he's dramatically improved on his stats compared to last year. Also, contrary to the copy and paste opinion which I've been seeing a lot on here regarding his decision making, it's definitely better and he shoots a LOT less than he used to, and the times where he does shoot are times where I've been glad that he did, particularly in instances where beforehand passes he has made have led to nothing due to the failures of other players.

Incompetents will howl that many of his goals have been penalties, but they have been important ones. His penalty which extended our lead over chelsea to two on New Year's Day was fucking crucial, and personally goes down as the bravest moment I have ever witnessed a Spurs player stepping up to.

He's still one of our most dangerous wingers, he's one of our few players that can beat a man and his pace speaks for itself. I am generally more comfortable with him on the pitch as opposed to Lamela, his goal against Swansea highlights a potential far greater than anything seen from Erik so far.

I want the two to remain at Tottenham. I think we should sell Lennon and buy Depay or someone.

Just because High Anglicanism may have more similar appearance to Catholicism of the 15th century does not mean it is valid or Catholic. There are traditional Latin masses that occur today in the Catholic Church. All the masses as stated by the Vatican are valid.

If this is at the cost of massive human rights abuses, it is better than them dying along with their families and their allies.

They aren't going to change their mind or approach just because we ask them nicely because that would lead to them being overthrown. If we say its a choice between being fluffy and liberal and buying our weapons or buying the same basic thing from the Chinese or the Swedes, they are going to go for the latter. The result is not any net positive for the country or humanity, it's just that the benefits of the arms trade go to China or Sweden instead.

The result? People here lose their jobs, we lose economic output, our balance of trade is harmed, and we end up having to place a load more orders to maintain our defence industrial base.

I am not being apathetic. I am explicitly saying we should sell weapons to anyone who wants to buy them, that there is no comparative harm that comes from it as long as an international market for arms exists while there are significant benefits for us.

Other than making a few people campaigning against the arms trade feel better, what does no longer exporting arms actually accomplish?

Grass is always greener though, I suppose. 

And that is the truth of the matter I think.

Is it stupid? Not at all. But moving here is almost certainly not going to be what you think it is. Not to suggest it would be bad, or you wouldn't get along with it at all, you might end up living here and loving it. 
But moving somewhere you've never been is incredibly risky, if you're serious about wanting to live here I really suggest you visit some parts of the country that you could realistically live in, avoid doing touristy things and try and see what normal day to day life is like!

It is hard to get residency here, probably just as hard as it is for British people to get residency in Canada funnily enough.

Like I said, the grass is always greener. But if it's what you really want, then it's always worth giving it a try.

Incorrect.

&gt;Besides the utter foolishness of gambling with the weather that could destroy the house at any time and she'd lose everything without insurance to cover the cost, what if a brick blows off the roof and hits a pedestrian? 

We functioned well before the days of insuring everything.

If a brick from her house hits a pedestrian, then pay up. Shit happens and this is why she is supposed to have an emergency fund.

&gt;She would be liable for millions in compensation. But she insists that it isn't a legal requirement and that nothing bad will come of not having it. 

This isn't America where people can claim millions in compensation. In England &amp; Wales, an injured pedestrian is only able to claim the costs incurred because of injury, and then some as sorry gesture. They might be able to claim for lawyer costs. It's likely that any claims caused by incidents similar to what you mentioned will only cost 4 figure number.

The average home insurance cost is £150 per year. This would take between 10-50 years for her to recoup the cost. Sounds bad? Not really, you have to consider the fact that the chances of this happening is close to nil.

Do you know why home insurance exist? It's because it would cost insurers paying out the claims less than what they would earn from insuring customers. With this assumption, the statistics state that she is more likely to save money by not insuring in a long run.

Southampton: I predict a score draw of some sort, I don't think we can beat them right now, but it's possible, depending on how well rested everyone is after the break. Persoanlly, I'm hoping Rom will have to miss out on Belgium's fixtures, and if whatever's keeping Mirallas out of the squad isn't too seirous, he should be back as well. 35 points.

Swansea away: I think we can sneak a win in this one, but I'll go with a draw. We've traditionally played well against the Swans, and they've not been consistent this season. 36 points.

Burnley: We're going to win this. I'd personally prefer to see Burnley stay up, I like Sean Dyche, I like the side, but at home we'll have the edge. We need to be wary of them, particularly Boyd and Ings, but we have the quality to see them off. 39 points.

United: Writing this one off. I just don't see us pulling something out of the bag to beat them. 39 points.

Villa (A): Another one we should win. Again, I like Villa, and they seem to be on a bit of a resurgence, but a draw or a win is on the cards here, as long as Jags and Stones can keep a good eye on Benteke. 40 Points. Salvation achieved, three games to go.

Sunderland: Even Advocaat can't save that club. Most likely, going into this game, they'll be coming off the back of four straight losses, and staring very much up from the cellar. Yes, they'll fight. Yes, they'll play hard. But that team can't score, and it can't defend. Over 90 minutes, we'll have them. 43 points.

West Ham (A): With any luck, survival will be mathematically assured at this point. Run out some youngsters, have a good runabout, give some experience. Likely a loss, but the Hammers haven't been doing great since December, and something could come from it. 43 points.

Spurs: Keep Kane Kontained. That has to be the mantra. Beyond that, I don't really care. More youngsters, please, see what happens. 43 points.

Which is not the case in Turkey. They have massive problems with rights for minorities. They were literally fighting a war for the last thirty years with their Kurdish population. Because the Turks wouldn't recognise them they wanted their own independence first. Now that that conflict has dragged on long enough they are trying new methods of achieving their freedom.

The problem we have is Lamela isn't really a winger. He was great there for Roma in spells, but he just isn't direct enough. It makes me laugh to see people criticise Townsend for being one dimensional when we have Lamela who is even worse. A winger should be looking to cause their defender problems, Lamela doesn't. He opts to cut in 9/10 as he doesn't have the pace, and then ends up congesting the middle, where he isn't entirely effective in terms of final ball. I definitely think Lamela will improve, it's just he's not really suited to playing on a wing in such a fast paced league.

Anglicanism has abandoned them and gone off the rails. Just because some high church types might appear like Catholics of the 15th century doesn't make them so. Not to mention the Porvoo Agreement which means Anglicans are in communion with Lutherans. Anglicanism is Protestantism, not Catholicism.

The Catholic Faith of today no matter how different it may look in appearance is the same teachings from the time of Richard III. His religion was not Anglican. Had he not died we very well may not have ever seen Anglicanism be created with all it's invented new teachings. It's very far from the Catholic faith these days. So no it can't make any claim that it is a successor to Catholicism. 

Edit: Here's an article discussing the investigation into the validity of Anglican orders and why they are invalid.

&gt;[40] Ms Levitt said in her witness statement that if at the stage of the desk study there had
been a clear case for re-interment elsewhere than Leicester, “we would have considered it, but it is unlikely that
we could have justified permitting the excavation”. Mr Buckley also emphasised in his witness statement that it was
unlikely that the University, as the major funder of the excavations, would have agreed to make such a considerable investment unless re-interment was to take place in the City. Neither would ULAS have been willing to spend money on exhumation if
there had been a real prospect that re-interment would sever the link between Leicester and Richard III. 

Under the terms of the licence the University had to actually dig in the car park, they decided where to bury the remains (Leicester of course)

But right, starting from Swansea, started great with Chadli scoring a lovely goal. Failed to build on our strong start and conceded an equaliser to Ki following our failure to clear a free kick which had hit the post. Then proceded to start the second half as well as we started the first with two quickfire goals from Mason and Townsend, Andros' effort particularly eye catching. At this point it appeared we may run away with it, but what will become a recurring theme here. We let Swansea back into the game late on with Sigurdsson hammering home from short range after Moreno's direct run and cross to the back post. However we held on for all three points

The following saturday we played our game in hand to catch up with the rest of the pack. Facing a resurgent QPR side under new coach and former Tottenham Hotspur employee Chris Ramsey. We started slowly with QPR's danger man Austin hitting the bar from just inside the box. We steadied the ship before the end of the second half with Harry Kane getting on the end of Andros' free kick from deep to give us the advantage late on in the half. We pushed on in the second half with Eriksen seeing a shot cleared off the line as well as hitting the post from range. Then Kane once more provided the goal after Mason's good ball over the top. Ranger's pulled one back from former spurs favourite Sandro. Once more however we held on for all three.

Fast forward 1 week to Sunday where we faced a Man Utd team low on confidence at Old Trafford in a massive game in the race for the top four. However they appeared nowhere near short of confidence as a half hour blitz saw the game out of reach for us. Little of note on our end.

Now to Saturday's game. We started like a house on fire with the main man Kane bagging an early double, putting us in the driver's seat against a struggling Leicester City. We seemed set to take out last week's frustration on the leagues bottom side with Eriksen striking the post and Chadli blazing the rebound over. But once more we failed to capitalise on our dominance with Leicester getting one back after some slack defending, giving them hope before half time. Leicester started the second half like they ended it with another goal, this time poor defending cost us at a set piece. But fear not as following a foul by David Nugent in the box on Danny Rose a penalty was given. Kane stepped up to bury his penalty to give us the lead. Eriksen had looked to wrap up the points when his shot was parried by Schmeichel into the path of the onrushing Schlupp to force it in for an unfortunate own goal. But comfortable endings are far from our forte as we allowed Leicester to gain a sliver of hope as following a long ball down the middle Nugent was able to semi redeem himself by pulling one back. But alas once more we held on for all three.

I'd make a start by doing some research on www.gov.uk and figuring out which visa is most likely for you to achieve. Check out the job shortage list, as well (really, just google ""UK job shortage list""). A lot of people from outside of the EU simply cannot emigrate to the UK based on their current careers and skill sets. It's pessimistic, but that's the reality of immigration right now.

1. Sunflower oil and eco-friendly green tea extracts from pure Jeju island protect the skin from harmful UV rays. 

2. Fermented yeast ingredients protects skin from ozone and other harmful materials. 

3. Mild care with 100% mineral filter protects sensitive skin

**About you:** Han Chinese; combination skin: oily t-zone, rest normal; tan fairly easily, rarely burnt.

**Your opinion:** The cream is a slightly pinkish colour. I want to say that it's from the ""sebum-control porous powder"" that's advertised. It doesn't leave any white cast. It glides on very easily when applying, and dries quickly and matte. This wouldn't make a good base for make up; I've attempted to apply BB cream on top but it wouldn't blend in very well.

I do like how it feels on my skin but as it's only SPF35, I only use it when I'm not spending a lot of time outside in the sun. I probably wouldn't repurchase this but there is a sun milk in the same line that is SPF50.

You're right in that you shouldn't have to be bombarded, but really don't take people giving a little heads up the wrong way. 

Honestly, don't worry about it if you get something physical wrong. Nobody cares really too much about the differences between the UK and Great Britain, let's say. It's mostly political and cultural stuff. You might slightly annoy a Scotsman by calling calling the UK England or something like that (not that you did that, that's just an example!), but people are forgiving and rational (usually) about that. They know you won't know everything. The Ireland thing can be a Touchier subject, depending on where you are and who you speak to. all the violence of the Troubles was not too long ago. But you should be OK, like I said, you will probably be easily forgiven.

He's not a predictable scorer, but knows where to be and how to finish.  He doesn't just rely on physicality (pace, dribbling, strength, ridiculous long shots), which is good because those things can dip with age.

But it's about how the club manages him.  Who are we gonna get in next season to support him?  He can't start every game, and Adebayor and Soldado are as good as useless at this point.  We need two strikers in, one who preferably can play as a pacy wide forward, to give Harry a rest and some genuine competition to keep his fire lit.

Plus, we need to recruit someone to supply his goals.  Eriksen has not been spectacular for reasonable chunks of this campaign, and Lamela, Chadli and Townsend are not providing regular assists for Kane either.  So having a great striker in form is useless unless someone's loading his gun.  We need most likely another CAM to take the load off Eriksen.

Finally, what are we gonna do about our backline?  Our defensive midfield plan is not working (need an upgrade on Mason really), and we're giving up goals far too easily.  Learn how to shut up shop better, and then teams can't just sit back all the time and soak up our meaningless possession.  They have to push harder against us, which then creates space for Kane et al. to exploit.

Pochettino has kind of had a golden nugget fall into his lap with Kane this season, and although his fitness program is obviously working wonders for him, I think Kane has often succeeded *despite* Poch's management of him and team, rather than because of.

Your wiki link has heat maps of the proper distruibution of ethnic groups and it shows there is a good spread. Those are the families mixing with neighbours and integrating. That's not to say that there aren't the clumps that you mention. But it's not as if every ethnic group territorialise regions of London exclusively.

1st generation immigrants have the option to live near others sharing the same experience as them, and why not, if it makes you feel more comfortable. Learning a language takes time, especially for adults. If you don't really have to, you don't really need to.

The 2nd generation will be the ones that speak fluent English, grow up with angloshere TV, film, foods, socialisation, etc. Integrated, if you like. This is the pattern through history for places where immigration happens.

As for you last point, I think your view is the wrong way around. Extremists don't come here, they're created here. All it takes are a few voices to tell you that you're not welcome in your home, and the reaction is to entrench within who you feel comfortable with. 

With Islam, there is a the option to go and fight for extremist groups in the middle east.

True.

&gt;Your line of logic would mean it is bigoted to dislike criminals which is a nonsense.

Also true to an extent. If you disliked all criminals with the same passion, fervour or conviction then it would be. If you held the same opinion of a murderer and a petty thief based on the mere fact that they were both 'criminals'.

&gt;I do not have to tolerate racism from the far right.

Correct, tolerating intolerance is not a requirement of a tolerant society.

&gt;I will not associate or help anyone from the far right.

That is your bigoted prerogative. You dismiss all other factors and any rationality in your decision in favour of dislike. And why?...

&gt;If they don't want to be hated they shouldn't believe despicable things such as promoting racism.

The children's accusations can be found on youtube and are detailed enough to include information about tatoos and marks on the private parts of the accused pedophiles. The children have been examined by a doctor and the medical results are online which confirms the children have been abused.

If you're into more alternative stuff then [The Oasis](http://www.theoasisfashionstore.co.uk/) is a quite nice indoor market tucked away on Corporation Street.

Also on Corporation Street is [The Square Peg,](http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/the-square-peg) part of the Wetherspoon chain, quite nice British food. Another nice chain pub I'd recommend is [Gosta Green](http://www.screampubs.co.uk/thegostagreenbirmingham) by Aston University, fairly similar to The Square Peg, but a bit more modern.

If you're looking for an old-style pub then [The Post Office Vaults](http://www.postofficevaults.co.uk/) has a great selection, also worth mentioning is The Woodman Pub ([they don't have a website](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=the+woodman+birmingham&amp;oq=the+woodman+birmingham&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2j69i64l3.2407j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8) but if you just aim to make your way to Millennium Point (Birmingham City University building) it's right opposite)

[The Library of Birmingham](http://www.libraryofbirmingham.com/) is a fantastic new building, with what seems like a million books and lovely views of the city from the balconies.

Other than that, Birmingham has most things you'd expect from a large city centre (An Odeon, loads of places to eat and shop all near the train station). Sorry the majority of these are pubs, I've probably outed myself as a student.

6) Isn't that exactly what Listen was?

8) This wasn't Moffat's fault at all. Series 8's reduced length had something to do with the extended length of Series 7 and its specials and the way the BBC sells the show in multiseason packages internationally. Series 9 will have a normal run this year.

GK: Not completely sure, but Neto, Romero, Ochoa, Ryan (Australian gk, but I think we decided against it) 

Defenders: If Manquillo leaves we will be looking at another RB, Johnson is on the way out. Flanagan will be offered another contract. Those dreaming of Dani Alves, he's probably on the way to PSG so it's not going to happen (Also his wages are high as crap) 

Midfielders: We do have interest in Pjanic and Khedira but the former's club is asking for a massive fee and the latter has massive wages and is injuries prone. Lucas Vazquez and Milner remain retain interest. 

Forwards: Vietto (I really want him) Ings, and recently we have looked at Firmino. 

If we retain CL football and raise funds through players leaving we MAY me able to go for the higher caliber of players, such as Carvalho, Pjanic. Lacazette, as as I would like it to, will probably not happen.

In the original EU tax harmonisation plans, no country was meant to have an 0% rate of tax on anything, but since Britain was one of the very few countries (I think Ireland and Malta are the others) which had a 0% rate, we were allowed to keep those items that were already there.

What we aren't allowed to do is to put anything into those 0% categories that wasn't there originally, meaning that our 5% 'reduced' rate of VAT is the minimum the Government can now set.

I don't know if it's true that razors are in the 0% category - it seems plausible that they were in the 0% bracket before Maastricht - but for whatever reason sanitary products weren't, and as such 5% is as low as they can go (I think the last Government reduced them from the full rate to the reduced rate).  I can't actually find anything suggesting that sanitary products are considered ""luxury"" beyond claims to that end by campaigns to abolish the tax, so I don't know where it's come from.

So yes, VAT as a whole is very inconsistent, and largely because of the weird and wonderful compromises that came about when tax rates were being harmonised across the continent.

The children even get so detailed as to describe tattoos and markings on the private areas of the alleged abusers. The specificity of the information provided by the children on YouTube is exactly what makes the claims so credible. Also the mother took the children to a doctor who confirmed the children were sexually and physically abused and subsequently those documents were uploaded online. 

However the father accused the mother of harassment and police followed that up with an attempt at a home arrest without a warrant on some other technicality. There is video of this police home visit online. It appears the mother and her friends in the house were extremely afraid of police corruption and lacked trust with the police and so did not want to open the front door. This fear arose since the children's testimony on YouTube also includes accusations against alleged corrupt child services some of whom are also accused of child abuse.   There is also video of the grandparents online who are here to take legal custody of the children however despite not being accused of anything are also now not able to take custody of the children.     

You can probably find almost all of the videos including testimony of sexual abuse directly from the children here:
https://www.youtube.com/user/allmoderncons/videos

ukColumn.org is also covering the story and previously interviewed the mother.

&gt;Because we were so fucking adored before, right?  

We have that bad reputation not because of one or two players, but because of all of our players (not all, but a lot). People aren't ""jealous of the success"" because the only thing we've won is a relatively insignificant cup. People think Chelsea play like cunts because we field so many of them and people like you have no idea that they're bad.  

Oscar, Matic, Cahill, Ivanovic, Terry, Mikel and Ramires are all assholes. There isn't a team I can think of with that many assholes.  

Oscar is a cunt because he CONSTANTLY is whining about ref calls. When people were persecuting Chelsea for surrounding the ref, Oscar is the kind of guy that will be the first one to scream at the ref. (nobody say 'Terry' because he's the captain). He's also a cunt for diving so often and using it as a crutch when he's unable to do anything on the ball, which is much more often than you think.  

I honestly don't understand why you're arguing that you would rather NOT have (statistically) the 4th-best player in Europe just because he doesn't track back.

As it stands now (this does not include the Manchester United game):

* 8-0-1 (W-D-L): If we do the incredible, we have a 100% chance of finishing in the Top 4.

* 5-2-2 gives us a 51% chance for a top four finish.
* 6-2-1 (representing a win over Man Utd) gives us a 93% chance.

The actual document is here

http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmquad/608/60802.htm

Going through it briefly

The UK has approved ""anti-riot shields, assault rifles shotguns, hand grenades, body armor, military helmets, submachine guns, military support vehicles, tear gas ammunition, etc, etc"", to Libya. Not surprising, the intl community, UN, NATO and Arab league heavily supported Libyan opposition during uprising. They support the current elected gov against the non-aligned militia's and growing IS threat

Exports of rifles and equipment approved to Saudi not surprising, considering long relationship and trade ties. Despite their medieval world views, the Saudi leadership are very pro-Western. Of course some of the wealthy financiers that live there, not so much..

""Military helmets and cryptographic software"" have been approved to Syria, not to Bashar Assad, IS or extremist brigades (such as Al Nusra). The US, France, UK (some other Euro nations) Turkey, and Arab league have been arming moderate Syrian opposition

The other countries of concern are ""Afghanistan, China, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Russia, and Sri Lanka""

**Afghanistan** - UK has been part of the NATO force there

**China** - everyone trades with China

**Iran** - wow interesting, according to the report its ""military electronic equipment"" - will be interesting to see their response on that

**Russia** - surprising again! components for military helicopters, electronics parts, crytography, etc, probably earlier last year before the crisis in Ukraine, although will be interesting to see how gov responds on that

**Iraq** - like Afghanistan, nothing surprising, many countries arming the Kurds against IS at the moment

**Israel** - nothing surprising, decades of arms exports. But like Saudi will be controversial among critics

**Sri Lanka** - used excessive force getting rid of the Tamil Tigers, were internationally condemned, don't have too much of a grasp on the current situation to comment

The main points of interest the article draws are the sales of components of military electronic tech to Iran (could be laptops, who knows) and the sales approved to Russia

Its hard to believe such criminal allegations could be resolved in the family court since it cannot have jurisdiction to investigate allegations of sexual crimes of child services officers. It is totally outside the court's jurisdiction and the attempt may indicate corruption in the court. It is unsurprising for mainstream papers to run stories coming straight out of a venue without checking for corruption like this but the details of the matter really require this case to be handled in a proper criminal court with a trial by jury.  If it turns out that the children's testimony turns out to be false regarding tattoos etc then declarations of innocence and justice can be swiftly achieved for those falsely accused. I think the authorities should return the children to the grandparents and get to work arresting the many accused so that preliminary investigations can commence.

Here is the video of the children's testimony.

Guide Dogs don't need gov money, they are loaded because of cute fluffy Labradors and a visible problem. Other blind services are funded by government and often delivered through charities. 

&gt; We don't fund hospitals based on which tv programme happens to raise most money

Nobody is suggested we should. Also, that isn't how Comic Relief works. The TV show is just to raise money, who gets it is decided by a tender committee, nothing to do with the public. 

&gt; It just doesn't seem right to me that some charities are immensely wealthy because of their profile

They are wealthy because people appreciate the work that they do. And what do you mean by wealthy anyway? They are professional businesses with assets but they're expenditure on staffing is very low compared to the private sector. 

&gt; associated plastic nose manufacturers, leaflet printers, 'chuggers' and TV companies all creaming off their share (""making a living off the misery of others"") while others have to struggle.

You mean like normal british manufacturing businesses? Or students who are often doing the chugging? They are legitimate sources of income. 

&gt;  the very existence of these organisations absolve the state from dealing with the fact that essential services should be paid for by everyone equally

That would be lovely, but the gov aren't paying. So you would rather people do nothing? Leave people to die alone and in squalor in protest?

* The main BBC header right at the top is now white, which sticks out too much, making it look as if that header is the most important section of BBC News. It's not - the news categories are.
* The news category are now all the same super bright red as the rest of the super bright red background. Although there's feint dividers separating each news category, they're not bright enough and make all the categories look as if they're one. Home | UK | World suddenly becomes Home UK World.
* Links have been recoloured black and bold instead of the original blue. The problem with that is that the subtitle of news stories is also black and bold, which is pretty confusing. Is black and bold a link or is it definition? The only way to tell is the feint underline. Links should be at-a-glance and contrast enough with other text styles that they can't be confused with each other.
* Useful dividers and light grey backgrounds have been removed. This causes content to merge into each other and why the site looks empty in parts. It's not that it's empty, it's just that it's one giant merged section instead of multiple smaller ones which has the effect of making it look empty.

**Solutions:**

* Add more contrast. If the super bright red is to stay, add either black to the palette or a maroon.
* Restyle the links so they're a different colour - possibly a maroon or the blue they were already using.
* Add clearer dividers and backgrounds to differentiate sections.

&gt;Mourinho was right about the bias in the media towards Chelsea. Two stamps in one game and all Carragher says:
Steven Gerrard red card down to 'frustration'

This isn't true  as another reddit already mentioned Carragher was asked to explain what makes a player as experienced as Gerrard do something that stupid. And he gave a decent explanation, along the way repeatedly saying it was incredibly stupid and deserved a red every day of the week.

More broadly there are 3 things you must consider

1) Gerrard was punished in the match changing the game, Costa wasn't part of the outrage, was that he seemed to have gotten away with it.


2) Gerrard is English, Costa isn't. English players from Sterlings slap in front of an official, Rooney's bad behavior, will always get preferential treatment from the media. See Souness rant on foreigners diving versus the principled English players. 

Or Gary Neville, who is great, but he gives English players a far nicer time, then foreigners, which I guess given he works with the England squad is unsurprising. 

3) Time constraints, from what I remember they had to go straight to the Hull Chelsea, game so couldn't devote their time exclusively to the coverage of the potential stamps. I think Skrtel's should definitely get more coverage though. Whether he bans or not is 50/50 as Costa was banned for the Can stamp not the one similar to Skrytel. 


In summary, are the media bias? Yes,  they're mostly pro English, pro Liverpool. Is this sufficient evidence for campaign not these specific examples. Gerrard has historically always got a free pass on the media, as would be expected for any English player,

Rami has been a great servant to the club (remembering a run through 5 City players at home a couple of years ago and of course his chip vs. Barca the year we got the CL) but he's just not up to scratch in Mourinho's side. His first touch in particular is something that has left me fuming consistently over the last couple of weeks- I'd expect Hazard and Willian would feel similarly when he's been the weak link in our build-up in the final third that would otherwise be sharp af.

Despite that, with Oscar's inconsistent form I appreciate Mourinho mixing up the line-up (somewhat), but I would advocate trying an AM with Willian as the 10, of course hazard on the left and slotting Cuadrado in on the right hand side. I don't think that moving Fabregas up and down playing in the 2 and then as the 10 has done anything to help his post-new year form. Although we're yet to see anything sublime from Cuadrado we haven't really seen him being given much more than substitute cameos and as Salah's loan move to Fiorentina has proven, these aren't really representative of a players true potential given some confidence from the manager. 

I also think that players like Loftus-Cheek should be getting more of an opportunity but by refusing to do this in the earlier parts of the season the pressure we're under to win every match now makes this more difficult. Considering this lack of rotation in the first two thirds of the season has also resulted in a drop in form that must be at least somewhat attributed to player fatigue (or possibly complacency?), some foresight from Mourinho in mixing up the squad would definitely have made a difference.

One took a long time to grow on me but eventually I saw that character development in him become more evident and I grew attached to him; Two was super weird and quirky, and then I got used to that pretty quickly and he was just generally fun, but still brought a very powerful presence to the character of the Doctor when needed.

Three, I just can't get my brain around his character.

Every single person I've spoken to about it they have been aggressively incredulous and flat out refusing to believe this is real, primarily because the word 'Satanic' shows up in a lot of the exposés containing the videos, since the claims involve the murder of children and the drinking of blood, which leads people into thinking this is some David Icke nonsense, rather than the fact that the type of people who are generally interested in these stories just happen to be David Icke types.

The systematised abuse of children by the establishment which is slowly being revealed through the Elm Guest House scandal, and the police corruption involved in the grooming scandals makes me realise just how easy it is for something like this to happen. 

Gabriel said that Mrs. Forsdyke (and plenty of others) has a huge tattoo of a demon all over her private parts. All an investigator would need to do to confirm this or not, is to examine her and the testimony would stand or fall. I hope to fuck these kids are safe.

The proton beam therapy hasn't been some miracle cure that has ridded Ashya of cancer - there wasn't any that we could see since the operation. That there is yet to be a local recurrence is reassuring, but it is still really too early to say for certain.

To give a quick summary of how this cancer treatment works, it essential consists of two things. You initially go in and try to cut out the cancer, then you give a regime of chemo-radiotherapy or proton beam therapy to try to kill off all the microscopic little remnants of cancer that you couldn't possibly cut out. What they are saying in this article is on a scan they couldn't see any cancer. That has been true ever since the operation. The problem is the tiny parts of the cancer can start growing into a new cancer years later - the normal rule of thumb is you can't say they are cancer free until there hasn't been any recurrence 5 years later. Some cancers such as breast cancer it is felt you have to wait 10 years before declaring the all clear. 

We won't truly know if this proton beam therapy has been effective for years yet. The odds are good he will be free of cancer, but we can't say that yet. The thing is even years later when this therapy hopefully turns out to have worked, this doesn't mean any proton beam miracle cure saved Ashya. The odds of disease free survival were thought to be slightly better with the chemo-radiotherapy Southampton was planning, and being pulled out of hospital and having his treatment delayed certainly will not have helped his chances. If he is disease free, that doesn't mean that he was saved by proton beam therapy, he is probably more likely to have been disease free with the conventional treatment.

With regards to the mortgage I figured that you either have to pay ERCs or you had to pay for a mortgage arrangement fee? Can you get ones with no fees and no ERCs?

We have gone through a couple of different scenarios regarding how much we could possible loose. If I look at the worst case scenarios on every instance, we could possible loose some money, but we have savings to cover us. 

But then again, if we account for a higher budget, no ERCs and no mortgage fees and sell it for what the estate agent estimates, we could walk away with a quite healthy profit. 

Being inexperienced in this kind of thing I think I am being quite reasonable in regards to spending and time scale (3-4 months), but I might be wrong.

Im not a fan of states created on ethnic nationalism,  its been an absolute shambles wherever its been tried, state based oppression of minorities. Rhodesia, south Africa, northern Ireland, Sri Lanka, Burma, Israel. Hardly the most stable and enlightened nations there. What happens to non Kurds in the new kurdistqn, what rights do they have, will they have equal rights? Will they be ethnically cleansed to make way for the Kurds, will those people and those nations be properly recompensed for their land? Those are the kinds of questions which if not properly dealt with will lead to massive instability  in years to come. The Kurdistan region of Iraq should realign with the Iraqi government, they are Iraqis and the Shia Iraqis are certainly not their enemy.

In Iraq, the Kurds already had an autonomous region, self managing with a cut of the of the oil revenues, a kind of power sharing agreement. Isn't that a good way forward, autonomy and agreement, rather than violence and taking other peoples land? If they force it through violence it will only come back later on. 

If there is justification for a Kurdish nation, then surely it can be fought for and argued for without killing anyone. The arguments for a Kurdish nation aren't particularly convincing to me and I have no particular allegiance in the fight. I honestly don't think a Kurdish nation would be any less oppressed than they are today, depending on who is in power and which militant organisations are on play in the decades after its creation it could be a permanent warzone.

Still fair fucks to them for bringing it to choudary. As far as I'm concerned all those people should be given good citizenship awards.

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** Many people with hyperpigmentation issue have better success with physical ss, so I thought it wouldn't hurt to try. This got the most rec on MUA SCB, so I ordered one. I also like the fact that it's chockful of aox.

This ss dries off quite bit tacky (feels a bit rubbery, if that makes sense), but also dries off clear and matte with no whitecast on me (NC35) but I have to really spread it well unless there'll be white streaks and patches on my face which can be easily fixed with rubbing it in a bit more, but that would defeat the purpose of coating the skin with protection. Although it feels like you have something on, it's feels lightweight and doesn't slide around and doesn't feel like it's melting when you're sweating.

Many people claim it also doubles as primer. Too bad, this doesn't work as one for me. This makes most of foundations that I use and also my HG concealer separate and pool in pores in 3 hours. Nothing a couple swipes with my fingers can't fix, but that's just annoying. Luckily, I don't wear foundation on daily basis, only concealer and setting powder. But when I have to look special on events that starts/is held in/since daylight, that becomes a problem.
It is also quite drying on my skin, so I had to pile on my serum. I've been a bit iffy with moisturizer since there aren't so many that i really like. When the air is humid, it's fine. But when I'm stuck at the air-conditioned office, my face does get dry and flaky around evening. I suspect the flakes came from my SD flareups, since this ss contains cyclops. Many products contanining cyclo-xanes look like it slightly hovers on top of skin. It's a bit hard to picture, but that's a common case with SD-prone. This ss does it to me.

I've never worn this out baking myself in the sun. My use of this has only been on coincidental exposures in the car to the office or to meetings. I mostly stay indoors until late for work. So, I can't attest to its full protection in the sun, just yet.
However I noticed that with SkinAqua, my freckles didn't improve, and with this they're a bit less noticeable.

Would you kindly explain this statement for me? What counts as large? You know that the largest ones help the most people and are often much more cost-effective? Is a hospital charity large? 

&gt; I think charity should be for unexpected events like earthquakes or disasters that need unexpected funds. Everyday care and basic needs shouldn't be an extra!

I agree, we're arguing but I think we're both coming from the same place. Essential services should be delivered free at the point of delivery and we shouldn't need voluntary organisations to do that.

The role of Parliament is to scrutinise the work of Government with the Education Committee monitoring the policy, administration and spending of the Department for Education and its associated arms length bodies, including Ofsted. Finding out where the public think the committee should focus their attentions in the forthcoming Parliament is extremely useful for guiding their work.

* ***I use sunscreen in dosage as recommended for advertised protection on the label. 1/4 tsp each for face and neck and about 2 tablespoons/1 shot glass for the whole body. Experience published is based on such usage.***

**Name of product:** Bioderma Photoderm Max SPF50+ Spray (UVA 33)

**Price of product:** €21 for 200ml

**Where did you purchase:** I forgot :/ I think it was Watsons in Singapore

**Product claims:** 

* *Guarantees optimum UVA/UVB protection against the harmful effects of the sun (sunburn, sun intolerance, etc.)*
* *Activates the skin's natural defences, protects from risks of cellular damage and combats premature cutaneous ageing: Cellular Bioprotection® biological patent*
* *Smooth texture, colourless upon application, no greasy effect, no white traces*
* *Excellent tolerance*

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** I've only tried a couple European brands for ss. I used to hate Bioderma for its hideously greasy and tacky (albeit blotting for numerous times with tissue papers and powder) ultra-fluide formula (tinted). After a few months failing to find another high-protective and comfortable ss, I figured it's time to give Bioderma another shot. I picked the light spray this time.

I was quite highly disappointed on first attempt. It was still shiny and tacky, plus there was noticeable whitecast. It didn't go away even after I powdered my face.

So the next day, I tried to wait longer (like 20-mins) before putting anything on my face. The whitecast dissipates quite a lot, although still noticeable on my medium skin. My sister said my face looked ""purple"". I blot my face (don't flame me! it's the only thing I can make my face looks presentable) lightly with a paper towel or an oil film and my face is ready for anything I'm going to put on my face.
It grabs onto powders and it makes it looks like I put on a nice foundation. It somewhat functions as primer as well as it keeps my makeup from sliding off my face, although it doesn't help with the oil.

For my babysister, whose skin is fairer than mine, she loves it a lot and foregoes any base makeup daily to campus. It's initially tacky and shiny, too, on her. But she usually lets it dries off herself on her way to campus. And according to her, it makes her skin looks smooth that her friends are asking.

It's quite hydrating and moisturizing for my combo-oily dehydrated skin (my skin is usually flake-guaranteed at the office) but also wears comfortable and feels really light. It feels and looks even better if I have to spend my time outside (not in an AC-ed environment).

I still have to attest its power under scorching hot sun for hours. But for daily use, it really kept my chemically exfoliated skin protected. No darkening of freckles or spots, which is good.

I will only repurchase this to use on my body because it does have great protection but it leaves too much whitecast for my skintone. I also can't use this outside summer on my face due to cyclopentasiloxane that aggravates my SD.

The motive appears to have been revenge against their father and his new partner, who were named as a cult leader and cult member respectively.

All details described by the children were either fabricated by the mother or fabricated by the children under significant duress. People tend to interpret specific claims as being more likely to be accurate or true, though specificity and accuracy is unlinked. The claims made in the videos have been determined by an investigation to be untrue. To read about some similar cases in which children were coached or coerced into describing horrific and bizarre abuse at the hands of non-existent Satanic cults, refer to the Day-care Sex-abuse hysteria in the 80's and 90's in the US.

Here is what actually happened (adding to what a number of commenters have pointed out in this thread):

 - Ashya developed medulloblastoma (a tumour of the brainstem)

 - Ashya had the tumour excised in southamptom. When treating cancer, the protocol is (for most cancers) to resect the tumour if possible, then use chemoradiotherapy to sweep up for little bits left behind. This needed to start promptly.

 - Ashya was on a NG (nasogastric) feeding tube and was showing signs of developing an infection, so people were understandably concerned.

 - The parents wanted Proton therapy. The trust discussed it with them and pointed out that it would make absolutely no difference in his case. The parents disagreed because traumatised people make stupid decisions. The trust agreed to refer him since the parents were willing to pay.

 - Then, they took him for a walk in the hospital grounds and ran off with him, leaving the power cable for the NG feeding tube on the ward. The unit has a small battery but it's not for prolonged use. 

 - Ashya also has no gag reflex, and if the tube got displaced he could've choked to death on aspirated food. Plus the infection. Plus the parents didn't tell anyone; they just vanished.

 - Then they didn't give him the therapy that he needed for much longer than he should've been left.

I really do feel for them, but the parents made a series of very stupid decisions that endangered their child moreso than was neccesary, for no real tradeoff. And the media has been cheering them on for some reason.

Besides which, Ashya is not 'Cancer free'. He is in exactly the same state as he was after the surgery; the tumour has not relapsed *yet*, and can't be seen on what I presume was either CT or MRI. We generally wait for at least five years to say that they are cancer free.

&gt;“First of all, as a result of immigration combined with weak labour standards in some sectors, there was a direct effect on wages, especially in lower skilled jobs.”

&gt;He told me they were sleeping nineteen or twenty to a house.
And they were paid far less than the factory was paying before.
Less than the minimum wage.
It worked out at about £4 an hour.
He got the union involved to sort it out.
But there are lots of stories like this, of wages having been pushed down.
They are the hidden stories of Britain.
They are the stories that make people angry.
They are stories that politicians have ignored for too long.
They are not good for the people of Britain.

Labour is hardly an anti immigration party.

&gt;So.. any other 'problems' you can think of???

Pressure on housing and services. Racial tensions between immigrants and natives, and between different immigrant groups. 

The whole concept of opening up our job market to people from much poorer countries such as Eastern Europe is flawed. 

&gt;The only open door we have is to EU. All studies show that EU immigrants are a boon to our economy/GDP, better educated and less likely to take benefits. No need to limit them as they are contributing wonderfully.

No, studies show that on AVERAGE EU immigration benefits us economically, which means there are some immigrants who take from the system, but they are made up for by other immigrants who are a net benefit to the economy. This is an argument in favour of controlled immigration, as we would be able to have more immigrants who are a benefit, and less who are a drain.

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.
In this sunscreen context, despite of the fitzpatrick skin type, my naked skin burns first before tans. 

**Your opinion:** I think, out of all sunscreens I've tried over the past few years, this one is by far the most protective.

I'll get into the texture and feel first. It's a lotion with light lotion-y scent that spreads around the skin easily, that's on the thicker side of the lotion spectrum. It does give a pretty strong whitecast at first, but the whitecast dissipates in a couple minutes. It really didn't take long. Which is very helpful for medium-tan skinned people like me. Unfortunately, I feel that it does stay shiny, greasy and tacky. It does dry down beautifully velvety in *a couple hours*, but it is always already time to reapply when it finally dries down.

However, despite the cons described above, as I said, this seems to be the most tenaciously protective sunscreen, at least for my skin. 3 years ago, this was my sunscreen of choice for the trip I and my graduate school friends arranged to say goodbye after a lovely year together. We decided to stay at our Greek friend's family farm in Korfu. I seriously baked myself in the scorching hot sun every single day. From midday to sundown. But, I also religiously reapply my sunscreen very, very liberally every 2 hours and/or every dip in the sea. 4-days passed and my friends are puzzled why I don't look tanned yet. 5th day, I fell asleep while sunbathing and missed 2(!) reapplications. That's when I and my friends realized my skin finally turned.
Other than that, my skin always looked fresh and smooth each time after I took off the sunscreen. My freckles, dare I say, faded a bit and looked less noticeable.

I wouldn't wear it for daily use, but I would use it when I plan to spend the day baking myself in the sun, whenever I can get my hands on more.

It started with linking academic institution together, and, of course, encountered the same naming problem that ARPANET did.  JANET, on X.25 solved this with NRS, the name resolution service, which had a few differences from the ARPANET DNS.

In the UK, we were a bit more aware of the need for international scope from the start, so the decision was made to start each name with the country code.

Then, in a similar vein, there was the idea to split the name space by function.  This gave, initially: AC (academic); CO (Comercial) and MOD (Minsitry of Defence).

Entities that didn't fall into one of these got to be directly under UK; although there were very few back then (given CO captured many entities; things like the NHS were amoung the few that got one).

When the time came to merge with the ARPANET, the NRS names were mapped onto DNS names.  This included swapping them round, as NRS stared with the country code: e.g. UK.AC.CAM, rather than cam.ac.uk.  Also, they were generally specified in capitals, whereas DNS was generally specified in lower case.

JANET's policy of strict enforcement of names was carried through to the DNS registrar, so commercial entities were forced to be in .co.uk.  It was around this time that the other TLD's were imported in .uk (org.uk, gov.uk), but not edu or mil, because we already had ac and mod.

So that's the history of it.

There's also a technical reason, although that's less relevant today.  To look up an unknown name, you first contact the . (dot, or root) registry, to find where the .uk master records are.  Then you ask the .uk registry where .co.uk is.  Then you ask .co.uk where bbc.co.uk is.

There  is a trade off between having smaller registries (easier to search individually), and having fewer steps.  Although we could probably stuff all the names into a single computer today, the design of the name system means that that isn't needed - which is good, because in the .com boom, it would probably have failed at some point (as demand for names grew faster than computer speed for a while).

**Your opinion:** I bought this on winter 2 years ago (2013), opting for the tinted one, hoping to shorten my morning routine by skipping base makeup. Plus, I'm tired of dealing with horrendous sunscreen whitecast on my medium-tan skin.
However, the color is so pink it turned my face into a horrendous mauve-purple colour. It's also way darker than my skintone (NC30-40), making my face looked muddy.

It does feel lightweight, but stays slick and shiny and made my makeup looked cakey. I persisted in wearing it, but it finally broke me out in cystic acne after a week (suspected form the isocetyl stearate), so now I never know how good the protection it provides.

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** The colour is surprisingly a perfect match to my skin in summer (NC35-40) and it gives me great coverage, eradicating the need of tinted moisturizer or bb cream.
But other than that, I don't have too many good things to say about the ss. It stays greasy and shiny, although it lessens a bit as the day goes on, which is not much of a use when you wear it in summer heat and have to reapply constantly. I always have to blot with at least 2 paper napkins, but it doesn't help much. When I wear it in warmer days, it makes my sunglasses keep sliding off my nose.

Last summer (2014), it started to make my face stings, red, itchy and breaking out in hives whenever I went out in the sun wearing this ss.

The search for the perfect ss continues....

**Product claims:** *[Ratzilla Cosme - Nivea Sun Protect Skin Creamy UV Essence](http://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/nivea-sun-protect-plus-skin-creamy-uv-essence/)*

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** *First impression:* lotion texture, very lightweight, applies white but disappears within a minute and no whitecast whatsoever, no tackiness/greasiness, but dries a tad shiny which can be easily taken care of with a light dusting of powder. Dries velvety at first, within a few minutes, no hydration or moisture. Will need a moisturizer underneath or wear moisturizing base on top. No stinging or burning feeling at all. Guess my face is highly sensitive to Avobenzone after all.

*Update 03/05/2015:* Just 3 days into trial of this sunscreen, I realized it's extremely drying and irritating, most possibly due to high concentration of alcohol. My skin would crinkle and I don't even have dry skin. I had to stop because my SD-prone area (the butterfly of face) was peeling and flaking a lot, plus it got red and painful. I'm not sure if it flared my SD since I didn't get the usual itchiness, blister and crust that come with an SD flareup.
I do have sensitive skin and I use a lot of strong actives in my routine (tretinoin, glycolic acid and azelaic acid) but never has it hurt or gotten irritated this much. Even when I resumed glycolic a few days into recovering, my face didn't tingle one bit and it actually helped my skin feeling less parched.

I already bought 3 bottles of this and 1 pump bottle and a refill pouch of the Water Gel from the same line. Seems that I shall resume trial, but I will layer oil/Vaseline underneath to buffer, hoping to eventually use them up, unless someone wants to take them off my hands.

I would recommend this to people easily as it has velvety, completely transparent, very lightweight finish that's barely shiny with pretty good protection, which is hard to come by, but I will not repurchase for myself.

The search continues.

*Update 10/05/2015:* After my skin fully recovered from the avobenzone irritation, it can tolerate the alcohol in this sunscreen so much better. I do, however, still buffer it with Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel topped with sunflower oil. My skin no longer crinkles as much, but I still find the finish somewhat a tad too drying for my taste.

Students from England on my course DO NOT receive this grant, they will have to repay £9,000.

Well [this report](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29910497) says that EU immigrants add £5 billion to the UK economy every year. We have been told that we need to be building 250,000 homes each year to keep up with demand, and we are currently building about half that. The Green party say they can build houses for £60,000 each, which is generally considered far too low an estimate, but even using that figure it would mean that we would need to invest an extra £7 billion each year into housing, which wipes out the benefit immigration adds to the country. And that does not take into account all the extra investment in public services required. 

If we actually invested in housing and services in line with immigration, I think people would question the economic benefit of immigration.

&gt;Racial tensions are really only an issue for racists.

That is a foolish and dismissive thing to say. If you want to ignore the racial tensions caused by immigration that's up to you but they exist and they are a real problem.

This is the kind of stuff that used to get written (about a man convicted of a rampage shooting being allowed to go to Laser Quest).

&gt; A VICTIM of Tyneside killer Robert Sartin's shooting spree is furious after the **gunman was given a day out - to fire at people in an electronic gun game**.

&gt;Robert Wilson slammed staff at top security Ashworth Hospital, on Merseyside, where the schizophrenic is kept, calling their actions ludicrous.

Nonsense! It's not like car insurance where there is an obvious risk of damage to other peoples property. If your house falls down, no one else is effected, it's your property - your problem.

&gt;Besides the utter foolishness of gambling with the weather that could destroy the house at any time and she'd lose everything without insurance to cover the cost,

If the weather is that bad where she lives, good luck finding an insurer that'll cover her!

&gt;what if a brick blows off the roof and hits a pedestrian? She would be liable for millions in compensation.

As long as your mother isn't letting the building go to complete and utter disrepair then I can't see anyone being able to make a claim for a freak accident like that. 

Roof tiles fall off houses and damage cars more often than you'd think, 90% of the time it is the car owner who is liable for the cost of any damage to their car.  To claim from the home owner, the car owner has to prove that they suffered loss due to negligence. If your roof is solid it's not your fault, an 'act of god' if you will. 

&gt;I don't want to report her to the council but if she leaves me no alternative then I have to.

I think you need to sit down, grab a drink and relax.

It's not just this. It's situations like United yest. that will test Rodgers mantle as a 'tactician'. He got us till here with these tactics, which have been fantastic. No team figured us out. 

Till yest. Van Gaal is not a buffoon, despite what the media and our fans tell us. He figured out how to use the wingbacks and a physical presence that wrecked us. He found a way to thwart Rodgers and his system.

So what now? What now? As always we will hang on the words 'he'll learn from this'. We said that at Chelsea last year. We said that at the start of this season. We said it in the CL. We said it in the Europa. 

As soon as he comes up against a huge test, he sinks. Machester City are on the wane. Southampton is not Liverpool level yet. Ronald Koemanis in his first season at Southampton.

Gerrard's stamp: Carra sums it up well in the Sky's post match analysis. Due to his great passion for Liverpool, he sometimes goes to far in derby games and is the 4 red cards against Utd and Everton is great evidence. Does not tarnish his reputation.

Moreno's a good attacker, but sometimes makes questionable decisions when defending (especially in big games). Left wing back in my opinion is one of our weakest link in defense. 

Sturridge looked confident, played better when Balo came on. Needs more support up top in the next games.

Mignolet has been fantastic since being dropped. His shot stopping is still superb and his punches are getting more and more solid. Though I felt that with his form he could save both Mata's shot but he's not to blame for both goals.

Brendan needs to have another stroke of genius for us to keep up the fight for top 4. Teams are figuring us out, and whilst he was  able to change it against Swansea (he changed it against United but that went down the drain after 30 secs) it leaves us only 45 mins to effectively win a game. It's gotten to a point where I no longer think we can play a 3 at the back formation. If we play with the 3-4-1-2, it's still too easy to isolate our attacking players and stop our passing game. If we play with the 4-4-2 diamond, then our fullbacks are extremely vulnerable. The advantage is we get two up top and are still able to dominate the midfield. I have enough confidence in our keeper and defence that we can be more solid with the diamond now, than we were 12 months ago, however a couple of bad results and the mistakes will start to seep in. It's a real tight rope, all systems have their weaknesses and yes the players have to play well for them to work, but we need to get this 100% right to have any chance of finishing top 4. 

Lucas should come in, Sterling surely has to be played further forward, people need to remember he's 20 and to not crucify him for playing poorly at wing back. Sakho and Skrtel as the back two, Can at RB as johsnon can't run anymore. I'd like to see Coutinho in a deeper role alongside Henderson but then you'd have to play Balotelli up top with Sturridge, which is risky. Most likely brendan will play a midfield of Lucas, Hendo, Allen and then Coutinho as the 10, with sterling and Sturridge up top.

Blackburn played two holding midfielders, congesting the space where Coutinho and Lallana had previously run amok. 

Swansea didn't congest that space; they generally kept their midfielders in front of them and blocked the supply to Lallana and Coutinho - Ki especially made sure Coutinho didn't get much of the ball. That's actually a better strategy - if you man-mark those two, you run the risk of them using their excellent touch and close control to escape and suddenly they've got a pocket of space. Add to that the fact that their diamond posed problems for us in terms of who was responsible for pressing who, and put their players in natural positions to intercept our passes, and that's why we improved when Rodgers switched us to a diamond to match theirs.

Meanwhile, United had their wide players drift inside to join Herrera and Fellaini in overloading the space behind Henderson and Allen. Like Swansea, they dealt with Lallana and Coutinho by cutting off the supply to them. There was also the added dimension of Fellaini outmuscling Can continuously, and Blind and Valencia creating problems for Moreno and Sterling in terms of whether to deal with the fullbacks or Young and Mata.",null,0,null,1427112495,null,0,false,0,cpnuq3o,null,t3_3001bb,null,t1_cpnuq3o,null,t1_cpnujlq,null,null,null,1431963413,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

Mikel and Ramires are two players that can play well, they can fill a role, and neither of them seem to mind being squad players. They're also players that are very limited, when they're bad they're awful, and at times are square pegs in round holes at Chelsea. 


As I mentioned in the OP I've felt that Ramires should be sold for years now, this isn't a kneejerk reaction about the weekends game where he was poor. He's had far more poor performances than good ones in my opinion. Though there were certainly other factors, in my opinion if you swapped Matuidi with Ramires in the CL games we'd be in the Quarters Finals right now.

This was pure madness from Stevie, I can understand a 50-50 tackle and he gets it wrong and is off. But this is extremely dirty, a really nasty deliberate stamp. If a United player did this I'd have wanted his ban extended.

They outplayed us first half, to have near 70% possession at Anfield as the away side is unheard of. This really was death by football, Van Gaal produced a tactical masterclass first 45. Brendan clearly changed it second half, I actually thought we would've been able to get something from the game due to the switch, but then Stevie did what he did.

Basic first aid, legal doorman like anybody else can carry out a citizens arrest as long as it's an ""either way"" offence or greater so a crime that could be dealt with either in a ~~magistrates court or higher~~an offence that because of the type could be heard in a crown court but might be heard in a magistrates court depending on the quantity, such as theft, possession of drugs, assault, aggravated trespass when a person is on private property and has been asked to leave the property but has refused to do so or has climbed over fences/ barriers/ broken windows etc. Ideally you would always get the police to arrest them such as by asking them to stay where they are and then ringing or radioing the police.  If you prevent them from leaving then you either have to formally arrest them or it's an unlawful detention (I can't remember the exact phrase).  Identifying different types of drugs by sight and their effects on the body eg. reduced pupils, unresponsive to light etc. Very basic self defence such as how to get out of certain holds and to immobilise somebody without hurting them......

Although the requirements do differ slightly a shop or office security guard only needs SIA (Security Industries Association)level 1 clearance whereas a doorman requires Level 2.  CCTV operators requires an additional course as do body guards and Door supervisors.

Edit: Shop lifting is a right bugger,  you can only detain them ""once they have passed the last means of payment (till) and our proceeding to the exit, with no intention to pay.""  But once they're outside it gets very dubious about whether you can detain them.  You can ask them firmly to return to inside the shop but if they refuse it's legally ""difficult"".  The police wont usually raise a problem but if it goes to court then their lawyer can cause grief.

Edit 2:  Theirs also some really obscure legal stuff like in a restaurant with a restaurant licence a person over the age of 16 may order two pints with a meal but not a snack like a bowl of chips.  A shop after either 23:00 or 00:00 (can't remember which) requires a night cafe licence in order to serve hot food, which includes food that the customer has heated up on the premises using a microwave.  Which is one reason why you aren't allowed inside a petrol station after 23:00.  So that you can't heat up a sausage roll or a pot noodle.

Edit 3:  Breach of the peace is an easy one to arrest somebody on as it's a really vague term that can cover more or less anything including being a pain in the arse and refusing to fuck off.

There's also lots of conflict management stuff, trying to calm people down so that a fight doesn't occur and understanding that due to the fight or flight response after adrenaline is produced you could be pulling a guy off a woman that he's trying to beat up but once you've got him off she might start attacking you including glassing you around the back off the head and shouting ""get off my boyfriend"".

The only tumours where PBT is generally accepted are skull Base tumours where conventional radiotherapy cannot be accurately targeted without causing unacceptable ""collateral damage"" to sensitive, but essential, nerves. 

For medulloblastoma, the accepted ""after treatment"" is whole brain and whole spine radiotherapy with a double dose to the tumour site. 

PBT generally doesn't offer significant extra radiation  dose to the treatment areas. The only demonstrated benefit of PBT for medulloblastoma is less collateral damage to body organs (Lungs, heart, liver). In general, even conventional radiotherapy won't hit these organs hard enough to cause significant short term injury; thus the benefit becomes one of lower long term (20 -  40 year) risk of radiation induced cancer in the body. Even that has to be set against the high long term risk if brain and spine tumours from whole brain/spine radiation. 

The relative lack of robust scientific validation and limited likely benefits of PBT doesn't stop it being heavily marketed. ",null,0,null,1427114365,null,0,false,0,cpnvanm,null,t3_2zzogh,null,t1_cpnvanm,null,t1_cpnssuf,null,null,null,1431963683,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

It's rather different that they can speak German rather.

I very strongly disagree with your opinion that Ramires did nothing wrong, his inability to keep hold of the ball was a constant nuisance to us and allowed Hull opportunities to break. As much as we were level because of poor mistakes defensively, we were also only really ahead because of two fantastic shots coupled with poor defending from Hull. Even in between our two goals Hull had a great opportunity to equalise when they had a player put through one on one with Courtois. We had been clinical rather than dominant in the first 10 minutes. 


You mention the Southampton game, and I agree in that game his substitution had a positive effect on us and we were unfortunate to not go on and win the game. As for his pass completion:


http://i.imgur.com/r0kYTZO.jpg


I think when you compare the two charts you can see he was playing a lot of low risk square passes in the Southampton game, and when he tried to move the ball forward against Hull he was often misplacing it. Ramires is a lot of things, but a great passer isn't one of them. This is a little bit what I meant in the OP where I said


&gt; Just looking up his pass completion stats, which I think aren't always good for showing a player played well, but are for showing when a player has played poorly


Overall with Ramires I just feel too often he is a square peg for a round hole at Chelsea, he has his good days, but more often than not I can't help but feel the club needs someone that not only can bring the work rate Ramires does, but also offers more threat to the opposition, and more stability to Chelsea, when on the ball.

Comparing the HTB ISA with access to lump sum is a different kettle of fish. 

* /u/Borax originally suggested that if you get below 5% ROI on your other investment vehicle that the HTB ISA is worth it. This only compared a lump sum investment directly to a HTB ISA with a regular investment schedule.

* In reality you need to compare a lump sum investment to a HTB ISA with a regular investment schedule with the remaining funds still in the lump sum investment vehicle. My own calculations suggest that if you get below a ~8.5% ROI on your other investment vehicle then the HTB ISA is worth it. This assumes 0% interest rate on the HTB ISA which is unlikely - roughly speaking add the interest rate of the HTB ISA to 8.5% to get the new threshold.

Whether you fund the HTB ISA using regular income, or by drawing down a lump sum, the thresholds that make it worthwhile are still fairly high.

It seems ridiculous to me that there are calls to change the system so quickly. Maybe little tweaks like two up top, and not Sterling at wingback. But to completely drop the part of the system which has seen our turnaround in form for four at the back which has been disastrous for a season and a half. Crazy.

Our players are having a little dip in performance, it happens. But we have also had a tough run in. I'll be worried if things don't look better over the 4 games vs Newcastle, Hull/Villa, West Brom as QPR.

It's a toss-up. It was more reminiscent of Costs's stamp on *him* than the one on Can, and if I recall, Costa was banned for the one an Can as the one on Skrtel could be argued as unintentional. Provided I'm right there, a similar defence can get Skrtel out of a ban he probably deserves.

&gt;Gerrard

Obviously his Liverpool career isn't tarnished at all. But he'll serve his suspension, and probably interior disciplinary action too. The gravity of what he did, and the message he sent out is the issue. He comes on the pitch and gets everyone excited, ready for us to push on in the second half and take the game by the scruff of the neck. And in under a minute he's gone. He killed hope in the team and hope in the fans and that damaged us massively. He didn't single-handedly lose us the game and the Top 4, but he made both *significantly* more difficult.

&gt;Defense

Skrtel was solid as always. Sakho was isolated and put under a lot of pressure all game long because Moreno was monumentally awful. Sakho did the best he could, but when he has to do backheel flicks to get out of situations that Moreno has left him in, you know where the problem there lies. Moreno was at fault for both goals and he was completely outclassed yesterday. Can was okay. Daley Blind had the run of him a few times, and he got over run on occasion but he was just alright. We're missing Lucas. He just has such a presence in the midfield and allows everyone else to play better, that's something we *can* see from Allen, but it's not to be relied upon. 

&gt;Sturridge

Clinical. I hope he's back, but we'll have to give it some more time to see. He was picking up better positions yesterday, but he was isolated quite often with Sterling and Lallana having to track back. Give him time and hopefully he'll pick up some more goals against Arsenal. We need him now more than ever. 

&gt;Mignolet

Couldn't do anything for either goal. Great penalty save. Looked *slightly* less convincing than the last couple of games, but then again who didn't? Very impressed and if he can keep his form up, he'll probably get the golden glove. If teams can't score, we can't lose. Simple as that.

&gt;Game as a whole

We were awful and outclassed. United were stronger in possession and played to their strengths better than we did. 10 men didn't help at all and we probably could have made a proper game of it in the second half with 11, maybe even won it. When we were on top we looked utterly dominant (30-45 minutes), and they couldn't keep up with the pace of play between Sturridge, Sterling, Coutinho and Lallana. But when we went down to ten, that pace became inherently unsustainable.

We move on to Arsenal, suspension(s) in queue, and we *need* a win. Emirates is an awful place to go and get a result, but shit we absolutely need one to have any hope whatsoever of making it into the top 4.

Trail bikes can be a bit different and need more slack, but since you're so far from home I'm guessing you have a road bike.

Get some disposable gloves. With the engine **off** and in neutral, sit on the bike and roll it forwards about 20cm at a time, using your left hand to feel for the tightest spot every time you stop. Keep your hand clear when you are rolling it.

Once you have the tightest spot, slacken the wheel spindle and adjust the chain so that you have about 20-30mm of slack at that point with you sitting on the bike. Some bikes have different requirements for slack, but that's typical. Make sure you move both sides of the wheel by the same amount. If you are turning a bolt to draw the wheel back, you usually only need to turn a few flats (1/6's of a turn), so don't over-tighten. Refasten the wheel spindle. If you don't have a torque wrench with you, do it up as tightly as you can. This is one bolt you're unlikely to be able to over-tighten.

No, the network knows where the money is going from and where it is going too. But in reality (as in, IP addresses, real world locations) it is impossible to tell.

null,false,Torustorustorus,null,null,null,"Compare to Soton last year, and this problem is especially perplexing as Soton was 6th best in defense. The easy answer would be ""it's a result of several things"", but I've got a few theories :

1) I think it's a result of the mix of talent available in the midfield. There's no Wanyama here to help the defense. I suppose bentaleb and Mason are both to important to the general operation, or stambouli and capoue can't convince Poch, but the result is that Poch system, as we knew it coming into the season, used a defensive mid and allow the center defense to play wider to cover for the highly advanced fullbacks. I am not suggesting benching Mason or bentaleb in favor of a DM makes the team better overall, but I do wonder if Poch is trying, still, to figure out how to match his best talent with the way he knows to build a strategy. Bentaleb and Mason are nice and bust their ass, but it's not the same. 

2) vertonghen has had an unstable partner, which probably hasn't helped. 

3) I know we love him, but it could be that vertonghen isn't as good as we want him to be. Or, maybe he is, but he's not the kind of guy who you can have as the best defender on your line, and if he's expected to be the leader then things go wrong? Just throwing it out there.

No leadership and poor individual tackling ability (Vertonghen is terrible at tackling a player moving towards him) are important, but the system is obviously where everything falls flat.

Lots of people laughed at Sherwood or one of his assistants last year when they talked about how they didn't like playing with a purely defensive Makele type player but we're using two box-to-box central midfielders now in Bentaleb and Mason and it's showing in our disturbing inability to stop teams from scything through the middle of the pitch. A real deep lying playmaker has to be good defensively (Modric is an obvious example of this), not just a frantic, energetic ball of unguided energy like Mason. 

Our wingers have been poor for most of the season, which combined with their inclination to cut inside has meant that our fullbacks are pushing up and getting stuck out of position and being forced to use their athleticism to recover.

The high press that Poch loves may just not be tenable for a whole season (outside of a few limited cases of teams with world class players across the board). Southampton had similar problems last season (remember our recovery against them at WHL?) and it's also meant that the team seems confused when they do take the lead.

His speed and shooting just caused havoc for defenses, and could do wonders for someone like Kane as he would help to pull pressure off of him. As for the youth side, I'm all for looking at them, but they would have to be a third string for us right off the bat. 

As for Lamela, yes, Bale plays as a winger but that only really leaves you with Chadli and Townsend.  I don't know about you, but that is not good enough for me.  


Let's be honest, our CB's are kind of a mess.  I won't put all of our defensive issues on their backs because they don't get the support that they need, but Kaboul just can't cut it anymore, Chiriches is the ultimate high-risk/high-reward player and is just too risky at times, and Fazio, well, he should be getting some more time.  Dier is going to be really good, but he's young.  Vertonghen has to be the first CB on the sheet, but that's just because he's the best out of the rest.  Wimmer is a young talent and to think that he could come in and take the place of Vertonghen would be a big mistake in my book.  He's in his first season of top-flight play, and I don't want to put all our eggs in that basket.  I think he's more likely a replacement for one or both of Chiriches and Kaboul.

null,false,Tony49UK,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"I used to be a bar man on an army base South of London and went out with the guys on the piss.  These were all guys in phase two training and about 18ish I was 25 at the time and OLD.  It was obvious in the afternoon around about 4PM that they were going to kick off, either with themselves or somebody else.  I tried getting the 30-40 odd to calm down and to calm things down with the bar staff but in the end just decided to go home early.  A few of them ended up in the cells that night both civil police and the barracks's own cells.  

The main reason I think it is, is because on the base everything is so regimented and controlled.  They wouldn't even think about complaining at the base bar if it took them 20 minutes to get served because the bar maid was chatting to their boy friend.  And if they get into a fight on base they're bollocksed.  There was a fight in my bar once when I was off duty.  The rules for staff were simple.  Get behind the bar lock the doors to the bar (behind the hatch) and drop the shutters.  Leave it to the duty corporal and the guard to sort it out.  We had one girl who was ""I'm a hard nut from Glasgow"", went out in to the fight and got wacked aound the head with a snooker ball by a Gurkha.  EVERY Gurkha got fined £500 (2003 ish) and gated (base arrest) for a month and a lot of them had families relying on that cash.

You also have to understand that these are guys who spend all day learning to fight and then can't understand why when they do, they get into trouble.  To be honest a lot of them are thicker then two short planks.

And the way the army pays them they all get paid on the last working day of the month and for many that wage is the most money they've ever seen or really heard of in their lives.  So they spunk it all in the first two weeks and are broke the second two weeks, so then they want a really good time when they get some money again and then spunk it all.

One thing which people were also forgetting yesterday is that we've played 47 games so far this season. We only played 43 in all of 13/14. I do think it's reached the point where it's taking it's toll. Even though we increased the size of the squad in the summer, we're still not on par with the teams around us when it comes to depth and we haven't really rotated the squad in other competitions very much, it's always been the same core. 

United have played 11 games less and yesterday they looked fitter and sharper. We were second to everything all game. Our system only works when we are the ones pressing, and that is very hard against a fitter team. Last season we benefited from the lack of European commitments, and now it's hurting us.

I do think that to get back to our previous form we are going to need to freshen things up and rest a few of week-in-week-out starters which is a big risk.

I'm on the fence about Vertonghen - I think i'd sell him for the right price to be honest. He's not reached the same level that he was at his first season, and a lot of the time he doesn't seem to care. We can get a good price for him and I wouldn't be too upset to see him go. Again, only for the right fee/replacement though. He is our best defender.

I basically put Vertonghen in because his value is high and I think that would be better than selling, say, Capoue *and* Chiriches *and* someone else. Selling 6 players in exchange for 1 is already hitting your squad depth quite hard, and 8 would be too many.

Chiriches, again, i'm on the fence about. I want to see him play more so I can juge his ability, but at the same time he's a risky player, so I'm a bit scared about playing him... I'd give him another season and see how it goes, because I think he's got talent.

I like Capoue. I think with a bit of work, confidence and a stretch of games he could be the next Sandro. Obviously I love Mason and Bentaleb but I'm not sure Mason is good enough to get us into the top 4. Capoue and Stambouli, however, might have the potential.

null,false,bustedracquet,null,null,null,"I 100% agree with you OP on your points about Ramires, but here's the problem, Jose isn't going to give any time to a non-experienced PL player in the middle of the title race. If this was another point in the season, I think RLC might actually get minutes, and I honestly think that RLC will take Ramires' spot next year. But I think it's too much to ask given the current situation we are in, every game matters so much. If RLC were to fuck up in a big match, not only would his confidence be shattered, but the fans would probably crucify him and Jose for putting him in the situation in the 1st place. 

I fully understand what Jose is doing with RLC, he definitely thinks he's got the ability to be an important player for us in the future, but he wants to protect him, and make sure he's 100% ready, before he throws him into the fire that's there when you play at Chelsea FC, because you're constantly being analyzed, praised, and criticized whenever you're a player for our team, and that's a lot to handle for a 19-year old kid. I mean just look at what's happened with Oscar. 3 months ago we thought he was the absolute shit and on his way to being one of the top No. 10's in the world, and now the fan base wants him consistently dropped for the next few matches because of how poor he's been. 

All in all, I still think Ramires is the best option for the rest of the season because of the experience he has, his work rate, and how he can give you an amazing 30 minutes as a sub, like he did last week against Southampton. However, I'm done with seeing him in the double pivot, and most importantly, I don't think we will have to see him in the double pivot much anymore, because I think once Mikel is back, Jose will go with Matic-Mikel in away fixtures. And while Mikel does nothing to contribute to the attack, he can pass the ball well enough, and that's fine with me. 

I agree with you though that in the summer, Ramires needs to be sold, and I think a team that would suit him perfectly is Juventus. Juve needs box-to-box mids that have a phenomenal work rate, and are willing to run all day between attack and defense, and the fact that they have a midfield diamond with Pirlo behind him, I think Ramires' passing flaws could be masked.

I know a lot about Bitcoin. I think it's hilarious, and the people who use it and preach it are doubly so. 

Look, in terms of Bitcoins use for money laundering it has to be convertible from or to GBP to be useful. 

So it's very simple to regulate. All you do is make sure that any business in the UK that either swaps Bitcoin for GBP, or swaps GBP for Bitcoin must do the standard 'Know your customer' (KYC) stuff that banks do at the moment. 

So if someone is putting money into Bitcoin, the government know about it. And if someone is getting money out of Bitcoin, then the government know about it. 

It's not all that important what the Bitcoin is doing after it exits the company and flies about on the blockchain. At least not for stopping money laundering. 

Bitcoins only real use at the moment is the fact that it can be swapped for fiat. So that's the part you regulate.

Because anyone can create a bitcoin from any pc.

If i created one now on my PC and stored it on my local wallet, how are the government going to trace me. Likewise if i send that bitcoin i've just created to someone else and they send me a product or service in return. How are the government going to trace me or the provider of that product/service.

Then that provider could also trade that BTC with someone else for another product or service.

This is all being done without the government knowing a thing, and then oh look; the bitcoin is being transferred into a currency other than sterling. **WOW!!**. Now its outside of British government regulation. Amazing...

If I was an opposition manager and Ramires had the ball I would not worry one bit about him picking out a pass to put my team in trouble. 


We're going to have to agree to disagree about yesterday, as I can't see how you can have watched that and think he was anything but poor. I'll not comment on the West Ham game as I was unable to watch it, but the Everton game in the first half of the season is a good example of when Ramires is at his best, in that sort of open end to end contest that we rarely are part of. He is a squad player, and he has his moments, but Chelsea could easily improve on him with a squad player that isn't so reliant on having space to run into to be at his best. I'm not saying he's a completely shit player, but there's no way I can be convinced that Chelsea wouldn't be better off with a central midfielder that fits the way we play better. There's a reason why our central midfield was in such dire need of signings when Mourinho became manager, why we look so much better with Matic and Fabregas than we ever did when Ramires was starting week in week out. 


And your point about it being a tactical decision is beside the point, whether it's true or not, I was showing you how him having a high pass % in the Southampton game was largely meaningless because the passes he was making were simple ones. When he tries to pass the ball aggressively, which we need our central midfielders to do particularly when teams are backed up defensively, he can't do it.

Bitcoin hasn't reached that level of maturity yet. If I need Bitcoin I'm going to have to exchange fiat for it. I'm not going to fucking swap physical goods for Bitcoin if I want to use or invest in it.

&gt;But if you really wanted GBP, you could use an exchange not under the UK's jurisdiction, hence bitcoin is unable to be regulated by the British government.

You could yes, forgetting the uncertainty and lack of protection when buying outside of the UK&lt; you also ignore the fact that using FIAT always leaves a record. Sure I can buy Bitcoin from abroad but if HMRC investigates my accounts and asks me where the money is going I will need an adequate answer. You cannot just funnel money out of the country with impunity. Any funds coming or going can be questioned by HMRC. If you are buying goods/services you will have to show them a reciept, if you are buying currency they will want to know where it's going/what it's for.

&gt;Aslong as they are in Britain yes, but the Government will not have much luck elsewhere.

Erm.... that's the point. To regulate it within the UK. They aren't seeking to regulate Bitcoin itself, it's impossible as you have stated, nobody is seriously claiming otherwise and if they are, they are talking from their arsehole.

I am a huge Bitcoin supporter and have been for years but you seem to be purposefully ignoring the issue here in exchange for making a bollocks point about ""you can't regulate Bitcoin"" - well done, you are stating the obvious.

For Bitcoin to really flourish it needs regulation and framework from the UK Government and it's tax authorities otherwise businesses and individuals who which to use Bitcoin in the UK face massive uncertainty. Not to mention problems with holding bank accounts. Most banks won't touch you with a barge pole if they hear you are dealing in Bitcoin, numerous exchanges and individuals have had their accounts closed and forced to shut up shop because of the lack of regulation in the UK.

So whilst you cannot regulate Bitcoin itself, you can regulate it's use to some degree by regulating companies and individuals which are exchanging GBP for Bitcoin and vice versa.

I'll give you an example, I have a company and I bought some Bitcoin 5 years ago. My accountant knew exactly what it was but when it came to my tax planning, he had no idea what to do and neither did HMRC. They wanted to charge me VAT on both the buying/selling of it which is complete madness.  HMRC eventually distributed an advisory which resolved that issue but there are still huge problems associated with anyone wanting to be involved in Bitcoin in the UK.

I think Poch needs to clear out a lot of mediocrity in the midfield this summer, and bring in some of his own guys in both midfield and defense that fit his system better. Quality over quantity. The problem is that who knows if the players he needs to bring in are within Levy's budget or wage structure.

I fully believe that bringing in just one fully complete midfielder at the upper end of the budget who can start week in and week out (like Schneiderlin ~~or~~ ~~Cabaye~~) would do wonders for the team. If that means selling 2-3 midfielders just to bring in one, then so be it.

&gt;Aston Villa Review: Episode 113 - recapping March
 
&gt;Aston Villa Review is back after a brief absence, and we were certainly frustrated by the timing of our enforced break. Since the last episode, Aston Villa have been in fine shape, defeating West Bromwich Albion twice to bank their first three points for an age and secure a place in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Not a bad start to the month, and a 4-0 win at Sunderland was the icing on the cake.

&gt;In this week's show we'll take a whistle-stop tour of the whole damned lot including the most recent game, Saturday's 1-0 home loss at the hands of Swansea City. There's also a quick assessment of Tim Sherwood's managerial performance over his first month in charge. We'll be back next week to look ahead to the first knockings of April.

Skrtel.

&gt;2) Gerrard is English, Costa isn't. English players from Sterlings slap in front of an official, Rooney's bad behavior, will always get preferential treatment from the media. See Souness rant on foreigners diving versus the principled English players.
Or Gary Neville, who is great, but he gives English players a far nicer time, then foreigners, which I guess given he works with the England squad is unsurprising.

Skrtel.

&gt; 3) Time constraints, from what I remember they had to go straight to the Hull Chelsea, game so couldn't devote their time exclusively to the coverage of the potential stamps. I think Skrtel's should definitely get more coverage though. Whether he bans or not is 50/50 as Costa was banned for the Can stamp not the one similar to Skrytel.
In summary, are the media bias? Yes, they're mostly pro English, pro Liverpool. Is this sufficient evidence for campaign not these specific examples. Gerrard has historically always got a free pass on the media, as would be expected for any English player,

Skrtel.

Wasn't this all blown out of proportion a bit? I seem to remember reading that it wasn't anywhere near as bad as reports bad out.

I'm all for trying to resolve issues of ""extremism"" but again, as always with Government they seem to be ignore all social issues that contribute, and rather than ""fix"" things they ""clamp down"" which does nothing but force groups further underground etc

And, as this article suggests, appears to be aimed squarely at one and only one group of extremists, i.e. Muslims. Why not the other groups I have mentioned, and the others I am sure there are?

Finally, all our laws already prohibit extremism of the sorts they are discussing anyway, funnily enough the HRA and ECHR does a good job of ensuring security against that sort of thing, and she's an advocate for doing away with it!

They are community courts that are basically agreements between neighbours. Nothing more, UK court can and always will over rule it.  Even calling them a court is nonsense.  I'm not even sure what the Government could do to stop them as they have absolutely no official capacity what so ever.

I think everyone has to sit down and realise that the world is changing very quickly now.  I currently live in Thailand and see jobs advertised here paying well in excess of similar jobs in the UK.  Ten year's ago and the wages would have been a third of those in the UK.  If you have just about any real specialism everywhere else will pay more money.  This is why the UK is suffering from 'Brain drain'.  You educate to a high level but you don't have the jobs for the intelligent people to do (outside of research).  So, they depart for just about anywhere else.

The good thing about the UK is if you have no drive at all, and you just want to either clean toilets, stack shelves (or other similar non or semi skilled job) then you'll get minimum (or a few quid more) wage.  Or if you're happy doing a pointless non-job like working for a local authority, or in the Civil Service.  Then those will pay very good wages.  Elsewhere in the world you can't get that kind of money for such pointless waste of life jobs.  

However, if you want to do something real with your life, pack your bags and get the fuck out.  The UK is done, over, finished, the Gvt are just putting it to bed.

**Where did you purchase:** On eBay from [this seller](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Biore-UV-Aqua-Rich-Watery-Sunscreen-Essence-SPF-50-PA-NEW-2015-FORMULA/131262480133?_trksid=p3693.c100102.m2452&amp;_trkparms=ao%3D1%26asc%3D20140212121249%26meid%3Db7648c2993924d78882e6c264032805e%26pid%3D100102%26).

**Product claims:** Kao claims that it applies like water, making for a very smooth finish and a great base for make up. Hyaluronic acids in the formula helps retain moisture in the skin.

**About you:** Han Chinese; combination skin: oily t-zone, rest normal; tan fairly easily, rarely burnt.

**Your opinion:** This is the 2015 reformulation of a very popular sunscreen, with a bump in the PA rating to PA++++. I, unfortunately, have never used the previous reiteration so I can not compare how this one is to the old one, but there's plenty of comparisons online already.

This applies very smoothly and dries quickly. It doesn't dry matte but it's not greasy either. It leaves that fresh dewy look that many people like. I prefer a more matte finish, so I apply a bit of powder on top. As it's a chemical sunscreen, I wait 15 to 20 minutes after application to make sure that it's fully absorbed and ready for whatever I throw at it. It makes a great base for make up; I apply my BB cream over this and it very smoothly blends in.

I will definitely repurchase a few bottles of this as it's the most cosmetically elegant sunscreen I've used!

Disappointed in him but I think coming out after the match for that interview was great.

Defence looked good but Moreno cocked up on that first goal. Also I thought Sakho shouldn't have gone so central for it with Skrtel already in the middle.

None of those are consistent pairings. 

We need to let Poch get his own defenders, Wimmer is one, and mold how they play. He for sure doesn't know his best 4, and neither do we. For all yet he good Rose has done lately, Davies has not done anything wrong either, and in fact, when he has played, has been excellent. Jan has been inconsistent and looked weak in challenges lately whereas we used to see him make a few crunching tackles which now never happen. Dier is young and mistakes will happen, but he has all the qualities to adapt and improve. Walker clearly looks off the pace since coming back. I think he is still looking for some consistency, and up until that run Saturday where he put the ball toward the penalty spot, he hasn't looked up to speed. Yedlin was injured and is for next year, Chiriches is clearly on the out with Kaboul, and Fazio is not a high line player. These defenders don't fit Poch's system.

&gt; I know a lot about Bitcoin.

Sure you do :)

&gt;  I think it's hilarious, and the people who use it and preach it are doubly so.

Yeah, the people that preach its use for everything are hilarious. But I'm not one of those people, I'm just trying to illustrate that Bitcoin can't be regulated.

&gt; So it's very simple to regulate. All you do is make sure that any business in the UK that either swaps Bitcoin for GBP, or swaps GBP for Bitcoin must do the standard 'Know your customer' (KYC) stuff that banks do at the moment.

That is the problem. Neither of those start or end points is definitive. Bitcoins can come into existence from any PC and can be stored on any wallet. The person could just trade the Bitcoin for a product or service without ever transferring it into GBP whatsoever.

&gt; So if someone is putting money into Bitcoin, the government know about it. And if someone is getting money out of Bitcoin, then the government know about it.

Not necessarily. Bitcoins can be traded for products and services (in lieu of fiat currency) and the government would be none the wiser.

&gt; Bitcoins only real use at the moment is the fact that it can be swapped for fiat. So that's the part you regulate.

Bitcoins ""real use"" at the moment is using bitcoins in lieu of fiat. You do not even have to use GBP to buy bitcoins. You can use any currency.

&gt; I'm sorry if this breaks the illusion of Bitcoins omnipotence.

Bitcoins aren't omnipotent, i know you would like to paint me as this crazy guy that thinks they are the destroyer of ""establishment"" but unluckily for you, i am rationale and not prone to these conspiracy theories.

Bitcoins are not particularly useful as of yet, and IMO will never become very useful outside of facilitating criminal activity (blockchain probably will become very useful). But the fact remains they cannot be regulated.

I agree though, the amount I have seen Balotelli defended in here has been surprising. He's obviously troubled and has issues so he doesn't deserve to be targeted by the fans and blamed but he also doesn't deserve some of the adulation he gets, seeing as we have paid £16m for a win against Spurs.

Although I do understand the criticism of Stevie. I don't think I have ever felt that let down by a footballer, like I almost took it personally I felt that bad. Couldn't watch the next five minutes of the match, just pulled my Gerrard top over my head and looked down - I've never reacted like that to a player letting us down before.

1. Scotland doesn't have control over the oil. As shown by Saudi Arabia+ OPEC just fucking everyone up earlier this year by letting the price of oil plummet. That's a key part of an Independent Scotland's revenue already out of their control.

2. Scotland would not be of the EU straight away. This means that they do not benefit from all the money the EU gives out e.t.c. This also puts the currency in to doubt, You wouldn't be part of the Euro, and discussions like that take years, and I mean, years. Scotland wouldn't be fast tracked.

3. Leading from the EU point, the Scottish currency would be cast into doubt, because the only way I can see that Scotland would be allowed to use the pound, is if the rest of the UK agrees, which isn't very likely. The reason for this is that, the rest of the UK would want an actual Scottish independence business as it would affect everyone in the UK. So its only fair.

4. Scotland wouldn't be a part of NATO. Like the EU argument, you would be a new country who would have to go through years of negotiations. You don't get special treatment.

5. Trident. This is linked to NATO. I would expect Trident to stay in Scotland until technology advances so it becomes redundant. Why? Because having a Nuclear deterrent where it is now, its a great way of keeping Russia from taking real liberties. The US would require Nuclear weapons to stay in Britain, and the best place is Scotland.

6. Some of the stuff that the Yes campaign were demanding were absurd. For example wanting part of the British Armed forces. The rUK will want a say in that, and most people in the rUK would say No to giving over parts of the armed forces. 

7. Renegotiation of borders. This is going to be a lengthy and cumbersome process due to the fact that an Independent Scotland and the UK would have no movement deal. So in reality a massive border would have to go up as Scotland would be a great place for anyone who wants to illegally move over unmolested.",null,1,null,1427125557,null,0,false,0,cpo0kpi,null,t3_2zztrc,null,t1_cpo0kpi,null,t1_cpnx7ww,null,null,null,1431966170,null,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0,null

1. Fatigue. Everyone speaks highly about Poch's insane training but he is known for not rotating too. When you consider our squad size some of the players are looking a bit leggy.

2. Leadership. A downside of the ""youngest first XI in the PL"" is that the team lacks maturity in decision making and game management. I'm simply shocked at how little Vertonghen offers by way of leadership.

3. Rotation. Poch doesn't do this v.well at all and needs to learn how to pronto. Walker has returned from a very long term injury and is clearly suffering for form and probably fitness. He should be getting rotated out. Dier has had a really tough period of games - starting from Fiorentina, where is Fazio? Bentaleb and Mason have been played whenever fit - the former went to AFCON the latter has a history of injury troubles, where is Capoue/Stambouli? Is it really necessary for Kane to do the full 90 of every game?

In terms of this weekend, the midfield got bullied by a team of seasoned pro's. Online the analytics community immediately started to discuss how that game under AVB was a classic Paulinho/Dembele/Capoue game with the impetus on controlling the middle against their thugs (as if to press the point home Zenit won on the weekend limiting the opposition to 10 shots 2 on target). It's a tough one. Do you go with a team which is more dynamic aggressive vertically, or go for control which can sometimes look dull? Poch goes attack at all times and I'm not sure whether that is to win over the fans/board in his first season or a genuine disregard for control and game management.
