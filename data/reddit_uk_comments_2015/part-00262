Correct me if I'm wrong, but Lovren claimed that the new chairman and new managers for Southampton no longer fit his aims &amp; ambitions. 24 is a big difference from 20; in ""real life"" terms, we're looking at the difference between a 2nd-year college student and a man looking to being a professional career. I would say 17-25 are hugely formative years for a person.

But here we are with Sterling -- a kid who's been trusted with the maturity to stand tall with giants, and then going ahead to show that he is nothing more than a child with an inflated ego. So far he's done close to nothing that merits a ""bigger deal.""

So in public perception, it's not a captain of a newly promoted side wanting to seek out a bigger challenge... instead, it's a child with an unwarranted sense of entitlement and self-worth, who appears to be failing to see the big picture.

At least, that's the case for me.

Ward has left the agency he worked for and branched off to make his own company. He has Oxlaide Chamberlain on his books and had Berahinho till he decided to part company with Ward.

Of the clients on his roster, Sterling is almost surely the biggest name. It makes a certain, perverse kind of sense that in the scramble to establish himself as a big name agent, he would use the biggest client on his roster to do so.

Of course, if this is how you conduct business as an agent, then it probably doesn't look very attractive so maybe my theory doesn't hold much water but Ward having started his agency in about 2013 14, I'm sure him wanting to make his business plays some part in the Sterling saga.

If the little blond version regenerated into Mels,  then she had to either have stayed a toddler till Rory and Amy were toddlers then start growing, or aged up whatever age she was when the met, then stopped growing, then started again.  Either way she would have have to have spent decades as a child and eluding anyone catching on to her not growing.  Or she had outside help, or has remarkable foresight and/or control over her appearance.  If she had help, there is a story there that we have not seen.

Also, many managers take some time to work out selection in their first season. Van Gaal started the season thinking Jonny Evans would be his best CB. He took a while to determine that his best midfield was Carrick, Herrera and Fellaini. 

Rodgers won't have known how certain players would adapt - he definitely had to change his plans for midfield once he realised Gerrard would have to play in Sahin's position rather than as the #10.

Tube driver that starts training age 18 will be working from age 20. Let's take retirement age as 65, so 65-20 = 45 years of work. 
45*£50,000 = £2.25 million over their career.

Now, for doctors the pay and increases with progression (there is also banding for working unsociable hours, but as this is variable from doctor to doctor, I won't take this into account).

Foundation Year 1 - £22,000
FY2 - £28,000
Registrar - Lowest increment is 31,000, highest is £47,000. Instead of adding up all the increments, I'll just take the average (£39,000) of the lowest and the highest and say that that's the pay for all the years as a registrar. (Also, the amount of years as a registrar varies by speciality, I'll take 6 as the average, but GP is shorter).

£39,000 * 6 = £234,000

At this point, our hypothetical doctor is age 31 (5 years of medical school, 2 foundation years and 6 at registrar, assuming medical school entry age = 18). 65-31 = 34 more years of work as a consultant.

Same as with registrars, I'll take the average of the lowest and highest increment for consultant salary, which is £88,000.

£88,000 * 34 = £2,992,000

So a (very crude) overall life earnings of a doctor = £3,276,000.

So that's a career earnings difference of around £1mill. It's not insignificant, but when you compare the 2 jobs it seems like quite a small number (less than some bankers' bonuses).

Honestly? I regret it. My GCSE and A-level results were the in the top 2-3 of my schools. I could have applied to any university I wanted. Hell, I got FULL MARKS in my A-level English literature exam, I should have studied that! But I didn't. I was adamant I was going to be a filmmaker. 

Three years later I had some amazing memories but a degree that isn't really worth much, and I'd decided I didn't want to be a filmmaker. I wanted a job that was 9-5 and secure. After a couple of months working in a pub in my university town - including taking the train there for each shift after I had moved back home - I found a job back at my old school helping kids with their English and maths. 

I've done this job for three years now. I've even taught mainstream whilst I've been there. But after seriously considering teaching, I've decided against it. The job is too much bureaucracy and paperwork. If it was majority teaching I'd go back and do my post-graduate. But I don't enjoy what a lot of the job is, and I'm worried that I'd lose my evenings and weekends to marking and planning like a lot of my colleagues do. 

So now I'm in the job market again. I'm going into marketing. I've had a few interviews, but compared to the number of roles I've applied for, it's not many.

Read that carefully. Watch the clip again. He said, categorically, that he didn't want to kill the rumour. He's a master at saying one thing and making you think he's said something else entirely, so when you later claim he agreed with you and lied about something, he can tell you you're wrong.

And Child Tax Credit hasn't fallen, it's been frozen. You can argue that it's a real-terms fall, as the cost of living will rise and the benefit remains the same, but in reality it hasn't and won't drop.

You say loyalists were pretty much run by the state when it isn't quite as black and white as that - but let's assume it is and use Pat Finucane as an example (and what a horrific, unjust abuse of the situation by British powers that was) - even a basic knowledge of the Troubles could say the same about the IRA. I mean, if you have informants that are literally sitting on the IRA army council or whatever it's called (which they did), then lines get blurred a lot on that overly simplistic breakdown, and pretending otherwise is part of the dishonesty that's caused reconciliation to be such a one step forward, two steps back kind of game. 

But now tell me this, if the end result is the murder of innocent people, which it was, why support one but not the other? Why is one more admirable than the other? 

What makes the IRA so morally superior to the British? Or vica versa. The answer is nothing. Neither side holds any claim to moral superiority when, at the worst of times, both of them were killing people indiscriminately, or under the flimsiest of pretenses.

It's amazing how strong the ideological assumptions are from some of the people here, probably without most of them even realising it.

From Buying Time: The Delayed Crisis of Democratic Capitalism - Wolfgang Streeck
&gt; 
&gt; The market could be made immune from democratic correctives either through the neoliberal re-education of citizens or through the elimination of democracy on the model of 1970s Chile; the first involves an attempt to indoctrinate the public in standard economic theory, while the second is not available as things stand at present. A strategy to dispel the tension between capitalism and democracy, and to establish the long-term primacy of the market over politics, must therefore centre on incremental ‘reforms’ of political-economic institutions:29 the move towards a rule-bound economic policy, independent central banks and a fiscal policy safe from electoral outcomes; the transfer of economic policy decisions to regulatory bodies and ‘committees of experts’; and debt ceilings enshrined in the constitution that are legally binding on governments for decades to come, if not forever. In the course of this, the states of advanced capitalism are to be constructed in such a way that they earn the enduring trust of the owners and movers of capital, by giving credible guarantees at the level of policy and institutions that they will not intervene in ‘the economy’ – or that, if they do, it will only be to protect and enforce market justice in the shape of suitable returns on capital investments. A precondition for this is the neutralization of democracy, in the sense of the social democracy of postwar capitalism, and the successful completion of a programme of Hayekian liberalization.
&gt; 
&gt; In their rhetoric and ideational policy, the champions of market justice seek to gain the upper hand by denouncing social justice as ‘political’ (in the sense of particularist) and therefore as dirty or corrupt. In contrast, it is claimed that market justice, with its ostensible impersonality and price-theoretical calculability, functions in accordance with universalist principles, in a ‘clean’ manner in the sense of untouched by politics. Such distinctions and equations have long entered deep into everyday language: the statement that something was decided ‘politically’ is often enough to make it appear that the aim was to enrich some defined interest group.30 Capitalist PR experts tirelessly hawk around the view that, whereas markets distribute according to general rules, politics does so with an eye to power and connections. The fact that markets, in assessing efficiency and allocating rewards, disregard the initial endowment that participants bring to them can be ignored more easily than redistributive policies, which must be publicly debated and actively implemented. Also, policy decisions can be attributed to particular individuals or institutions, which can therefore be held accountable for them, whereas market judgements – especially if the market is assumed to be a state of nature – seem to fall from the sky without human intervention and have to be accepted as a fate behind which lurks a higher meaning intelligible only to experts

However, since you are familiar with the basics, and things have moved on a bit since then, you could start at one of the later jumping on points - which many people find more accessible if for no other reason than more modern CGI and an overall bigger budget, so alternatives are:

* The start of series 2 (2006) (well, actually a Christmas special, leading into that season) - with ""The Christmas Invasion"", when we get a new Doctor.  

* The start of series 3 (2007) ""Smith and Jones"" - with a new companion. This is probably not the best starting place, but whatever floats your boat...  

* ""The Runaway Bride"" and then the start of series 4 (2008) ""Partners in Crime"" - with another, and many think the best, new companion.  

* The start of series 5 (2010) ""The Eleventh Hour""  - which is quite deliberately designed as a new jumping on point, new Doctor again.

* The start of series 8 (2014) ""Deep Breath"" - with the current Doctor, Peter Capaldi.

Whereever you do choose to start, I'd suggest going forward from there up to the current point before considering looking at Classic Who which ran from 1963 - 1989, and is very much a change of pace to the modern show.",null,0,null,1436513499,null,0,false,0,csyd9t3,null,t3_3crsyw,null,t1_csyd9t3,null,t3_3crsyw,null,null,null,1437735141,null,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

null,false,Lit-Up,null,null,null,"&gt; You seem to think indiscriminate murder is worse than targeted murder. Why is that?

You're misusing the term 'murder' but if you're a pacifist you probably think all killings in war are murders. That's fine. You can be a pacifist. Don't expect everybody else to be. 

&gt; There are plenty of dead as a result of the IRA killing people indiscriminately.

I'll ask you for the third time - who was the IRA's Lenny Murphy? Who was the IRA's Top Gun? If those counterparts don't exist, explain why they don't exist. 

&gt; If the state was the target, the IRA did a very poor job at it, what with killing all those other people then, didn't they? 

There is still a qualitative and moral difference between killing someone by mistake and intentionally killing them. I'll also call out the total hypocrisy of Irish politicians who use the Easter Rising as some kind of celebratory dawn of national consciousness when over half of those killed during the Rising were civilians. People can't have it both ways, either the IRA are legit or they never were. Condemning the Provos and celebrating the old guys just makes no sense because they have always been essentially the same.

&gt; Let's face it, all sides killed plenty of their own out of sheer incompetence, viciousness and hatefulness.

I would say that most loyalist killings of loyalists were not due to incompetence but internecine drug feuds. I also can't think of any situation where state forces killed themselves through incompetence. I'd hardly characterise the IRA as bumbling fools. Plenty of high risk operations which went exactly to plan, and the targets were always security forces. People use the Shankill bomb as the standard riposte to that. 

&gt; It's quite appalling that you want to try and revise history to remove one side's guilt because of the other side's guilt.

History will always be a subjective recollection and assemblage of so-called facts in a constant state of revision. I mean, look at all this hero worship of Michael Collins, and what's the garden of remembrance in Dublin for? I'd say it's revisionism to revere one group of IRA and vilify another. You may think they were all cunts, but lots of people draw the distinction, although fail to describe it.

&gt; I'll ask you for the third time - who was the IRA's Lenny Murphy? Who was the IRA's Top Gun? If those counterparts don't exist, explain why they don't exist. 

They absolutely do exist, what are you talking about? 

Brian Nelson would be a more apt example, but OK. If we're just going on numbers, Scappaticci is the obvious one (20 years presiding over an internal torture and murder squad should suffice) but of course the reality is the information just isn't public enough to who was working with whom and who killed the most people in the most violent ways. Who knows how many unknown little men got away with all kinds of dirty little things back then. 

Maybe we'll eventually learn more about this as time goes on, but overall there's little point getting into the comparisons game - overall, there was still a ridiculous amount of grotesque violence, torture, murder from both sides, frequently orchestrated at a higher level by the Security forces. 

This leaves us in the unfortunate position where there aren't any more heroes. 

&gt; I'd say it's revisionism to revere one group of IRA and vilify another. You may think they were all cunts, but lots of people draw the distinction, although fail to describe it.

I don't think they were all cunts, I think people are victims of circumstance a lot of the time. I do think some of them were absolutely evil though, and I think it's funny you mention Gerry Kelly as a paragon of virtue. And yes, you might mistake me for a prissy, feeble pacifist for thinking so, but my revulsion over the murders and violence of the Troubles is real. 

I think forgetting the past and filling it with sunshine and bubbles is a great way to repeat it. You don't live here, but at the moment there are wankers setting up crucifixes and threatening catholics, orange lodges are regularly burnt down. A great way to spark the old fire is to lie about the past, or tell half-truths, and that's why you've confused feeble minded pacifism for my annoyance that you'd do that, especially seeing that you aren't actually living here and therefore don't see the reality.

Edit: (sp?) doh 

And to reply on this point: 

&gt; I would say that most loyalist killings of loyalists were not due to incompetence but internecine drug feuds. I also can't think of any situation where state forces killed themselves through incompetence. I'd hardly characterise the IRA as bumbling fools. Plenty of high risk operations which went exactly to plan, and the targets were always security forces. People use the Shankill bomb as the standard riposte to that. 

I need to go through it sentence by sentence. 

&gt; I would say that most loyalist killings of loyalists were not due to incompetence but internecine drug feuds.

I was talking Protestants killing protestants, not loyalists. Plenty of the yabba dabba do any taig will do murders carried out by people like Brian Nelson ended up killing protestants accidentally. These are all documented. 

&gt;  I also can't think of any situation where state forces killed themselves through incompetence. 

There are many examples of state forces killing (or allowing the murder of) informants strategically (to protect other informants.) There's also many examples of the security forces bungling operations that result in needless death. 

[This woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Margaret_Perry) was killed because the IRA man she'd been sleeping with wasn't dealt with properly by his handlers. She knew he was an informer and after their relationship went sour, he said to his handlers that he'd kill her so to as to avoid being found out. They let him do it and she died. This IRA man, and 2 associates, were then subsequently killed by the IRA for being informants after all. The security forces utter ineptitude resulted in four people dying that shouldn't have died. Maybe the three killers are irrelevant, but she wasn't. There are many other examples of similiar fuck ups and choices made to let innocent people die. 

&gt;  I'd hardly characterise the IRA as bumbling fools.

There's a claim that up to one in six IRA men in Derry in the early 70s were informants. The fact that Scappaticci went unfound for so long shows a complete failure on the IRA's part to keep control of itself. 

&gt; Plenty of high risk operations which went exactly to plan, and the targets were always security forces. People use the Shankill bomb as the standard riposte to that. 

Or that time they bombed the hotel beside my school. Or that time they made all those people disappeared. Or any of other tit for tat murders they engaged in. To say it was ""always security forces"" targets is just utter bollix.

Invest in some of the [recommended reading from the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/wiki/recommendedreading). Additionally consider picking up Nudge by Sunstein and Thaler, and Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. They both have sections on what is referred to as ""reckless caution"" - the concept that by turning down *some* risk, people end up with far worse outcomes in the long-run.

&gt; I'm 36, and higher rate taxpayer. I have a PAYE 9-5 which pays around £50k and a second income from a business that I run that is now a Ltd Co that generates another c. £30-£40k of income that I take as dividends.

Talk to your accountant about the effects of the new dividend taxes - you may want to reconsider how you draw the income.

&gt; I also have around £100k in cash savings at the moment, and house that has £800k of equity with around £50k outstanding of an offset mortgage.

Is the cash offsetting the mortgage to £0? If not, it seems like an obvious choice.

&gt; I have no pension and until yesterday was planning in investing in student BTLs which I was planning on using as a long term investment for a retirement income and then passing on to my kids. With the budget change that doesn't seem to be worthwhile now as a higher rate taxpayer?

Student BTLs do not fit a ""low risk"" approach. They're highly speculative, high-yield property investment, with potential for plenty to go wrong. Concentration risk, liquidity risk, default risk, political risk, poor tax treatment, etc. etc.

&gt; Briefly looking around at other investments the returns at the moment seem to be so small, ISAs are &lt;2%, I have no idea about pensions, so I guess I should educate myself there. I know my day job is introducing a workplace pension at some point that I could max out for a couple of years, but realistically how much do I need to have in there?

Cash ISAs aren't investments in the sense that you're looking at. There is a distinction between cash deposits (which Cash ISAs fall into) and long-term investments (property, stocks &amp; shares, etc.)

&gt; Is it worth waiting for the workplace pension to come in, or am I better-off looking elsewhere? Can I put £100k straight into a pension now? Would there be any point doing that?

Definitely join workplace pension when it starts. You can't put £100k into a pension because there is an ""annual allowance"" of £40k PA. There are provisions for ""carrying forward"" previous allowances, but you must have been a member of a pension scheme in the year you're carrying forward from. Unless you have old deferred pensions you're effectively limited to £40k.

&gt; I'm also wondering about P2P lending. The returns seem higher than and ISA, but the risks are greater, and then I guess I would be taxed as 40% on the interest right?

You are correct on both points.

&gt; Getting taxed at 40% on any investments seem to make anything other than a pension pointless?

With stocks &amp; shares investments you will only be taxed at 40% on any fixed-interest income. The dividend income will be taxed in the same way as your company dividends, and capital growth is only taxed on sale of assets. Not only this, but you can use ""stocks &amp; shares ISAs"", with a £15,000 PA allowance, to invest tax-free. The contributions have to come out of taxed income, but any growth within the ISA wrapper is tax free and any income taken out is also tax-free.

&gt; So other than giving advice, which I guess will (correctly) be go and see an IFA, I'm asking what would you do if you were in my position, where would you look to invest that is going to give me my best chance of capital growth. Are there any more unusual investments that can offer capital growth that are tax efficient?

You need a combined approach of pensions (particularly making use of company contributions from your ltd company) and stocks &amp; shares ISAs, with the balance of any long-term investments being outside the ISA wrappers but still fairly tax-efficient. A decent IFA (preferably chartered - you can filter at www.unbiased.co.uk) will steer you in the right direction for a fee. If you want to do things yourself be prepared to invest your time into a lot of learning. Doing nothing will be much more expensive in the long-run than seeing an IFA, however.

Flying a flag from your own property is fine , you could argue this but pointless at present , lets allow that for now.

Flying a flag from lampposts or NIHE communal buildings is not fine , if you live in the area then its the DRD and NIHE who have legislation that allows you to live in the area free from intimidation etc etc etc.

What you will find is that if you get legal advice and confront the DRD and NIHE with legal threat they actually do something about it.

They both have a duty of care to the people of the areas they represent and if you highlight that you are being affected by their failings in their duty to you then you have a right to raise the matter legally.

Painting kerbstones etc is criminal damage 
Bonfires etc that cause damage to property then start legal action , make your concerns to the council , ask for a risk assessment , ask who is ultimately responsibly within the department  , get help from the moderate politicians , go to the media and when your property is damaged , children afraid etc etc , document it and start legal action.

Haven't worn a watch for years, probably a decade; having something on my wrist again is weird. It lasts about a week without charging which is fine. It's more of an extension of my phone really, and is a different output for data I already have.

I'm using Misfit for pedometer/sleeptracker... but I'm not sure how accurate they really are aside from highlighting extremes. For example, I've walked from my bed to my desk today which according to my watch is well over a thousand steps. I'm certainly fitter than I thought.

Regarding sleep, I'm probably in bed for 8-9 hours a day... but my watch says I only spend about an average of 5 sleeping. Ladies, my comment box is open.

Now, it'd be easy to combine the two above points, but I'm right handed and Pebble Times are designed to go on the left wrist.

I am finding it useful for telling the time, the date and the day with a glance. No more fumbling in my pocket. Also good for controlling music and seeing what's playing without... fumbling in my pocket. It has a pretty cool transport app which locates the nearest train station and gives up to date departure times including when trains are late. I find this really useful. Saves... fumbling in my pocket.

It has a compass, news and twitter apps at present. It also shows any texts or callers, emails I receive or even Skype messages I get. All of which mean I can get information at a glance without getting my phone out.

In conclusion, you own a device that does all of these things already. The watches make it more convenient, but they're not a necessity.

I know the research, but I also know the reality and I wouldn't count washing someone's mouth out or a short smack in extreme cases as the same as daily beatings. 

I worked with an African lady who was convinced that the problem with a lot of second/third generation kids was that they aren't allowed to smack and they don't know how to parent without it (she was smacked by her first generation mum).

Correct, families are. You've misunderstood or deliberately misconstrued what I was saying.

&gt; It is an abuse of and a burden on the benefits system to keep having kids when you can't afford them without benefits.

Only it's not, really. I just posted the figures somewhere else: The cap equals  £1.3bn savings over three years. In the grand scheme of things, that's not going to help bring down a £1.5tn deficit one little bit. Considering that there's hardly any reason, in a strengthening economy to *still* stick to the £12bn target, if something could have been left by the wayside, it's this. I could be wrong, but I believe it amounts to the smallest saving of all of his changes.

I believe Osborne sees a country where everyone's first thought to problems, particularly money problems, is ""the Government should be doing something about this"". He sees a country where people believe that Government support for their lifestyle choices should be unquestioningly given.

Take the child tax credit limit to 2 children, for example. I think Osborne's rationale is ""it's not the Government's job to help you afford that many children"".

I see the same thing in the slashing of tax credits and the raise in minimum wage. I'm *certain* Osborne knew there would be losers to that policy, he knew there would be winners too. To me, his motivation is clear: ""it's no longer the Government's job to make your ends meet"" goes through the Chancellor's head as he made this statement. 

David Cameron's ""Big Society"" and now George Osborne's ""New Contract"" are social engineering to forge the type of society the Conservatives want to see. They want a Britain where people rely on themselves first, ""big society"" second, and the Government third. People say food banks are a bad side effect of Cameron's ministry: I say they've always been intentional. I think the Conservatives *want* the poor to go to charities before the Government steps in.

All in all I disagree that the theme is hard to discern: I believe the theme from 2010 onwards has been all too obvious. The ""grand plan"" is to build a society in which they see the Government being small and rarely heard from or spoken to, where people's lifestyle choices are theirs to make but also theirs to finance, and where Government support, where given, is very basic and minimal.

You should not have to feel intimidated in your own home.
Start asking questions as to who is ultimately responsible within each department and then get local politicians to ask them why  they are failing in their duty of care to you? and why they are not following their own guidelines on anti social behaviour , flags and intimidation.

Summer I imagine sunning myself and sitting on beaches, enjoying a bbq in the evening. Instead I am on a bus so hot I have to actually get off and walk, or it rains and it is too warm for a coat. 

Currently I am looking forward to autumn, skipping along in some woods, watching the leaves fall and collecting conkers.

That's the key. Most of the time, if you know what you're doing, you don't need to hit your kids. 

And if you don't know what you're doing, hitting your kids usually doesn't help. Most children want attention, and if positive attention isn't available, negative attention is a useful substitute. Ignoring your kids most of the time, but giving them a slap when they cross a boundary, isn't going to work.

please prove that to me... they have been 'triple locked' so far as I know.  The only area I can think of that pensioners have been hit are their savings as interest so low (and this will not effect poor ones).  

&gt; Most pensioners are not rich. Most seem to be dirt poor.

again, no.  Some are but the point made is their pensions have not been lowered at all.  Keep in mind this is the last generation that will get back more than they put in.  

&gt; Coalition/Tories raised the pension age

was it?  http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-1679780/New-state-pension-age-retire.html

&gt; They're also reducing tax free pension contributions for the highest earners

not really worried about them tbh

&gt; They also announced higher taxes on people cashing in pensions

I read they are increasing the tax on contrition's, not cashing out.  Tories made it very easy to cash out (not a good idea)

&gt; So it's not like pensioners have escaped entirely. And the richest pensioners were definitely targeted.

again, not worried about richest and the non-rich seem to be locked in too... share source if I am wrong!

I held out for ages before getting one.  I just didn't see the point; I've got a desktop PC for sitting-at-my-desk web surfing and gaming and (had) an old IBM Laptop that I used for reading in bed  and casual surfing in front of the TV etc.  

Then the TP finally gave up the ghost and was faced with the choice of either spending a lot of money on a laptop or a lot less on a cheap tablet.  Since 90% of what I was using the laptop for I could do on a tablet and I was also skint I opted for the cheap £90 tablet that lasted until my kids bought me a Hudl2 for xmas last year.

I can't say I miss the laptop.  The tablet is smaller, lighter and much more convenient.  I can drop it in the glove box for when I'm sat in the car waiting for various children to finish work/college, a £1 tablet stand in the kitchen keeps it propped up for when I'm trying a new recipe or listening to an audiobook whilst cooking,  the battery lasts long enough for me to read a book or browse the net for four or five hours, I don't need a laptop cooler to use it in bed and a 'night clock' app means it doubles as a bedside alarm clock whilst not in use.

null,false,MarcusOrlyius,null,null,null,"[For future reference, a lot of surnames are actually taken from the professions.](http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Goldsmith)

&gt;This interesting and unusual surname is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and is from an occupational name for a worker in gold, derived from a compound of the Olde English pre 7th Century ""gold"", similar to the Old High German ""gold"", and the Middle English (1200 - 1500) ""smith"", from the Olde English ""smith"", a smith, probably a derivative of ""smitan"", to strike, hammer. To a large extent it is an Anglicized form of the German ""Goldschmid(t)"". Metal-working was one of the earliest occupations for which specialist skills were required, and its importance ensured that these terms and their cognomens and equivalents were perhaps the most widespread of all occupational surnames in Europe. The surname was first recorded in the mid 13th Century, and early recordings of the surname include: Thomas Goldsmith, witness in the 1255 Assize Rolls of Essex; and John le Goldesmethe in the 1309 ""Calendar of Letter Books of Devonshire"". Probably the best known namebearer was Oliver Goldsmith (1728 - 1774), the Irish poet, dramatist and novelist, whose works include the novel ""The Vicar of Wakefield"" (1766), the poem ""The Deserted Village"" (1770), and the comedy ""She Stoops to Conquer"" (1773). A Coat of Arms granted to a Goldsmith family in Hampshire is a red shield, a chevron silver three crosses crosslet black on a chief gold, a lion passant red, the Crest being a stork black bezantee. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Roger Goldsmiz, which was dated 1250, in the ""Middle English Surnames of Occupation"", Norfolk, during the reign of King Henry 111, known as ""The Frenchman"", 1216 - 1272. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to ""develop"" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.

There were some games, namely WBA and Newcastle at home and Man City away, where Poch's stubborn tactical approach really cost us. It's not just about formations or subs, though I feel that he should start doing some earlier, but rather he approaches almost every game similarly. 

I'd personally would like to see him play a pure DM to give more room for the other CM to move ahead and make something happen. And also use traditional wingers, using pace to beat the fullback and cross from the byline. Just play wider in general to stretch the opponent defense across the pitch.

From a worldwide perspective much honour killing in Latin America and India often have very little to do with Islam. But if we were to generalise; honour violence comes from micro cultures of local societies rather than organised religions.  I don't have any specific links readily at hand, but if you're interested I suggest you start looking into biographies and individual stories of the people surrounding the incidents that have happened - there's often very insightful ideas about culture and religion prevalent. In terms of the UK Diana Nammi have been quoted saying about [two thirds of honour violence in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing#United_Kingdom) are amongst different Muslim populations, a majority yes but 1 third in the UK is still a large proportion. Globally the stats are even more varied. The initial response I replied to seemed like an uninformed knee-jerk reaction I just felt the need to clarify.

The sign itself is unpleasant and nasty but not illegal - but winding up a crowd is likely to get you arrested to prevent a breach of the peace.

I would say that holding such a sign would be a criminal offence under the Public Order Act.  A person commits an offence under section 4A if he ""displays [...] a sign [...] which is threatening or abusive"" with intent to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress.

A ""God Hates Fags"" sign is obviously abusive, and intent to cause distress can be inferred from the fact that the person has chosen to display it at a Pride march.

 Basically the unions want higher wages for working nights, regardless of how they're playing it. That's what they're after.

Wait a sec.

de Menezes was restrained by the plain clothes officer who had followed him, who was pulled off him by the armed cops so they could shoot him 7 times in the head.

null,false,nicolasbrody,null,null,null,"Intriguing, I started off more against Greece (due to awareness of corruption) but for starters, the tax issues you talk about have been happening for ages, Greece was doing quite well, then it joined the EU and the euro and suddenly, things got much worse.

Then, they were given a bailout, with harsh austerity conditions attached, and things got even worse. Like I said, these bailouts are not designed to help Greece, they exist to protect the banks, though it's silly because, Greece cannot pay back. You can't collect tax revenue and sort out your other problems, if you have an unsustainable amount of debt and if your country is bankrupt. 

I'm unconvinced that Greece, especially under this government, refuses to live within it's means. Not sure where Syriza have said that. 

Again, Greece can't do anything if it's people are starving, unemployed and if it's out of money. The creditors are simple offering them money with similarly harsh austerity measures attached, which made things worse in the first place, and without any real debt relief. 

The tax payer of Europe has a very simple justification for a bailout - citizens of another country are starving, in poverty, many have committed suicide, and the country is broke. I repeat again - previous bailouts have simply paid off interest and those who did the bailout, very little of the money has actually gone to Greece. So taxpayers have been bailing out the bankers, again! Reckless lending is equally as bad as reckless borrowing, yet people seem to forget this.

null,false,PiggySoup,null,null,null,"When I went to Uni, around 3 years ago. I got the bare minimum. At it's highest roughly £1,100 for each semester. In my first year of Uni, I got even less, around £900 per semester. Zero grants, everything repayable. 

To those who don't know, what you get for funds is determined entirely on how much your parents make and any disabilities which you or your dependencies may have. 

My parents are not rich, their income lands on the cusp of 'too much' and 'not enough'. Basically what I'm saying here is, I've done University and I've done it with the bare minimum support this Government will provide. I've had to deal with the anger of every single one of my friends being handed £900 grants in mid terms and I'm given literally nothing. I had to deal with £900 for 5 months when I had classmates who (had single/disabled parents) were receiving upwards of £2,200 each and every semester, not to mention the multiple grants which are handed out with zero repayment. 

How exactly is that fair? Just because **your parents** make over X amount, does not necessarily mean that **their** money **they** earn rolls down into your pockets. That may be the case for families with 6 figure incomes, but not for the hundreds of thousands of middles class families whose income lands on the cusp of a cut-off figure... They may have slightly more money than minimum wage paid jobs, but that does not make them millionaires with money to burn. It's extremely unfair. All students should be viewed as equal, how is it fair to allow less financial stress on X amount of students (those available for grants) and not with students who aren't applicable for grants? This increases the likelihood of those students dropping out due to financial stress.. Or to pick up a few part-time jobs to help pay your way. Nothing wrong with that right? Oh expect it eats into your study time and leaves you with yet another disadvantage that grant receivers don't have to worry about. Funny that isn't it. The majority of grant receivers will come from homes with no working family members, and it's because of those unemployed family members that these kids don't need to get their own job to put themselves through uni. Just get even more handouts like their dead beat parents. 

Meanwhile my parents have worked their entire life on the cusp of an income bracket. Too much for a handout, not enough to spoil anyone. Just enough to get told no for every single form of support. My brother, sister and I would have had a much easier educational life if my parents never bothered getting decent jobs.

tl;dr 

I did uni with no grants and the bare minimum support, it's extremely unfair/infuriating that some students and not all are being given additional support with no repayment options. I'm glad the grants are being scrapped. Make it available for every single student or none at all.

Disclaimer: The below figures could well be wrong. I am not an accountant and therefore do not regularly undertake these calculations. DYOR and YMMV.

The main reasons for the difference are: no need to consider gross dividend anymore (meaning less in the higher rate tax band), higher personal allowance and higher rate allowance, and the £5,000 div allowance. 

For these reasons the tax will bite harder the further into the higher rate band you get.

Where Isco and Illarramendi were the stars of the Spainish team, and it was the first time really that people outside of Spain became aware of his unique and impressive talent. He played as a defensive midfielder, their water-carrier, whatever you may call them - but to think of him as a simple anchor for their midfield would be doing him a huge injustice. Illarramendi is simply a thoroughly modern footballer, an all-round athlete with an engine of a long distance runner.


Mikel Aranburu’s retirement from Sociedad meant that Illarramendi was immediately expected to step up into his role in his final season. His industrious work rate means he shuts down any leaks in the midfield to prevent advances from the opposing play makers, while also being able to regain and retain possession due to his exceptional tackling and interception. This is a role that we've calling out for ever since Lucas had his long-term injury, and now could be perfect time to pounce. Illarramendi is a very good passer of the ball, can tackle and as said has a great engine - but it is his reading of the game which makes him such a natural footballer.


His passing and tackling are his main attributes, added on to his incredible (and excuse me for saying) but sometimes Alonso-esque vision from deep. He will win the ball back for your team with grit and effort, and then effortlessly make sure his team keeps it with simple understanding of the game and vision.
 

Put simply, him in a midfield with either Henderson, Milner or Can will have enough running and ball retention within it to dominate most midfields.


I cannot stress enough how highly I rate Asier, if we signed him, I think all those that don't know that much about him will be left in shock at how good he really is.

(a)if at the time of the act or acts alleged to constitute the offence he believed that the person or persons whom he believed to be entitled to consent to the destruction of or damage to the property in question had so consented, or would have so consented to it if he or they had known of the destruction or damage and its circumstances; or

(b)if he destroyed or damaged or threatened to destroy or damage the property in question or, in the case of a charge of an offence under section 3 above, intended to use or cause or permit the use of something to destroy or damage it, in order to protect property belonging to himself or another or a right or interest in property which was or which he believed to be vested in himself or another, and at the time of the act or acts alleged to constitute the offence he believed—

(i)that the property, right or interest was in immediate need of protection; and

(ii)that the means of protection adopted or proposed to be adopted were or would be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.

Audio drama is certainly a very different format from the TV series, but Big Finish has done truly exceptional work with the license over the years. They've made excellent use of the Doctors and companions who weren't as well-served by the show during their time (Six and Eight are especially given the opportunity to shine, and believe it or not, Peri and Mel are both EXCELLENT companions when written by BF stalwarts), and they've also proven that some of the shorter-lived incarnations of popular villains deserved much more than they were offered.

Terry Molloy played Davros on TV in three stories, if I remember correctly, during the Five, Six, and Seven eras. But it's in audio that he made the role his own; it's thanks to his appearances in Big Finish stories that I think of him as the definitive Davros. Similarly, Geoffrey Beevers only played the Master once on TV, in *The Keeper of Traken*, but in the audios he's become one of my favorite incarnations of our evil friend, haha.

In short, they do great work, especially when it involves classically less-beloved or under-appreciated cast members. *Davros* is an excellent showcase for both Colin Baker and Molloy, and I think if it was a TV story it'd be regarded as one of the all-time classics.

Ideally yes, but people who go to uni aren't normal. The demographic is skewed by people from higher-income backgrounds. The number of people I know from uni who have been on gap yahs, grew up with family skiiing holidays, own more than one suit, got given a car for their 18th birthday etc. is higher in proportion than the number of people I know from home with that kind of background. Students have technically left home, but they're still very much in receipt of support from home. I guess the grants are there to level the playing field a bit. 

I think in order to give everybody the same grant/loan money you would have to make it large enough to cover living expenses through the whole year, not just term time (current minimum loans are barely enough to cover accommodation for 3/4 of the year), and I suspect it would be quite expensive to give everyone on average more money (and would mean reducing the funds of those with more money currently to balance it out).",null,0,null,1436528274,null,0,false,0,csygxcb,null,t3_3co3fk,null,t1_csygxcb,null,t1_csxrp3j,null,null,null,1437737893,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;The employment effect of the minimum wage is one of the most studied topics in all of economics.
This report examines the most recent wave of this research – roughly since 2000 – to determine the
best current estimates of the impact of increases in the minimum wage on the employment
prospects of low-wage workers. The weight of that evidence points to little or no employment
response to modest increases in the minimum wage.

&gt; The report reviews evidence on eleven possible adjustments to minimum-wage increases that may
help to explain why the measured employment effects are so consistently small. The strongest
evidence suggests that the most important channels of adjustment are: reductions in labor turnover;
improvements in organizational efficiency; reductions in wages of higher earners (""wage
compression""); and small price increases.

&gt;Given the relatively small cost to employers of modest increases in the minimum wage, these
adjustment mechanisms appear to be more than sufficient to avoid employment losses, even for
employers with a large share of low-wage workers.

There are management issues with bonfires, who is organising them and how they are managed, in comparison to say the 12th you know who's organising it and who is in charge, if there is issues you know who to go to and they will be working with the police and other bodies well in advance of the event. For bonfires this isn't always the case, and if there is no record of who is in charge there's no record of who is liable. And there's little reason why anyone would want to come forward because of the liability issues.

Councils in some areas do encourage these committees to come out into the open, with grants, and you can't get a grant unless you meet certain requirements and have someone to put their name to it. This isn't a long term solution monetarily speaking but it does influence the culture of it. 

There is a culture of making your bonfire bigger and better than the one up the road and if you get stuck into this competition what was a suitable position for a small to medium sized bonfire isn't suitable for the monolith that has arrived.

There are legal issues with all of this health and safety for a start so bringing in more legislation may be superfluous but a code of practice should be compiled that details the relevant laws that do apply. 

Changes are happening across the board, Newry for example has only had a beacon for this past number of years and have shifted the focus to other aspects of the night. I'm not aware of there ever being a bonfire in Bessbrook.

null,false,TrickyDickNixonbot,,Michael Foot 2: Jeremy Corbyn Boogaloo,null,"&gt; I never said Marx was 100% correct. You have to recognise the factors that led to the crash, and admit that volume one does a good job of explaining them. Capital was very popular on Wall Street after the crash, not because traders suddenly became Socialists, but because they recognised it might not be advisable to discount it out of hand. I wouldn't describe myself as a Marxist, but I'm not so arrogant as to ignore such a comprehensive critique of the utopian market ideals that underpin our current political settlement.

Lmao, no. Das Kapital is filled with outdated economic premises, and everything in it that still stands has been said by someone else and does not predicate Marx's own theories in any notable manner. The novelty of Das Kapital has increased recently, but it in no way accurately described, predicted or explained the 2008 crash well *at all*, to claim so is laughably delusional. I will discount out of hand, because its ideas and proposals unilaterally failed after slaughtering millions upon millions of innocent people, and, as I said above, most of Marx's fundamental theories like labour theory of value and tendencies in accumulation of capital have been factually proven completely wrong. 

&gt; This is the problem, it's too fucking easy to discount people as mad out of touch lefties, and associate them with the aberrations of the 20th century, and just blindly accept that the way things work at the moment is the only way.

We're discounting you because to pretend Marx is relevant is dumb and will get you laughed out of any place of economic academia immediately. Discussing Marx in philosophical and sociological circles is mostly limited to his historic contributions, and its widely acknowledged that his theories hold little weight today and have largely been demonstrated as false or misdirected. The problem here is you assume that its Marxism vs. Capitalism, totally ignoring the tens of hundreds of subschools of Capitalism. Accepting that Capitalism and the market economy works is not unilaterially accepting everything anyone has done in the past 30 years in the field of economic policy, that's idiotic. 

Im sorry but no amount of kicking and screaming is going to make Marx relevant again, he is unilaterally irrelevant to all but college yuppies and pseudo-intellectuals, and picking up his tomes once more spells death for the Labour Party, both in intellectual integrity and at the ballot box.

Incorrect. Nothing **YOU** do will stop that. But if *we* (as a population) wanted to bring an end to it then we could. 

But fact is, most people don't care enough to do such a thing which is a shame. People's doors aren't being kicked down in raids, people aren't getting arrested for minor infractions and people aren't getting sent away to rehabilitation camps ala 1984 due to the GCHQ. People are currently comfortable and want to keep it that way. It's a shame more people don't get actively involved in politics beyond voting (and even then the response is lackluster) but it's just the way it is.

Yep, he's had loan spells already. I really like Evans but I don't know if the club is convinced on him enough yet to give him a go with the first team. When he came back after his Scunthorpe loan spell he played for the EDS, but at centre-back and he struggled tbh. He's not a CB, clearly. However whenever he's had brief friendly appearances for the first team in his usual CM position he's looked pretty good. That 50 yard assist in the friendly v Hamburg mid-season was spectacular, and then his goal against Toronto post-season....well. It was great. Yaya would have been proud.

Stylistically he's a little Carrick-esque. Not too unlike Huws in that regard. I wouldn't really say he's aggressive, or even exciting. His game is all about composure and ticking the game over. He's very good at it too, and I tend to subscribe to the theory that some players improve greatly, almost unrecognisably so, when surrounded by more talented players. Not all obviously, but some do, and I reckon Evans could be one of them. He's an intelligent lad and he must love playing alongside Yaya etc compared to whoever he played alongside at Scunny. 

Fofana's the opposite. Aggression, power and brute force while lacking composure. A mixture of the two would be great, as Evans is more naturally composed i think. I'd really like it if the club gave him a go as he could rise to the challenge, especially given that hes a blue. Chances are he might move out again on loan though. I don't think the club has passed on him just yet though.

They got you. While it's obvious that any increase in the minimum wage is a step forward for reducing inequality, the fact that it's been called a 'living wage' is cheap and dishonest. £7.20 an hour falls short of the actual living wage (calculated by the [Living Wage Foundation](http://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation)) even outside of London, and within it is even further from enough. Furthermore, the £7.80/£9.15 figures you'll see on the Foundation's website account for the tax credits that you celebrated the removal of (and rightly so! if employers paid a true living wage to begin with they wouldn't be necessary). I've seen a couple of figures thus far modifying the LWF's calculations for the loss of tax credits, and the most damning place the London Living Wage above £12.

Sounds like it was just a way to control food over the 14 years rationing took place even if they had enough eggs

&gt;To make the British weak, the Germans tried to cut off supplies of food and other goods. German submarines attacked many of the ships that brought food to Britain. 

&gt;Before the war, Britain imported 55 million tons of food, a month after the war had started this figure had dropped to 12 million.
...
&gt;To make sure that everybody got a fair share of the food available.

&gt;The government was worried that as food and other items became scarcer, prices would rise and poorer people might not be able to afford things. There was also a danger that some people might hoard items, leaving none for others


&gt;Some people considered food rationing to be very unfair. Eggs, butter and meat could be obtained fairly easily without coupons in rural areas. 

&gt;By the summer of 1941 greengrocers in the towns were taking their lorries into the country to buy vegetables direct from growers.

The Tory doublespeak is unreal, they say they're the party for hardworking people then introduce policies that negatively effect hard working people. They say they're about the environment while introducing policies that are bad for the environment and selling off state owned environmental companies. They say the economies doing great while productivity isn't moving and real wages haven't grown. They say they have a ""“long-term economic plan” when all of their policies are for short term gain. Cameron boasted about child poverty not being as bad as people thought, when actually he changed the definition to avoid embarrassment. 

You could go on and on with this, there's doublespeak in all of their policies. 

They get away with outright lying in PMQs and calling their biased statistics ""facts"", if they get called out on something they're uncomfortable with they get one of their MPs stands up with a planted question ""does the prime minister agree that X shows that our long-term economic plan is working?""




And the worst part is none of this is seen by most of their voterbase, because it simply isn't reported in the DM/Sun/Telegraph where they get their news. In those papers Osborne is doing a great job, it's the benefit claimants, single mothers &amp; immigrants that you need to watch.

The criticism Osborne gets from hoards of economists &amp; academics is completely ignored, it will all come to light when he's gone, people will realise how dumb they were falling for this shit.

I once called them to ask when a light was being replaced as it was broken and got met with an insult calling me a 'stupid student'. They also do monthly house inspections and expect the place to be like a hotel room with any stuff which ordinarily would be fine lying out, they expect packed away.

I also find their properties very superficial. I.e their paint is super thin and yet they will charge you for any marks left. The walls are paper thin with the most minimal amount of plaster used. 
Most of all, they just treat their clients like children whilst they are the parents and I don't believe that is how it should be. 

Again, I have only experienced student lettings and I would expect their professional branch to be much more...professional.

As to the quality of education, the face to face teaching time doesn't necessarily have to drop. As the move is made away from short duration courses to longer courses, would the number of teaching staff required not drop disproportionately - you can provide the teaching for ten students doing longer full-time courses with fewer teachers than if you were providing the same number of teaching hours for the equivalent number of students doing 10 hour courses. Funding is given out based on the number of Weighted Standard Units of Measurement (WSUM) not on the number of enrollments. WSUM have only dropped by 3% over the last seven years. So there is a bit of disconnect between the cuts claimed in your articles and what the SFC is saying it is funding. Perhaps the rate at which WSUM's are funded has changed.

Needs further investigation.

&gt;In psychology, cognitive dissonance is **the mental stress or discomfort** experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance

&gt;**psychological conflict** resulting from incongruous beliefs and attitudes held simultaneously

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cognitive%20dissonance

&gt;**anxiety that results** from simultaneously holding contradictory or otherwise incompatible attitudes, beliefs, or the like, as when one likes a person but disapproves strongly of one of his or her habits.

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cognitive+dissonance

&gt;**The psychological tension** that occurs when one holds mutually exclusive beliefs or attitudes and that often motivates people to modify their thoughts or behaviors in order to reduce the tension.

http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cognitive+dissonance

The whoscored thing was just the first thing I found on google and it's the season before last, which is why Lacazette isn't featured more prominently. Firmino is a HUGE signing nonetheless. Man Utd were interested and so were other clubs, but for various reasons (too many players in that position, cost, wages, other targets etc.) they didn't pull the trigger on him and we did. And we got it done quick.

Lacazette is a different proposition too, I realise this. He will more than likely be pursued by some big clubs. But who really needs a striker? Barca and Real Marid don't. Athletico don't, and probably couldn't afford him. Can't see him going to an Italian club. Man Utd maybe, but they just signed Depay and they play one up front and already have Rooney. Will they pay around 40m for a backup striker? Arsenal definitely need a striker but will they pay the money? Maybe. Bayern and PSG are also possibilities. PSG particularly.

Then there's Lacazette himself, he want's to play and establish himself in the France team for the European Championships. So he want's a club that will play him every game. That is us. That is what we can offer him that the other teams can't. Here, he would be the focal point of the team and maybe he's a man of taste and just likes Liverpool better than other options. Who knows?

So, I'm not saying we're absolutely, 100%, positively, definitely going to get Lacazette. Just that there is a chance, albeit a small one. In a thread on here at the end of the season I said I wanted Clyne and Firmino to come in and I was down voted to hell and told no chance whatsoever. Well now they're leaning.

Assuming the road designs stay as they are, it does not make sense to apply vehicular rules to cyclists, and it makes more sense most of the time to pass a red light.

More often than not, it would be safe for me to jump a red. When there no pedestrians and there is no obstructive traffic, or traffic has been stopped at a red. In these situations it is just as safe to jump a red as it is to wait for a green, if not safer. This is a simple fact.

But those jumping a red light do so at their own peril - that's just part of the game.

Sure, there are those incompetent few who will fuck it up, but they're likely to be the ones who fuck up in other ways, whether following the rules or not. 

Those of us responsible and competent enough to navigate safely through a red light without posing a danger to pedestrians or other road users should be free to do so, the pros outweigh the cons by a big margin.

Absolutely nothing.  For some reason the powers-that-be don't seem particularly bothered by HTTPS, but they tell specific scare stories about end-to-end encryption apps.  Unless it's some double-bluff of course.

HTTPS isn't much protection against a nation-state adversary, GCHQ have stolen private keys to certificate authorities before now, a fake certificate is meat-and-drink to them.  Quite what the government proposes for mass-surveillance I don't know; the most recent attempt (the 2012 Communications Data Bill) and the previous one under Labour put the responsibility in the hands of ISPs, Labour specifically talked about installing ""black boxes from GCHQ"", that heavily implies they're planning on MITM everything...

But that wouldn't help with end-to-end encryption, that just reveals one layer; the second layer is encrypted with a key that only exists on the handset of the receiver, who may well be in a different country.

&gt; Do you have a source on banks providing data to the government willy nilly?

I didn't say willy-nilly, they'll do what they have to under the law.  No more, no less.  They currently do provide pro-active information under various anti-money laundering schemes; they'll also provide a full statement-of-account if a request comes from the right source with the right paperwork.  If a future act of parliament made them hand-over each transaction then that's what they'll do; that will be a lot easier, and more accurate, than forcing every transaction out in the open where it can be passively snooped.

&gt; If anything I thought problem with the banks is that they're too secretive giving room for massive abuses of the assets their controlling.

That's true of some foreign banks, not of UK ones.  I don't think banks are much of a target under these current proposals either way, it's mostly about who's talking to who.

&gt; While people won't go out and install it on jailbroken phones etc, this still doesn't explain what businesses will be doing about their own data that they don't want compromised. What will they do in this situation?

What can they do?  They have to operate under the law.  I doubt (many) care that much, I'm sure they'll happily become compliant; the only businesses who'll struggle would be those who can't offer secure services outside the UK; a US business might be reluctant (and quite right too) to use a UK based service.  The operations of a business would be vulnerable if the government did something really stupid like ban SSH.  If they went that far (and they haven't said that they would), then every UK based company with an internet presence would be hacked within hours.",null,0,null,1436537951,null,0,false,0,csyl094,null,t3_3cs5wf,null,t1_csyl094,null,t1_csyipc0,null,null,null,1437740932,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

That doesn't contradict what I said.

2. In an official capacity, it'll be referred to by whatever the naming rights stipulate. In an informal capacity, I highly expect we'll still call it White Hart Lane. It may be that a deal could be arranged like that with The Oval cricket ground which keeps the Oval name but with an sponsor attached (e.g. The Kia Oval) - AIA White Hart Lane, Sainsbury's White Hart Lane etc etc

3. I'm not really fussed, given everyone will still be free to call it whatever they want. The naming rights will help pay for stuff. We can still say White Hart Lane.

Well, it's tough isn't it? People have to have the right to defend themselves.

OTOH, it's telling how you frame your thoughts.  Critics of TH are 'thugs'.  

Perhaps we could all do with a bit less certainty and self-righteousness.  Like you, I didn't agree with the critics, but I think we should allow that people should have the right to their opinions.  If someone honestly and sincerely thinks that Hunts' remarks are damaging women in science, then they should have the right to say so.

But, I hear you protest, they maliciously framed Hunt and deliberately misquoted him!  

Perhaps and perhaps not.  I think that it's impossible to know for sure what his critics' intentions were.  They may have been absolutely sincere, or they may have been malicious.  I don't think we have enough information to condemn them and even if we did, I still wouldn't think it's right to mercilessly hound them in social media.

Did they deliberately misquote him?  Or is it just as likely that everyone has their own flawed memories and version of the events?

null,false,atheistmil,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"I'd suggest the point is more one of politics and how wealth is redistributed. Social security should offer a rung below which no one should fall and not a means to subsidise corporations by propping up worker pay.

In this respect increasing the income tax threshold ensures that those on low incomes pay less tax - thus helping the poorer in society. Under the last labour government taxes were increased but a lot handed back to the same people under the guise of working tax credit and the like. From their perspective it is better to have a bigger state and a state that ""everyone"" uses because then people feel a part of it. 

The tory philosophy tends to suggest that a smaller state costs less and therefore everyone (including the rich) can pay less tax.

There are also some perverse quirks in the current system which make not working an attractive proposition for some because the level of income they would need to support their current lifestyle is unobtainable. 

Those truly at the bottom often don't get the help they need, mental health care has been terrible forever and we need to more in that area. Equally, the state should not subsidise wages, Osborne has moved closer to a living wage and while you can argument it's merits economically politically it is a sound move.

The pictures look good, it seems clean and in good order. Always check it over, though. Bring a friend, or try to meet in a more public place.

First thing to check is that it starts from cold and that it's not been dropped or crashed (look for scratches, cracks etc around the bike). It's not old, and it hasn't done many miles, so I wouldn't expect you to find any major problems. However, 125's are usually people's first bikes, and sometimes the regular maintenance stuff can fall to the wayside. Best thing to check is the chain and tyres; if those are in good order, I wouldn't think you'd have anything much to worry about. Always just double check the brakes are working by rolling it to a stop. Look through the service history to get an idea of any work that has been done (probably a chain adjustment and maybe an oil change, but it won't have needed much yet).

Just looking for something relatively cheap and cheerful, willing to go up to about £60 including postage.
Thanks!

He isn't there to play really, he will put in some minutes but as few as possible to give time to the younger players. He can mold and shape all of these player like Payne, KAT and Wiggens even and bring out the best in him. If you would have watched last season at all, when he came in it was unreal the impact he had on the team from day 1. It was a complete turnaround and it was fun to watch. LaVine had a GREAT end to the season and Wiggins was, well, Wiggins. He just brought a want to the team, some passion. I honestly haven't seen a TWolves fan that is in any way other than excited for this. That, and one day he has mentioned he wants to be a part owner which is pretty cool.

Our debt has actually decreased to £28m, a £17m decrease in the last couple of years, and our increase in profits to record numbers looks to continue so that seems a non-issue right now. What are the board expected to do without investment? With the money we have, our finishes and squads we've assembled in the last 10 years have been remarkable, don't give me the history bullshit because we make fun of Liverpool for that all the time. A club's past success means fuck all in the current era and it's naive at best and ignorant at worst to think we ""should"" be expecting Champions League. Football is run by money these days and we have been overachieving in that aspect, I don't care what people's personal expectations of the club are, or if they think it's embarrassing that a top ten finish is seen as good work, it's just a matter of fact that we've done well to manage to do what we do on our budget. If the only people coming in with offers to buy are dodgy fuckers like the Venky's, or Bates or whoever then we're right not to sell. It's not their fucking fault the right person hasn't come in with an offer. How is our current era worse than in the late 90's/early 2000's? We've gone uphill more than I ever thought we would. A tiny percentage of the teams who panic sell end up better than when they had a solid board. We're a great club with a great history yes, but that means very little in today's market, look what happened to Parma.

&gt;Oh, and we haven't done a Blackburn or Portsmouth. I guess I've no right to criticise my government either since I've got running water, paved roads, and electricity.

Don't be absurd. If we had only the basic amenities and the majority of countries like us who kick them out and get a new leader go to absolute shit but oh this one club ended up doing well we should take a punt shall we? No, let's not. Your analogy was embarrassingly incomparable.

Of course we'd like a better board, but it's rare to find a better one just like that, especially for a club outside London. We need to be careful what we wish for is all I'm saying. I'd rather challenge for Europe and possibly Champions League every year (which is what we have been doing, honestly some of you sound like you've watched us just escape relegation every year for the last decade) than risk financial implosion going for the league on the back of some dodgy businessman.

null,false,mpw90,null,null,null,"There are a few pieces of information available here from personal experience.

You *can* use the tube to get to Liverpool Street from Heathrow terminals, and that will be cheaper (and hellish in the current heat). It will take you over an hour and ten minutes, and this is just the first leg of your journey.

Alternatively, you can get the Heathrow Express, which is air conditioned, spacious but more expensive (though, there is a discount available for booking in advance, and a discount for railcard users, and a discount for booking a return) and this will get you to Paddington, a few stops away from Liverpool St. Which you would then need to top up by getting a ticket to Liverpool St.

Either way, when you're at Liverpool St, I believe that Abellio Greater Anglia run the services to Chelmsford. Which is typically either Platform 10 or Platform 11. These often change, so it's best to check with a member of staff, and look at the boards. This journey one way will cost £15.10 one way in peak times. Peak times are 06:30 - 09:30, and 16:30 - 19:00. Weekends and anything else is off-peak. You can purchase super offpeak tickets. The Abellio Greater Anglia website may have advanced tickets for a cheaper fare, but this means you have to use that train. No exceptions. 

I strongly advise you travel off-peak, from an economical sense, and to actually be able to not get smashed about by commuters.

Most of this is considered quite expensive. I would also strongly advise you, if you're between the ages of 16-25 (25 included), to purchase a young persons railcard for £30, and use it for the entirety of this vacation. As it can be used all through the National Rail network. This entitles you to 1/3 off, off-peak tickets, and can be added on to an Oyster card/travel card, etc.

Someone quoted around £20. Sadly, without a railcard, Oyster card, or anything else, it will be more than this. One way as well which makes it sting even more. If you know when you're leaving, return tickets usually can just add one a few extra quid for a return leg, which I think is good.

The alternative would be to get to Victoria Station, and buy a coach to Chelmsford. Though, I'm not sure this is favourable either.

Final point: Abellio Greater Anglia are notoriously *shit*.

null,false,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"I've been reading about the Greek political class in recent years, and the problem with Greece is that the (former) established parties have a level of corruption and cronyism that would put Labour and the Tories to shame. We're talking several decades of colluding to commit wide scale economic fraud (that's after all, what started the crisis), protecting their mates, and making laws that prevented their own prosecution when they were found out. And whilst trying to claim to be political opponents they were very much in each other's beds. The crisis and them going into coalition with each other was the straw that broke the camel's back.

People voted Syriza not because Greece has suddenly become left wing (in fact, Greece is still very much a conservative country), but because they were the only credible alternative. Yes they are hopelessly naive and inexperienced, yes their actions have hurt Greece more than if they had just agreed, and yes they ultimately caved to the troika. But one thing you can't fault them on is that they are genuine - they stood up for what they believe in even when it brought them to the very edge. That already makes them better than all the other Greek parties. And Syriza is pretty much the only hope Greece has of fixing the corruption in the Greek government (And thus safeguard Greece in the future).

Edit: I should also mention that the British media has an awful tendency of infantilising the Greeks. My Greek ex actually boycotted watching bbc news as they appeared to heavily mistranslate what the Greek guy in the street was saying (apparently the guy was actually talking about government corruption and how they wouldn't communicate with the public, but the BBC translated as ""we have no money, I'm trying to get money but they won't give us money"").

null,false,Traducesar,null,null,null,"Spanish here, been living in Edinburgh for 5 years. The biggest problem the people that wants to come here usually have, is that they don't really understand what they are getting into. The scottish accent, the fact that many of them speak a much worse English than they think and the lack of information about... getting anything done (apply for jobs, know how the most basic things work, etc) is what makes that the average case is like this:

- Person comes to Edinburgh. During the summer more people come because think that during the festival finding a job will be easier.
- Person gets a place to stay. I've seen cases of people paying 400 quid a month for a room in Portobello. And happy about it.
- Person tries to find a job. Because their English is so bad, the jobs they can access are very limited.
- Person starts to work. Discover that the job is much harder than it seems and that can't understand most of the people talking with him/her.
- Person spends most of his spare time with other Spanish people. Places like the Three Sisters, many Spanish there. They make a group, and whine about how hard and difficult are things. Usually every weekend there's a welcome/goodbye party.
- Person discovers after a few months that this is a waste of time and money and goes back to Spain.

I've known cases of people that have been able to dodge all this, find a good job and get a new life, but usually the case is people that only want to stay here until they can come back to Spain, so deep down, they don't want to be part of the Scottish society. Being here is a bad thing for them.

And I understand them, and not all are like these, but there are many. Tons of Spanish have contacted me for help, to get advice, but most of the time, is to make me find them jobs or recommend them one of these agencies that find you a place to stay and a job (what?).

Of all the hundreds of Spanish that I've meet since I came here in 2010, there's only 3 (me included) that are still here, and probably for good.

90% of the time many of these problems would have been avoided if the person tried to get as much info as possible and didn't let random strangers in internet forums lie to them about how easy is to be here, and the most important thing: they should never make this kind of decision out of desperation. Think more, prepare more, get more info.

As I said, there are people that will be able to start a new life here, but that's not what's gonna happen with most. And it's really crushing when you once again see another person make the same mistakes that so many others did before him, and you know how's gonna end: a goodbye party in a few months, without any Scottish person there, because they haven't made any Scottish friend.",null,0,null,1436545911,null,0,false,0,csypy2i,null,t3_3csb68,null,t1_csypy2i,null,t3_3csb68,null,null,null,1437744420,null,10,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,10,null

""keeps devoted fans out of the stands"" - So you've just decided that the season ticket waiting list are all devoted fans based on what exactly? Couldn't they just as easily be people looking to buy and exploit a product in low supply (overcharging for tickets still exists outside of StubHub you know). More importantly, what about devoted fans who simply can't afford season tickets for the second most expensive team in the PL? What should a family of four do - they will never get that many through the Twitter accounts. StubHub is a very good option to them.

""rich tourists that don't give a fuck"" - What are you going to do, quiz them about Spurs history at the gate? Lets be honest, most rich tourists aren't going to WHL, they are going to Chelsea or Arsenal. I would presume (could be wrong) the majority of non-Londoners who go to WHL go because they want to be there. Whether they are rich or poor (what does it matter if they are rich, btw), they want to be there, and the team is an international one, so yeah, they get every right to tickets - welcome to globalization. I also fail to see how ""rich tourists"" injecting the club with money is a bad thing, but ok. Some could argue that those willing to fly thousands of miles to watch them ""deserve"" (whatever the hell that means) those tickets even more, btw. but I'm not getting into that here. 

""destroys the atmosphere"" - When you go to games (any sport) and you see tourists, they are there to have a good time. More often than not I see tourists cheering their heads off and making the place pretty fun, I have no idea what atmosphere-destruction you are talking about.
When we were down 2-0 to Southampton, I (a well to do tourist, btw) was cheering the team on until a British person asked me to stop, because who the hell knows why - apparently ""lets go"" and ""come on you spurs"" offended him. Meanwhile another guy within earshot was complaining non-stop about how shit the team were for an hour non-stop...until we won 3-2 in the 90'. Then he (another Brit, btw) was super fan #1. The atmosphere can be made great or terrible by both local and 'tourist' alike, quit pretending otherwise.

null,false,MasterBulldog,null,null,null,"As a former (im)mature student who's not long left university, my experiences. Good and bad.

Good: 

University will offer many opportunities, possibly some that pay ( Student Ambassadors, for example)

You should have staff on hand to offer support and advice, such as careers advice.

You meet some awesome people at university.

Student Unions are worth their weight in gold, and can offer you the chance to represent, which all looks great on a CV. I was psychology course rep from level 4, and for level 5. I was then voted in as the rep for the entire social sciences. A big responsibility but it looks great on my CV!

You will learn excellent skills outside of your chosen subject.

There are likely societies that can be both interesting and educational.

Bad:

Student finance won't pay you much, so you will need to get work. Work + study = always frazzled! SFE are also notoriously dense/unhelpful when you try to deal with them

Being a student is not easy, no matter what anyone tells you. Writing an essay takes a lot of work, wait until you have several due in...

Getting a university degree doesn't guarantee you a job.

Even if you leave with the highest possible grade, you will most likely not get a job that pays much better than you're getting now, at first. It is very much a ""long term"" opportunity.

being an undergraduate may not be enough, depending on what you want to do with your degree. Example, I studied psychology and sociology. In this field you need at least a Msc to be considered for a post.

Something to consider: Is your partner fully behind you? It really matters, because if they get fed up of your long hours of studying, leave you etc it can mean you don't finish your degree or your grades may suffer.

Also (and I cannot stress this enough) check the uni you go to actually offers the exact accreditation/endorsement you require. Our uni was not affiliated with the British Psychological Society, which meant that anyone getting their degree had to pay extra and do a bridge course if they wanted to go on and do a Masters. I sorted that as rep, but students that graduated before this happened still lost out.

I really hope I haven't put you off, this wasn't my objective at all. I just felt it was fair to give you a very honest ""warts and all"" account as experienced by myself.

He's shown us absolutely nothing to suggest he can be a consistent goal scorer for us.

Benteke on the other hand is scoring lts of goals for a team with very limited creativity in the Premier League and he's been doing it for a few seasons now. He's far more consistent and gets open play goals regularly, with a wide range of finishing as well. If you're going to build a system around goals then you need the striker to be able to regularly score them. Balotelli is not that guy.

It seems that technology has rendered the idea of a journal mostly obsolete, and the people who are interested on a topic could simply work together on a kind of academic github, and this could speed up academic discourse hugely and perhaps remove some of the more ill-seeming processes that are taken for granted.  But this would require funding to work differently, it would require the reputation of journals to be discarded as a signalling mechanism etc.  ",null,0,null,1436550443,null,0,false,0,csyszbt,null,t3_3ctb9f,null,t1_csyszbt,null,t1_csysfzy,null,null,null,1437746895,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Comparing Balotelli to Suarez. I mean come on. The article emphasis the fact that Suarez scored only 4 in his first season at Liverpool. Well that's because he joined halfway through the season. His first game was in February. He also ran through half the Man United defence to set up a dirk Kuyt tap in. When did Balo ever do that?

In his first full season Suarez scored over 4 times the amount of goals Balotelli did and without penalties. And that was the season when Liverpool hit the post or bar  pretty much ever game. Balotelli hasn't shown anywhere near the quality Suarez did. And Suarez consistently tried hard and put in maximum effort whereas Balotelli hasn't consistently done so. Against Basel Balotelli went the whole game without touching the ball in their box once. That is literally impossible for a striker who played the whole game as he did, unless you are trying not to do so.

So no. I don't buy the comparisons to Suarez.

Absolutely man. If my generalization rubs you the wrong way, it would be helpful to address what exactly you take issue with instead of telling me to ""stfu"" in a schoolyard bully-like manner.

&gt; ""keeps devoted fans out of the stands"" - So you've just decided that the season ticket waiting list are all devoted fans based on what exactly? Couldn't they just as easily be people looking to buy and exploit a product in low supply (overcharging for tickets still exists outside of StubHub you know). More importantly, what about devoted fans who simply can't afford season tickets for the second most expensive team in the PL? What should a family of four do - they will never get that many through the Twitter accounts. StubHub is a very good option to them.

You are correct in that it is somewhat slippery to be throwing around the ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy; it it is ultimately not productive to argue what makes a true fan. What I failed to articulate boils down to Windy's comment, that StubHub just makes it easier for Spurs fans to rip each other off. I don't live in London, but it seems to be a serious issue if groups like 1882 are so adamantly against it.

Here is a quote from [this article](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/fans-accuse-tottenham-of-encouraging-ticket-touts-with-stubhub-deal-8771263.html):

""There are a number of reasons to object to the club’s deal with StubHub. Some are ethical, some more practical. The principle that you don’t sell tickets to other fans for over face value is as basic as never changing your team and it’s a core part of the social solidarity that holds supporters together.""

&gt; ""rich tourists that don't give a fuck"" - What are you going to do, quiz them about Spurs history at the gate? Lets be honest, most rich tourists aren't going to WHL, they are going to Chelsea or Arsenal. I would presume (could be wrong) the majority of non-Londoners who go to WHL go because they want to be there. Whether they are rich or poor (what does it matter if they are rich, btw), they want to be there, and the team is an international one, so yeah, they get every right to tickets - welcome to globalization. I also fail to see how ""rich tourists"" injecting the club with money is a bad thing, but ok. Some could argue that those willing to fly thousands of miles to watch them ""deserve"" (whatever the hell that means) those tickets even more, btw. but I'm not getting into that here.

I will say this much: atmosphere is very important. In recent years the atmosphere at ALL Premier League clubs has declined, not just Spurs. Whether that is due to StubHub, globalization, increased recognition of Spurs global brand and influx of tourists, or unreasonable expectations following the 2010 Champion's League run is totally up for debate. Correlation is certainly not causation, but all of these things have been happening around the same time-period. Fighting globalization and foreign influence on the Premier League is ultimately futile and foolish. However, renegotiating terms with StubHub seems a comparatively realistic option. I was not able to find how much Spurs receive from StubHub, but none of the ticket-markup by resellers goes to the club.

&gt; ""destroys the atmosphere"" - When you go to games (any sport) and you see tourists, they are there to have a good time. More often than not I see tourists cheering their heads off and making the place pretty fun, I have no idea what atmosphere-destruction you are talking about. When we were down 2-0 to Southampton, I (a well to do tourist, btw) was cheering the team on until a British person asked me to stop, because who the hell knows why - apparently ""lets go"" and ""come on you spurs"" offended him. Meanwhile another guy within earshot was complaining non-stop about how shit the team were for an hour non-stop...until we won 3-2 in the 90'. Then he (another Brit, btw) was super fan #1. The atmosphere can be made great or terrible by both local and 'tourist' alike, quit pretending otherwise.

You bring a fantastic point. The Fighting Cock fellas have talked about this numerous times, there are plenty of crotchety and entitled local fans that would rather stew in their own misery at games instead of sing. The atmosphere argument is certainly more nuanced in that sense.

&gt; ""not much organic crowd involvement outside of college sports"" - jesus this is just so dumb I'm not going to bother.

Honestly? I can't remember the last NFL, MLB, NHL, or NBA game I went to where there was any organized crowd singing. I mean, sure the Seattle Seahawks broke Galatasaray's noise-decibels record, but it was just cacophony in a stadium designed to artificially increase noise levels. Serious question though: outside of the MLS and college sports, where will you ever find crowd involvement that is not prompted by a jumbotron? I'm not trying to be a dick, the difference in crowd-involvement is what drew me to Spurs in the first place.",null,0,null,1436550986,null,0,false,0,csytbw1,null,t3_3cp1pf,null,t1_csytbw1,null,t1_csyrb8f,null,null,null,1437747066,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

I dont know the accurate answer to that question, as I'm not an expert on online communications. However, I am somewhat well read on security studies, and by and large the majority of information security agencies utilise is publicly accessible data. Private communications are important, but they dont compromise the majority of any given suspects case file.

Real intel comes from public records and HUMINT, and the security services do a very good job of collating worthwhile data from these sources already. If private data is needed, then I would suggest the security services are made to target specific individuals, after having already built a case against them and presented their evidence of suspicion to the judiciary (and not one of these ""secret court"" judicial proceedings either).

that was really sloppy stuff.

where's the source for the claims that the hunt is needed to control fox populations? there is no evidence to support that the hunt ever affected populations and no evidence that fox populations have risen since the hunting ban.

in fact one of the sources they do cite, bateson and harris (2000) found that fox numbers did not demonstrably increase across the break in hunting during the foot and mouth crisis. why haven't they discussed that?

is this actually a real academic article? it doesn't read like one at all.

read this bit:

""One notable veterinary opponent of hunting even raised the somewhat ludicrous
question “would you hunt your own dog?” (Morton 2000), which drew some criticism for
its lack of reality (Hughes-Ross 2000, Scruton 2000). Wild animals are used to hunting
or being hunted.""

aside from how badly written that is, the sentence at the end is demonstrably untrue, in fact earlier in this same article they claimed that foxes have no natural predators? this is laughably bad.

edit: sorry i'm editing a bit now but there is no fucking way that was a published academic or scientific article, for a start it's clearly bias as fuck and it's written very, very poorly.

He's also really good at attacking quickly on the break. You can tell he was a winger because he does a lot of drifting wide and then picking up the ball and going from out to in. He carries the ball a lot, so he'll pick it up on half way and get things going by driving up the pitch. 

He gets the ball a lot at wolfsburg, and controls the game attacking wise. He gets the ball and runs with it, and then everyone else makes runs off him and he controls their attacks. Not sure how he'll do for us with Silva being the main man, but I think his energetic style would be a nice contrast to Silva's more relaxed tempo and they'd play well off each other. 

He definitely prefers to run with the ball. He's not like Nasri or Silva who will do the tiki taka stuff standing still in the opposition box with 4 people around them. He is always running. 

But other than defending, he's a player that doesn't really seem to have any weaknesses that would stop him from going all the way to the top. He's fast enough, big enough, has the brain to see things and the ability to carry the out. 

Anyway I'm not an expert but that's my impression. 

I really really hope we sign him.

But anybody can set up a journal and any anybody can churn out crap articles for it in order to inflate their publication count. So how can university administrators distinguish between ""good articles"" and ""bad articles""? Journals control the quality of articles published in them via the peer review process, so you assess the quality of the journal in order to get an idea of the quality of the articles. So you create metrics like ""Impact Factor"" that look at how often a journal's article's are cited.

Every journal has an Impact Factor and the name of the game is to get published in the high impact journals in your field. That good research (that you need to keep up with) congregates in a relatively small number of journals, which happen to be owned by an even smaller number of publishing companies. In order for you to do your work as a researcher, your institution *must subscribe to those particular journals* which means that the publisher can charge more or less what they want for them.

In theory the researchers could just revolt and start to publish in free or open access journals, but that means foregoing impact factor brown points and possibly being passed over for promotion.

Another year later, they admitted they were incorrect ALL ALONG, repaid what I had overpaid as a result of their threats, plus interest, plus all my costs.

If it had been a larger amount of money, I would not have paid - but at least I could have shown the judge that their case was entirely mistaken and based on being unable to do arithmetic.

Under the new system, if it had been a larger amount of money, they could have simply seized the money, and I would have had to fight to get it back.
