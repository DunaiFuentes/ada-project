Turns out he isn't the best at giving interviews and remaining impartial during them like some professionals are.

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"&gt; I had non-dom status for years and never earned more than £40k the whole time. I just worked for British firms in countries outside the EU. 

That's not what's being talked about - you were genuinely not in the UK when you were earning that money, so you wouldn't be eligible for UK tax.

The non-dom tax status that's being referred to was introduced back when we still had colonies, and it was for British citizens who were born in India or Kenya who came back to study and work in the UK, but who planned to leave again to settle.

Being ""non-dom"" allowed them to reside in the UK, to pay tax on their UK earnings, but - this is the crucial part - *not* be taxed on revenues on their plantation or investments back in the colonies, as long as they didn't bring those monies in to the UK.

Thus these ""non-doms"" are allowed to pay tax based on where they ""identify"" as living, not where they actually live.

In recent decades this arrangement has been used by rich people to offshore certain tax obligations - it doesn't apply to you because you don't (presumably) have a million quid in an Antiguan bank account. 

The particular person that hit the headlines this year is the HSBC chief exec who worked in Hong Kong 12 years ago. Now he lives and works in the UK, but he's employed by HSBC's Hong Kong office, and he claims non-dom status on the basis that he plans to return there. Thus he only pays tax on money he brings into the UK, and any of his wages that he puts in an offshore savings account are untaxed.

This is *not* about double-taxation for hard-working British expats.

Reasonable force doesn't include the following, because they are all ways in which the bailiff isn't allowed to enter your home or premises:

* pushing you or anyone else out of the way

* getting in through an open window

* breaking a window to get in

* taking up floorboards to access part of your property

* climbing over a fence or wall.

null,false,SpeedflyChris,null,null,null,"&gt; Yes. Education and limiting their availability is one way of doing this. Making them freely available to anyone is not going to achieve that.

""limiting their availability"" has totally failed and is doomed to continue failing. To take the example of MDMA, once supply was restricted the number of fakes went way up, and we now have far more dangerous substances such as PMA &amp; PMMA becoming more widespread. Prohibition is killing people in that group. The same is true of adulterants in cocaine and to a greater extent heroin causing deaths (including that of my 17 year old cousin) due to uncertainty with regard to purity.

Education meanwhile has failed because the government has no credibility when it comes to recreational drugs. Between sacking David Nutt for daring to give his opinion and the sort of propagandist horseshit put out through sources like ""FRANK"" is it any wonder kids don't believe what they're being told?

&gt; I really don't know what comparison you're trying to draw here. Medicinal drugs are heavily regulated and are only allowed when necessary according to your doctor. Yeah if they were banned people would die because they are vital to society. Are you trying to say you think recreational drugs have the same effect?

If anybody could sell pills marked as ""paracetamol"" for example, and pharmaceutical companies weren't making it, would it be a safe thing to take? Christ fucking no, of course it wouldn't.

Our current system makes it incredibly difficult for the users of recreational drugs to know whether what they're taking is what they're told it is, and people die as a result.

&gt; No idea, medical records are sketchy at best and populations were so much lower and society so different there is no way to make a fair comparison

That's a cop-out. Although Heroin is arguably the most extreme example of an addictive drug (with the possible exceptions of meth and maybe nicotine) the UK police kept a database of known heroin addicts back in the day, there were always fewer than 500 names: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4647018.stm

If you are so blind to the past that you cannot look back and understand that world then look at how the approach Colorado, Washington etc are taking with regard to Cannabis has reduced crime in those areas.


The bogeyman of recreational drugs is all very scary I'm sure, but the truth of the matter is that our approach has failed to help drug users, it has failed to help the wider public, and it is time for a change.",null,0,null,1428496098,null,0,false,0,cq58rwt,null,t3_31s9be,null,t1_cq58rwt,null,t1_cq58bm0,null,null,null,1432265609,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

You would be better off with something shorter and less heavy which you can swing with one hand. A hollow metal rounders bat for example is a perfect weapon in this instance. 

Secondly, UK law is fucking terrible in situations like this. Your use of force must be proportional. If someon barges into your door without a weapon and you fuck their shit up with a weapon, you could find yourself on the end of charges yourself. Especially if you don't have recorded evidence, the debt collector is likely to claim total innocence leaving you having to explain why you randomly decided to batter a debt collector who was ""just doing his job"".

Personally speaking, the legality doesn't concern me too much. I keep a hammer under my bed and if I came across someone in my house I would swing first and ask questions later.

Instead he's offered it after the election so that he has a chance of _winning_ the election. And even afterwards, he's allowed himself the time to kick the referendum away for a while.

Pros: thick cream, lovely smell and melts onto the skin. Hydrates skin nicely.
Cons: I hate the layer it leaves on my skin, it makes me feel like my skin is constantly clammy.

Palmers Anti ageing
Pros: not as thick as other formulas, glides on, absorbed very quickly, no residue, has lactic acid etc. 
Cons: I like the chocolatey smell of the palmers butters but it's definitely not as strong in this formula, it seems to be replaced with a sort of cheap flowery perfume smell. The smell doesn't pack the same kind of punch as the body shop butter which is fine by me as I don't like it anyway! I also feel that it doesn't hydrate my legs as well as the body shop ones. My skin is definitely less scaly but the texture isn't 100%

Overall: the palmers was £4.39 for 250ml in boots and the body shop butters retail for roughly about £10 for 200ml. Although I don't think anyone has ever paid full price for the body shop butters because they always seem to be on offer! I'm not sure if you can buy the Palmers elsewhere for less because I used adcard points. 

Finally! When it comes to stocking back up I'll probably buy both and alternate between them. Palmers is good pre work when you're in a rush and don't want your clothes sticking to you.

Arsenal - Giroud is pretty much good enough, and if they go for a striker they'll go bigger since they can afford to.

Chelsea - He's not better than Costa, and I doubt he'd be content playing second fiddle.

City - No reason to go for him at this point after getting Bony, plus he wouldn't be first choice here.

Spurs - Harry Kane is the second coming of Christ.  I think they'd be the biggest competition (domestically) for his signature as they'll be desperate for another striker.

null,false,benjibean,lfc93,,null,"About 15 years ago, whilst the area wasn't the nicest, it was an extremely pleasant area to be, constantly buzzing with people and trade. The council's policy over the past two decades or so has been to force families out of their homes so the club could expand the capacity of the stadium, armed with the threat of compulsory purchase orders which force owners to sell homes at a rate well below market value. 

This is generally credited within local communities as causing decline in the area. As people were being kicked out, and houses/commercial premises were being left empty, there was a subsequent general dereliction, stagnation, increase in vandalism and fires etc. 

The residents have been treated appallingly by the club and the council, and the council's only remedy was to provide them with less money (under the premise of compulsory purchasing) to move out, despite essentially causing the squalor they'd had to live in for a decade. I remember reading somewhere that the club had actually approached residents under the guise of an 'agency', so they could purchase the properties at cut down prices before the intentions of purchasing could be linked to the stadium expansion. So it seems the only thing the council are actually doing, is forcing people to move out, and providing them with less money to do so, in a hope that this cost saving will provide a greater impetus for investment. Viva Joe Anderson.

I would like to see some stability. let the team grow together and people find roles they fit into well. If a player like Paulinho or Capoue want to leave because they don't get 1st team games, thats one thing, but if someone like Soldado is fine being the back up then keep him there, yes he is expensive, but he also hasn't undermined the team (like Kaboul is accused of) and he seems to bring good locker room chemistry (as well as maturity to a young squad....as is pointed out every other fucking day).

I would only sell players who have at least 2 years (I would say three, but that is probably unrealistic) at spurs or want to leave. turning over the team every two summers is not going to produce good football.

so my thoughts are Soldado is not a sell and neither is Paulinho or Capoue (unless they want to go). Adebayor or kaboul should be sold if they can be (and in Adebayor's case, a replacement is found).

Lamela, Fazio, Stambouli, and Chiriches should be kept around unless they want to go since they all fall into the 2 years or less category (though Chiriches maybe should go since he is so far down and a youth player could be our 4th/5th CB).",null,0,null,1428500203,null,0,false,0,cq5al6u,null,t3_31qqig,null,t1_cq5al6u,null,t3_31qqig,null,null,null,1432266533,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

No it's not. You just have to figure out what everyone needs, how to get it and distribute it fairly with consideration for the consequences to other life forms and ecosystems in general. 

&gt;More or less all communist governments have been terrible. It's very relevant.

Listening to people commenting on the matter, I have never heard anyone say that the USSR or China or North Korea represent ""communism"" but since I am not a scholar on the matter, I can't argue the point. If it's a problem, I don;t feel the need to use that word. I've only followed through by saying what I thought it means in response to you bringing it up. 

I support the creation of a social organisation that provides everyone with what they need with as little destruction meted out to the Earth as possible. No one should be allowed to have more than they need unless everyone can more or less enjoy the same excess. If that tallies with Marx or not, I don't know. 

&gt;But you're quoting him?

I am telling you what my understanding of the word ""communism"" is and it sounds pretty simple to me. There  are lots of social groups working on that basis and it looks like a good idea. If those words originated with Karl Marx, OK, they sound good to me. 

&gt;It might help, since you're advocating his ideas. Wherever you lie on the political spectrum it's valuable to read Marx at some point in your life, I think.

I'm sure it could be useful. But I've listened to lots of people talking about Marx and none of them say the same thing. None of them seem to agree on what Marx was saying and none of them have a coherent view of what solutions, if any, he offered. I could read and maybe learn from this arcana but I don't think it's of the essence and it looks pretty fucking boring and obscure. 

&gt;Why do you say that?

I would take the word ""democracy"" to mean a way of running society that is in accordance with a consensus arrived at by the great mass of people living in that society.

&gt;You already know, so no need to repeat it again.

Yeah. You got pissed your post was removed and not every single other submission that fit the description were also removed.

&gt;Yes, and you still haven't admitted you were wrong and reprimanded those involved, or taken action to change the rules and your review of moderator behavior. Look, even know, rather than be professional, instead choose to attack me.

Your post was removed because it was against the subreddit's rules. I, nor any of the mods, will never apologise for that. It's your responsibility to read the rules and stick to them. It's our responsibility to enforce that. That's how moderation works. Let me make it clear. **We're not the ones who are in the wrong. YOU ARE.**. Signe put it best two years ago. It's not my fault you can't follow rules.

At least one other moderator has already previously apologised for not removing other people's posts immediately but I'll do so once again. I sincerely apologise that other submissions were not removed straight away. Yes, it's an issue and it's one that, while it can be improved upon, it will be always present in some shape or form.

As far as reprimanding those involved goes, whether it was right or not, it was a single removal made by a mod who has contributed a lot and left several months ago. There's nothing that could or would be done.

&gt;No, they downvoted me because they want to curry favor with the mods lest they be the next victims of their arbitrary and capricious dispensation of punishments. It's a reign of terror. You're only proving it here, again, by attacking anyone who criticizes you, rather than listening to and hearing their complaints.

How does that even work? We can't see the people who upvote or downvote. All we can see is the people who commented. Hell, what would we even do with the people who ""have our favour""?

We do listen to and hear complaints. Even this bullshit complaint has gotten far more of our attention that it needed.

&gt;Yes, so many people -- other mods and their cronies, which you've now enlisted in a downvote brigade of my post. Funny how it was at +4 before you showed up!

People can make their own decisions whether they want to upvote you or downvote you. They did it based on their own evidence. You're seeing exactly what they're seeing. I've not enlisted anyone, something which is against Reddit's rules. It's just the opinions of people watching. All I did was fill in the context.

&gt;And you're stalking me now? Talk about someone who needs to get over it already.

No, I'm not, never was and never will. You think you're THAT interesting or important?  I've already mentioned it but I guess I'll have to explain it.

I, like many other moderators, used the now-dead MetaReddit to monitor keywords (e.g. ""doctorwho"" (for /r/DoctorWho), ""/gallifrey"" (for /r/Gallifrey), etc) to see what people are saying about the subreddit (both inside and outside the subreddit). Your comment simply triggered one of them off. Normally, I don't comment but since your comment was unfairly attacking us moderators in a public place, I felt that we are free to defend ourselves.

And I would do it again.

&gt;Here's some actual feedback: you're all still terrible for how you've treated me, you should all apologize, reverse your decision, change the rules, and then all resign for not doing a better job. Re-read this feedback ever week until it's done. Now you can no longer claim you haven't had any actual feedback in ""so long"".

How WE treated YOU? What? We removed one of your posts. We didn't ban you, shadowban you, insult you or abuse you. Just removed one of your posts. You're the only user who has considered themselves this important to keep going on about it.  Now lets turn this on the other foot. For years now, you've been making derogatory remarks about us, calling for our heads and disrupting the subreddit. All because we removed your stamps.

For the record, this is not proper feedback. Your post was and still is against the rules (Merch that was mass manufactured). If people want a rule changed, they can give reasoning and see how popular that sentiment is.

Right. That's an enormously complex task, riddled with opportunity for corruption. Who gets to decide? Who monitors it? How do we choose those people? You've already ruled out democracy so I'm hoping you have some ideas.

&gt; Listening to people commenting on the matter, I have never heard anyone say that the USSR or China or North Korea represent ""communism"" but since I am not a scholar on the matter, I can't argue the point. If it's a problem, I don;t feel the need to use that word. I've only followed through by saying what I thought it means in response to you bringing it up.

I can't argue the point either, however I don't really care if they were truly communist or not. The whole idea is unworkable in my opinion, and leaves people far less free (either politically or economically) than the present system. 

&gt; I'm sure it could be useful. But I've listened to lots of people talking about Marx and none of them say the same thing. 

Since you're advocating a system close to if not exactly communist, I'd imagine it would make at least interesting reading. I found it a bit heavy going after a while.

&gt; I could read and maybe learn from this arcana but I don't think it's of the essence and it looks pretty fucking boring and obscure.

Hardly boring or obscure, here we are debating it in 2015!

Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University asked: “This is a joke, right?” He continued: “The only interesting question is how much GDP has been lost as a result of austerity. Based on [Office for Budget Responsibility] numbers, you can derive a ‘lowest estimate’ cumulative GDP loss of 5 per cent of GDP (that is about £1,500 for each adult and child). A best guess could be nearer 10 per cent of GDP, although a lot depends on how monetary policy would have reacted.”

Most of the people involved in that article are connected with the Isaac Brock Society, a Canadian group that encourages people to renounce their US citizenship and regularly publishes scaremongering PR about the IRS coming to steal your house in Ontario. Pronounce me unimpressed that they're objective parties. As an immigrant from the US who has lived here for years I have seen many, many people advocate giving up citizenship because taxes; many, many times they have a vested interest in doing so, whether for political reasons or financial reasons (lots of lawyers and accounts out there just waiting to ""help you"" expatriate). 

Furthermore, I'm not speculating that the IRS doesn't care: http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/New-Filing-Compliance-Procedures-for-Non-Resident-U.S.-Taxpayers

&gt; **For those taxpayers presenting low compliance risk, the review will be expedited and the IRS will not assert penalties or pursue follow-up actions.**

In other words, it's not worth us to chase people over a $500 tax bill, so we won't. File your taxes and get on schedule, and it's fine.

The IRS just isn't interested in your average taxpaying expatriate, I hold that position through long experience with the IRS in and out of the US and I still hold it no matter what that article says.

The 2.27% in that analysis considers things like central reservation medians and roundabouts as 'natural space'. You can't possibly include things like pavement grass verges as undeveloped potential land for development. 

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/3D7MKdd.jpg) the Almondsbury Interchange outside Bristol. This report would say it's only taking up the space directly underneath each lane. I say It's taking up the entirety of it's surroundings, save for the small segments in each corner. This is true for 99% of other motorways that don't just stop at the hard shoulder, but have huge banks of unnatural wind-breaking coniferous trees. 

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/lGKjSrJ.jpg) the width of a random strip of the M4. It's around 34m wide. The [bank](http://i.imgur.com/iwAuqnV.jpg) that runs along the almost full length of the motorway is almost 27m wide. That's an extra 80% on top of the area that's paved.

The report itself estimates that it's more like 10.6% that's urbanised (if you don't start playing stupid games like counting hanging-baskets as public recreational land), and [this](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/well-being/publications/land-use-in-the-uk.pdf) paper indicates it's more like 11.8%.

So yeah, 11.8%, big whoop - that leaves us with 88.2% of the land left we can build on. Build Baby, Build! No. The rest of the UK that isn't urbanised is almost exclusively agricultural land that's used to *feed us*, at around 75% (and that's with us importing 40% of our food).

So for every one mini roundabout you concrete over and build a home, you'll need to turn another seven into high-yield arable plots. If you decide to build on agricultural land, you'll have to hire a load of Dutchmen to reclaim 7x that from the sea for farms.

Negative equity is a serious issue, and here is why, you buy a house for £300,000, it depreciates in value, it is now worth £250,000, firstly you can't afford the £50K to sell the house, so you are stuck in it, so why not just live in it right? You could do that, but lets say you get another job, 200 miles away, just sell up and move, but you can't, you can't afford to, your social mobility has just been welded to the spot in that house, because you can't afford to sell it.

Then a lot of people will be using the property market as a source of income, buy a house, do up the house, sell your nice shiney new looking house for a profit, until you buy the house and now you are stuck in the house, but the house needed refurbishing and essentially that was your business, refurbishing houses, not any more you are out of a job all while stuck with a loan against a house you don't want.

Also there is the point that even people who are using houses to live in, say for a 10 year stretch, the reason they brought was also as an investment, maybe they make 6% a year where in the bank it would make 1% or on the markets it would make 4%, if they are making 0%, or negative percentage point, that is no better than renting, especially when you take all the risk if the house just decides it has had enough and is going to completely fall apart, if you are renting just move on it isn't your problem, as an owner that is your problem.

Then there comes true economic issues, if everyone just holds and sits in their houses, there is no market, there is no buying and sell, because there is nothing to buy, nothing is for sale, irrelevant of whether the sellers still want to live in it, you just end up with thousands of people not wanting to be where they are and thousands not being able to buy property where they want to be, and then not even wanting too anyway in case it falls in values.

&gt; But Moon cut ties with America three years ago, after new banking laws aimed at tax evaders required expats like her to file more thorough US tax returns. She was five years behind on the news. “I was terrified we’d lose all our money,” she says.
&gt; 
&gt; After back-filing years of tax returns, Moon renounced her US citizenship in 2012. It was a defiant act she describes as being one of the first canaries to leave the coalmine as US banking laws make life more difficult for American expatriates. She wasn’t pleased she had to do it.    

And this?

&gt; In February this year, the US and Canadian governments signed an intergovernmental agreement to co-operate on Fatca. The Foreign Accounts Taxation Compliance Act required all foreign banks to disclose the financial information of any American with assets over $50,000 sitting in banks outside of the US.

Steep penalties add muscle to the law. **If a foreign bank – not just in Canada, but anywhere – fails to report even a single US citizen as a customer to the IRS**, the US Treasury department would withhold 30% of the banks’ US income as penalty.

They're targeting banks with ANY US customer. 

&gt; In other words, it's not worth us to chase people over a $500 tax bill, so we won't. File your taxes and get on schedule, and it's fine.

So you do have to pay tax? Eventually that $500 becomes $1000, then $2000, etc if you refuse to pay or forget. You've done nothing to prove that they're just attacking rich money launderers, you've just proved that you do have to pay tax or they will eventually find out and fine you if you owe a lot.

I get the feeling that those who subscribe and actively enjoy /r/gallifrey enjoy the entire ecosystem and the Whoniverse as a whole. They are able to adopt the cultures, backstories &amp; more, all those intricate little things that make the universe so in depth. They are there to discuss the tales of the world, not the stories. To them, the legend of The Doctor and his world are a given, and we're along for the ride.

Here at /r/DoctorWho, I think it attracts more around the celebration of the show. All the merchandise, the cosplay, the episode guides/reviews. People still enjoy the story, but the story for a lot of people here stops at the show. They watch it, it ends, and if they found what they watched boring, or didn't empathise with a situation, or found something predictable, then they express their dislike of that episode - say kill the moon. They didn't like that it was dumb that the moon was an egg. And they hate Clara, and her anger is getting on everybodies nerves.

Somebody at /r/gallifrey may think ""ok, on the face of it, that was a poor episode. The moon was an egg, what the hell?! and Clara was naggy and annoying."" - but they accept that now that's canon. The moon was an egg. Weird. But what's more important is that we're watching a man still learning to find his new boundries. There he is offering to give Clara control, which he thinks she will enjoy, because she is a control freak, and he's not realising that the situation is a grey area. He literally handed off a huge decision, and she's asking for his help, and he doesn't realise she truly needs it. He thinks he's being dashing and mysterious and flashing that classic ego 11 she admired in 11 so much, but he's doing it in such a way that to him it seems similar- to her he couldn't be more different. And he can't see this because he's got a million and one things going on in his head. He's thinking about Gallifrey, and how he's going to find it. He's thinking about some of the other times he's had to make a similar choice, or times where he couldn't make the choice and how he wished somebody had passed control onto him. Which takes him back to his fourth incarnation, when....

So yeah, 45 minutes to get that across is possibly a wate of good time. And /r/DoctorWho knows that. but /r/Gallifrey is just glad that they have managed to flesh out that little bit more, and connect a few more dots.


EDIT: I just found an awesome example on /r/gallifreys no stupid questions thread. Think of all the NuWho Dalek episodes, excluding Ecclestones, as their story is pretty self contained. /u/Trobertson56 asked:

""Was there ever an explanation given as to why the Daleks are still around even after being apparently wiped out in the time-war?""

I can see /r/DoctorWho as isolating each Dalek story, and enjoying each one on it's own merit. This could cause confusion, and indeed the question above needs to be asked. but now look at them all as a whole, as in /u/icorrectpettydetails answer:

""Yes, the Cult of Skaro escaped the Time War in the void ship from the end of series 2. After the other three got destroyed in Series 3, Dalek Caan went back to the Time War, losing his marbles in the process, and rescued Davros from his death. Davros then built an army of Daleks out of his own cells, which were destroyed by the Clone Doctor in Series 4. One group managed to escape and used a Dalek Progenitor, which holds proper mutated Dalek DNA, to create another Dalek army which exist to this day.""

His speed masks his inadequacies but again he's not 'bad' he's just fast and average. Sure against certain teams his plain-jane play can be incredibly effective when other methods of breaking the opponent down aren't working. However 99.9% of Premier League defenders have him figured out.

I sound harsh but its my honest opinion, he can be what you need in games where the opponent is compact but you're not looking at a game-changer and frankly i don't think he would make it into the XI of any other top 4 side, I even see him struggling to get into Liverpool's XI.

null,false,barejokez,null,null,null,"i'll try and do a quick example, using first direct's mortgages (because i know where to find the information quickly).

[mortgage 1 is a 3 year fixed](http://mortgages.firstdirect.com/mortgage-rates/product/3-year-fixed-repayment--standard~14)

[mortgage 2 is a lifetime variable](http://mortgages.firstdirect.com/mortgage-rates/product/life-tracker-repayment--standard~71)

the first has a 3 year period where you pay 2.29%.  you then switch to paying the SVR (which is a rate calculated internally at the bank, and arguably a little bit non-transparent). the current SVR is 3.69%

the second has no initial period, you pay BoE base rate plus 1.29% for life.  So the rate will be 1.79% until rates change.  

The big advantage of the variable mortgage is that it starts off cheaper. if you are a little bit brave and take a view on base rate staying low then you can save money (assuming your view is correct). with the fixed rate you pay a bit more but you get 3 years of certainty.

As you can see, both mortgages allow prepayments as a lump sum or increasing your regular payments. the other key difference is that you will be penalised for paying back in full the fixed rate mortgage during the initial period (eg: if you sell the house for some reason or see a cheaper mortgage elsewhere).  With the variable, you can pay it back at any time.

there are other differences such as fees, but these are arguably less important than the above.",null,0,null,1428503493,null,0,false,0,cq5ceom,null,t3_31v2a5,null,t1_cq5ceom,null,t1_cq5b226,null,null,null,1432267391,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

You get the same thing if you go to a convention, particularly one that specializes in and caters to a specific property.

Say you go to DragonCon each year in Atlanta, GA, USA. Sure, there's a healthy dose of fans there for DW/TW, but there's a large number of people there, and they have diverse opinions and interests. In person, you're less likely to see people exclaim with great vitriol the same comments that are posted here. Mostly because calmer minds will correct their indiscretion and other opinions will get just as much visibility (unless you're soft-spoken.) You can also find folks who share your opinion who are much more well adjusted than the ""I hate (person x)!!"" buggers. 

Then you go to a specific convention, one that caters ONLY to your favorite property, and you'll find even MORE rabid fans with intense interests and opinions. These are the fans that live, breathe, and sweat their fandom. Their entire life usually revolves around this fandom. Sure, you have casuals that come and go, but it's just like the hardcore dedicated Trekkies from the 80's who had nothing but the movies and the 60s TV show to celebrate. 

The point: leave it to the least rational and most immature among our fandom to think that anyone cares when they start proclaiming with great hatred their dislike of anything. Clara, Rory, Amy, Matt, Peter, anything - if fault can be found, the worst among the fandom will find it. And if they can't find fault, they'll create something minute to harp on.

Doctor Who is very different today than it was during the tenure of RTD. But then again, RTD's run was very different from the classic series that long-time fans knew and loved. Doctor Who is still on the air. It's arguably more popular and widely known than it's ever been. For that, we should be thankful. 

And if you want to have an opinion that's mean-spirited, negative, and incendiary, that's up to you. For me? I never read those worthless, vapid posts because there's nothing of substance in them. They're just angry rants from an overly sensitive twit who thinks that their opinion is more important than anyone else's - or so they want the validation to show - because even though I don't much care for the Amy/Rory/River storyline, I sure didn't post any angry nerd rants about it...why? Because why the hell does it matter what I think about something? It's just my opinion and I don't need to validate it by posting or defend it by starting a fight.

Instead, everybody lives. And we watch, and we cry, and we laugh, and we dress up in costumes, and we share with new viewers. Because that's how it should be. 

So until the next season starts, always remember these important words:

If so it still raises problems. The Doctor losing his memories explains why he never tried to go back, but if all of Gallifrey's history was opened up then there should be other time lords from the pre-war era zipping about.

I know that the Doctor and the Master are exceptions in how much they travel and that most of the time lords were homebodies who rarely left Gallifrey, but for not one from all of Gallifrey's history to travel anywhere near enough to the Doctor for him to hear about it seems very unlikely.

And before you say the Master, I'm not sure if he counts since we don't know how/when/or even if he got out of the time lock. For all we know Missy was his form before Professor Yana, and when the Doctor defeats him this time he'll get blasted away to the end of time. 

Or maybe he somehow managed to pop out of one of the cracks in time.

In order for TDE to work, those at the top end of the earnings scale need to spend and invest in the community. They aren't. What is actually happening is they are sitting on it, letting it earn interest and investing it in their own circles, and it is *staying* at the top. Or it is leaving the country and investment is going to the Middle East (Dubai etc) and developing economies like China. Very little of that wealth is actually trickling down at all. It is the middle classes, those earning around the top tax rate threshold, who are generating jobs, local opportunities and most of the trickle-down wealth.

As a centrist I have no problem at all with rich folk being rich. If you earnt your way to the top, that's totally cool, good on you. I think mansion taxes and a raise in upper rate tax are the wrong way to go about things; the tax currently being collected needs to be spent far more wisely. I have been on both sides of the fence, myself, and initially supported Cameron in 2010, until corruption and greed reared their ugly head (again). But nondomicile status allows those at the top to flaunt the rules that everyone else *does* play by. It cannot be one rule for high earners and one rule for everybody else.

Great point. In a system like this, where you have a Mitchell that scouts and reports on WHO will play, and a Poch that strategizes and dictates HOW we'll play, communication is crucial. Mitchell can adapt his searching and scouting to how Poch wants to play, and Poch can adapt his playing style to the players made available to him by Mitchell/budget constraints.

null,false,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,null,"&gt; let's say that the urban space in the UK is actually double the originally claimed figure. We're now at ~5% of total.

Or you could use the established figure, which is 11.8% or 10.6%, depending which source you cite.

&gt;The paper you quote states that the total agricultural area used in the UK is 69.1% (table on page 17). So, we have 25% left that is neither urbanized (even by our much inflated definition of such) nor used for agriculture. As such, we can still double the current urbanized area and have about a fifth of the overall space left. 

The land left after 69.1% (agricultural) and 11.8% (Urban and developed land) is 7.1% 'Non-farm grass, mountains, moors and
heath' and 9.2% non-farm woodland.

So yeah, you could possibly double the urban/developed space in the UK by razing the last of our forests and concreting over the remaining wild moorland.

null,false,savardfaire,null,null,null,"&gt; But Moon cut ties with America three years ago, after new banking laws aimed at tax evaders required expats like her to file more thorough US tax returns. She was five years behind on the news. “I was terrified we’d lose all our money,” she says.
&gt; After back-filing years of tax returns, Moon renounced her US citizenship in 2012. It was a defiant act she describes as being one of the first canaries to leave the coalmine as US banking laws make life more difficult for American expatriates. She wasn’t pleased she had to do it.

So the administrator of the Isaac Brock Society and head of The Alliance for the Defense of Canadian Sovereignty thinks Americans are coming to steal your money? Quelle surprise! Next thing you'll tell me she has no job and heading up her society is her only income.....no way! 

&gt;Steep penalties add muscle to the law. If a foreign bank – not just in Canada, but anywhere – fails to report even a single US citizen as a customer to the IRS, the US Treasury department would withhold 30% of the banks’ US income as penalty.
They're targeting banks with ANY US customer.

Yes, the US government is going to trigger a worldwide financial crisis by garnishing 30% of a bank's income. 

&gt; So you do have to pay tax? Eventually that $500 becomes $1000, then $2000, etc if you refuse to pay or forget. You've done nothing to prove that they're just attacking rich money launderers, you've just proved that you do have to pay tax or they will eventually find out and fine you if you owe a lot.

If you owe money to the US government and didn't file any tax returns, it's always in your interest to pay up. But the US government is not going to file an extradition request and start a financial crisis over somebody's unpaid capital gains tax bill for their two bedroom in Altrincham. There are hundreds of thousands of people in the US much more in the hole than John Q. Expat who live their day to day lives just fine.

&gt; You've done nothing to prove that they're just attacking rich money launderers, you've just proved that you do have to pay tax or they will eventually find out and fine you if you owe a lot.

Well, except for the bit where the IRS says *themselves* that they don't care about people with minimal tax liabilities, which are the vast majority of expats. It's like wondering why HMRC doesn't take self-employed tax evasion very seriously; they don't want you doing it but they're not going to spend more than the tax liability chasing you down. 

I get the impression you think the IRS is much more powerful than it really is.

I think he's better tactically than many give him credit for, my only serious problem with him is his insistence on Nolan (who has played like an average midfielder of late), and some other favorites who are gone now (O'Neil and Taylor, when they were both past it).  I think Carroll is our best striker so I have no problem playing him, I think he works quite well with Sakho paired with him.

I do think he tends to play for a draw too easily.  He's extremely pragmatic and conservative when it comes to putting points up.  As someone who played defender my entire life, I certainly understand his desire for clean sheets.  I appreciate the emphasis he puts on defense.

Can he take us further?  He did get Bolton (BOLTON) into Europe, but didn't sustain anything.  Just because he hasn't done it before doesn't mean he can't do it again.

However, I think all this is moot, because of one thing, and it's the thing that matters:  MONEY.  He's the 13th highest paid manager in the world, with results that don't meet that!  So I am sure the Daves are saying, ""Look, you're not living up to that.""  And Sam is saying, ""I won't sign a new contract for less money than I'm making now!""

I like the inclusion of Janmaat, who I've been championing as our first choice RB/RWB for next year, and Sissoko, who I can definitely see running from deep, giving our midfield more legs.

I'm really unsure about Christian Gunter....he's looked good at Freiburg at times, but he was taken apart when I watched England Under-21s v Germany Under-21s recently. I'm not sure he's enough of an upgrade on Moreno, and I'd say they're too close in age as well. I'd personally look at someone 25/26 who can help Moreno develop.

Vietto would be a good buy I think but I'd argue that Icardi would actually be better; he's a little bit older, but wouldn't cost much more and I think he's got a bit more bite about him. Veretout has looked quality whenever I've seen him. As discussed with other people though, Pjanic is still the dream ;).

Kongolo is an absolute beast and young enough to improve even further.

Pjanic=2. Roma are challenging for the league in an albeit slightly worse league than ours. They are guaranteed Champions League at this point and Pjanic is key to that.

Not sure if you mean Lars or Sven Bender. Either are probably around a 4-5. Dortmund aren't doing well, but it seems they've turned the corner and this season is likely to prove a blip. Leverkusen are all but guaranteed top 4 at this point too. So both would command a hefty fee, and whether they'd accept our bids is uncertain.

I will fight one election at a time [and] I will decide the content of our next manifesto when we get there, and people can decide whether or not they vote for that.”

&gt;But in one of the clearest statements yet that the SNP could introduce a second plebiscite within the next Scottish parliament, she was booed by some parts of the audience when she said: “If the people of Scotland don’t vote for a party with a commitment in a manifesto to a referendum, there won’t be another referendum, that’s the point I’m making.

Addiction is a slippery term, and the distinction between psychological and physiolocial addiction even more so. But [*""DSM-IV indicates that diagnoses of substance dependence should be further characterized with regard to the presence of a physiological component, defined by tolerance or withdrawal.""*](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ajp.155.6.733)

If we accept that definition that physiological addiction is defined by tolerance and withdrawal, and we accept the common knowledge that MDMA causes withdrawal (""come down"" and cravings as per your first source, and more [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19836170)) and that users also develop a tolerance (as described [here](http://jop.sagepub.com/content/19/1/71.short), also more accessible although less valid/scientific discussion[here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/addiction)), then it's a pretty straight forward deduction that MDMA can fall under the definition of physiological addiction.

Those ""irrelevant opinions"" were a statement of common knowledge backed up with a fit-for-purpose source. Most people already accept the statements, so it's not worth the waste of my time or your time looking through in depth and inaccessible scholarly articles, unless you want to. The first post was concise. This post says basically the same as my first post, but it's now 3 times the length, half as accessible and twice as boring and intimidating.

Finally, I don't really appreciate the tone of your response. You seem like a smart individual. If I was smarter than most others, probably like yourself, I'd like to think I wouldn't be a dick about it.

I spoke to them and expressed my intention to undertake a new adventure.” literally shit talking? He's just telling his plans honestly and didn't disrespect Chelsea anyway either. If that's shit talking by your definition, you need to look up what it means.

It's not like he was given a chance to prove himself in the first place. He was signed last winter and the excuse was that he needs a full preseason to adjust. Next season comes, preseason goes and he still gets limited minutes either against much weaker opposition with other bench players or sub appearances in games that are over. I think Mourinho is a top 2 manager in the world, but even he has his flaws like every manager in history.  

You're acting like Mourinho's decisions are always perfect and just because somebody can't break the first team, they're shit. That's just not true or ""easy at that."" Very few players can succeed in limited, scarce minutes. The vast majority of players need to play a string of starts together to get adjusted to the team and get good form. Not everybody can be a super sub who's ready to go and contribute right away. 

You think it's a coincidence that the most of our subs, barring Remy (who still got screwed a lot by being second choice to Drogba despite being more effective than Drogba as much I love the legend), have looked mediocre or bad most of the season? No. It's because they get scrap minutes, are expected to play and have perfect chemistry with the first team, and often end up doing too much to try to prove themselves as more than a sub/backup.

I know we're all Chelsea fans here, but you have your Chelsea-tinted glasses on a bit too much here. A young player going to a club that actually gives him a chance is not him settling for second, despite your bias. He still has time to grow at Fiorentina into a world class player and join a top club again.

 [**Virtual private network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual%20private%20network): [](#sfw)

&gt;A __virtual private network__ (__VPN__) extends a [private network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network) across a [public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public) network, such as the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). It enables a computer or network-enabled device to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were directly connected to the private network, while benefiting from the functionality, security and management policies of the public network.  A VPN is created by establishing a virtual [point-to-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_(network_topology\)) connection through the use of dedicated connections, virtual [tunneling protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocols), or traffic encryption. Major implementations of VPNs include [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN) and [IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec).

Morgan Schneiderlin would make a great addition too, but he moved to Southampton whn he was 19 and wouldn't count as a 'HG' player. Which means either Ramires or Mikel might/should be sold, in my opinion. IF he does make the move, it'll give Mourinho the option of using a Matic-Schneiderlin pivot and use Oscar/Fabregas at #10 when the there needs to be rested.

null,false,strifeblood,null,null,null,"He wasn't that good because he wasn't given a chance to play consecutive matches together because Mourinho, who while being one of the best managers still has flaws, doesn't rotate. Why do you think Salah and Schurrle are finding success now that get playing time? Players need time together with the rest of the first team in important matches to get to form. He was the best leftback in the world last year. 

I also don't think he should ever be starting over Dave, I was thinking he could play on the left while Dave plays on the right. While we lose somebody who can score headers, I feel we gain much more in the Luis-Dave combo than Dave-Iva. Luis is better going forward, knows actually when to go forward, has great linkup play with Hazard, can whip in crosses from the left, can score free kicks and has the pace to get back into the picture on counters. Dave would also be playing on his natural rightback position where he's still as good defensively obviously but also much more effective and comfortable going forward since he can whip in crosses from the right.

There are also some big issues with Dave-Iva. Dave, while defensively solid at leftback, doesn't really offer anything going forward. He seems to only be able whip in crosses from the right, so he doesn't do much even when he goes forward. I also can't tell you how many times the opposition counters against a back 3, which is the main reason for Cahill's dip in form and why the more athletic Zouma excels, because Ivanovic doesn't have the speed to get back and even contest. Ivanovic has also been awful lately on set pieces. He's just falling asleep, leaving unmarked headers that lead to goals like PSG at home and Aston Villa away.

I never really watched it when I was younger but I think I recall watching the 4-1 smashing against United with my friend. Last year me and my brother started playing FIFA and I got interested in it and trying to make money, people told me a good way to make money was investing in in-form players by watching the games and seeing if anyone gets a hat-trick. I think the first game I watched to scout was the Everton game and it was such an amazing match. I didn't actually know the importance of it but I knew that Sturridge would have got a hat-rick had he not skied that penalty. I kept on watching Liverpool because they seem to produce cool performances every week and were just a joy to watch. My brother was getting more pissed off and so were my friends who were (cum-guzzling whores) ManU supporters. Suarez was growing into my favourite player alongside our fantastic captain Stevie G. I started watching it weekly and was absolutely ecstatic with all of the amazing performances we had. I love how even though I had no recollection of loving this club I still returned to it when choosing my favourite team. I think it was at the beginning of this year that I started religiously following Liverpool FC though. I had bought the home kit and away kit (and recently a classic kit from 64/65 season)  and I looked at this subreddit daily for news and rumours and opinions on Liverpool. I guess with the bad beginnings to the season I actually grew stronger as a fan and learned how we should always support the team and it's rich tradition of ""YNWA""  I'd say that I'm super passionate about Liverpool and my favourite day of every week is match-day.

I'm definitely not an anarchist but I'm still what many have called, 'the radical left,' a term I hate. I'd probably consider myself a unionist in the very lose terms that I believe in the idea of our political and economic union, which I suppose makes me a Unionist! I'd go as far to say I believe that England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland should be united as one political union because I see little difference between the British and Irish, with equal powers being devolved to different regions with GB and Ireland. (e.g. London, Edinburgh, Belfast, Dublin, Yorkshire, Cork, Scottish Highlands etc.) We have are little quirks and differences but overall we're culturally the same and mostly believe in the basic tenants of socialism and welfare (with a few exceptions, of course) - many forget how socialism or socialist ideas has influenced a lot of policy in this part of the world. Policy that we take for granted and fight for these days, left and right. It's a fairly outlandish view that will never happen in the near future but the world can change very quickly. 

As for voting I vote for Lady Sylvia Hermon because she represents North Down very well and takes the Labour whip so at least she votes against Tory cuts and other policy but would lean towards the Lib Dems moves on social policy while in government. Knowing her loosely as a family friend she tends to lean to the left and she is a unionist so I'm happy enough. Not perfect but can do A LOT worse. IMO best MP in Northern Ireland. 

If I lived outside of North Down I wouldn't vote for any of them. None of them are worth my vote. I'd sooner vote the SDLP than DUP or UUP. I'd probably side with Alliance if it was for tactical reasons but I wouldn't vote for them either as I'd identify them as slighty authoritarian in their actions while being part of governing this country, especially Mr. Ford.

Even when we where second the complaints where ridiculous; we cant win every year; thats the nature of the game, we where dominating so it was only a matter of time before other teams bought well to challenge us, now we are in their shoes we'll buy to challenge back. Also the air of entitlement that seems to have come over us (not pointing fingers, just speaking generally) is ridiculous; I understand given the investment in this squad and the increasingly extortionate ticket prices we are to some degree entitled to expect success but when did second become a disaster? Sure now we're in 4th and there is a lot more room to grumble but provided we secure top 4, this season hasn't been totally calamitous.

My most recent FM save with WH has been brilliant. tbh i cheated a bit and got rid of some of the debt and added about 20 mil to the transfer budget (not adding money to the bank though, so i still had to pay for it). Brought in Jordan Rhodes and won the FA cup the first season. It was terribly lucky though. Needed to come from 2-0 down to beat like Brighton in the final. 

Won the league my 5th season or so but it was also super lucky. Downing was on fire on the right wing, Rhodes scored 25+ goals, Ravel was impressive and Tomkins and Reid were solid too. Most importantly I won the league in like 82 points though. Which is a record low for the premier league. I pretty much did the double on every team I should beat and played super defensive against all the top4  teams which worked really well. 

Now i'm on like 2022 with Marco Reus as my new signing. he's a bit old but I needed to bring in someone with some experience as 90% of my team is under 25.

It depends what the gaps will be.  The problem is too many people think high earners are just sat at a belt, I've visions of Charlie and the Chocolate factory, sat down screwing on  tooth paste caps.  This isn't the case at all.  Everyone else is already competing for their jobs, there isn't a role they have, it's not simple repetitive.

Some just sit back and watch the money flow in, they've trusted people doing everything that doesn't require a decision, they can easily do that from Singapore.

The question is about the benefit they have being on the ground in the UK so to speak, are they spending money here, consuming services here.  That is bringing money in that would otherwise being spent in say Singapore.

As for filling the proven market, people are already trying to do that, it's the free market way, you see one enterprise but you can make it better, you do so, hence why we've Aldi and Lidl doing well despite the incumbents having decades of head start.

So it really has to be turned round, what's the benefit to that person spending more than 90 days a year in the UK?  If we've got enough, then super, that person will stay and pay the tax.  If the tax is higher than the benefit they get living here, they won't, that's their right.

The case of the one guy I knew before, just because he was living and working in London so much benefited those around him (myself included, so obviously I'm biased in the way, even thou, for the record, I didn't like him as a person) this is not just because of the capital he can inject, but by actually being in a place, living there, it changes your perspective on it, you are more likely to invest in some local venture.

They DO however have a big allowance I read somewhere about it being about $92,000.

It's been a while since my tax exams but UK tax law says that if you're ordinarily resident then you pay UK tax on ALL the income you make anywhere on the planet. However it doesn't mean they tax you as if it was earned in the UK. They will often give relief for tax already paid on this income. 

Thus if I make say £100K in Hong Kong and pay their 15% income tax (it will be less due to the personal allowance). The first £10K is free due tot he UK personal allowance. the next £20K then gets taxed at 34% (Income tax + NI)  the remaining 70K will get taxed at 41%

So HMRC will demand £34,858.28. Except I already handed over £15,000 to the HK government. So the UK government will want the difference of £19858.28

What normally happens is the people working overseas simply don't tell the UK government. Which is kind of reasonable in that you pay taxes for services. If you are absent then you cannot use services.

traore - prolly equal quality to moreno and far more experienced 
luis garcia - experienced at this stage of his career, not as talented as raheem

But who's to say it's not just other teams playing well. Every team has bad spells. Look at Arsenal in the beginning of the year. Would you say their players were moping around not giving a damn? I think it's just a bad spell. Maybe there's 1-2 players that could put a little bit more effort. But I don't think it's fair to assume the entire team has just given up based on a reasonable cyclical fall in form. It's far more likely that the bad results are causing a fatigue in moral which could explain the snowball effect. I doubt that the players are just showing up not giving a damn. At least the majority of them. 

I do agree with the tactical deficiencies. The 4-4-2 needs to go where the sun don't shine.

For everyone moaning about Rodgers' tactical/defensive lack - let's remember before Arsenal we had 6 clean sheets on the road, which is a prime example of adapting tactically from last season when we were scoring heaps of goals. To keep 6 clean sheets with a defence that is in progress and a goalkeeper who only a few months ago was dropped for Brad Jones demonstrates excellent man management/tactical prowess. Rodgers may have certain faults but I rate him highly, hopefully the fairytale can come true and we can reverse the results with Arsenal from last season when we thumped them and then they beat us in the FA Cup and went on to win it. We can then win the FA Cup on Gerrard's birthday, although just like Carragher's last game when he hit the post from 30 yards out it just might not happen.

I became a member for this reason. I've been voting Green ever since I could do so, but the silly policies imo (almost forced vegetarianism, anti-nuclear, anti-GMO, positive discrimination for women in jail time) are being pushed out by the number of less radical people joining in the last few years.

I went to conference (for the first time) this year, and everyone I spoke with was saying that the newer members are bringing the party slightly more to centre ground - which was seen as a problem by some, but as a blessing by most. 

There are also some issues imo around the defence policy, which needs an overhaul - mainly because there aren't many ex-army types in the Green party of whom have the specialism to steer it in a more liberal direction - this should hopefully change.

There are vocal movements in the party for many of these contentious issues, none so more than the voice against any form of nuclear power; The policy is in the process of being reviewed, it will feature heavily in the discussions between members - and will be discussed and voted upon in the autumn.

For example, it's easy for the Tories to claim ""fracking will boost the UK economy and lower energy prices"", but that won't happen if the oil price falls below the price at which it costs to frack in the first place (which, as it turns out, is unprofitable at the current oil price).

VED allows you to use the road. The road is owned by pedestrians. Look it up if you don't believe me. Ever since Road tax was abolished and funding for road maintenence started to come from council tax, you pay VED for the right to use the road. Drivers don't own it.

&gt; *“It is a sad truth that many English migrants into rural Wales are out-and-out racists.*

**""Many English migrants into rural Wales"" /= ""The English""**

After all, he's English himself, and I hardly think he was calling himself a Nazi.

&gt;*“Their principal reason for leaving English cities was to get away from multicultural society, from black and Asian people in particular, and they see rural Wales, with its largely white population as a safe haven.”*

That's a fair question &amp; one he tried to answer (quite well I may add, I agree with him). 

Something else regarding interviews in general. Often journalists will phrase questions in a way to get a white or black responses (or where no answer is good). Especially when they're looking for yes or no answers. Then they get annoyed when politicians ""don't answer the question"" despite topics being more complicated &amp; not warranting such simple answers. You also have to bear in mind sometimes they don't have answers or if they do it's not what you want to hear. But they know if they say these things no one will vote for them. Sure we'd love an honest politician but we almost never see them because people don't vote for them.

With regards to the idea of promises from politicians. Two things I will say on that, firstly you cannot expect a party to keep their promises if they do not hold a majority in parliament. You need a majority in the commons to pass legislation (actually more than a majority incase people within your party rebel). If we end up with a minority government don't be surprised if their policies get watered down significantly. Secondly, the world isn't a static environment, what seems correct at one point in time can be disastrous at another. Not everything is going to be implemented exactly as promised, changes sometimes have to be made &amp; ideas scrapped entirely if need be. For me, when I look at a party manifesto I don't think ""this is what the party is promising to do"" I look at it as what they'd like to do in ideal circumstances.

There was a study IIRC during the referendum campaign asking if those who were voting yes actually trusted Salmond to deliver.

You could probably guess the outcome... The majority said no.

&gt;There's an opportunity to build some bridges now, and I hope (and suspect) that Sturgeon is a reflexive and intelligent enough politician to seize it. 

She is certainly talking the talk. She obviously wants a fairer deal for Scotland and rightly so but she seems to be wanting to help change the whole system for England, Norn, and Wales as well. The whole thing about the EU referendum and her wanting it to be fair and equal is something that I doubt Salmond would have played for if he didn't step down.

The only problem is that, come may 8th onwards, and she does pony up with Labour, will she go through with it all. When Ed agreed to extra austerity measures, a lot of supporters groaned.

Because I would have keep going back until they did, speaking with the same people. On the phone I can call until I'm blue in the face and speak to a different person every time. Simple stuff.




If the control room wouldn't deploy an officer, neither will the station office.

In fact, if you're at the station office, they're more likely not to on the basis that you're already there and they don't need someone to attend. The reason the police attend calls are a) to stop a crime in progress or b) take the report of a crime.

Actual deployment is a matter of policy. Some calls will get an immediate response, some will get an 'in an hour', some will get an 'eventually' and some will get no physical response at all. There are only so many coppers to go round. The met can state that if you want someone to come, they will come (for crime reporting purposes - they're pushing back on the non-crime, side, unless it's ""I've not seen Mrs Miggins for a week, the milk's piling up and I can see a load of flies in the window""), whereas other forces with single figure response teams covering vast distances might love to turn out, but simple arithmetic requires them to have a much stricter deployment policy. 

You can sit in the front office and report until you're blue in the face but if your crime report would not warrant deployment by phone, then it won't get deployed simply because you've turned up in person. You might find that a face to face conversation might turn an 'on the cusp' job if there's a bit of nuance to the whole thing, but it's hardly a guarantee.

Oh, and don't forget that the person staffing the front office won't a) make deployment decisions or b) be investigating the crime (unless you get lucky and the soon-to-be officer in the case happens to be covering the front office)

But yeah, it's clearly simple stuff.",null,0,null,1428514276,null,0,false,0,cq5jht8,null,t3_31v1el,null,t1_cq5jht8,null,t1_cq5gejb,null,null,null,1432270802,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The astonishing thing is that they've convinced the public that their key ideologies are not just desirable they're essential for our very survival, so much so that other parties must adopt them too. 

It's also why austerity cannot end - has it struck anyone that there has been no commitment to a date or value which when reached will trigger the repeal of all austerity policies and a return to previous levels of budget?

1. Cognitive biases in human psychology which make people predisposed to look for patterns and reasoning where none exists - [a book called Paranormality by Richard Wiseman goes into this topic and is a fascinating read.](http://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/aug/16/2)

2. Depending on the specifics of the belief system, uncontroversial aspects of scientific understanding (like evolution) are easily dismissed when people haven't been educated on them. I'm not saying that all religious people dismiss evolution etc.: I know that isn't the case. But failure to understand evolution [(no belief required)](http://www.theistic-evolution.com/hominids2_big.jpg) bolsters those religions which do dismiss it or purport that it isn't possible. [Religiosity is declining sharply in the young.](http://www.people-press.org/2012/06/04/section-6-religion-and-social-values/6-4-12-v-73/)

3. I don't expect you to take this very well, but [studies have shown 'a reliable negative relation between intelligence and religiosity'](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/religious-people-are-less-intelligent-than-atheists-according-to-analysis-of-scores-of-scientific-studies-stretching-back-over-decades-8758046.html)

4. [Inheritance of religion from family, and peer pressure issues surrounding this process, play a major role.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c-XoIwfLAM) Personally I was kicked out of the family home in part because I left my parents religion and in part because the way I wanted to live my life lay outside the 'moral' code of that religion. I could easily have kept my head down, continued to be involved in the religion, kept my family and home. I could have (and many people do) kept that lie up for the rest of my life. For me I had it relatively easy - mere excommunication. In some parts of the world, leaving the state religion is cause for execution. Not only is there a life or death religion to continue religious involvement, there's an extreme disincentive to study any literature which claims that the religion in question is false.

Religion will eventually fade to nothing, as living conditions around the world improve. [Sort the list on this page by percentage, from highest to lowest - the Gallup data is the most recent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_by_country).

&gt;CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

-I would say that he suffers from some mental lapses more than anything, sometimes losing his man on set pieces or getting caught ball watching. Otherwise his positioning is usually solid.

-I would definitely agree he needs to get stronger, because players like Costa bully him pretty easily.

I don't see Tonks as the ""anchor"" type of CB. He needs a Reid/Collins paired with him in order to succeed. He's the free-roaming CB, while the other stays home to clean up. The trouble is, the ""free roaming"" CB is the one who is supposed to be the enforcer, chasing people down and knocking them off the ball and such, and he's too weak to do that effectively.

The roads in the centre of Swansea are whole myriad of overlapping one-way systems and no right turns, the system used to moved quite slowly until the council decided the city needed bendy buses (a whole different story) and ripped it all up and put in a bendy bus friendly bus lane right through the heart of one of the cities busiest roads; the kingsway. 

The problem with the kingsway is simple, to the naked eye it looks like a dual carriageway, except one side is one way whilst the other is now a counterflow bus lane, approximately every 300 yards is a light controlled T-junction and/or and crossing. The majority of the crossing are very (and I mean *very* slow to react) so pedestrians don't get very far very fast and the traffic lights change so frequently that no car gets anywhere very fast. This leads to a great deal of frustration and a whole lot of jay-walking, and due to the one-way/counterflow nature of the road pedestrians forget to look both ways at the bus lanes. 

Now the council reacted by reducing the traffic speed limit to 20mph sighting safety (ignoring the fact that the nearly all serious incidents on the road occurred in the counterflow bus section, and were not related to speed). Their latest solution is to erect temporary barriers along the central reservation to discourage jay-walking, which is probably a better idea. However because of the poor utilisation of space (giving 50% of it to an under utilised bus lane) and the over-reliance on traffic lights the whole road system in Swansea has degraded to the ""madness"" OP describes, nobody (car, pedestrian *or* bus) gets anywhere very fast, for a journey from Tycoch to the Liberty Stadium at peak time it is probably faster to drive out to the M4 along and back in (about 3 times the distance), combine that with the fact there have been two deaths in recent years and you should be able to see where OP is coming from.",null,0,null,1428515607,null,0,false,0,cq5kf4x,null,t3_31vqmv,null,t1_cq5kf4x,null,t1_cq5glx1,null,null,null,1432272096,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

The roads in the centre of Swansea are whole myriad of overlapping one-way systems and no right turns, the system used to moved quite slowly until the council decided the city needed bendy buses (a whole different story) and ripped it all up and put in a bendy bus friendly bus lane right through the heart of one of the cities busiest roads; the kingsway.

The problem with the kingsway is simple, to the naked eye it looks like a dual carriageway, except one side is one way whilst the other is now a counterflow bus lane, approximately every 300 yards is a light controlled T-junction and/or and crossing. The majority of the crossing are very (and I mean very slow to react) so pedestrians don't get very far very fast and the traffic lights change so frequently that no car gets anywhere very fast. This leads to a great deal of frustration and a whole lot of jay-walking, and due to the one-way/counterflow nature of the road pedestrians forget to look both ways at the bus lanes.

Now the council reacted by reducing the traffic speed limit to 20mph sighting safety (ignoring the fact that the nearly all serious incidents on the road occurred in the counterflow bus section, and were not related to speed). Their latest solution is to erect temporary barriers along the central reservation to discourage jay-walking, which is probably a better idea. However because of the poor utilisation of space (giving 50% of it to an under utilised bus lane) and the over-reliance on traffic lights the whole road system in Swansea has degraded to a complete clusterfuck, nobody (car, pedestrian or bus) gets anywhere very fast, for a journey from Tycoch to the Liberty Stadium at peak time it is probably faster to drive out to the M4 along and back in (about 3 times the distance).",null,0,null,1428515854,null,0,false,0,cq5klbo,null,t3_31vqmv,null,t1_cq5klbo,null,t3_31vqmv,null,null,null,1432272178,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

His speed adds to WR/JC's defensive attributes and his distribution can open the pitch for our midfielders.

I would also agree that most of his shortcomings stem from mental lapses, but that's no small matter, particularly for a cb. At that level the mental part of the game is the single most important part of a players arsenal, and you've either got it or you don't. I don't see him pushing on to much higher a level if he cannot improve that focus. He's still relatively young at 26, but he has been around for a long time now. He'll be entering his prime years in the next couple of seasons. He should basically be the complete package by now.

Anyhow, I don't want to sound too critical. I like him and I think he's a good player to have in your squad.

&gt;patented seeds each year, locking them into dependence on the giant companies – just three of which control a staggering 70% of global seed sales.

First, the implication that farmers are in some sort of legal handcuffs or are dependent on GM seeds indefinitely is palpable nonsense, which is on the one hand surprising from someone who is so involved in agricultural interests, but then again not that surprising for someone who funds and promotes the organic industry, who have been specialising in some very underhand marketing tactics as of late.

Farmers don't save seed as a matter of course anyway. Subsequent generations are always a substandard quality and it is simply not economical to replant them if your livelihood relies on consistency. Complaining that farmers can't replant seeds as per a contract is like me complaining my employment contract forbids me from shagging the Queen: fine, it wasn't going to happen anyway.

[And his claim that the top three companies account for 70% of the market is simply false.](http://www.companiesandmarkets.com/News/Agriculture-Farming-Raw-Materials/Global-seed-market-dominated-by-Monsanto/NI6175) The latest figures I can find are 2012, but then the top three companies didn't even account for half the market (47%).",null,0,null,1428516411,null,0,false,0,cq5kz05,null,t3_31w94l,null,t1_cq5kz05,null,t3_31w94l,null,null,null,1432272357,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,lux_roth_chop,null,null,null,"In reality - that is to say outside the atheist echo chambers which are your only sources - we know a lot about the hard science of religion. 

Firstly we know that it is not invented or passed down by parents through indoctrination. In fact religious thought is universal to all healthy humans and we all use it almost from birth regardless of culture or upbringing. Read the 2013 meta study by trigg at Oxford; it compiled a huge number of sources which all showed this conclusion. 

It's actually atheism which is a later man made addition and entirely fabricated. This isn't a surprise to anyone familiar with the science either - we know from recent small scale studies at the university of Finland that hard line atheists who claim not to believe in any higher power routinely fail a simple test in which they dare the god they say doesn't exist to harm them or their families, showing exactly the same stress response as believers.

Again though that's expected; we know that religion is a universal and healthy trait and atheism is a later invention, which also explains the extreme hostility so many atheists display towards something they supposedly don't believe in. 

Lastly we know that religion has a physiological origin and cannot be explained as a simple delusion; this has been proven time and time again by persinger and others.

All of which leaves atheists in an interesting position. Since religion is a universal and healthy physical trait in all humans it must have evolved. But here's the rub: physical traits evolve in response to real phenomena; we have eyes because light exists.

null,false,strifeblood,null,null,null,"I watch both the Serie A and Bundesliga whenever I can so I don't buying the ""inferior league"" excuse. While Italian teams tend to not be as effective attacking, they are no joke defensively. From my experiences watching and hearing from fans, Serie A teams pride themselves on organized defense so it's not exactly a cake walk and it's often harder to break down a defense. The Bundesliga may not have a lot of parity in terms of the title race because Bayern is so stacked but overall the league is very competitive. Outside of a couple relegation teams, the German teams are very solid. Whether you want to admit it or not, Bayern would wreck the PL just like they do in the Bundesliga. 

Plus, the ""PL being a superior league"" doesn't really apply to Salah or Schurrle. They both played mostly cup games against weaker opposition or sub appearances usually against mid to bottom table teams. The only big games they played in were Schurrle for City away (where he scored) and Salah in the 5-3 loss to the Spurs. If it's really the opposition, then why did both of them look so shit regardless of what level they played? It has way more to do with them not getting playing time to get adjusted. Very few players can always be effective in limited appearances/minutes. The vast majority of players need to play a couple games together in order to be effective. Salah also did score in the Europa league against Spurs. Schurrle hasn't been banging in goals left and right, but he's been effective creating chances for his teammates either directing or indirectly so I'd say he's gaining form again. 

I never said Cahill didn't have serious weaknesses, I just said that he's been making more this year because he's been exposed much more often.

Threads can start to derail easier and maybe even go down in quality as the top comments are voted on by people of the community. They can still have a negative effect on the sub even if they follow mod rules (example, all the moffat hate, random click bait rumor articles)

I prefer gallifrey right now because it's small enough to only attact those who are interested in what it has to offer as opposed to the mass dw fanbase (which is by far my least favorite fanbase)

I mean just look at the episode discussion threads between the 2 subs when a new episode airs, not saying one is better than the other, but they are very different and I prefer gallifrey's.



Also the fact that there are a lot of casuals on this sub that tend to forget or not pickup on small details that would have answered their question or made their point redundant. Again, this isn't a which is better situation but these things can get annoying.

For example: During Death in Heaven, there were a ton of posts claiming that the ""Don't think you can open [the tardis doors] because it's locked"" line in the volcano scene is bad writing because Moffat forgot that the doc can just snap his fingers open.

Then the comments are something along the lines of:

* All a dream
* A set up by the doctor for clara
* The Doctor has several other ways of getting into a locked tardis, 8's tardis had a hidden key behind the ""P"" in POLICE
* this is the real world and every fan can't be expected to just instantly recall the fact that David Tennant did it that one time

null,false,andycycles,null,null,null,"&gt; They'll be driven much more efficiently, reducing pollution

Sorry, not true. This ignores the [fundamental law of traffic congestion](http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/transportation/fundamental-law-road-congestion-evidence-u-s-cities). When capacity is increased, by building bigger roads, using driverless cars or otherwise, usage increases over time (people have the option to commute further, socialise/shop more and so on), wiping out time savings within a few years by inducing more traffic. The level of congestion is simply set at whatever level people will tolerate before they choose to adjust their travel patterns: travelling less or making shorter journeys. You can look at places like Los Angeles with humongous motorways and there is still chronic severe congestion. So no, the rate of pollution will be increased by more cars travelling on the roads. Increased capacity **has never and never will** ""reduce pollution"", exactly the opposite I'm afraid.

This efficiency you speak of means eliminating and filling gaps between the cars - we've seen this in action already in computerised traffic signal networks such as in London, and what happens is people are unable to cross the road at all with a constant stream of endless cars!

[The Ranty Highwayman says:](http://therantyhighwayman.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/traffic-signal-pie-second-slice-scoot.html)
&gt; The trouble is, if pedestrians don't have a green man, then SCOOT can run so well, that opportunities to cross can become more difficult to come by. I have a junction on my journey to work which doesn't have green men/ bikes on the side roads (it's a shared-use cycle track) and sometimes, there is no decent gap between traffic stages which makes crossing more difficult.

---------------------------------------------------

&gt; A major advantage of computer-driven cars is that traffic jams and accidents will be hugely reduced

I agree, and welcome that. This however does not affect subjective safety and street quality, that is, for example: parents scared to let their kids play outside near traffic, the general population finding cycling in traffic far too dangerous, or pensioners too frightened to cross the road with so many cars passing by. Driverless cars do not solve these problems, only infrastructure to tame and restrain the motor car can.

We ought to be supporting cycling and walking as the greenest, most affordable and healthiest transport options. Our current roads and streets do the opposite: the car is king, and switching to driverless cars alone can't solve this, in some ways entrenching car dependency (""autoholism"") even further.

Even if you have electric cars, cycling is still far greener and [most UK trips are within reasonable cycling distance!](http://andytechcycle.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/how-much-scope-is-there-for-mass.html)",null,0,null,1428517158,null,0,false,0,cq5lh7t,null,t3_31r5dl,null,t1_cq5lh7t,null,t1_cq4l08x,null,null,null,1432272595,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Then she has a whole season of interesting character development and people flip over it not being about the Doctor anymore. 

Same with RTD and Moffatt. People hated RTD at the end of his time on the show, but now people are saying he's doing new episodes like he's going to save the show.

It's just so tiring seeing everyone complaining all the time. It gets to the point where I just don't want to involve myself with discussion of the show with anyone anymore, and that's just too bad. 

When did fandoms become about ONLY complaining about their favorite show? I would love to see more positive attitudes in the fandom.

1. The ground they're built on is soft and their foundations are not adequate. The whole complex is slowly subsiding. 

2. Despite being right next to the sea, the developers didn't see fit to use marine grade fixtures and fittings, so expect everything on the outside to be rusted/rusting to fuck.

3. The Firth of Forth is pretty damn windy. Living in a large structure stuck right out on a point like that is going to drive your heating costs up, particularly if your windows etc are rusted to fuck.

4. **You're right in the middle of a busy commercial port**. One that's active 24 hours a day. Not a quaint little touristy port that might still have one or two darling little fishing boats amongst its flotilla of pleasure craft, but a proper industrial beast of a thing that loads and unloads shittons of industrial stuff.  All the fucking time. You'll have huge boats setting their horns off and assailing you with your exhaust fumes (which can be strong enough to set fire alarms off in doors, I speak from personal experience having worked in a nearby building) as they maneuver in and out. 24 hours a day. And you'll have all the noise from the cranes and lorries etc. Every fucking day. It's not always loud, but when it is... Well, when you're lying awake at three in the morning while some arsehole uses a crane to drop boulders the size of transit vans into a ships hold, or some such fuckery, and you grab the phone to complain to the port authority, you'll be directed through a labyrinthine phone network in the most tedious way possible until eventually you reach whoever's been left in charge of the control room that night, who may be someone I know personally. They'll then have to tell you, as nicely as they can, as they have had to tell hundreds of others, that no, there is nothing they can do about it, really, there is nothing, whilst reminding you as politely as possible that you're the stupid cunt who decided it'd be a great idea to live inside a commercial port. 

5. If you're looking for somewhere with any sense of community, you're going to be disappointed. For the above reasons few if any of the locals will have anything to do with the place.

There is quite a surge towards fossil fuels at the moment with all the f**cking going on in the USA pulling the price down. I'm not convinced about electric cars becoming mainstream any time soon: we are pumping so much money into fossil fuel vehicles, a lot of which is used to fund research that improves combustion engine performance and efficiency further. The combustion engine will remain more developed and thus at any specific point in time ""better"" than electric vehicles (cost, range, convenience, etc), so people will stay with petrol and diesel cars. It's a vicious circle as far as I can see.

&gt; division of communities for other modes

I'm talking about [this.](http://goo.gl/maps/X9trN). Major roads to accommodate more and more cars form barriers between communities. In this particular example the only way to cross the A127 (a 70mph motorway pretty much) is this big roundabout junction with no pedestrian/cycle crossings whatsoever. The A406 North Circular Road in London is another good example. Unless we take walking and cycling seriously and build proper crossings of major roads (and rivers, railways, etc) for them, these barriers remain a significant barrier to the goal of sustainable transport.

About safety, see my reply to taliswolf.

&gt; Unfortunately, a huge proportion of people in this country need their cars

Some people do, but most people don't. If you [look at the statistics](http://andytechcycle.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/how-much-scope-is-there-for-mass.html), 38% of **all** UK journeys are under 2 miles in length. A whole 67% are 5 miles or less. You can cycle 2 miles in 12 minutes, and 5 miles in 30 minutes.

Started 29 years ago for me. I was 11, liked a kickabout and was brought up on blue side of Bristol but Dad was a bit shite so never went to games etc. Was waiting to be claimed...

...then I saw the 86 final on TV. I was mesmerised by the fans, the singing, the atmosphere. It bewitched me. There was something immediate about the team in Red that spoke to me that day before the game had kicked off. Them scoring first couldn't stop me being fascinated with the football from the men in Red. 2nd half, Rush became my instant hero.

From then, that was it for me. I went to see Rovers locally but they just never got into my soul the way Liverpool did. Over the next 3 years it became irreversible. I was stunned after Hillsborough - too young to really grasp it but still felt it - and inconsolable after 'that' Thomas goal. First time I ever cried at football. I also remember staying up to see that 5-0 against Forest on MOTD and realising on some level ""well, this is it for life now"".

And it has been. No cash, illness &amp; distance mean I've only ever made it to Anfield once (an inglorious 1-0 vs Watford) but I can't wait to make it back. Any way I can see a game on TV, online, radio I do - missing one is unthinkable to me, whatever the medium.

Last summer I turned 40 and decided it time to have a tattoo - one of those 'midlife' things I guess, just to know I could.

at the moment it seems by religion, all you mean is, the sad inclination the mental software of most humans has towards lazy explanations of the universe. 

that you desperately try to warp science to add some credence to your pathetic argument is ~~hilarious~~ tragic. just stick to 'herpy derpy i have faith', it's far less duplicitous.

edit: quick search on the oxford study: (it's not science is blasted theology weakly posing as social science)

[""Now, guess who funded Trigg and Barrett’s religion study at Oxford? They were given 1.9 million pounds for it. I’ll give you one try, and if you can’t get it in one guess, you haven’t been reading this website. Yes, that particular organization paid two million pounds to find out the obvious: religion is pervasive. But what it was really buying was the researchers’ claim that pervasiveness implies permanence—and perhaps correctness.""](https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/05/13/new-oxford-study-religion-pervasive-this-impossible-to-eradicate/)

funders in question: info on 'the templeton foundation':

[Its aim in practice appears to be to corrupt the public discourse concerning science in the interests of religion, by swaying academics with much more money than they'd get any other way. Anything or anyone funded by Templeton should be viewed in this light. Of late, they have expanded beyond religion to funding climate change denial.](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Templeton_Foundation)

notice how i linked to a few things there. you should try it chickenshit.

really don't think they got much value for their $4000000, unless dragging the name Oxford University further through the mud, was their goal:

Ah I dunno, I've never really had a major problem with learning lines (and this also isn't the first one-man play I've ever done - I performed ""A Night in November"" a number of years ago). 

I have a few techniques, I sometimes record myself saying the lines and then listen to it back when I'm out and about, but there is no substitute for just saying the lines out loud over and over again. 

The best advice I've ever gotten on line learning is not to learn the lines but to learn the thoughts. So don't try and just learn every line by heart, but learn why the character is saying those lines. So he says this line, which reminds him of this other thing which makes him angry which causes him to say the next line. That way, even if you forget the exact wording it's a lot harder to have a full on memory blank. 

As for how Oisín is directing me - I'll tell him to get onto answering this, but from myside it's been a lot of discussions on character and story and what we want to bring out at different times.

I'm not offended. I'm saying that the priveleges afforded to someone *one the basis of religion* should be afforded to anyone, because as I told you, we should not discriminate on the grounds of religion or none. You're the one apparently offended by someone wanting the same thing they have.


Article 9 of the european convention of human rights, of which the UK is bound to obey:

&gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.

&gt;Freedom to **manifest** one's religion **or beliefs** shall be **subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety**, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Emphasis mine. Nothing about denying people the same rights religious people have, in fact the total opposite. There is something about denying people things when there is a clear need to, though.

But now should Scotland democratically vote for a party that - just like Labour - wants to lock the Tories out of government, it's a 'middle finger to the democratic wishes of much of England'.

As for the oil predictions, nobody was lying, no one could predict the colossal crash in oil prices. If you're going to say that the SNP were lying about oil prices you have to be consistent and say that the UK Deparment of Energy and Climate Change was lying too, perhaps lying more so since their predictions were $10 higher than the SNP's! I would say that the SNP's prediction was probably the most sensible since it was in between the OBR's and the Deparment of Energy's. (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-31967538).

Also they have not once during this election campaign discussed another referendum without being questioned about it, so the idea that 'they won't shut up about it' is a bit ridiculous.

&gt; BUT. With Clara, her personality seems to shift to match each story.

Parent: 

&gt; Can you provide examples?

Well, I would say... the one episode that spells it out for me more than any other is ""Time Heist"" - the episode where they pull a bank heist.  In a lot of episodes, they morph Clara to be whatever the story demands for that episode, but in Time Heist, you can see that even that idea didn't work, because the story didn't need her.  

It felt like they had to put Clara in that story because she's the companion, but she had *no reason* to be in the story.  As in, if you were sitting down to write that plot, and you weren't given a pre-set list of characters that, contractually, had to be in the episode, you wouldn't have put her there.

There was:  the Doctor (""The Architect"" / mastermind behind the heist).  There was the cyborg Psi, who was needed because of his computational ability.  There was the shapeshifter Saibra, who was there so that she could shape shift and become who she needed to be.  And there was Clara, who literally did nothing.  A vestigial appendage, there to smile at the camera.

That's what I don't like about her.  It's like somewhere, someone made the decision that we needed this companion, but every time they go to write a non-Clara-centric story, she is just tacked on, and could have been anyone.   Where they were on the Submarine?  Yes, she ""did important plot things"" - but it didn't have to be *HER* doing them, it could have been anyone.  That sort of thing has happened a lot since she's been a companion, but it's been especially bad since Capaldi took over.  And then, when they write Clara-centric episodes, they seem ... either trite, or overly sappy, or just ... bad.  

I also agree with my sibling post that anything interesting in Clara's life seems to happen off-screen.  She's one thing, and then she needs to be another thing, so the transformation from A to B happens off screen, and then when the next episode starts, she's magically B.  If you don't *see* the transformation, it's just flippy-floppy nonsense, and has no gravitas.",null,0,null,1428519536,null,0,false,0,cq5n4ix,null,t3_31umeo,null,t1_cq5n4ix,null,t1_cq5itj1,null,null,null,1432273372,null,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5,null

Our salaries are expected to go up, our expenses are minimal, and we've got no plans for kids, so we'd be okay with a rate increase.

Longer fixed deals are a higher interest rate to start with, so it makes more sense for us to get a shorter fixed deal while our incomes are lower, and leave the higher interest rates til later, when our incomes will be higher.

I tried, I really did. I even went away and did some research. But I can't find any policies that I believe don't have an alternative motive. I'm sorry. 

But I do think Farage was right to call for asylum for Syrian refugees.  

4) SNP

As I've said elsewhere, I find the passion in nationalist parties like the SNP and Plaid utterly amazing. That passion should be reflected in politics across the board. 

5) Greens

I think the Greens are in the right frame of mind for many of their policies, and with some serious work put in by their policy makers, they could be on to something. 

I honestly don't think that I could run for another party, as none really fit with my viewpoints. If hard pushed though, and I really need to answer, I could see myself voting toward the Plaid/ Green area.

I think devolution could be dangerous, and that whilst some further devolving of certain powers may be beneficial, the suggestion you outlined above, could be a step too far and result in a fractured UK.

So whilke we would like to reflect this in their metrics we cannot unless they tell us (and yes we did contact every MP back before we launched allowing them the opportunity to let us know if they felt any of the information about them was inaccurate as well as allowing them to make a short unedited statement that we would be happy to publish on their profile page).

For gentlepersons agreements where 2 MPs simply agree not to attend a specific vote - we would count in both cases that neither voted (which is how its recorded)  a fair reflection.

I was 19 and my mind was in other places as I probably had the emotional maturity of 13 year old. I went down a hill that I drove down nigh on every day with a very obvious speed/redlight combo camera at the bottom of it. Everyone knew it was there and it was at a cross roads, it was so obvious I can't believe people got caught by it....

So of course, I, with my head in other places, see the lights are red, slow down. I then notice the turn right filter light changing to green, and because I'm stupid, think that it is the normal green light. I accelerate slightly (to 16mph, as I later found out) and cruise accross the crossroads, clearly being snapped by the camera as the red light had been on for 34seconds. 

Amazingly I didn't hit anyone/nobody hit me. Then got taken to court as it was past the threshold for an automatic fine... where I was promptly presented with my evidence photo.... I'll just leave this here to show you quite how not with it I was that day.....

Foreign tourists to the UK 
Number of visits in 2013 - 32.813 million
Cost to NHS - £30 million.
Cost per person ~ £0.91

UK Tourists abroad in 2013 - 58.509 million (from here - http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ott/overseas-travel-and-tourism---monthly-release/provisional-results-for-january-2015/tsd--january-2015.html)
Cost to foreign health systems - £155 million
Cost per person ~£2.65

Then take into account different cultures, laws etc. which may result in accidents being more likely abroad than here, plus the exorbitant cost of healthcare in some other countries (like the US), and you may get other reasons for the difference,

Also the article mentions the cost being 5 times higher, yet never mentions that it's actually only around 3 times higher when you also consider the number of tourists and add that to the equation.

* Everyone over 30 out, if possible, with the exception of Zabaleta, perhaps. Maybe even some of the 29 year olds. Toure, Sagna, and Dzeko to be sold. I'd want Demichelis gone too but he's signed that extension. That leaves a central midfield spot, a RB and a striker spot up for grabs and will bring in some funds to fill them. 

* Follow up those sales with some of the players lagging behind a bit. Jovetic would follow the above, although I'd like to see him have another chance in a different system. I'd like Milner to stay but I think he's already off out. Scott Sinclair, Fernando and even Samir Nasri would be off, at least if I was in charge. I'd actually consider letting Caballero go too, in favour of a man I'll bring up later.

* We've got a fantastic academy, lets showcase it. Rekik, Marcos Lopes, Pozo and Guidetti, all promoted to the first team. They don't have to start, but they would be getting games. I'd like to see how Rekik manages alongside Kompany or Mangala, giving him the experience to take over if needs be. But someone more stable will be required for that. And I think Guidetti could take the role of third striker, with Pozo fourth choice. Marcos Lopes could take Samir's role. 

* As for signings, lets not go nuts. Full backs, central defender, central midfielder, attacking midfielder and maybe a striker. Nathaniel Clyne in that RB slot. Zabaleta's getting on, and I think Clyne would fit in well. For that LB spot, ideally I'd like Ricardo Rodriguez, but going a little more realistically, I'll target Aaron Cresswell. Doesn't have to usurp Gael, but can do a good job and would be reasonably cheap. I don't necessarily think we need to shell out on a central defender, so I'm going to take a punt on someone potentially available on a free in Andrea Ranocchia. Not the youngest, but younger than the majority at the club. In midfield, my heart says Arturo Vidal or Pogba, but my head is saying Jordan Henderson. English, playing damn well right now and I think he would work well in the midfield, perhaps alongside Fernandinho. Playing alongside Silva in my team would be De Bruyne or Coutinho, with Marcos Lopes slotting in now and then. Up front, again, not going too overboard. We have Aguero, we spent big money on Bony who I believe will come good. Lets go young, lets go English. Lets go Charlie Austin. Guidetti and Pozo can provide ample cover. Finally, that potential keeper replacing Caballero. Whilst Willy hasn't done anything wrong, I'd rather maybe keep him in the Richard Wright role and bring in Sergio Romero on a free. Nothing special, but handy.

Still looking to shift responsibility I see.

Cases like yours are why the reassessments and shooing people off benefits is a good thing, you may not think you can do anything, until you are forced to. And then you will wonder what all the fuss was about.

So you just gave up on the princes trust after one phone call? 

Dont waste you time or a space. If you cant be bothered to sort yourself out with free money you wont stick the course. 

You could make a grand a week as a taxi driver or 10ph as a forklift truck driver or if your are technologically inclined get on alibaba and go round houses offering to install reversing cameras in peoples cars, or mushrooom picking/figh gutting? anything that pays piece rate can be a good way to make cash fast.

Learn on here to code, there are a bunch of great communities. Sounds like you need to get out, join some clubs and volunteer. Woodland trust is good. Meet some people get fresh air. 

What wont help is being a penis to people. We just finishing a draw drawn in a long mess of military conflict, plenty people know about PTSD. Look around at all the people older than you, lost their parents, friends, some have buried their children after they were silly a burnt them selves to death. You are not a special snowflake, your life is not insurmountably difficult. You can and most probably will be in a  much better place in 12 months.

If you think it is, rack up as much in loans s you can and fuck off back packing, maybe have  a gander at the impoverished slums in s. america and get some perspective.  

Do something, anything. If it works,keep doing it, if it doesn't, do something else.

Balotelli is constantly 'ill' or 'injured' whether that's because he decided not to play like v arsenal or due to the fact Rodgers is chosing not to play him ot probably a combination of both. 

Also some of the games Balo hasn't tried at all such as the Basel game where he didn't touch the ball in the opponents box once. Plus there is the fact he put a couple of ambiguous videos on instagram which may be interpreted as him having a go at Rodgers which if it was it absolutely disgraceful.

In any case, my point was that Rafa didn't have a unified footballing philosophy conducive to youth players breaking into the first team. He changed the side a lot match to match, selection to selection, year to year. This type of flexibility does very well for results, when the person doing it is tactically astute, but it's going to make it very difficult for a youth player to break through and consistently get games since they will be changing their role frequently and won't be able to specifically train in a role throughout their academy career.",null,0,null,1428521597,null,0,false,0,cq5oj2h,null,t3_31rd51,null,t1_cq5oj2h,null,t1_cq5ltf3,null,null,null,1432274033,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

Assuming this was dealt with in the magistrates court this would have been dealt with in open session and you should have been informed of when and where (but cases were probably dealt with in bulk). 

If you had attended court you would have had an opportunity to fill out a means form, which may have mitigated your fine level. The magistrates will also have had to follow guidance with regards to what to penalise you with (in that, as you pleaded guilty, there would be no room to manoeuvre other than on fine level via means as the magistrates would be following policy guidance).

As a criminal case, had you pleaded not guilty, this would have proceeded to trial and the prosecution would have had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that you were driving without due care and attention (because it's a criminal, not civil offence, the burden of proof is set higher). Obviously this may have then incurred extra fees for you (court costs etc) but if you had reason to believe you were not guilty, it may have been worth it. 

For details of your case you will need to contact the relevant magistrates court which dealt with the case, who will be able to provide you with further details.

I'm really sorry it turned out like this for you.

EDIT: I just read up - you 100% don't have to pay all your fine in one go (they just say that to try and get the money quickly) you can absolutely do it over a period of time. If you genuinely can't afford to pay all at once, you can set up a payment plan. Just make sure you do eventually pay it, or you could end up back in court for non-payment of a court registered fine.

The problem is that a lot of the issues with practical applications of GMO are social and political due to their use in the developing world, and often not that much about the science. 

It's difficult to comment on the subject from a developed world perspective without understanding more the complexities of the situation at hand for farmers in developing countries, and thus any time this topic comes up on reddit it's never really going to get a fair or equal hearing as it's far more complex than a few comments will make up for. 

GMO is scientifically good, but equally there are drought resistance farming methods etc that exist within indigenous communities already, but that get supplanted through well meaning NGOs that assume they know best. 

Only in the recent decade or so have people really been stopping to consider the impacts of such policy and the fact that local farmers who have been successfully farming the same land for centuries may know what they are doing, and that replacing their crops with monocultures and suddenly they are all starving perhaps isn't the best plan. 

From an environmental PoV, it's just another technocentric-rush to try and solve the problem, rather than prevent the cause in the first place.

And no, I can't source all of this. I've done so in the past and very rarely does any of it get listened to and people just shoot down those sources.

null,false,OhHiGCHQ,scot-Lothian,Lothian,null,"&gt;A UKIP parliamentary candidate in Newcastle upon Tyne says that cyclists are ‘the chosen people’, while motorists are simply ‘a cash cow’.

Regular cyclist here, if we spent even a tenth of what we spend on roads for private car use on cycling we'd have a cycle system that would give Copenhagen and Amsterdam a run for their money. I mean seriously, the idea of the ""poor, neglected motorist"" is bullshit, for the last fifty to sixty years we've built everything around the car and only in the last decade have we seriously started building things for Bicycles and public transport. The car has become the centre for transport in the UK and it's not always been for the better with massive traffic jams, the endless need to improve or upgrade the road for cars, and pollution. We have to completely rejigger our countryside and city just to keep things moving. 

In cities and towns, the endless need to accommodate cars have lead to the very type of traffic nightmares we all complain about. Park and Ride schemes seem to do nothing (if someone can show me otherwise on that point, please do, I can only think of one place where that isn't the case). The simple fact is that cities and cars don't mix, not unless you demolish half the city for expressways. Cars are great for short to medium haul journeys, town to town journeys and the like but as a form of city transport they just don't work. Public transport, cycling and making cities walkable is the best way, If done right, and it can be done right, we could reduce car journeys and make it easier to get around.

And before anyone says ""BUT I NEED MY CAR TO GET AROUND THE CITY"". I didn't say ""get rid of cars everywhere"", just that we need to rethink our relationship to the car and work to improve our cities and towns transport wise.",null,0,null,1428523760,null,0,false,0,cq5q00d,null,t3_31vqel,null,t1_cq5q00d,null,t3_31vqel,null,null,null,1432274728,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

I have not ruled out democracy. I said that that which is labelled democracy (ie the system in which we live) is not democracy at all since the general population have no say in what goes on. 

I would recommend something like anarcho syndicalism, to avoid having to be more long winded at this time of night. Small communities, abolition of private property and direct democracy to arrive at a consensus. Perhaps abolition of money could work and certainly abolition of profits. All enterprises run cooperatively. No more externalities. 

&gt;I can't argue the point either, however I don't really care if they were truly communist or not. The whole idea is unworkable in my opinion, and leaves people far less free (either politically or economically) than the present system.

We are incredibly unfree in this system. Thinking you have any freedom at all is idiotic. I'm not even free to hope the ecosystem will still be able to sustain life a few generations from now. 

&gt;Since you're advocating a system close to if not exactly communist, I'd imagine it would make at least interesting reading. I found it a bit heavy going after a while.

Maybe I'll get around to reading it one day but those academically inclined people who I've heard speaking of Das Kapital and whatnot make it sound like no fun at all. I'll stick to other reading for now.

&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy](Wikipedia) has a few different (and long winded) definitions - is what you mean closer to consensus democracy?

I'm sure the formal definitions are varied. So it's best to avoid them and just try to put it myself. A system of rule by the people would enable the general population to arrive at a consensus on how their society should work and make it happen. 

As far as the system we have now, if there is no way to change the basic structure of things then the best solution I have is that the government should be entirely chosen by lotto.

It is not when talking about transfer fees. Longer contracts mean higher transfer fees and when there're a couple of years involved that will add a significant premium.

Jan didn't sign a new contract last summer.... but he is contracted until 2018.

He has played several games in the beginning of the year and has looked mediocre at best, bar the derby game. Against sporting he was getting smoked over and over by Carillo, constantly being left for dead. Against newcastle he was getting twisted inside out by cabella. Against hull recently he failed to track his man properly which led to their first goal. I can't remember what game it was, but in one particular game he was so bad that people in the match thread on this sub were calling for his substitution. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Brana is perfect, he's far from it. But its not like Luis has been this magical answer to our problems at the back. He isn't the same player he was at Atleti. Furthermore our weakness in set pieces would be further weakened if Brana sits out, he's important in set pieces. 

With that being said I don't agree with Mourinho for starting brana over luis against weaker teams, I think luis should play against teams like leicester but Brana starts in the big games because he is a big game player. He just seems to step up his game immensely in big games. Sanchez had to start paying rent for the space he took in brana's pocket, Di Maria didn't even get a sniff at goal. Not only that but he scores in big games, he's got the instinct.

null,false,JakeSpleen,null,null,null,"for some reason i find that story strangely touching. 

probably the alcohol. good story OP, we have the best fans,  we really do. 

Anyway even though I'm late in going to share my story:

Grew up in South Wales and always just kind of supported Liverpool.  My earliest football memory is catching a glimpse of them on TV.  It was the late 80's and I was in my friends living room, I was about 5 or 6 and Liverpool were on  TV.  No idea who they were playing and the only player I can remember playing was Grobelaar.

Anyway my next footballing memory is watching us win the league cup in 1990, and then the FA cup in 1992. I was a fan by then,  I watched both games in my nans living room on my Todd. There was a moment in the FA cup final that's always stuck with me,  no not Mcmanaman's performance but afterwards when one of the Bolton players asked one of ours (Babb?) if he could touch the cup.  I'll always remember that. 

I've been a handful of times over the years,  Rushy's last game,  Mark Kennedy's debut before that,  3-0 win over Spurs under Rafa  and most recent Carra's last game with my little bro,  we won  a raffle  on the bus on the way back and he had a choice of signed pictures,  Saunders or Downing; He didn't know who Saunders was !!

Although I don't go as often as I should I class myself as pretty dedicated. I rarely miss any game,  during the H and G era I boycotted club merchandise and bought a fan made protest shirt,  too many people grumbled about the owners at that time but continued to buy club merchandise, the owners didn't care about the club,  only money and it grated  with me when so called fans kept putting money in their pockets.

If you have a [Salvation Army](http://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/) church nearby, they would also be able to help. 

£400 a month rent is about average for the Leeds area but have you checked out [Gumtree](http://www.gumtree.com/), [SpareRoom](http://www.spareroom.co.uk/), and [RightMove](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/) for cheaper rooms? You should be able to get a single room in a shared house for pretty cheap. 

And secondly, I gather that you're from the USA. Can I ask how you managed to get a VISA with so little money..? Or are you VISA exempt through ancestry or something?

I agree with you - the supervision system, in which undergraduates have limited focused contact time with academic staff who have barely any training, and have no formal feedback or assessment of their teaching, really shouldn't work.

Which is not the case. It is them who exclude themselves from education (they try to avoid sending their kids to school so they can work or beg). Btw, the Roma in my country (Macedonia) are settled, they don't move around like before, so that's no excuse.

Source: Was a teacher, had a 5th grade Roma class with 19 pupils, 5 pupils attended on average. Only one was a good student. There were a few that couldn't even read or write at all and couldn't care less. 

&gt;and then employment opportunities

That's true, but it's a vicious cycle. Why would someone hire you if you only have a fourth grade education and can't even read and write properly?

Don't get me wrong, I don't place all the blame on them. Is it true that they are subject to racial prejudices? Yes, absolutely. Is it true that most of them are not thieves and beggars and would just like a decent job? Yes, that's true, too.

While a generalisation I think it is a fair one. They are by and large, optimistic. And this is reflected in the comedy they produce. Their comedians act like they are a step above their compatriots, direct, happy, and very rarely actually mock the subject using anything beyond, I guess, a wisecrack.

We, do not share this. Our humour is almost bathed in disappointment, downtroddeness and failure. Our best comedians act like underdogs.

So when it comes to newsertainment satire, we do not go out of our way to explain a concept. We expect the subject is known, and already awarded  with a sense of powerlessness to change it.

So when John goes out of his way to make this a campaign, he is already approaching it with a sense of optimism (like a real American). Like he can do something. Like all it will take is to reach more people and that can be done through simplification and laughter. And in the US, that may well work.

Did you not research the living costs before moving, and create a budget plan and a worse-case-scenario plan? The UK has the highest cost of living in the entirety of Europe, especially with youth employment being particularly high here at the moment.

I am sorry to sound cruel and harsh but I have to agree with this sentiment. Regardless of the circumstance of how you got to the UK, how on earth did you envisage supporting yourself? Moving halfway across the world isn't just something you do over a weekend for fun, and now you've found yourself up shit creek you're basically left with only the option of seeking charity from others or contacting groups like Shelter to help you out.

But they aren't going to have to pay for all of them, if they get 10% of their policies through (or actually considerable less), that would be a success, and then the issue isn't money, finding 10% of the money they want isn't unreasonable, it is the complete social change that is the problem for some of their policies.

 &gt; outside the atheist echo chambers which are your only sources

A photograph of archaeological evidence, the results of over fifty scientific studies and a simple cross-referencing of demographic data, including the IHDI which does not include religion in any of its metrics in any way shape or form, are not sources from 'an atheist echo chamber'.

&gt; Firstly we know that it is not invented or passed down by parents through indoctrination. 

Doctrine certainly is invented and passed down through indoctrination. That's why no distinct and separate groups (civilisations, tribes etc.) have ever converged on the same creation story or other doctrines. There are often common features, typically derived from meteorological and astronomical phenomena - sun worship, fear of eclipses, thunder as representative of divine anger, etc. I said that humans were predisposed to pattern-finding, superstitious thought myself. 

&gt; In fact religious thought is universal to all healthy humans and we all use it almost from birth regardless of culture or upbringing. 

'In which the religious apologist infers that all irreligious people are somehow diseased or otherwise lesser, and any who claim to be happy or healthy are deluded or liars'. Oldest one in the book, that. There are hundreds of millions of irreligious people. As I said, we tend to be concentrated in highly developed countries, with high standards of living and access to education, and in which life expectancies are high.

I can't pretend that there is a definitive answer for the origin of religion - there isn't and I'd be disingenuous to say otherwise. It's difficult to research the behaviour of our long dead ancestors. The two main schools of thought are roughly 1. That religion offers advantages in social cohesion in hominids, rewarding supposed pro-group behaviour and punishing anti-group behaviour [(cost-signalling theory)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle), or 2. That religion is an [exaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaptation) (something which evolved for one purpose and came to serve another, like birds' feathers) or 'spandrel' (a 'side effect') of psychological processes like [agent detection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_detection). Animals benefit from assuming that they are in danger, even without clear evidence - it's better to be wrong and alive than make the opposite assumption (that they are safe) and get eaten. 

Your assertion that we use 'religious thought' is untrue, because a religion is a specific contained body of beliefs. As I said, specific doctrines don't develop convergently and are only passed on through evangelism. The aforementioned animal skittishness, though, could be manifesting itself in us. It would have served a clear benefit if we were at risk of being eaten by a sabre toothed tiger. Now it makes children scared of (often elaborately conceived) monsters under their bed. Whilst I'm on the subject of childhood beliefs, consider the examples of Santa and the tooth fairy. Though no adult seriously claims that they genuinely exist, they share many of the properties of a deity. They are invisible and intangible. They reward those who behave well, and punish those who don't. Children believe in them quite readily most of the time. Evolutionarily, it benefits children to believe what they are told with little resistance - that is how information crucial to survival is passed on.

&gt; Read the 2013 meta study by trigg at Oxford; it compiled a huge number of sources which all showed this conclusion. 

I don't think Trigg et. al. would agree with your use of the phrase 'healthy humans'. Their study, at any rate, is only further evidence for the predisposition of humans to have certain thought patterns, something which isn't in question. It doesn't claim that this sort of thought is healthy, nor does it demonstrate that there is any non-evolutionary basis for those thought patterns. People are predisposed towards many, many things which we as a society rightly reject, [like racism](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/racism-is-hot-wired-into-the-human-brain/story-e6frg8y6-1226409560164).

&gt; It's actually atheism which is a later man made addition and entirely fabricated. This isn't a surprise to anyone familiar with the science either - we know from recent small scale studies at the university of Finland that hard line atheists who claim not to believe in any higher power routinely fail a simple test in which they dare the god they say doesn't exist to harm them or their families, showing exactly the same stress response as believers.

Your 'later invention' claim is fallacious. To refer back, 'not being a racist' is a pretty recent invention too. I would like to see the study to which you refer, if you care to provide it.

&gt; Again though that's expected; we know that religion is a universal and healthy trait 

*A predisposition to superstition* is universal. Religion is not proven to be healthy.

&gt; and atheism is a later invention, which also explains the extreme hostility so many atheists display towards something they supposedly don't believe in. 

Atheist hostility to religion isn't based on fear, secret deep-down belief, our brains being hardwired to recognise the sovereignty of Jesus or any number of any other absurd claims. It stems from two, very simple principles.

1. Antipathy towards the harm religion can do.

2. Frustration towards and resent of harms done to oneself in the name of religion.

I speak out against religion because it harmed me, and because I do not want others to be harmed. That is the sum total of it. 

You go off on one with more gibberish here about how religion is healthy and I'm just going to skip that because I've already addressed it.

&gt; But here's the rub: physical traits evolve in response to real phenomena; we have eyes because light exists. Atheists are left shrieking that light is a delusion invented by people with eyes and they'd all be better off closing their eyes and pretending to be blind

This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of evolutionary physiology and psychology. If you do care to read up on this stuff, it's all very fascinating. The link to exaptation is a good starting place. In an unending evolutionary process where all life is shaped through the combination of environmental circumstances and mutations with a fortunate or unfortunate effect on survival in those circumstances, a *lot* of junk gets left behind in species after species. In all mammalian species we have the [left recurrent laryngeal nerve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve). This nerve takes a detour into our chests, around our aortic arch and back up into the larynx. This is a major disadvantage. Not only is there no reason for it to do that, in its greatly extended length (and it follows the same route in giraffes) comes a hugely greater potential for damage. Horses get a disease that *specifically affects this overly long nerve*. The point in mentioning this is to illustrate that even though something might occur in humans, that doesn't mean at all that it has a beneficial purpose or is a response to anything currently present in our environmental circumstances. In fact, the course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve makes perfect sense in fish, who retain it to this day, and their ancestors, which are our ancestors too.

For me it was the worst accom I ever had and the same went for my flatmates. within a month the toilet was always clogged and the university could do nothing about it due to the structure of the building. So we were given a bucket to fill with water and flush down the toilet. by the second semester we had rats. 

I guess the worst thing about the accom was the lack of security especially in the back yard which actually led to a burglary in my flat and our neighbors. I don't know if they've done a better job this year or not but listening to freshers who are living there this year, they seem to find it pleasant. so I guess I was just unlucky in my case. 

location wise it is really good, its a 10min walk to the library, 15min walk to bristo square/potterow/teviot. 30min walk to kings buildings but the campus bus stops at a nearby bus stop on buccleuch st which is 3mins away. 

Its also v. close to nicholson st where there is an oriental market, tescos (10-15mins), sainsburys (5mins)

lots of buses actually go by nicholson st so its easy to get around places. but you can pretty get around anywhere within 30minutes walking. ",null,0,null,1428528302,null,0,false,0,cq5t2sg,null,t3_31w4o8,null,t1_cq5t2sg,null,t3_31w4o8,null,null,null,1432276246,null,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1,null

&gt; By placing trafficked people in debt bondage, or by exploiting their vulnerable status in a country in which they now live illegally and often without knowledge of local language, traffickers are able to force those who have been trafficked into activities in which they would not otherwise engage.

&gt; The Government should grant a temporary right to stay in the country to anyone who has been trafficked or appears to have been trafficked.

&gt; Such an application should not be affected by the illegal nature of the trafficked person&amp;#039;s original residence in the UK. Consideration of any criminal activities by a trafficked person should include consideration of whether they were performed under duress as a victim of trafficking.

null,false,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,null,"Pretty much. I'm an EU citizen now, but since I was a young teen I've lived in the UK as a non-EU citizen. I'm often disheartened by changes to immigration policy and some of the more recent changes made by the coalition government, particularly to spouse visa rules and the cancelling of post-study work permits, were something that I thoroughly objected to.

However, in terms of actually 'fixing' the UK's immigration system, which is actually fairly robust, I've been saying for years that reintroducing exit checks is one of the best things that could be done to crack down on illegal immigration. Until this point, *all* figures regarding how many illegal migrants were in the country are mere guesses. There was absolutely no way to know who had or hadn't overstayed unless they perhaps went to apply for a visa later on and some piece of evidence happened to surface that put them in the UK after their previous expiry, or the Home Office had received a tip from someone.

If they were able to integrate the border control terminals with an electronic visa issuance system, the benefits would be even more robust. People would be flagged as overstayers immediately upon crossing the exit checks, without the need to manually count up how many days they spent in the UK. Older people on this sub will remember that exit checks existed before 1998, as they were one of the first things scrapped by Tony Blair's government.

I really don't understand both this sub and the UK public in general. This is an actual good, solid and robust policy that will actually give the UK a fighting chance to catch overstayers, rather than their current system of just going to fishing expeditions and relying on public tipoffs, but suddenly this is a terrible policy? What exactly *should* be done, according to you lot? I really just don't understand it. And it's not like this is unprecedented - the only other countries I've ever been to that don't routinely use exit checks are the US and Canada. I'm pretty sure every other country I've ever visited in my life, from Europe to the Middle East to Asia, has had exit checks. It's common sense. If you can't check migrants when they leave, how do they know when and if they've left in the first place?",null,0,null,1428528812,null,0,false,0,cq5tet0,null,t3_31ufbv,null,t1_cq5tet0,null,t1_cq59biv,null,null,null,1432276404,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

If we allow the niqab, and make no mistake I'm suggesting we SHOULD. Then you accept that not every head covering is obstructive.

Once you accept that, you have to accept the logical conclusion that since it isn't holy provenance that makes the headgear non-obstructive, that secular headwear may also be equally non-obstructive.

The rules should therefore be constructed objectively.

Headgear and hats must not obstruct X, or cast shadows over Y. 
Z must remain visible at all times.

We already have rules this finely tuned for passport application photographs, particularly as they pertain to eye placement for spectacle wearers. 

And you know what happens? People of their own accord tend to take their glasses off because its a fuck on getting it lined up right without glare, and noone wants to send 2 dozen different sets of photos. But they technically have the right to wear their glasses. 

The fact is hats should be handled the same way, assess by reference to established standards, if ID is impeded reject on those grounds. If not, allow.

But we'd rather just infringe on peoples rights rather than actually construct effective rules. 

Well, if you can call those without a victimhood status ""People"" mirite comrade?",null,0,null,1428529171,null,0,false,0,cq5tn7r,null,t3_31v0ke,null,t1_cq5tn7r,null,t1_cq5amq6,null,null,null,1432276514,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Vorm at the very least is a backup keeper with similar attributes to Lloris, and whom entirely fits with our style of play. Bullshit is that a problem.

While money has clearly been wasted, this is probably more likely down to a simple overall change in recruitment and management style. Baldini was the guy brought in to purchase players for AVB. now we have Poch, and Paul Mitchell was someone he worked with who probably has an eye for the kind of talent Poch wants.

Also, fuck offloading Soldado. I don't care if the motherfucker never puts the ball in the back of the net again. He works like a bitch when playing, never complains, and despite being a near catastrophe as a striker he has never once looked like quitting or throwing in the towel, and has endeared himself to the support as a result.

He was different, but he was still the Doctor and you could tell. He had a playful side which was what he wanted people to see, but you could see there was more behind that. They wrote Tennant's Doctor very well.

With both Smith and Capaldi it just feels like they're slapped in there as new people who're called the Doctor. It took a while for Smith's Doctor to grow on me because all that was written for was the playful exterior and any moments of true seriousness were few and far between. It wasn't until season 7 that I actually started to like him because they started giving him more depth, so he finally felt like the Doctor and not a stand-in with the same name.

So far Capaldi's Doctor comes across as a dick and depending on the episode his personality is all over the place, especially when it involves Clara.

It is great and very very convenient. You just hoist up the back section and push the bike in then let it back down. Easy and better than a cover.

There is a completely metal frame that the cover covers. Pretty solid. 

Bad points are that the cover starts to fray and rip over the front corners. Also rust and mould are an issue in the wet around the bottom. 

Really bad point. During a storm it not only buckled some of the supporting side struts, but dragged my bike over on its side inside the cover. To be fair it was a heavy storm, but the Damn thing acts like a sail. This was in my back sheltered yard too.

Is it not unreasonable for you to ask something that is essentially a waste of time, you know, I know, the Green party core know, that they are never implementing most of these policies. 

People are voting on beliefs, they believe in what the greens are saying, maybe those beliefs are actually financially unsound in some cases, maybe they aren't even technically possible in others, but that isn't the reason you vote for them, you vote for them because you want more scientific funding, you want a more liberal drug policy, you want more environmental policies, you want to stop the cuts to public services, you want to say no to the current parties, that while are slightly different, are all right wing authoritarian parties, especially the majority ones. That is why you vote, because some don't cost money, even the ones I do, now that sounds like madness right? But it isn't, financial investment in science leads to 10x return on your money, while creating international centres of excellence in your country and creating high skilled jobs for your population, you then start importing the talent. There is no money in making clothes or low skilled jobs, the money is in science, design and engineering as well as financial services, making your country a centre for this stuff is the future because other countries are coming to take your crown and when they have their own universities, their own science hubs, their own engineers, if yours are now only average rather than exceptional you no longer get their money. 

IMO the Greens have a good outlook for the future of Britain, is it perfect, not at all, do they seem nuts enough to stick to their left wing ideals and tell the right wing to fuck off, your damn right they do, that is why I am voting for them, not because I 100% agree, not because I am as left wing as them, but because it seems like a reasonable idea for the UK, not the rich, not the poor, the country.",null,0,null,1428529981,null,0,false,0,cq5u5oy,null,t3_31vdi7,null,t1_cq5u5oy,null,t1_cq5t227,null,null,null,1432276756,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

In fact, you're being presented with a well-sourced set of studies and responding that it could be something completely different, but unsurprisingly failing to provide a single shred of evidence to support your alternative hypothesis.

I'd only pick out a couple of points:

Firstly, your claim that atheism is based on ""Antipathy towards the harm religion can do"" is actually a formal logical fallacy called the illicit negative in which a categorical syllogism draws a positive conclusion from one or more negative premises. Your claim that ""frustration towards and resent of harms done to oneself in the name of religion"" is valid is also fallacious since believing all religion to be false because of something done to you by a few believers simply doesn't follow.

Secondly, I used to be a medical illustrator and I can absolutely assure you that the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is definitely not ""junk"". It innervates your larynx and without it you might be unable to swallow or speak. It's different to the right because your body is not symmetrical (most of your organs including your heart are strongly assymetrical) and doesn't develop symmetrically. You have many ""duplicate"" structures - you have two lungs for one thing and most of your vascular system is full of such ""duplicates"". The most important reasons for this are that it gives your body redundancy in case of injury, it enables your body to function well when you're not standing or moving normally and, crucially, it provides a safeguard against developmental problems which malform one structure.

I don't dispute that. The line you've drawn between self-driving cars and increased capacity is interesting and perhaps you're right: they'll be *able* to drive bumper-to-bumper at high speed, and that will free up space on the (existing) roads, increasing capacity. I hadn't considered that.

I suspect (but cannot prove) that the status quo is *so* inefficient that we could, say, decrease physical capacity on certain roads by half (dual carriageways, for example) and *still* see efficiency increases from computerised driving. That calculation can undoubtedly be done.

The key then would be seizing the moment and, instead of allowing the increased capacity to be filled, remove it and replace it with better options (wide cycle lanes; parks; trees; benches; public space, etc.) Admittedly, that's an optimistic expectation of any politician or town planner. But I think I'm right about car parks. Town-centre car parks, and even street-side parking, would become an anachronism. That's two car-wide cycle lanes - better than anything the country has at the moment - on many, many roads, for free.

&gt; The trouble is, if pedestrians don't have a green man, then SCOOT can run so well, that opportunities to cross can become more difficult to come by.

This admittedly awful scenario is still better than the current very-often-lethal setup. It's not an argument against self-driving cars. And this isn't a binary choice. Over time, people would definitely feel safer around computer-driven cars than around human-driven ones.

I also think the paradigm shift from the driver constantly having to pay attention to the road, and to other drivers, will allow infrastructure changes. If you have no control over it, you won't mind if your journey is at 15 mph instead of 20. We don't live in a pure market-led dystopia; society/cities could still decide to narrow roads, limit them to 15 mph, and increase the number of pedestrian crossings. If the driver is no longer emotionally invested - indeed, if they're no longer even paying attention to the road - and their journey is the same time, why would they care?",null,0,null,1428530446,null,0,false,0,cq5ug9f,null,t3_31r5dl,null,t1_cq5ug9f,null,t1_cq5lh7t,null,null,null,1432276894,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

**But what about medical research**? Surely they must be for curing devastating diseases that's not anti-environmental is it?

""Until 2010, the UK's Green Party had rather unambiguous views on the issue too: [they wanted an EU wide ban on embryonic stem cell research](http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/jun/01/european-elections-science-stem-cells-gm). Parts of a statement from Caroline Lucas were reminiscent of the religious right:

*Personally, I remain concerned about the associated health risks, the commodification of eggs and embryos, and the potential exploitation of women. Increasing research suggests that there are a number of promising alternatives, for example adult stem cell research, and umbilical cord stem cell research.*

""Exactly what did Lucas think the associated health risks are in attempting to cure debilitating diseases? To me, this is not merely anti-scientific, it is morally repugnant."" 

Okay what about less science stuff like **new homes?**

Even Paul Cornell (previous writer) called it ""possibly the best doctor who story ever"".

Not to mention Moffat is quite huge in Asia and South America and Doctor Who is an international phenomenon at this point and it won't likely stop anytime soon.

Now, I do realize I'm probably in the complete minority here for loving the Moff but I'm fine with that. I'm just trying to understand what is it specifically about his writing that bothers people. I'm usually able to answer all of his so called ""plot holes"" and his character writing doesn't really bother me. And I absolutely love his ability to string up complex stories and manipulating time.

Started following LFC after watching the Liverpool vs Norwich game in December of 2013.  Suarez captured my attention that night, as I was new to the game, and had not seen a player of that ability.  The energy of Anfield and the club's crest is what held on to me.  The saying You'll Never Walk Alone means a great deal to me on a personal level.  I began watching more and more games, purchased merchandise, etc. I just couldn't get enough of Liverpool, I found myself reading about the history of the club, and just drowning myself in all things LFC.

I then found a local bar/pub in Charlotte, and met many fellow Liverpool supporters, many of whom have become my best friends.  I wouldn't trade one minute of the roller coaster of emotion that I've experienced, during my somewhat brief time supporting Liverpool, for anything.

August of last year was a dream come true for me, who would've thought after recently becoming a supporter, that Liverpool would practically come to my backyard.  The game against Milan in Charlotte, was an experience I'll never forget.  I have yet to be able to make the trip to Anfield, but it's planned for sometime next season.

There are other significant arguments to be made in favour of this change, chiefly that in 30 years time under the Labour system, the government is going to get less of a surprise debt when everyone's loans are written off but that doesn't seem to be the narrative Labour are pushing.

Yeah, you're right.

It's a moderate size city, smaller than Leeds or Birmingham but it is pretty much the capital of the North East and has plenty going on.

Newcastle and the North East in general suffered badly through the 70s and 80s from the loss of traditional industries (coal, steel, shipbuilding) but there's still a decent amount of manufacturing, mostly at the higher skill end of the spectrum.

The accent can be challenging, but most people get by.  There are 2 major universities so they locals are not unused to dealing with pesky outsiders ;)

I'd also throw out my current home, Sheffield.  This was a major centre for steel making. A lot of the big factories have now gone but again there's still plenty of specialist work so you might find something.  Again it's a smaller city but it has plenty going on, and it has the added advantage of being within about an hour or so of Leeds, Nottingham and Manchester so you have plenty of options for a change of scene (Newcastle by contrast is a bit isolated, to the extent that anywhere within England can really be described as isolated - by Canadian standards we're pretty tightly packed!).",null,0,null,1428532857,null,0,1428557990,0,cq5vwft,null,t3_31xazu,null,t1_cq5vwft,null,t1_cq5ulls,null,null,null,1432277577,null,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4,null

By living with tenants you are opening yourself up to ALL of their drama, problems, etc. unless you can handle a strict ""I am the landlord - not a buddy"" policy. It will be especially hard if you are ever in the position of having to evict someone. Living with someone with whom you've evicted, even for the minimum 30 days required (or whatever the legal policy is in your area) can be utter hell. 

And before this goes any further I want to be very clear that I have rented to both friends and people interviewed in person, multiple times, before being offered a lease. EVERYONE has issues eventually. Be it messiness, passive aggressiveness, mental instability - everyone has a problem at some point that you are going to have to deal with. I have had friendships destroyed by living with the person. I have had to deal with people self harming, stealing, lying, sneaking into my bedroom at night, making threats, and physical and emotional abuse. Just last week I had to talk a tenant out of suicide and into therapy. This is not something you can go into thinking you're going to have perfect people move in - you have to be prepared to deal with the most disgusting of individuals. 

It is possible to have a group of good tenants, it's just a rare thing in my personal experience. 

You'll need to check the landlord protection laws in your area, and what the laws are on leasing out rooms. Make your lease as air-tight as you possibly can. Include a clause about possible eviction for creating an unhealthy environment, as well as one negating your liability for stolen or damaged property. Include a statement about guest frequency, pets, and anything that might affect you with those in mind (guests cannot park in driveway, for example).  

I average $1250USD a month when I have a tenant in each room. Their rent includes utilities and wifi. The rent is low because, for the area I'm in (not fantastic, but fairly decent), no one would be interested or able to pay more. If you can, find someone in the area who owns a similar home and ask them what their utilities are - they can be surprisingly high for a full house of people. 

If you want someone to pay your mortgage then I highly recommend purchasing a duplex, or a similar arrangement where you are not livings with the person(s).

We will simplify a lot here:

Say £1200pa is the norm for a yearly wage stipend. (Instead of 26k p.a.)  ∴ £100 is monthly avg, and payback begins at reaching £80.8 per month

Assume income tax is 30% per annum for the first £1200. National insurance is 12%.

Person A (Further Education level) 

Person B (Higher Education level)

Both are on a salary of £100 per month.

Person A has an actual take home wage of £58 

Person B has an actual take home wage of £55.4

Initially that doesn't seem like too much of a difference, but plot this over a lifespan, and Person B will find it much harder to secure loans due to the level of personal debt, more difficult to accrue a deposit for a house, is statistically more likely to encourage children to attend university (and thus be expected to support them in addition to themselves), and an aging population to support - we have a big problem in the making. These are the people who need disposable income to be spent in the economy. When it's going to pay off debt interest, and not back into the circle of cashflow, there's going to be trouble.

Given avg lifetime graduate salary is 29k (£1344pa), and £112 per month, we see an inescapable debt that disproportionately affects those who have sought out prior education as means of bettering themselves, as opposed to simply experiencing life, and begs the question of whether it is now worth it financially to go to university given the mountain of debt facing one upon graduation.",null,0,null,1428533782,null,0,false,0,cq5wgcb,null,t3_31s9be,null,t1_cq5wgcb,null,t1_cq5vtzn,null,null,null,1432277838,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

""The coalition government and our strategic international partners do not support substantial change to the UN drug control conventions. The Conventions provide a robust framework for tackling the harms caused by drugs. We continue to work with our partners to promote a balance and evidence-based international approach to drugs within the UN conventions""

I guess this is the same 'evidence' based approach that moved cannabis back to class b from c, and the rejection of the ACMD to reclassify MDMA.

There is evidence to suggest legitimate potential use for MDMA in the treatment of PTSD and some forms of autism. Evidence for LSD in the treatment of end of life anxiety, alcohol addiction and treatment resistant depression. There is also emerging evidence for the use of Psilocybin in the treatment of OCD. I believe the propaganda surrounding these substances must stop, legitimate research be made far more accessible through reclassification. I consider the fact we have lost 40+ years of potential research as a direct result of government policy to be one of the most significant societal disservices of the century.

Securing loans has no relevance. Student loans do not show up on credit files and do not come into the equation when granting personal loans. They do come into account when applying for mortgages under the new rules where they look at your actual incomes and outgoings... but guess what? it's actually favourable for the new system as they have MORE money available per month and that's what the banks look at! They do not care about about the balance, absolutely nobody does and nobody should.

Also your definition of an unfair tackle doesn't take into consideration that the defender wasn't trying to win the ball as such, but more so trying to stop Allen from scoring. Which is then a professional foul is it not? Doesn't look like he's competing for the ball to me.

It does obscure features. The question is, how much and weighing that against forcing people to choose between their religion and driving.

&gt; If we allow the niqab, and make no mistake I'm suggesting we SHOULD. Then you accept that not every head covering is obstructive.

Only if the decision to allow is because it is unobstructive. My point is, it  **is** obstructive. But that is weighed against other things as well. (And as an aside - did you mean hijab because there is no way a niqab should be allowed if google images is to be believed on the differences)

We say no headwear because it is easier than saying ""You can have a ribbon up to 4cm, but not a motorbike helmet. You can have a baseball cap, but only if the sun visor is behind you. And absolutely no cowboy hats unless you have a texan accent""

Even your way of doing it is too create a list of rules rather than a simple one line phrase which any idiot can understand.

And then they have to decide on religous exceptions, because it is still simpler to tell a small percentage of the population ""oh and also this"" than it is to tell the entire population complicated rules.

As ForeverFlawed said, you will definitely need a bus pass if you're living in Fallowfield because the engineering campus is in the North Campus. I know some people who cycle but trust me when its mid winter, you definitely would not want to cycle to uni every morning. In addition the bus pass makes it convenient to get to the city centre and around Manchester in general so definitely get one. Also if you're living in Fallowfield and have 9am lectures, be prepared to get up slightly earlier so you can catch the earlier buses because the buses from Fallowfield are ALWAYS full in the morning and the journey can take up to 40 minutes each way if its during peak times. Nevertheless, Fallowfield is definitely a great place to live. Great social life + plenty of eateries around. But after a year or so you may find it more convenient to live a little closer to Campus once workload starts to build up. Either way, well done on your research so far. You definitely seem to have read up about Manchester and have a good approach towards uni. Feel free to ask any other specific questions.   

Edit: Thinking about it a little more. If you're free you can definitely self learn CAD SolidWorks and MatLab. You will be learning these 2 programs in your first semester and Matlab is very coursework intensive and having some understanding on it would be really beneficial.

He could show that the economy began to recover and recover well under Gordon Brown, and that when austerity policies came into effect they demolished that recovery. 

He could wheel out a legion of mainstream economists who would support these statements and further agree that austerity harmed our recovery relative to other nations. 

But he won't. Because the man is a coward and because he doesn't understand normal people.

The experts are typically professors in/close to the subject but it never feels dry or academic - these people love their subject and  Melvyn keeps everything interesting and rolling along.

If you like football then I highly recommend The Football Ramble and/or the Guardian's Football Weekly Podcast. The former is more comedic and my preferred option while the latter is more serious.

One of my favourite podcasts is Rex Factor, which light-heartedly reviews British monarchs with a top-trumps style points system. They've gone through all the Kings and Queens of England and are now starting on 'series 2' on those of Scotland.

If you want something with a shorter run then I recommend Serial, which follows a reporter investigating the true story a possibly innocent man in the US who was imprisoned for murder over a decade ago.

* Harder to wipe out four subs spread separately across the UK and other territories.
* Usage for spare parts, and can be quickly activated should the two subs collide with large pieces of [metal ice](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/31i6l3/royal_navy_nuclear_submarine_suffers_500000/) or [pending invesitigation](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/defence/10697895/Navy-warship-accidentally-fires-torpedo-at-nuclear-dockyard.html) or [crashed on training](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-11605365)
* Running any ship often requires multiple crews per submarine, and so you need to have at least two crews per ship trained and ready for duty at any time. Because you need at least one ship in action at any time, you need a real submarine to train on. Probably two if you wish to keep a sufficient number of servicemen trained and ready.
* Can be activated at a cheaper cost  (time+money) than building from scratch. Should we need the ability to have four subs to cover our patrol area, the two training subs can undergo preparations for combat. 
* Economics: The cost of building only one of these subs is astronomical. It is best to do the construction in one go as there is a large set up cost for the construction of these devices. It's best to pay a large sum up front and build duplicates (which you will need 80% of the time) rather than spend the same amount of money 4 times over later.
* Just a large capability in general. It means that we are not restricted when is comes to a defence matter of this importance. One lone sub can be tracked (Docking and supplies) and targeted (with sufficient resources). Two subs will cause issue for any enemy we have and allow a one in/one out system. Three subs allow for one sub to be active, one for repairs, and one for training. Four subs allow us to be prepared for any situation, specifically all out war should it come to it. The latter is precisely the reason you want multiples of these subs defending our interests.

You make it sound like the only way to decrease social exclusion from higher education is to allow universities to charge more with the caveat that they must be more inclusive. This cannot be the case. The government has the power to increase social exclusion without resorting to fee changes.

The fees have never been £6000 or £9000 a term. They are per academic year.

Your fourth paragraph contains only two sentences. It's rather hard to follow.

You mention the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Gap of what? Number enrolled? Academic achievement?

You say 'far fewer people went to university, and those who did tended to be very rich'. Where are you getting this information from? Historically lots of factors influenced the rise in higher education not least the rise of the polytechnic. The world of work has changed. We have far less factory jobs. May this not have been a factor?

Other than that I kind of feel the topic is flawed. Labour opposed the higher fees to start with as did the lib dems. The labour party is at its heart a socialist democratic party. Whatever way you paint it, higher fees impact the poorer disproportionately despite the thin tory veil of 'increasing access to university education'. The fact remains that the average graduate will soon have almost £40,000 of debt. You say you're a labour supporter. You talk like a tory, pal.
