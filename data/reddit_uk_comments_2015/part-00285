Modern principles, instinctive cultural touchstones for us, have no direct analogy in the philosophical and societal consensuses of the past; the further you go back, the more this becomes true. The past is a foreign country; your philosophical outlook and superior hindsight don't fit in there. 

Plus your characterisations *are* undoubtedly simplistic - the East India Company did the bulk of the early conquering as a private corporation given leave by the Crown to set up a monopoly.  Do descendants of the Indians who joined the sepoys not get reparations for ancestral treason? Do we open up the can of worms over whether Indian nationalism even existed during the conquest and most of the 19th, or whether actually the political entity is a creation of British Imperialism?

Without getting into slavery, I'd be interested to know if you thought the Mughal Emperors, who were Muslim and from central Asia, were of greater or worse influence on the subcontinent, and should Takijistan thus pay reparations also? The Maratha Confederacy, from the south-west of the continent, also expanded and enslaved their fellow Indians contemporaneously with the British before being defeated, should that state of India now pay a dividend to their fellow countrymen for their past misbehaviour?  Did some Indians not also get wealthy due to Empire? Or were they all treacherous running dogs of the evil Victorians?

I am humouring you, but if we are to apply reparations as a remedy, we have to construct a method for measuring damages. 

Anyway this is all semantics, Narendra Godi is a populist prime minister from a party who spent 10 years in unexpected opposition. As a Hindu nationalist and a potentially divisive figure in a politically and religiously heterogenous subcontinent, he needs legitimacy urgently, and appealing to the conceits of uneducated popular nationalist Indian opinion reinforces his position as a moderniser of a corrupted and compromised politcal elite.

Having done a fair bit of research already I've realised it's complex and potentially a grey area.

We use a firm of lawyers in cases like this but the person I deal with is away until Monday. I was really just trying to gauge [professional] opinion.

I am very familiar with trademarks and trademark law from previous cases I've dealt with related to my company. The main thing here however, is that our website launched before any trademark was even applied for. It seems ridiculous that someone can apply for a trademark then demand you hand your business over, even though it was trading before they'd even thought about filing a TM application.

Usually we apply for trademarks for physical products we manufacture or license. Because this is the name of an actual website and because the name is in use by so many other businesses, we didn't TM it. Add to that the fact it's a generic industry term.

Really though - my impression is from reading too many stories like this one, reading books written by ex-muslims, watching documentaries and following the news.  Oh, and I also regularly read /r/islam, although I don't comment there.  

And my feeling is that there really is a problem.  That many muslim organizations will pretend to be one thing when the spotlight is on them, but will say something quite different in private.  That we *can't* afford to take British Islam entirely at its word, when it claims to be tolerant and for secular values.

Well, I don't want to overstate my case.  I'm sure that most muslims are quite moderate on most issues and I'm certainly not claiming that every muslim is an extremist, because that just isn't true.  But I do think that we need to practice some skepticism and not allow Islam to go unchecked.  

Edit:  [Here's an interesting piece](http://nicemangos.blogspot.ca/2015/07/an-ex-muslim-perspective-on-camerons.html?zx=c0976adacfa36742) I was reading just now from a female ex muslim discussing Cameron's Islam speech.

They typically invest with a 3-5 year view on exit, but depending on the type of fund and the performance of the company it's not uncommon for this to drift to 7+yrs.

To understand how incentivised you should feel about them, I would look at roughly what % of the company fully diluted your options equate to. Don't worry if it's a tiny %, if you're in an established profitable growing company in a hot area then it may be a tiny % of a very large pie. 

Next you need to understand whether you are in the money or not, and how much the options will be worth. Some companies are very open about current and planned financial performance, others incredibly secretive, but your FD should be able to give you a sense of the goals - and there's no incentive value to the options unless you can understand what they might be worth in a range of realistic exit scenarios.

I would also pull down the articles from Companies House (or again, if you have an open FD just chat to him/her) to understand if the VC has any liquidation preferences (they get money before all the other shareholders), preference shares (which might be accumulating the equivalent of interest) or shareholder loans (effectively ditto). This is just something to factor in to views on the value of the company as your value comes out behind these arrangements. You should also get familiar with the good leaver/bad leaver clauses, so you know what (if anything) you lose if you leave before exit. Typically anyone who doesn't retire or die is a bad leaver... but treatment of leavers can vary hugely.

I would suggest that you always, politely, seek more options in future pay reviews as there's normally a pool of options unallocated and if you don't ask you may not get. They can be very valuable if your company performs well.

null,false,horsefish5,null,null,null,"I've been being treated for anxiety for a few years on the NHS, so this advice is based on my experience of it - first step is to spend a few days writing a list of all the forms the anxiety takes, what situations it happens in, how frequently it happens, how long it has been happening for and the physical symptoms.

Then make an appointment with a GP - I just went to a random one and got lucky that he was really nice, but you might do better going to the practice/calling and asking for an appointment with a GP with experience with mental health.

Then just go to the appointment and pour your heart out - start with blurting out 'I think I have anxiety problems' and then go through the list you wrote; I promise they will take it very seriously and believe what you're saying. They tend to define anxiety as being at a clinical level when it is affecting your ability to carry out normal daily activities, so maybe try to emphasise how that's happening for you.

The GP will probably then tell you that the main treatments for anxiety are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and medication; don't feel like you have to go straight to medication if you don't want to, I only decided to go down that route a year later and the doctor was always very supportive of my decision. If you choose to do CBT the doctor will call a local NHS counselling service and refer you (or possibly give you a number to call and refer yourself), and they will give you a telephone interview where you tell them everything on the list you wrote at the beginning, so they can decide which therapist and type/intensity of CBT would be best for you. In my case I had to wait 4 weeks until I could start my CBT course, which was 6 sessions of 1 hour every two weeks. At the end they decide if they need to offer you another course or not, or a different kind of therapy.

My CBT for anxiety mostly focussed on something called 'exposure and habituation' - you can probably just google that and it will come up with the course they use, you could even try to go through it on your own but having the therapist's help is really good for motivation and making sure you're doing it right, so I'd definitely recommend trying it with a therapist first. You basically have to list all of the situations you're afraid of and the coping mechanisms you usually use - for instance, one of mine is always chewing gum (my main fear is being sick in public, and this helps). You then rank the situations you're scared of in order of how scary they are, and starting with the least scary thing on the list you put yourself in that situation without using any of your usual coping mechanisms and focus on how you're feeling in terms of your anxiety. The idea is to feel your fear and realise that it won't hurt you, the situation won't hurt you and that eventually the anxiety lessens the longer you're in that situation. I think you're supposed to stay until you think your anxiety has lessened to about 40% of what it was when you started. As the less scary situations get easier you progress to the harder ones until you can eventually do it all! I found that a really helpful technique to try, although I also have depression and most of my CBT sessions ended up focussing on that because it was pretty severe, but it's been a year since I finished that therapy course and I've just referred myself back to do another one, so hopefully I can focus more on the anxiety this time.

Sorry that was such a wall of text! I hope that's put your mind at ease a little bit. It took me ages to work up the courage to go to a doctor, it takes a lot of bravery to say all of these things out loud, but they are there to help and it's a surprisingly common thing to deal with, so they will know how hard it is for you and how to make it easier.

I realize you're committed to this theory because it sounds right on a very basic level, but it's far from accepted. And even if it were somehow more of a ""gateway drug"" than other substances (somehow based on properties that no study has been able to find) I'd recon that requiring contact with drug dealers to aquire it would have the biggest impact on future drug use.

Lung damage: Acute bronchitis that abates with cessation. No evidence for increased risk of cancer or chronic pulmonary disease in moderate use, not enough data on heavy use but there's no evidence to suggest it is even on the same plane as your made up statistic. FWIW, here where it's legal many people are eating or vaping anyways. Here's one reputable study... Not sure where you're getting your facts aside from your own ass. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23802821

Addiction: Psychological dependence is possible, but it's possibly the very least addicting of commonly used intoxicants. While it can certainly happen, it's comparatively rare enough to be a non-issue when compared to legal booze and tobacco. 

Memory: Utter bullshit, after 48 hours there is zero evidence of any changes in memory function. Where are you getting this shit? 

There are plenty of harms from cannabis, it's a mind-altering drug for fuck's sake, you don't need to make things up. No one is saying otherwise. What they are saying (sometimes too zealously) is that compared to commonly used legal intoxicants, it's undeniably safer to a massive extent.

Our traditional ground, prior to Clegg, was the left. Not the distant left, definitely not trade unionist authoritarian left, but social liberalism. Kennedy's leadership, and Ashdown's before him - were clear examples of this. It's the ideology that (despite the claims of Labour) created our welfare state and NHS.

But regrettably some people take it to extremes and use it as an expression of some inner perversion.  The average Muslim is no more likely to be violent because of their religion than a gamer because they played Call of Duty.  The very idea is silly.

To me Islam is just a club with [beautiful art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_art), an amazing [holiday club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj), and [strange fashion sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_clothing).

There's another article here explaining what Vodafone want to do with a spun-off Openreach -

&gt;In Italy, Vodafone has teamed up with rival mobile operator Wind to offer to buy a stake in the partly state-owned fibre-optic company Metroweb. The Italian government is planning to invest €6bn (£4.2bn) to build high-speed networks across the country. 
&gt;
&gt;Vodafone is advocating using Metroweb as a vehicle for a shared national fibre infrastructure, and Colao said the same could happen in the UK. Such a project would avoid wasted resources, he argued, by deterring fibre companies from digging up the roads twice to build competing networks in the same neighbourhoods. “It’s better to share, and compete at the service level, rather than all build in the same areas.”

Such a project would avoid wasted resources, he argued, by deterring fibre companies from digging up the roads twice to build competing networks in the same neighbourhoods. “It’s better to share, and compete at the service level, rather than all build in the same areas.”

This is what PIA was meant to achieve back in 2010 but OFCOM have given OpenReach, and BT, way too much leeway over pricing for duct access amongst other issues. Good on Vodafone for calling both organisations out on their bullshit.

null,false,mediaboy,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt; I think the most shocking thing about this is that the Sylvia Young school, a school which is totally focused on preparing children for the entertainment industry, evidently doesn't cover the fact that 'talent' shows are not actually genuine.

This gets rather convoluted, so I'll include my **tl;dr: people that aren't working in the industry lack the perspective that makes them listen to people that are working in the industry**. You can read the bold parts below for a quick summary of my thoughts on this.

To give some background about me and where I'm coming from here: **I work with a lot of (sometimes even genuinely talented) youths.** I don't work a school like Sylvia Young, but I'm pretty invested in youth performing arts. 

 **Students and other amateurs become convinced that they are far better than they are because they operate in a vacuum, a small pond in which they are the biggest fish**. Often, amateurs see you telling them not to do talent shows as a failing on your part: you couldn't win the talent show, but they're obviously better than you and they're obviously going to win this talent show because they're better than everyone else. **This means that they ignore whatever you tell them and plough on regardless**. You have to realise that there's a difference between a working professional saying ""these talent shows are not genuine, and it will end your career if you go into them because they're just that bad"" and their student going ""these talent shows are not genuine, and all the adverts I hear telling me that I can be the next biggest thing if I just win this show should be ignored"".

Ironically, **parents, guardians and well-meaning idiots don't help the situation: I've had several students tell me that their favourite teacher at their school has entered them because they're just so talented**. Forget that I could provide them with a list of local competitions adjudicated by people that I trust to offer valid and detailed feedback, forget that I could offer to put them in touch with other groups and companies that have far more rigorous entry guidelines and much higher standards, forget that I could provide them with application forms for some of the best youth theatre groups in the world: **X-factor and shows of this ilk on the TV have an abnormally high profile and people that don't know better think they offer an opportunity to develop performance skills**. They don't, because development is tied to feedback (you improve because someone tells you how to) and the feedback offered on shows like this is limited to basically only those that the producers care about, and even then probably isn't as in depth as some other competitions.

**People see shows of this ilk as a gateway to the big fame, and it isn't. If anything, it's going to ruin their career**. But, as I said earlier, they become obsessed by this high-profile stuff and eventually you just have to wince and then ignore it. I no longer bother to argue with anyone that tells me they're going to make it by winning a show like this. I tell them that they won't win it because it's true, and then I try to (once again) recommend half a dozen ways of improving or expanding that would be of much better value to them. **Most people give up when they hear that turning professional involves more than 5 minutes of work filling in forms but some people decide I just don't know what I'm talking about at all**. And then you see them make a fool out of themselves on international television and mentally cross off the idea of recommending them to that agent that emailed you asking if you had any promising talent as they were looking to take on some more people. **At the end of the day, it comes down to a question of ""Do teenagers listen to qualified, experienced professionals or their best friends?"" and the vast majority of teenagers would much rather listen to their friends**

**The sad thing is that even if they win it, they probably won't get work post-xfactor rush.** Its just, well... why would they? **There are three things that get you work in performing arts: reliability, personality and talent. X-factor winners don't have reliability because they've only won one competition, have their personality ruined by the ego-inflating x-factor win and (usually) don't understand that talent is the first step to performing, not the last step**.

Add that onto issues with audience expectations (""they won the xfactor, they must be really really good!"" -&gt; ""wait, these guys are shit compared to xyz. Where's [all of these ancillary things that xfactor doesn't do]?"") and performer expectations (""I won the xfactor, everyone will respect me now"" -&gt; ""why do all of these professionals burst into laughter when I leave the room?"", ""superstars act like this right?"" -&gt; BREAKING NEWS: $TVSHOW WINNER ARRESTED) and dealing with generally younger people (""What abo- whoa, squirrel!"")? They're just high maintenance people, and most agents run them into the ground pretty quickly (or quit as their agent).

This is a (fairly well known?) issue in the industry amongst those that care. The vast majority of professional performers that I know just don't care. We watch TV shows of this kind for the train wrecks that we can see coming and laugh about them behind closed doors.

and entertain

&gt; (1) The BBC’s main activities should be the promotion of its Public Purposes through the
provision of output which consists of information, education and entertainment, supplied
by means of—

&gt;(a) television, radio and online services;

&gt;(b) similar or related services which make output generally available and which may be
in forms or by means of technologies which either have not previously been used by
the BBC or which have yet to be developed.

&gt;(2) The BBC may also carry out other activities which directly or indirectly promote the
Public Purposes, but such activities should be peripheral, subordinate or ancillary to its
main activities. Overall, such peripheral, subordinate or ancillary activities of the BBC
should bear a proper sense of proportion to the BBC’s main activities, and each of them
should be appropriate to be carried on by the BBC alongside its main activities.

It is a national institution with a stated purpose, and as such the idea that everyone should contribute. The fact that it should be funded in a consistent, non-political way, seems reasonable to me.

&gt;What exactly would not allowing Islam to go unchecked consist of exactly?

Primarily, I think we should hold Muslims to the same standards as everyone else!  We also need to be honest about problems when we see them and stop treading on eggshells in case we cause offense.    Finally I think we need to vigorously defend freedom of speech, especially when it comes to the taboos surrounding criticizing Islam and Mohammed.

&gt;I'm talking about the futility of trying to retrofit modern principles onto the past

That's a red herring. I'm asking whether we should feel pride in our Empire, *now*, as modern people (and many of us evidently do), reflecting on the story of our civilisation. 

Secondly, I'm asking for the sober analysis of whether we are in the position of relative luxury we find ourselves in today, as a direct result of our subjugation and exploitation, within living memory, of a country who's citizens today face the most extreme poverty imaginable. It's not about accepting moral guilt for the actions of our ancestors, even those who are still alive, it's about acknowledging that the economy of the world is the shape it is for historical reasons.

&gt;Why anyone would join Isis is beyond my comprehension, so having the ability as a parent to stop my child ever coming to harm would be welcome.

Why is this beyond her comprehension? Wouldn't it be good for her to investigate this before writing in a national newspaper on this exact topic?

&gt;But just out of curiosity, if my child’s passport is confiscated, would they then be labelled a “non-violent extremist” and, if so, what would be the consequences for them?

Well yes, attempting to run off to join a fascist, Sunni-supremacist takfiri death army should get you labelled as an extremist. Volunteers for the Waffen SS would face consequences too.

&gt;There is a lot of talk at the moment of “ideology”. To be clear, “ideology” doesn’t make me feel isolated. “Ideology” doesn’t drive radicalisation. 

How can be people be radicalised into adhering to a violent, racist ideology and that ideology not play a role in that process?

&gt;Islamophobia, foreign policy and double standards make me feel isolated and scared and, I suspect, are the real driving force behind radicalisation.

What does this even mean? How is ""Islamophobia"" driving former regime elements of the Iraqi Ba'ath Party to wage genocide against Iraqi Yazidi and Christians? If she means racism, why are white Britons going off to fight for Daesh, and why are other British minorities who experience racism not engaging in this kind of violence?

What does foreign policy have to do with 15 year old London schoolgirls? What the heck does ""double standards"" refer to?

&gt;Muslims and Islam have been vilified and demonised by society and the media. Islamophobic attacks are on the rise. And no, I haven’t been the target of an Islamophobic attack yet, but I’m also not naive enough to think it won’t happen to me just because I don’t wear a headscarf or because my clothing is more westernised. I dread opening my news app in case there’s another unfair, biased headline for which I will then have to apologise, whether it’s about child grooming or a violent killing.

These are concerning, but why are these bigger problems than jihadist violence in the Middle East and here in the West? Is it not possible there are solutions to both jihadist violence and racism which both originate in a committed defence of liberal democracy and pluralism?

&gt;The media’s prejudiced use of the term “terrorism” has created the link between the word Muslim and terrorism, embedding it in people’s minds and propagating hate towards the Muslim community.

We continue to face a terrorist campaign from violent Republicanism in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain today, and have done since the 1970s.

&gt; Anders Behring Breivik was labelled a terrorist until he was found not to be Muslim; then many chose to brand him a “mass murderer” instead.

""Many"". I don't know anyone who wouldn't call Breivik a terrorist.

&gt; Dylann Roof was described by many people simply as a “shooter”, despite having a manifesto of hate.

""Many"", again. He was also a terrorist - why not argue that both Roof and Breivik as well as jihadists are terrorists?

&gt;Why should I have to stop my children from watching the news or reading the papers?

???

&gt;The media is using the actions of a few – who quite clearly do not understand the meaning of Islam – to tarnish 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide and demonise a peaceful religion.

Which is why the PM made his distinction between Islam, Islamism, and Jihadism.

&gt;You completely failed to mention foreign policy.

No he didn't, he said that it was a mistake to blame to jihadism on foreign policy, as this writer is doing. Jihadism predates Western involvement in the Middle East and is best understood as a domestic movement which targets the West - it rose to prominence with the Iranian Revolution, but has its roots in the use of Islamic irregulars by Pakistan in 1950s Afghanistan and Kashmir.

&gt;how do I explain to my children that 519 Palestinian children were killed last year and the UK did nothing,

What does this have to do with anything? These were children killed because of Hamas' ongoing jihadist war to destroy the State of Israel, ftr.

&gt;approximately half a million people were killed in Iraq 

As have half a million in Syria, where we deliberately chose not to intervene because of arguments like this, and we have experienced the rise of the most powerful and violent jihadist army the world has yet seen. (This comment of hers also ignores the culpability jihadists themselves had in causing that violence and its Iraqi roots in Saddam's regime).

&gt;Can you come and explain that to my two boys?

Yes, this is quite straightforward actually.

&gt;I wonder what the future holds for them. Will they be able to practise their faith or will they have to do it discreetly for fear of a teacher reporting them under the current Prevent legislation? Will any signs of increased religious practise be seen as a sign of “radicalisation” under this legislation? 

They will be allowed to enjoy their religious freedom, so long as they don't engage in violent behaviour or language. Ideally they should understand that they are able to practice these freedoms because they live in a liberal society.

&gt;What will the job opportunities be like for my children?

Good, provided they have skills rather than retreating into spooky pseudo-political mysticism for education. Given she's a GP, I expect her children will have a fantastic education and opportunities.

&gt;You expressed disgust at those who believed “Muslims were taking over the government” when all they would like to do is engage with the system – and surely this fits in with “British values”. But how will you ensure this happens fairly? You failed to mention how you will tackle the discrimination currently faced by Muslims in the workplace. Where is the policy intervention to address this issue so Muslims feel like they “belong”?

PM makes general point I have to agree with ==&gt; Criticize PM for not being specific 

&gt;So when will you be replacing the Quilliam foundation with people who represent me and have some credibility and respect among British Muslims?

Eh? What's wrong with Quilliam? If the fact that a liberal Muslim organisation is viewed with such disdain by Muslims in Britain, isn't that indicative of a problem?

&gt;There are “moderate” practising Muslims and organisations who are willing to work with you to tackle the threat of radicalisation and who are representative of the 2.7 million British Muslims living in the UK.

Is the Muslim Council of Britain really that moderate when they just can't stop themselves from making anti-Semitic statements and engaging in apologetics for Islamists?

&gt;The thoughts and worries are endless. This is the reality of being a Muslim in Britain at the moment.

There is no one reality of being a Muslim in Britain today, and this self-pitying, conservative, nauseating tosh is definitely not that reality. There are gay Muslims, liberal Muslims, atheist Muslims, feminist Muslims, indifferent Muslims, Islamist Muslims, jihadist Muslims - and most of all Muslims who are happy to live in this country as citizens and who understand that the Government is not persecuting them as this muppet believes.",null,0,null,1437862815,null,0,1437863398,0,ctg38ju,null,t3_3ej10r,null,t1_ctg38ju,null,t3_3ej10r,null,null,null,1440084249,null,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3,null

Arsenal are light in midfield and upfront. If they don't manage to strengthen then they'll be third or fourth. Sanchez will be amazing.

We will struggle defensively again, we are light in defensive midfield and need to sign another solid def mid player to give us a realistic chance of CL qualification. We have too many players in the attacking positions and not enough quality defenders. If we do qualify, then it will be a coaching masterstroke with our center backs and midfield suddenly undertaking a near godlike birds eye view understanding of defensive positioning. I want Henderson to stay up late studying Alonso videos and play regista. Will Shorty be gaffer next season? It's a tough one. Benteke over Suarez? could he be the chosen one?

I see City struggling for form with Silva and Aguero unfortunately falling to injury and with it their title bid. Sterling will probably be the last one fighting.

Because I honestly cannot tell the difference. I need someone to explain it to me. If you consider making negative comments in another forum ""trolling"" then what the hell are 85% of the people here still doing online? AM I only allowed to remain in my teams sub? AM I restricted to only posting positive remarks on every thread? Free speech much? Reddit, the bastion of freedom, right? All I did was go into a team's sub and have discussion, some negative - ok mostly negative, so what! - posting remarks in good fun. I made fun of their team's decision to acquire a player. I posted examples of how bad I thought that decision was. And I received pushback from those members, and got downvoted. THAT'S the way it's supposed to work here! I got downvoted for my negative comments, that's my choice. It's not your place to ban me from expressing my opinion? Or is it? Is there a limit on how many opinions I can post there? If so, what is the magic number? I need specifics because leaving it so gray is not fair. Tell me my boundaries and I will stay within them. Or is it just ""whatever you feel like?"" Specifics please.

&gt;Are you serious? This is the response from the moderator? I ask for detailed explanation of why I got a bullshit ban, and this is the response I get? Ok, let me ask around the forums, the other mods, and the sub followers and see how appropriate they all feel this is. This is not moderating - this is dictating like a jackass.
And when you get off your lazy ass for a minute, I'm still waiting for the explanation and examples of the posts I made that warranted a ban.

&gt;Mod team - one of you, severedfragile, replied to my request for examples and a detailed explanation of why I was banned with a simple ""Dude, stop being a fucking child."" What the hell is that about? Does this represent the general consensus of all the moderators? Is this how you all normally talk to sub members and replay to their inquiries? I'm certainly anxious to find out how the bulk of you feel about it, as well as the rest of the subscribers. Since I have several accounts and my wife has a few as well, we'll be informing others about this crap and getting their general opinions about it. I, and I imagine others, expect the moderators to MODERATE, not issue unwarranted bans for simply expressing my opinions in other subs, and certainly NOT belittle and insult subscribers who questions their precious moderator power. Ridiculous. Mods, this is unacceptable. Severedfragile, you're a poor representative of this sub and should be removed.

Parliament can reject legislation, but it almost never does, and that's no coincidence. It's part of the design of the system. And it's practice, not capability, which decides what becomes law.

It's true that in a rare case of a slim majority a party has to be more careful, but it shouldn't be overstated. The vast majority of the legislative agenda will still go through with zero effective opposition. It's just one or two bills over the course of the five years that are contentious issues.

But the 50th Anniversary book line is a good example of different Doctors as they appear on television. Most of the classic Doctor books are reprints from either the MA or PDA lines (or is a novelisation in 7's case. Earthworld comes from the EDA line IIRC).

*Ten Little Aliens*, *Dreams of an Empire*, *The Last of the Gaderene*, *Festival of Death*, *Fear of the Dark*, *Players*, *Remembrance of the Daleks*, *Earthworld*, *Only Human*, *Beautiful Chaos*, and the *Silent Stars Go By*.

To that I would add *Engines of War* (The War Doctor novel) and any of the 12th Doctor novels. I haven't had the chance to read them yet (by which I mean I haven't got enough money) so adding anyone of them will do to complete the ensemble.

Alcohol: Of course it's relevant. We're talking about the legality of commonly used drugs, unless intellectual consistency is completely irrelevant. Also, was someone arguing for legalization without heavy controls? I have literally never heard someone advocate that. Is that what you think we're talking about? Weed vending machines on street corners?

I'm on mobile but will look at your link later. You'll forgive me if I look at your country's reports with scepticism as well, this guy sound familiar? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nutt Unfortunately there is a terrible lack of information because of the hyperexaggerated illegal status of cannabis so we have to take what we can get. 

Memory: I mean that there is no solid evidence at this point for long term effects after the initial experience, which does mess up encoding and recall as we all know. Also, why are we looking to a lung focused organization to teach us neuroscience? 

Again, alcohol is both way more addictive and way more harmful than cannabis. You can die from too much alcohol! Once you're addicted you can die from too little! Apples and oranges. If I created a drug policy it would be based on something similar to this:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Development_of_a_rational_scale_to_assess_the_harm_of_drugs_of_potential_misuse_%28physical_harm_and_dependence%2C_NA_free_means%29.svg/800px-Development_of_a_rational_scale_to_assess_the_harm_of_drugs_of_potential_misuse_%28physical_harm_and_dependence%2C_NA_free_means%29.svg.png

I don't study sociology, why do you ask? Which part do you argue with? That the facts that were propagated were known horse shit and still inform the debate today? That the drug policy from the last century was admittedly and clearly based on racial motivations?  

Legalize* (I'm a yank) and you misunderstood that part, I meant that ""drugs are bad, ban them"" was the ""common sense"" nonsense approach. Once you delve into the knock on effects on both an individual and global scale, you see (or I do anyways) that in practice the ethical scales start to tip quite quickly in the other direction. If you truly care about individuals, let them come out of their dark hovels and stop slinking around like criminals. Let them live and seek help without fear of life-ruining consequences. Let the light in on the subject so we can have an honest, transparent, and informed discussion as a society. If you truly care about the world, let's take this huge source of funding from the barbaric despots who control much of the Americas. I have lived in Mexico and the entire country is led by shadowy armies whose main source of funding is the drugs that people in developed countries pay grossly inflated prices for due to prohibition. You better bet that's where much of your drugs originate as well. Its simple fact. Since prohibition is clearly an utter failure by any possible metric, continuing it is not only damaging to the social fabric of our countries, but to the wellbeing and stability of the countries that these drugs come from and travel through.

If I could snap my fingers and everyone in the world would stop taking drugs I would, but it's painfully clear that no amount of force aside from complete fascism and constant surveillance will curtail their use. These are just two angles among many to look at the problem, and in practice they all point the same direction. 

So I ask, who is it that you're feeling this ethical obligation to exactly? Am I missing something? I wish we had an NHS and I too think that no one should profit from another's illness. Unfortunately with the status quo there are people profiting from people's addiction, and they are the absolute worse sort of people imaginable, be they the cartels or the government employees at every level that are paid off. This is the reality, ignoring it because in theory prohibition should work is at best naive, and at worst malicious.

&gt; DMI was contracted out to the technology services provider Siemens with consulting by Deloitte... A core part of the system was formed by using Cinegy, a production suite originally developed prior to the DMI project by the BBC and selected by Siemens in 2008.

Chelsea will run away with the league again as their squad is stronger than everyone else.

Arsenal will build on their recent success and just pip Man City to 2nd.

Man City will fail even worse this season into 3rd but still safely Champions League (Pellegrini sacked end of season)

Liverpool haven't got the pressure of title contenders this season but have improved their squad quite well. 4th will go down to the wire. (Plus with Rodgers basically announcing two different teams for Europa it allows him to concentrate on the coming weeks league game with the others, something United don't have the option of with Champions League)

Man United have improved their squad but I just don't see them delivering this season. If Liverpool didn't shit the bed from the Arsenal game, Man United wouldn't have been top 4 this season in my opinion.

Spurs feels like the most obvious option in this, lucked there way into 5th last season (with said LFC shitting the bed) and I just can't see their improvements building the team into a top 4 contender.",null,0,null,1437864876,null,0,false,0,ctg4ae5,null,t3_3eljac,null,t1_ctg4ae5,null,t3_3eljac,null,null,null,1440084744,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

I think that Islam is already a major issue of concern to UK intellectuals and we're going to start to see serious academic firepower been committed to finding ways of analyzing the risks and seeing what we can do about them.

I also have some hope that Islam, at least as it is practiced in the UK, will be compelled to reform.  It is going to take a lot of outside pressure, but I think, eventually even Islam will buckle.  Bad ideas cannot stand up indefinitely to an influx of good ideas and I don't see why Islam should be an exception.

Honestly - I think that Cameron had mostly the right strategy in his speech on Islam this week.  He admitted there was a serious problem with this particular religion -- quite a brave step for a Western leader, when you consider that other leaders are still parroting the 'nothing to do with Islam' rhetoric.  He promised to get tougher on those who cross the line into Islamist extremism - but he also emphasized that the government will support and provide incentives for true moderates who will stand up against extremist ideologies.

Hey /u/paracetamox ! Welcome to a really fun and annoyingly addictive game :)

As /u/mikefromthemeetup says, it's generally the most beginner-friendly venue, although Excelsior has a number of very beginner-friendly players as well. Area 51 isn't necessarily unfriendly, but week-to-week it runs quite high-level drafts.

If you do decide to pop along to an event at any store, either introduce yourself as new to the person running the event or try and find one of your local friendly judges. There's Matt Crocker (that's me!!!), Guy Baldwin, Nathan Hughes, Kieran Tippet and Lee Kin Yen who regularly turn up to events.

Finally, some info on the main stores:

It's very comfortable but it's likely you'll need to adjust the default suspension preload as a lot of people complain it's too sprung. I'm 6ft6 and have no issues riding this bike long distances at all. There's quite a bit of vibration at low-mid RPMs and some fairing buzz too. You get used to it after a bit (I don't even notice it anymore) that's just how they are. The stock mirrors are a bit shit for visibility, they also blur up in the vibey rev range. The bike has a nice amount of torque and you can lift the front when pulling away if you're not paying attention, which is always good fun! When stationary you may notice a quiet but very high pitch whine, that's the fuel pump, perfectly normal but that confused me when I first got mine.

You can know about it in theory, but try watching BBC Parliament some night in real-time when a vote is expected and watch them all get up and go to vote. 

Watch how some move to vote, while the others just hang around aimlessly chatting to each other because they know the queue will be too long right now.

And the caption on the screen says when the result is expected in the future. 

Then watch that time come and go 

And then wait some more

And then wait some more

and then an eternity later they have the result.

Then watch as they repeat the process if they have another vote.

Combine that with the BBC doc on the House of Commons from a few months ago showing you MPs who aren't in the chamber hearing the vote being called and running all over the place, throwing their kids at their staff as they leg it down to vote.

I myself manifested severe anxiety and chronic depression after 18 months of daily use in my late teens. The emotional problems were obviously always there but I am sure that the daily use of marijuana exacerbated them.

Also the other difficulty is that people with mental health problems find temporary relief through drug use, as I did. When I first started I became the person that I always wanted to be, even when not stoned, my anxieties seemed to almost disappear, but they began to return and the longer I smoked the worse they became until I couldn't function without weed.

I've been clean of all drugs for 14 years, except for about 18 months of diazepam abuse/alcohol problems about 9 years ago. I still can't smoke weed or do drugs as it makes me panic, which has probably been good for me.

I can now enjoy a drink without the need for it to relieve anxiety and I can function well, I feel that I am on my way to happiness! (Thanks to lots of good counselling and life experience).

What are your thoughts about what I've said here? I would really like to hear what a professional thinks about my point of view.

Nor is mighty fucking red. The club should be appealing to children by giving cheap tickets to schoolkids and reopening the boys pen, not by getting a ridiculous red bird that makes some kid 5,000 miles away pester their parents for Liverpool merchandise.

I'd love to see LFC and Everton team up to offer free tickets to kids who do well in school or do great community work. But that'd never happen, would it?

Chelsea's senior players are actually concerned about ticket prices and have debated taking a slight wage cut to subsidise ticket prices. They already subsidise away travel. If Chelsea are doing more for their fans than LFC, then what does that say?

Any club that sees its fans as a product to be sold to advertisers rather than a group whose interests should be placed above those of corporate ticket holders and the all-reaching commercial arm isn't unique, and isn't a club anymore.

&gt;“In constitutional terms, secrecy is anathema to the rule of law because legal and political accountability is impossible without transparency,” he said. “If errors are made, they must be brought to light — but there is little incentive for the prosecution, intelligence agencies or government departments to acquiesce when they can invoke national security to ensure secrecy.”

&gt;Critics contend that such secrecy risks eroding not only civil liberties, but ultimately the effectiveness of the intelligence agencies, too.

&gt;“The more secret the organization is, the more inefficient it tends to be,” Mr. Davis said. “It’s unwise to think of them as a bunch of hyperefficient James Bonds. They probably aren’t.”

&gt;“The truth is,” he added, “that there is no such thing as secret justice. If it’s secret, it’s not justice.”

&gt;The appeal against the reporting restrictions has now been adjourned until the autumn, but in one public session this month, Lord Chief Justice John Thomas acknowledged that there were “really difficult constitutional issues” at stake.

&gt;A few minutes later, those reporters without special permission to attend were politely asked to leave.

I suppose we'll see what happens in the autumn.

null,false,mediaboy,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt;Go on then, how much did your parents pay for your education?

I went to a private school that costs several tens of thousands a year. I went on a full bursary, and was offered other scholarships and such alongside this to subsidise extra costs. 

I was far from the only one there on a scholarship or bursary. If anything, I would say the vast majority of people I interacted with regularly had a scholarship of some kind that was based on them participating in some extracurriculars of some kind. I imagine it was the ones I didnt interact with (as they didn't do so many of the extracurriculars) who were paying full whack. 

There were very very few people there that were ultra rich (though I have stories about those that were, as do all private school students). Most parents were very middle class, a few maybe pushing towards upper middle. Teachers were common. Doctors and lawyers also. A few bankers and business managers. Professional workers, but not the kind of people that earn a million every year. 

Private school is relatively affordable if your child is capable of attaining scholarships or your finances would support a bursary. Presuming that you're a professional worker and have relatively few debts that is. Orher trends would be that nearly everyone there had a cohesive family unit, most had very few siblings close in age and small extended families, parents had stable long-term careers. If you're not buried in debt and you're relatively successful, private school is manageable I feel. 

The question is whether the downsides of private school insularity - protecting kids from the real world for a few more years - is worth the private school education, (which is so much better it isn't even funny. State schools lack funding, staffing and impetus to provide anything like the same service.

Chelsea are Chelsea. Well structured and boring. They'll win games 1-0 mostly and hold out for draws when needed. Occasionally they'll go on a goal spree against the lesser sides and when Hazard is in the mood.


Personally I feel like Cech was a huge signing for Arsenal. Even though they don't have a ""world class"" striker their mids chip in with enough goals. Arsenal always create chances. I think they'll be a little more settled defensively this year and will come 2nd in the league and win a cup. 

United have a decent side but I think there'll be a gap between 1st and 2nd and the rest. I don't think they're good enough defensively. De Gea is the only reason they got 4th last season. Few new signing which will create some more chances. Mata will be really good this coming season I feel like.

City. What can I say. Talented players but there's just something off. No team spirit. Nobody playing for each other. They need a few new signings to give them a serious push. As of now, they'll struggle against the top teams, especially if Aguero gets injured.

Liverpool. I have NO idea what to expect. I'd like to think we gel well and try and get some kind of momentum going. Honestly if we start to play well again and can just grind out results and not throw games away I'll be happy. 

Honestly have no idea who'll finish below 5th..",null,0,null,1437881417,null,0,false,0,ctgcdlb,null,t3_3eljac,null,t1_ctgcdlb,null,t3_3eljac,null,null,null,1440088621,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

I'm talking of the fluidity of tactics here, it's all about the formation you have Peps' Barcelona and Bayern its a perfect example, they interchange so much in a game. Overloading one side of the pitch, overloading the defence, almost a default formation, but, always maintains a back 3 with the midfielder sitting in deep, or a maintaining a back 5 but exertion pressure with mid to high defensive block.

I agree the problems are huge and the solutions hard.  But the area has suffered because too many in the past just said ""nah, nothing we can do, let it go"".

Take a look at Broomhill - things like wrecked housing stock etc. didn't happen overnight...it happened because the area was written off - now a scottish government is giving funding to help, and it's getting some refurbishment.  Not enough, but some.

We do need jobs though.  Number one thing Inverclyde needs is stable, GOOD jobs.  Not more call-centres or Amazons, although those jobs are welcome, we need GOOD jobs, jobs that pay well, like you find in Glasogw, but here instead...

We have a lot of positives despite the problems.  We have acres of brownfield sites, cheap land, a motorway running right through us, we're next to one of the worlds most navigable river esturaries, we've got a container shipping port AND a cruise-liner terminal, more trainlines than most areas, and we're 10 miles from a major international airport, and 20 from a large city which has serious problems finding space for new investment.

We have the space, the infrastructure and the people.  All we've lacked before now are government's willing to help.  Now we have that - and look what's happening.  It's slow - progress always is, but we've new housing,  - decent, affordable housing...and Jim McColl is planning on single handedly bringing back serious shipbuilding...I'm sitting about 300m from a site that in just a couple years could well be building world-class military or commercial shipping...we may even be able to get the QE2 back, and make her Scotland's biggest visitor attraction.

There is more detail on that study in [this summary] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168246/) but basically the team tried CeraVe, Cetaphil and Dove moisturisers. If you want to try this please discuss with a pharmacist or the prescribing doctor.

There seem to be two Simple Light Moisturisers - hydrating and protecting - don't go for the one with SPF because the filters might clash with your chosen sunscreen. I will be interested to hear what you think of the Green People product, we don't yet have a consensus here on SCA UK on good 'local' sunscreens.

Consider also using a moisturiser at night, this can support skin barrier function (keeps water in, bacteria and irritants out). CeraVe PM lotion from Amazon has 4%  niacinamide which is proven effective in acne vulgaris, otherwise you can use the same moisturiser as for daytime.

The UK has taken over oversees territories before, suspended their institutions, and have run them directly from London. Last time it happened was in 2009 when Turks and Caicos islands were put ""under administration"". In this case it was to do with widespread corruption. But it shows it can be done.

http://www.economist.com/node/14258950

&gt; THE self-rule that the Turks and Caicos islands have enjoyed for 33 years was taken away on August 14th, when Britain removed their elected premier, cabinet and assembly, and suspended most of their constitution. For the next two years or so the islands, whose population is around 38,000, will be run by their governor—the representative of Queen Elizabeth.

&gt; Britain felt it had few choices, following the publication last month of a report by an inquiry, headed by Sir Robin Auld, a former British judge, which found a “high probability of systemic corruption” in the tiny country's government, with ministers apparently bribed by foreign property developers. Sir Robin described the situation as a “national emergency”. He recommended a police investigation of Michael Misick, who resigned as premier in March but denies wrongdoing, and other government figures. The report noted Mr Misick's reputation for enjoying a “Hollywood lifestyle” and said his spending habits “far exceeded his salary and allowances”.

&gt; Thirty years ago the islanders scratched a living from infertile soil, salt pans and fishing. White sands and clear waters have since spurred a tourist boom, with an added fillip from offshore finance. A steady flow of rich white expats and impoverished Haitians has swollen the population.
In this section

&gt; Dizzy economic growth has not, alas, brought political maturity. Voting rights are limited to adult “belongers”—broadly, the locally born—of whom fewer than 7,000 are registered. The assembly's 15 seats have electorates as small as 190. Politicians have built tight support networks with favours given and received. Mr Misick's now ex-wife, LisaRaye McCoy-Misick, told the inquiry he had handed out $100 bills to voters before winning a landslide majority in the February 2007 election. Privileged belongers have been sold crown land for as little as 25% of its market value, sometimes flipping it onwards to commercial developers. For those who lost favour, though, life could be difficult. A British parliamentary committee visited the islands in 2008 and found a “palpable climate of fear”.

&gt; Mr Misick has called on islanders to “resist” British rule. Galmo Williams, who briefly succeeded him as premier, said the islands had been “invaded and recolonised” with a “dictatorship” like “the old Red China”. The suspended opposition leader, Floyd Seymour, has “mixed feelings”. But some locals are angry that Britain did not step in sooner. In July the Caribbean Community said meekly that a new election would be better than direct rule. The islands have been through all this before. The constitution was suspended in 1986 after an inquiry into arson and alleged corruption. Sir Robin's report noted how little had changed since then.

&gt; There has long been a debate on whether the Turks and Caicos and other micro-states in the region are viable as self-governing entities. For most of the imperial period the islands were run from Jamaica or the Bahamas. As Britain's Caribbean colonies were heading towards independence in the 1950s, there was a short-lived attempt to unite them all in a West Indies Federation, to be run from Trinidad (which has recently talked to some neighbours about a possible union). There have also been various suggestions down the years to unite the Turks and Caicos with distant Canada. Returning them to the mercies of chaotic Jamaica would offer few benefits. But the Bahamas, having made great strides in overcoming its own corruption and drugs problems of the 1980s, would seem a good candidate to take the islands back under its wing one day.

Everything on the keyboard is fully working with LED's etc, however I bought it after it had coke spilt on it and spent about a week cleaning it every day to restore it to its former glory. Every single key now clicks very smoothly except some of the lesser-used keys with stabilizers which I haven't spent much time trying to clean, and are still clunky. Many of the switches have a very small ping, although it's hardly noticeable. Just curious as to how this would affect the value of the keyboard.

They'll be back. They're going through an identity crisis at the moment but once they get a leader in place who isn't Ed Miliband they'll return to their natural modern position; generic centre-right politics.

Scotland will leave the UK in about 5-10 years and people will seek an alternative to Conservatism eventually.

Broken, needs fixing, but won't happen with the Tories in charge. When Scotland leaves, reform of the system will rear its head again.

&gt; PS: If Britain does leave the EU in 2017, Britons won't be able to leave the country and make a good living in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Finland, etc. like they can now. They'll be trapped.

Norwegians aren't trapped. Nor are the Swiss. Britain wouldn't leave the EU and not be a part of the EEA. Whether or not the UK leaves the EU, you're almost certainly not going to be hindered in leaving home.

But the irony of leaving the EU to join the EEA is that the anti-EU crowd claim we don't really have any say in what happens in Europe. Well, if we wanted to trade with EU countries we'd have to sign up to about 75% of EU legislation (Norway has to do this) but without having ANY say on the legislation itself. Madness.

Dresden was in East Germany, although similar principals apply, just from the opposite end of the political spectrum.

&gt; Kind of annoys me when the Germans think they used their hyper intelligence and amazing engineering prowess to rebuild their country, and become one of the most developed countries in the world.
&gt;
&gt; In reality they were just pumped full of cash after the war.

It's a bit of both really.  As a strategy for a long-term peace, it was a work of genius: during the war, destroy as much infrastructure as possible in a Sun Tzu ""destroy your enemy completely"" way[1]; this is followed by a 40-year rebuild and reconstruction.  At the end of the period there's so much momentum behind peaceful economic growth, and the population is two-generations from the war generation, and you have a stable prosperous friendly country where there was a mortal enemy not long before.

It's also a myth to suggest Germany was the main beneficiary of postwar aid.  Britain received more cash from the Marshall Plan than West Germany did: http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/marshall_01.shtml

This is where German ""intelligence"" and ""engineering prowess"" comes in, they spent it in the right areas.

I'll bow to the knowledge of others regarding cheek puffing. An assumption I've made from watching others play.

I'm not sure how quietly you can play a Sousaphone, but if the audio on the clip is genuinely the guy playing, then that's certainly loud enough to illicit a more obvious reaction than the non-existent one on the clip.

The 'instrument in his hands' clip was more of a double entendre than anything else :)

However, I'm sticking to my initial opinion because if you listen again, there's no sound of anything else on that clip - rain, car engine, talking, wind...

I'm happy to concede that the guy may well have been actually playing, but the audio on that clip definitely wasn't him. Perhaps the actual audio was such poor quality because of the conditions that they decided to over-dub it. That would make a bit more sense to me.

null,false,ishouldthrowaway,null,null,null,"I don't know about London in general as I've never been there longer than a weekend, and even that was too long for me, but I can talk about a few things I didn't realise about shared ownership until I bought one. 

The value of the share can go up without the actual house value going up. You might want to consider this before buying. For example, the house new may be worth £100k when its built, and the HAs will sell 25% for 25k. However, 5 years down the line the house could now be worth £110k, and the 25% share is actually worth 40k. Now wether this extra value above the 25% is mortgageable I'm not sure, and this could tie you up depending on how far along in the ownership line you are. If you're buying the flat new, this could limit your potential pool of buyers when you come to sell. That said, if it is mortgageable then it's definitely a very good thing as you will be gaining actual value, instead of only 25% or 50%. Its nice to know that things such as putting in a new bathroom may actually be worth it in the long term. I also find (my whole street of houses is shared ownership) that the 25%s always go up quicker than the 50% or the 75%. For example, houses are now worth £110k, the 25%s are worth about £40k ish and the 50%s are worth about £60k ish. Something to think about when deciding what % level to buy and also when you feel like you may want to staircase up the values, wether the cheaper rent is actually worth the potential loses. However, you do generally buy the extra 25%s at 25% of the market value and the HA will consider what value you have personally added to the property in that time. 

One other thing which may be obvious is that the rents can and do go up, so obviously factor this in as interest rates will rise too. 

I don't know how useful any of that was but let me know if you have any more questions and i'll do my best to help. I personally really like the scheme as I'd never have been able to secure a mortgage on this house without it, and i live in a really nice place. In future i'll hopefully sell and although i won't be able to make a step up as such (i.e, I'll probably just be able to buy something very similar but with outright ownership) it was definitely the right thing to do at the time.

We had a work outing to Blackpool Zoo because my then workplace sponsored an animal. The plan was that in the morning we would go and 'stroke the goat', get the obligatory photos for the local rag, then have the afternoon free to enjoy the delights of Blackpool.

I got a bad vibe straight away: endless crappy little run-down  guesthouses - the kind of place a niaive tourist might book into and find themselves sharing a bathroom with a DSS heroin junkie and a 'masseuse' + punters.

The real shocker came when we went to get a drink and aimed for the bar at the foot of the tower. This was just after lunchtime on a midweek day, broad daylight obviously. As we approached there were blokes pissing openly in the street. Bouncers at the front door kicking the shit out of some lairy chavs who looked about 16. Despite being early afternoon, inside it was full-on clubbing like 2am on a Saturday night at some crappy small town 'disco'. Deafening club music, black as night, humid sweaty air. Everyone absolutely shitfaced - I mean like twelve pints up batfaced by 1 in the afternoon. Not even a sticky floor - floor actually wet, flooded with spilt lager, vomit, condensation. Broken glass everywhere. Rival hen parties attacking each other. Steroid fuelled knuckleheads wondering around shirtless trying to start fights.

By about 2pm I decided that Blackpool was one of the worst shitholes I've ever set foot in. It's like Magaluf minus decent weather, for people who can't afford a budget airline ticket. The place reeks of deprivation, it's run down, it's economically desperate, nobody invests in it or maintains it, it's merely propped up by booze fuelled visitors who lack other options. Blackpool's glory days are far behind it. You can see the evidence that once, in the 60s and 70s, Blackpool was like a British Vegas. It's like an archeological dig looking at the relics of a great empire, but in reality your just shoveling dirt and picking through bones. Blackpool is dead but still moving - zombified.

Taking tablets is not a magical 'cure' - they might make your mood better if you feel low, or stop you sweating and heart racing if you are anxious, but they won't make the problem go away.

You read the article? The point being made was that its the schools *monitoring* the political views that children already have in their heads and being legally bound to report them for extremism:

*""""I explained to him my views about freedom and justice and that I supported Palestine. I said I thought Israel should have tough sanctions put upon it and he said these could be radical beliefs,""""*

Personally I think school is *exactly* the place where we should be helping children to understand politics and the complexities of many of these situations because understanding and knowledge is what will *prevent* radicalisation. 

Instead we're saying *""Don't think about it, don't talk about it or you'll be in trouble""* and so kids don't talk about their views in school, become isolated and marginalized in their worldview, are limited in the diversity of opinions that they are exposed to ... and **that's** how you radicalise someone.

Back when the deal was done to reduce the number of hereditary peers sitting in the House it was always meant to be the first step in a proper reformation of the place.

The deal was that each incoming government would add peers to the Lords so it broadly reflected the vote at the previous General Election.

This, with peers appointed for life, means that the size of the chamber would continue to grow. It was meant to be this pressure that brought about ""stage two"" and a reformation of the Lords to a more democratic system.

If we are just going to have a system to reduce their numbers then that pressure will disappear and we will never get that change.

As to the general point - aye, Britain's not going to be fucked by a government or two of either political stripe; it survived pure Tory governments in 1979, 1983, 1987, and 1992, and it survived pure Labour ones in 1997, 2001, and 2005.

Worth noting that while the Tories had a nationwide vote of 36.8% this time, in 2005 Labour had a nationwide vote of 35.2%.  And got a bigger majority.

null,false,satanspanties,,President of the Official Stellar Tortoise FC Fan Club,null,"I finished up *Not that it Matters* by A. A. Milne - I loved this sweet little collection of essays on everyday life.

I also read:

*A Clockwork Orange* by Anthony Burgess - A short book, but one it could be easy to get bogged down in on account of the language. I know Nadsat dictionaries exist, but it's far better, I think, to go with it and pick it up as the story progresses; it heightens the immersion. Mine was the British version with 21 chapters, IMO a much more satisfying ending to the story.

*Sophie's World* by Jostein Gaarder - One a friend lent me as a blind recommendation. One of those books I think is better that way, when you watch the story unfold at the same time the characters do.

*Bartleby, the Scrivener* - An odd tale. I'm still not sure what I think about this one. I liked it, it was good, but I can't make my mind up on my interpretation.

*Jane Eyre* by Charlotte Brontë - I loved it, but I don't find Rochester a particularly attractive hero. Unlike Darcy from *Pride and Prejudice*, for example, he does little, if anything, to redeem himself. Interesting that the first person narration from the woman who supposedly loves him draws a less sympathetic character than Austen's third person though.

*Wide Sargasso Sea* by Jean Rhys - I read it all in one sitting and it's a wonderfully claustrophobic book. Possibly responsible for my above evaluation of Rochester. A fantastic piece of writing.

*The Martian Way and Other Stories* by Isaac Asimov, compromising 'The Martian Way', 'Youth', 'The Deep' and 'Sucker Bait' - As always, Asimov's prose is functional at best, and frequently clunky. Also as always, his ideas more than make up for it.

*The Blind Assassin* by Margaret Atwood - A gorgeous piece of writing. Perfectly structured and beautifully written, I can see why this is the one that won her the Booker Prize.

*Station Eleven* by Emily St John Mandel - Unfortunate in that it was the book that had to follow *The Blind Assassin*, but it put up a good fight. Normally post-apocalyptic fiction isn't really my thing, but I enjoyed this; it appealed to that part of me that feels culture is something worth holding onto and wasn't as bleak or desolate as some other recent works in the genre. The different elements came together well and the conclusion was open but satisfying.

Currently reading:

*Gulliver's Travels* by Jonathan Swift - I think it makes its point. It's also decent adventure fiction. There's not much for me to say about this that hasn't been said.

Up next:

*The Left Hand of Darkness*, maybe? *The Uninvited*? *And Then There Were None*? *Great Expectations*? I really don't know.",null,0,null,1437903974,null,0,false,0,ctgjovl,null,t3_3en95z,null,t1_ctgjovl,null,t3_3en95z,null,null,null,1440092133,null,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2,null

so that does not justify the crimes committed by you.

No , But you have heart to whine and dictate what Indians should do or what our priorities should . Why guilt ? you enjoy it .

Thats because you are on the other side of the equation. Its very easy to talk high, I too can quote lot of things.

Because your BBC propaganda is too much to handle ? and what on the earth would others have to deal with us ? 

Are you stuck in 18 th century ? we are dealing with ourselves. May be instead of focusing on us you should concentrate on your own problems. I heard rapes and child rapes are so high even police do not have prison cells to hold them ?

Well, she *wasn't* so not sure what point you're trying to make here.

&gt; However Mary was still a child and therefore Jehovah was a paedophile.

She wasn't, and you've clearly misunderstood the concept of immaculate conception. There's a reason she's known as the *Virgin* Mary.

&gt; You cannot simply claim to be the epitome of morality and be less moral than us no?

Who has done this? Not me. And you're the one who appears to be claiming moral superiority here.

&gt; You dance through hoops to justify Jehovah's paedophilia as ""normal""

Citing facts about Jewish law is not 'dancing through hoops'. Twisting the narrative to make a weird equivocation is though. Maybe you didn't notice, eh?

&gt; Mohammed ""marrying"" a 9 year old was probably quite common practice.

Probably? Are you guessing?

It wasn't by the way. The marriage was one of political convenience. The girls father was a powerful man who went on to be the next Caliph after Muhammad's death.

Don't postulate vagaries and guesses when there are perfectly good facts available.

&gt; It's a cheap scare mongering tactic 

I agree on this. You'll notice that I haven't perpetuated the 'Muhammad was a paedo' nonsense.

My issue is with the way you've chosen to combat it - this ridiculous equivocation by saying that the Christian god was a paedophile. That's technically the same God as Islam, by the way, so you're not doing muslims any favours there.

Use the facts. Firstly, Muhammad waited to consummate until she was of age for the time. Secondly, the marriage was of politics not of attraction. Thirdly, by all accounts his first wife, Khadija, was the love of his life - she was 15 years older than him. He was not a paedophile, and it's ignorant to claim so.

IANAL but the relevant legislation appears to be the [Environmental Pollution Act 1990 section 79](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/43/section/79), clause 1(g).

Clause 80 then describes a two step process: first, the council has to agree with you and issue an abatement notice. Secondly, if an employee or member of the club breaches the abatement notice, it appears that they have committed a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to £20,000. YMMV because this law has separate (but apparently identical) versions for England &amp; Wales and Scotland and it appears that it doesn't apply at all in Northern Ireland.

I would echo the advice about keeping a diary. Also, if you want to dig deeper, it might be worth finding out your local councillor's attitude to the club. Google his/her name and the club name. If they are a member, you may find it more difficult to get an abatement notice.

This is a year of rebuilding the club after Sam Allardyce's reign, which, whilst seeing the club finish well in the league, produced football so dire that a 2-1 victory against Hull was booed. Optimism echoes around the Boleyn Ground. Despite being fairly unproven at this level, the appointment of Slaven Bilic was greeted positively, given his status as a fan favourite, and an active transfer window seeing genuinely quality being brought in, with particular excitement revolving around Dimitri Payet. There’s a sense of optimism about the club which hasn’t been seen since the 2002/03 season when Joe Cole was captain, which saw us, er, relegated. The fans would see a top 10 as a good season. Our porn baron chairmen just want us to be in in the Premier League when we move into Olympic Stadium next season.

2. Our star of the season is normally affectionately left to Carlton Cole, but given our sweet prince looks to have definitely finally left this time, the club has a fairly promising squad. Aaron Cresswell will hopefully continue to progress after his standout season last year, Diafro Sakho will hopefully stay fit for the entire season and continue his excellent goal scoring record, Andy Carroll will hopefully not have to be put down by the vet. Dimitri Payet however, is our most exciting signing (so far), and has looked excellent in pre-season, and is a definite upgrade on Stewart Downing, who leaves for Middlesbrough.

3. I'll exclude Andy Carroll here, because let's be realistic, he's already injured and that ain't going to change too much throughout the season

Sakho - Valencia

Payet

Noble - Kouyate - Obiang

Cresswell - Reid - Tomkins/Ogbonna - Jenkinson

- Most building are in a state of disrepair, the whole place is a mess. 

- Rats, everywhere. 

- If you go to the shops, don't expect good customer service. Don't even expect to be told how much it costs. They'll just stand in silence until you give them money. 

- In fact, the people of Luton are as close to clinically insane that I've ever seen.  Everyone is angry and misinformed. I think not long ago someone was attacking people with a butchers knife in town.

- The train station car park is nicer than the train station. 

- Bury Park is like a foreign country.
 
- The entire place is just hugely overcrowded. Horrendous car and foot traffic, all the time. 

- Don't smile, you're looking for a fight if you do. 

- Nothing in terms of nightlife really, unless you count a Yates and two other tiny loud bars.

null,false,aenor,null,null,null,"&gt;Isn't the EU more democratic than ever before now? Just last year we had the first elected Prime Minister of the EU, rather than an appointed and rubber stamped one.

He was ""elected"" by the heads of the 28 member states - so a very small electorate, and because so small, susceptable to strong-arming by the big states.

Here's Varoufarkis on how decisions are taken (he's talking about the eurozone, but that group is only slightly smaller than the EU one):

http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2015/07/yanis-varoufakis-full-transcript-our-battle-save-greece

&gt;it’s that there was point blank refusal to engage in economic arguments. Point blank. … You put forward an argument that you’ve really worked on – to make sure it’s logically coherent – and you’re just faced with blank stares. It is as if you haven’t spoken. What you say is independent of what they say. You might as well have sung the Swedish national anthem – you’d have got the same reply. And that’s startling, for somebody who’s used to academic debate. … The other side always engages. Well there was no engagement at all. It was not even annoyance, it was as if one had not spoken.

&gt;HL: What is the greatest problem with the general way the Eurogroup functions?

&gt;YV: [To exemplify…] There was a moment when the President of the Eurogroup decided to move against us and effectively shut us out, and made it known that Greece was essentially on its way out of the Eurozone. … There is a convention that communiqués must be unanimous, and the President can’t just convene a meeting of the Eurozone and exclude a member state. And he said, “Oh I’m sure I can do that.” So I asked for a legal opinion. It created a bit of a kerfuffle. For about 5-10 minutes the meeting stopped, clerks, officials were talking to one another, on their phone, and eventually some official, some legal expert addressed me, and said the following words, that “Well, the Eurogroup does not exist in law, there is no treaty which has convened this group.”

&gt;So what we have is a non-existent group that has the greatest power to determine the lives of Europeans. It’s not answerable to anyone, given it doesn’t exist in law; no minutes are kept; and it’s confidential. So no citizen ever knows what is said within. … These are decisions of almost life and death, and no member has to answer to anybody.

 

&gt;HL: And is that group controlled by German attitudes?

&gt;YV: Oh completely and utterly. Not attitudes – by the finance minister of Germany. It is all like a very well-tuned orchestra and he is the director. Everything happens in tune. There will be times when the orchestra is out of tune, but he convenes and puts it back in line.

 

&gt;HL: Is there no alternative power within the group, can the French counter that power?

&gt;YV: Only the French finance minister has made noises that were different from the German line, and those noises were very subtle. You could sense he had to use very judicious language, to be seen not to oppose. And in the final analysis, when Doc Schäuble responded and effectively determined the official line, the French FM in the end would always fold and accept.

This kind of thing goes on in the bigger meetings too, which is why neither Blair, nor Brown nor Cameron have made any headway at all.

I see Arsenal as a mentally weak team, that always struggles to be consistent and frequently 'bottles it' when it matters most, with that said, they could beat that hurdle and push on.

I rate Walcott highly, and when we have been linked with him in the past I really wanted him but his downfall is unfortunately injuries, I'd really like him to stay fit for a season because he seems like a genuine professional and its hard to see that kind of player suffer through injury. Whereas Giroud, I honestly don't rate him at all, he's nowhere near the top 25 in the world right now and to lead the line in the Premiership and to win the league, he isn't good enough, he isn't of that right calibre if you will. Don't get me wrong, he shows glimpses of class, he has that sexy French ability to finish well, but so many times a season, he disappears, another inconsistent player, who can be marked or bullied out of a game, quite easily infact and to win the league, you need better than that imo and they don't really have backup for that, other than like you say, Walcott who is unfortunately more often than not injured.

And I admit, a physical presence is the wrong term, I should have said an anchorman, someone who does the dirty work for a midfield that likes to get forward, Matic for example, who protects the defence and midfield, when Fabregas, Oscar, Hazard get forward and leave gaps for teams to exploit, more often than not Mourinho will deploy an extra DM alongside Matic against the top sides for that exact reason.

Yes the Muslim bashing in the media is outrageous, and yes there has been a minor rise in ultra-right wing attitudes, but regardless the Muslim community as a whole had full control over their response to the situation, and they've chosen to close the drawbridge, shut themselves off from the rest of society, rather than trying to excise this cancer from the heart of their community. 

What I fear is how much the extremism will spread because of this response. Mosques used to work quite closely with police and security services to deal with people that got a bit 'too radical', but how this is uncommon and needs to be forced on them. All of my Muslim friends (and because of where I live, I have a lot) used to say how much they love the west, would always be criticising how Islamist countries treat their citizens etc, but now regularly launch anti-west diatribes, spout about how the Islamic countries are great and that the world will not be at peace until Islam rules the world. The one thing in common that I've noticed is that in the past the religion was secondary to their lives, now it seems to have infiltrated their brains and is controlling them like a master of puppets. They associate more with being a Muslim, than being British.

To me THIS is the problem. They consider their membership of the 'Muslim brotherhood' as being more important than a citizen of their country, or even more important than being a good citizen. If this continues then there cannot be integration.

I hope the situation hasn't gone too far. I miss meeting my Muslim friends for a beer, a laugh, and a bacon sandwich.

You can't dump your whole savings into it, it's £200 a month (plus optional 1000 at the start) which will earn you £300 just for doing that I believe.

You can cash out (to your lender!) as soon as you have £400 bonus so if you do £1200 on day 1, and save for 2 more months at £200 you'll have that. Can't see anything beating that return, and if it's something you're about to do anyway (buy a house) in the next 6-9 months or more, I don't see why you wouldn't bother.

Someone who takes painkillers everyday for a physical pain is just trying to ignore that pain and feel normal for a while, but the cause of that pain isn't being tackled.

Cigarettes don't actually caused relaxation, they just alleviate the desire for one, and it's this desire/addiction that causes stress. While weed officially has no addictive ingredients you do get addicted to the feeling of relaxation/normality, and you don't know how to get to that state without weed.

The new series of The Clangers is wonderfully true to the original. The recent 3D CGI versions of Fireman Sam, Postman Pat and Thomas The Tank Engine are not only awfully animated but are written and voiced terribly too. True low-budget programming. 

As a father I see more of the BBC's output for children than most, and I have to say that I very much enjoy the subtly wicked sense of humour in Raa Raa and Hey Duggee. Alexander Armstrong is the narrator for Hey Duggee and it is the icing on the cake.

&gt; We have always focused our energy and resources completely on the Main Stand - it's a very big and very expensive project! We need to make sure we do a great job bringing it to a successful completion before even considering any further changes to Anfield. Then, and only then might we take a look at Anfield Road Stand. At the right time, as with the Main Stand process, a robust research process will be undertaken to ensure there is a sustainable solution, one that works financially, before we could consider applying for full planning permission. Like the Main Stand, Anfield Road is rather complicated - there are services that run under the road as well as a number of other social and environmental issues that we will have to consider when the time is right.

I don't really have a high and mighty attitude towards them. I'm pro-legalisation. 

&gt;You're clearly not one of those people by your own admission, so what harm would come from trying drugs?

Clearly not unhappy? Hmm, that's debatable. But I don't believe in short term fixes. 

&gt;Your life is going to suddenly change and you'll no longer be happy and no longer be able to enjoy yourself without cocaine?

Yes, actually. A friend of mine went down to London for Uni. He was a reserved guy, and I suspect he probably found life difficult. He ended up taking cocaine, and now seems to require it to enjoy himself. So much so that he once came back to mine wanting to do it in my bathroom before we went out to the pub (which I refused). That's not healthy in my view, and whilst I'll always be there for the guy no matter what, I think cocaine has been a very unhealthy influence on him. It's not just a bit of fun. 

&gt;It's just a laugh for most normal people. I know loads of people who do coke now and again, and none of them seem particularly unhappy with their lives.

Your mileage may vary. I'm pro-legalising it to cut out the drug dealers and stop the 'aura' around taking it, but I think, like many forms of substance abuse, it's not a bright thing to be doing.

Arsenal (and so did we to be fair) needed Schneiderlin or Kondogbia but those ships have sailed. 

Even without that holding player though, Cech is going to improve Arsenal's defence massively. I'm not sold on Paulista yet, he's got tonnes of potential but looks a little tactically naive. In contrast, Mertesacker has the experience but lacks the pace Arsenal need to play a high line and pussies out sometimes. Koscielny is excellent. So another holding midfielder (an upgrade on Flamini at the very least) would have made a huge difference. Might still happen, plenty of window left.

I probably wouldn't put Giroud in my top 25 either, but something he doesn't get much credit for is the way he links with the attacking midfielders. When you've got players around you like Sanchez, Cazorla &amp; Ramsey who can contribute 10+ goals per season each if they stay fit, that's a potential for a huge amount of goals for the team, not to mention he's averaged 15 goals per season since he debuted professionally.

The disease is a combination of two factors, both of which would be difficult to fix:

Firstly, some schools are terrible, and have an absolutely shocking track record on every known measure.  This becomes self-fulfilling, as good teachers don't want to work at bad schools, etc.

Secondly, upper-middle class parents are more likely to both: a) know how, and b) want to, play the game.  Lower-middle class parents, and below, seem to have a misplaced sense of fairplay, ""I didn't get any favours at school, it would be good for little Johnny to do everything himself too!""  Upper-middle class parents, on the other hand, will pretend to be Roman Catholic, move house, and use Uncle George's connections at &lt;prestigious Oxbridge college&gt; to ensure little Johnny gets a good start in life.

To equalise all that... good luck.

The only strategy I can think of that might work is to try and bring all schools up to such a level, that the advantages of the top schools (for there always will be some) are made relatively smaller so it doesn't make too much of a difference.

Video evidence of a man breaking easily 3 laws that carry a minimum 2 year jail sentence is ""up to some mischief""? What fucking planet do you live on?

&gt;He's an idiot and has resigned, but that's about as far as this needs to go IMO

Oh yeah, that's totally why it's OK to do drugs and fuck kids if you're a rich upper class politician right? Fuck you. Fuck you and your entire pandering, soft ass, slap-on-the-wrists mentality that has let our political leaders enjoy a nice easy slide down into the depths of depravity and publicly funded luxury, where laws LITERALLY do not apply to them and they are free to pass as many controlling and over-reaching laws as they can think of to keep the corporations profiting on their good side. It's exactly your mentality that has fucked our government in the ass so hard over the last 20 years and turned the UK into this shit hole that we're only now seeing emerge.

Fuck that noise. Fuck that and fuck you for supporting that kind of shit.

If politicians aren't to be held accountable to the laws then who exactly are they accountable to? Why is it that they should get a free pass on breaking laws that would see every single other person in the country sitting in a jail cell right now with this amount of evidence. This easily qualifies as reasonable suspicion and drug tests are a thing you know. Prosecution is not only the right thing to do, it's morally indefensible to not prosecute.

At the time of writing, if bought new, the estimated cost would be ~£1500. How much do you think I would be able to sell it for? I was hoping for maybe £1000 all in. Do you think this is reasonable?

1) Private schools get better teachers because they can afford to pay them.

2) State school teachers get paid the same whether they are good or not.

This leads to a situation where all the good teachers are either poached from the public sector or are thinly spread throughout state schools.

The solution is to have grammar schools, where the smarter kids get better teachers who are paid more, concentrating teaching talent. The clever kids just run riot when the teachers are stupider than them, and without real tangible power to discipline there's nothing they can do.

Seems so, yes. There was [a study done by Stanford University](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/september/toddler-language-gap-091213.html) back in 2013 that confirmed something very similar. 

&gt;Language gap between rich and poor children begins in infancy, Stanford psychologists find

&gt;Research by Stanford psychologists reveals that 2-year-old children of lower-income families may already be six months behind in language development. Future work aims to devise intervention methods.

&gt;Fifty years of research has revealed the sad truth that the children of lower-income, less-educated parents typically enter school with poorer language skills than their more privileged counterparts. By some measures, 5-year-old children of lower socioeconomic status score more than two years behind on standardized language development tests by the time they enter school.

&gt;Stanford researchers have now found that these socioeconomic status (SES) differences begin to emerge much earlier in life: By 18 months of age, toddlers from disadvantaged families are already several months behind more advantaged children in language proficiency.

Train tickets are no cheaper than they would be had we not privatised. Services are no better. Delays and problems are at around the same frequency that they were under British Rail. So why are we giving companies £400m in profits to run them? If it's privatised, why are we still subsidising it at all? Sink or swim, right? That's capitalism.

The reality is that should we allow them to sink completely we'd be in all kinds of trouble, so we prop them up, allow them a return to their shareholders and somehow this is better than British Rail just running things? Look at the East Coast line, it was just fine operating at lower marginal costs than their competitors. 

Free Schools are a perfect fit for your freedom argument. ""Why shouldn't people be alllowed to run their local school?"" Makes sense. The evidence shows they cost us more than state schools and perform no better. So surely the question needs to become: ""Why SHOULD we spend this extra money for results that are no better than we can achieve ourselves?"" 

The problem from a ""big picture"" perspective is that the people likely to implement these things are also the people likely to pander too much to the unions.

Please don't try and peddle me the line about all the different types of Islam. The founder practiced this stuff and the basic texts of Islam, Quaran and Hadiths are full of this appaling crap. Nobody should be protected from having their beliefs in this kind of stuff held up to scrutiny against the human rights standards of today.

No, there is a question. I'm asking it right now. Where do you get that all Glaswegians are uneducated violent racists? As I said, Government figures in 2013 showed Scotland had the lowest proportion of people affected by racism in the UK. The figures were 10-15% higher in many parts of England. Surely you would expect these to be higher in Scotland since it's biggest city is full of violent racists?

&gt; which is rare in other Scottish cities. 

Scottish police figures put 'racist incidents' in Glasgow at 20.5 per 10,000 people. In Edinburgh it's 19 per 10,000 people. It's hardly a big gap. Are people from Edinburgh also violent uneducated racists?

&gt;Glasgow =/= Scotland.

And yet it's the biggest city in Scotland. So surely since you're calling 600,000 people, or the majority of them at least, racists, you'd expect these figures to be higher?

It will be hard for him to get a shot. Best case scenario we open the season with two paralel teams in which Hendo-Milner-Cou-Firmino-Benteke play in the league and Can-Ibe-Marko-Ings-Origi-Balotelli get to play cups and Europa. Well, I think that's what's going to happen anyway but best case scenario it also *works*. 

Both of Balotelli and Benteke are the type of attackers who probably play better together with the likes of Markovic and Ibe than Coutinho and Firmino, which is a slight worry for me. But if Benteke can fit into the first team, I think a front three of Markovic-Balotelli-Ibe could really benefit Balotelli. Also, they'll get slightly easier games in the group stage, which hopefully could get him a couple of goals. Right now though, I think we'll probably see more of Ings than Balo.

But basically we're stuck with two options here: play him or loan him out. If he plays very well, we have a world class striker.

Who owns the patents on technology. Who owns the masses of data we create. Increasingly our outputs will be simply living our lives and producing data for advertisers or health care or whatever else we want to throw at a neural net or other data science techniques. And of course who invents the algorithms that are used. 

Also the question of who owns the physical capital of the machines themselves. 

To this end I'd like to see a UK patent store that works to keep useful patents in public use if not ownership. I'd like to see a British Software Corporation set up to solve problems for UK business and provide research and development space as well as support for growing companies. 

I'd also like to see the entire copyright and patents act reviewed to look at increasing the public domain and users rights over data specifically renumeration and ownership of data you create. 

Longer term, it's got to be some kind of UBI. There's no real way around it if you genuinely are likely to hit 50%+ unemployment, but you're talking on scales of 30-50 years away IMO. 

The first step is staying afloat in the automated market. We need investment in logistics. Let's get self driving cars and drones legislation sorted and infrastructure ready, they're less than a decade away. Let's ensure we have world class broadband across the country. Let's help British business invest in productivity enhancing upgrades. Let's ensure the country is supportive of tech industry (yes to coding in schools, no to banning encryption). Let's use government to show the way in back office automation and make the fruits of our labour available to UK businesses. But let's not get caught in the trap of opposing all technological progress as bad for jobs. Wages rise with productivity.

That meant *two thirds* were not controlled by them. One third cannot over-ride two thirds!!!!! EdM was elected in reality because the members were split evenly.

Under the old system, MPs, members and unionists were balloted - but one member's vote counted as much as 1000 union members votes, due to the fact that the unions only counted for a third of the result. And an MP's vote counted most of all. (you had 300 MPs controlling a third of the vote, 200,000 members controlling a third of the vote, and 2 million union voters controlling a third of the vote)

Now one member's vote counts the same as one union supporters vote or one MP's vote.

So David Miliband and his pals, by not understanding basic maths, *have increased the power of the unions* to elect the Labour leader. Hint: 2 million union votes can now over-rule 200,000 members and 236 MPs. Before they couldn't.

They should have accepted the old system - most of the time it worked just fine. All systems give glitches from time to time.

A normal teacher cannot possibly uphold the standards that are expected from an 'Outstanding' lesson in every single lesson of every day in the year. You might be ill, busy trying to meet some other marking or coursework deadline, have things going on in your life at that time etc - any of these things might require you to not put the same amount of effort into a lesson that you might normally want to do.

When they know Ofsted are coming, my teacher friends will spend a whole weekend pretty much making the 4 or 5 lessons they teach on that day the best they possibly can be - you have to 'show engagement and challenge' in your lessons and 'tick' tonnes of other guideline boxes to get a good report. And not all of them even achieve the 'Outstanding' mark that they want even after putting 3-4 hours into a lesson.

You can't possibly expect teachers to put that amount of time into lessons at all times. I agree with your sentiment and I'm sure many teachers that work hard and are good would agree too - but if Ofsted were to make their visits completely random they would need a good common sense adjustment to their expectations.

I don't really trust them or the government when it comes to 'common sense'. If they want teachers to do all the marking/data collection/plenaries/targets/levelling that they do then they need to realise they can't be perfect at all times.

The current system isn't terrible though - I mean teachers and schools *do* get bad reports. It's not like just because they know about the visit they are sure to do a good job. If you're lazy or incompetent it's going to show - however there is a 'middle ground' of teachers that is probably able to come across better than they actually are because of the way Ofsted visits are conducted.",null,0,null,1437916095,null,0,false,0,ctgmnhd,null,t3_3el60q,null,t1_ctgmnhd,null,t1_ctgj1iu,null,null,null,1440093593,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Ed Miliband 	122	15.52%	55,992	15.20%	119,405	19.93%	50.65%

David Miliband	140	17.81%	66,814	18.13%	80,266	13.40%	49.35%

The unions only contributed 19.93% of the 50.65% that Ed Miliband got. That means that 30.72% of his vote came from the MPs and members. It's mathematical illiteracy to believe that 19.93% is a bigger number than 30.72%... And I'm afraid David M's supporters are mathematically illiterate.

If the MPs had been more enthusiastic about David M, MPs plus members would have overwhelmed unions. But it was very close amongst MPs - just 18 separating them. If 19.93% of MPs had gone for David M, they would have neatly offset the unions, and the members would have decided it.

But whatever.  I guess we can overlook all that.

Edit:  More from the Wikipedia link - 

&gt;According to Rudolph Joseph Rummel, the killings done by communist regimes can be explained with the marriage between absolute power and an absolutist ideology – Marxism.[25]

&gt;""Of all religions, secular and otherwise,"" Rummel positions Marxism as ""by far the bloodiest – bloodier than the Catholic Inquisition, the various Catholic crusades, and the Thirty Years War between Catholics and Protestants. In practice, Marxism has meant bloody terrorism, deadly purges, lethal prison camps and murderous forced labor, fatal deportations, man-made famines, extrajudicial executions and fraudulent show trials, outright mass murder and genocide.""[26] He writes that in practice the Marxists saw the construction of their utopia as ""a war on poverty, exploitation, imperialism and inequality – and, as in a real war, noncombatants would unfortunately get caught in the battle. There would be necessary enemy casualties: the clergy, bourgeoisie, capitalists, 'wreckers', intellectuals, counterrevolutionaries, rightists, tyrants, the rich and landlords. As in a war, millions might die, but these deaths would be justified by the end, as in the defeat of Hitler in World War II. To the ruling Marxists, the goal of a communist utopia was enough to justify all the deaths.""[26]

null,false,gamas,,Labour Member,null,"Honestly, people keep painting Ed as if he was left. When it was ridiculously hard to pinpoint what he actually was. He has the same problem that Andy Burnham is exhibiting - his heart is in the right place, but he had absolutely no commitment. As the other guy said, the energy price freeze policy was a bullshit solution to the problem of energy prices.

Skimming the manifesto, with the cynical hindsight lens, I see the following problems (apart from the fact that each section of the manifesto contained 7 pages of ""Tories Tories Tories, Grand Labour Vision, Tories Tories"" and just 2 pages on actual Labour policy):

* ""Cutting the deficit every year and balancing the books over the next parliament"" was an absurd promise. He promised to not only cut the deficit but pay back the national debt. No-one could possibly believe Labour would do that. That would the country to not only somehow go from a £121bn deficit to a surplus within a year, but to somehow pay off £1.2tn in the next 5 years... Not even the Tories were stupid enough to promise to pay off the national debt..

* ""cut and then freeze business rates and maintain the most competitive corporate tax rates in the G7"" - The average voter would have no clue what this even means, and honestly it sounds too vague to actually be a policy.

* ""set up a people-led Constitutional Convention to determine the future of UK’s governance"" - would have actually been an incredibly welcome policy, but for some reason, aside from the one line in the manifesto, never actually got spoken about at all during the campaign...

* ""introduce a compulsory jobs guarantee, paid for by a Bank Bonus Tax"" - was basically meaningless drivel, how do you guarantee a job? And how would taxing bank bonuses help with that? Even supporting basic income would have been more practical than this promise.

* ""give football fans a voice in club boardrooms."" - why? Just why?

* ""guarantee GP appointments within 48 hours and cancer tests within one week"" - is as impractical as the government's weekend GPs idea

Not to mention that Ed kept mentioning these other policies that didn't make it to the final manifesto - what happened to allowing public bodies to bid on rail franchises? 

As an aside: just to add insult to injury, here is a list of policies in Labour's manifesto that actually got implemented in the Tory budget, in a *more generous* form:

* ""abolish non dom status"" (still kept in the new budget, but it is no longer permanent)

* ""increase the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019 and introduce Make Work Pay contracts to provide tax rebates to firms becoming Living Wage employers"" (we all know this one...)

* ""extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds, and ensure all primary schools guarantee access to wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm"" (government went to 30 hours)

Speaking of Tories, I don't actually recall any campaign leaflet sent out by Labour that actually talked about Labour. Every campaign leaflet I received only talked about how evil the Tories were, and how Iain Duncan Smith will come and eat my (hypothetical) babies, and George Osborne would literally genocide the NHS. The Labour campaign simply gave more coverage of Tory policy than on Labour's policy...

And the less said about how Ed handled the SNP situation, the better...

tl;dr An overly weak and non-committal manifesto, combined with overly cynical, negative campaigning (by simply saying ""You should vote us because the other guys are cunts"") made Labour look like a party with no actual substance, and just gave more advertising for the Tories - as we have seen in recent months, negative emotive campaigning simply doesn't work in Europe like it does in the US (I mention the US as Ed hired Obama's campaigns guy)...

That doesn't seem to fit the facts which we are observing. We would expect to observe less abuse in broadcast media and government than in if it is hidden better.

As for convincing UKIP voters, I'm not too sure but it is definitely a possibility. It is possible for someone to oppose the EU, yet politically be left-wing, and until Corbyn there was no left-wing anti-EU voice so UKIP were the only option.

You're right that opinion polls are not always an accurate representation, as if they were we would have a coalition government of some sort right now.

I'm beginning to wonder about that. Pundits always talk about the electorate as if everyone were totally shallow, and just vote for people with ""charisma"" rather than people with policies they agree with. Watching this interview, it seemed clear to me that Corbyn didn't have a politician's body language, his posture was not the open, friendly, straight-backed one you normally see professional politicians wearing. But I think the polished, *trained*, manners and attitude of Blair and Cameron are no longer something the public responds well to. I think the problem with Milliband is that he tried to play the same slick presentation game as Cameron, and couldn't do it as well. Watching Corbyn, I felt like I was watching someone who hadn't been coached by spin-doctors, who actually felt that what he had to say was more important than the way he said it. Maybe I'm a weird outlier, but I found that very attractive politically. 

However well Cameron plays his charismatic ""Call Me Dave"" routine, we all *know* that it's artificial, and the fact that he thinks we'll fall for it is faintly insulting.

The question we're debating is this: 

&gt;One in four (27%) British Muslims say they have some **sympathy for the motives behind the attacks** on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.

Again, and I  have stated this several times now, there's a massive, massive difference between being sympathetic for the reason and agreeing with the action taken. So once again...

Yes it completely does. You can understand why someone did something while disagreeing with their doing of it.

This is the left-wing critique of the EU which Tony Benn, Bob Crow and much of the class-based socialist left subscribes too. I am quite sure that Corbyn believes in it too but doesn't want to alienate more pro-EU Labour members from his campaign.

Which I presume is why they returned David Cameron with more votes and seats than 5 years ago? First time in over 100 years this was to have happened? I know when I voted I wanted a PM who was professional, bright and motivated. DC sure he has a lot of PR stench about him, but this isn't really different from any other person who is high up in any professional organisation. He has to represent the interests and security of 60m people, would we be happy with him turning up to the UN general assembly unshaven wearing his sandals?

I think that sweeping generalisations of the electorate are, for the most part naive/wishful thinking and the same applies to all the people saying that Corbyn is 'unelectable'. I know I certainly wouldn't vote for him, and I don't think much of the country would given past elections over the last 30-40 years. With the incoming boundary changes though, even if Labour were to take back Scotland it needs to eat into a substantial number of tory and UKIP votes to have a chance, is this likely under Corbyn?

&gt; Rummel was a strong supporter of spreading liberal democracy, although he didn't support the invasion of another country solely to replace a dictatorship.[16] Rudolph Rummel talked about the ""miracle"" of liberty and peace, and was an outspoken critic of communism. However, he also criticized right-wing dictatorships and the democides that occurred under colonialism. He had also been critical of past American foreign policy: for example, the Philippine War, the bombing of civilians during World War II and the involvement in the 1900 Battle of Peking.[17] He believed that the U.S. under Woodrow Wilson was a domestic tyranny.[18]

&gt; He strongly supported the current War on Terror and the Iraq War. There is a need, Rummel argued, for an intergovernmental organization of all democracies outside of the United Nations to deal with issues about which the UN cannot or will not act, but particularly to further the promotion of peace, human security, human rights, and democracy—an Alliance of Democracies.[19]

&gt; He also argued that there was a leftist bias in some parts of the academic world that selectively focused on problems in nations with high political and economic freedom and ignored much worse problems in other nations. Related to this, he also criticized the tenure system.[20][21]

Although a good historian will always try their best to remove their personal biases from their writing, he doesn't seem like the most impartial commentator. 

He also argued democracies don't go to war with each other, which just seems to be completely wrong. What was the First World War?",null,0,null,1437920320,null,0,false,0,ctgo71e,null,t3_3enf3a,null,t1_ctgo71e,null,t1_ctgmtq7,null,null,null,1440094320,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

If there are five people, the median income is the third highest/lowest person. If there are 99 people, the median income is that of the fiftieth highest/lowest person.

If there are an even number of people, then you calculate the median income by adding together the incomes of the two middle people then dividing that by two.

For example, if we add a fourth person earning £60k to the group in the first example then the mean income is now £(10k+20k+60k+270k)/4=£90k and the median income is now £(20k+60k)/2=£40k.",null,0,null,1437920383,null,0,false,0,ctgo7yo,null,t3_3encrs,null,t1_ctgo7yo,null,t1_ctgnyav,null,null,null,1440094332,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Ibe is staking his claim for Lallana's spot but I'm not sure he's earned it just yet. Firmino is new to the league and as you mentioned has barely had a pre-season so I don't think he should be thrown in to start this game - especially because we have other very capable options in his position.

Although Benteke has had a similarly short pre-season he knows the PL, he knows Stoke and he will be very important in that match imo.

I'd pick Lucas over Can based on a) Can's limited pre-season and b) Can's lack of game time at DM for LFC. I don't think it's the right game to experiment with him there.

Have just crunched some numbers for you

The MPs split as follows:

EdM 122 46.56%

David M 140 53.44% 

and as the MPs had a third of the college it became

EdM 15.52%

DavidM 17.81%

Now suppose just six MPs (2% of the total) switched from EdM to David M. You would get

EdM 116 44.27%

DavidM 146 55.53%

which becomes

EdM 14.76%

David M 18.51%

Add the 18.51% to the 18.13% DavidM got from the members and the 13.4% he got from the unions and you get 50.1% and victory. 

So the real story wasn't that the 2 million union members ""imposed"" their man on the party, but that the MPs had enormous power within the electoral college, *and refused to use it to give DavidM a decisive mandate*.

Why didn't they? Why did a right-winger like Frank Field choose EdM instead of DavidM. It must be to do with questions of character. If the Blarities had been able to deploy James Purnell instead as their candidate, they'd have won. The reason Purnell didn't stand was because he retired as an MP in 2010 in disgust - because he and Patricia Hewitt put themselves on the line in a pre-arranged plot and reigned from Brown's govt - but David Miliband betrayed them by not doing his bit. So we come back to Miliband's character again.

Firstly make sure the cheque is made out to you (i.e. the payee line has your name as is displayed on any photographic ID you might have) and that they have taken out the crossing on the cheque (i.e. if it says 'A/C payee only' this should be scored out with pen and the payer initial around that area). If this is a personal cheque made out by someone you know/have contact with this should be easy enough if you simply go and ask them to do so, if they havent already. if the cheque has come from elsewhere (HMRC or your place of work/study for example, anywhere a bit more 'corporate') they should still be able to do this but you'll need to get in contact with whichever department distributes these cheques, and it could take a while to get it done.

If you have all this, bring the cheque and your I.D into a branch of the respective bank and they'll be able to help you out. I worked in a UK bank part time for a few years and we didn't charge people for this, but you will need I.D.

A couple of defeats and we ended up folding too early.

Chelsea I don't think will win the league.  Last year they had a pretty easy go of it think, the title will be much closer this year.  i doubt Terry will be as good.  Falcao I'm not sold on.  Best starting XI but I'm not sold on the rest of the squad to be good enough.  

Arsenal surprised they didn't sign Benteke, I think he could easily have been the missing piece to a legit title challenge.  Probably the best overall team (depth wise) Arsenal have had in a few years.  If injuries can be manageable and some players (Ramsey, Coquelin, Ozil) can stay in good form they could be great. Cech was incredible business.  

City I think they are most likely to fall out of top four.  Aguero cannot stay healthy all season.  Pellegrini is on his way out and has very little to play for.  CB's are both highly questionable. 

United are the strangest of the bunch.  Felliani was their best midfielder for stretches last season but unsure where he will fit.  DDG is going to Madrid next season on a free if not this season.  Defense is still a question mark especially CB.  They have europe and will need to play better than they had last season.  I don't think anyone knows what will be United best XI next season.  After Rooney striker is thin.  ;) 

LFC still have defensive issues but look better on paper.  A legit striker will help the team as a whole and if Sturridge can come back and stay healthy for 2016 they could challenge for top 4.  

Spurs.  Alderwiereld (or however you spell it) and Vertonghen is a great CB pairing, something they badly missed.  I think they will finish above Liverpool again.  Their defense will be much improved.  They are moving the dead wood and solidifying a squad.  If they can get a striker to help Kane and maybe take some pressure off of Eriksen they will be a good team.

Mirallas - Looking very hungry and aggressive. Surprise surprise when you have wingers who actually play wide and add width there is more space to attack, Bobby has to see this. Really want Del and Mirallas out wide in week one.

Coleman-  Looked rusty and lethargic in the asian cup but back to his usual self.

Baines - Delivery and passing as good as ever. While I rate Garbutt and Galloway we lose something when Baines is out of the lineup.

Lukaku- Would have loved if that curling volley went in. I remember when he came over people said he had a mental block with PKs but I don't remember missing one for us. Looking very comfortable.

Howard,Stones,Jags - Not much to do.

Osman - Looking alright but I am never a fan of him out wide.

Barry - Sloppy and looking old. At this point he should only be injury cover or in cup games where we run out some youth. Would rather see Barkley, Clevs or Besic than him in that position.

Kone - Fucking awful.

Subs I'd like to See: Naismith for Kone, Clevs for Barry, Barkley for Osman. Switch to a 4-3-3

The self-loathing white liberal, proprietor of the doctrine of political correctness. The caricature Guardian reading leftie who is too uncomfortable to discuss the sensitive issues re race or religion, the type that is so PC that they'd sooner act as apologists for rapists than reflect on the possible cultural aspects of a crime.

You're the kind of person who made me reticent to identify as liberal. The PC pussy brigade who purport to stand for liberalism, yet whose actions don't at all reflect it.

I've cited you studies showing that political correctness played a role, the fact that you dismiss them shows your true fucking colours.

Yes, cite me an opinion piece from one journalist in a newspaper, and another which speculates on why what happened went on for so long.

There are a myriad of different reasons why it continued for so long. Political correctness was clearly one of them, why do you refuse to acknowledge this?

Why? Answer me that one question.

&gt;It is obvious to me that there is a problem with paedophiles all over our society, from politicians to cabbies..

&gt;But confirmation bias means you will only see what you want to see.

You're a fucking joker. Yours' is the fucking confirmation bias. I'm focusing on reality, you're wilfully ignoring it.

If you'd bothered to look at my second fucking link, you'd see that this issue of grooming gangs targeting young girls, which CEOP describes as 'Type 1' offenders, is very specific to men of ""South Asian Muslim Origin"", as you can see yourself here:

&gt;The Jay report into failings in Rotherham says: **“By far the majority of perpetrators were described as Asian by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue.**

&gt;“Some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem, which they hoped would go away. **Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.”**

&gt;Ceop data about the ethnicity of offenders and suspects identified by those 31 police forces in 2012 is incomplete.

&gt;The unit says: “All ethnicities were represented in the sample. **However, a disproportionate number of offenders were reported as Asian.”**

&gt;**Of the 306 offenders whose ethnicity was noted, 75 per cent were categorised as Asian**, 17 per cent white, and the remaining 8 per cent black (5 per cent) or Arab (3 per cent).

&gt;Ceop identified 144 victims of the Type 1 groups. Again, the data was incomplete. Gender was mentioned in 118 cases. All were female. Some 97 per cent of victims were white.

&gt;The 27 court cases that we found led to the convictions of 92 men. Some 79 **(87 per cent) were reported as being of South Asian Muslim origin.**

http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-grooming-gangs/18739

Explain that away you fucking halfwit.

""*But white people.. Jimmy Saville..*"" etc etc.

Here we have a specific problem, with cold hard facts to demonstrate it.

Cowardly shithouses like yourself with an aversion to discussing race are the very reason thousands of girls up and down this country have been sexually assaulted for years by predators with little fear of repercussion.

null,false,DELB_,,I take it back. I'm backing Corbyn.,null,"A strong advocate of what the Labour Movement is about.  It simply isn't just a buzzword or a catchphrase -- it is a real movement that protects workers' rights and supports trade unions (well, it used to very much, but not now).

I believe in the end goal of what Labour needs to achieve and that is: a fair society, social justice, equality, opportunity, co-operation, a strong NHS, housing and welfare.

I also hate the Tories because to me, they will always be the nasty party and the way Thatcher treated people in the '80s was despicable.

But to answer your question, the Lib Dems and the Greens live in some sort of idealist, pragmatic, hopeful society -- to a certain extent my belief with the Greens and Lib Dems is like what /u/Patch86UK said.  They're all bark and no bite, they don't really actually think how they're going to implement things, they just will say things to people who want a happy world and, as we all know, the world is far, far from it.

I am a bit of a leftie though and Labour isn't particularly a far-left party anymore, in some ways I think you have to go to the center to win an election but I also kind of like the idea of socialism and removing class struggle but, it would take years to do and is again just simply an idealist way of thinking and before Labour start to get anywhere the Tories will be back in so it's pointless to dream about it.

Plus, Labour were the ones who gave us the NHS, social housing and welfare as well as free education for everyone until 15 and a whole lot more (with R.A. Butler who was a Tory).  I can't say the Tories have done much for our society to make it more civilised (even though Cameron likes to take credit for it ;)).

Then add 500g of beef mince, and cook it until it's brown, trying to break it up with the wooden spoon so it doesn't go lumpy. Then add a tin of chopped tomatoes, a bit of tomato puree and four crushed beef Oxo cubes. You can also add red wine or Worcester sauce to taste.

I am still not quite grasping your point. Lets say for the sake of argument that sex abuse in broadcast media is at the same level as in the fast food industry. I don't see anything to indicate that its better hidden in broadcast media. I don't see how recent discoveries affect this. Rather, if the abuse levels are equal then is seems to be hidden *less* well in broadcast media.

Why on Earth would there be a greater proportion among the poor? Studies of sexual behaviour indicate that sexual mores tend to be more conservative in working classes, and more liberal among richer, more educated people. 

My point isn't as crass as 'toffs are pervy'. I think if you isolate adolescent boys away from girls, families, and external authorities, in a situation in which there is a strict hierarchy based on age, with younger boys expected to perform menial services for older ones, then I think that's quite a fertile ground for abuse of younger boys by older ones. It does seem to be the case that sexual abuse in boarding schools is more common than we would hope, as a quick google will reveal.

They're willing to pay to prop up Ukraine, but not Greece? 

Besides the idea that they're just giving taxpayers money away to Greece is grossly inaccurate - these aren't gifts they're loans! Loans which creditors make a substantial profit from! 

They're demanding Greece take on more loans, more debts, fully aware that they can't pay them back, because the alternative is to make the sensible debt-write off's the IMF and others have argued for, which would then lead to ""political contagion"" in other states like Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and so on. This is what Greece is about, not economics.

&gt; Therefore it was either harsh austerity or leaving the Euro, those were the two options available

Of course not! The other option is to partially write off Greek debts to a payable level, fund a massive stimulus program, and bring in a 20 or 30 year grace period allowing Greece to recover from the austerity-induced collapse of their economy before starting paying it's debts back. But because that would risk political contagion, and would send the wrong message to big banks who hold Greek debt (in particular Deutsche Bank) it cannot even be considered despite being the most rational course of action.

If you have a situation where even Labour members who are usually pro-EU and progressive starting to question our relationship with the EU, then we've got problems.

But here's Tony Benn on the treaty:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da8ZuF2LSGU.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/how-to-reduce-eu-democratic-deficit

Nigel Farage talks about when The 'first elected' 'Prime-Minister' actually told Ireland it would be inappropriate for them to hold a general election: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gm9q8uabTs, I'm no fan of Farage but I think he's spot on here, asking a member state to defer its own democratic process is morally repugnant. 


This is a more balanced view of the EU:http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21588381-seeking-confront-rise-eurosceptics-and-fill-democratic-deficit-democratic


The problem is that the Commission is responsible for introducing legislation, not the European Parliament.  Most democratic systems work completely the other way round, Parliament introduces legislation to their house, this will be voted on and go either to an upper house or ratification or be enacted as law.  The issue of the ECHR is separate but linked to the EU too, forcing Governments to enact legislation based on its own rulings, rather than from the process in each members legal system.  The recent equal marriage law came about in this way, it should have been made clear that equal marriage is legal in the EU constitution really.


&gt;Just last year we had the first elected Prime Minister of the EU,


This is either disingenuous, or you're simply ignorant of how the EU works, previous to 2009 and the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon (Ireland was ordered to rerun its referendum after a No vote of course), member states each took a turn on the Presidency of the EU and it rotated.  After the treaty the the permanent position of European President was formed, it isn't the President of the EU Parliament, it's the President of the commission which is also head of the EU (the most senior official in the EU is President of the Commission).  Jean-Claude Junker was the second person to hold this position (that was the election last year you remember but it wasn't the first time). Donald Tusk serves as President of The Council their is no 'Prime Minister' of the EU, the EU doesn't use the Westminster system. Some people may even compare the EU Parliament to the US Senate, which isn't a very good comparison either.


In any case the EU doesn't allow the citizens of member states to vote on anything other than their MEP's, creating a huge disconnect between the Elected and the electorate, making the EU appear distant and unconcerned with the nearly 500 million people it is supposed to represent, whether that's legitimate concern or not is up for debate, but most people in the EU probably have very little knowledge on how the EU works and who the main figures are that control it.  Though an election of a President through direct democracy could be difficult since the size of states differs dramatically with 80 million in Germany through to the less than 1 million in Luxembourg.  


&gt;giving more power to the Parliament.

I don't think there's been a fundamental shift towards democracy at all, since the EU has evolved more in the direction of taking powers away from individual states and moved them towards the Commission, ECHR and ECB, the system is inherently flawed in this respect, ideally the system would replace the Commission to a civil service wholly subservient on Council where the MEP's sit, a more unified Council would form, and they would elect a single cabinet with a single President as the de-facto head of state, but each member state would remain in control of its sovereignty, but maintain agreements in trade, migration and defense.  The EU was initially supposed to form a simple trading agreement with the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community, designed to end war in Europe and resource based wars within.  If the EU even needs to head towards more democracy then it's clear that it's lacking in that department now, and that should have never been the case.


&gt;The Greek situation is about a country whose poor decisions have lead Europe into throwing good money after bad.

Well I thought we were all one big happy family in Europe and all in this together, it's odd how easily people abandon this camaraderie as soon as a member state transgresses its place.  As you seem rather unclear on past news stories (you believed Jean-Clauder Junker was the first 'Prime-Minister of Europe after all), I'll remind you that in 2008 there was a huge market crash, this lead to many countries simply running out of money.  There were issues within Greece regarding tax avoidance, mismanagement of money and recieved loans and the fact even being part of the EU made investors see Greece as less volatile than it really is.  Unfortunately this has led to devaluation of pensions, a banking crisis and the need to take in loans from the IMF, the EU, and other countries in the EU.  


There was an issue when whilst at the same time as demanding Greece pays its debt, Germany is profiting hugely from the spending on defence Greek manages http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military-spending-debt-crisis.  This all smacks of Germany throwing its weight around Europe once more, despite having a limited military, though they can use money rather than Blitzkrieg to bring opponents to their knees these days.  It might be of interest that after WWII, despite the huge atrocities Germany committed on The Continent, many members of Europe decided to forgive large amounts of debt Germany owed so that it could back on its feet and enjoy being the industrial and economic power house it is today.  I guess the reason people forgave the debt was because they didn't want to see the country go under and that Germany had changed government.  

This leads me back to Greece, a country with an electorate that decided the current government wasn't up to the task of running the country, the previous government had mislead the EU over its debt, so ultimately the Left-Wing Syrzia was elected into parliament to try and sort this mess out.  Greek politics are very difficult though with many coalitions, from parties with widely differing ideologies.  


&gt;If you're talking about a referendum


Says who? You?  Debts shouldn't mean a country hands over sovereignty or how it decides to run it's society to a bunch of unelected money lenders, that's entirely wrong, it's undemocratic and immoral.  The main issue for a lender is getting the money back, and since we (me and you) are supposed to have a belief that left wing economics can work and can make money, surely Syriza should be given a chance to reform its economy and attempt to pay the money owed back, this is supposed to be a crisis, I would hope that Europe would understand that and understand that it is going to be difficult for Greece to make its payments and that its first responsibility is to its citizens, not the IMF, Germany or the ECB.  In the end the 60% no vote in the referendum meant nothing,  60% of the Greek people did not want to submit to the bail out conditions, and ultimately wanted to walk away from the Eurozone (the monetary union, not the EU as a political entity).  I think if we've learnt one thing from the economic crisis, it's that in the 21st century you don't have to fire a shot to get a country to surrender, as long as it's in debt you can kill or displace its citizens (20'000 people were made homeless in Greece, suicides have shot up in Britain during the worst of austerity), and eventually a signing a contract for a loan has become nothing less than a declaration for surrender. 

&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32332221

There's some more info in the above site there, but I wanted to point out the issues Greece has, even being in the Eurozone, which doesn't allow for debt forgiveness or debt restructuring.  So your points about debt negotiations has some validity, but only within the Eurozone, a country outside the EU would be well within its rights to handle its own debt, in its own way.  

&gt;You wouldn't get relief on your unpayable mortgage because you balloted your family on the issue, after all.

Unless you're George Osborne Please don't compare the treasury and national budgets to your house or shopping list.  The two things are nothing alike and it sounds stupid when the Chancellor of the Exchequer does it (who should know better), and it doesn't sound any better when you do it.  You could well be within your rights to seek out a new mortgage, renegotiate or even miss a payment but repay a larger amount later on, and the bank wouldn't insist that it takes your washing machine, tells you when you could sleep with your wife, what type of baked beans to buy and insist you only use special bank issued tokens on the other hand.

But the bailout conditions placed on Greece are entirely different, reduction of minimum wage, 50 billion Euros in assets to be held by Europe to be 'privatised', more cuts,more changes to union laws.  This is the difference between a household budget and a national budget, a national budget is tied explicitly to the democracy of a country and should serve all of its citizens, and is both dependent on what the citizens pay in tax, what services they get in return and should be democratically controlled by the citizens.  Your personal budget is entirely different, it serves you, only you pay in and only you get something in return, your responsible for no one else but yourself and yes maybe your family, but its nothing like moving money around to cover defence spending, regional development, welfare, health, receiving money from government assets and tax, whilst being scrutinised by government and the electorate on your performance with that money.

What does that mean? 

""A fair society"" sounds great. 

Everyone wants things to be fair. It's just entirely subjective. Should I be penalised for having a great job? Is it *fair* that the government take over half of my negotiated salary? If I run a business that makes a nice profit is it *fair* that the government taxes that profit before it even becomes my income? Is it *fair* that my father worked hard all his life, paid all his taxes and now when he dies he gets taxed **again** just for not spending it all? That his home went up in value during the 50 years he lived in it wasn't his fault, why is he being penalised unfairly? Is it *fair* that the government taxes me for trying to give someone a job, who is that fair *for* other than the treasury? Not me, not the people I can't employ because the costs are 14% on top of salary.

I would agree that housing needs sorting, but I'm guessing you mean you want a lot more social housing so those on low or no income have somewhere to live. That's fine, let's not go back to homelessness and workhouses (and the privatised housing system we have now is just daft). 

People can remain in their council houses long after they no longer need the help. How is that *fair*? For either the people coming behind who need the help, or for those who would fucking *love* some subsidised rent so they can save for a deposit. How is it *fair* that these people get to buy homes those of us who have worked and rented privately could only dream of at a *huge* discount? How is that not the antithesis of fairness?

This season will be tough for us; despite strengthening, our squad is not deep enough for a good Europa run and the Premier League.  I wouldn't be shocked to see us make the Europa group stages but also flirt with the relegation battle (not a serious chance of actually getting relegated, though)  -  or get knocked out of Europa before the group stages and coast to another upper mid-table finish.  I'd like to see us in the top 10 (realistic), and dream of top 6 (less so, but as a West Ham fan I'll continue to blow bubbles).

2. 
OK, so most other people are saying Sakho/Payet.  I agree that that's going to be a partnership to watch, but I'll throw in a surprise contender: Andy Fucking Carroll.  Yeah, so he's been injured for more games than not as a West Ham player so far, but that means no one is expecting anything from him.  If he can pull together a substantial injury-free run he'll shock everyone by proving he's still a force to be reckoned with. I did say exactly the same thing this time last season before Andy got a couple more injuries, so.... we'll see.

3. Lineup might be:

Adrian

Cresswell Reid Tomkins Jenkinson

Noble Kouyate

Valencia Payet Lanzini

Sakho

I'd expect to see a lot of rotation in the CBs (Reid, Tomkins, Ogbonna, Collins) and I'd also expect at least one youth player to break through and get some headlines (likely one of Poyet, Samuelsen, Cullen, Oxford, maybe Burke).

&gt; I’ve knocked too many doors where somebody has told me they don’t know what the Scottish Labour Party stands for. Under my leadership no one will be in any doubt as to what our Party stands for and who we stand with.

&gt; ***That every person, family and community has potential.***

&gt; * That the power of government can help everybody achieve their potential, no matter the barriers and no matter the odds.

&gt; * That education liberates people. Access to it is life’s great equaliser.

&gt; * That tackling inequality should not mean being opposed to either individual achievement or wealth creation.

&gt; * That power and wealth should be redistributed for the common good.

&gt; * That people working together will always achieve more than they can alone.

&gt; * That movements of people, organising around our values and principles, change the world. It is the only thing that ever has.

But that's what they're doing!

&gt; Well yes &amp; no. While technically loans they become more like gifts when the host nation has no hope of paying it back. 

Knowingly lending money to a bankrupt entity is illegal in most normal countries, so I dunno how they expect to be able to justify that.

&gt; You have to remember these proposals have to get past national governments too. Saying there needs to be debt write off is rather pointless when it's not politically feasible to do so. 

But it's not feasible to expect Greece to pay off loans when it has no money! You can talk about the national governments and their mandates all you like but that won't change the fact you can't get blood from a stone!

&gt; Also bear in mind if the EU didn't ask for austerity the loans to Greece would be much greater &amp; their debt much greater. 

This is factually incorrect. Austerity has increased the Greek debt whilst destroying what little chance they ever had of paying it back. If the governments of these countries were interested in making sure they get at least *some* of their loaned money back then a debt-write off is going to be necessary, as well as a long grace period to allow the Greek economy to recover from the disaster of austerity. The fact they're willing to lose money in the long term shows that ultimately this isn't an economic decision, the economic argument for Greek austerity is none-existant, but it's a political lesson. 

This is basically the local gangster loanshark (Germany) taking one of their indebted punters (Greece) out into the ghetto where everyone else (Spain, Italy, etc) can see them and giving them a savage beating, so that everyone knows what happens to people who don't pay the debts and who resist austerity. That's a political, not an economic, act. 

&gt;What you're essentially saying is Merkel needs to say to her populace we need to give Greece hundreds of billions of Euros as a gift. How do you think that would go down?

Well it's either that or Greece defaults on the lot, which would cost the Holy German Taxpayer even more money.

Besides these Germans owe their current success to the masses of money and debt they walked away from in the 20th century, so if we can accept writing off German debt after they'd bombed us and attacked us they can accept it for Greece. If not I'd like to see Germany practice what it preaches and start paying back some of the vast amounts of money that we and the other allied debtor nations are owed from Versailles onwards.

&gt; Yes these are all fanciful things you're saying.

This is IMF's own economic advice? Are you saying that the IMF is some kind of utopian, marxist, pie-in-the-sky organisation committed to unrealistic spending? Are you for real? 

The fanciful thing is expecting austerity to produce growth, despite 7 years of evidence that it doesn't work. 

&gt;If we had a money tree we'd do it. 

There's no shortage of magic money trees when we're bailing out banks, or pumping billions into the Eurozone economy via quantitative easing, or when we're paying for illegal wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, or when we're funding the corrupt Ukrainian regime that's destroying it's own country etc etc. ",null,0,null,1437926646,null,0,false,0,ctgr23f,null,t3_3elspl,null,t1_ctgr23f,null,t1_ctgqnl2,null,null,null,1440095669,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

Ward and Gayle were very poor. Ward's passing was particularly bad as was his mistake for the second goal. Gayle was just anonymous on the wing.

Mutch showed promise with some great runs and passing. Looks to have a good shot on him.

Souare was our best player. Solid defensively and his excellent crosses gave us our best chances

Cabaye was quite quiet but his class is evident - seems to nearly always pull off the perfect pass

Murray did his usual but was pretty isolated up front. He needs Bolasie and Zaha to play to be effective in the box

McCarthy had a mixed first game. Some good saves and catches helpe his case but he made a poor mistake for the first goal (he pushed the ball from a free kick onto the post but it bounced off, hit him and went in) and though it got better his distribution wasn't great. Patience needed here.

Overall, not the worst performance. We were let down by two mistakes against a good team who gave us the competitive game we needed.

You may be able to pay a fee to ""fix"" the offer for a period of around 3 months. This gives you time to make offers on houses and complete sales. You'll engage solicitors to complete the legal work. I used to deal with this a lot but its been 8 years out of the game, but back then I would usually be looking around a grand for legal fees.

You guys have no chain (you don't need to sell) which is a bonus. The bigger the chain the longer it can typically take to get everyone to line up for exchanges.

Might bear in mind most mortgage companies want to see some employment history, so if you're both very new in employment it may exclude you from some offers.

Werner is more likely but as he's 19 we don't know how good he could end up being. We could have another Lamela situation where we buy the player and hope he comes good in his third season...

Not saying that's the case but if we're only going to have two strikers (Soldado and Ade both seem on the way out) i would hope our second is established and veteran. I would love Werner, him signing would definitely make me very very happy, I just think we need someone else in addition to him to make sure if Kane gets injured and Werner isn't acclimating we have another backup.

In brief...

1. Go to your bank or building society now.  Get an appointment with their mortgage advisor.  They will be able to give you an indication of how much you can borrow from them.  Remember, your bank will only advise you on *their own* products. You'll want to do a search of the whole market later.

2. Decide where you want to live.  Easier said than done!  Register on Zoopla, RightMove, OnTheMarket and search for homes you'd like.

3.  You should now be in a position to understand what you can get for your money.  Ask estate agents to show you around some properties.  You're under no obligation to buy - but it'll give you an idea of whether you want a flat, a house, something you can fix up, near to a station, etc.

4. Either go to a mortgage broker or to a comparison website and choose the sort of mortgage you want.  Do you want to fix the rate for several years?  Something you can offset with savings?  Ask the mortgage provider for a ""Decision in Principle"".  This is a document which says ""Yes, we're happy to lend you the money - assuming you meet our conditions.""  You can show this to estate agents to let them know that you're serious.

5. Under *no circumstances* go to a mortgage broker recommended / provided by the estate agent.  They do not work for you, they are only interested in making the agency commission!

6. Put an offer on a house.  You've seen one you both like, which is in your price range.  You ring up the estate agent and put an offer in.  This can be for the full asking price, or you can risk going lower.  Or, you can offer more.  The estate agent passes the offer on to the sellers.

7.  Find a conveyancer.  This is a special type of solicitor who will help you buy a house.  Look online for reviews of local ones.  Go and chat to them. Find out how much they charge (a lot) and how quickly they work (slowly).

8.  The estate agent tells you that the seller has accepted your offer (or that they want more money).  This means **nothing**.  Under English law, the seller can withdraw right up until all the legal proceedings have concluded.  Nothing is set in stone yet.

9.  At this point, you leave everything in the hands of your conveyancer.  They deal with the sellers lawyers, perform all the legal searches etc.

10.  You will need a survey done on the house.  All mortgage providers insist on this.  Don't scrimp on it.  Hopefully it will tell you if the place is about to fall down.  Based on this information, you may choose to lower your price or withdraw.

11.  It's ok to ask the sellers if you can pop round to measure for curtains, make sure the taps work etc.

12.  Assuming everything goes ok - and it almost certainly *won't* - your lawyer talks to their lawyer and the mortgage company.  They propose an ""exchange"" date.  That is, when legal contracts are exchanged.  You can both pull out any time before the contracts are exchanged.

13. As part of this, you'll set a completion date.  That is, you've exchanged contracts - but you'll actually pay the money and take possession on a later date.  That can be the next day, or a few months from now.  It depends on what you negotiate.

14. You sign lots of paperwork.  You have lots of frantic phone calls.  You curse your lawyers.  Everything eventually muddles through and you pick up the keys from the estate agent.  Then the boiler explodes and you wonder why you even bothered ;-)

That is the *very* brief and optimistic scenario.  There are a huge number of things which can go wrong.  [Buy a book about the process](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;fst=as%3Aoff&amp;keywords=buy%20a%20house&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1437927118&amp;rh=n%3A266239%2Cn%3A64%2Ck%3Abuy%20a%20house&amp;rnid=1025612&amp;tag=shkspr-21), speak to local conveyancers, chat to friends and relatives.

null,false,CaptainHayashi,,Labour Member | Corbyn/Eagle,null,"Labour is the only realistic shot at progressive policies we have.  It's large, established, well-known, and has a deep history of getting things done (NHS, welfare state, minimum wage, British Rail).

I'd put myself as being borderline hard-left, but, while I would have subscribed to the original Clause 4, I agree with every word of the Blair C4 and honestly think it sums the purpose of Labour up far better.  It sums up the ends I think Labour should always work towards, while leaving the means up to the broad church.

The broad-church principle might be causing a lot of flare-ups and tension at the moment, but in theory it keeps a lid on what /u/Patch86UK said: if Corbyn wins, the moderates and opposition inside the party will scrutinise everything the party does to make sure we don't drift off into unicorn land.  Even if Kendall wins, the left will (hopefully) stick around to offer debate and alternative viewpoints, as they always have.  (EDIT: In _practice_, I think the party could do a lot better at using the broad church, since a lot of the leadership contest has been YOU GET OUT OF THE PARTY _NO YOU GET OUT OF THE PARTY_)

We need a player that at least somewhat fills the Suarez/Sterling void, and although Reus would be the perfect fit (especially if he's seeking a team where he can be the star), everyone is very pessimistic about our chances of signing him and seem very sure he'll stay at BVB. I see why it would appear ludicrous, but they just came off of a fairly bad season by their standards and made some major changes to the club... Why would he want to stay? In my opinion, for a player seeking to be the main man at a large club, we would make the most sense right now. All large clubs have players that may overshadow him at the moment: Bayern (Lewandowski), Juve (Pogba), PSG (Ibra), Barca and Real (obvious), and every other major English club have key players that Reus would struggle against for the spotlight...

York does has its good points, but frankly the bad points outweigh the good.

Other than the Minster and the excellent railway museum, York has nothing particularly interesting. And no, a very old wall is not that interesting, it's still just a wall. York is just a chocolate box town designed for tourists, it really just a has a feel of artificiality about it (isn't this exactly what the Victorians did to it?). Unless you're a history fanatic then the majority of what York claims to offer is pretty irrelevant.

The landscape is flatter than a pancake. I hate this. It drives me crazy that there is no scenery or elevation or anything in York. I want a nice view! Not necessarily of rolling hills or whatever, but anything to make it feel less claustrophobic than constantly seeing only the ground, walls, or the sky. And not that York is even that big...

It's way too small. Sure, if you're just there for a weekend visit it's lovely. But if you live or work there then after a few months you're bored of it. There is nothing to do and nowhere to go. I find it funny that a major selling point of York is that it is well connected to other, more interesting places - York is good because you can leave York to better places?

There are three types of people in York: 1) Tourists, which are a nuisance, 2) students, which are annoying, and 3) local chavs, which are obnoxious.

And the pubs! Yes, the pubs are good if you like paying extortionate prices whilst mingling with pisshead students. OK, some pubs are quite enjoyable there (the Red Lion on Fossgate is a personal favourite) but the average price of a pint in York is around 4 pounds (well, between £3-£5). If you're from the South that might be the normal price, but I can tell you in the North it's not.

In fact everything is expensive in York, probably because 90% of people there are wealthy students or tourists.

As a Northerner who comes from a (perhaps I am biased here) beautiful part of the North West, where prices are cheap and people are ""real"", when I went to study in York I felt angry that all the other students (mostly foreign or from the South, London specifically) would lecture me on how beautiful (and cheap!!) York was. Well perhaps it is compared to London, but for the rest of England, especially compared to where I come from, it's an average place that I have no particular interest in revisiting in the future.",null,1,null,1437928732,null,0,1437933944,0,ctgs64q,null,t3_3en6xq,null,t1_ctgs64q,null,t1_ctgjwid,null,null,null,1440096193,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

It doesn't really make sense to throw such a googly at the end of Season 21 by having the sixth doctor appear for just one story with a bizarre unpleasant character and then have people wait around for months to see what was coming next.

In my opinion, the show rapidly deteriorated at this point - not because of Colin's acting (he was just doing what he was told to do) but because of the scripts, the production, and that Coco the Clown god-awful costume.

I feel sorry for the guy, but find it hard to believe there was a Sixth Doctor masterplan.

With Capaldi they were brave - introducing a potentially unlikeable character.

After school the kids of the rich have a network of parental contacts who can offer extra opportunities, advise them about how to write a cover letter or UCAS statement , tell them how to behave in an interview, etc... Even before school advantages are ingrained. If you read the report there's the rather depressing fact that children from richer backgrounds are already performing better in cognitive tests at the age of five. This is because their parents can afford to spend more time with them, are more likely to read to them, etc...

I think you're being harsh on Lamela and pessimistic re: Werner. Lamela has shown numerous times it is the pace and physicality of the PL which he has not adjusted to, which is expected coming from a very tactical Italian league. His footballing skills are quite sublime and there isn't an argument there. But your reluctance to give Werner a chance because he's foreign and could possibly be like another supposedly ""failed"" signing is absurd.

In order to better explain how this contest works, here are some more details:
- there is not a deadline for the submission of your stories. The first version of the game will contain 6 levels based on 6 stories created by us. After that, we will add more levels basing on your stories. This will be a game built with the creative
support of the community.
-In order to avoid any copyright problem it would be better to limit any reference to Weeping Angels, sonic screwdriver, cracks in the structure of time and Time Lords.

I publish below the stories for the first 3 levels of the game, I hope it can help you to write your own fantastic story (and let me know what you think about it):

1: The Dark Planet
The planet is dark and rocky. Around you some grey dust keeps falling down and you cannot breath. Explosions in the black sky remind you where you are here: the Cursed planet, in the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy. \n
It is a planet at the border of the known universe, the same universe that is exploding around you right now! \n
Too many cracks in the structure of time have compromised our world and you are the only survivor, witness of the last moments of the universe. \n
\n
Something is with you, you can feel its evil presence: angel statues, the Weeping Angels. 
They move really fast and with a simple touch they can send you in another place and time. Wait! Maybe it is not too late! Maybe you can revert it all, you are a Time Lord!\n
\n
Weeping Angels cannot move while you look at them and you are the only chance now for the survival of our universe; if you can avoid their touch, you can fix the cracks in time and space around you with your sonic screwdriver. Weeping Angels will do all they can to stop you, they are the guardians of the cracks.


2: The Room
You are in an empty room and you cannot remember how you came here. A moment ago you were on the dark planet, running away from a Weeping Angel and now…It looks like a small, abandoned apartment. For sure this is planet Earth. \n
Walking around you admire old dusty books, wooden table, closets and paintings on the walls. They remember you all the people who used to leave on planet Earth, it is so sad. \n
A rumour makes you realise you are not alone in the room, something is moving in the darkness. You have to be quick, take your screw driver and fix the cracks around you. \n
Something is wrong, the screwdriver is silent, powerless you need to recharge it. The noise you heard before is getting closer, something is hiding in the next room. 

3: The Cliff
Seagulls crying and ocean waves roaring close to you, that means you are still alive! It is a cliff, you are on a cliff now. It is night, you can see the moon reflected on the surface of the ocean, and close by  an old abandoned lighthouse. \n
There are many cracks to be fixed around you and the weeping angels are hiding for sure. \n
You are tired and you would like to stay there for hours starring at the ocean.\n
You cannot even walk properly because the time travelling has consumed too much energy. You need some energy if you want to keep saving the universe. Something is blinking far away, behind the lighthouse. You can see a blue light, a sphere..it must be what you were looking for….

The Commission may also consider the balance between the need to maintain public access to information, and the burden of the Act on public authorities, and whether change is needed to moderate that while maintaining public access to information.

French trains are nationalised and they are absolutely appalling. Our train was 1 hour 30 minutes late, with no explanation or apology or refund. No-one was angry because this is just par for the course. Looking at the arrivals board indicated that there were about 5 others that were similarly late.

French conductors apparently accept tickets from previous and next trains without question because this is so common, though we didn't test that theory.

I'll never complain about British trains again. You can say what you like about them but if they were consistently 1 and a half hours late they'd bid for the renewal of the contract and another company would surely get it.

People tend to recommend Blink quite often.  But, brilliant as it is, it doesn't really act well as good introduction to Doctor Who because it is so atypical, with the good Doctor hardly in it.

My recommendation would be for ""The Eleventh Hour"", which is a great kick-off point for any starter with no prior knowledge of Doctor Who.

If that doesn't float your boat, ""Girl in the Fireplace"" is exquisite.  Great design, beautiful and imaginative writing, a heart-breaking ending that will make people want to see more, and a horse on a spaceship.
