No I havn't conflated clarkson with arms and drug dealing, your missing the point, if you read the comment (perhaps a few times), you'll finally realise the comparisons are linked to the arguments of taxation, and where money is invested, for example war and the arms trade.
The comment on drugs was in relation to the point i made:

&gt;understand the difference between principles and profit.

Please don't tell me you need that annotating for you.

&gt;That's just reductio ad absurdum and it makes your argument look silly

No it's not reductio ad absurdum, if you think I'm trying to make a connection between the arms trade/drug dealing and Jeremy Clarkson, then you're either not bothering to read and understand what I'm writing or you're a troll.

&gt;because you need hyperbole to back it up.

Err, what? I don't need evidence do I not? just hyperbole.

&gt;I definitely disagree with war and the way it drives economies but that doesn't mean that I'm not allowed to enjoy Clarkson's turn of phrase and sense of irony

Yea this just clarifies how far the point went over your head.

&gt;You'd like comedy to be full of Michael Macintyre clones

No I wouldn't, he annoys me beyond belief.

&gt;And I would rather Frankie Boyle beat him to death with Jeremy Clarkson's autobiography. On Youtube.

Ok, well done you, Frankie Boyle is far better than Clarkson, at least he seems to understand satire miles more than that racist cunt Clarkson.

&gt;I've also lived and worked outside of UK for over 20 years and can definitely confirm that racism is a two way street

Really... is this you showing your apologist colours for Clarkson now, because is a bit of a tangent from the initial points we've discussed.
Racism actually has very different forms and representations throughout history, and actually isn't quite the same as what you mean, depending on where you are in history, but I'm not gonna discuss that idea to any depth with you, when you seem to be struggling with basic analogies I've made.

&gt; It's part of life and it will never go away, no matter how many windmills you tilt your lance at.

Yea, guess we could say that about all sorts of crime. That's not an excuse to not confront it, let alone ride along with it and act as an apologist vanguard

**Liverpool**: Play 2 QPR(H) and Hull (A).

 I think QPR will be dead and buried by the time we play them, but Hull away could be difficult if they're pulled back into the scrap (currently 3 points above the red line)

**United**: Play 2/3 if we count Everton in the relegation battle. 

Villa(H), Hull(A), Everton (A). Their final day is away against Hull, could be crucial with one team fighting for 4th and the other fighting to stay up. 

**Arsenal**: Play 3. Burnley (A) Hull(A) Sunderland (H). 

Thinking they may drop points against Burnley away. Sunderland also have a new manager and may be going through their ""dead cat bounce"" phase. 

**Southampton**: Play 6! Burnley(H) Everton(A) Hull (H) Leicester (A) Villa (H). 

Given their general slowdown there's a lot of potential for dropped points even though they have the fewest matches against Top 6. 

**Spurs**: Play 5. Leicester (H) Burnley (A) Villa (H) Hull (H) Everton (A).

 Personally I think their race has been more or less run. They were abject against United.

1) It's irrelevant. FGM can be seen as a systematic abuse of women and their sexuality, but most importantly it's a genital mutilation of a child which impacts negatively on their life

and

2) A lot of FGM does not stop sexual pleasure, yet is still (rightly) condemned just as heavily.

ISIS certainly are scumbag murderers, to think they are the only ones in the area is really quite naive though.

2. Which brings me onto the Kurds really, and this relaxed use of the word terrorism, our previous governments certainly considered Kurdish elements (who we currently support fighting ISIS) as terrorists, which is why our government along with others backed Turkish oppression of Kurds.

3. As for terrorism itself, you seem to be semantically litigious in your explanations, and there's nothing wrong with that especially in the context of international affairs and geopolitics.

In fact, look at the BBC story on this same issue (can't link on my phone). What the story *actually* is is MSP's voting to stop determining their salaries based on MP's salaries, which means theirs will go up by 0.7% instead of over three percent that MP's are going to receive. So MSP's have voted for substantially *less* of a pay increase than they would have received otherwise. 

Funny how the Telegraph doesn't mention a word of that, isn't it? 

Edit: here's the BBC article. My numbers were a tad off, but my point still stands. The Telegraph has a very specific agenda, so I don't trust a word it says.

null,false,YodaTheCoder,UnionFlag,SV650,null,"I was a driver for 20 years, the first time I sat on a bike was on the CBT. When I got off the bike at the end I knew I wanted one. I couldn't afford the time or the up-front cost to do a 1 week course so I had to spread the lessons out, half-day at a time for about 8 weeks. So only 3.5-4 full-day lessons between CBT and passing Mod2. Broken down that was 1/2 day transition between 125 and 600. Half a day fully on the 600 on road. Two half day's doing Mod1 practice. Two more half days on road prepping for Mod2. Half a day lesson immediately before Mod2.

I'd say having been a driver was a big help, already having the road sense, being able to spot potential hazards, judging distance and speed etc meant all I had to concentrate on was how to work this new machine. The time in between lessons I spent reading about bikes, watching YouTube videos (RJ I love you!), researching gear, generally trying to pick up information from elsewhere that would be useful while learning.

/u/Ron-Dangerfield says below that he had a bad second lesson and the week break made it better. I found the opposite, if I had a bad day I had a whole week to dwell on it before I could get back on the bike to prove to myself it was just a blip. This will depend on your personality and learning style I suppose, so I'd say do what feels right for you (so no help here then :) )

The schemes your friends are talking about are most likely defined benefit schemes where your pension is based on your final salary; these are very expensive to fund as the money comes from a collective pot, whereas in a personal pension the money belongs to you. Most pension providers are very large companies and the chances of them going out of business are relatively small.

null,false,NEWSBOT3,null,null,null,"no - the things you have heard of are a type of pension that no longer exists - it used to be very common 30 or 40 years ago for a single company to run it's own pension scheme, but then they ran short of cash, dipped into the pension fund and went bust etc. It happened a lot in the 80s and 90s but I've never even met anyone with one now. 

Modern pensions are not run (except in a very very very small number of cases) by the company you work for , but are all done by pension management companies now.

saving money yourself exposes you to tax - pension contributions made give you the tax back on them.

ie, if i put in £1 from my salary as a 20% taxpayer, the government adds 20p on top. if i'm  40% taxpayer, they put in 40p etc. So it's the best form of savings account you can ever have, because it grows hugely the moment you put into it, plus any further gains from where it's invested.

There's also a few other common options companies offer

Matching is where the company adds to your pension for you.
So if they match up to 5% , you can put in 5% , get your tax back on it, and your company contribution too.

So if i put in £1, I  get my 20p from my tax, and £1 from my company. 
Now, saving £1 has gotten me £2.20 and that's before it's even been invested anywhere!


There's also an option called [Salary Sacrifice](http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/saving-into-a-pension/salary-sacrifice). pensions advice service explains this best;
&gt; As you're effectively earning a lower salary, both you and your employer pay lower National Insurance Contributions (NICs). Better still, your employer may pay part or all of their NIC saving to your pension too (although they don't have to do this).

ie, in a previous job it cost me £63 a month to contribute to my pension, but the amount going in was over £230 a month because of sacrifice, matching and tax back etc. 


**So what happens to your money ?**
lets say i have £5 of pension in a single company's shares. Over time, I know it'll increase (the *long* term trend for the stock market has always been up!) and if i'm lucky i'tll get 7% a year - so over 35 years it's become £27. 
But what happens if the company has a bad year and I dont get my 7% , or even worse goes bust entirely ?

Now of course that's quite a risk, so what investment companies do is they rate companies according to risk and reward. So you can invest your money in more risky investments with better chance of paying out. Or, you can keep it in a nice safe company that might only give 2% a year, but it'll deliver it every year consistently.

To further reduce this , my £5 is actually split across hundreds, maybe even thousands of companies, funds, debts (investing in govt debt is a pretty sold and consistent return etc.), so that while some might fail to perform well, overall the majority will and so i'll get an averagely decent return. I can adjust my risk/return at any time by speaking to my investment company. 

And that's what a typical modern pension is - it's about a very tax efficient savings method for the future. It has some risks , but a lot of potential benefits.

As for whether the European project has worked, that is still a matter of debate.

If its aim was to increase wealth by removing barriers to trade, that has also largely been a success. If its aim is to create a single European polity, then it has yet to triumph, and indeed the last European elections have cast considerable doubt on that goal, given the resurgence of radical left and right parties unhappy with more diktats from Brussels.

Secondly, yes they'll cope. I've taken a Van Van to Dubrovnik and that's a 12bhp 125. I did Dusseldorf to Birmingham in one day on it and it coped fine. The engine will cope and your fuel consumption will be good.

Having said that if you get an A2 licence I'd look at something a little bigger. Touring on a small bike is doable butit can be challenging, on a bigger bike it will eb a lot easier. For £2500 pounds you could get a restricted SV650 or ER6 that would be ideal or for less money you could get an older Honda CB500 or Kawasaki ER5 that would do the job. If you want something built for the job you could look at a Honda Deauville (AKA the Dullsville). It's not the most exciting bike but it's a small tourer with built in panniers and could be restricted to 47bhp. 

Is £2500 your whole budget? Bear in mind it can cost around £600-700 to pass the A2 test with all the training. Then you'll need gear which even with budget gear can easily be £500+. Then you'll need some sort of luggage, although you don't need a full set of panniers it's good to have a lockable top box at least. 

I wouldn't worry too much about mileage, unless it's ridiculously high, if the bikes have a good service history.

If you're near Derbyshire I can strongly recommend DART in Chesterfield, but you may have places closer to home that are just as good if you're elsewhere.

If you're going to have an A2, there are definitely bikes that will give you a more pleasant experience than the 250s. If that budget is your bike-buying budget (i.e. you've got separate money put aside for fuel, accommodation or camping or whatever etc etc) then you might want to look at something which can be restricted to A2 like an SV650, king of cheap-and-cheerful motorcycles. They're well known for being robust and long-lived, and they are fucking everywhere so I'm sure you can find a bargain if you look for it. The GS500 is a nastier option - where the SV is a cheap but good bike, the GS500 is a really cheap but shit bike. So there's that.

That said, if there's some particular reason you want the 250s, they'll certainly handle it. They've got enough power to hit 100mph if you really push them going downhill with a tailwind, I believe... And their tank ranges are surprising because they get pretty crazy MPG.

If you have a Defined Benefit pension scheme, since 2005 you've been protected by the Pension Protection Fund https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/pension-protection-fund http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_Protection_Fund

That was set up so that - even if your company did go bust - you wouldn't lose your pension.

Modern pensions (Defined Contribution) are a little different.  In essence, you and your employer pay into a savings account.  You (or your pension provider) then chooses how that money is invested.  You can choose a level of risk you are comfortable with - stick half of it in high risk, a quarter in medium risk, and the rest as cash.

If your employer goes bust, it doesn't matter - your pension fund is held by an entirely separate company.

You can move your pension between providers - or even hold it in multiple providers.

All pension companies are heavily regulated - see http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/pension-problems/making-a-complaint/jurisdiction and http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/ - so it is *extremely* unlikely that they could walk away with all your money.

The value of your pension may go down - if the investments perform poorly.

&gt;

&gt;The Board of the __Pension Protection Fund__ (the PPF) is a statutory fund in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) and the British counterpart of the American [Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_Benefit_Guaranty_Corporation). It was created under the [Pensions Act 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensions_Act_2004). The Board of the PPF is a [statutory corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_corporation) responsible for managing the Fund and for making payments to members. 

&gt;The PPF started on 6 April 2005 in response to public concern that when employers sponsoring defined benefit pension schemes became insolvent, scheme members could lose some or all of their pension if the scheme was underfunded. Besides offering compensation to those pension scheme members affected by insolvencies the Government hoped that the existence of the PPF would improve confidence in pension schemes generally.

&gt;The Board of the PPF has also taken over responsibility for managing the Fraud Compensation Fund, which will provide compensation to members of pension schemes who lose their entitlements due to Fraud. The PPF is chaired by [Lady Barbara Judge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara,_Lady_Judge).

If it is, the full paragraph actually says:

&gt;**I neither specifically looked for** nor found evidence of terrorism, radicalisation or violent extremism in the schools of concern in Birmingham.

A bit odd considering that was the point of the report?

He does go on to say:

*However, by reference to the definition of extremism in the Prevent strand of the Government’s counter terrorist strategy, CONTEST, and the spectrum of extremism described by the Prime Minister in his Munich speech in February 2011, I found clear evidence that there are a number of people, associated with each other and in positions of influence in schools and governing bodies, who espouse, endorse or fail to challenge extremist views.*

So maybe the plot was a load of rubbish, but there are people of influence in these schools who hold and endorse extremist views.

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. (See above for those figures)

~~Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured (they were measured once in Apr-Jun 2014 at 2% of employment or 1.0% of full time and 4.9% of part time), however~~ there is some regular measure of “underemployment”  by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures) 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and say they want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. Note that the Inactive category is only for 16-64 year olds. (See above for these figures)

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a margin of error, e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

Items highlighted with * or ** have more/less recent data available, so I have used these data instead, and used the same offset for the historic columns to maintain comparability.

In 1946, the economist Keynes negotiated a loan from the US to the UK to help rebuild the country following the WWII. If this hadn't had happened it is unlikely the UK would have been able to afford establishing the NHS or the welfare state. 

Additionally, it lead to a lot of Harold Wilson's unpopularity. He was unwilling to criticise the US' war in Vietnam although managed to keep us out of the war. When asked why he wouldn't criticise the war he said ""you do not kick your creditors in the balls.""
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_loan

&gt;2. The Falklands War

People seem to forget that prior to the Falklands War, Thatcher was considered to be one of the most unpopular leaders of all time. It is because of the quick and successful war that hearkened back to the 'good old days' of the Empire that she managed to win her second election.

&gt;3. Black Wednesday

This event is particularly important in a number of ways. The first is that Major managed to win the 1992 election based on the idea that the Conservatives were economically competent and Labour were not. This event completely shattered that idea and contributed towards the success of New Labour.

But also it has since been considered to have had a positive effect on the UK economy. The months and years following the event saw the economy grow tremendously as a result and helped fund public service spending under Blair.",null,0,null,1426672456,null,0,false,0,cpimjfp,null,t3_2zeuqr,null,t1_cpimjfp,null,t3_2zeuqr,null,null,null,1427826492,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Uncountable nouns tend to refer to more conceptual things which can't be enumerated. You don't use articles  or numbers with uncountable nouns.

Most nouns fall squarely into one camp or the other, but some can be used both ways, e.g. ""I'm to make myself a coffee"" but ""I'm going for coffee with Fred"" - both perfectly correct sentences, but the word coffee is being used for subtly different things.

&gt;  I found clear evidence
that there are a number of people, associated with each other and in
positions of influence in schools and governing bodies, who espouse,
sympathise with or fail to challenge extremist views. 


-
&gt; The existence of a common ideological stance among key linked
individuals in this enquiry, the taking of control of governing bodies and
the implementation of conservative religious practices in the schools
where these individuals have influence, means that there can be no
doubt that what has happened has been driven by a desire to instil a
particular style of religious ethos into these state non-faith schools. 

-
&gt;There has been co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action, carried
out by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant
and aggressive Islamic ethos into a few schools in Birmingham.  This
has been achieved in a number of schools through gaining influence on
the governing bodies, installing sympathetic headteachers or senior
members of staff, appointing like minded people to key positions, and
seeking to remove headteachers who they do not feel to be sufficiently
compliant with their agenda.

I have fought against my weight for about the last 5 years, and I'm now a healthy weight, but it has not been easy, it has taken considerable dedication.

I did it using an engineering approach - I would get up at the same time each morning, and weigh myself. Then I would record what I eat during the day. After doing this for a few weeks, I had a good record of days I was gaining and losing weight, and was able to spot trends. Essentially, days I was eating few carbs, I generally lost weight - so I decided to limit carbs. I didn't cut them out, I still ate them, I just changed the ratios around - less bread, smaller amounts of pasta or chips. Day by day I continued to monitor and slowly but surely the weight went down.

However, if I stop monitoring, I will gain that weight back so fast. About a year ago, I had a contract in another city so I was in a hotel for 2 weeks. I was having breakfast in the hotel, going out for lunch during the day, then either eating in the hotel or getting some takeaway or eating out in the evenings. I made sensible choices when I could, I had simple breakfasts, opted for lower calorie or lower carb lunches, and tried to eat sensibly in the evenings. I am an intelligent person who did not want to put weight back on, so I was careful. However, after the contract, I'd put on almost 2 stones.

I struggle, as an intelligent person, with a diligent approach to weight control. So for others who lack the same discipline, I am really not surprised they are struggling to win the battle with obesity.

null,false,iheke,null,null,null,"The analytics community have been speaking about the breakdown of our counterpress. This is the first wave of pressing led by Kane and includes the forward three (Townsend/Dembele/Eriksen/Chadli/Lamela - on occassion Paulinho). The so called 'poch press' has three phases. 

The first phase is the counterpress (which is extremely popular in the Bundesliga). Many tactical bloggers have pointed out that while Kane, Dembele and Eriksen (surprisingly) are pretty good at this phase, Chadli, Lamela and especially Townsend are not. The pressing is actually quite technical, it is not just about trying to make the tackle but also positioning yourself to block passing lanes. Basically the full back shouldn't be able to get the ball in behind the single attacker (mostly Dembele) into their number 4 or deeper lying center midfielder. The pass you're trying to make the opposition make is the pass up the line where they should be trapped by your fullback, the winger retreating with the pivot shuttling across with Dembele (again) blocking the passing lanes out.

This first phase has been failing on occasion because the attacking player has been too slow getting back leaving an easy pass inside which is exactly where you don't want the ball to go. Why is this bad?

Well, for two reasons. The first is what happens to the pivot. If the press is working well - one side of the pivot (say Mason) has moved across to squeeze the winger in. The other shuttles across to around the centre circle, if the winger succeeds in finding the space behind Dembele but in front of the second pivot. The attacking team has a 2 on 1 in the middle of the pitch with empty space over his shoulder. Between the two attacking centre mids their is then a high percentage chance of there being an easy pass. The attacker on the far side drifts in to seal the space - creating an easy 2 on 1 on the opposite side. This is open at every breakdown.

The second phase of the press is the movement by the pivots. Shuttling across and blocking passing lanes. They're not supposed to be all action but really thinking and technical. Their objective (mainly) is to delay the opposing team while we regain our shape. It is important that they don't commit themselves too much because once the opponent is beyond them they are straight on to the back four.

The second reason is because the third phase of the press which is the defensive line which plays high and aggressively seeks to intercept the ball. From this perspective it is straightforward why a breakdown in the middle is so problematic as runners breaking the lines have a free shot at the goal or cross into a dangerous area.

What's the solution?

Most of the an analytics/tactical guys say 'bench Townsend' - Lamela is more active on Defence and shuttles back better. This might help fix that first phase of press.

The second fix - and you won't like it - is upgrade Mason. He's great for now, but as a re-positioned attacking mid his instincts aren't right especially in the block press where its not about getting tight and making a tackle but ensuring that the angles are right so that the bad pass (for your team) isn't made.

For me, I can see why Poch went with Dier over Fazio - Dier is more mobile, has more legs and has that youthful eagerness to learn. Fazio was awesome in terms of attacking the high ball but was ridiculously slow for balls in behind and was only a par in takeons so with experience Dier might be a better prospect. Vertonghen on the other hand is a problem. He shows zero leadership. Rose, Walker and Dier are all under 25. As a defensive unit they need to be led but I simply cannot see Vertonghen doing it.",null,0,null,1426673635,null,0,false,0,cpimrob,null,t3_2z8hwq,null,t1_cpimrob,null,t3_2z8hwq,null,null,null,1427826600,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

Posters were found in the classrooms encouraging children to begin lessons with a Muslim prayer, one saying: “If you do not pray, you are worse than a kafir”, and staff reported that loudspeakers were set up in the school to broadcast a call to prayer. The few pupils that elected to study a Christianity unit as part of the Religious Studies GCSE course had to ""teach themselves"", because the teacher focussed on Islamic studies which the majority were studying.[51][52]

The Department for Education inspection found the seating arrangements “often with boys sitting towards the front of the class and girls at the back or around the sides”. The annual sports event for boys and girls was scheduled in different days.[53] Girls claimed to have been discriminated against and said some were sent home from a tennis tournament because their dress was too ""revealing"".[54]

Sweet! 

But at the same time it seems I'm paying so much less in tax than I did before 2010.. 

Tax paid in 09/10 = £5,826.80

Tax paid in 15/16 = £4,912.80

I'm giving over a grand less per year than I was (or would have been if I was earning what I earn now, then..) under the Tories.

I'm also completely unconvinced that it is required by banking regulation.  Why?  Because my bank didn't take copies of any of these same documents when I opened an account (they wanted to ""see"" an identity document, but they did not copy them).

I suspect this is just an interpretation of the regulations by these exchanges, and for some reason it's caught on and become de-facto.  This despite the fact that every bank transfer you make to or from the exchange comes with identifying information of the source account: hence when the government come knocking it will be perfectly reasonable to say ""the owner of account XXXXX at bank YYYYY is who you want"".

One day, one big exchange is going to be hacked not for bitcoins but for the high-resolution scans of hundreds of thousands of government-issued identity documents.  At that point it will turn out that these anti-money-laundering regulations have just aided identity theft, and hence large scale money laundering (since an excellent use of stolen identity documents is to open a bank account you can use for laundering money).  As is so often the case: the government action causes the very thing it purports to prevent.

&gt;George Osborne has promised to reimburse listed churches for the VAT his Budget imposed on building alterations, after the Church of England estimated the tax bill could come to £20m.
&gt;
Mr Osborne announced a 20 per cent tax on alteration work on listed buildings in last month’s Budget, a move ostensibly aimed at preventing the owners of listed mansions avoiding paying VAT if they added a swimming pool.
&gt;
The move was intended to remove what the Treasury believed was a “glaring anomaly”, where alterations to listed building were exempt from VAT, but repair and maintenance work was not.

Only happened since 2012. The government removed their VAT exemption, but is giving them funds to repair the building, on which they now have to pay VAT.

Before 2012 when Osborne did that, the Church received effectively no money for the maintenance of its vast array of listed, historical buildings. However, since they now have to pay VAT, they can't do it on their own any more.

I work in programming(.NET), we add value by applying our mind. My degree is in zoology, I honestly could have had a 3 year head start on what I'm doing now. There's nothing about the work I do that necessitates a degree and to be honest the rate the industry moves at I'd say vocational training would probably get us good workers faster than the degree route. When we say 'creative industries' what are we referring to? Personally I consider myself as working in technology, though I suppose it could be considered creative.

Industries add value by changing raw materials into a more valuable form. My dad works in a business which creates very finely calibrated lab equipment. Most of the guys there don't have a degree, that doesn't mean they're not highly skilled workers. It takes a lot of knowledge and experience to produce this equipment and the business is profitable. I see no good reason why we shouldn't encourage more like it. 

Overall what I'm trying to say is that selling insurance, banking and the like don't actually create much intrinsic value - even though they may be profitable.

Let's look at it logically. A lot of these surveys and polls, and generally a lot of the arguments you hear coming from the Green party amount to: ""People *would* vote for us if we had a different voting system... People would vote for us if they had a chance of winning... People would vote for us *if* Lab/Con weren't so well established. There's always a lot of ifs. 

The same goes for most of their policies. And there are many that aren't sensible. Short term, long term, whatever. Let me try and find you a post I wrote on their company policy statement a while back. But a lot of what they advocate and the issues they present are some of the most polarizing out there - they wind up dividing people into hard-line 'for' and 'against' camps. This will make it difficult for them to succeed internally, and also externally, given how partisan politics are at base nowadays anyway. 

You could say they are too radical for such an established economy to take such big risks on. Too radical to be useful. Now, idealism is important, but so is pragmatism. In my view it would make a lot more sense for those with an ecological or more socialist bent to infiltrate a larger party and influence them that way (climb the ranks or just use their clout as a faction of the membership). Either way, it's pretty clear that as this party grows (if it continues to) it will wind up having to moderate its views on most issues.

Penalties: We just haven't earned as many, when we're in the box we aren't as direct as before with Suarez. He always looked to attack players and go 1v1 forcing them to make a mistake.

Free kicks: Gerrard has taken fewer with less game time and Balotelli taking some as well. Also Free Kicks are tough to score from.

Corners: In general our corner taking has been awful, I would love to see a graphic of our corners that don't get past the first defender (especially from Coutinho). Even if there is a good ball delivered, we have only 1 player that attacks our corners properly and that's Skrtel. Everyone else will go for the header but Skrtel looks like the only player that will score from them. Not sure what that's down to, height maybe.

&gt;&gt;“This has absolutely driven a landmine under the [government’s] Big Society,” she said, arguing that Britain’s 12,500 listed churches were maintained with almost no public money and represented a good deal for the state.

This isn't what the National Trust is there for. These buildings are working places of worship. Do you think the National Trust could add over 12,000 buildings to its portfolio of currently about 200 buildings they maintain?

Are you suggesting we make it difficult for buildings to be maintained to a good standard? Or do you think we should remove all cathedrals and churches and let them struggle funding the repairs, after making them pay tax.

[It's not cheap maintaining building such as Westminster Abbey after all.](https://muinlondon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/westminster-abbey-1st-picture.jpg)

Why do you have such a problem with it? I doubt you'd care if it were for the maintenance of castles, or given to the National Trust, which you seem to say is fine due to the lack of religious context. The organisation means nothing.

It isn't if you focus solely on the central ""engine"" of energy balance.  It is if you consider the contributing factors on all sides, which one must do.

&gt;How lowly do you rate human competence that you think changing the entirety of the food economy is preferable to changing the portion sizes of individuals who are obese.

I'm a researcher into causes of obesity.  I don't rate human competency low, I rate our biological mechanisms preventing weight gain lowly.  We just aren't designed for this kind of environment, as evidenced by the large majority of the population being overweight or obese.  

I'm not advocating just altering the food economy, although that would certainly be a large part of it.  Crap food and drinks have never been cheaper, or more available, or quicker to eat, or more intensely marketed.  Similarly, it's never been easier to go a day without doing any significant physical exertion.

The goal of restrictions or incentives targeting these drivers IS to reduce portion size, or improve portion quality, or increase physical energy expenditure - the difference is you are ignoring the underlying causes and trying to patch the symptoms.  How well has that worked in the last decade?

&gt;You are basically equating fat people to cattle who are incapable of individual responsibility and planning.

Not at all.  I'm equating us to what we are - balls of complex chemical reactions.  Your appetite isn't determined by your ""individual responsibility"" - it's determined solely by biochemical signalling networks linking your metabolically sensitive organs and your brain.

Look how in the old one there are three leaves pointing downwards at similar points, two pointing out and down at the same angle and the general shape of all of the leaves together. Now look at the new one, the leaves on the left all start pointing upwards gradually, but on the right all point outwards at the same angle. It's form isn't symmetrical and clearly not much thought has gone into the aesthetics at all.

* The rose is in a completely different style to the other flowers and just looks like it doesn't belong here. Either they should all look more representative, or the rose should be drawn in a more ""realistic"" style.

My post was insinuating that at least with two parties to each side we could always pretend we are democratic. Instead of trying to move away from sectarian voting, we are moving to strengthen it. 

This year these two parties have put up one candidate to keep ""themmuns"" out. Bottom line. 

You have always had the option of voting tactically if you wished. This year people have had their choice cut because of the two parties decision. In the past, if they wanted to vote tactically they could, if they don't then they don't have to. What if the dup voters in fermanagh want to vote DUP?

Which bit are you getting that from?  The employment rate is at the highest every.  The unpaid workers is down from last quarter, and I feel it's very disingenuous to not use the 'rate' due to population growth.

As for the zero hour thing, the odd thing about that is, when surveying those people, it's often found that many, do not want more hours, those that do are not much different from those in contracted hours.  We will have more data about this, as the workforce surveys on this issue so far, are not really as good as ONS data, so hopefully we will get more of a picture over the coming year.  But for now, the wants more hours measure is quite meaningful.  I'd say that having fewer un-employed + wanting more hours, than we had just un-employed last election is a good direction to be heading in.

The one I found odd was the drop in weekly earnings, compared to a year ago.  However, if we actually bother to look at the ONS data, we see this is interesting, as it's been flat with a slight rise in the private sector, and a drop for the public sector.

However, thanks to circumstances completely outside of our control (oil prices) this drop look to be offset by the drop in inflation.",null,0,null,1426679523,null,0,false,0,cpio489,null,t3_2zg9wd,null,t1_cpio489,null,t1_cpinvw9,null,null,null,1427827779,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Of course not.  You're completely misconstruing my arguments or failing to understand them.  Most people vaguely appreciate the health impacts of obesity yet fail to do something about for any number of reasons.  I shouldn't have to describe them here, but the common underlying causes are laid out in the obesity systems map I linked above. 

&gt;Because the vast majority of people I know are subject to the exact same environmental pressures and yet are a healthy weight and value their health relatively highly.

If you want to cut government, you don't frame it as cutting government because voters don't want less police, less NHS, they want better services. 

However, the public love tax cuts. So you cut taxes and run a deficit, then it's no longer cutting services but rather, making hard choices. 

If you sincerely only cared about the deficit you would cut some services and raise some taxes. Right? By cutting both it shows the priority is reducing the size of government - not that this should be a surprise to anyone. Lots of people make the argument for smaller government.

Basic rate tax relief is normally given at source, meaning in the example of a £100 gross pension contribution, you pay £80 and the pension provider claims the £20 for you and adds it to your pension. 

If you are a higher or additional rate tax payer, you then claim back the higher rate relief through your tax return. The way this works is you pay £80, £20 extra gets added to your pension and you claim back another £20 or £25 (depending if you are higher or additional rate) from your tax return making the net contribution you effectively paid only £60 or £55 for a gross pension contribution of £100.

Remember though, you can only get tax relief on your contributions up to your relevant UK earnings or £40,000, whichever is the lower.

null,false,noo_runner,null,null,null,"Just to confirm - I was aware my reduction in carbs was essentially calorie restriction, and as an engineer, I firmly subscribed to the simple view that reducing calories would (and did) result in weight loss. You're right though, I just selected something I could live with on a daily basis, rather than some unsustainable model.

Something which I really struggled with however, was that the number of calories I needed to eat to lose weight was drastically lower than I was lead to believe using websites which can estimate it for you. It was routinely suggested that I needed to eat around 2200-2500 to lose weight, when in reality I've found that I actually required around 1600 to lose weight.

When you start realising how many calories are in certain products, making some small changes can have a dramatic difference. I used to think nothing of eating a whole frozen pizza (~800-1100 calories, depending on the precise product). I could easily eat that for lunch, and then have dinner later. Obviously, the issue is that the food itself is calorie dense, but not really particularly satisfying. 1 tin of chunky soup is around 250 calories - but I'm guessing most people won't sit down to eat 4 tins of that - and if they did, I doubt they would want dinner later. 
I'll still eat a whole pizza, but I know that basically, that's half my calories for the day. The almost mindless nature of eating I had before was the problem. But as I said before, even now, with the knowledge I have, it's a daily battle.

But I just don't see how Hazard in the middle will help us. He plays better when he can play one twos off the central player. If you put him in the middle he becomes the person people play one twos off of. The way we are set up is the wings cut in and makes run between the outside back and middle defender. It plays to Hazard and Willian strengths. I think Oscar plays his role in the middle well. We don't ask him to be on the ball a lot. He is more to move defenders and make complementary runs for the wingers. Fabregas is the guy we have on the ball. Sure I would love to see Hazard play in the middle a few games.

After Sunderlands sacking of Gus Poyet and the new appointment of Advoocat I figured the Sunderland boys would be in a mood to impress their new manager by playing offensive, which means we could counter!

Lineup:
                  Adrian
Jenko     Collins     Burke (Reece) Cresswell
            Kouyate Song
Jarvis                            Downing

Sunderland put pressure on us but we counter fantastic to almost score a goal! Sakho right at the keeper in the early stage of the match, Sunderland with a fantastic goal right before half time, the problem is that Defoe is 5 yards offside however the officials are high on mushrooms so they let the gold stand.

I think it can be summed up concisely: The cycle of abuse. A good example of this, given that you agree that FGM (taken in totality) is a terrible thing that shouldn't be done to an infant, child or anyone, is to consider the women who perpetuate the tradition around the world. Take any argument for Male GM and it's probably fair to say there is a direct or generally analogous argument made for FGM. I'm not being rhetorical: I mean that sincerely. I think there are still videos on YT from various documentaries where mothers speak about how wonderful the ceremony is, becoming a woman etc. when they're asked to justify putting their daughters through it.

A good starting point to consider for male cutting is: How many men would happily consider that their penis might be anything other than perfect and fully functioning?

Is it more likely a woman killed her herself because of the chance of being convicted for making up a rape allegation, or that she killed herself because she was raped and may be convicted for reporting it/not being believed?

I'm not a psychologist/statistician, but I would have thought the vast majority of cases would belong to the latter group. **edit: Then I read the fkin article - She had bipolar disorder. Maybe a factor too? I don't know.**

Something else to consider: there have been documented cases of women being pressured into dropping charges 'informally'. Then they have been charged with making false allegations. I recall reading about one in the US recently. I'll try to find a link if requested.

That's not to say that's the case here, of course. Or that it's not, for that matter.

However I think it's fair to ignore the cases of false allegation - in so far as removing them from the narrative (the media at large makes too much noise)  - for the moment given how often people are raped, how often they don't report it, or how often they are raped and report it and it doesn't go to court, or does and doesn't end in a conviction.

         Kouyate    Noble

               Downing

          Sakho      Nene


Bench: Adrian, Obrien, Cole, Amalfitano, Nolan, Jarvis, Poyet


Pre Match: Everybody here says how strong the lineup looks good, people are happy to see nene get his first start.  Debate rages over how his name is pronounced. 

3: Diego Poyet is on the bench in tears. Since his dad lost his job he can't buy his son the new fifa game. Diego was looking forward to saying hello to his dad on the sidelines and seeing him take photos of his son for the Christmas letter.

7:  CLOSE!!! Nene picks the ball from 20 yards and hits the upright. 
 
15: Jaasklainen is unhappy to be in goals because he is very cold. He misses his big jacket and being able to talk with all his friends on the bench. 

18:  Andy Carrol is in the stands talking to his father, it turns out it was actually Matt Jarvis eating a bowl of cereal. 

22: GOAL! After a good passing spell Song threads a pass to nene who slots it in easily from 10 yards. He celebrates by bashing an opposition fan. He later claims Enner Valencia said it was what West Ham does when they're happy.

35: Joey Obrien is drinking from a hip flask on the bench. He is so depressed being on the sidelines, he wants to play soooo bad. Why did big Sam have to bring in more players? I am just as good he thinks.  He jogs to the sideline to do some passing with Jarvis. His first pass he air swings and falls over. Jarvis goes back to eat more cereal.

42: Sunderland almost score after Song gets distracted trying to sell the referee his clothing line. They are only stopped after Jenkinson makes a sliding tackle at the last second. Every Arsenal fan on r/soccer starts calling for Jenkinson to win the Ballon d'or. At least they would if they ever watched him play.


Halftime 1-0.  Everybody on here agrees that we should keep going as is, yet the main question is how will we fuck up this week?  The commentators remark how well West Ham have been doing and how Nolan could be the danger man. It is obvious they havent seen the team play in years.


46: Big Sam, despite everything going well puts Nolan in for Kouyate and moves Downing to the right. Nolan looks puffed.  Commentators remark what a wise move this is.

48:  Nolan almost scores from a corner with a bicycle kick that is barely saved. Everybody immediately forgets this and calls him shit again.  Someone comments he looks gassed.

55: 1-1:  Sunderland score from a free kick after Collins tackles a guy heavily outside the box. Jaasklainen is unable to save the shot because he is too busy trying to ask Noble what he wants to do after the game.

61: CLOSE!! Sunderland force a good save form Jaasklainen. Jussi makes loads of unnecessary dives because Adrian said the trick to being awesome is to dive a lot more than necessary, 

68: Nene comes off for Cole. He points out to Allardyce as he comes off that his fifa stats are way higher than Cole's so he should stay on. Big Sam says he only plays PES.

75: GOOOAL: Cole scores from 15 yards after a Downing shot from outside the box hits the post and rebounds. All that long range shooting practice pays off for Cole.

85: Song comes off for Poyet.  Diego thinks he sees his dad in the crowd, it turns out to be Matt Jarvis eating a bowl of cereal.  

88: GOOOAL After an good build up, involving a Nolan nutmeg and rabona and a Sakho maradona, Cole scores a tap in. His fifa IF card goes for more than TOTY Messi.  

90+2: Jaasklainen makes repeated saves in the space of 5 minutes.  He still gets dropped next week for an Adrian who has 3 dislocated fingers and is blind in one eye.

Final score: 3-1. But what's this?? As the camera is about to pan out we see a lone figue in the tunnel. It's Gus Poyet!!!  He got to see his son play after all!!  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NARR0dsi72s&amp;t=298

As he walks away, we later find out he was there because he poisoned Big Sam's after game milkshakes. Gus Poyet take the West Ham job, leads the team to glory and makes his son the Captain.  The movie version of him is played by Ben stiller.  The End.

This would be very interesting to see. As I understand it, the main reasons women are pressured to drop cases are to keep crime figures low and because of the unlikelihood of obtaining a conviction - both of which would be moot if the decision was then made to prosecute the claimant for making a false allegation. 

&gt; However I think it's fair to ignore the cases of false allegation... for the moment given how often people are raped, how often they don't report it, or how often they are raped and report it and it doesn't go to court, or does and doesn't end in a conviction.

You couldn't say the idea of fairness was deeply ingrained in a country when sizeable proportions of people don't agree on what that means or how it should manifest. Or the notion of inclusion. Who is to say what a value shared by a country is? Delhi has an awful record in its treatment of women, but from a legal standpoint it is something they're trying to tackle, showing that there is strong support within the country against it.

Subjective. Government actually is trying to encourage more people from my demographic to vote. Popular opinion seems to be against you.

It was voter apathy with the Labour party over perceived poor handling of the 2008 economic crisis. Current support for the Tories is relatively high because Labour are seen to offer no credible alternative, have poor leadership and the Conservatives can claim they're doing a good job because they are the ones in power. Of course, this has nothing at all to do with the conversation above. 

The objective truth is that unemployment is relatively low in the UK compared to other EU member states and that immigration doesn't displace natives in the job market in times of economic growth.

No, we didn't. We have 290,000 NET. Most go home within the first year and most of which were from eastern Europe. People coming here, isn't the same as people coming to live here. Most who come don't even get accommodation, they either rent or live with somebody and then go, or a lot of them are students who stay in the residencies provided.

&gt; Just carry on if you want to destroy our 'free' NHS

What does this have to do with freedom of movement with Canada, UK, Aus and NZ? All of those nations have free universal healthcare, so there would be no health tourism like there is in some European countries. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_coverage_by_country#/media/File:Universal_health_care.svg

It isn't like Eastern Europe where people who don't have healthcare take advantage of freedom of movement to get on the NHS. Why would a Canadian leave Canada to use the NHS? They've got their own, equally capable and free healthcare system. If anything it would hep the NHS, because of instead of poorly skilled nurses from Europe and doctors coming to work in the NHS, it would be highly skilled commonwealth citizens. In fact the person who is running this campaign interviewed an Australian doctor who wanted to get citizenship to stay and work, but could not so had to leave.

&gt;  It might seem in your head like we'll all be holding hands as one, but the realities of overcrowding our tiny island are very different.

Yes, because Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders will be coming here in the hundreds of thousands from their terrible jobless, criminal run countries. (sarcasm). 

Also, tiny island, really? The UK is a lot bigger than people seem to think, Japan is about the same size and is double our population. The problem isn't we're small and running out of space 80% of the UK is greenland, it is that our cities are small and we only have a few major cities unlike most countries.

null,false,barejokez,null,null,null,"this is not comprehensive, but here's a few things to consider:

'1.  British people LOVE property.  There is nothing that gets people more excited than talking about property investment.  bear this in mind, because the views that people will present you with are not always as clear as you might be led to believe.

'2.  people will generally buy property using mostly bank debt.  they will get a mortgage from a bank for something like 75% of the house's cost/value (loan-to-value: LTV for short).  They will then pay the remaining 25% from their savings if it is their first home.  Usually, people will look to get the maximum amount of debt, although i personally think this is not a great strategy.  unfortunately, when prices are high it's hard to raise enough cash yourself, so bank debt at 80%+ LTV is tempting.  however, it means the interest cost will be more expensive, and refinancing may be harder (see 2.b)

'2. b) most people have a 25 year loan agreement with a bank, but they cancel and renew it every 2-3 years.  Banks encourage this by giving you a 3 year teaser interest rate, then reverting back to a higher rate.  you can form your own views on the bank's reasoning for this, but generally, the penalties for early exit after this point are low, and most people will refinance (sometimes with the same bank!) so that they take on a new mortgage and simultaneously pay back the old one.  This only works if you get your home revalued and the LTV you need is not too high.  In the past when house prices dropped, you could find yourself owing the bank more than the property is worth. no new bank will lend under these conditions and you are stuck at the high rate.  

'3. estate agents will sell you the house, but they work for the Vendor, not you.  they get paid x% of the sold price, so it is in their interest to get you to buy, and then to get the price as high as possible.  remember this.

'4. people will talk about exchange and completion.  The process is that you will see a house for sale at £400k.  you will offer the seller £390k and they will accept.  solicitors will go to work doing various checks (checking the house isn't over an ancient indian burial ground etc) before agreeing the exchange.  Exchange is when you formally lock in that price and agree that the property will change hands.  you sign a contract that basically says ""in 1 month's time, i will give you money, and you give me the house."".  You will exchange signed contracts (or rather the solicitors will), and also pay a % of the price as a deposit.  You need to insure the house at this point, as you still have to buy it if it burns down before completion.  completion is the day that the keys get handed over.  it is often one of the most stressful days of your life!

'5.  Often people will be buying and selling a property at the same time.  this means they will complete on two transactions on the same day, and move their belongings from one place to the other, and also see big amounts of money go in and out of their solicitor's bank accounts.  It also makes things complicated, as a hold up anywhere in the chain of transactions can cause the whole thing to fall apart.  Normally at one end of the chain will be a first time buyer (like you) and at the other end will be a dead person's family or a housebuilding company.

'6. british people talk about house size in terms of number of bedrooms and bathrooms.  most other countries prefer to measure a house in terms of how many square metres space it has inside (which i much prefer).  beware the 6 bedroom house that only measure 1,500 square feet...",null,0,null,1426685174,null,0,false,0,cpiq26u,null,t3_2zgeio,null,t1_cpiq26u,null,t3_2zgeio,null,null,null,1427828895,null,12,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,12,null

&gt; War says it is supporting several women who say they were forced into retracting their rape complaint by police and then told they would be prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.

So (if you don't mind!) rather than ferret looking for that one I read a while ago, I'll leave you with your own! That was the gist of the article I read too.

With regard the ""tip of the iceberg"" comment, from the Wiki entry I note this:

&gt; Harris and Grace (1999), Smith (1989), and others found that police decisions to no-crime were frequently dubious and based entirely on the officer's personal judgement. Rumney notes that some officers seem to ""have fixed views and expectations about how genuine rape victims should react to their victimization."" He adds that ""qualitative research also suggests that some officers continue to exhibit an unjustified scepticism of rape complainants, while others interpret such things as lack of evidence or complaint withdrawal as 'proof' of a false allegation.""

Of course that is the Police, however the CPS is not infallible.

And then this further on:

&gt; Rumney's second conclusion is that it is impossible to ""discern with any degree of certainty the actual rate of false allegations"" due to the fact that many of the studies of false allegations have adopted unreliable or untested research methodologies.

And your article again:

&gt; Recent figures from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, the police watchdog, revealed that more than a quarter of rape and sexual offences were not being recorded as crimes by forces and rape is a hugely under-reported offence.

I'm not sure that the point you were trying to make is justified. From your linked article:

&gt; In 2012/13 there were 3,692 prosecutions for rape in England and Wales, resulting in 2,333 convictions.

An [estimated 85,000 women](http://www.rapecrisis.org.uk/Statistics2.php) are raped each year in the UK. An example of reporting: from [June 13 to June 14 was 22,116](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29642455).

So 85,000 raped. 22,000 reported. 3,500 prosecuted. 2,300 convicted. Even if we allow for multiple rapes being committed by the same men, that's still a very small fraction of convictions compared to the number of crimes.

If we assume that rapists are prosecuted as the same rate as those who falsely allege rape, we've got 100 false rapes compared to, say, 2,500 actual rapes (allowing for multiple rapes from one rapist instead of 1to1). That's 1 in 25: 4%. Not insignificant, perhaps. However, given the nature of rape and the way society (in general) often views those who have been raped (""asking for it"") I think it's fair to say that we should go with a much higher number on the ""actual rapes"" side.

Hence my view that we should ignore false rapes from the media narrative. To put it bluntly: Far more people suffer from rape than suffer from ""false rape"". Even though I know my life would be ruined by a false allegation, I *hope* I would still recognise that fact and behave accordingly.",null,0,null,1426685561,null,0,1426685754,0,cpiq88s,null,t3_2zg7y2,null,t1_cpiq88s,null,t1_cpippa2,null,null,null,1427828974,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I've got a couple of theories for this...

1. The 'floater' footballs. Corners are normally curled using the instep. This means that they aren't hit as hard, and these balls are so light that they don't have the trajectory/speed/power/direction that corners used to have, making them easier for keepers to claim (notice how high corners go as well.

2. The dip on the edge of pitches. It means the run-up for players is quite difficult, running upwards and hitting the ball cleanly and going from one type of surface to another makes it much more difficult to strike a ball cleanly. Its like running on concrete and then grass in studs. It's really hard.

These are both fairly recent things across the league and I believe contribute to the general downward trend in the quality of corners.

I really think that everybody has had a fair share of cuts, and a few perks for most too.

The pension age was bumped up quite a bit. Wealthier people get hit with this huge extra liability in their pensions. Changes to stamp duty too affected older, wealthier people. And that controversial 45% income tax bracket is still higher than it was for all of Labour.

For the young working people, there's help to buy, huge reductions in stamp duty for first time buyers (some of my friends saving £1000-£3000), big increases in tax free allowance too.

For people in the middle, the 40% bracket just got bumped up a little bit.

I was really hoping for something more than merely claims, but I've lost sources many-a-time before so won't begrudge you if you aren't able to ferret it out.

&gt; I'm not sure that the point you were trying to make is justified... An estimated 85,000 women are raped each year in the UK. An example of reporting: from June 13 to June 14 was 22,116... So 85,000 raped. 22,000 reported. 3,500 prosecuted. 2,300 convicted. Even if we allow for multiple rapes being committed by the same men, that's still a very small fraction of convictions compared to the number of crimes... If we assume that rapists are prosecuted as the same rate as those who falsely allege rape, we've got 100 false rapes compared to, say, 2,500 actual rapes (allowing for multiple rapes from one rapist instead of 1to1). That's 1 in 25: 4%. 

That's 1 in 25 that are provable in a court of law. That doesn't take account of ""he said, she said"" scenarios, Ched-Evans-type miscarriages, etc. And that is without even getting into actual wrongful convictions on rape (which thanks to DNA testing are fewer and farther between, but we're still seeing people exonerated decades after being jailed).

&gt; Not insignificant, perhaps. However, given the nature of rape and the way society (in general) often views those who have been raped (""asking for it"") I think it's fair to say that we should go with a much higher number on the ""actual rapes"" side... Hence my view that we should ignore false rapes from the media narrative. To put it bluntly: Far more people suffer from rape than suffer from ""false rape"". Even though I know my life would be ruined by a false allegation, I hope I would still recognise that fact and behave accordingly.

Taking into account the increasingly broad definition of rape (to the point where it refers to drunken sex she regrets) and the increasingly severe consequences of being labelled a rapist (even without conviction people have been attacked by vigilantes), I'd have to disagree with your conclusion but I respect the effort you've made to support it and to engage constructively.",null,0,null,1426686331,null,0,false,0,cpiqkmq,null,t3_2zg7y2,null,t1_cpiqkmq,null,t1_cpiq88s,null,null,null,1427829218,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

They ignore him, and are busy creating a stretcher, and while they are distracted the Doctor finds a nice sized rock and starts to raise it up like he is going to smash the cave mans head in!

I find that underneath it all most people have similar motivations but their outlook and values can be very different to British values. I think it is easier to define British values in relation to other cultures than define our values out of context.

We value independence from the family unit more than Italians with most people moving out of home a lot earlier and not being as close with the rest of the family. In Italy it is common to live with parents into the 30;s.

In America I found people friendlier and more receptive to conversation in public with strangers. We are much more open than the Finns though, who have been described as a nation of introverts.

We are much less patriotic than the Americans and we are more suspicious of the motivations of overly patriotic people. 

We value fair play and are known for our love of queuing. I remember being in a shop in Hangzhou where I was ushered to the front of a que to be served in front of all the native Chinese because I am white. I couldn't accept that as it felt rude whereas for reasons I still don't quite understand they felt it was necessary. We are much more polite than the Chinese and many of our idiosyncrasies of what makes up our relations in public just do not apply in China. 

It is hard to quantify because the differences in values permeate every aspect of life in the UK. I think a good example of differing values is of South American footballers who struggle to adapt to British values, whereas northern Europeans have a much better time. 

Do you really not think we don't have British values that can be quantified?

* new accounts will be available for 4 years, but once you have opened an account there’s no limit on how you long you can save for

* accounts will be available through banks and building societies from Autumn 2015

* you can make an initial deposit of £1,000 when you open the account – in addition to normal monthly savings (looks like you can't move in a lump sum already saved then)

* there is no minimum monthly deposit – but you can save up to £200 a month

* accounts are limited to one per person rather than one per home – so those buying together can both receive a bonus

* only available to individuals who are 16 and over

* the bonus is available to first time buyers purchasing UK properties

* minimum bonus size of £400 per person

* maximum bonus size of £3,000 per person ~~(hopefully this is per year, but I fear not)~~ (just did the maths, it isn't possible to save the maximum in a single year)

* the bonus will be available on home purchases of up to £450,000 in London and up to £250,000 outside London

* the bonus will be paid when you buy your first home

i.e. If you save £12,000, the government bonus will boost your total savings to £15,000",null,0,null,1426688110,null,0,1426688313,0,cpirf7p,null,t3_2zgson,null,t1_cpirf7p,null,t1_cpiqxf9,null,null,null,1427830003,null,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5,null

Look for words like, 'fast healing' on plasters, or blister packs, they're usually hydrocolloids. Check that they are first though and you'll have to cut them up to fit. 

It's really hard to find acne patches in the UK, no-one seems to want to do them. Some cold sore ones are, but not all are. My favourite brand are Dotz, they do three types of hydrocolloids:

* [Acne](http://i.imgur.com/na0St5Z.jpg) - pre cut in multiple sizes
* [Blister Plaster](http://i.imgur.com/I6NTJlW.jpg?1) - Two large sizes you have to cut yourself, thicker than the acne patches
* [Cold Sore Patches](http://i.imgur.com/qua2gxr.jpg) - 7 pre cut hydrocolloids thinner than the blister plasters, slightly thicker than acne &amp;amp; 7 thin plasters that are also useful to stop touching. They're also really really thin so you can wear them all day with no-one seeing.

I buy them in Poundland/99p Shop when I see them, but I saw the cold sore patches in Savers, and you can buy them on eBay/Amazon.

Nexcare Patches are an Asian acne patch that are also good. I bought some off eBay but you can apparently find them in the 99p shop at times.

Like I say, you are the problem.  Most of the voters in this country are motivated by who they *don't* want in rather than who they actually *do*.  This is retarded.  It allows parties to brush over actual progressive policy and rather pander to the old hat sectarian ""us and them"" mentality.

The sooner people stop saying ""anyone but them"" and actually hold their representatives to some form of conviction, the better.

Edit: and for the record, I don't vote Sinn Fein either, but I will never be in favour of a line of thinking that says ""I don't care how bad the policies and decisions are, as long as it isn't him making them.""

Most of the people I went to school with came from similar backgrounds. Some lived more comfortably, some less so, but for the most part our origins are comparable. I appreciate that I was lucky enough to have the ability to go to university and try and make a career for myself (still poor though, as I am a student. My annual income would be greater at the moment if I had gone into unskilled work). The less bright ones who went on to make something of themselves learned trades, or tried to stick at the academic route and worked hard at it. If you want to get off the minimum wage, that is the kind of thing you *have* to do. 

The comment above suggested that people living on the minimum wage was a consequence of immigrants undercutting wages, but that argument is untrue and detracts from the reality that minimum wage workers are paid less because their jobs don't require a lot of skill. If native British people don't want to be on the minimum wage, their choice is to put up with it (and blame immigration) or make themselves more valuable. 

I know this conversation probably wouldn't suggest so, but I'm very left leaning. I support the welfare state and think more needs to be done to encourage social mobility, and think that the more well off people in society who can pay for it should be taxed to provide that. We can raise the minimum wage to make the lives of the lowly-paid more comfortable, but the truth is that if low skilled workers want to earn more, then getting skills is the way to do that. The moaning coming from people saying immigrants are undercutting wages, I believe, stems from a sense of entitlement; they believe they should be paid more than their labour is worth. Instead of blaming foreign people, they should perhaps try and increase the value of their labour. For the genuinely impoverished, I know retraining schemes are made available to those seeking employment.

By documented I meant where someone has gone to court to attest the fact. Twas an article iirc, but was reporting that the case (state being sued) is on-going.

&gt; Ched-Evans-type miscarriages

You think that was a miscarriage of justice and Evans was innocent? Edit: Hang on - so in that case the court was wrong, but in these false allegation convictions the court is right? Delved into the evidence on those ones much? Had a good look at all the facts and cross examinations? Or is Evans a special case?

&gt; even without conviction people have been attacked by vigilantes

That has nothing to do with how alleged victims should be treated by the police, the CPS or the legal system in general. To coin a phrase: We shouldn't be catering to the fuckwits. e.g. Just because idiots attack paediatrics isn't a case to relabel doctors who specialise in looking after kids.

&gt;  I respect the effort you've made to support it and to engage constructively.

That's because when I posted my comment, you hadn't revealed certain opinions like this:

&gt; Taking into account the increasingly broad definition of rape (to the point where it refers to drunken sex she regrets) 

So far as I know the definition is, and has been for a very long time along the lines of: ""intentional penetration with penis... without (or without belief of) consent."" Personally I think it should be expanded to include women being rapists, but that's by the by. And in any case that's not the issue here:

Have you taken the time to look into rape cases and see how often it's *not* ""regret sex"", how often it's done by someone known to the victim, how often it's a partner or similar etc.? Given how, as I mentioned earlier I think, how society looks at rape victims in general - this ""Oh you just regret it"" crap has been around for decades - do you really think a woman would think: 

""Oh I wish I hadn't had sex with that guy. All my friends are taking the piss. OK I'll have to pretend he raped me so that no-one thinks I'm slag. That way only tens of people will find out about it minimum: all the police and lawyers and that. And there's never any local and national interest about things like this so noway thousands of millions will know. And no rape victims, even when the rapist has been found guilty, have ever been forced out of their homes and got deaths threats because of it. No, this plan is perfect.""

Even if there are such morons around, and they do that, then it's a vanishingly small minority and, along with other false cases that are next to none in number compared to even reported rapes, should not be as big a part of the narrative as it is. Hence my original point again.

To conclude: The only reason I would engage any more is to try and make you understand how screwed up your apparent position is.

That wouldn't happen. Not in our current tax system.

Let's say I earn £100 and you earn £200. My tax band means I pay 20%, so I take home £80. Your tax band means you pay 50%, so you take home £100. You've still got more than me. That assumes no nuance, of course. Our tax system does have nuance, however. Such that:

I earn £100. I don't pay tax on the first £20, and then I pay 20% on the remaining £80. I pay £16 tax and keep £84.

You earn £200. You pay 20% tax on the first £120, then 40% on the remaining £80. You pay £24+£32, totalling £56 tax, so you keep £144.

Bob earns double what you earn - £400. He pays 20% on the first £120, 40% on the next £200, and 50% on the last £80. He pays £24+£80+£40=£144 tax, and he keeps £256. He earns double what you earn, and takes home still more than your pre-tax income.

If the upper tax bracket was 60%, Bob would pay £152 tax and take home £248.

Or are you refering to people who earn considerably above the upper tax bracket. Let's say Joy earns £800. She pays 20% on the first £120, 40% on the next £200, and 60% on the remaining £480. That's £24+£80+£288 for £392 tax, and takes home £408. Which is still more than Bob's pre-tax income, and some £160 more than his post-tax income.

In this scenario, with a 60% upper tax rate, I worked it out on a spreadsheet, there is no point at which someone earning twice as much as someone else would be taking home less than them. Someone could be earning £1.6m, and they'd still be taking home a lot more than someone earning £800k.",null,0,null,1426692915,null,0,false,0,cpiu45v,null,t3_2zg8ae,null,t1_cpiu45v,null,t1_cpipscw,null,null,null,1427833828,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

I don't see how Fazio stops the first goal. Carrick slides the ball between Dier and Walker and Fellaini runs away from Dier to score.

The first goal is also a great example of Townsend's poor defensive discipline and Mason's poor positioning. Young is standing on the touchline. Fellaini comes in and occupies a position in between Dier and Walker. At the halfway line Blind has run past Townsend and offers an outlet to Carrick and Mason is shadowing Carrick. At the point of the pass. Utd have engineered a 3 on 1 against Walker. Before the pass is made Walker looks inside at Felaini and to the outside at Young - he is also glancing up at Blind who looks to be preparing to charge past Young. Online, he was getting slaughtered, but he received no help. Mason should have been further across (tighter to Carrick) and standing in the passing lane to Fellaini. Townsend should be ensuring that Blind is covered which should allow Walker to sink a bit to stop Young from running off him and to provide room for him to intervene if a more difficult chipped pass comes into Fellaini. None of this happens and they score. Neville blames Walker and Dier on MNF but I expect Poch probably spoke with Townsend about how it is essential he gets back and Mason about where he should stand if an overload is developing.

On the second goal I see your point. Fazio attacks the high ball far better than anyone else so maybe the first ball - Dier vs Fellaini (which is a mismatch) doesn't happen.

On the third goal - he either makes the tackle on Rooney outside the box or fouls him (Fazio is v.professional in that sense). My critique of that situ is that noone made the decision to take the ball and man outside the box. The number of players surrounding Rooney more or less guarantees that the worse that might happen is a yellow card - there is no 'clear goal scoring chance' so in the melee the best approach was to stop play by hook or by crook. But they are young players seeking to play fair so you can't get too angry about that.",null,0,null,1426693457,null,0,false,0,cpiufxw,null,t3_2z8hwq,null,t1_cpiufxw,null,t1_cpiqv29,null,null,null,1427834171,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

Fat, sweet stuff tastes good (to a greater or lesser degree) to everyone on the planet. Are global obesity rates uniform? Of course not.  Are global obesity rates uniform by availability of fat/sweet things? More closely, yes. 

&gt;If you just point out to people that they're fat because they drink a 2 litre bottle of coke and eat a pack of digestives as a mid-meal snack each day and that it's not because they were ugly at school or can't find a job, then you can drive them to nip the actual cause in the bud: having a calorie surplus.

Everyone is aware, to some extent, of the consequences of overeating, and yet they do it anyway, consciously or not.  It's why diets don't work and it's why obesity and overweight affects the majority of the population.  You can stick your head in the sand and cry personal responsibility, but it won't change the fact that as a species we are dramatically biochemically prone to obesity and attempting to alter millions of years of evolved calorific thriftiness by simply asking people to eat less is doomed to failure.  

&gt;Oh, unless that is, you're trying to make a career out of talking about obesity.

My opinions and scientific ideas are the same as global public health bodies.  See [WHO](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/) for instance.  Or [Public Health England](http://www.noo.org.uk/NOO_about_obesity/causes) who link the excellent obesity systems map I linked earlier.  Or the [MRC](http://www.mrc.ac.uk/research/initiatives/obesity-research/obesity-research-background/), who despite being largely involved in clinical research also state in their research overview: 
&gt;Of particular importance are those contributing to the ‘obesogenic environment’, including changes in diet and eating habits leading to increased energy intake, and lifestyle factors increasing sedentary behaviour and thus reducing energy expenditure. These factors often vary in nature and effect size between social groups: for example, different age groups or economic/social class.

Or perhaps Harvard School of Public Health, who have a [nice, easy to follow guide to obesity prevention strategies](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-prevention/). 

To quote them directly:

&gt;To realize real strides, though, positive change must come to all parts of society: from governments and schools, businesses and non-profit organization, neighborhoods and communities, individuals and families. We need to change policies and create an environment where the default option is the healthy choice.

You may not consider the factors I've described important or relevant to the discussion of obesity, but I'm afraid that is wholly at odds with the scientific consensus.

What if it wasn't just that bakery that had a problem with you being an atheist. What if your pharmacist too, and your local superstore has some people from school you recognise and you think they told the other staff because they all mutter about you when they think you can't hear (or when they know you can).

 Your local atheist book store regularly gets it's windows broken and that's a shame because that was one of the few places you could go and talk to other people who understood what it was like being an atheist. 

Would your thoughts on the bakery be different if all this was true?

The world I described is purely a hypothetical one but it's not that different at all to this one not long ago. 


The anti-discrimination laws protect those people’s ability to live their lives like everyone else.  The laws protect our right to get jobs and to find housing or cakes. The laws also protect our dignity. Such laws specify and affirm that members of these groups are just as good as anyone else.

These laws are important for our whole society.  Without these laws, we are more likely to discriminate against certain groups.

null,false,frostreaver86,null,null,null,"Hey, thanks for doing the study! I'm just wondering what makes the study so bad? I'm open to learning to improve, and pass on to the 2nd years doing this.

On sample size, we use G*Power to estimate sample size needed to obtain a possible effect of Cohens d=0.5, at a power of .95 (well actually we are using odds ratio of prop1=0.5 and prop2= 0.7). We also base the sample estimate on previous papers, of which 300 is the higher end (excluding some studies on Google Forms which are in the 0,000s).

On sample make-up. Obviously the sample is not representative of the general population; we're restricting it to UK people (because we ran a pilot, discussed below) and know that Reddit and the social network of the students are primarily 17-40 somethings (mostly 18-28 lets be honest), white etc. 

The study theory relies on utility trade-of among alternatives. We used a pilot study to generate two attributes that were of approximately equal importance (equal weighting of attribute utility) to include in a main study. The pilot study was mostly 18-24 year olds, in education, in the UK. Thus for the pilot to have much relevance, we attempted to sample a population that roughly matched that (college students, UK Redditors).

The sampling is, however, random, if opportunistic. Its not easy to force the sample population as the pilot into doing the main study; some studies require undergraduates to complete it as part of a course credit to ensure some consistency in the sample, but we don't have this luxury. Even if we did, it'd suffer from the same general problem as not being representative of the general populations.

These are obvious considerations when writing up results; but the phenomena that are being examined (described in the debrief at the end) are shown to be relatively ubiquitous across cultures, ages, ethnicity and income brackets. Which at least makes it a bit less of a worry when discussing the results.

If given the opportunity (and some cash) we'd obtain a large population sample for a pilot study that aims to be representative of the general population, and do the same for the main. While the people would be randomly selected, we'd have to ensure some consistency in make-up. I'm looking into Google Forms :)

null,false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt; By documented I meant where someone has gone to court to attest the fact. Twas an article iirc, but was reporting that the case (state being sued) is on-going.

That sounds like exactly the sort of thing I'd be after so if you do find it please do post it.

&gt; You think that was a miscarriage of justice and Evans was innocent?

What I meant was the type of cases where the woman gives informed consent and there is no mens rea on the part of the ""rapist"" but the ""victim"" cannot remember giving informed consent due to the effects of alcohol. But as an aside, yes, I think the Evans conviction is unsafe.

&gt; So far as I know the definition is, and has been for a very long time along the lines of: ""intentional penetration with penis... without (or without belief of) consent.""

Yet this clearly isn't the definition used in the Ched Evans case, for example, where the ""victim"" gave explicit consent and Evans had no reason to believe the consent was not informed, being that at the time she was sufficiently informed to be having consensual sex with another party.

&gt; Have you taken the time to look into rape cases and see how often it's not ""regret sex""

Of course, but those are not usually the contentious cases. 

&gt; Given how, as I mentioned earlier I think, how society looks at rape victims in general - this ""Oh you just regret it"" crap has been around for decades - do you really think a woman would think:

&gt; ""Oh I wish I hadn't had sex with that guy. All my friends are taking the piss. OK I'll have to pretend he raped me so that no-one thinks I'm slag. That way only tens of people will find out about it minimum: all the police and lawyers and that. And there's never any local and national interest about things like this so noway thousands of millions will know. And no rape victims, even when the rapist has been found guilty, have ever been forced out of their homes and got deaths threats because of it. No, this plan is perfect.""

Absolutely some women think it is better to be thought a victim than a slut, more than 100 confirmed so far this decade by the courts, which requires a pretty impressive burden of proof. If the unreported rape figures are anything to go by then there are probably thousands to tens of thousands of further cases that don't result in prosecution. Not a vanishingly small minority at all.

Also, your premise for this argument seems to be that rape victims are treated worse than sluts by society when this is not the case. Victims receive special status, support, dispensation and compensation whereas sluts are viciously shamed, mocked, humiliated and spurned. With the odds of actually getting convicted of a false claim so slim, you'd almost have to be a moron not to try it on if you got caught out having sex with somebody you shouldn't have.

&gt; The only reason I would engage any more is to try and make you understand how screwed up your apparent position is.

Unfortunately my position has been carefully informed over decades of research in this area so unless the facts were to change, my position won't either. However, if you feel that any particular elements of my position are incorrect, I'd be happy to reflect on your criticisms and refute them if I am able.

null,false,DiscoPopShop,null,null,null,"I didn't say not rating Balo is irrational. /u/Helpopotamus' comments were irrational. Labelling people as apologists or haters is counter productive because if you think I'm an apologist you're not going to be objective about what I say. Then again discussion around Balo never tends to be objective.

I'll break down why I think they're irrational below, but that's it. I honestly can't be bothered arguing about Balotelli anymore. 

1) He called winning the free kick with some nice skill a menial task, I said it wasn't just winning the free kick but also how he did it with some lovely skill, and that if it was a player like Coutinho it wouldn't have been swept under the rug like he's doing with Balo. What he then does is zoom out and say well he doesn't do it consistently, whereas Coutinho does. But that's not relevant to that isolated incident that I'm saying he isn't getting credit for by certain people. Its like saying he shouldn't get credit for his goal against Bologna because he doesn't do it consistently enough, whereas someone like Suarez does. Its got nothing to do with the actual thing that happened that I am talking about. He discusses claims I've never made, which he assumes I back because he sees me as a Balo apologist, with 'it isn't enough to make them out to be good enough for a start', even though I never said he should be considered for a start, much less did I say he should be because of the Lallana goal. Irrationally bringing up an argument I didn't make, whilst not actually addressing the point I was making that Balo doesn't always get credit from doing good things (actually he reinforced it), especially from people like himself who seem to only be interested in slagging him off and discrediting him.

2) The point of my comparison with Henderson was that you shouldn't write off players because they have bad starts. 
&gt;'One being a model professional who is a massive team player who works EXTREMELY hard to improve himself, is really well behaved off and on it, is a leader and will literally give it all to try to help the team.'

This tangent I find especially ridiculous. Balo has been professional since joining Liverpool. What has he done to be unprofessional? The instagram incident? Naive but harmless, and I think everyone agrees the FA punishment was ridiculous. What else has he done? He says Henderson has been working 'EXTREMELY hard' to improve himself but then how can you say Balo hasn't? Lallana, Studge, Rodgers have all said Balotelli is working extremely hard on the training pitch since the turn of the year, and he has noticeably been better on the pitch with the impact he made in February. 

Aside from that, the argument is silly. You can equally put adjective to Balo and say they're reasons why he should be given a chance. 'He's skilled, strong, holds the ball up, links the play really well'. Its far too subjective to be a counter point.

3) 
&gt;What media fuss???? HAHAHA. Every other fucking day there's another news story about Balotelli. He attracts stupid amounts of attention despite not doing anything, it's redundant and ridiculously annoying.

What's he done to incite those? He has done a lot of ridiculous stuff in the past we all know that but I bring it back to this: what's he done to attract media attention since coming back to Liverpool? He hasn't lit any fireworks, got any red cards, even got in trouble. So bringing that up to say he's causing a fuss in the media when he's not actually done anything beside the instagram post that was blown out of proportion, is irrational.

There's so much irrationality when certain people attack Balotelli. Yes there are a lot of things that can be said about him negatively that make perfect sense, rational criticisms but so many on /r/liverpoolfc are just obsessed with pretending like he's never done any good for the team. And then they call the other side deluded and laugh at them, as if they're idiots, watching something else. It's all rather silly if I'm honest and I'd rather not be a part of it anymore.

I only point that out to show it is a very progressive formation.

He's certainly a cut above our other defenders at the minute - Sakho is a good player in the air and most of the time when tackling but his nervousness on the ball lets him down and while Can has had some great games, he has also shown his defensive frailties at times (not necessarily his fault as a midfielder playing in defence though).

null,false,strifeblood,null,null,null,"When he's off form, he concedes goals. People just tend to ignore the overall picture when he scores a goal back. Oddly enough, his defense has been the question mark for me this season, unlike last season. Often you'll see Ivanovic bomb up the pitch and when we lose possession, he simply won't have the pace to even get back in the picture often letting teams counter against just Terry, Cahill/Zouma and Dave. I think the biggest reason for Cahill's drop off this season is he's been a lot more exposed this year. Also, he hasn't been very good recently in set pieces. Two recent examples that come to mind are the Davld Luiz PSG header and Aston Villa game where he conceded a goal but scored a pretty nice goal. 

I still think he's one of the best, but even so we'd be better with Luis and Dave. Luis offers even more offensive ability than Ivanovic, great linkup play with Hazard, a free kick threat other than Oscar and has the ability to get back for counters. It would also allow Dave to play on the right where he's even better because it's his natural position and he can whip in crosses from the right much more effectively.

Seriously though you'd be surprised. There are plenty of secterian twats in the catholic community. Just as many as there are in the Protestant one. But some catholics or nationalists on here seem to like to believe they're better than unionists or above them. They seem to look down on us and think we're neanderthals. 

And really? Massive hate pyre... that isn't the purpose of a bonfire. The entire thing about King Billy in general really isn't what the twelfth is about. The bonfires are simply a good night out. A community gathering. When we had one where I live I'd see the entire neighborhood there and it was a great night, good atmosphere, seeing all your mates and for the majority of people having a few drinks (or slightly more than a few). There are people that obviously do think of the sectarian element or else there wouldn't be flegs on the bonfire. But the people that are coming to watch can't just remove the flags from it. They'd get decked by the sectarian ones. And sure people cheer when the tricolour starts to burn, but if you look around and look at the people in the crowd youll see VERY few cheering compared to what it seems like. Catholics or nationalists whichever you choose to define yourself as are very quick to look down on bonfires and the twelfth and call them out for being hate fests.

Some negatives to mention, The suspension is woefully bad, it bounces around (for me its part of the charm), and it is prone to rust if not kept clean (cosmetic not a mechanical issue), The 3-speed semi automatic gearbox is quite crunchy but you quickly get used to that. Also, especially as a new rider without a grasp of defensive riding fast A-roads and motorways are pretty grim and to be avoided where possible. Perfect for the town/city commute, shopping etc. Also parts are not as commonly held by smaller bike shops as most riders have moved onto more modern scooters/innovas (Although still very much available online/ebay etc)

I'm not sure how much i would have appreciated it as a first bike, but having ridden for 9 years now on all sorts of bikes its charm is clear to me, If you want something ""no frills"" that will just run and don't care about looks or performance it is the best selling bike in the world for a reason.

Greens want to remove the tax free allowance but give everyone £72 per week (that's worth £3744) (meaning more taxes for wealthy people and high earners).",null,0,null,1426702110,null,0,1426703351,0,cpizwyt,null,t3_2zg8ae,null,t1_cpizwyt,null,t1_cpin4fa,null,null,null,1427838755,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Marko Vejinovic from Vitesse has better stats this year, only few years older, and would be significantly cheaper if we indeed need a new midfielder.

Pogba's just a cool name to have in your team, I don't think the majority of people have even seen him play once. Youtube highlights could make any half-decent player look amazing.

For example, want to TRIPLE your employees? [lets say you are a business that deals with basic administration]. That'd be really expensive wouldn't it? Actually no. You just put them all on apprenticeships @ 2 quid something an hour. Suddenly you have triple the number of staff, doing more hours than before for a fraction of the price.

The joke about the apprenticeship scandal is that all government parties support it.

Slave labour in the UK isn't a new thing. The youth get exploited more so than anything out of all this. The real question is why is this the case? I personally think its to do with the amount of young people who do not vote and thus their opinions do not get counted (so you end up with slave labour apprenticeships).

But you are.  They are one and the same.  Impacts of personal environment are nested within global drivers.

&gt;People get fat because fatty sugary stuff tastes great and they can afford to eat and drink it and they can still live their lives as well as they want to live them. It's only when they can't live their lives as they want to live them that they will stop doing those bad things.

All fair, and precisely the issue.  

&gt;Unless, that is, they are educated about the issue and make a conscious effort to stop it. Which is what I'm talking about.

Your argument is effectively:

1) Obesity is solveable by personal education.
2) External drivers of obesity do not present themselves at an individual level.

Regarding 1), I'd love obesity to be solvable purely by education.  Unfortunately, it's the cheap skate, sounds-great-but-doesn't-work answer. The majority of individuals on intensive lifestyle modification do not maintain weightloss, because the external and internal pressures are simply too great.

Assuming: (round numbers to make things simpler)

* Lifetime allowance: £1M
* Inflation: 3%
* No tax free cash taken (just to make it simpler)
* No other changes to the current pension setup with regards to allowances / tax / etc.

In the first year, I 'withdraw' £50,000, I pay income tax on this and I have £950,000 of my allowance remaining.

The next year, the lifetime limit increases by inflation, to £1,030,000. My remaining allowance is £980,000.

Therefore, although the limit is £1M when I retire, I may not hit the limit until I've withdrawn more than that since I'm chasing the inflation linked value. Once I hit it, I'd be paying 55% tax on any further money taken out.

Heynckes Bayern is what I would call total football. I don't think we're close to that squad. That's what I would want to aim for, and I think to do that we need a strong RM and another CM. Personally I'm not too worried about how good attacking-wise the new CM is, as long as he's quality positionally and defensively. Because I think we might see Matic go full Yaya eventually and become more marauding. At the moment he has to cover a slow CB pairing and shit positioning from most midfielders ahead of him. Especially Fabregas.

Cuadrado's purchase has me more and more annoyed. Because you're right, it doesn't make sense for us to get another player. We're a revolving door at the moment. And yet mikel is still here (I cry myself to sleep every night I see him play). I think we need to sell another attacking midfielder. And obviously Mikel and probably Ramires. But we've spoken about this before.

If we could sell Oscar for big money then I would love to say Pogba and Bale.
Of course I think Bale's deal has a fairer chance of going through if Adidas agree to fund us again.

One of the main defenses of the Mohammed cartoons I give on reddit is that Muslims always have the option *not* to buy any publications which feature the offending pictures.  Nobody's forcing anything down anyone's throat and in a free society we all get to choose the media we want.

But, if a confectioner is forced to decorate a cake with an image that he/she finds offensive (or else lose his/her job) then there *is* an element of compulsion.  OK you say, that person shouldn't be working in that job if they're unprepared to carry out their duties, but  I think there is an argument that it's OK to allow exemptions in those relatively rare cases where the image offends someone so greatly that they'd rather quit than be made to print it.

Again, it all comes down to compulsion.  I don't wish to compel anyone to do something they feel morally uncomfortable with.  

Edit:  The argument against of course is that you're discriminating against gays if you refuse to make a gay wedding cake.  But is that *really* such a big deal?  I'd be concerned if that was a corporate policy, but if we let *individuals* make the decision to refuse, would it have the potential to result in any serious injustice?

null,false,Zapmeister,null,null,null,"4th year trinity mathmo here, who's procrastinating working. feel free to reply if you have any specific questions. i'm going to break down your sentences one at a time.

&gt; I've now heard that almost all of those at Trinity have competed in the IMO

it's a stereotype that's highly exaggerated and totally not true. you maybe get like 30-40% of new fresher mathmos who have trained for (but not necessarily taken part in) imo competitions. a lot of them know each other. but trinity, like every other college, does take a large contingent of people who aren't crazy enough to have done all that, and only just met the entry requirements. the difference is that all the maths olympiad powerhouses end up in trinity making it significantly bigger (~40 mathmos per year).

&gt; with Trinity supposedly taking in most of the Chinese, Korean, and Serbian maths teams

EVEN LESS TRUE. ok i'll elaborate on this one. there are a few people from abroad who did the imo or close to it, and found themselves in trinity doing maths. however it's a huge minority and it's not true that ""most of the imo team"" from *any* country except for the uk end up doing maths at cambridge. there's not a single chinese, korean, or serbian imo student in my year who did undergrad here.

serbia: only guy i know of is teodor von burg who is the imo's most successful participant ever. he's at oxford. yeah, seriously. *shudder* apart from him i know nothing about where serbian imo students end up.

china: there don't seem to be as many international students from eastern asia who come here to do maths as you may expect. when i was in 3rd year my representation theory supervisor discussed this one with us. basically as part of his job, he had to tour eastern asia to encourage more people to apply to cambridge for maths. in china, he got a pretty salty reception, even from groups of prospective imo students. he says that only about a half of them had even heard of cambridge just by name. he says that they basically all have their heart set on following the ""american dream"" (his words) of going to an ivy league school in the usa to study engineering, which is probably because that's the perception of western culture that's glorified in films/media/whatever that get imported to china, and so they have a skewed perception of western university life. my supervisor wasn't able to convince a single student to even *consider* coming to england, let alone cambridge for maths. yes, some of these are chinese imo students. surprising, right? edit: also remember that cambridge has very stringent requirements for fluency in english (as a second language) for entry, much harder than other universities elsewhere.

korea: no bloody idea where these imo students end up, but it's not here.

&gt; and seeing as I failed to even qualify for the BMO2 I'm feeling quite out of my depth, and pretty inferior. Is this true?

bmo/imo maths and real university maths are totally different things and it is possible to be good at one without being good at the other, as olympiad maths is such a narrow branch of maths. there's correlation, of course, but it's not like you'll feel disadvantaged without that background, especially when you get into third year and get to choose among tons of courses.

&gt; What proportion of 'trinmos' have actually competed in the IMO?

uuuuuhhhhh let me count on my fingers. so there were 35 in my year. *counts* ~~...uh... seven?~~ ~~edit: eight~~ edit: nine, so that's 26%. but quite a few more got close without making the team. remember that only 6 people per country per year get into the imo.

&gt; What proportion of 'trinmos' get SS in STEP?

no bloody idea

&gt; What proportion of 'trinmos' get 1st class degrees?

remember that at cambridge you don't get an overall degree class, but separate classes for each year with no attempt made to give you an overall degree class. about a half. proportion roughly consistent as you go from first into second into third year, but not necessarily the same people.

&gt; Is the frequency of events that require formal wear, i.e. formals and balls, such that it is worth buying a tuxedo outright instead of hiring one each time?

you can probably get away with a suit and tie for formals. for other events it's up to you. i personally rent, but i don't use them all that often

&gt; I thought I should try rowing.

WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF. JUST WHY. if you ever get good, they will not let you quit. (not a rower, but seriously take my word on this one)

&gt; Also, how much do you spend each week?

impossible to say. hugely depends on your lifestyle, how much you're ok with spending, and how big your student loan is.

55: Corner for Chelsea. Cleared. 

58: Amidst chants of ""yid army"", Harrison shoots and the GK puts it out for a corner.

59: Corner handballed. Penalty call ignored. Someone hits the post.

60: Brutal tackle on Onomah. Free kick in the midfield.

64: Stylianidies tackled outside the penalty area, call for FK ignored.

67: Owens off, Paul on. 

70: Chelsea player dribbles at Zenon Stylanides in the box. He's distracted thinking about how to spell Zenon's name and falls over. Penalty given.

Floodle's baker wouldn't be refusing the work because Floodle is an atheist but because he doesn't agree with the cake's message and potentially finds it offensive. 

It's about the product, not the customer. 

In the real world example in the article, the customers had been customers for many years, but they only had this one particular cake refused. 

The Christian baker wasn't refusing them service because they were gay, but because he didn't agree with the cake's message. 

In my opinion the baker should be legitimately able to refuse to make the cake but shouldn't be able to refuse service to the gay customers.

Mairia Cahills allegations say she was raped in 1997, when the RUC still policed NI. 

The RUC are, on a number of occasions, said to have passed information on the whereabouts and arrivals/departures of republicans to police stations, on to Loyalist paramilitaries, whom then would attempt assassinations. And indeed carried out extra-judicial executions of prominent Republicans.

Likewise, Paudie McGahons accusation would place his abuse during a time in which the RUC policed NI.

On both occasions, victims came to IRA representatives, both chose what would happen to the person who carried out the attack, both were urged to go to the police, both failed to do so. What is their complaint here? Did they want the IRA to imprison the accused or what? If you are the victim of a crime, you go to the police.

It turns out I was mistakenly assuming the current tax allowance was £10,600, when it's really £10,000 (possibly because the 2015/16 rate might have previously been announced, like in the Autumn budget or something, and I got confused). But the point stands for between the £10,800 rate and the following year's £11,000 rate. The tax allowance rises by £200, which means the quantity of money taxed at 20% is £200 less, which means £40 difference.

So looking at the £12k earner again:

At £10,800 tax allowance, £10,800 is completely untaxed, and of the £1,200 left over, they pay 20% tax which is £240 tax paid, leaving them with £960 of that £1200, which added to the untaxed portion gives a total take-home pay of £11,760.

At £11,000 tax allowance, £11,000 is completely untaxed, and £1,000 is taxed at 20% so £200 is paid in tax and £800 kept which added to the untaxed amount gives a total take-home pay of £11,800.

So if the tax allowance rises by £200, the tax paid in total is reduced by £40.",null,0,null,1426706826,null,0,false,0,cpj2xgt,null,t3_2zg8ae,null,t1_cpj2xgt,null,t1_cpj2hb6,null,null,null,1427840387,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

It's been a great team to root for and these have been some of the best years of their history. Hopefully it will continue!

I can only recommend that you read up on the history and the traditions. Learn the players - knowing who the players are, how long they have been with the club, where they came from, positions they are good at versus positions they ""can"" play, etc will make all the difference. 

I don't know if you should be thinking that Champions League football and Southampton are one and the same. While there's a remote chance the club can qualify this year, it's a remote chance and not very likely. 

Be careful about this summer and the news: obviously a few great players will leave - probably Schneiderlin, Clyne, and one or two others, but we have a great Academy that is always producing more. If Koeman sticks around we will still be solid. If Koeman moves on to a different club I trust the board will find another amazing manager. There will be a lot of panic and sad news, but the club will survive and improve.

Remember that Le Tissier was the greatest, Rickie Lambert is a legend, and Ali Dia was an embarrassment in the club's history. Just give it your all and you'll be wonderfully enchanted.

First was help to buy, which has done nothing to help increase the supply of new housing, and now an ISA for people saving to buy a home. Sounds all well and good, but they'll do nothing to help build new housing stock, and will only drive the cost of housing up further.

The mere necessity of answering that question before tackling the supply-side of the housing crisis is exactly why nobody seems to want to do it - telling the country we need to lose the countryside to build more homes, or telling the country we need to put everyone in high rise buildings if we want more homes - good luck getting elected after that.",null,0,null,1426706997,null,0,false,0,cpj31as,null,t3_2zg8ae,null,t1_cpj31as,null,t3_2zg8ae,null,null,null,1427840444,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

What difference is there to the rationale between child benefit and free schooling? One is paid directly into the beneficiary's bank account and is means tested, the other is paid directly to the school's bank account and is not means tested. Two factors that have no relevance to the issue at hand. All that is relevant is that the government pays money and the individual benefits. If the individual is paying less in tax than the value of the benefits he receives, he is a net recipient of benefits and according to your logic the taxpayer is subsidising his employer. 

I am not suggesting to actually restructure the payment of benefits and government services in this way, the point is the structure is irrelevant to this particular discussion, it's abstract thought.

Like was mentioned below, Yellowstone is less than a 6 hours drive east from Boise and is possibly the best national park in the country. Grand Teton NP is right next door and is also incredible. 

8 hours away to the south in southern Utah near Moab is Arches National Monument/Canyonlands which are both absolutely spectacular, more desert-type scenery. Another 4 hours from there will take you to the Grand Canyon, which I don't need to describe. 

About 10 hours north of Boise is Glacier National Park which is absolutely spectacular. Check out pictures online.

Closer to Boise, you have the Nez Perce national forest, the Sawtooth Mountains, Snake River area, and the Craters of the Moon national monument. I went on a family vacation in the Sawtooths when I was a kid, and it is beautiful out there with plenty of fishing/hiking/horseback riding/etc. options.

The PSNI formed in 2001.

Paudie McGahon's horrific kangaroo court took place in 2002.

The PSNI formed in 2001.

Gerry Adams meets with another victim and relative of Mairia Cahill in 2005. As (many times in fact) before though, he makes the educated decision to do precisely nothing about this information (the mythical ""cause"" must always come first of course)

http://sluggerotoole.com/2014/10/20/mairia-cahill-uncomfortable-truths-for-sinn-fein/

In 2005, Jennifer McCann SF MLA admits receiving information on the Mairia Cahill case. Like the Dear Leader though, she also makes the conscious and educated decision that the best thing to do with this information is precisely... 'nathin'. 

The abuser continues to live life of Reilly. A ""hero"" in fact of the apparently ""glorious"" struggle.

Ditto then again in 2008.

And we can't even excuse McCann on the basis of her ""many other responsibilities"". She doesn't have any.

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/05/sinn-fein-minister-resign-rape-case

All of this is of course on the premise of accepting that Sinn Fein ""couldn't possibly"" report child abuse to the police in the period 1998 (Second ceasefire and GFA now established) to 2001.

Because, you know, the self-declared ""war"" was still ongoing.

We can expect around 1 million children under the age of 14 to live in the West Midlands (From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Age_structure and population of 5.6 million). Theres more because these cases would count up to the ageof 16 but we are low balling it where we can't get accurate figures.

The abuse rate is hard to determine but lies between 1.9% and 25% across their childhood (probably closer to 25% than 1.9% from: http://www.victimsofcrime.org/media/reporting-on-child-sexual-abuse/child-sexual-abuse-statistics

At an absolute minimum rate (1.9%) there will be around 20,000 abuse cases coming to pass every 18 years.

Assuming that the abuse takes place over 18 years and everyone is victimised once (sadly not at all realistic but, again, lowest possible numbers) we's expect around 555 cases in this 6 month time period covered in the report.

In addition, this number includes people ""at risk"" so the true estimated number of abuse cases is lower.

TL;DR this number is, in context, either a relatively good thing or a low estimate but, in no way, is it a large number.

I realize that Champions League football and Southampton are not one in the same. Its difficult because the idea of regulation is a completely foreign concept to me as we dont have anything like that in American sports (which is a shame, it seems like a really cool idea I wish more sports would adopt) I admit I am pretty new and ignorant to a lot of this stuff so Im just going to shut my mouth, listen, and try and learn as best as I can. 

So the next match is against Burnley FC on the 21st. I plan on streaming the game and joining the game thread here. IT says on google that the match starts at 8am. I dont know if google is showing me the 8am start time as correct or not for my time zone. Im in California...any idea if this is correct or not? IT would be perfect if so, as I have the mornings free almost every day. I work nights and I would be able to watch the match with a few beers as the sun rises before sleeping all day.

The Koeman thing and the idea of many players leaving is exactly why I chose this team. The exact same thing is going on right now with my San Francisco 49ers...our amazing coach was fired despite the fact that we sucked for a decade and he came in a made our team not only relevent again, but we were one of the top 3 teams in the NFL the past few years. He was fired because he didnt get along with our spoiled brat owner. Now some of our best players have left to other teams, and some of our other best players retired at ages 30 and 24. Its been a horrible week to be a 49er fan and Ive always liked this sport so I wanted to find something different to devote my time too. Im glad this sub has been accepting so far. I promise not to be an embarrasing American fan.

It's the accounts that make up the bulk of the fee because the software we use transfers the info over into the tax module which generates the tax return (though maybe with a bit of data entry for interest etc). Ignore the breakdown on his fee note, the accounts and return elements will subsidise one another. If you still need him for accounts then I doubt it'll make any difference at all, he'll probably be doing exactly the same work, at most he'll just be pressing one different button. 

If your accounts are *really* simple, there's already some app that can (maybe...) do it for you. I've not seen it in the flesh but someone was telling me about it, even handled filing his company accounts for him. It will require a willingness to learn a few basics about tax and reliefs etc though. 

edit: I suspect the winners will be people who currently only get income from payroll, bank interest and stocks &amp; shares portfolios with investment management firms. These sources all are/will be submitting their bit of the info to HMRC and hence there won't be a need to do a tax return. Your sole trade however, the government knows nothing until you submit the return.

Now there are some points I am not clear on. Did they sign the original contract, send it to you, then you signed it? In which case you then have a contract. But it would be odd if they could unilaterally extend the contract... as you said any variation normally requires consent of both parties unless the contract says otherwise.

Suddenly having 20k in a Santender account will actually get 3% and not the 2.4% it's effectively paying for basic rate taxpayers. 

A good way to look at it for those with a decent amount of capital, is that it effectively boosts the ISA allowance by a one off sum of around 15-30k (depending if basic/higher rate taxpayer and getting returns at ~3%). So use the ISA allowance each year in S&amp;S and keep the emergency fund outside the ISA wrapper and still avoid tax.

&gt;Into this worrying situation is inserted the wild card of Tony Blair’s appointment as
special envoy to the Middle East. He has been appointed by the Quartet of the US,
EU, UN and Russia that are supposedly taking forward the road map to peace in the
Middle East but which in practice is completely moribund. Serious commentators
were astonished by this appointment. The man who had dishonoured his 10 years in
office as Prime Minister by his deceit over the Iraq war and his unconditional support
for Bush over Iraq, Israel’s bombardment of Lebanon, the boycott of Hamas after its 
ictory in the Palestinian elections and his swallowing of neo-conservative rhetoric on
“the war on terror” and “the clash of civilisations”, **had persuaded President Bush to

We have more people, people are living for longer, people are not being educated about where to go for healthcare (111 is a load of shite and just tell you to go to A&amp;E anyway) and so are a burden on the facilities that they don't really need. 

I think a separate branch of emergency care needs to be set up, we need 24 hour GPs for a start to ease the burden on A&amp;E. The more expensive cancer treatments need to be included (for fuck's sake, its the NHS, it's in the strongest position possible to play hardball with big pharma and I don't see why the drugs are still so pricey). The UK lags behind in cancer treatment so that needs addressing. From my experience, and I have seen a lot of GPs over my years, but some of them are lazy. They don't seem to have made any effort to continue their professional development, i.e. they just google our symptoms and look up the drugs in a book. I know data is not the plural of anecdote but it has happened way too many times to be a coincidence. GPs need more rigorous scrutiny as they are the front line in a lot of medical cases and if they aren't up to scratch cancer diagnoses get missed, people don't get the referrals they deserve and have more problems further down the line etc.

The NHS is recognised as the best healthcare system in the world, it is the jewel in the crown of the UK and I absolutely love it, but it needs a financial boost to make sure we can keep it going in all its glory.

Then when the public find out about these loopholes all of a sudden these companies are ""evil"", ""not paying their way"", which is a silly way to look at it because of course a company is going to look to pay as little tax as possible.

So, let me instead ask the question: 

&gt;Should it be illegal for a baker to refuse to make cakes depicting an interracial marriage if he had a strong moral objection?

Well, let's imagine what would happen if it *were* legal.  I suspect that 99.9% of bakers would have *no* problem whatsoever and even  bakers with racist outlooks wouldn't want to turn down business or look like racists.  And the remaining 0.1% of bakers, who actually would refuse, would find themselves subjected to outrage and boycotts and all sorts of public opprobrium, very quickly losing all their business.  

So, would it really make a difference?  Maybe not as much as you might first imagine.  

So, why not just outlaw it anyway?  Just to be safe?  That's a tricky question for me, because I think that as far as possible it's preferable to keep the state out of the business of forcing people to do things against their private moral objections.  

To be honest, I doubt I'd ever get riled up about a law which penalized those who refused to depict inter-racial wedding cakes, but I *would* get a bit nervous about compelling Muslim employees to print images of Mohammed.

Exactly the problem I'm facing at the minute. The course I'd absolutely loved to do costs £10k. I simply can't make that work at all, it'd take more than a couple of years working to save enough money as well.

Fully funded MSc courses are few and far between in my topic of interest and grants are massively over subscribed.

Not complaining, that's life. It's just an unfortunate situation. 
Fortunately it looks likely that I can get funding elsewhere for a different MSc so it's swings and roundabouts I suppose.

Personally, I think the grass is always greener, and Martinez is the man for right now.  He's got security and backing after signing a new contract for the second straight season, and he's clearly making investments in the future of the club at the expense of the present form.

Examples:

* He won't bring in a keeper in January if he feels the price is too high, thus hurting the depth of the team for money that we can use in the future.
* Sells Eto'o despite being relatively short at striker due to a bad attitude.
* Gives rest to players who seem to need it when he can, and puts players back out after mistakes.
* Pays a bit more now for Lennon's wages so that he has an option to buy later.

I see this all around with his transfers and his tactics.  In order to play his style, he needs the right players and they must have confidence.  Even with that, more mistakes will happen when we push players to do more with the ball, and keep it longer and take chances with it.

When I saw that Instagram stuff the other day I thought someone at the club had gone a bit retard. But now I just think good on the club because the media sets the fucking footballing agenda in England and they have too much power and have done for years.

This isn't just about Chelsea. Don't think it is for one minute. People have been complaining about the newspapers reporting blatant rubbish for years in this country and there's no balance. Well, if they're going to constantly report with bias or ridiculous levels of hyperbole there should be somewhere people can go for the facts. 

Reading some of the comments here it's almost as if people either don't read what's written about us and other clubs on a daily basis, they don't care or they've simply forgotten. 

This week alone we've had the BBC taking stupid little digs. It's pathetic and immature. Lineker and his snide little comments, Lawrenson's relentless fucking whining to anyone stupid to place any stall in what he says and Alan Green calling Chelsea players cretins during a live radio commentary.

Should we ignore that? Because if we do, we've already lost, that's how much power the media has in the UK. This isn't about rising above anything, it's not about going to down to someone else's level, it's about pointing out obvious inconsistencies in reporting and officiating. It's about giving some voice to everyone who's every felt hard done by because of the poor standards of officiating and the perceived bias against their club. 

Until the sensationalist drivel stops pouring from the presses of almost every single UK newspaper and other media outlets, I hope it continues unabated because we need to go back to objective reporting on football in this country and it needs to happen soon.
