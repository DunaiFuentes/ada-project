Copyright isn't the only license - it's just the only one that people tend to think of, at least at first.

We can still have intellectual property respected and the original creator can still make money from it without it being as massively restricted as it is now.

There are some really fine creative commons licenses for example. You know this website? It's probably sitting on a Linux server with CC licenses or some similar licenses on it. If someone copyrighted that stuff and it was enforced - things like reddit wouldn't exist.

Also the music industry isn't suffering because copyright isn't tight enough - it's suffering because it's just too damn tight! For every 19 pounds a regular copyright respecting user spends, a pirate, someone who doesn't really respect copyright, spends 26 pounds. Pirates are showing us in real time that copyright being broken is exactly what the digital economy needs.

If you're worried about the artist themselves, the music industry is the most exploitive industry on the plant and movie producers are turning over constant record profits. The artists never get their due and it's not because of pirates or anti-copyright campaigners, it's because these huge companies horde copyright and choke out the artist from sharing, often, their own work.

We also find when trust is placed in the public, through companies like Humble Bundle who release games DRM-Free for $0.01 (so less than one penny) users, especially on the Linux community, pay up to three times the RRP.

Generally the only companies that do suffer are the ones like EA that do absolutely no fan service and release what are essentially faulty games (riddled with bugs... and a game you can't get a refund on).

Thanks for asking :)

I can't see anything I particularly dislike or stands out as bad to me, but it is also lacking in some areas I would like to see more (e.g. enable increased modal share of cycles through storage facilities and routes, more on public transport etc) but then it is only an outline plan and it does touch somewhat on them.

A good place to get an idea of what some people consider negatives is the ""summary of responses to the submitted plan"", although be aware that all those responses will have an innate bias in some way. There are some legitimate concerns raised in there and also some people just tooting their own horn (Xscape, Midsummer Place/Intu and Barret Homes stick out for that). Perhaps the plan is a bit restrictive, and not flexible when economic conditions change or unexpected needs dictate, and potentially idealistic at time when pragmatism is needed, but that is a hard balance to draw.

The real problem is I have no idea what the current plan that they are proposing to replace is, so I have no basis for comparison whether this one is better or worse. The previous one is evidently older and would have been dictated down from a more national framework than the local one outlined here, so perhaps it is safe to assume this would be better, but can't be guaranteed. It is important to note that both plans still have to meet the same central government requirements, most notably 5000 additional homes within CMK, so it doesn't affect those requirements either way. Also developments of national interest can also supersede this plan if dictated from central government.

Also be aware this is a fairly unique referendum, in fact the first of its type in the country. Neighbourhood Plans are as a result of the Localism Act 2011, allowing more local influence in planning. Neighbourhood Plans have gone to referendum before elsewhere, but only for primarily residential areas (e.g. small towns and villages). This is the first time it has been done for an urban central business district area, so is pretty uncharted territory!

Edit: One key difference I perhaps have identified is the principle of ensuring the wide boulevards are retained. The proposed plan (voting yes) makes efforts to ensure these are retained to keep the existing 'look and feel' of CMK. While existing planning frameworks I think do not do this, allowing or even encouraging developments right up to the steetside like the Hub is. This allows higher density developments, getting more from the available land, but at the cost of parking and the lovely feeling of space you get in the boulevards.

null,false,ault92,null,null,null,"* Form a devolved Parliament for England
* Reduce Westminster to 100 MPs, allocated to each country based on population (8 for Scotland, 83 for England, 5 for Wales, 3 for NI, 1 speaker) and elected by a PR system (so, if 1/3rd of the english voters vote for party X, party X gets 1/3rd of the Westminster MPs for england)
* Normalise the transfer of powers to devolved to the regional parliaments so that all had the same powers, and any additional powers would have to go to all the devolved assemblies.
* Devolved parliaments have control over all taxation and spending. UK govt charges devolved parliaments a UK subscription fee based on population share for shared services eg defence, foreign relations/embassies, etc. (UK spent Â£100bn this year, so scots pay Â£8bn, england Â£83bn, etc).
* All elections are based on Instant Runoff Voting.
* Scrap HS2
* Money saved from HS2 funds BT rollout of FTTP nationwide, a couple of times over. Broadband considered a basic right, just as Electricity, Water, etc.
* Build more Nuclear Power plants to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
* New animal welfare law banning ritual slaughter, banning steroid, growth hormone, and antibiotic use in livestock, banning badger culling and strengthening the hunting with dogs law. Cannot be repealed without a national referendum requiring a 2/3rds majority.
* Gradual Phase Out of mortgage interest tax relief, to be balanced against house prices to avoid a crash. Any increases in average house prices would cause an automatic reduction in mortgage interest tax relief, this way stabilising house prices with a goal of breaking the business model for landlords and encouraging home ownership.
* Ban on letting agents. Not just their fees, but the entire business practice. Landlords deal direct and manage contractors etc themselves. Advertising and screening services that charge LANDLORDS a one off fee allowed.
* Repeal of planning restrictions, allowing building on greenfield sites, barring national parks. If a piece of land is deemed suitable for housebuilding, it must be built on, or the landowner is charged council tax at the same rate it would be were the site developed.
* Council tax weighted per head. A group of 6 people stuffed into a tiny house should not pay the same (far less per head) as a single person. Single occupancy reduction increased to 50%, there should not be a tax on not having a partner.
* Merge National Insurance and Income Tax, eliminating the false belief that our tax rates start at 20% (it's 32%) and go up to 40% (it's 42%), making the system more transparent. (rates corrected by /u/Rebelius )
* Legislate to eliminate Employers NI whilst mandating a one off pay rise for all PAYE employees equal to the amount paid previously in Employers NI. I would then increase the new combined Income Tax/Employees NI by the same amount. This would not affect labour costs for employers, tax revenue, or take home wages, but would make wages comparable between the UK and other countries on a like for like basis and show Employees the true taxation level rather than pretending it is 20%.
* CEO wages capped at 100x the lowest paid worker, based on hourly rates. If an organisation chooses to pay for outside management consultancy, this fee to be considered as the CEO's wages, and subject to the 100x cap (e.g. can't split Tesco PLC into Tesco Stores PLC and Tesco Management PLC, as then you can only pay Tesco Management PLC 100x what you pay to a shop assistant).
* Pay increases in an organisation to be capped such that someone with a higher magnitude increase can't have a higher percentage increase than anyone with a smaller magnitude increase. So, if the CEO is on Â£100k and the checkout girl on Â£10k, and the CEO is after a Â£10k pay rise, he needs to give the girl a pay rise between Â£1k and Â£10k.
* Bring in the death penalty for violent criminals where the evidence of guilt is overwhelming, this being a higher standard of proof than ""beyond all reasonable doubt"".
* Eliminate the foreign aid budget entirely.
* Stay in the EU, but pass a law requiring us to use our veto to block the addition of *any* new EU members.
* Phase out the state pension entirely, leaving those without private pensions to fall back on income support.
* Reduce protections of copyright law to authors life+10 years. In the case of corporate authors, 25 years. Characters and settings remain in copyright if they have been used again within the protected period (e.g. superman 1 the film may be out of copyright, and anyone can copy it, but derivative works featuring superman cannot be made as ""man of steel"" is less than 25 years old)
* Legal right to ""own"" software and create mods for it. You can sell your mod if you like and Bethesda cannot take a 45% cut. You can't be banned by Valve from launching the game (e.g. ""game bans""), although they can stop you joining their multiplayer server
* Council tax bands scale mathematically with house value rather than starting at A and going to H, it would go on forever as your house is more and more valuble (I guess this is a mansion tax...)
* More privatisation of the NHS, in that private companies can bid to provide services on a like-for-like, lower cost basis. Only because I deal with the NHS through work and the amount of waste I see scares me. ""We don't want to be more efficient as then we might lose headcount and all my staff are my friends!!!"" ""We don't want to centralise admin functions as we want to rule our own little empire!""
* Fully integrate health and social care budgets. One person should not have a separate care plan from the NHS and from Social Services, and often conflicting care objectives. Community Nurses visiting people with physical and mental/learning disabilities should also perform the role of social workers.
* University Tuition free, student loans replaced by a small bursary, funded by a graduate tax. Each subject to have ringfenced budgets, so money earned by engineering graduates funds the next generation of engineers. Will also kill off pointless degrees, and make others a labour of love rather than profit. ""David Beckham Studies"" would cease to exist. English Lit, Photography, and Art would attract very little funding, but Science and Engineering would be extremely well funded. Government adds money to the pot for any subjects we are short on (e.g. we need more nurses, add Â£x billion to the fund for nursing)
* Establish a UK Solidarity fund. Monies previously put into the foreign aid budget would instead be put into account held by the UK government, and monies could be claimed by any constituent nation (eng, scot, wales, ni) in the event of a crisis or national disaster. Providing the fund currently stood at a level equal or greater to the last 10 years claims against it, the contributions would be reduced to 10% of current foreign aid budget levels as a ""maintenance"" level, and other nations would be allowed to claim from it in a replacement for the foreign aid system. Priority would be given to EU and Commonwealth countries. No foreign claim would be allowed to reduce the fund below the 10y level.
* Eliminate the TV license. BBC can fund itself via adverts like everyone else. I already spend ages between programs watching adverts for other BBC programs, may as well watch adverts about cars and beer instead and save some money. ""Niche programming won't get made!!"" is another way of saying ""there is some crap program we want to make that costs a fortune and only two people want to watch, so let's make all the people that don't want to watch it subsidise it"". Screw that.

This is sort of important in very charged debates where lots of misinformation is flung around. A good example would be a change to the procedure surrounding prosecution of sexual offences (for the sake of argument lets go with anonymity for defendants) - the debate is made unpleasant by many people and it could be viewed as political suicide to take *any* side or engaging in anything but a superficial and pandering fashion.

A few people have said to me that I ""don't look like I'm taking it seriously"" and things like that. 

We're not a party of rosettes, slick suits, and doublespeak. We're trying to move away from the kind of politics that's let everyone down, and bring in a new era of openness, transparency and honesty. The first step towards that is cutting out the BS, and representing ourselves honestly. I mean, if I am not able to represent 'me' fairly and honestly to you, how can you trust me to represent *you* fairly and honestly in parliament? I am what I am; you can't learn anything important about me just by looking at me. What you need to know about us is that we work hard, play hard, and we democratise *really* hard. That's what being a Pirate is all about.

1. Barely anybody pays full price, its just too expensive. When we start the pitch, people are immediately turned off by the price, so we have to give a 'discount.' Having a high starting price means that a discounted ticket is still expensive. Everyone wants a discount, and the lower the starting price the lower the final sale price. My average tickets are probably around Â£12.

Well, we got around 9,000 votes in the 2014 Euro elections in the North West. That shows clearly there's an appetite for what we do. We're working hard to spread our ideas; by building a following we can add legitimacy to our campaign, and that empowers us to do more. It's a hard slog, with FPTP and constituencies that have been gerrymandered to within inches over hundreds of years, but reaching people is much more than just a count of votes. Putting the spark in peoples minds that there is a real movement and desire for radical change, and empowering them to make a different choice is really valuable all by itself, even if they end up voting for Green or whatever. Every party has a valuable part to play in the overall democratic system.

Compulsory voting, with a ""none of the above"" option on ballot papers, and votes for 16 year olds in all elections. Regional assemblies for the English regions and give all devolved governments the same powers. Review the role of the monarchy, though probably not change anything. Replace the Lords with an elected senate, with members only allowed to serve one term but with the possibility for that term to be as long as they want. Ban corporate donations to political parties and cap private donations at Â£5000 per household per year. Scrap MPs' second home allowances but provide accommodation close to westminster for those whose constituencies are outside Greater London.

* Economy: lobby against TTIP. Probably bring in stricter banking regulations but I don't know enough about this. Invest in hi-tech manufacturing nationwide. Immediately raise minimum wage by Â£1 an hour.

* Welfare: commission a report into bringing in basic income in the long term. Short term, means test all pensioner benefits except the basic state pension, scrap workfare and sanctions, ensure all benefits rise in line with average earnings, but no faster (so no ""triple lock""). Look into raising the retirement age beyond current plans, in the long term.

* Tax: something like 10% income tax on earnings under Â£15k, 45% over Â£100k, 60% over Â£150k (though without advice from the treasury I have no idea how much this would raise or lose). Keep personal allowance where it is, for now. Force councils to reevaluate properties for council tax banding.

* Education: reverse some of the cuts to universities, with the aim of reducing tuition fees, if affordable. Scrap state funding of faith schools and free schools and prevent creation of any more academies. End charity status of private schools. Ensure sex and relationship and citizenship education are done properly.

* Health: end market orientation of NHS commissioning, bringing services back into state control as contracts end or as soon as possible. Bring back primary care trusts or something similar, though allow doctors more input than they had previously. Increase spending and invest in mental health care. Decriminalise possession of all drugs, look into legalization and regulation of some, including cannabis.

* Energy and environment: Ban fracking and construction of new coal power stations, and gas power stations above a certain size. Subsidise a new generation of nuclear and invest in research for nuclear fission, electric cars, and low carbon air travel. Set legal target for CO2 emissions to be 90% lower than 1990 levels by 2045. Regulate research into GM crops and limit the lifespan of patents. Campaign to encourage lower meat consumption.

* Europe: push for greater UK influence in the EU. Block accession of new countries for at least 10 years. Discuss possibility of pooling defence spending for a European army. Lobby for more sensible fishing quotas, in attemp reduce waste in the fishing industry.

* Immigration: make it a condition of moving to the UK that the government decides where in the country you live for the first 3 years, so that local services aren't stressed by large influxes of population in short time spans. Offer asylum to a number of Syrian refugees.

* Housing: set target of 300,000 new homes nationally per year, built on brownfield land where possible and with a good chunk of those being social housing. End all tax breaks for private landlords. Heavy tax on residential properties which are occupied for less than 2 months per year, but no blanket mansion tax.

null,false,Quagers,null,null,null,"Its fairly complicated but in essence the banks loan to book ratio (Loans/value of assets) has to meet certain requirements. Loans and Assets (including customer deposits) are classified by how risky and liquid they are and weighted to account for that. Risky loans will require more capital behind them and illiquid assets will count for less.

Thats the static assessment of the banks current situation, on top of that the BofE and EU conduct stress tests which are basically big ""what if"" war games. For instance in the last set of BofE ones set the following scenario,

&gt;This yearâs stress scenario incorporates the following elements:

&gt;* A synchronised global downturn affecting Asia and the euro area in particular, and amplifying global disinflationary pressures;

&gt;* severe financial market stress with a reduction in global risk appetite, particularly in indebted economies, reductions in market liquidity, and some defaults of counterparties; and

&gt;* a slowdown in the UK driven by the downturn in its trading partners, fall in confidence, and correction in market risk appetite. Additional monetary stimulus is pursued in the UK and elsewhere, lowering and flattening yield curves.

If under these conditions banks loan to book ratios fall below certain thresholds they are penalised. These penalties can include fines, bans on paying dividends etc.

None of this existed before the GFC, in the US they had a legal minimum capital ratio and in the UK we had an informal one but there was no or limited stress testing with fairly gentle scenarios.

Full details of the BofE's stress tests are given here,

null,false,danltn,null,null,null,"Almost no bank will charge you for regular transactions in the UK, including a standard bank transfer (faster payments).  Most will charge you for purchases outside the UK, for that I like the Nationwide Select Credit Card which offers 0% on purchases.  This requires a Nationwide account but is free (and Nationwide have decent support.)

If you feel you will be withdrawing a lot abroad and want a *debit* card that offers 0% on foreign currency withdrawals, the Nationwide FlexPlus is good.  However there is a Â£10/month fee (the 3% interest sort of covers this, (ish)), but with excellent benefits (especially with a partner.) however as you have stated you do not want these (take a look), I recommend  you Google for alternatives for 0% currency withdrawals.  (e.g. Halifax Clarity *Credit* card.) Someone will probably chime in here anyway.  I prefer debit cards for currency withdrawals personally.

To send money abroad, everything I have read recommends an alternative service such as (but not necessarily) TransferWise, who usually beat bank costs by quite a lot.

For bills, the Santander account is good and it offers a great interest rate on Â£20K.  The Santander credit card also offers great money back on fuel/trains and a few other things.

The message to get from this is that there is no one best bank account, to get the best you may want at least two including any credit card.

I know of no bank who doesn't show you transactions online for free.

Arguably the best card I am aware of is the Nationwide FlexOne, but you need to be young to get it sadly :(

I've been vague here but please do ask follow-up questions.

After not firing one for years I got the opportunity to fire a ruger .357 and at 15 ft I put all 24 rounds down on the 1ft by 1ft target. Granted I wasn't bullseyeing - but the spread was reasonably good per 6 shots and if I hit you at 15 ft I'd have put them all in you. 

Thats why they give things like glocks and rugers to cops - they're point and click. Really easy to use. But a shotgun will fucking spatter a human head if its buckshot.

If the Conservatives win enough seats in the general election to retain power, it will be their reputation for economic competence and Labourâs for the opposite that does it. Are these reputations deserved? Not as much as conventional wisdom has it, would be my answer.

The story we have been repeatedly told has three elements: first, Labour profligacy was responsible for the chaos the coalition inherited; second, the austerity of the past five years has produced a remarkable recovery; and, third, continuing on the same path is the way to return the economy to health.

Simon Wren-Lewis, who teaches macroeconomics at Oxford university, even labels the elements of this story myths. So what is true and what is less so?

In its latest World Economic Outlook , the International Monetary Fund states that the UKâs cyclically adjusted fiscal balance was minus 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product in 2008 and minus 9.9 per cent in 2009. But in October 2008, it had thought the same deficit would be 2.9 per cent of GDP in 2008 and 2.8 per cent in 2009. The IMF has changed its view of the past. But nobody had that wisdom before the crisis.

What role, then, did fiscal mistakes play? The Office for Budget Responsibility concludes: âIt is hard to argue that the tax and spending policies implemented in the early and mid-2000s were in themselves an important cause of the crisis and recession. But there were undoubtedly weaknesses in fiscal management during that period.â

Thus government spending did indeed grow too fast before the crisis. But the ratio of spending to GDP had been very low in 1999-2000. A period of faster growth in spending than GDP was justified. Again, the cyclically adjusted deficit should have been perhaps two percentage points of GDP smaller than it was. Yet if it had been, and if the ratio of net public debt to GDP had also been 10 per cent lower in 2008 than it was, the fiscal deficit and net public debt would still have soared. Since the government never found any difficulty in selling debt at very low interest rates, the difference in the debt service burden would have been negligible. Moreover, the pre-crisis ratio of debt to GDP was very low by historical standards.

So the view that the UKâs crisis was essentially due to Labour profligacy is false. This mistaken belief allows people to ignore the weaknesses of the private economy, which was more fragile than thought in those pre-crisis years.

Turn now to whether the recovery has vindicated the coalitionâs austerity.

One response is that the coalition ended up delivering not its own plans but those of Labourâs March 2010 Budget, as is shown in a New Policy Institute paper. Yet Labour might not have delivered what it promised, particularly under Gordon Brown, prime minister from 2007 to 2010. Maybe it took George Osborne, Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, to deliver what Labour promised.

Another response is that fiscal tightening did indeed slow the recovery significantly. This is consistent with the OBRâs own analysis. When interest rates have reached a floor, fiscal tightening is bound to weaken demand and output, argues Professor Wren-Lewis. Moreover, even if aggressive monetary policy offsets fiscal tightening, it may impose its own costs via unsustainable asset prices or excessive credit expansion.

Yet the more fundamental point is that this has been a disturbingly weak and unbalanced recovery, not a strong, healthy one. True, it has brought forth a welcome improvement in employment, but only because of a collapse in productivity growth. Moreover, notes the NPI, the growth in self-employment has soared from just under 40,000 a year between 1987 and 2007 to almost 140,000 a year since 2009. Before 2007, self-employment accounted for 16 per cent of jobs growth; now it is 45 per cent. One must ask what sort of jobs these are. Self-employed jobs that do not pay much may well be better than nothing. But they are hardly a triumph.

What, then, of the next parliamentary term? There is a real difference between Conservatives and Labour on fiscal policy, though both promise tightening and not even Labour is prepared to argue for significant tax increases. This means fiscal adjustments will continue to be on the side of spending. The difference is that the Tories seek an overall fiscal surplus and Labour a surplus on the current budget. The former also means lowering spending to ratios to GDP barely glimpsed in half a century. Such a low level is unlikely to be achieved or, if achieved, sustained.

In brief, my assessment of the records of both Labour and Tory-led governments is that neither party is competent. Neither showed healthy scepticism about financial services. Neither tackled the growing crisis in the supply of housing and consequent overdependence of the financial sector on lending secured against it. Under both parties, the economy has been too dependent for demand on household borrowing and spending. Not least, UK prosperity lags: in GDP per head (at purchasing power parity), the UK is behind not only the US, Germany and France, but also Singapore, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. If productivity growth fails to recover, this relative position must grow worse.

The time has surely come to shift the focus from the obsession with fiscal deficits and debt. These were neither the cause of the crisis nor the solution. Whatever one thinks of the fiscal policies of the coalition, a weak and unbalanced recovery from a huge recession is not a vindication. The UK faces really big economic challenges. It confronts equally huge questions about its place in the world and in Europe, as well as its own constitutional future. Neither main party offers convincing responses to these challenges. Have no illusion: real competence is not on offer, either in economics or, in truth, much else.",null,0,null,1430848261,null,0,false,0,cqzasgm,null,t3_34yqhm,null,t1_cqzasgm,null,t3_34yqhm,null,null,null,1432787091,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Some observations they made.

UK has in-depth reporting and investigations of all maternal fatalities - (almost every other country bar Ireland, Netherlands and France) DO NOT track maternal health for the year after the birth so we will always have more incidents because we monitor for longer. 

The UK includes in maternal death statistics not just death at birth but ALL  types of maternal death that occur six weeks prior and post birth of the child. So these include anything that could be related to the birth of the child such as suicide through natal depression, heart failure etc.
   
Virtually no other country does this, they only include straight death through child birth.

The WHO was forced to admit that most of the other countries just do not have any thing like the kind of data collection and monitoring of mothers that is done in the UK so they had to rely on crude data that just says  ""Yep she didn't die whilst having a child""

The UK is actually in the world's top 4 for statistics on infant and maternal mortality - as above it's us Ireland, France and the Netherlands all about equal.

Or Payments? Anything that is paid through the online banking facility for example, qualifies as a EFT as far as I know.

The Scientologists know what they are talking about and everyone looks at the documentary about them and thinks the members of that group are under the power of some sort of conditioning. 

There is a very strong parallel to the cultural systems that are conditioning everyone. Some people in Scientology realise it's an horrendous system of abuse but they can't speak about it because Scientology has info about them or they are just scared of being ostracised by their nearest and dearest or they just can't bring themselves to fully acknowledge their belief system is designed to bring people under control in order to suck out their life force.

Do you follow? 

A lot of those people in Scientology know a lot about it and can speak of it with great authority.  

Some of the major people in Scientology got really badly fucked over. At the point when they really understood what a horrible organisation Scientology is, they escaped and then felt brave enough to talk about what a shitty, abusive and controlling thing Scientology is. But while they were inside Scientology they didn't think it was just an all encompassing mind-control system. 

And people watch that and understand all about how the Scientology people are under a form of mind-control but you can't tell them they are also under a form of mind-control.

Labour did a lot of things right against my grain. Trying to swap us to the Euro, ID cards for every citizen, mass surveillance, PFI... loads. However, Brown did handle the economy with more sense in the disaster situation than the Tories did - the VAT down, PAYE up, meant VAT tax revenue was increased and so was money through employment. He also sold the gold off so we didn't plummet deeper into recession. Shame they then used that cash to bail out the banks and part of the crash was the deregulation of the banks... so while their damage control was certainly better than the Conservatives, the damage itself is also partly their own doing.

null,false,Dardanator,null,null,null,"It's often bothered me that the debate on student funding seems to focus on tuition fees rather than living costs. Whether you're poor or well off before university isn't a good indicator of the position you'll be in after graduating, and how well off you are after is the important thing when it comes to loan repayments. High fees don't actively prevent anyone from going to university - they may serve as a discouragement but they do not render people incapable of going. The cost of living while at uni, often higher than what maintenance loans can provide, is what decides whether or not people can go, not tuition costs. People do drop out of uni because they can't afford their living costs. Many students will need to rely on savings and their family's money. For poor students there is a lot of support available in the form of grants from student finance and often bursaries from the university.

Successive Scottish governments have been praised for introducing or maintaining free tuition and I think they've gotten an easy ride because many people think that's all that matters. Despite it being the case that the maximum maintenance loan available was not much more than Â£1000 per year such that many students needed to take loans out from banks. This system seemed to encourage students to attend only their local universities so they could live at home and save money. The SNP raised the maintenance loan to around Â£5.5k in their second government which is one thing they have done to improve it. I don't agree with Nicola's reasoning that the prospect of high debt discourages many people from attending uni - it may have for her when she was young and had it for free, but I don't think many people today would be as concerned when so many people have student debts that are re payed under very lenient terms such that the debt isn't dangerous to have unlike a commercial loan debt.

My main criticism of the student funding in Scotland is that it encourages students to stay in Scotland (offering no tuition fee support for students studying elsewhere in the UK,  unlike the Welsh system). I think moving away from home for university is a great way to broaden your horizons and experience new people with new ideas. For me it challenged a lot of my perceptions, and undertaking a big move has made me a lot more willing to do it again. I think I would certainly have turned out different if I'd attended my local universities.

null,false,RobertTheSpruce,null,null,null,"Thursday is the day of the week following Wednesday and before Friday. According to the ISO 8601 international standard adopted in most western countries, it is the fourth day of the week. In countries that use the Sunday-first convention, Thursday is defined as the fifth day of the week. It is the fifth day of the week in the Judeo-Christian liturgical calendar.

The name is derived from Old English ÃÅ«nresdÃ¦g and Middle English Thuresday (with loss of -n-, first in northern dialects, from influence of Old Norse Ãorsdagr) meaning ""Thor's Day"".[1][2] Thunor, Donar (German, Donnerstag) and Thor are derived from the name of the Germanic god of thunder, Thunraz, equivalent to Jupiter in the interpretatio romana.

In most Romance languages, the day is named after the Roman god Jupiter, who was the god of sky and thunder. In Latin, the day was known as Iovis Dies, ""Jupiter's Day"". In Latin, the genitive or possessive case of Jupiter was Iovis/Jovis and thus in most Romance languages it became the word for Thursday: Italian giovedÃ¬, Spanish jueves, French jeudi, Sardinian jÃ²via, Catalan dijous, and Romanian joi. This is also reflected in the p-Celtic Welsh dydd Iau.

The astrological and astronomical sign of the planet Jupiter (âJupiter) is sometimes used to represent Thursday.

But while it is very rare for a party to have a absolute majority of voters. They do have a majority of seats. This is why most of my comment has mentioned seats. 

The reason I say SNP can never have a mandate in the UK is the only run in ~ 56 out of ~ 650 seats. that is well below 10%

And while I will always support the argument FPTP is crap. In each of those seats they are the one party that has the most votes. Voting for small parties under FPTP really dose give support to the big party you are least likely to support. 

AV was crap. But it was a better system then FPTP. And voting against is very much used in the UK as a vote for FPTP. Basically while clegg had no balls in the fight for change. The people of england either did not care or were not willing to compramise on a better system that was not perfect.

null,false,codeswinwars,null,null,null,"&gt; 1) We aren't using them as a primary striker so how the hell would a third string striker be at fault for a title loss? 

I don't think this really takes much explanation. You need proven back ups, Drogba played a lot of games this season and he did just well enough to secure points when needed. If he hadn't done that - and there's no proof a youth player would have an impact whatsoever at this level - then the title could have been lost. Pretty clear how a 3rd choice can impact title chances.

&gt; 2) Costa nor Remy not reliable? Are you high? 

Costa has missed 11 matches. Remy has missed 12. Many have overlapped requiring the use of a third choice striker and that's when it's easiest to drop points. I'm talking about reliability as a factor of fitness, not just their ability to score.

&gt; 3) Remy (our real backup) has seven goals and two assists in 969 minutes. He is doing fine. 

Which is fantastic but useless when he's not on the field which, again, is a problem when he's injured at the same time as Costa and this has happened repeatedly.

&gt; 4) After all that, somehow Bamford is ok to play as a backup.

What I meant was that Bamford could be a third choice if a striker with a better fitness record replaced Remy. I would not take him now because he lacks experience at this level and could potentially be called to play a lot of matches. He also doesn't fulfill the build required to play Drogba's role at holding up play which is unfortunate. He'd be better off getting experience but if there was a situation where he didn't need to be relied upon then he could be okay as a third choice. Unfortunately with the current set up he may be put in a situation where he's pivotal for the team's title chances and he's not ready for that.",null,0,null,1430850443,null,0,false,0,cqzc6x4,null,t3_34yj99,null,t1_cqzc6x4,null,t1_cqzbk64,null,null,null,1432787822,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

No Fracking - Cost Neutral, we're already at a surplus for energy in Wales.

Better Recycling - Neutral. Less litter picking and the street sweepers having to collect the wind-blasted recycle debris that aren't collected properly wouldn't be needed. Instead these jobs would be re-assigned to recycle sorting.

No Dog Fowling - Can be a marginal increase to costs for more dog bins or neutral if you simply duel-purpose existing bins. Relatively low cost there at worst, however increased fines and changing the PSCO patrols would create some revenue too, so if you pushed me for an answer I'd also say cost neutral. It's important to note however that the council tax revenue collection in most of Bridgend is astronomical for what we get back - so there is quite a reserve pot to dig into.

Porthcawl seafront regeneration and those kind of schemes can often be obtained through European grants. In fact that's what the last regeneration scheme down there was from (you can still see the euro-wales signs there)

Schools - while there is the initial set up costs of the bigger school or expansion thereof, you can cut administration costs by updating the school systems to electronic. Often there are large rolling costs with the admin in school. For example posting letters home (paper, ink, postage costs). Having online accounts for school dinners instead of them spending for admin staff to process cheques too. We should also make a case to Europe as currently we have HUGE computer suites in schools but tiny classrooms as Europe do not allow you to use the computers for schools budget on anything else - this needs to be rebalanced so we actually have a school to put the computers in first. Creating money locally does work for keeping the running costs down too - for school trips and those kinds of things. Solar on school rooftops has also proved to be a positive way of reducing costs in the long term for schools.

EDIT:

Missed these two:

Mobile signal deadzones wouldn't cost us anything - we would simple nationalise OpenReach as it is an essential service, practically a utility now and it would reap the benefits of having private firms run virtually on it's network - more money for the government and it can be redistributed fairly instead of going into shareholder pockets. However should costs become clear at some point and the private firms won't budge, we'd simply apply pressure onto companies that they are not providing proper services to customers by allowing deadzones... and we can always legislate that if they are to be a provider in the UK they must provide adequate coverage.
That might sound hard to do but if you look to Europe, many places have made carrier locking on mobiles illegal - so taking on the network carriers can be done.

Community cohesion should save money, as less police will get called out. Generally the police/PCSOs on patrol just need to invest some time with people.

He's fed up of being hated for doing what I think he see's as an unfortunately necessary evil. I think he feels he is under appreciated for making difficult decisions. 

Cameron inherited the country at a shitty time. The money was gone, debt was at a record high and the world through up challenges like Lybia, Syria, Isis, Iraq, Ukraine, European growth slowdown, record domestic protests, domestic riots ( he looked genuinely scared by them ) and a Scottish referendum.  The worst part is he has had to face all these challenges with limited spending room and a cut down, battle weary military. I think he's had a shitty time of it and he wants out. 

Milliband comes across to me as a loser who's easy to get the better of, easy to dominate on an interpersonal/psychological  level.  I've seem him week after week at PMQ's getting owned by the tories again and again. He's weak, easily flustered and once beaten stays beaten for a long time.  He's also bad a presenting himself and socially awkward.  Recently he has got better on all these fronts but he is still behind. 

Farage. More Confidence that actual ability. Doesn't care too much what people think of him which is a useful trait for protecting his sanity and pushing forward unpopular ideas but also makes him lack empathy. I think he genuinely likes to have a laugh.

Clegg.  Not as weak or as stupid as people thought he was. Has improved as a leader over the last 5 years. He kind of comes across as a bit slow and nice but I think he knows the lie of the political landscape much better than people give him credit for.

The problem with monetary financing of debt (which is what you are talking about when you say the BoE would ensure the UK economy doesn't go belly up) is that when the government does this things tend to go wrong, like really wrong. All bouts of hyperinflation are due to printing money to finance government spending. 

But even if we ignore the risks of hyperinflation, have the BoE bail our the state by setting an inflation target of around 15%, it would still damage the UK in a number of ways. We'd lose a lot of economic credibility with investors, who would see our economic policy as being closer to Argentina than Germany, companies would be concerned that the UK was becoming unprofessional/unreliable and not invest or create as many jobs here. Also when debt was low again and inflation returned to normal, it would be harder for the UK to borrow money, and by that I mean that we would have to pay a higher interest rate.

Here is a paper than explains it nicely: 
http://www.rbs.com/content/dam/rbs/Documents/News/2013/02/inflate-away-debt-problems.pdf

I would summarise it as follows: **the budget of a country is a lot closer to that of a household than you might assume; clause: given that the central bank is independent and has been set a low steady inflation target.  Under a situation where monetary policy is not independent you'll likely have a whole host of other problems.** Therefore in the long run the best thing a country can do is to have a low inflation target (there is extensive literature on this) and low levels of government debt (which minimises the interest rate on debt payments).",null,0,null,1430851598,null,0,1430852068,0,cqzcxah,null,t3_34twfk,null,t1_cqzcxah,null,t1_cqz1av2,null,null,null,1432788166,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

But I think the reason we have soundbites etc is in part because of people's apathy and ignorance. It's like a vicious cycle. You can't expect politicians to provide the world and more for everyone. You can't have it both ways. It's a lot easier to point the finger at them, the minority, or elites etc. etc. (not that they have no role in this, but it isn't all about them).

If 'the people' want to hold them to account they need to inform themselves and act wisely rather than act on populist demands (i.e. like overgrown children) who think everything should be spoon fed to them by the government/the media in whichever way they decide based on whatever their own mood is at any given time.

Annoyingly, the bulk of them are 'Missing Email' now we can assume it is POP3, but only the engineers can access the servers to see those POP3 connections, now (even if it is) that email can't be recovered.

So what is done instead? we have frontline ask the users if they use mail clients (we strongly recommend IMAP connections, but people stilluse POP3) we (my team) then change the password on the account (since we have no access to the servers, but have the knowledge and expertise to handle these investigations) and once changed carry out testing to prove account works, if our test mails are received it is returned to the customer citing POP3 connection to account and the emails cannot be recovered.

Yes, they are wrong.

As a child from a family with a widowed mother of three (at the time) young children, I see through the bullshit that pro-austerity/welfare cut parties throw out.

My mother worked several jobs at a time and still had to rely on welfare that today, is being cut more and more, with less and less available to help those in need. At the end of the day, even working right around the clock, she managed to survive feeding herself and her three young children on a food budget of Â£23/week - does that sound reasonable? Cause it doesn't to me. Many nights I went to bed hungry.

&gt; Most people who get up to work each morning end up getting rather pissed off with the cider-drinking feckless brew-claiming class.

Fucking sickening comment, but I wouldn't expect more coming from you. The expected fraudulent claims coming from those on benefits accounts to less than 1% of those on benefits - remember that the next time shitty thoughts like 'cider drinking feckless class' come into your head, you cunt.

SEA, I have kept these stories for a long time but I think today it is worth sharing some of them with you. It's true that family matters should be solved internally and not in public but I am doing this so that hopefully all families can learn from what happened in mine. Also keep in mind that none of this is about money. 

At the age of 17, with my first wages as a footballer, I built a house for my family and made sure they are safe. As you all know, I have received the trophy of African Player of the Year in 2008. I also brought my mother on stage with me to thank her for everything. In that same year, I brought her to London for various medical check ups. When my daughter was born, we contacted my mum to inform her but she immediately hung up the phone and didn't wanna know hear about it. Reading your recent comments, some people said my family and I should consult T.B Joshua. In 2013, I gave my mother money so she could consult him in Nigeria. She was supposed to stay for 1 week; but 2 days into her stay, I received a call saying she left. Apart from all that l also gave my mother a great amount of money to start a business of cookies and different items. Naturally, I allowed them to put my name and picture on them so they can sell more. What else can a son do in his power to support his family?

A couple years ago, I bought a house in East Lagon (Ghana) for $1.2 million. I found it normal to let my older sister, Yabo Adebayor stay in that house. I also allowed my half brother (Daniel) to stay in the same house. A few months later, I was on vacation and decided to go to that house. At my surprise, I saw many cars in the driveway. In fact, my sister decided to rent out the house without me knowing. She also kicked Daniel out of that house. Note that the house had about 15 rooms. When I called her and asked for explanation, she took about 30 minutes to abuse and insult me over the phone. I called my mother to explain the situation and she did the same as my sister. This same sister says I am ungrateful. Ask her about the car she is driving or anything she is selling today?

My brother Kola Adebayor, has now been in Germany for 25 years. He travelled back home about 4 times, at my expense. I fully cover the cost of his children's education. When I was in Monaco, he came to me and asked for money to start a business. Only God knows how much I gave him. Where is that business today?
When our brother Peter passed away, I sent Kola a great amount of money so he could fly back home. He never showed up at the burial. And today that same brother (Kola) is telling people that I am involved in Peter's death. How? He is the same brother who went and told inaccurate stories about our family to ""The Sun"" in other to take some money. They also sent a letter to my Club when I was in Madrid so I could get fired. 

When I was in Monaco I thought it would be good to have a family of footballers. So I made sure my brother Rotimi gets into a football academy in France. Within a few months; out of 27 players, he stole 21 phones. 

I would not say any anything about my brother Peter Adebayor because he is not here today. May his soul rest in peace. 

My sister Lucia Adebayor keeps telling people that my dad told me to bring her to Europe. But what would be the purpose to bring her to Europe ? Everyone is here for a reason. 

I was in Ghana when I received the news about my brother Peter being seriously ill. I drove the fastest I could to Togo in order to meet him and help. When I arrived, my mother said I could not see him and I should just give the money and she would solve everything. Only God knows how much I gave her that day. People are saying I didn't do anything to save my brother, Peter. Am I a fool to drive 2 hours to Togo for nothing? 

I organized a meeting in 2005 to solve our family issues. When I asked them about their opinion, they said I should build each family member a house and give each of them a monthly wage. 
Today I am still alive and they have already shared all my goods, just in case I die. 
For all these reasons, it took very long for me to set up my foundation in Africa. Every time I try to help the people in need, they had to question me and all of them thought it was a bad idea. 

If I am writing this, the main purpose is not to expose my family members. I just want other African families to learn from this. Thank you. ",null,0,null,1430854145,null,0,false,0,cqzekic,null,t3_34ykjx,null,t1_cqzekic,null,t1_cqzdcjq,null,null,null,1432788942,null,21,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,21,null

So while I completely agree a lot of the work in the trenches will be a local councillor, an MP has a lot of swing behind that and a lot of influence when meeting with business owners or developers. There is no shortage of work to be done from either end.

I actually had this same conversation with someone on facebook with porthcawl recently. We were talking about the failed housing and supermarket plans, here is my reply:

&gt;""No surprise to those falling through huh. I've seen a lot of housing estates plonked right on the seafront and because the land is so precious the houses are often of a really poor quality or too cramped. Plenty of examples of that in Barry for instance.

&gt;For the solutions we should look outward. Take Bristol, they have attractions that compliment the seaside, they even managed to encourage an aquarium to set up there. If we look at blackpool, they have Colosseum style, sandstone coloured steps on their seafront, instead of tarmac rolled over the pebbles.

&gt;It shouldn't be beyond our imagination to make Porthcawl somewhere people can't stay away from, rather than us reverting to ""saving"" it.

&gt;Even if the budget is incredibly low, you can take a look at Barry Island, they made it so easy for cyclists and had beach huts for rental just by changing paths and putting up huts. Climbing walls are certainly a lot less to implement over a whole housing estate or super store too.

&gt;I'm also a fan of the Pirate mini golf centre down Barry Island.

- A (normal) general election must be held on the first Thursday in May in the fifth year after the previous general election, although the Prime Minister can order, through the use of a House approved Statutory Instrument, the election to occur up to 2 months after this date. Parliament is automatically dissolved 25 days before this date. There is no longer any Royal Prerogative to dissolve a government. (Before the act the dissolution of parliament, and thus the date of the election was decided solely by Royal Prerogative 'advised' by the prime minister with a statute requiring the parliament to expire and dissolve after 5 years (the PM/Queen had generally dissolved parliament much earlier than this). There was no requirement as to how long after dissolution a general election would be held.)
- Failure to pass a Queen's speech or a budget does not automatically mean a vote of no confidence (previously they were de facto motions of confidence). In some senses, this actually resolves a constitutional issue that caused the Australian 1975 constitutional crisis (i.e. what happens the budget was approved by the lower house but not by the upper house - this new bill basically says, the same as any bill)
- The only bill that counts as a vote of no confidence is one that includes the phrase ""this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government"". This can be passed by standard parliamentary procedure as an early day motion (a simple majority - the supermajority aspect you refer to was proposed but was axed). The house then has up to 14 days to revolve that ""this House has confidence in Her Majesty's Government"", else an early general election is held with parliament dissolved 25 days before polling day.
* An early general election can be called explicitly if two-thirds of the seats in the House of Commons resolves ""That there shall be an early parliamentary general election"".

You're right in principle though that this makes coalition and minority governments more stable than they previous were. The only ways to start an early election are to wait 5 years, obtain a majority in a motion of no confidence against the government, or obtain a supermajority in a motion to call an early general election (even a motion of no confidence against the prime minister or the prime minister resigning does not constitute a vote of no confidence against the government). A budget can be defeated and renegotiated without destroying the government. 

Reading up, it turns out that the concept of being able to run a minority government without a confidence and supply agreement is completely new territory for Britain. The government only needs confidence now, and the worst case is that we go into a US style political deadlock over the supply aspect (although I think we're slightly better off as unlike US republicans, the Conservatives, Lib Dems, and SNP are less likely to play brinkmanship with budgets).",null,0,null,1430855103,null,0,1430856131,0,cqzf63h,null,t3_34xpwg,null,t1_cqzf63h,null,t1_cqzdofo,null,null,null,1432789225,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Here in the US, I would find it easy to pick out most people's general area of origin a lot of the time. I'm wondering if this is the same in England? How common is it for someone to be able to have a general idea of your hometown area specifically from your accent? I'm curious whether his accent is more difficult to pinpoint than most or whether people's accents tend to be less specific and the fact that his can't be definitively placed is normal?

Also, do many people generally have ""mixed"" accents, where certain words clearly sound out of place with the rest of their regional dialect? I've come across it on occasion, in the US, where certain words sound out of place (often when their parents have a strong accent from a separate region and they only pick it up for a few obvious words) but usually accents are generally consistent.

Is the difficulty in pinpointing his examples because they sound generally ""regionless"" (like newscasters seem to go for) and it's only the few regional variations that make it more obvious where he is from?

I repeat because I think the question is key to this discussion; As such I don't see a point in moving much beyond it without an acknowledgement of your view on that specific point.

&gt; Iran and Ukraine are the only states without nukes?

I chose those two (Ukraine especially) as examples of nations with no nukes that had been invaded. I presume your argument would be that the presence of nukes would not have prevented those invasions, and since we don't know for sure let's try a different angle.

The UK and France are Europe's two primary nuclear powers, they're essentially Europe's nuclear deterrent, with obligations binding European nations under NATO  (side note: there are US 'gravity drop' bombs in Germany, Italy and Belgium, but they are generally regarded as being a highly questionable deterrence)

Other European nations agreed to not pursue nuclear capability under the non-proliferation treaty, and a big part of their persuasion and reasoning was the binding of UK and France to those nations under NATO. If the UK were to dismantle its nukes that leaves only France with a retaliatory capability, in turn that increases the chances of France being wiped out and not being able to respond to an attack, that is, it greatly weakens Europe's nuclear deterrence.

The wider point is that the UK pulling out has many consequences, one of which is other nations potentially forming their own nuclear warhead and missile programs on the basis of feeling exposed to nuclear blackmail from nations such as Iran, Russia, China, North Korea. Secondary to that is a *lot* of political fallout [unintended pun] for the UK within Europe.

Given all of that I think that four submarines with operational 40 nukes in total is an entirely sensible strategic position given the risks involved around possible destabilisation of the NPT around the world.

It was these voters who voted on principle who paved the way for our first Green MP.

This part is key. If you want a genuine multi-party democracy (and not everyone does, but lots of people do) you *will* probably have to stomach 'wasting' your vote a few times in the process.

You can't wait until everybody else is voting for the fringe party you like and it's 'safe' to do so, because you don't when that's going to be the case. Vote for the candidate/party you actually want to see in power.

Of course implementing Bristol/Blackpool into Porthcawl isn't going to happen. We're not going to get a Porthcawl Tower or basically our own bridge like Bristol has. I'm with you that far.

So we look at the smaller, more feasible options. People like something to shoot for, an activity or landmark. We don't need sweeping beach long Colosseum style steps, just in areas where the tarmac has blighted the beach. incentivising businesses to set something like the mini-golf up - worked in Barry, Cardiff, Bristol... it almost begs the question why porthcawl _doesn't_ have one. It's actually one of the more enjoyable parts of politics - visit new places, take their ideas and see which ones best apply to back home. An aquarium style attraction is probably as big as porthcawl could go for right now - but it's not all that much to shoot for... park-dean has just invested heavily in Trecco Bay down there... even more tourism!

Although credit card debt is not a good thing, if you have the ability to use a credit card for everyday transactions and manage your money to pay off the debt in full every month this can add positively towards your credit score, along with being able to earn cashback and extra insurance cover over purchases depending on the credit card company you use.


if you are planning on a house purchase in the next few years  there's a possible first-time homebuyers ISA savings that will be initiated in the autumn, for every 200 saved, the government will contribute Â£50. Be aware you can only open one ISA account in a year (apr-mar) therefore don't open an ISA before then if this is of interest to you (i think!?)


Pension contributions are another thing to consider, depending on other expenditure/savings.

Yes, it's pretty common to be able to do that here.  Even more so if you include the whole of the UK.  There are pretty wide variations in regional accents.

But we are also a very small very crowded place compared to the US and people move around, so you do come across plenty of people with ""mongrel"" accents for want of a better word.

null,false,lawlore,null,null,null,"There is a lot of regionalisation in terms of British accents, and it's generally not too hard to get a rough idea of where someone's from if they're speaking naturally. For a clear example, [this girl](https://youtu.be/sWAUrHODRWM?t=52s) is unquestionably from the Liverpool area, with her strong Scouse accent, and others across the country are equally as distinct from the RP (or, if you prefer, regionless, although it's known as ""The Queen's English"") accent as that, such as [Geordie](https://youtu.be/LdXC_FCqSr4?t=2m8s) in Newcastle. That's true for different areas all over the country, and it's in both accent and vocabulary. There are [certain points of vocabulary that help distinguish where someone's from](http://www.itv.com/news/2013-12-04/is-it-a-roll-bap-batch-cob-or-a-barm/), as well as certain pronunciations that guide you in a certain direction.

His accent is difficult to work out because he's trying to hide it, presumably for the sake of clarity and effect, and because it's not that strong to begin with. In the second video, when he's speaking more naturally, it still comes across as not *that* deviant from RP, which geographically probably puts him not that far outside of the south East. The vowel sounds I picked up on put him a bit further north, but there is, however, a distinct range of accents across the Midlands- around sort of Birmingham- which he also doesn't seem to fit into. In terms of my own guess, there are hints that he's not from London or the South, but beyond that, there's nothing especially to go on, so it's more a process of elimination. He's not from anywhere with a particularly strong or identifiable accent, so that leaves some of the more rural areas just outside of London.

In terms of mixed accents, they're not uncommon, and that's as much to do with immigration and moving around- there are a lot of areas in big cities where people come from all kinds of backgrounds, having learned many different dialects of English- not just all over the UK, but Africa, the Caribbean, other parts of Europe, Asia etc. Of course, they tend to standardise more and more from one generation to the next, but that's assuming there isn't any other influence, which invariably there is.

Finally, to give a personal example, I myself pronounce ""passport"" distinctly from everyone else in my area- I live in the south East and as such am reasonably close to RP, albeit with a lot more dropped vowels. But I also lived in France for a year, and ""passport"" became a word I used on a daily basis, a lot more often than I ever had done in the UK- it was my only form of ID at the time. Where I'm from, I naturally pronounce ""pass"" to rhyme with ""arse"", as does everyone else in the area. In France (and in other parts of England), ""passeport"" is pronounced ""p-ass"" rather than ""p-arse"", and through usage, that stuck with me- ""pass"" on its own is now pronounced ""arse"", but ""passport"" gets ""ass"".",null,0,null,1430858370,null,0,1430858593,0,cqzhale,null,t3_34z23z,null,t1_cqzhale,null,t1_cqzg41i,null,null,null,1432790993,null,9,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,9,null

&gt;What would happen if their campaign was all about possible coalition options.

We would be able to have a serious discussion about the compromises that will *have* to be made after Thursday, potentially preventing widespread disappointment among the electorate. 

&gt;You should vote for your preferred party irrelevant of possible coalitions.

That's a very naive view of politics, especially under the Westminster system where tactical voting is often a requirement to have any influence on the government at all. And your point brings me back to my original one; if your preferred party is actually contemplating doing an underhand deal in order to get into government, you would rightly be pissed off if you weren't warned beforehand. As an example from the last 5 years, the Lib Dems have haemorrhaged support in the wake of their lies over tuition fees. If people had forewarning, perhaps they would have chosen to vote Labour or Green instead of unwittingly propping up a Conservative government. 

Of course a formal agreement shouldn't be drawn up until after the vote, but it is self-serving of the major parties to not discuss who they are and are not prepared to talk to, and where their lines in the sand will be. This attitude only benefits members of the established parties themselves and doesn't really do anything for the people voting them into power.

The way to do it if you're 18 years old would be to take test in the UK, get a full licence, wait 3 years and then convert it to a full Australian licence. NSW RMS (previously RTA) gives you your UK licence back straight away. If you've held it for 3 years, you get to skip all the provisional stages. (For some countries you need to wait until you're 25 to skip the Ps). This means you will get both licences. In the UK, you can use either to drive, in fact it is easier to rent cars with a foreign licence, and you don't even need it on you when driving, you just need to present it to the police within 7 days if requested

OTOH if you have an NSW P1, while you can get it converted to a full GB licence, they will send the NSW one back to Australia, which means you need to pay another fee to get it back. And I don't konw if they will let you skip the provisional stages once you have started, even if you wait 3 years. Maybe if you wait 10 years. Also, if you have an Australian licence, you can't drive on a UK one in Australia. (I guess you could present the UK one to rental agencies, this is what I've done because rental agencies want your licence to be at least 1 year old, so in the first year after converting mine to NSW, I just rented with the UK one but showed the cops my NSW one when I got stopped)


With regards to the residence thing, if you have both passports it's impossible for them to know where you are actually living.

NSW RMS wants proof of address the first time you present yourself there, but you can have bank statements sent to a house even if you aren't living there.


So I guess it's worth trying to get a full UK licence from your NSW P1, (well I know someone who did it 2 years ago, which is where my info comes from, and I haven't seen anything to suggest that the rules have changed), and then wait a few years, tell RMS that you've been living in the UK for a while and see if they will let you skip the extra tests and give you a full NSW licence",null,0,null,1430859309,null,0,false,0,cqzhwt8,null,t3_34ubl5,null,t1_cqzhwt8,null,t1_cqyvtdt,null,null,null,1432791283,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Everyone will be able to tell if an accent is not local, but saying where it is actually from is another matter, as there are many incredibly specific accents that vary from as little as town to town. That said, most people can do the obvious ones (Glasgow, Birmingham, Newcastle etc) along with regional dialects (Northern, black country estuary and west country) not to mention country specific (NI, Welsh Scottish).

As for mixed accents or out of place words, absolutely yes. My dad does it all the time. Normal conversations sound like a generic rural southeastern accent, but ask him to say ""grass"" or ""bath"" or get him angry and he goes back to his north-Northumbrian roots. I think this mainly occurs in people who have moved to one extream of the country to another, but I have heard it in people who live ""on the border"" between two regions. Some people from Lincolnshire for example, sound fairly southern until you hear certain words, or visa versa depending on which end of the county they are from.

I found it a bit hard to get past this.

This is really quite a dubious characterisation of the Black Death - the bubonic plague reoccured in England about a dozen times over three centuries. The number of deaths resulting from it cannot be properly established, due to the lack of census data, and could have been anywhere between 20% and 65% of the population.

Staffordshire experienced rapid development during the industrial revolution, but that was not until several hundred years later - if the Black Death really did kill so few there then it was because the area was undeveloped moorland and forest during the middle ages.

Your figure of 1,200 is cherry-picked, from statements that actually say that ""[mortality rates in emergency care were between 27 per cent and 45 per cent higher than would be expected, equating to between 400 and 1,200 'excess' deaths.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/5008935/NHS-targets-may-have-led-to-1200-deaths-in-Mid-Staffordshire.html)""

Politicians have a list of people that bothered voting, including those that spoilt their ballots. This voter list is all that matters to your average politician. It's what they obsess over.

They get info about the voters, including their name, address, gender and age. This makes all the difference, as it shows the demographics of the voters. The people they have to appeal to. Ever wonder why politicians bend over backwards to please old people? Why are they so eager to throw young people under the bus? Because, from a political standpoint, the non-voting demographic might as well not exist. 

If more young people spoilt their ballots, politicians would have a reason to throw them a policy or three.

Edit: A lot of people mystified.  The politicians won't know who spoilt their ballots, but they will be fully aware if, say, the number of young voters (spoilt ballots or otherwise) triples.  In many places, even a few hundred young voters can swing the vote and so are worth appealing to.

Again, that is the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The bit you're taking about is [section 10](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/10), which says that a person (A) is guilty of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity if:  
(i)B is under 16 and A does not reasonably believe that B is 16 or over, 
*OR*  
(ii)B is under 13.  
  
Given that a 17 year-old is neither under 16, nor under 13 - the 20 year-old would (imho) be clear as far as the SOA 2003 is concerned.  
There's one exception that could still catch out the 20 year-old: That the age limit is *18*, not 16 in [section 17](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/17), but this would only apply if the 20 year-old was in a ""position of trust"".

In short, yes. Partly because it's not clear entirely what you mean by neoliberalism -- it's typically just a pejorative meaning, 'economic policies I dislike' -- and partly because I view economics a moral science, so 'neoliberalism' is a moral position in itself. 

I guess what you're trying to get at is maybe a market economy vs. state welfare economy dichotomy? Or maybe a consumerist vs social welfare one.

I think the radical centrism of the party, sort of like that of *The Economist* confuses a lot of people. Under Clegg, the Lib Dems are effectively Peelites; Orange Bookers who emphasise and balance economic liberalism against social liberalism/welfare. 

Given that Cameron is actually quite moderate for a Tory (on the whole), a good chunk of legislation they would be able to see eye-to-eye on. Hence the coalition's stability. Most people think the SDP faction of the Lib Dems is all there is to them, or that this is mutually exclusive with the liberalism of the Orange Bookers, but this is simply not so.

Markets are good because it's an excellent system for people to _Vote with their money_. Imagine you could start a company just by persuading some government bureaucrat to give you money. How many fucks is that bureaucrat going to give? How rife for corruption when they aren't gambling their own cash. 

&amp;nbsp;

Similarly imagine you could choose what gets made by voting, niche demands would not be served no matter how badly you personally needed them. Populist stuff  would be made in abundance no matter the cost.  Markets are excellent systems allowing people to bet their wealth on what will be profitable to produce and then spend their cash on what they want closing the circle &amp; repaying the good investors, good investors and businesses get richer and make more of what people want. Bad companies are out competed and go bust. Wonderfully Darwinian. 

&amp;nbsp;

So in our supposedly free market economy buying and selling should be almost sacred. Since when you buy something you send a signal to the people who sold it, made it &amp; invested in the above __More of this!__. When companies can't make a profit they go bust __Less of that!__. 

&amp;nbsp;

But there is a bunch of big problems with the UKs economy and markets. 

&amp;nbsp;

* Vast financial sector which is largely little more than gambling (some of it is price discovery, some of it is investing, most of it is not).  
* Businesses based around market manipulation and rent seeking. 

&amp;nbsp;

Take advertising, in an ideal world people would have wants and needs, they seek out companies which can fulfil these most cost effectively and buy their products. Advertising would largely be about giving people information. This is however not the case, what we largely have is vast marketing spend aimed at _creating demand_ this is utterly crazy, not only is it manipulating people into buying shit they don't actually want and which will then not satisfy them [buy coke, it'll make you happy! People will like you! You'll fall in love!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUzPwIP9BqE). But worse all the people involved in advertising are wasting their potential, instead of being useful members of society they're actively working against the good for their fellows. 
It then has a 3rd negative effect which is most of our media is funded by advertising this has the perverse effect of making grabbing eye-balls more important than making content people actually want. Why is buzzfeed so fucking _strange?_ because you aren't their customer you're their product. Why does the telegraph have a very rose tinted view of HSBC? Because HSBC have a fucking huge advertising budget. 

&amp;nbsp;

__tldr;__
So, all emotive advertising and other intentional market distortions would be outlawed, repeat offenders to be executed.  Since we don't want to completely screw the economy we'll phase it in over the 12 months of my dictatorship. 

&amp;nbsp;

All non-economic financial activity to be similarly outlawed, this would be difficult and require very costly funding of enforcement, I am certainly not smart enough to make it happen myself but perhaps I can find some useful experts in academia.

As for Besic and Garbutt, should they have played more? Maybe. However I don't believe Garbutt is ready to replace Baines as some on here have suggested. Baines is still a fantastic player and Garbutt could learn massively from him. As for Besic, yes, maybe he should have had a run in the side when Barry's form dipped, but again, he's had poor games this season. I'm confident he'll reach the potential we all believe he has, but this season when both have been on top of their game, Barry's got to start for me. He's been one of the scapegoats for poor performances this year which have been uncalled for at times but recently he's silenced his critics this season.

I'm behind whatever decision Martinez makes. I genuinely believe he's looking to bring youth talent through by how fondly he speaks of he likes of the under 21's on a regular basis, but only time will tell.

&gt;Rufus Carmichael is a development representative for the food distribution company FoodFreight. He recently became popular on social media after losing a debate over whether his company should be allowed to build warehouses on the common land in a small town. He is famous for his dislike of Anuja (surname unknown), the vociferous member of the opposition who won the debate against Carmichael, but the two have recently started a relationship.

null,false,helix1512,null,null,null,"Well, I know it's a slightly hard term to pin down, but as far as I and most summaries are concerned, neoliberalism is a laissez-faire small-state approach to economics characterised by privatisation, deregulation, free trade, reduced government spending, and tax cuts. Its only pejorative because a lot of people, myself included, don't think thats the way to go.  Neoliberalism is a moral position yes, and one that does not lend itself well to equality of opportunity.

The point of my article was to try and get away from the political jargon that most in the country won't understand (Peelites, Orange Bookers, even neoliberalism), and just take it back to the simple issue of whether people's interests are being adequately represented, and whether policy is being constructed with morals in mind, or economic efficiency. You can't pledge to abolish tuition fees and then not only let them triple, but watch the gap between the poor and the rich increase so vastly. Thats what confuses me about the Liberal Democrats.

Foreign people are totally fine here - especially within Universities. There's lots of international societies and fun events - no one will really raise an eyebrow if you're not from Scotland.
Don't pick Rangers or Celtic - trust me - it's just asking for trouble (sectarian violence is a problem in Glasgow sadly). I'd support Partick Thistle or another local team.
I have a lot of friends that live in the West End and they love it! It's a very 'studenty' area with bars, a few clubs and lots of great restaurants. On top of that you've got great museums and parks! And the city centre is only a short walk/train ride/subway/ bus ride away! I think a vast majority of Glasgow uni students do live in the West End - but other places like Dennistoun have lots of students there (but not really handy for Glasgow Uni students so I wouldn't recommend it for you!)
And a lot of people here are pretty big drinkers - that's definitely a fair sterotype. But I also know lots of people who don't drink much at all or are not drinkers in the slightest. At Uni you'll always meet people who think they can drink a lot (and who think that getting really drunk is the coolest thing ever) but I wouldn't say everyone is a complete drunk.

Always happy to help, especially with the Paris centre which is quite small and so not always easy to get the answers you need from current students :)

Student collaboration is what you make it. This year we have started a Paris Graduate Union which has really helped create a fantastic community. There were 45 of us this year, and we had various events organized such as museum trips, cafes and our final end of term river cruise. We also held events in Canterbury in order to help students meet others on the course. 
We also had a mini conference this year, where you were able to present subjects of your choice. One fantastic thing about the centre is that the staff are so keen to allow the students to make it what they want it to be. So, when there pitch an idea and they'll really help make it reality. 
Kent also organize a series of guest lectures, as do other Universities using the building. You are welcome to attend any (some do ask for a small fee for entry, but not many). 
Reid Hall organize both lectures, book launches and music concerts. They're open to all students and anyone that wishes to attend. Leaflets are placed at the entry to Reid Hall and also on the screens around campus - so keep an eye out! 

In Paris you will have access to the Office Manager, who is a English speaking (American) Paris local. He'll help out with little things you need help with in Paris, and will sort out administration issues with Canterbury too. The Academic Director is always there (bar when meetings in Canterbury are going on) and is happy to help with academic matters. All in all, everything is easier in Reid Hall than in Canterbury. You only have two inter-connecting offices to deal with for everything! Your lectures also come across, and it's up to you to organize a meeting between you and them if you wish to have 'office hours'. But this has never been a problem for me, as long as I told them in advance. 

Firstly, on the French language - Kent will provide you with FREE French lessons before, and during your stay in Paris. So you'll get better in no time. The school collect accommodation locations from previous students and will be happy to give you pointers. They also email round several places as and when they learn of them, or are offered to them. Which area? There are safer areas than others for sure. But you're also restricted to where you can afford and budget. But don't worry - the Metro is super efficient and easy to use! 

The literary Magazine has a workshop in the autumn term. Simply turn up, but your name to a role and that's it. Easy! Then the work begins, but as long as you all enjoy the work, you'll love it. 

If I can help more, or you have any questions at all about the campus, course anything. Do let me know and I'll be happy to answer :) ",null,0,null,1430864625,null,0,false,0,cqzl2cv,null,t3_335ob9,null,t1_cqzl2cv,null,t1_cqxg79x,null,null,null,1432792770,null,1,false,canterbury,t5_2sbso,1,null

Apply that logic to the NHS... *must you feel responsible* if someone gets ill and needs to rely on the welfare and care of the state until they're better?

No one is asking you 'feel responsible' - those on benefits simply ask you don't go after them any more than you already have... *they* aren't the ones responsible for how shit the economy is at the moment, that genuine scum of society is at the other side of the pay scale.

The same issue's true for your point on Coutinho. There aren't that many clubs that could take players from us we don't want to sell and the clubs that could are going to fill such an important position with the absolute best in the world. So yeah, he's not in the same league as players like James Rodriguez and Thiago Alcantara, or as you put it, ""Coutinho is a player that isn't even good enough for other clubs to want to take him from us"". You've made 2 points I agree with and yet I can't agree with you because of the way you seem to come to those conclusions.

On to another point:

&gt;If a club wanted to offer us 30 million plus for Sterling we should rip their arms off for that money.

Do you genuinely think that's how we get better? If we have to sell him, sell him, but that's such a defeatist way of looking at things. The best clubs keep their best players until they're not needed or someone offers ridiculous money, or preferably both. I'm not saying Â£30m is a small sum of money, but if we're selling an English player with potential who's capable of performing how Raheem has, who's capable of doing it in so many roles, who's likely to get much better and who is currently very important to us, then Â£30m is the kind of offer we take when we have no choice. Sterling for Â£30m this summer (well, Â£25m when they see how eager we are to get rid of him)... then what? We go buy a couple new players we can sell off because they complete fewer forward passes than Jose Antonio Reyes did in January 2006?

My skin isn't especially dry or oily. I have mild / moderate chin acne. My face feels a bit tight if I wash with e.g. a foaming cleanser, but lots of the sunscreens I'd tried had looked really shiny. 

First I got the moisturizing version, with a tint. Why? Because the sunscreen I'd tried before had a terrible white caste, so I was extra cautious. I got chatting with another customer in Boots, who was also trying to decide which one to get, and we both agreed we liked a glowy look. The result? I was shiny, patchy, and orange. I do NOT recommend this one. 

I've also tried the shine free version (no tint). If you put too much on, there's a slight white cast. It makes my face look kind of dry and flaky, and finally understand why people on here put moisturiser under their sun screen. 

The best one, hands down, is the 'light' version. No white cast. No flaking. No shine . It's moisturizing. I actually really enjoy how my face looks when I have it on. It sits well under makeup. 

Possibly it's just the goldilocks one for my skin, but I think it's really cut above the rest.

Where do I even start. There is hypocrisy throughout. 

Using data 2004-2008 to analyse growth under Labour (pre-crisis, very good times indeed) and compares it to data  2010-2013 as an indicator of the Conservatives (post crisis-mid recession). After this he clearly states **Growth is significantly higher under Labour.** OF COURSE IT IS! Not because of policy but because of economic conditions. He clears Labour of blame for starting the Crisis (fair enough) but then blames the Conservatives for being in the middle of it. (WHAT?)

He chooses to compare the US and the UK economy whilst citing the only difference is austerity. Is that seriously good enough for you? The recovery of the world's largest and most advanced economy vs the recovery of a relatively large economy with deep ties and reliance on the finance industry (which could have been changed under Labour, but let's ignore that). 

He promotes Government spending as the panacea and that cuts destroy aggregate demand and that the multiplier was significantly underestimated. Of course cuts in government spending decrease aggregate demand but it also increases national savings, lowers interest rates, exchange rates and encourages exports. They aren't the work of some sick capitalist hurting the poor, it is an attempt to stimulate an economy without reliance on the state. Moreoever, he completely ignores that you cannot have an indefinite reliance on deficit spending. The UK can get away with it more than most due to a strong system but risk will increase, no matter how strong an economy/system you have. You only need to look at Greece to show where indefinite and irresponsible defect spending gets you. 

He talks about a reduction in wages as a fault of the Conservative party. This is a factor of the UK productivity puzzle. An issue so complex the world of academics hasn't found a solution. It has factors ranging from weakening trade unions to the mis-allocation of capital (both under labour, but let's ignore that.) Also, what about the high employment because of these low wages? Are we going to ignore that? I thought you Labourites were keen full employment advocates. 

He claims that Labour was right to bail out the banks. (I completely agree!) - But of course much of Labour and the left were all about ""LET THEM FAIL!"" and ""WE SHOULDN'T FUND BANKER'S BONUSES!"" This guy talks as if Labour did it when everyone was against them. The only people against them was the left of Labour.

Dover has the largest castle in England and obviously the White cliffs. 
Wales is cool, nice scenery but also more cool castles. 
Somerset has Cheddar Gorge caves, and they are 100% worth visiting.
Stonehenge is worth a visit. One of the few interesting places here that I have not been, and I am quite well traveled here :(

London is cool, but please don't spend your entire time there. There is tons to see here and a lot of it is more interesting than London in my opinion. 
Lake district and Peak district are both cool places to check out. Scotland probably has some nice places, never been there personally.

Bath, Edinburgh, Oxford and Cambridge are nice places apparently. The Roman Bathhouse in Bath, funnily enough, looks awesome. I also think Norwich is worth a visit, as I said before. It has a much more local feel than London does.

I seem to remember the most costing thing on the Northern Irish economy was the chaos caused by the IRA's campaign, not to mention the civilian casualties caused by both sides of the conflict. I think our involvement in the middle-east is near the bottom end of the reasons our economy isn't doing great. The reason our economy is 'so shit' is because we have had no investment coming in until very recently with the tax cuts, and we can only improve the economic situation (and so increase employment/reduce poverty) by getting more devolved powers to change tax rates. High taxes are being tested in France and other Eurozone countries, and they aren't producing results.

null,false,bluntstick,newcr-1,straya,null,"&gt; I mean what good reason has he to stay? He's not gonna be first choice probably not even second even though he's out performed Baines at points

*At points* being the operative way to explain it. Yes, losing Garbutt will be a shame and yes it looks increasingly likely, but Baines is one of the best left backs in the league and still easily one of our most important players. I don't doubt Garbutt has a bright future ahead of him but obviously when you have a player like Baines to compete with, you ask him what good reason he has to stay, and maybe the answer is, he doesn't have a good one... but Martinez is caught between a rock and a hard place in this situation, and he can hardly be called to blame: I'm pretty sure 99% of good managers, when given the choice between playing a youth player who's impressed for parts of the season and Leighton Baines, would pick Baines every single time. 

&gt; Look how long it took him to finally get the courage to drop Distin for Stones who everyone knew was a better option. It literally took a 37 year old well past it to cost us multiple games for him to throw Stones in. 

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the main reason Alcaraz and Distin got so much playing time this season more due to injuries and exhaustion. Stones picked up a bad injury to the ankle (I think? As I said correct me if I'm wrong) and Martinez had not choice but to play second choice centre backs I thought?

&gt; I mean just because Ross and Stonesy are young and playing well doesn't mean he has a focus on youth it just means they're good players.

See this is the thing, we all need to remember Barkley and Stones are exceptions to the rule about youth, rather than the rule. To be honest, Browning hasn't impressed as much as some people give him credit to in my opinion. It might've been good to play a youth centre back more when Distin and Alcaraz were playing like gash (I think I even said it might've been a good idea back then) but in retrospect, as someone else said, we don't know what goes on behind the scenes. 

&gt; Again with Browning and Hibbo. There was no good reason to start Hibbo at any point this season when we had Browning there waiting for a chance.

Respectfully, I completely disagree. Hibbert played perfectly well every time he was called on this season. Sure, he isn't the fast paced wing back Everton like, but as a back up defender of the old school, he was perfectly good. I'll agree Garbutt should've got a shot the game we played Hibbert at left back though.

&gt; Besic and Barry is the same issue of using the old player for no good reason when the younger player seems to be great when he's played. 

I thought this as well, but as someone pointed out, Besic and McCarthy haven't gelled well yet and sometimes don't play well together, and one obviously isn't going to bench McCarthy. 

I'll agree about Joel though: he was just coming into his own and Martinez took him out as soon as Howard was fit again. It's a shame; none of us thought he would ever get anywhere and after a decent run of games he started looking like a bloody good keeper. I think that was a mistake.",null,0,null,1430873879,null,0,false,0,cqzpzq3,null,t3_34z935,null,t1_cqzpzq3,null,t3_34z935,null,null,null,1432795162,null,6,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,6,null

UKIP want a points system, the Tories have committed to reducing immigration levels and holding an EU referendum, and Labour has set in stone a pledge to control it too. Say what you want, but I really feel as though this Labour party is unlike its predecessor. New Labour was a heinous project which wasn't left wing, and wasn't necessarily for the people, despite claiming to be so. It was a party for the seats and for the power, seeking to make the party re-electable in the present but not necessarily in the future. This is why I have a difficult time accepting the dialogue that Labour is fiscally irresponsible: there are different people in different places (not to say there are not many who remain), and I feel that the party is not really like the last Labour government. Miliband has taken it in a different direction, one which I feel at least attempts to address the concerns of the people, one which stands up to interventionist and pro-US policies, one which acknowledges that austerity is not the right approach, but neither is excessive expenditure.

I've tried looking for a job in IT during my last summer and the only job I've managed to land was a freelancer-webmaster for a small company, which a friend of mine helped me land. The skills I've learned during my FE were borderline useless during that job, and if not for webdesign being my hobby I'd be instantly fired. I'm not sure about your course but the overlap between my FE and the actual working skills were abysmal. 

If you want to get into software development, yes degree is pretty much mandatory unless you've got connections, extensive portfolio documenting you working over a long time successful projects or hands on experience. 

How good are you at programming? - it's good that you're learning now by yourself, I've done the same and first year of HE was a breeze (Average grade of A- here, without a massive amount of effort). If you want to get into software development the C languages are really common, but having a wide range of skills is a good option as well. If you're learning objective languages the skills are fairly transferable, so C# is a great one to start with (since it holds your hand gently). If you want to get into games development C++ is a really popular choice, which allows you to work with DirectX SDK, C# is great if you want to work with Unity engine. 

If you're already learning programming and wrapping your head around it, you're way ahead of half of my HE class at this moment. Sadly there's a lot of people trying to come into industry because ""they like games"", but they are not willing to put effort in order to learn the skills. HE is about self-development and a lot of students are not able to do their own homework. I've had 15% of my class drop out because they ""couldn't be motivated"" to learn programming while being provided with excellent tutoring from teachers as well as great resources. 

TL;DL; If you like programming and you're able to - go into HE (though it might be a bit hard with UCAS since you're a bit late - but there are surely open spaces somewhere near you), if you can't afford to go into HE you might try to land a job, but your chances are pretty slim at getting a ""programming"" one. You simple done have enough skills at this point.

If you like Cityscapes, you can't beat it as they're almost the tallest things around.

Well placed for public transport with plenty of buses using Smallbrook Ringway, New Street and Moor Street Station are a five minute walk, chinatown is even closer.

The flats are OK and there's room to swing a cat if it doesn't mind bashing it's head a few times. Bathroom is enclosed with no external walls, kitchen leads on to large lounge with the bedroom(s) being about 3/4 the size of the lounge. Large windows, with the door to the shared balcony in the lounge.

Heating in my ex's flat was storage heaters on an economy 7 meter. Absolutely terrible for price, so I hope for your sake they've changed that.

This was before broadband was prevalent, so I don't know how you'll be fixed for that. At the time, I lived in a block just up the way that's been demolished and they fitted broadband in that block with no issues, so I guess you'll be fine there. I don't recall seeing a lot of satellite dishes on those blocks, so Virgin may be your only choice.

It's funny that you consider Germany to be on the other side of the scale as most responsible. They also borrow funds in a foreign currency, just like Argentina. Of course the markets generally consider the Euro to be the German currency but they could change their mind if the ECB hints otherwise. No risk of that now but who knows @ the future.

True I'm not saying that countries with debt in their own currency can be irresponsible without problems. Obviously not. But a very responsible country can grow debt indefinitely with no plan to ever pay it all off. That's poor financial planning for a family. Japan faces many problems, but their high government debt isn't one of them really.

I'd recommend continuing to save with the intention of getting a mortgage at some point in your future, but that doesn't mean you have to rush into it as soon as possible.

In other advice, discuss 'rent' payments with your parents in advance. Don't just give them money here and there, agree on something beforehand that you both think is fair. Will you not need to pay petrol + other maintenance costs for you car? You will have an entertainment budget, as well as clothes, some food, and misc. Don't assume that all of your wage will be saved.

As someone of a similar age, your main focus right now should be to invest in yourself - you have the rest of your life for it to pay back.

At the age of 22 I've done things like in-place migrations from SBS2008 to Server2012R2, while also combining another company into the same environment, with little to no downtime to the customer(s) while also meeting budget.

Just last week I performed a disaster recovery plan and executed it, for a client that was forced to run in a virtual environment due to HW failure, performed a HSR restore and had a total downtime of 20mins before the customer could work again (but off their ESXi 4.1 PoS they refuse to upgrade). 

My main concern was that I have no pieces of paper from a registered university/college to prove that I have done these things, however I have really good written references from management of both employer and some customers. This is what I am hoping will make my resume shine.

I'm definitely not expecting 50k+ a year any time soon, I am just after an idea of whether or not IT based jobs should be the only ones applying for, or if I should apply for any+everything.

There is nothing scary about the SNP, certainly nothing scarier than any of the other political parties.

What is scary is the vitriol heaped upon them. Instead of the outrage perhaps people need to ask why the SNP are set to turn 6 seats into 40 or even 50 seats.

THAT is the far more important question and given the polls and lack of under 18 voters people need to ask why so many no and unionist voters have said the will vote SNP.

I do consider Germany to be on the other side as most economically responsible, but its not just me, its also international investors. Germany's fiscal responsibility is underpinned by a constitutional debt brake which forces there government by law to have a balanced budget, which is part of the reason why you see **their bonds be treated as safe haven assets.**

Why is it important to minimise intrest rate on debt payments? Because when you do that you minimise the amount of money to pay to borrow money for any given value of debt. This then **maximises the amount of money you can spend on other things like welfare.**

&gt;But a very responsible country can grow debt indefinitely with no plan to ever pay it all off.

No it cant, not as a percentage of GDP. Have a look at debt sustainability analysis papers from the IMF. A country could grow its debt until its debt stock combined with its interest rate became unsustainable. In such a situation it could try and inflate the problem away but that has all the problems listed in the paper I linked.

If hypothetically we assume that a country cant inflate its debts away then I think its quite easy to see that a country's budget is quite like a household's budget.

The gist of the changes from the OP:

* Natural background colour (not re-coloured)
* ""Barclays Premier League 2014/2015"" text removed
* Text and crest re-coloured a bit to match the 10 more (colour looks the same as the crest from some of our old black away kits too)
* Text and crest moved a bit to align better with the 10
* Text and crest softened a bit (less sharp)
* Resized to 1920x1080

I agree with this article in spirit, to an extent. A Labour government right now would be very much like diving into a lake of piss because you're on fire. Still though, I personally think it's the better option. I mean, I was in the schemes for long-term unemployed (New Deal/Future Jobs Fund) both as a recipient and working as a provider, and I was there when this current government came in, and I have had periods of unemployment under the current government since. Labours approach was very far from perfect, but it was much, much better than what we have now. The reason the Tories haven't made detailed pledges in this area, is because what they want to do is fuck-all; their 12 billion quid is going to come from gutting the benefits system to the point where it will take an act of political will greater than any near future iteration of any opposition party seems likely to muster to kick it back up again. This is a real danger; ditto with the NHS, higher education and so on. Labours policies on most things may be kinda shit, but the Tories will see a re-election as a mandate to continue their current project, and probably to try and get as much done as possible before the next election sinks them. A tactical vote for Labour is sound for anyone on the left, in my opinion; that's not even starting on local politics issues, mind.

Still I believe Labours plan is for compulsory training for under 21s to qualify for unemployment benefits, and only if they don't already have ""the qualifications they need to secure decent jobs"". It's pretty vague and it could turn into workfare, but it's still not quite as bad as the Tories who are explicitly calling for workfare for under 21s, the author is wrong to suggest they are exactly the same. Since neither party can hope to win a majority, it's up to the other smaller parties to block this. I doubt the SNP would allow either of these plans through, but I suspect the Lib Dems might.",null,0,null,1430896710,null,0,false,0,cr00bl8,null,t3_35014u,null,t1_cr00bl8,null,t3_35014u,null,null,null,1432800100,null,4,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,4,null
