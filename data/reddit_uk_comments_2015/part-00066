&gt;___The Joy of Text___ was a themed night of television programmes centred on [text messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging), shown on [BBC One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One).  It was broadcast on 9 June 2001, and featured three TV programmes: *The Joy of Text: Live*, *Text Maniacs* and *X Text*. The first programme, *The Joy of Text: Live*, was a 40-minute entertainment variety show hosted by [Ulrika Jonsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrika_Jonsson) and [Terry Alderton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Alderton), featuring celebrity guests and text-related games. This was followed by *Text Maniacs*, a documentary looking at surprising examples of text messaging use. *X Text*, the final programme, looked at the seedier side of texting.

Disappointed we didn't take more of the chances we had when we were clearly the better team.

Disappointed in Poch's subs, thought we became way too narrow when width had been our strong point in the first half, 4-4-2 with Eriksen and Lamela inverted was obviously not going to work well. Would have honestly rather have seen Eriksen go off than Chadli too, not a great game for him.

Disappointed in them going to ground every single chance they got.

Disappointed (OK furious) at the referee being a horrendously biased pile of crap. Don't really feel like he robbed us of anything major (think it should have been a penalty in the first half but I could have understood a none call) but it was so blatant throughout.

What most of us don't realise is that Sturridge flourishes mostly when he's competing with another Top Striker I.e. Him and Suarez last season. They were arguing all the time and that only fueled each wanting to score their own goals.

Look at how he was after Balo scored that penalty? Awful all night but then he suddenly became Fucking ferocious in his attacking. You could see how determined he was on his face. 

~~I mean he didn't even want Balo to take the penalty because he wanted the goal for himself. Even though he seems fine Hendo taking it, but *another striker*?~~

I think Sturridge has nightmares on having to be displaced by a shit Torres and ageing Drogba at Chelsea, even though he was better than both of them. 

Balo, on top form, is exactly what we need and will also push Sturridge. Hopefully it'll be Balo vs Sturridge from every match now on who scores the most goals.

&gt;For example they had an announcement that the U.K. would leave the E.U. in just over 6 months, to me that seems highly unlikely as they would be able to achieve this goal as there would be an absolute shedload of new treaties to be set up.

Do you think UKIP agrees with you? They've already got their heart set on straight-up abandoning the EU, do you really think they give a toss about negotiations and treaties with the very body they're seeking to detach themselves and the rest of the UK from?

&gt;There are somewhere around 200 countries on the planet a lot of which we would need step up treaties with.

We can set up treaties with other countries without the EU sticking its' nose in. In the instance of countries like the US we already have treaties aplenty, quite a few of which were made long after we sort-of joined the EU.

&gt;I certainly no fan of UKIP but I'm even less a fan of this zero effort dumbed down lowest common denominator shite tv.

If Channel 4's streaming service is to be believed, the entire show lasted just over fifty minutes. That's not a lot of time to put in the kind of details that you seem determined to demand, and from a decidedly amateurish crew.

Honestly, I haven't watched it, I don't feel the need to. They could have been sucking Nigel Farage's dick for fourty nine minutes and fifty nine seconds, but if they spent that last second so much as implying anything bad about UKIP then the result would be the same. UKIP supports don't tolerate dissenting opinion. If you disagree with them then you're part of the Establishment or secretly employed by the Bundesbank.

Follow the model SBO when answering questions.  You can't go wrong.  

Situation -  what happened )not war and peace,  brief explanation

Behaviour - what YOU did.  Bring in elements of leadership, teamwork, decision making skills,  learning from best practices.  The best possible outcome you want and the steps you take to get there, sales skills,  how you engaged with key stakeholders, how you brought about change etc

Outcome- what happened as a result of your actions.  Make this amazing,  make sure it packs a punch.  To tie it all up nicely be thinking here of how it was a positive outcome not only for you but think how it was good for the client/customer,  how it benefited your team, department and the overall business.  How this helped with the overall strategy of the business for example reached targets,  increased sales,  new business.  Then tell how you were recognised in your team for your high achievement. 

When preparing your questions look at the essential and desired abilities of the candidate,  this will stear you in the right direction.

After my second meltdown at my volunteering job, I immediately called a doctor (while on site - fortunately, my aunt also works there and was able to point out the right path to take when I was in distress) and got an appointment for what I think I called ""an anxiety attack or something"". 

Saw the doctor, explained the attack and also the long-running anxiety and depression that's defined much of my experience of life, and got referred to an assessment at a local clinic. Over the course of talking with the... diagnostician (I have no idea what her actual professional title is), I mentioned about 4 sessions in that I suspect the possibility, and on a quick 10-item questionnaire I indicated positively on every item. 

After a few weeks, I got a LONG questionnaire to fill out (which was quite stressful but also cathartic - I got to get a lot of my chest over the course of the assessment which just didn't come up in the actual therapy). Then, four appointments with an assessor who, according to the phone call I had with her last week, has my diagnosis waiting for me on my appointment next Wednesday. The total turnaround from the critical meltdown to the diagnosis has been about a year - it's a slow process.

---

First step I'd recommend is, if you're not already sure of the possibility yourself, to try heading over to somewhere like /r/aspergers - their [FAQ (linked)](http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/wiki/faq) contains some questionnaires to give yourself a good idea of how strong the possibility is. (I sometimes re-do them just to remind myself that I'm not just imagining things - I subconsciously seem to want to destroy my *self,* so it really helps sometimes to prove to myself that I've not just been abusing my family's and my mental health team's patience.)

Moving forward, my advice is that your best bet is to call a GP and say that you have this suspicion - possibly have some of the tests from the [linked FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/wiki/faq) *and* explain how you feel it's caused you difficulties. I took a roundabout way to get my diagnosis through looking at the ""surface"" mental health issues I've been dealing with so it took me a year, but if you go at it more directly you could possibly see the diagnosis after 8 months or so I think.

As for what comes after the diagnosis... I have no idea yet. I've been told some things about gaining access to some forms of specialist help in becoming more independent, and it's going to inform my anxiety treatment once it starts up again (which I'll probably push to deal with the depression instead). 

Whatever happens, I wish you the best with the process. I've found that just knowing that I'm autistic means that I don't feel guilty about the problems I've had. If there's any questions you still have, I'll try to answer to the best of my ability - but I'm just going by my own personal experience mostly.",null,0,null,1424384113,null,0,1424384485,0,coqtgr3,null,t3_2weurh,null,t1_coqtgr3,null,t1_coqqm8g,null,null,null,1424683871,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

2. Hugo was very unlucky on their goal.  He did his job, stopped a difficult shot, and parried it off to the side and wide of the post.  Too bad it took a bounce off of that player's backside and right into the feet of Basanta.

3. Everyone's criticizing Eriksen, but I think he actually played well in the first half.  He was at the heart of our offensive dominance and our fantastic pressing in the first half.  I agree his second half was weak and his passing got more wayward as the match went on.

That's not quite accurate - while the EPR 'paradox' was presented as a general issue in QM, Einstein's writings seem to place him quite firmly as believing that it would be resolve by what are now known as hidden variable models. The core result of Bell-type experiments is that these models cannot reproduce physical reality*, proving Einstein's position wrong. 

Of course it wasn't exactly a considered position - Einstein went with his gut about how reality worked in an area with little data - so it's not *that* surprising that he picked the wrong horse.

These shows generally don't rely on too much local knowledge, and when it does, like when they poke fun at UKIP or Norwich (I studied abroad there at UEA), it's not too hard to pick up what goes on.

But I also like to throw on HIGNFY or Mock The Week when I'm a little less able to pay attention, since it doesn't matter if I miss more topical things I'm not aware of anyway, but I can still enjoy the panel. 

And then there are other things like Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled, which don't quite fit into those other categories, which are still fun to watch.

Henderson shouldn't have let Balo dominate him. Looks bad for him if he wants to command respect. In the dressing room you can be sure that there will be issues with Balo, aren't there always. 

Stevie G said what he did because he doesn't like the attitude Balo has around the team. He has hinted at this previously. He knew what he was doing on TV. Nothing wrong with that. We have a young team with excellent team spirit. Balotelli only buys into it when it suits him. Otherwise it is all about the Mario show, no matter what he likes to say on instagram.

It's not my area of expertise, but my understanding is that legal professional privilege is a common law principle.  That is, it's based on precedent, rather than specifically enshrined in a particular legislation.  Legal professional privilege is fairly specific, however, in that what it protects you from is your solicitor or barrister from having to divulge information you gave them.  *(As I understand it, it has to be in relation to obtaining legal advice.  This means the sort of thing you see on American TV where Saul Goodman tells Walter White to put a dollar in his pocket, so they're covered by attorney-client privilege wouldn't fly here.  (I have no idea if that'd work in the US or not.))*

Now, for all that, they're not admitting to a legal breach in respect of legal privilege.  What they admitted to is an issue in respect of Article 8 rights.  Art. 8 gives an individual a right to ,""respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.""

In fact, they're **not even admitting that a breach necessarily even occurred**.  What that admitted was:

&gt;The Respondents accept that since January 2010 the policies and procedures for the interception/obtaining, analysis, use, disclosure and destruction of legally privileged material have not been in accordance with human rights legislation specifically Article 8(2) of the ECHR.

Or in short, ""Our processes didn't include sufficient safeguards.""

The issue of whether or not an actual Art. 8 breach occurred is **not** admitted to and is still to be resolved:

And here's why.

Which university you go to will matter a lot depending on your career aims in life. By the sounds of it, if you worked extremely hard, you'd get straight As and A*s. With the right mix (i.e. more A*s than As) and assuming you get good A-levels, you'll have a good chance of getting into a Russell Group university, or even Oxbridge/London. These guys look at both your A-levels and GCSE grades. The two are almost equally important.

As much as we don't like it, which university you go to also has the potential to have a huge impact on the rest of your life, as it determines the friends you'll make, people you meet, and to a great extent your first job and subsequent career path. On the other hand, while your social scene may seem like one of the most important things in the world right now, it'll hardly matter when you're an adult. Of course, you could make life-long friends at school, but I and the vast majority of people I know (25, working in London) hardly keep in touch with anyone from school - even guys who, at the time, I considered my best mates. The majority of those guys are, if I'm honest, working fairly dead-end jobs in small cities/towns around the country.

In life you can't get by with grades alone, and it's excellent news that you've developed some social skills and are able to make friends/get on with people without being a recluse. That's really important. If you were still a loner, I'd certainly recommend you got out more and worried less about grades. But now you've managed to develop your social skills, your trade-off is, to my mind, a potential Oxbridge place leading to a network of awesome friends who will all do really well, as well as a top notch career once you get out, versus some awesome mates for the next 2/3 years while you're at school but coupled with a less awesome career.

Just my opinion.

TL;DR Yes, GCSEs are really crap tests that don't really tell that much, but unfortunately top universities care about them a lot, and unfortunately which university you go to can have a huge impact on the rest of your life; while the friends you make at school don't always stick around for life.",null,0,null,1424390079,null,0,false,0,coqwz2w,null,t3_2wfdv3,null,t1_coqwz2w,null,t3_2wfdv3,null,null,null,1424685508,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

I'm now making assumption but I think if Balo started the game, he'd be 1 and Hendo would be 2. The fact that Balo came on as a substitute probably changed things a bit. If Hendo was as confident as Balo, Hendo would have still taken the pen and told Balo to fuck off, which is something that has happened at a lot of clubs before.

In the grand scheme of things and going purely by statistics I don't think anybody can really deny that Balo should be our 2nd choice penalty taker after Gerrard, given his experience and record.

Sturridge seems more bothered by this than anybody else on the pitch, and really given his performance today I don't get it. 

Carragher and Gerrard have differing opinions on the matter, but I'm with Carragher on this one. One of the best penalty takers in the world on the pitch with you at the time, Henderson (who apparently, by the order of things was set to be the taker) doesn't seem to have a serious problem with it. I'm sure he considered Rodger's pre-game set up and roles and I'm sure he considered Balotelli's composure on the spot. That's why he, as captain, elected to allow Balotelli to take it. I don't think Mario handled it the way everyone of his critics would have us believe, and if Henderson wanted to take that kick and believed he had a better shot at it than Balotelli he would have stopped him and taken it himself. 

Then again, I could be wrong. But I find it much harder to believe that a summer signing just overrode the captain's say in that situation, if that is the case then the dressing room situation is worse off than anybody else is aware of, and I don't find that likely to be the case given our team's run of form.

Well I'm afraid it is, because I'm asking you for reasons that it should be legalised, and if one of your reasons is ""It makes us money"" then you can't say that's not a valid argument in support of something else.

My point is that yes, it would make us money if we legalised it, but so what? So would everything else that is illegal. So we don't start suggesting we legalise handguns or speeding or anything else just because it makes us money.

Which again means that what it really boils down to is that people in favour of legalisation believe it causes no or little harm, which I dispute. 

&gt;Likewise the existence of bad laws does not justify writing more bad laws.

Cool, but I'm not suggesting we write any new laws, people in favour of legalisation are the ones trying to change the status quo. I don't need to convince you to write a law to ban weed, you need to convince me to scrap one that is already in place.

I'm not saying ""well law X says this so we should do the same"". I ask people ""Why does this country make laws?"" and it's not because it's purely financially sound, it's not because you think the law will eliminate an activity, it's because we believe that society is better on balance for having the law then not having. It's a way that society prescribes the appropriate and non-appropriate behaviours. We agree to live by these rules, and we get the benefits and protection of the society. The vast majority of the arguments in favour of legalisation are rarely applied by the individual equally across all laws. If they truly believed that, then sure I can respect their argument but I disagree with it.

On the other hand if your supposedly unbiased reasons for wanting to legalise something illegal is that it makes us money and you can't stop people from doing it anyway, but you don't think that's a plus point in favour of say legalising firearms, that's hypocritical and shows an underlying bias.

I'd respect people much more for just saying ""You know what dude? I like smoking weed, and I'd like to have it cheaper and not get arrested for having it on me"". It's not really something you can argue with, it's a democracy, if everyone wants to legalise weed because they like it and not for a load of other bullshit reasons then politicians should do that.

&gt;I'm a firm believer in the idea that my rights end where yours begin.

This is a nice ideal but sadly I've found it doesn't hold up. I mean I could talk about personal rights and freedoms for hours, because nothing holds up to reality. Your rights and freedoms are curtailed on a daily basis for the sake of society.

For example, I park in a disabled space. You turn up, a genuinely disabled person, and see there's no badge, and my car gets towed.

I blocked the disabled individual's right to use that carparking space, which was then used as a justification to take away my right to access my car. Which rights are more important here? That disabled person may have done that despite there being other spaces they could have used, yet my care would still get towed. Most people would agree that towing the car of someone parked illegally is OK, but it's still denying someone's right to access something.

If you want to live in a civilised society, you give up rights and freedoms all the time. I dislike my boss but I can't punch him in the throat when he's being a dick, or even tell him to shut up. If I don't pay my rent I'll get thrown out on the street, but do I have a right to shelter, a right to survive? Is it more or less important than the right of the landlord to use their property how they want?

Every law protects one person at the expense of another. The murderer's freedom is curtailed by the law stopping you from killing other people. The alcoholic's freedom is curtailed when he is arrested and his alcohol taken off him. 

What about the father who was the sole support for a family, who will now be evicted as he just died as he wasn't wearing a helmet? Sure we curtail his rights to ride his bike how he wants, but we are protecting him from a dumb death that would effect the rights of his family. Or is he allowed to risk his life and potentially ruin the lives of his family at will? Not easy is it?

I don't think it's possible to design a lawful society where there is no compromise between people's rights. ",null,0,null,1424392947,null,0,false,0,coqykib,null,t3_2wadad,null,t1_coqykib,null,t1_copm1gx,null,null,null,1424686252,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

I approach it differently, but my ratings probably come out pretty similarly.  I don't have a ""starting point"" per se, but I basically treat 5 as mediocre for a Premier League player.  I give 6s for performances that are ""decent enough, but should have been better."" I give 7s to players who put in a good solid performance: strikers who are consistently threatening and make good runs, wingers who consistently beat their defenders and make dangerous passes, defenders who keep things strong and don't put us in jeopardy, etc.  8 is distinctly successful ... a striker scores, a winger assists, a defender makes some outstanding plays.

I end up giving few scores below 5, mainly because our players are sufficiently above league-average in their basic ability that they rarely put in truly below league-average performances.  When they do, I give them 3s, 4s and 5s.  1 or 2 if they utterly fuck up and do nothing of redeeming value, which is incredibly rare for players of this calibre.

null,false,nolo_me,null,null,null,"&gt;if one of your reasons is ""It makes us money"" then you can't say that's not a valid argument in support of something else

I'm not denying that it's a valid argument in favour of anything else. However, I'm not talking about anything else and I'm not compelled to support anything else just because it shares one pro argument.

&gt; My point is that yes, it would make us money if we legalised it, but so what? So would everything else that is illegal. So we don't start suggesting we legalise handguns or speeding or anything else just because it makes us money.

Here's a couple of examples of things which have one point of similarity in the pros. Despite this one point of similarity, they share other pros which are completely dissimilar from one another and from cannabis, and their cons are likewise completely different. Each issue should be weighed on the sum total of its merits, and not dragged into a discussion of the others as a red herring.

The amount of taxable revenue is an obvious and quantifiable pro that can be set against any financial cons (such as putative cost to the NHS, *which you yourself raised*).

&gt; On the other hand if your supposedly unbiased reasons for wanting to legalise something illegal is that it makes us money and you can't stop people from doing it anyway, but you don't think that's a plus point in favour of say legalising firearms, that's hypocritical and shows an underlying bias.

I've also never contended that my reasons are unbiased, and I've addressed the firearms issue above. I'm merely setting out the pros and cons in as dispassionate a fashion as I can. ""Because I want it to be legal"" is sufficient justification for me, but wouldn't suffice to convince a third party.

&gt; I'd respect people much more for just saying ""You know what dude? I like smoking weed, and I'd like to have it cheaper and not get arrested for having it on me"". It's not really something you can argue with, it's a democracy, if everyone wants to legalise weed because they like it and not for a load of other bullshit reasons then politicians should do that.

In order for politicians to even consider the issue they'd have to examine the pros and cons much as I'm doing here, because they're responsible for things like the NHS and taxation. If I wasn't sure it would actually be beneficial to the country I wouldn't dream of supporting it. 

The other examples you've raised: the illegal parking, punching your boss, failing to pay your rent. In each case, you've *first* infringed on somebody else's rights. 

The father? Well, it's his responsibility to ensure his own safety for the sake of his family. Where do you draw the line? Should he be prevented from riding a bike at all? From operating any motor vehicle? From crossing the road? You can make an argument in favour of protecting anyone, but first you have to examine whether it's actually your place to protect them.",null,0,null,1424395685,null,0,false,0,cor03sx,null,t3_2wadad,null,t1_cor03sx,null,t1_coqykib,null,null,null,1424687038,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Walking away doesn't make you selfish, it would be if he wanted to take the penalty in the first place, but instead he was telling his team mate and captain he should take it if he wants to.

So walking away doesn't make him selfish, it just means he feels unhappy that Balotelli took it when his captain wanted too (Henderson even says he wanted to take it post game, but thought Balotelli seemed more confident)

The definition for being selfish is ""lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.""

Sturridge was looking out for Henderson, which isn't exactly selfish is it. He shows consideration for his team mate, he isn't chiefly concerned with his on personal profit or pleasure, and his ""pouting"" is because he got annoyed at the incident, are you saying you wouldn't do the same? you cant have a go at someone one minute then be jumping all over them the next.

null,false,ashinator,lfc68,,null,"I just do not think selling skittle is such good idea. No one is going to put the money he is worth for us, which is 20m +. Lovren has been shit, Kolo Toure has been average. Selling Skrtel who is now flourishing in the new system having loads of clean sheets and working better as a unit. We do not even know if the new defender will be good enough. The biggest point for not selling Skrtel is that Sakho is injury prone and he is our best CB. If Sakho is injured Lovren will take his place. If Skrtel is gone who are we going to put in his spot? An older Kolo Toure who was decent in some games but are getting pretty old and will most likely only have 1 year left at top level football. 

I can agree that Skrtel is not our future, but we need him for at least 1/2 more seasons. In that time we should be looking to replace him, but no point selling him without having someone bought in and have already taken his spot. Like what happened to Agger, we bought in Sakho and he took Agger`s spot in the first 11. Did not sadly go as good as we wanted it to, where Lovren has just now started to impress on the field. Selling someone without replacing them first is one of the most stupidest things a manager can do. But i agree 100% that Skrtel is not the future, but we would be stupid just sell him and lets say Allen this window. It would be suicidal, where we would start over again, take a couple of months before we finally starting to perform and maybe this time we are not so lucky that we still have a chance to get into top 4.

Can has all the makings of a world class midfielder, no doubt. But Henderson is much more imbedded in this club and has really worked for his place in this team. He is a much better option as captain. His mentality is great, his only weakness is his inexperience in the role. I'm sure he'll work hard and grow into it. 

You argue we could evolve into a bigger team with all the potential we have, but we already have an incredible midfielder in Henderson. I'm 99% sure we won't replace him with anyone. When I look at the team sheet, he's the first name I look for, so to me, he is our most important player. 

I honestly think he's still criminally underrated by people who don't appreciate the extent he helps the team. A lot of people watch the ball during a game, but I tend to watch players and formations of the team as a whole, and the player who always stands out off the ball is Hendo. He is a machine at getting round and into the right areas.

    Manager: Jose Mourinho

Robben was brilliant, an absolute revelation in his first season, however, after his injury at Blackburn that season he was never the same for us. As far as to say a shadow of his former self even, therefore, despite being unbelievable in a short period of time, he didn't have as large an impact as it seemed after his injury. Therefore Mata got the nod for me, we were a one man team whilst Benitez was manager and he was even better than Hazard during his first two seasons (won two consecutive Player of the Season awards). 

Cudicini, Duff, Luiz, Cahill, Azpilicueta, J. Cole, Mikel, Oscar, Malouda, Anelka (probably forgetting a few) could've all made the sub bench as well in my opinion.

Gudjohnsen was unlucky to miss out on the first XI. Brilliant before Abramovich showed up, good throughout the transition period  under Ranieri and great in the title-winning season.

St. Andrews is smaller and in a rural setting. About half of the students live on campus, regardless of year. It is very highly ranked nationally but not as internationally recognizable as Glasgow, perhaps simply because of its size.
If I were you I would check out the University of Edinburgh. Its medicine department is absolutely insane so you might not get in but it is quite prestigious internationally, more so than Glasgow.

Gerrard did it last year with Sturridge when his was struggling when he allow him to take a penalty kick...although I'm sure Gerrard would have taken it in this situation and rightfully so . Overall it's much more important to keep Mario's confidence high since his natural position is to score goals and he is starting to turn the corner (showed it on and off the ball the past two games).   His confidence could potentially pay larger dividend, and you need that especially on a team without a lot of pure goal scorers.  You want your high priced striker to want the ball, and if he didn't then he's not the right guy to play for your team.  I don't blame hendo or sturridge in the heat of the moment  but it's over now so support your teammate and take the ego out of it.

Secondly, his deflection on the Mario question was spot-on, I think. He's protecting his players there, and making sure the pundits don't have anything else to trash Balotelli with. Sure they'll find something, but it'll be grasping at straws now, and frankly Mario's performance today was all around brilliant, which did surprise me, but it certainly doesn't deserve much criticism.

* Over-the-air broadcast digital terrestrial television (DTT). This is currently branded Freeview and as the brand-name implies, is free to receive (other than the TV licence) -- there is no ongoing subscription payment required. Some older TVs can't receive digital signals and need a converter box. There are around 75 channels available on Freeview.

* Non-subscription digital satellite service, which uses the brand name Freesat. A satellite dish and receiver box are required, but there is no ongoing monthly subscription beyond that. It provides a similar set of channels to Freeview, and is primarily intended to bring TV signals to those in remote areas who can't get a reliable DTT signal.

* Subscription digital satellite service -- there is only one national English-language provider of satellite TV in the UK, BSkyB under their brand name Sky. A satellite dish and receiver are required, along with a monthly subscription. There are various levels of subscription available, which buy the subscribers different sets of channels, including sports and movies. A full Sky package is close to 500 channels.

* Subscription digital cable. Again this is a monopoly sevice, with the only provider being Virgin Media. A cable installation and receiver box are required, and a monthly subscription needs to be paid. Similar to satellite there are various levels of subscription available, which buy the subscribers different sets of channels, including sports and movies. A full Virgin package is about 400 channels.

All four providers (Freeview, Freesat, Sky, Virgin) are commercial companies, however the first two are incorporated as not-for-profit entities.

No matter which of these systems you use, either monthly subscription or free, the TV licence must be paid if you ever watch TV as it's being broadcast.",null,0,null,1424415687,null,0,false,0,cor9rcc,null,t3_2why2i,null,t1_cor9rcc,null,t3_2why2i,null,null,null,1424691598,null,26,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,26,null

* **Helmet**, try on a load. All helmets require a SHARP rating, they'll all protect your noggin. Different brands have different fits, designed for different shaped heads. 

The difference in price is fancy stuff, better ventilation, drop-down internal visors, pinlock fitting kits on the visor, chin cloth things, and how quiet they are at speed. 

Buy the size that feels slightly too tight, your head will mold the padding and it'll feel better later. Ask for fitting help when buying.

* **Gloves**, these do not change in size to your hand so best get a pair that *fit like a glove*. You've short gloves and long gauntlet gloves primarily ( these go over your sleeves ). You also have summer and winter gloves, winter gloves you'll be able to feel a significant amount less in the levers but they will keep your fingers from freezing.

In my case, I happen to prefer ladies short summer gloves, I'd suggest being a bit open minded. You can also pick up inner gloves, liners, they come in silk and cotton variants and can allow you to wear summer gloves throughout our winters.

* **Jacket**, the big one here is layers. Expect to spend 100 pounds on a decent textile jacket with an internal removable layer, this internal layer should be waterproof and padded for the winter.

* **Boots**, something waterproof with our weather. You can pick up used boots on Gumtree and eBay for 50 quid, crazy savings over how much they costed originally. Find one that properly protects your ankle, you can confidently purchase any of the big brands here and they'll see you right.

* **Overtrousers**, this is the last one I'd recommend. Simple waterproof over trousers. If you're on a shoestring, these can cost 15-20 quid and you can throw them on when it rains, pull them off and pack them up into something the size of a letter box and cram it into your tail.",null,0,null,1424421669,null,0,false,0,corbdqt,null,t3_2wj1yf,null,t1_corbdqt,null,t3_2wj1yf,null,null,null,1424692366,null,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3,null

I can't remember one egregious shot he took last night and I can't remember any howlers for a while. He's crossing a lot more and taking people on on the outside as opposed to cutting in. His crossing is still pretty shit though.

As for answering your actual questions--I go back and forth nearly every week. Neither of them are fantastic options right now, but I would currently take Lamela. Primarily because I think he can offer us something over the course of a longer period of time and Towsend is fan more effective coming off the bench than Lamela. Lamela's pressing is better than Townsend's and that was crucial against Arsenal. I also think that while he can't terrorize defenses like Townsend did in the first half last night, I can trust him more to pick a killer ball than I can Townsend. He doesn't do it often, but he can.

Overall, I don't think there's much difference in terms of effectiveness. We play differently when either of them are on the pitch--more width and crossing with Townsend and more narrow and control of the ball with Lamela--but I don't think one is working better than the other right now.

null,false,Kitchner,null,null,null,"&gt; I'm not denying that it's a valid argument in favour of anything else. However, I'm not talking about anything else and I'm not compelled to support anything else just because it shares one pro argument.

...

&gt;Here's a couple of examples of things which have one point of similarity in the pros. Despite this one point of similarity, they share other pros which are completely dissimilar from one another and from cannabis, and their cons are likewise completely different. Each issue should be weighed on the sum total of its merits, and not dragged into a discussion of the others as a red herring.

&gt;The amount of taxable revenue is an obvious and quantifiable pro that can be set against any financial cons (such as putative cost to the NHS, which you yourself raised).

Here's the problem though, the positive impact of legalising handguns could well out weigh the cost to the NHS or the Police too, but that vast majority of people would laugh at the idea we should legalise firearms in this country because it would generate more money.

Yes the fact it would generate money does add to the overall picture of what would be considered if it were to become law, but this is a secondary consideration as it's almost implicit. 

For example, you citied earlier that the NHS predicts that £3.5bn a year is spent on treating alcohol related diseases, yet every year about 15 billion (!) pints of beer are sold, about a third of the price in tax. It's predicted that pubs alone contribute about £6bn a year in terms of exercise duty and VAT. 

Since it's implicit it makes no difference either way to the discussion. Even the part that you've stated yourself, that it would offset the costs of the NHS, is based in the fact it's not harmful, which is something I don't think you can say for certain.

The reason I dismiss them as arguments, and insist that they should be applied equally, as often people are arguing why, uniquely, drugs should be legalised. So what they are saying is ""drugs should be legalised, but everything else shouldn't be"". So despite the fact you can legalise say speeding, and it would save police time, raise more money etc, they don't back legalising speeding. So *why* do they not back legalising speeding? Because they believe uniquely that weed does not harm people, which is ultimately what the argument boils down to.

&gt;I've also never contended that my reasons are unbiased, and I've addressed the firearms issue above. I'm merely setting out the pros and cons in as dispassionate a fashion as I can. ""Because I want it to be legal"" is sufficient justification for me, but wouldn't suffice to convince a third party.

But here's the thing though, you don't need to convince someone else if the majority of people agree with you. It's a democracy, if the 51% vote in favour of legalising weed, they don't need to justify it. Same with legalising handguns or anything else in fact.

The bias thing isn't really aimed at you, as you're simply discussing it, but often you see pro-legalisation people on Reddit talk about how it's ""obvious"" that legalisation will solve all the worlds problems, and that anyone who disagrees is an ""idiot"" etc, which is just as unhelpful as people who are anti-legalisation calling everyone who supports it a stoner and saying it has no benefits etc (when it clearly would).

If someone wants to convince me, they need to convince me why legalising weed, uniquely and only weed (or all drugs), should be done in such a fashion that it's objective. If it's objective the arguments can be applied to all laws. 

Yes you gain financial benefits etc from legalisation, but we shouldn't be legalising BECAUSE of those things, because the moment they move from a ""consequence of something we already decided to do because it's right"" to ""the reason we are doing it"" you need to consider other currently criminal activities using the same arguments, otherwise you are hypocritical and inconsistent.

&gt;The other examples you've raised: the illegal parking, punching your boss, failing to pay your rent. In each case, you've first infringed on somebody else's rights.

See, here you need to be careful, because essentially what you're saying is if someone infringes your rights first, it's ok to infringe theirs regardless of context. If I own a house that I rent to you I can't just kick you out, I need to give you notice to move out of it by law. This is infringing my rights to do what I like with private property in order to protect your right not to be made homeless over night. By your logic if anyone breaks the terms of their tenancy agreement, I should just be able to kick them out straight away.

We decide that some rights are more important than others all the time, and we restrict rights all the time according to that. Ultimately if that's your opinion then that's your opinion. I could talk about freedoms and rights of society for hours, but not everyone is idealistically libertarian in their approach to the role of government, and if your goal is genuinely to convince them to support legalisation, you can't approach it from a libertarian stand point.

null,false,ScaredOfAPotato,UnionFlag,"E. Midlands. R6, XS250",null,"In a sort of loose order of importance:

* **Helmet:**  You only get one head.  As /u/G-A says, cheaper lids should be bought slightly too tight as the interiors quickly give out and soften, but premium lids should fit bang on the day you buy them, as they don't wear in like cheap ones.

* **Boots:** In the event of an accident the bike will probably land on your leg/ankles.  This is a no-brainer.  A nice pair of gore-tex boots will cost you, but breathable waterproof boots are a magnificent thing.  A pair of basic Black Rains (waterproof but not breathable) can be had for £100 or so.  I tested a pair in an off and they work with a bike pressing them into the tarmac at 70mph.

* **Trousers:** Again, there's a bike on your legs at 70mph.  You do the maths.  Armoured leather or textile as a minimum.  I have a scraped knee armour piece that proves this works!!!

* **Gloves:** You'll put your hand down in the accident mentioned above.  Hands are useful.  NEVER ride without gloves.  Avoid the £20 bargain bin gloves as the stitching will fail in an accident.  Go for a brand.  Decent starter brands are Spada or RST.

* **Jacket:**  The last thing in the above accident is when your elbow and shoulder touches down, so armour in those places is essential.  The jacket is primarily weather protection day to day, however, so removable lining and waterproofing can be really helpful.  Don't forget to reapply Nikwax or similar to keep the waterporoofing.  The jacket MUST zip to your trousers.  The cold gets in otherwise, as well as it separating and exposing delicate flesh if you fall off.

* **Earplugs:**  Huge amount of hearing damage if you ride fast &amp; often without earplugs.  People say they prefer to hear what's going on, or they need to hear cars and sirens; newsflash - you still can with earplugs on.  They just attenuate the low frequency wind noise that has been repeatedly proven to permanently damage your hearing.  Forever.  As you get more serious or more wealthy, opt for properly moulded ones as they're just zero hassle - my last pair did about 5 years, so they're probably cheaper than disposables long-term...

* **Base Layers:**  These wick away moisture in summer and trap heat in winter.  A lot of people wear a cotton t-shirt or whatever, but those people are missing a trick - this shit works!

* **Back Protector:**  A lot of riders don't wear these, opting for a foam insert in a jacket (or nothing).  I like them because they keep your back warm in winter and stop you breaking your spine if you do fall off.  They also look cool as fuck if you ask me.  I wear a Forcefield L2K Evo.  It moulds to my hunchback as it warms up and genuinely doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything.

* **Snoods/Balaclavas:**  A snood (neck tube/buff) will keep the wind out of your collar.  At this time of year I ride with two on.  I also use a balaclava year round to keep my lid fresh - it also helps you stay warm in winter.

Gearing up for biking is expensive, unfortunately, but the first time you slide down the road with a bike on you at 70+ mph and walk away, it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's worth every penny.  If you can't afford the gear, you can't afford to ride.

Leathers are cooler in summer, but also colder in winter.  Textiles typically extend the season, but in the height of summer may be warmer.  Opt for a set with vents and liners that come out and you'll be far more comfortable in summer.  You probably want two sets of gloves - winter and summer.

I don't recommend that approach.

In order of importance: Helmet, gloves, boots, jacket, trousers. Obviously head damage is the worst, but damage to your wrists, hands, feet and ankles can be crippling and irreparable. Ideally, you want boots that brace the ankle, putting the strain in an accident on your shin bones. Gloves are trickier, but anything that webs the pinky and ring fingers together will do a lot to reduce breakages in that area. Alpinestars pioneered that, I think, but they tend to be quite pricey.

Jacket and trousers are less important; they'll mostly protect you from road rash, which is well worth avoiding but less permanent. Armour on your joints is more important; again, hard to repair and more likely to cause long-term problems if you don't protect 'em. 

What others have said about heat is true. Moisture-wicking base layers will help with sweat, if you get the good stuff. Generally speaking, textile gear will keep you more comfortable in terms of weather all year round; it's relatively breathable, so sweat won't build up, but is more windproof than leather, especially because they often come with a warm removable liner, which leather doesn't often have.

I'd argue the reason the BBC radio stations are so popular is because they have the best DJs, the best content, and provide the best innovations (like online streaming etc). I mean anyone who claims that the entire private sector can't compete with a public sector broadcaster who has kept the same radio stations and largely the same format for so long is undermining the idea that the private sector is innovative!

*: Your sturdy boots and thick jacket will do shit all in a crash but they will keep you relatively comfortable riding around. Plan to crash.

Obviously buy a helmet. Definitely buy gloves, wind chill is a real thing and your hands are very exposed on a motorbike. If you crash without gloves you'll get up without hands. Get a jacket for similar reasons, you'll freeze without one and even in the summer, taking a bee to the nipple at 40mph is no joke. Plus if you crash that's a lot of skin to lose. 

Personally I rode for around 6 months with hiking boots and jeans on my lowers, but I wouldn't recommend that now. It's ok for riding but as I said, boots that aren't specifically for motorcycling won't do anything in an accident. Ankles don't ever really heal once they've been smashed to bits. I would place boots on equal footing (ha) with a jacket.

Trousers I think are the least important. Even armoured ones won't really protect your knees in an impact (although I still recommend them!) and if I was going to get road rash anywhere I'd want it on my organ-free legs. They tend to be pretty expensive as well, so if money is tight you're better off getting quality everything else and taking the chance on your legs. Kevlar jeans are getting cheap now if you've got some cash left over.

As for summer, the short answer is to buy two sets of gear, one bulky for winter and one light for summer. Your helmet should be year-round, obviously. Honestly for gloves I'd buy a thermal pair now and be ready to spend another £50 on light ones six months from now, there's no getting round that really. For your jacket you could get the ""4 seasons"" stuff although that really means spring and autumn. Get one with vents to open in the summer and get it big enough to fit a jumper underneath in winter. It's never going to be as comfy as a car but you shouldn't be sweating in it, not in Britain. Similarly for your legs if you get proper trousers, get ones with some vents and get them big enough to fit some cheapo thermal clothes underneath. Don't get leathers if you want to be comfortable.

The first plan was always for Hendo to take it. But when it's so late in the game and the margin for error is so little then you want the most experienced one to take it. When the ref gave the penalty, I instantly thought it's gonna be Balotelli. Why? Because he is the only one who has taken penalties. A missed penalty is much worse for Henderson's confidence than giving the pen to Mario. Having a plan to start with is great but reacting to situations is better than stubbornly clinging on to the plan. 

I remember that Rafa decided the penalty taker before the game. And if the player missed, he'd get the blame. That's how he defended his players, but it always seemed a bit strange. I'd say that the most confident taker will get it if we don't have a designated taker, currently we don't. It's not like the situation is similar to Mirallas and Baines. In that situation Mirallas just grabbed the ball from a designated penalty-taker while he himself isn't very experienced at penalties. A similar situation would be when Sturridge grabs the ball from Gerrard, but that just wouldn't happen in Liverpool. 

Also, I'd say that it wasn't that selfish. It could've been a trust issue - meaning that Balotelli didn't trust Henderson to take it. He wanted to take the high pressure situation from Henderson. Maybe doesn't seem like it but he just wanted that ball to end up in the back of the net for the good of the club not himself. They'll talk it out. It isn't some big issue.

Is there no redemption for him in that act alone? He quickly realised Hendo was el Capitan and Hendo then had the ball which he gave to Balotelli for the PK.

&gt;Skunk #1 is a hybrid strain that has influenced cannabis on a global scale, parenting a horde of Skunk crosses since it first bloomed in ‘85. Sensi Seeds, who were called The Seed Bank at this time, bred Skunk #1 using diverse genetics from around the world. Central and South American, Afghani, and Thai varieties converged through an intricate selective breeding process that spanned several generations. Finally, the genetic cornerstone of countless cannabis hybrids was born. 

Some notable hybrids are:

•Lemon Haze

•Silver Haze

•Amnesia Haze

•Bloodskunque

•Deathskünk

•Digby Generic

•Early Pearl/Skunk #1 x Northern Lights #5/Haze - 2nd High Times Cannabis Cup (1989)

•Ham &amp; Cheese and Ramen

•Haze x Skunk #1 - 5th High Times Cannabis Cup (1992)

•Island Sweet Skunk

•Orange bud

•Skunk #0 / Prime Skunk / Ur-skunk / Original Skunk / The Eden Strain

•Skunk #1 - 1st High Times Cannabis Cup (1988)

•Jack Herer is a cross between Skunk #1, Haze, and Northern Lights #5.

•Northern Lights #7

•Skunk - 4th High Times Cannabis Cup (1991)

•Skunk #9

•Skunk #11 


TLDR:  Almost all of the msot common types of weed sold today are a variety of one form or another of Skunk #1.  It has become so prevalent in the UK scene that most kids these days just associate skunk with weed.

To that end, I would speak to the guys at [ACAS](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1577) who are employment specialists and can advise you properly on the actual legal position.

Indeed. And even more so if we don't stop using so much fossil fuels.

&gt; As others have pointed out, the grid uses non renewable fuelled power stations to handle the rapid change currently. But what happens when we increase our reliance weather affected power generation.

What happens is renewables in other areas take up the slack. What we really need is a Europe wide grid. We sell excess wind electricity to Southern Europe, they sell excess solar to us.
We also need more storage and a smart grid.

That's the whole point. You don't know what you're talking about.

Ukraine's population has (on the whole) been trying to pivot towards Europe and away from Russia for a generation or more (remember the orange revolution?). They see the success of Poland etc and want it too. This is especially true of the western side of Ukraine, but there are plenty of people in eastern Ukraine who wanted to join Europe too.

Regardless if some eastern Ukrainians weren't keen, Ukraine is one country so if the majority of its citizens want something, it should happen. Russia has for years been doing everything it can politically/economically (propaganda, economic deals with special clauses etc) to stop Ukraine signing an association agreement with the EU, but signing the agreement eventually became such a strong political issue it lead to the Maiden movement. It has become impossible for Russia to stop them signing through economic/political means, and so they have moved to the next step: Destablising the country through military conflict, therefore stopping it from joining either the EU or NATO.

What they've done is rounded up as many Russian sympathisers as possible, trained them, armed them, and backed them up with Russian special forces, Anti-Aircraft guns, tanks, you name it. There is no way that the Russian sympathisers are numerous enough, well trained enough nor well enough armed enough to take on the Ukrainian army for any length of time by themselves. As I say, they also wouldn't have been numerous enough to make an impact politically, hence the need for the war.

It is the equivalent of the UK voting to leave the EU, and a few Scots being so mad about it they decide to start a war in Scotland for secession from the UK, with Russia providing them with the arms, soldiers, tanks etc. Of course, this couldn't happen here because we would fucking annihilate the ""Scottish Rebels"" in hours. But if we get rid of our army, what is there to stop Russia doing this? The only reason they can do it in Ukraine is because they are militarily weak.

It's also worth noting the reason why the Russian political elite are so afraid of Ukraine joining the EU: Once Ukrainian living standards are rising and corruption is falling (as has happened everywhere else), what do you think the Russian population will make of that?",null,0,null,1424433226,null,0,false,0,cordsns,null,t3_2wezoz,null,t1_cordsns,null,t1_coqeuul,null,null,null,1424693492,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Just stand up and make them work to beat you or play the ball past you.

The only time this advice doesn't apply is if the opponent is in a dangerous position close to your goal. Obviously you can't give them space then as they'll have a free shot.

A few decades ago, the communist regime of Ceausescu was highly nationalistic. He attempted to associate modern Romania with the ancient Roman empire, making Romania feel more important due to ancient glory. I guess echos of that still linger and this is what the OP is referring to.

If a similar nationalistic regime (UKIP?) came to power in the UK, they would likely push a similar angle, making sure schools educated pupils about the glories of Imperial Britain. A few years later these boards would be full of people regurgitating the ""facts"" taught to them.

Personally, I believe that Britain achieved many great things in the past, with perhaps the greatest being the immense progress we made in the sciences, and abolition of slavery.

[Foreign policy: unravelling](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=85160)

&gt;*From the heady days when Blair had the world at his feet, with his doctrine of humanitarian interventionalism, we now seem to be having a few problems.  In fact, nothing any more seems to be going right.*

If the full reports really interest you these cover those bases:-

[HOUSE OF LORDS European Union Committee 6th Report of Session 2014 – 15 The EU and Russia: before and beyond the crisis in Ukraine](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldselect/ldeucom/115/115.pdf)

And here's the general report on the FCO to combine with the above present conclusions from Ukraine/Russia/EU/UK:-

[Foreign And Commonwealth Office: Annual Report and Accounts 2013–14](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/325896/FCO_Annual_Report_2013-14.pdf)

Summary of William Hague's introduction by Dr. RAE North from the above report:-

&gt;*Hague's introduction, rather sets the tone. ""We will work to resolve the crisis in Ukraine and to press Russia to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of her neighbours"", he writes, then adding: ""We will press on with our efforts, with key allies, to bring about an end to the conflict in Syria and help end the appalling suffering of the Syrian people"".*

&gt;*Interestingly, those issues are getting inexorably linked, but in UK terms we have nothing but failure to report. Perhaps this is because the Ukraine policy is primarily determined by the EU, and we are committed to advancing the British national interest ""through an effective EU policy in priority areas, engaging constructively while protecting our national sovereignty"".*

&gt;*Apart from the incompatibility of protecting our national sovereignty by advancing the British interest through the EU, the very fact that we are so much reliant on the EU may partly explain our lacklustre performance. This, though, can only be a partial explanation. Much of our failure has to be home grown.

If you want to switch to a mobile plan instead of a broadband plan for home Internet, there are better ways to do it than to use your phone. 

You can get a 4G router and then get a house antenna that you would mount to your house like an Ariel to get the best speeds and signal. You should then probably use a VPN on the router if it supports it to hide that your using a mobile plan for broadband (they usually don't like people doing that) 

I believe you can get cheap unlimited 4G plans from Three, just hope you get signal where you are. They usually come with a limited amount of tethering/hotspot allowance but the VPN thing I mentioned earlier bypasses that limit.

However, thinking about it now - gaming probably wouldn't work well on 4G due to pings.

&gt; The idea is to invite the gentleman ""Souleymane S"" &amp; his wife &amp; children to come to London for a weekend to find out what the club &amp; it's fans are really like. We would pay their train fares, hotel accommodation &amp; invite them to a game. They would also get the chance to meet some of our fans &amp; some of our players.. Paul Cannoville has already agreed to join in. This is not a publicity stunt orchestrated by the club. It is the idea of just one ordinary fan. I would like to raise £2000... Which is roughly £1 for every Chelsea fan who was in Paris for the match.
  Should the invitation be rejected, or excess funds raised, the money will go to The Chelsea Foundation for use in community projects.

Those are the crimes she would be guilty of, however the chances of a prosecution would probably depend on what the result of this fraud was. You say it was done ""to pass her placements, and for her to pass her college course"" so it does look like she has *benefited* from this, which is one of the tests for a fraud prosecution.

What is more likely to happen is that either the college would discover it themselves, or if someone whose signature was forged discovers this has happened and raises hell as a result. This would expose the college and your girlfriend to civil liabilities in this respect, as well as the risk the victim may try to involve the police.

The chances of a criminal prosecution are slim, but the chances of the college expelling her remain a distinct possibility. 

Another issue to consider is what if she gets a job based on the qualification that is based on fraud? If this is discovered at some point in the future, she could also lose whatever job she has at that time. 

Even if the job didn't rely on the qualification, they might simply argue that she knowingly lied on her application form (by including a qualification she knew she didn't really have as it was based on fraud) and dismiss her for gross misconduct.

EDIT: As for the likely punishments, these are sentencing guidelines for [fraud](http://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/publications/item/fraud-bribery-and-money-laundering-offences-definitive-guideline/); and forgery could be considered under two separate charges - [making a false instrument](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/making_a_false_instrument/) and [using a false instrument](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/using_a_false_instrument/).

I have a kid in year 10 which means she's in the first year where school is mandatory until 18, so GCSE's seem to be reduced to not much more than a test to mark the end of KS4.

My advice would be to get as many A/A* as possible, but focus on honing your revision technique and understanding the importance of deadlines rather than worrying about the content of the subjects. If things are in any way similar to the A levels I took 20+ years ago, what you learned in GCSE's is pretty much treated with contempt at A level.

What your school is actually trying to teach you are the life lessons you'll need to excel in life - fact retention, critical thinking, the worth of private study and the skills to effectively find things out for yourself.

Then Schneiderlin vs Henderson is a bit more difficult, I think it's a bit more of a toss up on how you want to play, Schneiderlin provides a bit of extra cover, Henderson gets forward a bit more. I might go for Henderson because I think Wanyama can be a wall on his own and Henderson has an engine that might be even bigger than Schneiderlin's. 

Sterling and Coutinho are basically given, the form Lallana and our own AM's are in isn't quite good enough compared to those, however Mane is still a huge threat at present and can't be ignored. Him + Sterling on the wings would be terrifying.  

Sturridge is great, and with those attacking midfielders he'd cause all sorts of trouble, defenders not knowing who to follow with the movement, speed and creativity. He's the type of striker I want Saints to have, and the one we need if we want to seriously contend at the top (Sorry Pelle, you have better hair though).  

So really mine would be the same but with Henderson instead, and only because of the team dynamic I'd want.

(As if militant nationalism -and inherent racism- is not essential part of Ukip, Le Penn's party, or the Tea Party. But let's pretend.) Your argument about nationalism somehow makes the Roma angle irrelevant, by the way.

The issue is that NO amount of patriotism or nationalism are tolerated in Hungary. At all. I've been living in the US and UK since 2002, and the amount of outright nationalist shit still makes me uncomfortable, because I'm not used to it. (Especially the US.) If you even tried a fraction of that in Hungary, you'd be labelled an anti-Semite, a fascist, a Jobbik supporter. Because -strangely enough- what Jobbik says is quite in line with the Republican rhetoric. This is the fucked up part. And people DO have an affection to it, because the official narrative is not really encouraging for this whole ""be proud of your heritage, your country"" thing. and let me tell you: Hungarians do persecuted -especially because of the expats' woes over the different borders.  The reason for this is -again- multi-faceted. They don't want to ruffle the neighboring countries' sensitivities, which, after WWI ended up with 3 million ethnic Hungarians inside their borders, and can interpret this as an attempt to redraw the borders. (Many of these countries did their best to decrease this number, by the way, but it is a different conversation.) They do feel alone surrounded by hostile countries. (Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, Croatia all had and some cases still has serious anti-Hungarian rhetoric -and sometimes policies in place. Just look up the Benes Decrees. The other is the Horthy era (a big anathema to the ruling communists back in the days), and the Holocaust. Any sort of expression of patriotism or nationalism (the two are not the same) is still interpreted as an attempt to legitimize the Horthy era -or worse- the Szalasi government. Which might or might not be true; most of the times it is not. But the Jobbik is enjoying the blowback from this. It taps into the fears, the resentment about the economy, about the corrupt politicians, about the feeling of persecution (which by now is mostly imagined). Like it or not, Hungary is a predominantly conservative country (I personally don't like it much), and the quasi-liberal narrative that is dominating the media and political discourse is just not fitting with most of the population. (I have serious beef with the so-called liberal elite there, hence the quasi-liberal label.) And some of these people will turn to Jobbik because of this.

If we sure up the back with a squad player or two (Wisdom though is a great shout) get that world-class Gerrard replacement, then I think we'll have one of the best all round squads in the league. Then is the real test of the players and of course Brendan in bringing the best out of it.

Actually, almost no one apart from EU citizens is let in. Visa restrictions have become draconian and it is nearly impossible to get a residence permit if you are not a rich investor or an excellent professional.

With the EU, that 'no borders and a common labour market' thing is one of its major foundations. It can be argued if that was a good idea to include that many poorer members (although Greece is one of the oldest members, so this isn't a strict rule), but it is simply impossible to 'close the borders' without leaving the EU or amending its core rules (together with other members).

the fact there are people on here, slating an ex chelsea player (bridge) just to defend his captain who fucked his ex/mother of his kids..bla bla bla (who cares)..and then pointing to Giggs to excuse what Terry did, is exactly why football fans as a collective are considered fucking moronic.

Luis Suarez similarly, seemed to go one further and redeem himself from being a racist AND A CANNIBAL simply through scoring buckets of goals and being the best player in the league! two things which have nothing to do with eachother, yet every worldclass performance by suarez last season was followed by the mainstream pundits talking about he had cleaned up his act. there are very few fans who are exempt from this hypocrisy. Arsenal fans immediately began chanting the Van Persie rapist song after he left the club, despite having no problem with it before.

Ask anyone from one of our former colonies why we're ashamed of that. Research the partition of India, for one example. We slaughtered great numbers of people in the name of ""civilization"" and then we abandoned a lot of the colonies to their own devices once we'd decided we should stop intervening.

They enter out into tight streets at rush hour. So (2) is **not travel in the four busiest hours of the day**. If the haulage industry won't agree to that we should force it onto them.

There was an article in the recent CTC magazine asking the drivers what would make the biggest difference to them. They said that extra mirrors and blind-spot cameras were useful though rely on active driver use: a negligent driver is still going to cause an accident here. They said proximity alarms were totally useless: reversing alarms, car alarms and every other noise on the street is already ignored by everyone.

This is finally a subject I can talk about since my other half is Norwegian, so I've spent a fair amount of time in Mandal/Kristiansand/ other parts of Vest Agder.

First of all, you're probably going to benefit by checking in with the [ANSA \(Norwegian Students Abroad\) chapter for the UK.](http://www.ansa.no/studier-i-utlandet/under/ansa-i-utlandet/ansaland-uk/) They should be able to help you with getting settled and the odd friendly face.

Each 17th of May, [the Norwegian Seamen's Church in London](http://sjomannskirken.no/london/) near Southwark Park throw a big event for the day - a good couple of thousand Norwegians show up each year so thats something to look forward to.

Apart from that, you should find everything is pretty similar here to Norway - although from my experience most people in Norway have a far better standard of living than a lot of people in the UK. You might find it quite a culture shock - although the cost of going out for a meal here is *A LOT* lower so that might be a pleasant surprise.

- IF you're a fan of lakris, stock up before you come here as the most youre likely to get is licquorice allsorts.

- Depending on the school you go to, you might or might not be expected to wear a uniform.

- As to workouts to get more cut, the absolute best workout you can do to lose body fat the quickest and get cut is sprints, which falls under HIIT or high intensity interval training. These workouts may not burn as many calories as say hour long cardio sessions during that length of time in which you're working out (60 min vs 15 min) but the sprinting has more of an after burn effect and your metabolism and rate of burning calories is increased for something like 48 hours compared to long slow cardio that doesnt have the afterburn effect anywhere near HIIT, so you'll burn more throughout the day from High intensity interval training. Long vs short cardio debate depends on your goal. As you said you want more cut so the absolute best advice I could give is sprints. 

- this link is a great article you can read on HIIT and as you scroll down you can see a beginners to intermediate to advanced guide on how long to do sprints and then how long to rest. 

http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/ultimate-8-week-hiit-for-fat-burning-program.html


-  as the article says it can be any exercise (I just think personally sprints burn fat like a hot grill burns meat lol) so yeah whatever you choose during your ""high intensity"" interval part give it 100%! 


- Sorry for the long post but good luck and I hope this was helpful, PM me anything for any other workout tips or questions!

Edit: it's 6 am here, if I don't spell stuff correctly sorry! And my phone is on autocorrect lol!

- Also look up ""tabata workouts"" you can do those to get cut as well they're a crazy way of doing high interval training, it's pretty much 20 seconds as hard as you can then 10 seconds rest, repeat for like 6-12 minutes.

That really doesn't work - imagine telling Norwich, who could sell out Carrow Road twice over most weeks, to charge the same as Wigan, who have ~10,000 empty seats every Saturday.

Russia did not let Ireland or France become independent nor are they neighbours.

Ukraine agreed to get rid of nukes and Russia promised not to invade.  They lied too.

Do some reading:

""Current relations
Despite consistently being at odds, in December 2009 NATO approached Russia for help in Afghanistan, requesting permission for the alliance to fly cargo (including possibly military ones) over Russian territory to Afghanistan, and to provide more helicopters for the Afghan armed forces.[27] Russia has so far denied these requests, although it has continued to allow transit of non-military supplies through its territory.[28]

In April 2009, the Polish Foreign Minister, Radosław Sikorski, suggested including Russia in NATO.[29] In March 2010 this suggestion was repeated in an open letter co-written by German defense experts General Klaus Naumann, Frank Elbe, Ulrich Weisser, and former German Defense Minister Volker Rühe. In the letter it was suggested that Russia was needed in the wake of an emerging multi-polar world in order for NATO to counterbalance emerging Asian powers.[30]

However current Russian leadership has made it clear that Russia does not plan to join the alliance, preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level now. The Russian envoy to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, is quoted as saying ""Great powers don't join coalitions, they create coalitions. Russia considers itself a great power,"" although he said that Russia did not rule out membership at some point in the future.[13] In March 2000 president Vladimir Putin, in interview to British television said Russia could once join NATO.[31]

On 6 June 2011, NATO and Russia participated in their first ever joint fighter jet exercise, dubbed ""Vigilant Skies 2011"". Since the Cold War, this is only the second joint military venture between the alliance and Russia, with the first being a joint submarine exercise which begun on 30 May 2011.[32]

In April 2012 there were some protests in Russia over their country's involvement with NATO, mostly made up of Ultranationalist and Pro Leftist groups.[33]

Reuters reported in February 2014 that Russia and NATO were drawing up plans to jointly guard the MV Cape Ray as it is used to dismantle Syrian chemical weapons.[34]

In the beginning of March 2014, tensions began flaring between NATO and Russia as Russian troops moved into Crimea to annex the territory that they claim is historically Russian. NATO condemned Russia's actions as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.[35] Co-operation with Russia was suspended on 1 April 2014.[36]""",null,0,null,1424444231,null,0,false,0,corhm4m,null,t3_2wj976,null,t1_corhm4m,null,t1_corh4pu,null,null,null,1424695274,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

&gt;The west promised not to allow E. Europe becoming part of NATO.

&gt;Long story short it was not a legal/written agreement.

lel.

&gt;Here is a good link to read. It discusses the agreement for NATO to not expand. Long story short it was not a legal/written agreement.

I just gave you that exact link! A quote from the page:

""Some statements of Western politicians – particularly German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher and his American counterpart James A. Baker – can indeed be interpreted as a general rejection of any NATO enlargement beyond East Germany. However, these statements were made in the context of the negotiations on German reunification, and the Soviet interlocutors never specified their concerns. In the crucial “2+4” negotiations, which finally led Gorbachev to accept a unified Germany in NATO in July 1990, the issue was never raised. As former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze later put it, the idea of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact dissolving and NATO taking in former Warsaw Pact members was beyond the imagination of the protagonists at the time.

Yet even if one were to assume that Genscher and others had indeed sought to forestall NATO’s future enlargement with a view to respecting Soviet security interests, they could never have done so. The dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 later created a completely new situation, as the countries of Central and Eastern Europe were finally able to assert their sovereignty and define their own foreign and security policy goals. As these goals centered on integration with the West, any categorical refusal of NATO to respond would have meant the de facto continuation of Europe’s division along former Cold War lines. The right to choose one’s alliance, enshrined in the 1975 Helsinki Charter, would have been denied – an approach that the West could never have sustained, neither politically nor morally.""

&gt;The point remains that they had a large army then and could have used force to keep the countries but chose not too (thankfully!).

Wrong, totally wrong. Russia was bankrupt. It could not afford to maintain its army to the level required any more, and had to accept that it needed to let go of the ex-warsaw countries.

Just one of a million articles I could link to prove my point.

&gt;The source you shared clearly shows why they will not join NATO, what I was saying all along - thanks for proving my point.

No, the source I stated shows that efforts were made by both the Germans and the Polish to include Russia in NATO. They responded with """"Great powers don't join coalitions, they create coalitions.

The issue is whether, and to what extent, you can *penalise* people for parking without permission.

As an example many supermarkets offer 2 hours free parking and then attempt to ""fine"" anyone overstaying (""fine"" in inverted commas because in law it's not a real fine).

Private parking charges are covered by basic contract law.  Overstaying is a breach of contract.  If someone breaches a contract they are liable to pay damages.  However it is pretty well established in general that damages have to reflect the actual harm arising from the breach of contract.  Penalty clauses (i.e. levying a flat charge in response to a breach) are generally unlawful and unenforcable.

The argument is that in many cases overstaying in a private car park is breach of contract, and the flat fees that the parking companies attempt to charge are unlawful penalties rather than either legitimate charges or genuine damages.",null,0,null,1424445741,null,0,false,0,corids1,null,t3_2wj5nx,null,t1_corids1,null,t1_corhetj,null,null,null,1424695702,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Football is a culture. And at a club like LFC, the decision of the captain is huge. It doesn't matter that it went in or that Ballo had the better penalty record. Rodgers determined who was taking pens before the game and Henderson was there to enforce that. Not wanting to make a scene in the final minutes of the game, he backed down. That still doesn't mean Balotelli was right. 

I don't know what his future is. I just know that under a manager like Shanks, or Kenny or Rafa,... That level of disrespect to his captain, manager and club would have been a death sentence.

There is no obligation upon me to maximise the amount of tax that I pay and if I can reduce my tax liabilities by making use of an ISA, paying into a pension or by structuring my financial affairs to reduce my exposure then that's perfectly fair.

If I were to outright lie on my tax return and claim to have only earned £30,000 last year when I in fact earned £80,000 then I would have evaded a significant amount of Income Tax and National Insurance and committed a very serious crime by under reporting my income.

If I were to incorporate as a limited company and then structure that £80,000 to recognise income as part PAYE and part dividend, then my tax exposure would be very different as a result and I could pay less tax quite legally.

i would love enrique for another season, but if we have the opportunity to move him on, i think fsg will. glen should leave, he has been a fantastic servant of the club, but his time is finally here.

1. loan origi again to a prem team

That excuse doesn't work in this situation. Here is the pledge signed by all Liberal Democrat MP's including Nick Clegg, just incase you forgot:

Simple and achieveable. Something you would think the 3rd largest party could easily stick to. Even a party with just 1 MP could stick with that pledge. No majority needed. 

Personally I find the new system more progressive. The fees may be higher, but the repayment terms were much better. But I won't criticise those who voted based on that one issue, and are angry at the them for going back on their word. Maybe in the future they'll be more careful about what they pledge.

Train full hyped or drunk Chelsea fans, packed Metro.

Guy tries to get on at the worst possible spot. Chelsea fans (British assumably) being dicks to a Frenchman because the whole metro was full of fans. A guy who didn't know the game was going on was pissed when confronted by rowdy fans.

The doors wouldn't shut presumably because it was so full and Souleymane could have easily walked down to a different door.  Decides to get aggressive with the Chelsea supporters despite them showing no signs of being courteous. He says something offensive to the people after being confronted, assumably about them not letting him on because of his color or nationality or something.

They take his accusation as a reason to do their stupid chant and be douches about letting him on the metro.

The income of newspapers all over the world has declined and thus, so has the quality of journalism. A film called *Page One: Inside the New York Times* gives a very good overview of the issues the press faced as adoption of the Internet rose.

There are plenty of newspapers that have considered leaving their print versions completely because they're just dead weight. All that's really keeping them alive is that advertisers pay a lot more for print adverts and advertorials than web ones. 

Also, another key factor is how much PR you're reading in papers these days. There are currently 4 PRs in this country to every journalist. Most of what you read in the news is a rehashed press release or a piece that was taken directly from another paper.

&gt;

&gt;The __STAR__ (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format is a [job interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_interview) technique used by interviewers to gather all the relevant information about a specific capability that the job requires. This interview format is said [*[by whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions)*] to have a higher degree of predictability of future on-the-job performance than the traditional interview. This technique is a behavioral interview technique.

&gt;


&gt;* Situation: The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation in which you found yourself.

&gt;* Task: What did you have to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation.

&gt;* Action: What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it and what the alternatives were.

&gt;* Results: What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your objectives? What did you learn from this experience and have you used this learning since?

&gt;The STAR technique is similar to the [SOARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOARA) technique.

And it has the flexibility to drop into a 5-4-1 with the attacking mids defending the wide areas as we did at times last night.

This is more of a standard 3-5-2 and we would have to be more direct, while the wingbacks might not get so much space to move forward into.
