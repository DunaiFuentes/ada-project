null,false,TheBigBlaszczykowski,null,null,null,"Ramires is not a #10 and never has been at the professional level.  
The most attacking natured Center Midfielder in a side is classically a #8 while the more defensive midfielder was often #6. The #10 role is more of a deep lying forward type role, however, in modern football, we do often associate the #10's with the midfield.

A Counter attack minded CM like Ramires is not a #10.   
In a 4231, Ramires would always be part of the 2 man midfield, used for his closing down, insane engine, and aggression. In a true 433, he may very well be the most attacking of the 3 man midfield (depends who else is playing) and regarded as an attacking central midfielder, but a 433 doesn't have a player designated to playing in the hole in the #10 role. Any number of the midfield 3 takes turns attacking this space. This is what Lampard did for us for years when we played that way. You wouldn't of said Lampard played as a #10, he was playing as a #8 and also wore it on his back.

So you're claims that he's an ""attacking central midfielder"" are somewhat correct as he is quite good at going forward on the counter attack and he is a central midfielder, but his ability to break through the lines and chip in the odd goal do not in anyway make him a #10.

Ramires is a CM with a knack for counter attacking. A variety of skill sets can be utilized in the center midfield position but those with a big engine and the ability to get up and down the pitch have often been called box to box midfielders. Ramires is a box to box midfielder, though he is an example with very little technique, vision, or ability to play a weighted pass, but he is very fast and has a third lung, so he can both spring forward on a counter attack and also close down quickly when we are not in possession.

Also, bringing up his size is absolutely stupid. By that logic, you'd have to define Verrati and Xavi as #10's who played out of position their whole careers. What about Besic? He's shorter than Ramires. Is he a #10 now too? 
None of those players are bigger than ramires AND they can actually string a pass together, yet they are not regarded #10's.",null,0,null,1438145429,null,0,1438147401,0,ctjx9yn,null,t3_3ez5vk,null,t1_ctjx9yn,null,t3_3ez5vk,null,null,null,1440150494,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

Sky, BT et al. *generally* tend to be the way to go in terms of upload speed and bandwidth for gaming though. Also, they don't *tend* to cap these days.

Cable is a different beast; on the whole faster downloads, as much as you like, and best of all you don't *necessarily* need a phone line to enjoy their internet service (remember when you're looking at prices, BT, Sky, Plus Net and what have you tend to advertise that all important line rental in brackets and small lettering *outside* of that great big text crowing about how cheap their package is) - the problem is, however, there are still caps. The upload is a bit crappy on Virgin for example (I pay for the 152mb service, get 10mb upload), and they *do* cap the upload for some bizarre reason, while leaving the download completely untouched.

Why? Who knows. In the age of fibre, you'd have thought that ""faster than light"" internet would also bring with it a truly *free* internet, but in the UK, this is most assuredly not the case sadly, when most of europe is pointing and laughing at us through their gigabit services. You should be aware, by the way, that in the UK, we get shafted for *everything* when it comes to technology - just a friendly warning. If you want cheaper hardware, look towards your family or the EU to help you out.

In closing, ask yourself if you're a competitive gamer; if you play battlefield or anything of that ilk, I would say that BT would be a better option; either will be perfectly serviceable for streaming services though.

Crappy local teams or big teams - the purpose of the preseason is really like everyone else has said - to provide a low-stakes competitive setting in which players (re)gain fitness and rapport, and coaches/managers get to test scenarios - players out of position, different formations, etc. 

How we perform during pre-season has incredibly little to do with our season. Man Utd. had an incredible pre-season last summer, they looked sharp and dynamic. Yet for the start and I'd say roughly 60% of the season, they failed to find that same dynamic passing movement. Similarly, our preseason schedule and form over the last couple of seasons has about fuck all to do with our season. 


I think the most critical things about this summer and the pre-season are: 

*  Most of the signings we made were to fill specific holes, and those new players can be realistically assessed in their positions during preseason (Clyne, Millner, Bogdan etc) 

* No World Cup meaning our international players are returning with fresher legs than last year

* New coaching staff in place early on, with a full pre-season to work on new training/coaching practices. (Esp. excited about Gary Mac) 

One last point ot make about pre-season is that as much as the results don't count, individual standout performances - though very encouraging (Gomez' form has earned him the right to battle for first team instaed of being loaned out) should be seen in a moderate light, without the immediate expectation that that run of form continues into the regular season.

I understand the logic but I don't really agree with it. In my mind, there was *so* much riding on that game for Warburton that failure would have been viewed as not an option. It's not the prestige of the cup but that's relevant but the fact that Warburton would have considered the game a must win.

The guy acts in the press like he had nothing to do with the Scott Allan bids, but imo that's absolute crud. He's pulling the strings, using all his contacts and experience to build a squad and gain a competitive advantage, and that no doubt includes knocking the linchpin out of Hibs' midfield a couple of days before his team's competative debut.

I doubt that it would be restricted to these circumstances, and only these circumstances. What will likely happen is there will be broad and vaguely-worded legislation (if needed, even) allowing the Jobcentre to use discretion in sanctioning  ESA claimants who refuse medical treatment or lifestyle changes. And those rules could, conceivably, be interpreted by DWP officials in a wider scope, or otherwise expanded later. This approach could be extended to any claimant who is deemed to not be doing enough to get well. 

I would take objection to the implication that providing sickness benefits unconditionally, is in any way subsidising a luxurious ""lifestyle"". Most drug addicts and extremely obese desperately want out of their situation. And it isn't as easy or as simple as 1, 2, 3, gastric band (which has risks of complications). If you withdraw their money, they will become homeless and starve anyway. The government shouldn't coerce people into taking good choices for their lives, with the exception of criminals -- it violates a fundamental principle in the relationship between the state and the individual. And yes, when you are vulnerable and without any other reliable source of income, it *is* coercion to threaten to withdraw benefits. People with these sorts of conditions need help, by all means, but let it be in the form of incentives, not punishments. It sets a dangerous precedent giving the government this sort of power, and it will show less restraint in other forms of micro-managing people and families.

I have lived in a load of different countries and for me symptoms of ""a change in water"" barley last more than a few days at the most unless you pick up a localised bacteria or something by drinking stuff you know you should have boiled first (like communal well water in African villages)

Boil your water.  Obviously this will only work if every one is fit and healthy to start with (ie no one has Giardia or something).  Boil all water for at least 3 mins.  Do this for a fortnight.  Even the water you brush your teeth with.  When you do your washing up, dry with tea towels and everything in an oven at 120c for 5 mins to dry. Use a good anti bacterial hand wash constantly.  If you don't get better in a fortnight, what ever it is, its unlikely to be organic.  If you do get better - you know that something nasty is living in your pipes and needs to be sorted (or its chemical)

Does this affect everyone?  Some people are more susceptible to contaminates (both chemical and bacterial) than others.  I regularly give my family food poisoning by cooking with old things and left overs to the point where Mrs Dwair now supervises the fridge and I have special shelf of ""Dad Snacks"" that I'm forbidden to give the kids or anybody else. 

Is it periodic -  Does it get worse after heavy rain or every 2 or 3 weeks and then ease up?  Chemical run off from fields or additions at the treatment plant (eg when Aluminium sulfate is added periodically)   

Get your water tested.  Lots of places do this in the UK. EG ([Aqua Legion](http://www.aqualegion.com/water-testing/water-sample-testing/)) so ship some back home or find a local tester.  I'd go for the UK unless you speak technical French as the results may be difficult to interpret.

You said your folks built their house?  Are they on a mains supply or off a bore hole?  If they are on a bore hole, check the filtration is working as it should.  Consider upgrading to a more robust system and replacing the pipes on the domestic side.
 
What about the neighbors? Do they have a problem?

Other environmental stuff.  If your water is local or borehole, think about old mines and historical stuff.  N.W France was fought over so there might be old munitions or something leaching into the water table.  The water analysis should find if there is a issue here.

I don't think that's true. I think that we're getting fatter as a nation and the media have tried to turn that into a story about us being lazy. I think that given the right opportunities and encouragement people can change for the better. And I don't think ""You're a lazy cunt: Do something about it"" counts as encouragement.

&gt; and cheap food (which is only what many can afford) is the shit stuff that gets many into the state they are in.

It's not food being cheap that's the problem, it's processed, convenience food.
You can feed yourself cheaply using non-processed food (eating less meat helps) but if you're in a situation where you haven't the time or the energy to cook after work then you're in a bit of a bind. You could ""cook for the freezer"" at weekends but not everyone will be able to do that. But if the problem is that people aren't cooking for themselves or are cooking the wrong things then you could do worse than trying to educate them. The government ran massive food education campaigns during the war. What's stopping them doing that now? The Internet has endless free (at the point of delivery) resources about food, cookery and gardening. Help people work shorter hours (while maintaining their pay and holiday entitlement). Encourage them to get out and about at weekends. We've got a network of youth hostels FFS: Use them. Help make processed food less prevalent. Educate people on what food is available for free. Rosehips: You can eat them. You can dandelions as well. Do you have a garden or a space where you can put pots? You can grow stuff there and eat it. Do you cook for yourself? Do you know how to cook? It's not hard - Look! Free online courses! Make public transport worth using. Don't just randomly paint some lines on the floor - make actual cycle lanes and encourage people to use them. And if you're going to encourage people to cycle to work encourage employers to provide facilities where you can have a wash afterwards.

There are literally a thousand options available to the government in addition to taxation.
People were talking a few years ago about ""joined-up thinking"". This is what that looks like. The problem is systemic. So fix that system using education, legislation and taxation.

I think this is something that's really under-emphasised. We don't need meat at every single meal - there are plenty of other ways to get the nutritional content that it provides. When I'm in a calorie-tracking phase I'm always shocked at how quickly a couple of pieces of meat add up to over my RDA of protein! Having a single roast chicken breast or something with a salad or veg is fine, but when we're talking about deep-fried stuff pumped full of God knows what you're really not doing yourself any favours by eating it, especially when you partner it with some chips. 

Furthermore, as far as I'm aware livestock farming is worse for the environment than crop farming, so that's another benefit. Not to mention the fact that if we eat less meat we can afford to get free range and ethically-farmed meat, which is yet another benefit.

I agree with absolutely everything you said, btw. I've always said that it's not as simple as saying ""fat people are too lazy to get healthy"".

If you look at some of the advice above such as ""Tram to Princes Street or Airport Bus to Waverley Steps."" then the OP is going to have a problem as the Airport Bus doesn't go to Waverley Steps. If you are going to give advice to a tourist then you are best to give accurate information. 

So the reason I was saying that both drivers know where they are going is to reassure the OP. It simplifies the travel arrangements. They come out of the airport door where they will find the Airlink bus. At the end of that journey they cross the road to the taxi rank, the taxi driver stops directly outside St Leonards House. It's trouble free transport when the OP is probably anxious enough as it is about attending a university for the first time.

I doubt that the starting formation will be the diamond.  I think it will be the old Benitez 4-5-1.  Benteke, right now, is the only viable striker with out glut of attacking midfielders it makes the most sense to optimize the pool of players.

I suspect Can and Henderson will be the 'waist' of the formation with Can slotting into the old Stevie position of between the CB's or slotting off to the right (his old spot) when they get forward especially the fullbacks.  

This allows Can to sometimes join the attack if need be, and it opens Henderson up to pull the strings deeper.  Can's famous runs would allow Henderson to sit back in cover so they aren't left out.

Henderson can switch the side of attack with long balls something he is great at.  He is also a very underrated crosser of the ball.  And he can contribute with his own runs.

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,"Yvette, Stella, Tessa",null,"There are pretty serious problems with this article:

&gt;It’s a theory which appears to be underpinned by three supposed historical precedents

It is not only underpinned by those three historical precedents, as should be obvious from the ridiculously narrow parameters he sets up: Electoral history did not start in 1983 and is not confined to the UK. Historically, all of Labour's general election-winning leaders (MacDonald, Attlee, Wilson and Blair) were from the right of the party. Yes, even everyone's hero, Attlee. Additionally, although I don't know global politics so well, I do know that in other countries, we see a similar pattern of elections being won from the centre ground. Again, this should be fairly obvious: It's common knowledge that Blair lifted much of his strategy directly from Bill Clinton's successful 1992 campaign.

So, the whole contention of his article is fundamentally flawed, because he has failed to properly understand the nature and scope of the historical precedent involved in the 'winning from the centre-ground' theory. Incidentally, there are *also* flaws within each of his descriptions of the 'historical precedents', but since the whole premise is flawed, it doesn't seem like a good use of my time to go through and disprove them all individually.

However, he doesn't stop being wrong there! The argument that Corbyn is unlikely to win an election is not only underpinned by *historical* precedents. There have been numerous opinion polls and studies conducted since the election (and one from a few years previously), which, taken together provide really quite compelling evidence that Corbyn can't win for Labour:

* [The TUC's 2015 election post-mortem poll](http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2015/05/the-tucs-election-post-mortem-poll/), which found we were too soft on welfare and immigration, and not trusted on the economy (i.e., would tax and spend too much).

* [Listening to Labour's Lost Labour Voters](http://www.scribd.com/doc/271940748/Listening-to-Labour-s-Lost-Labour-Voters-bbm-Research-July-2015), by BBM Research, which confirms the findings of the TUC's poll.

* [Red Alert: Why Labour Lost and What Needs to Change?](https://smithinstitutethinktank.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/red-alert-why-labour-lost-and-what-needs-to-change.pdf), by the Smith Institute, which provides yet more evidence that Labour lost because it was untrusted on immigration and the economy.

* A [survey for YouGov/The Times](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/jvcr8gkvrb/SundayTimesResults_150724_W.pdf), that shows, yet again, that Labour weren't trusted on the economy.

* [The Mountain to Climb](http://www.fabians.org.uk/the-mountain-to-climb/), by the Fabian Society, which finds that our clearest path to victory is to win votes from Conservative voters.

* [Peter Kellner's research for Prospect/YouGov](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/labour-voters-election-europe-immigration), which shows that the votes Labour lost from 1997-2012 (the year the study was conducted) were lost primarily to its *right* not, as conventional wisdom assumes, to its left.

In other words, this article is essentially one long strawman, in that it assumes that

* There is a general 'don't turn into your comfort zone' argument
* There are three historical precedents that underpin that argument
* People believe Corbyn can't win because of both of the above

In fact, as I have shown, there is not only a general historical precedent that is much wider than he assumes (in that it goes back further and applies to countries other than the UK), but there is also a much deeper *specific* argument that in order to win the next election we need to do several things that are anathema to Corbyn and his followers.",null,0,null,1438159555,null,0,1438174814,0,ctk242q,null,t3_3ewvyl,null,t1_ctk242q,null,t3_3ewvyl,null,null,null,1440152838,null,4,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,4,null

Unlike the bias toward older age groups in parliament (even though I'd like to see a lot more younger MPs), the bias toward male MPs cannot be explained away by consideration for experience and a longer career history.

When was the last time a superintendent, any superintendent, made an arrest? Filled out a 124D? Knocked on doors? Wrestled with a drunk while praying that backup was round the corner?

No superintendent has just come off the streets. They've spent decades getting there and have spent most of that as a manager, being trained by other shit managers.

No superintendent makes a decision based solely on their own personal knowledge.

However there's a long way to go yet.  2 years ago he was breaking through, bursting with confidence and showing us his bag of tricks and everyone as on the Ross Barkley hype-train.  Last season he should have begun transitioning from massive potential to reliable performer.  He largely failed to do that, so this year is a big one for him.  It's not uncommon for young players to have a difficult second season as more is expected of them and more pressure placed upon their shoulders.  It's also worth noting that the whole team struggled last season, not just Ross.

We cannot be content with the state of the EU as it stands. But that does not mean walking away, but staying to fight together for a better Europe.”

That, to me, doesn't move his stance any further away from what it was two days ago - That we should try to reform the EU from within so that it doesn't become a power for inflicting austerity onto people. Nothing in what he says even mentions the referendum. 

His view throughout this campaign, from my interpretation, is that he supports the EU as a platform for the free movement of people and for ensuring peace across Europe, but not as a corporate entity, and that he supports membership but only if it can be reformed so that it doesn't seek to hurt people.

See this is another example of a trait I've noticed with Corbyn - that he is very good at saying the right words to give the people what they want to hear, whilst actually presenting a much more nuanced position. (Another example of this is the Ed Miliband question, people heard ""Corbyn would have Ed in his shadow cabinet"" but in fact he never said he would he only said that Ed was good at environment secretary and he would like Ed involved in those issues) Of course, this trait is a double-edged sword - it's bad because it could be interpreted as flip-flopping by people who don't observe what he actually says. But it could also be good, because that trait could be useful for, say, convincing a right-wing electorate that his party is the right one to form a government (because he could make Labour appear to support a right-wing platform whilst actually firmly standing on a hard left one)",null,0,null,1438162431,null,0,1438162911,0,ctk2ucq,null,t3_3ey7qn,null,t1_ctk2ucq,null,t1_ctjthwk,null,null,null,1440153182,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

I cycle to work, its 6 miles each way, it takes about 20-25 minutes. Its faster than a car. I burn around 600 calories each day doing it. 

I get to work, where my 8-10 work colleges have all driven in from no more than 5 miles away. Some as little as 2 miles.

So do I blame them? No (there are a bunch of reasons why this happens). But the attitude in this nation is such that this is now the norm, and while I appreciate its just the drive to work, its also an example of a bigger problem.

The most relevant sentence in your reply is the following:

""You have an obligation to ensure your family are supported after your death, not the taxpayer""

This is problematic for the following reasons:

a) The state is already expected to provide for hundreds of thousands of adults in the UK - providing for injured parties of will testaments would not seem to be such a huge burden on the state beyond what is already provided

b) The state could have otherwise seized the £164,000 awarded to the daughter and used that money how they saw fit (they could have then supplied her with the money to buy the house she was living in if they felt that that in the long run would save the government some money). With this in mind, it is hard to argue that the current legislation lessens the burden on the state.

c) If the money is being used to provide 'reasonable financial provision' for the daughter then that money is not being used to support thousands of other people in the country who are in financial need. These people are also a burden on the state. Therefore, sequestering all that money for the benefit of one person, when it could otherwise be distributed to many persons presents no clear, identifiable relief to the state.

With this in mind, you have failed to provide a good reason why, in 21st century Britain, an adult child of the deceased (who ought to be reasonably expected to be independent) is any more entitled to the assets of the deceased than any other adult in the UK...given that we have knowledge that the deceased expressed no preference towards the child

The only way in which the legislation can be justified is if we argue that the innate bonds of family have more value than the will and testament of the living.

He never said he would say ""No"" either. The thing about Corbyn is that he is a guy with very nuanced positions in a world that wants black and white answers. He doesn't answer in the affirmative because reality is complicated and Corbyn is a rare example of an honest politician. 

The summary of Corbyn's position is that the EU has benefits and drawbacks and he would vote to leave the EU if it became clear that the drawbacks are outweighing the benefits. Which, whilst is a sensible position that surely everyone should have, isn't the one the people want to hear. Luckily for Corbyn, he has this magic ability to have his words spun into what people want to hear without actually saying anything other than his actual position.

that's why when chelsea or arsenal spend 30 mill they are able to bring in a ""proven"" player, someone like sanchez, diego costa or hazard but if you are liverpool (or us) you are going to end up with someone like carroll, benteke (we'll see how that works out) or  lamela who is still a large risk.

that's why I think our best buys historically haven't been the most expensive ones, those have always been our desperation buys and rarely work out as planned (bent, bentley, soldado, lamela, paulinho).

Corbyn is winning by 22% on first-preference votes, but that doesn't matter right now because first-preference votes only put him at 42%.

Depends what's in the system. Might not be BBC content but if there's some larger agreement about the use it makes it much easier. One of the benefits of being a large broadcaster, I suppose.

&gt; That cannot be easy unless you are an experienced producer and know the right chains to pull.

Yeah, there will be things that are harder to get, and I do think they do a great job :)

Definitely. It opens up some interesting things, like different length programmes (no need to pad or cut out bits) and different release dates (like netflix releasing a whole season at once).

If no, then do you agree that the primary reason for the percentages as they stand now are institutionalised sexism?

History shows that only action counters this societal bias. It is only unfair if as a male candidate you don't accept how society already has an institutional bias toward favouring you as a candidate, and it is only unfair to women if you carry the belief that society isn't already biased against them. I understand why it is difficult for a lot of men to accept that this is the case as it's difficult to take on the fact that you benefit from society's ingrained prejudices. As a white person, it wasn't nice to realise the ways in which I benefit from underlying racism.

I would also ask what you think should be done, if anything at all? I do think unwillingness must contribute a little... as a woman, I personally find the jeering Westminster old boy's club to be a very offputting environment to work even as someone who would love to work hard to represent constituents. The Scottish Parliament is arguably better at this. The environment is more female-friendly and has slightly higher representation (35%) but still doesn't come close to reflecting society.

I think a lot of it is the same sexism that faces women in so many professional careers, the false belief that men somehow inherently possess more of the qualities that make a good ""x"" or the notion that women will always be sidetracked by family (or indeed that men will never sidetracked by family because society tells men that their place is always in work... a decision to predominantly raise the kids is still seen as inherently unmasculine by many, and indeed, functions of legislation such as parental leave work practically against favouring these arrangements generally).

He does however not use his height/build very well.

When featuring in the first team previously he didn't win any balls up high, and was brushed off by strong defenders surprisingly (and annoyingly) easy. If he can concentrate on bulking up over the next couple of years then he'll be on course to be a decent striker.

null,false,Geisterkrieg,,Labour Member,null,"&gt; It has always been an alliance of people on the centre-left. The 'old far left' (e.g., the Communist Party) was never allowed to affiliate, which is why when the far left tried to enter the party (in the form of Militant), it did so in an underhand manner, broke the rules of the party, and was expelled.

I happen to specialise in early twentieth century political thought (largely in continental Europe but also in Britain to a lesser extent) and I think you're mixing a lot of things up here. The Communist Party was founded in 1920, well after Labour, and many of its members came from the Independent Labour Party, which was still affiliated to Labour at that time. ~~It was not a question of Labour denying them entry: the Communist Party explicitly adopted a policy of refusing to affiliate with Labour.~~ (e: A few years later, at any rate, as it turns out this wasn't true originally, see below -- but the next section still holds!)

This makes perfect sense, since there were plenty of Marxists in the original Labour Party, and indeed the Social Democratic Federation, which alongside the Fabians and Independent Labour was one of the three major components of the original Labour Representation Committee, was an explicitly Marxist organisation. The Labour Party was intended as an alliance of the working class as a whole -- not to represent a specific overall political position, much less the 'centre left', which is a term that I don't think was in common currency until later British political history. The Labour movement always had an important 'far left' component.

As far as Militant goes, they were never breaking any rules simply by being Trotskyists in the party, as you seem to suggest -- there's a reason the party establishment under Foot (who, we should remember, was actually seen as being on the centre of the party at the time) was reluctant to do anything about them. The problem came when they started flagrantly breaking any semblance of party discipline, and that has little to do with being 'far left' or 'centre left'. 

I think you're missing the point deliberately in the last part of your post, because it should be relatively easy to see why many people are uneasy about Harman's announcement: they are not sure whether it will be used as an excuse to get rid of Corbyn supporters who are not, in fact, members of other political parties, previous members of Labour, and so on. There is no obvious transparency behind the process being used to determine these facts. A lot of people I've spoken to who support Corbyn are pretty ordinary people, mostly disinterested in politics and who've never been members of Labour before -- but the worry is that they might be seen as entryists simply because of that. Whether it's ultimately an unfounded worry or not, it's an understandable one and certainly isn't 'scaremongering'.",null,0,null,1438165446,null,0,1438167750,0,ctk3lwl,null,t3_3ewalb,null,t1_ctk3lwl,null,t1_ctk1klz,null,null,null,1440153543,null,0,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,0,null

null,false,Dugg,english,Lancashire,null,"&gt;The fact that it's paid separately, AND it's a different price from provider to provider shows that it's being used by ISPs as a way of boosting revenue. 

It's a seperate service. You can get your line rental directly from BT and subsequently pay say Plusnet for just the broadband. You can pay the line rental up front for the year.

&gt;Howcome the actual price of broadband is rarely increased, in fact howcome so many providers are able to offer 'free' broadband for 12 months? It's because the price they charge for line rental is way more than what BT Openreach are charging them.

The internet aspect of running an ISP is cheap as you only have to deal with what comes from the exchanges not homes - and if you are not unbundling then its even cheaper as BT come to you. 

&gt;If BT Openreach charges a fixed price to all ISPs, then we should be paying the same line rental fee across all ISPs, the difference should just be in the cost of the broadband.

It's down to the service provider how they charge you this fee. Most providers require their own line rental and require contracts to guarantee their income for the year. 

Most of the ""free"" tiers are either low usage or low speeds encouraging the consumer to buy the more expensive product. Or bundled with TV where your monthly bill comes beyond £60 a month anyway. 

Free tiers also often require that they have their own equipment in the exchanges meaning they can provide a cheaper service.

&gt;Look at the market over the last few years - in just a few years, line rental has been increased steadily from around £10/mth to around £17/mth, yet broadband charges haven't moved.

2 different products. 

&gt;THIS is why the costs should be combined and advertised together for the benefit of consumers, the same way as airlines are forced to advertise the combined price of all mandatory elements together when advertising how much their flights cost.

&gt;Harman said she had been personally seeking reports on the integrity of the process *before* the weekend allegations of entryism by the hard left and calls for the process to be suspended.

So Harman was looking into the process before anyone made an allegation of entryism.

The specific problem here is *[entryism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entryism)*, that is, 'a political strategy in which an organisation or state encourages its members or supporters to join another, usually larger organisation in an attempt to expand influence and expand their ideas and program'. The problem is not that they are left-wing, it is that they are entryists. That is why Toby Young and other Conservatives have been prevented from joining. They are not left-wing, but they *are* entryists. So you're wrong.

The only people who have been prevented from voting are people who demonstrably cannot in good faith uphold the statement:

&gt;“I support the aims and values of the Labour Party, and I am not a supporter of any organisation opposed to it.” 

This does *not* include everyone who can be described as 'hard left'. The reason this should be obvious to you is that, as you say, Jeremy Corbyn is a member of the hard left and, far from not being able to *vote* in the contest is in fact *running* in it.

1. Voice usage is vastly declining, most people I know don't even have a phone attached, they have a line just for broadband. (You could argue in this case that if you explicitly requested broadband-only service the ISP could wrap the line rental into the cost of the broadband).

2. A lot of ISPs actually mandate that you take the line rental from them, you're not allowed to switch the line rental away to another provider (Which sorta backs my point that it's a significant chunk of their revenue in providing broadband).

3. Howcome line rental has increased every 6 months for the last few years from £10/mth to around £17-18/mth, yet broadband has never really been increased by much? Surely lines have not suddenly become 1.7 TIMES more expensive to maintain than they have been in the past where line rental was around the £10/mth for many many years?

4. Just as an aside, it's interesting the Virgin Media, who don't NEED a phone line to provide broadband, actually penalise you by charging more if you choose to go without a phone line.

&gt;However, despite the support of James Maxton, the Independent Labour Party leader, **the Labour Party decided against the affiliation of the Communist Party**. Even while pursuing affiliation and seeking to influence Labour Party members, however, the CPGB promoted candidates of its own at parliamentary elections.

That seems pretty clear to me. I do know there was intense debate within the CPGB about whether to pursue affiliation but clearly the Labour Party refused it in any case.

I didn't mean to suggest that Militant were expelled for being Trotskyists, sorry if it came across that way. My point was meant to be that the fact that they *had* to practise entryism was evidence that the Labour Party has rejected far-left politics for a very long time.

As for the scaremongering: No. I cannot see why people are worried by Harman's statements.

&gt;Harriet Harman, the interim Labour leader, has defended the integrity of her party’s leadership election system amid claims it has been infiltrated by hard left extremists as well as Conservatives out to discredit the process.

So, she's defending a system *against* claims it has been infiltrated. Not worrying.

&gt;She said “rigorous due diligence” was being undertaken by Labour staff, and the new electoral system introduced in 2014 was less open to manipulation than its predecessor, which freely allowed opponents of Labour to vote without any checks.

She's making sure we have a thorough system that prevents people from deliberately underming the process.

&gt;Harman said she had been personally seeking reports on the integrity of the process before the weekend allegations of entryism by the hard left and calls for the process to be suspended.

She started investigating the process *before* the allegations of entryism arose. It is very difficult to square this with the idea that the investigation is desgined to root out anyone who is left wing.

&gt;“We are policing the integrity of this process. My job is to ensure the rules for this election agreed in 2014 are properly applied. The system is designed to give people that are supporters of the party, but not necessarily a member, a say in choosing the leader of the Labour party.

&gt;“I have been concerned right from the outset that we should have absolute integrity in the process and that we should be rigorous and robust in our verification. We have got an extensive verification system in place. We are doing everything possible to ensure the process is valid. Under the old system you could be card-carrying member of another party and you still got a vote. We are now requiring people to say if they are Labour party members or supporters.”

Two paragraphs of direct quotations from Harman and not a single mention of trying to prevent left-wing entryism.

&gt;She pointed out the party had tracked down some Green party members trying to join the party as bogus registered supporters through social media such as Facebook. Harman said other bogus entrants weeded out by the party were Toby Young, the Telegraph columnist, and Derek Hatton, the former Militant council leader in Liverpool.

&gt;Harman said Young’s cited reason for joining the party was to consign the Labour party to electoral oblivion. Another bogus applicant put as the reason for registering a desire to put Labour out of power for 20 years.

She then gives examples of people who have been prevented from joining, citing only people who are members of other parties, have been expelled from Labour, or put down obviously foolish things as their reason for joining.

You have somehow interpeted this information to mean that 'ordinary people' 'might be seen as entryists'. There is *no way* you can derive that from this article. It is simply inconceivable that you can believe that preventing members of other political parties and people who have openly stated that they are trying to destroy the party from voting might accidentally prevent 'ordinary people' from voting.

In case you didn't notice. They cleared this across the board for basically all athletes from the country not just the guys who are sailing.

As for coming from the elite. No most of the people who sail do not come from an elite background. The cost of actually getting new people onto he water is probably way cheaper than you can imagine to get into the sport. In fact if you have a good character are able and willing and show up on time be reliable  you can basically sail free of any charges other than some labour now and then

Also the guys club isn't exclusive membership. Anyone can join. Its not difficult. In fact the costs would be in-line with a sky contract which is not exactly ""elite"" status of costs. You could also get a 2nd hand boat for under £500 which would last a number of years for somebody new to the sport and guess what. the boats actually hold their value reasonably well.

I'm not sure I agree with you when you say that quoting the first preference percentage is disingenuous.  If it is true to say that he is the first choice of 42%, then this is significant, don't forget that the Tories have a clear majority with only 34% of the vote.  Not directly comparable I know, but still relevant.  Also, gaining an extra 8% is by no means unimaginable.

I don't agree with everything he is saying, but I do think he's a breath of fresh air, and if he leads the Labour party back to it's natural ethos if only for a short while IMO that can't be a bad thing.  Some of it might stick, and I think it's time someone challenged the cosy consensus about neo liberalism and the shrinking of the state, with creeping privatisation and the rise of the state supported corporation.  A change of narrative and a conversation about what actually might be possible regarding re-nationalisation for example, and a genuine stab at addressing the rise in inequality would be most welcome.

* Front wheel lower = risk you could 'roll off' the side stand (as most side stands fold towards the rear)
* Side stand on higher side = bike much more 'upright' &amp; more likely to fall over

If in doubt, park in a fulls-size spot ideally leaving enough room for another bike if possible - that way if another bike turns up he doesn't have to use another full size spot too.

Something has happened to cause a surge in obesity in the last 30-40 years. 

Yes, calorie expenditure has decreased, but previously people would subconsciously adjust their calorie intake to suit. This seems to have stopped happening. 

Why is a more difficult question. This is thought to be at least partly due to dietary refined carbs and sugar, which are known to disrupt the body's hormonal mechanism for sensing calorie balance. This is particularly a problem with convenience foods which are high in fat for palatability, but also high in sugar/refined carbs which prevents the body from feeling ""full"". 

Then you have soda pop, often packed with addictive caffeine, addictive sugar and salt to make you thirsty. 

Perhaps we need to treat this type of high sugar high calorie food like tobacco - ban advertising, require plain packaging with prominent health warnings and not place it on open access shelving (only behind the counter).

The methodology applied here is sloppy at best, a ton of factors lead to Nixon's victory, and while with a simple understanding of things now and then you can draw parallels, these fade away under any in depth look at how things were then and are now.

Politics needs to change if we are to stand any hope of avoiding catastrophic climate change driven by political corruption and ideological blindness. We will not bring about that change by doubting principles that e don't just hold in our hearts but know in our heads to be true.

I really hope that project fear (http://www.leninology.co.uk/2015/07/project-fear-versus-corbyn.html) doesn't cause Labour members to abandon their principles when they cast their votes in their leadership election. 

I really hope the Labour party executive isn't so corrupt as to exclude everyone they've managed to engage with the political process by kicking them out of the party because they don't agree with the big money sloshing around in the party and corporate interests.

If that happens, and you end up with a leader with no principles, remember the Green Party is here, lots of us have spent years building a frame work (often informed by negative experiences in the Labour Party) that won't allow for the same top down control. We don't throw people out because they threaten to change the status quo of the party (just wait till you see the agenda for conference, it is clear the surge is having an impact on what our policies will be). 

If you manage to overcome the voices of fear and the establishment control of your party and elect a progressive leader I still think you need to do much more to fix the Labour Party. 

That said we are not tribal in the Green Party, we want to work with progressive forces across party lines. Regardless of the outcome of your leadership election to consider joining a cross party group like http://www.compassonline.org.uk/

You should look at around £400 per month. Bills are dependant on numbers of occupants but in my two-person flat we pay around £150 each per month on bills. 40% of this is council tax which your friend will be exempt from if he is living with other students.

""Also with buying food/going out every now and then.""

If he has lots of time he can find cheap food - get out to the greengrocers and butchers rather than the big supermarkets. As for going out: a main course in a typical restaurant is £10. A beer in a bar is £3.80. Though there are many ways of enjoying yourself for less money if you hunt around.

""Is public transport expensive ?""

A day pass is £4.40 for the buses. A monthly pass is £66. The cheapest way to get around the country is by coach. I'm heading to London shortly and it is £15 return, but booked with 2 weeks notice. A train is a little quicker but costs £56 off-peak.

""Is it hard to stay in Bristol after finishing his course?""

Assuming you have no visa issues, then it is simple enough. I did exactly that. Bristol has the most amount of degrees per head of population. I think that is because many students fall in love with the place. There are jobs around if you are qualified, speak English to a high standard and are a pleasant person.

""He owns a driving license but is that same license valid in the UK?""

I am not sure in this area but I suspect he would need an international drivers licence which he would have to get from Brazil 
and it would be valid for one year. He would have to then take a British test which would cost around £25 per lesson and then £25 for the theory test and £70ish for the practical. Assuming he owns a car he would need a residents parking permit which would be around £50 a year - though if he is sharing a house with other car owners then it might not be that straight forward and the cost can creep up for a 2nd or 3rd car to as much as £200.

""Last question is if he is going to have any problems being an immigrant studying in Bristol. He doesn't want to force his culture upon others but rather would like to get to know the english culture and maybe one day be a part of it and live there permanently.""

We are a city of immigrants. I could stand outside my office in central Bristol and would hear a foreign language within a couple of minutes. Its a friendly city and as long as he puts in some effort with meeting people and with the language then it won't be a problem.

I think you need to do more research.....

To start with its 2 prior members must support you application. This is not hard to achieve... A committee member must approve in almost any club for new members. This is just process it is unlikely to ever been rejected without a damn good reason.

Who said you actually had to own a boat to sail regularly on a boat? Other people own boats and are often looking for people to crew on them typically with no charge only some help with some minor maintenance and cleaning and stuff like that. Total cost here can be £0 since only the owner of the boat actually has to be the member of the club.

What your not aware of here is how the clubs work and operate. Yes it's difficult to find out how this sort of stuff works sometime. But basically if you actually turned up and ask'ed people would actually explain it to you.

Unless of course you come across as a complete dick...... In which case they will tell you to go away just like almost any club or community would.... regardless of what sport it is

Incidentally? The problem with hypothyroid states is that your basal metabolic rate drops. You don't burn as much energy. So you may eat normally and hit your 1800 Kcal to 2200 Kcal diet per day but still put on weight cause you are only burning 1400 or so and the issue is that hypothyroid patients get tired easily. The reverse is true for Hyperthyroid since they can eat 2200 Kcal and lose weight and even ""starve"". My personal favourite was a young lady with hyperthyroid who regularly ate 3000 Kcal meals and came in with starvation. She simply couldn't eat enough food to match her body's metabolic rate and she literally was running a fever 24/7 as her body was burning calories like that.

In Liverpool we had the door stabbed with a screwdriver to open it and a skateboard nicked from the back seat. In Manchester we had petrol taken from our petrol tank. HAHA, just remembered that in Manchester, we'd been there a week and a bus drove into a corner shop near our house. The next week the riots happened, ah memories. 

The first time my SO ever went to Bradford, there was a car swerving everywhere, we assumed drunk. Turned out he had chips on his passenger seat and was leaning over to pick some up and eat them, and every time lurching to the left. That was pretty standard dumb Bradford driving behaviour.

But seriously Bournemouth is so much worse. I've gained more ""Man, the other day I saw this guy do X"" stories in the 3 years I've been here than in my entire life. (about 5 bikes knocked down by that junction next to the hop and kilderkin in winton, 2 cars crash into the same wall within a month of eachother in pokesdown, saw a guy go the wrong way down alma road when it was made one way, and he just veered into the traffic cones, sending them flying (which was cool, I'll not deny) and shot round the cars. We've had loads of scrapes up the corners of the car, seen a bunch of people bump corners and then drive off.) 

It's not all bournemouth drivers, and I'm not saying most drivers are bumping when parallel parking, I'm saying most HAVE BEEN BUMPED. Honestly next time you're sat in traffic or walking in a car park just have a look at the corners and sides. It's never that most people are shit drivers, it's that the percentage is so high that you're regularly encountering them.

null,false,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,null,"&gt;The problem with hypothyroid states is that your basal metabolic rate drops. You don't burn as much energy. So you may eat normally and hit your 1800 Kcal to 2200 Kcal diet per day but still put on weight cause you are only burning 1400 or so and the issue is that hypothyroid patients get tired easily. The reverse is true for Hyperthyroid since they can eat 2200 Kcal and lose weight and even ""starve"".

So, are you telling me that altering you diet up or down can counteract the effects of hypo/underactive thyroid? Just like I said above? So we're back to square one, then. 

Glad you needed a PHD to tell me what I already said. 

&gt;My personal favourite was a young lady with hyperthyroid who regularly ate 3000 Kcal meals and came in with starvation. She simply couldn't eat enough food to match her body's metabolic rate and she literally was running a fever 24/7 as her body was burning calories like that.

Sheffield and Nottingham are both within easy travelling distance, and there are buses to Manchester but it takes half the day to get there. I've tried to refrain from Googling, as you can do that yourself, but you might like to consider the following:

&gt; Art

You might like the [QUAD](http://www.derbyquad.co.uk/), in Derby city centre - they have some pretty good arty films in the cinema bit, and I believe all of their exhibitions are free entry.

On a less regular basis, [Chatsworth House](http://www.chatsworth.org/attractions-and-events/events/event/beyond-limits-sculpture-exhibition-in-the-garden) hosts a sculpture exhibition fairly often (next on 14/09 to 25/10) and is about 25 minutes' drive from the city centre. Well worth a look in my opinion.

&gt; Live Music

Don't know much about this myself, but the Sitwell Tavern has live rock music weekly, and the Vic near the train station also has live music on. There are night buses to and from Nottingham at the weekends, which should have a better selection.

&gt; Caving

There are a fair few limestone caves in Derbyshire, and some of the areas have regular buses from the city centre (Buxton, Matlock, Ashbourne), as well as places like the [Blue John Cavern](http://www.bluejohn-cavern.co.uk/) in Castleton, which is fairly well known.

&gt; Book Stores and Libraries

Derby City library is pretty standard as far as libraries go, nothing special but not too shabby either. In my opinion, the best second hand bookshop in Derbyshire is Scarthin's in Cromford, which is a bizarre little place but definitely worth a visit. Catch the train there, it's quicker and cheaper than the bus, and wander up Black Rocks whilst you're there.

&gt; Beer

Derby is the best place in the world for proper beer, and don't let the heathens from Sheffield try and convince you otherwise. I'd pick up a copy of the Good Beer Guide from CAMRA, and visit a few of the pubs from that. Little Chester Ale House, five minutes' walk from the city centre, has had some rave reviews. The real ale festival in Derby is also huge, and very popular.

N'Zonzi, Begovic, and Moses who were solid players for us last year but they all left.

- Our star player will most likely be Bojan Kirkic. He is coming off of a season ending injury last year and may struggle to come back to the form he was playing in when he was injured. He will be the center of our offense, picking out passes and carrying the ball towards the box with pace at the center of the field, and hopefully scoring a few goals.

Arrested? No. Not everything is so dramatic. That's not even what's being discussed.

I'm saying the image of a stoner sitting around doing nothing forever isn't helping the legalisation campaign. That's all. Giant give a crap what the guy does or doesn't do, the image of the generic stoner is not helping. That's all.

You show the fencers a handful of millionaire suits that like to wind down with a joint or two wanting to make it all legal and they're more likely to back your campaign than if you showed them the image of someone living off the dole with no prospects, motivation or ambition who does nothing but talk about pot and pot related subjects 

&gt; Also, how is it any different from people who sit inside all day and binge watch Netflix and eat shit? Or guzzle energy drinks and play League?

It's not different, but those things are already legal. I think your argument has veered off on the wrong path a bit here 

&gt; Surely it's my right as an adult to spend my time how I want so long as it doesn't negatively effect someone else?

Dude giant who cares what you do! Indeed, do what you want. This is not a personal argument nor am I saying you should be allowed to smoke or should not. I don't care either way. That's the entire thing about being on the fence. There's no persecution, but there's no votes to back it if the option ever comes up.

Why is it embarrassing? This is what happens when everybody's parents drum it into them that they have to get qualifications, and go to college, and university ""otherwise you'll end up working in a supermarket"". It's a job. It's not glamorous, or, I imagine, particularly well-paid, but it's not embarrassing. It's good you want to do better for yourself, but don't be embarrassed about what you do now. It's less embarrassing than refusing to take a supermarket job and being on benefits because ""working in a supermarket is embarrassing"".

Have you thought about going back to education? I went to university when I was 25, and it paid off. I only did an HND so I only had 2 years to fend for myself, which can even be done without a part-time job if you don't mind getting your hands dirty during the holidays. Rather than age being a hindrance, the fact that you've got a few years of getting up and going to work every day under your belt means it'll be easier for you than for the kids straight out of school. It also means you can probably cope with the social life without it affecting your studies.

You literally have to deal with issues head on. Sober. 

This, in turn, can cause anxiety to creep in which can get quite bad if you don't realise that it's your sobriety that's actually causing the anxiety in the first place and deal with it. 

Also speaking of using alcohol as a crutch ( as a lot of people do )  this can also be a dangerous thing as it only takes one life event ( a death, a tragedy, divorce, heartbreak, loss of job etc. etc. ) to turn a normal person into a complete alcoholic. Especially if they've been drinking steadily away for years. Since I stopped drinking I've mentored a few alcoholics and there's definitely an underlying theme there. One event or a series of events that changed them from being a normal person to an alcoholic. It doesn't discriminate either, I've mentored people from the unemployed to professionals. 

FTR for me that trigger was the death of my parents and a girlfriend who walked away at a time when I needed the support. I don't however blame that ( or them )  I blame myself for not recognising the signs and hitting the bottle. Didn't at the time though, I blamed *everyone* apart from myself.

Where I live has few street lights, many single lane tree covered country roads and even in the dead of night with a cloudy sky you can still see where you are going. Our vision in the dark isn't great compared to some animals, but we're not blind either.

If anything around here the odd street light dotted about does more harm than good. It makes just enough difference to your night vision that you can then not see clearly in the dark again for a (very) short while.

As for driving without street lights, I personally don't see much of a difference. It's not the lack of street lighting that gets me, it's the abrupt end of street lighting. Even on twisty national speed limit roads your cars high beams do the job plenty well enough and if anything it gives you a better warning of approaching cars. Stick the beams off while you pass another drive, slow down a tad, stick them on when they pass.

-The fridge requires 80W, it was the only thing I left on.

-Our lightbulbs eat up 70W each

-8 lights were left turned on, plus the bathroom extractor.

-So at the very least we would be looking at 2£ a day in electricity, with all of that turned on.


From this, I gather that it was the letting agent's fault. Even if the standing charge had amounted to 3£ (which it didn't, by far) the house should have had enough electricity to keep running were it not for him leaving the lights on. We usually don't need more than 75p a day because we barely turn the lights on, and when we do we use bedside lamps with low consumption bulbs.

So, is there any way I can ask for compensation from them?

Thyroid issues slow your metabolism, so the body treats more calories as ""excess"" because it simply can't work through them to burn it. This is why things like tiredness and sensitivity to cold are also symptoms: your body is struggling to process enough food to burn, so it ends up stored as fat instead. Moving and heating your body uses energy, so hypothyroidism makes you tried and sensitive to cold.

He would, I imagine, first of all, express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people, he would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life, and the vanity of all the labours of man, which could thus be annihilated in a moment. He would too, perhaps, if he was a man of speculation, enter into many reasonings concerning the effects which this disaster might produce upon the commerce of Europe, and the trade and business of the world in general. And when all this fine philosophy was over, when all these humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed, he would pursue his business or his pleasure, take his repose or his diversion, with the same ease and tranquillity, as if no such accident had happened.

 Illegal migrants would try to get to the UK whether we have our borders or not. The problem is their volume and the fact they all end up going through Calais.

None:

So the £3.9k take home would be what you'd have if no  deductions other than income tax and NI were taken from your £68k.  You see that explicitly if you [click through](http://www.netsalarycalculator.co.uk/68000-after-tax/).

You'd have to clarify that with the recruiter.  Some, rare, employers will chuck a certain amount into your pension on top of your basic salary regardless of what you do.

So no midfielder - Kdb, Isco, or any - will be asked to high press all match, and few will be asked to drop deep into their own half. Say what you want about that formula working, that's the way it is.  It's the reason City got a guy like Delph, who will work tirelessly box-to-box to win balls and get the ball forward. So the AMs *don't* have to do that. 

If you want high pressure, you're not going to see it at City and literally no purchase would add that to the squad, because it really depends on the manager's system.

I don't know. Do you really want to check the statistics over how many British or French police (or just people) have been killed by migrants? They can't openly bring in weapons, so they use their overall numbers as a weapon. It's known as asymmetrical warfare, and it's used whenever a group is facing a larger force that they can't yet oppose through conventional firepower. 

&gt;An invasion needs to have the express intent of conquering, liberating or re-establishing control or authority over a territory. It isn't some organised attempt by third world nations to destroy the west.

The intent, by many, is clear. Many Islamic leaders have openly called for Shariah law to be implemented in the UK. Be honest - don't you think most of these migrants would love to see crescent moon flag raised over Buckingham palace?  I don't think it's overall an organized effort, but that's not a requirement for an invasion. Locusts can invade a country by the millions, but they are driven by hunger and the desire to reproduce, and they don't have a government.

&gt; if you asked the migrants if they wanted to destroy Britain, what do you think they would say? 

Of course not, but what does that matter? You mention the word ""destroy"" several times, but look at that definition above. No where is the word ""destroy"" used. Hitler originally didn't want to destroy France or the UK either, he wanted to add them to his empire intact!!!

Finally, if you have any doubts if this is an invasion, look at this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=73&amp;v=Ax6Kd0KSryM).

I notice you don't attempt to explain what those other things affecting Nixon's victory were. Suffice to say George McGovern's incredibly weak candidacy was the decisive factor in turning the 1972 election into a crushing victory for Nixon, given a weak economy, and an unpopular war in Vietnam (which is why the Democrats held Congress).

Incidentally, I know Butler and have spoken with him on this topic - his thinking on it is far from ""sloppy"".

&gt;If that happens, and you end up with a leader with no principles,

Why are you using ""principles"" as a synonym for ""person I agree with""? People in more moderate wings of the party aren't sellouts for not agreeing with Corbyn.

&gt;remember the Green Party is here, lots of us have spent years building a frame work (often informed by negative experiences in the Labour Party) that won't allow for the same top down control. We don't throw people out because they threaten to change the status quo of the party

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"Or we could talk about how obese people are excessively defensive because people call them land whales? Or because the very notion of land whale brings to mind people who are morbidly and grotesquely obese which makes people who are overweight and just into obesity justifying their weight. 

People stay fat cause it is easier to stay fat. Losing weight requires effort that some people cannot put up. In addition people who call them land whales often turn the experience of weight loss into something quite awful and many are put off by the gym and weight loss because of the wankers that do have the time. 

It's simple. Your argument is ""why can't you eat and work out like me"". Mine is ""If we were to measure the amount of effort required for our respective jobs. Yours is a 9 to 5 or thereabous, mine is I work to my job and it is always going to be 8 to whenever. I don't really get weekends off. For me exercise is a hassle. Something that cuts into my sleep. I run cause I like to stay fit but I have to JUSTIFY running. It's easier and indeeed better for me to sleep an extra hour and get 7 hours of sleep rather than 6. 

It's easy to place the blame on people who often didn't know what their portion sizes were or who picked up stress eating as a kid or who came from families that didn't know how to eat healthy. Discipline is easy to get when young but harder as adults. 

What adults work best in is a relatively encouraging environment that gets them moving. Not by you being a dick and calling people land whales. 

In order to fight obesity you must address the causes of obesity and the only way you deal with the problem is the basic biology ignoring that people are much more complex than that.

Everything you've said is correct, and none of it lines up with your earlier post that rationalised obesity. Obesity is **not** ok, ever, for any reason. Are there reasons it happens? Yes, there are, and you're right they need to be addressed.

Qualifications come fairly low down on my list of considerations when I look to hire someone. 

Far more important is that someone can understand an audience, how to engage those audiences and that they can actually write. I'd learn much more about how suitable a candidate is by reading their blog than their CV.

If you really want to start writing, my advice would be to start writing - about anything that appeals to you. Sumbit some of your better work to a blog (either your own or somewhere like Medium is a good start) and when you've built up a strong portfolio, start dropping your work through the door of PR, marketing or content agencies. 

Even big brands are starting to invest a lot more in content as a marketing tool. You say you work in a supermarket, so why not write about issues that would appeal to some of your customers (we've just done a big project around the issue of food waste)? Could you come up with an idea that would inspire your customers to try something new? If you think it's good enough, send it and some of your employer's marketing department - a lot of big brands like that really do like to promote from within so you could open a few doors that way. 

It's not going to be a quick fix but if writing is something that you want to be doing for the next 35 years or so, then it'll be worth stacking a few more shelves.

That parliament isn't 50/50 shows that it's not meritocratic, so OPs whole argument falls down unless we are willing to assume the reason women haven't been able to excel in certain fields is because women are less competent, from the outset; in which case the argument makes sense...

A bit self fulfilling though eh?

Which is why  people who don't subscribe to the view that men are ""better"" than women reject it.

With all that said, I can certainly see why the quotas infuriate people and many, many women are as opposed to quotas as men but obviously for different, more objectively legitimate reasons. For example, many women can feel that quotas only serve to reinforce a lot of the aforementioned sexist preconceptions people already have.

(a) it was made in the course of the normal duties of the employee or in the course of duties falling outside his normal duties, but specifically assigned to him, and the circumstances in either case were such that an invention might reasonably be expected to result from the carrying out of his duties; or

(b) the invention was made in the course of the duties of the employee and, at the time of making the invention, because of the nature of his duties and the particular responsibilities arising from the nature of his duties he had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer’s undertaking.

Section 42 then explains that any contract term further diminishing the employee's rights is unenforceable (with certain caveats). So it may be the case that the clause re anything ""capable of being used or adapted for use"" by the employer is not enforceable.

I have come home on some days, ordered takeaway and then slept because I was so tired. Like halfway through a mouthful. I once fell asleep taking a shower. 36 hours awake will do that to you. 

It's simple for you but you may not realise other people don't have your job and your stresses or may not deal with them in a healthy way. Okay put it this way. 

I do surgery. Day in and day out. It's simple for me. Asking you to do it would be a total shit show. You are asking people to lose habits learned over childhood. 

If quitting was that simple we would have no smokers, no alcoholics and no drug users. 

Who says I paint it as acceptable? Do you know who people listen to when they say ""you are overweight? Is it A) Random Stranger in Gym or B) Doctor"" Hint. it's doctor. 

Who rationalised obesity? I understand why obesity occurs beyond the frankly simple answer. Saying ""endeavour to not eat so much"" is like shouting DODGE at a rugby player from the side lines. 

And you start by trying to not insult the people you are trying to help. Because if I called my patients tubby land whales they wouldn't want to engage with my ideas for say... community exercise. Or healthy ideas. Or trying to create online groups to support each other's weight loss in a healthy way that's not filled with super young people who got into crazy work outs. 

Do you know what puts fat people off from losing weight? The fact they are going to get judged by some guy. And the fact they are told that weight loss is easy. It is not. It is hard. It is easy for you cause you have done it. Knowing something is hard but worthwhile gets people to stick to the damn plan. 

As I said. I have a pretty good record with this since I cannot operate on people who are obese and weight reduction is a major part of my treatment plans. Knowing how and why people overeat can allow you to use transference to things that are more productive. Or inculcate good habits. 

Like ""hey I overeat every meal"". Okay. Drink a glass of water before your meal. Then use smaller dishes. This will help reduce what you eat. Don't binge if you have a meal outside. Once in a while those aren't bad. But get back on the diet immediately.

**Suarez** - Absolutely brilliant to watch, his work rate, he is a predator who preys on defenders mistakes.

**Playing style** - I love high pressing football and attacking minded. For example I couldn't ever support Chelsea, 
because their games are so booring to watch. I know this is how titles are won and everything, but look back at the 13/14 
Liverpool came so close to win it with a beautiful football. (There was some grinded out games, like vs Manu 1-0).

To the point: Last season problems were in Sturridge's injury and Balotelli's gamble. I think we were lucky to get 6th out 
of the last season. In the ""RUN"" we were blessed with some magic from coutinho and hendo. These problems have been addressed 
nicely.

So in conclusion I'm more optimistic about seeing something like in 13/14 when we concede goals, but outscore the opponents.

No nation on earth need be accountable for people *leaving*... how many people are invading Southern Spain from the UK... is the UK supposed to stop them? No, because the concept of a 'nation state' can only exist within that nation state. The only reason airlines check passports before you board is to save them the cost of flying you back if you are rejected by the other nation you are trying to *get into*. If there was no cost or penalty, airlines wouldn't care who was boarding (as long as they were paying and weren't intending to cause terror).

France does not have the 'island mentality' that the British suffer from.

Ask a historian what caused the first world war and you'll get a long long answer covering thousands of topics. Ask the man in the street and you may well hear that a bloke called Archie Duke shot an ostrich 'cause he was hungry then it all kicked off.

The funny noise in your engine becomes something far more complex when a mechanic looks at it.

To think you can uncover any historical precedent for things taking place in modern politics now is to ignore the massive impact of things like globalisation and massive leaps forward in technology that have transformed all areas of life.

It's very sloppy thinking.

He uses a variety of linking words and markers (I would say; that’s a good question; as I said; as long as), but he overuses the filler (yeah) and sometimes referencing is inaccurate (for the one or the other reasons).

&gt;He uses a wide range of vocabulary, including some less common and idiomatic items and effective collocation (easy to blame; global warming; financial crisis; he stands for something; can’t stand the pressure). However, sometimes he lacks precision in his choice of words and expressions (Greek instead of ‘Greece’; on the other side of the lake; environmentally people/things; a big branch).

&gt;His grammar displays a good range of both simple and complex structures. Many of his sentences are error-free but he makes some mistakes in subject/verb agreement (people who wants; the people who admires him), articles (the normal person) and relative pronouns (everything what happens).

&gt;His pronunciation is clear and easy to follow. He uses both sentence stress and intonation effectively to convey meaning (you can’t blame a soccer player but it’s easy to blame the politicians). He does have a noticeable accent, however, and his mispronunciation of a few words results in occasional loss of clarity (wole model for ‘role model’; wong for ‘wrong’; serf the planet for ‘serve the planet’).

null,false,PoachTWC,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,null,"&gt;Wokey you got a relatively stress free job, have time to cook and relax and aren't bone tired when you get home. I have come home on some days, ordered takeaway and then slept because I was so tired. Like halfway through a mouthful. I once fell asleep taking a shower. 36 hours awake will do that to you.
It's simple for you but you may not realise other people don't have your job and your stresses or may not deal with them in a healthy way. Okay put it this way.

Meanwhile you have a very stressful job. *Far more people* in this country do what I do: 9 to 5 desk jobs. We're largely a nation of office workers these days. We commute into work, sit in work all day, and commute back home. That is the *typical British worker*.

I'm not the one lacking perspective here, you are: your job is unusually stressful, mine is entirely typical.

&gt;If quitting was that simple we would have no smokers, no alcoholics and no drug users.

Strawman. Not only are drugs massively different from food, I never said it was simple, I said it was **necessary**. Holds equally true for those above ailments.

&gt;Who says I paint it as acceptable? Do you know who people listen to when they say ""you are overweight? Is it A) Random Stranger in Gym or B) Doctor"" Hint. it's doctor.

Which goes back to my first point that you shouldn't be downplaying it because fat people take what doctors say and use it to pretend they can't fix their problem or that it isn't a problem at all. I've seen many a fat person hear a doctor say ""this medication may cause some weight gain"" to claim their runaway obesity is because of medicine alone. You're in a position of unquestioning authority on all things medical and lazy, ill-disciplined people will take *anything* you say that sounds like it can be an excuse as an excuse.

Again, I don't exercise. I'm never in a gym. Stop repeating that.

&gt;Who rationalised obesity? I understand why obesity occurs beyond the frankly simple answer. Saying ""endeavour to not eat so much"" is like shouting DODGE at a rugby player from the side lines.

You did:

&gt; I get it. Women (especially) have been forced to fit into a stereotype powered by anorexia and photo manipulation. If you aren't a stick you are a whale. So there is a backlash against the BMI.
Most of us aren't Usain Bolt or ""The Rock"", most of us are going to be under the aegis of the BMI. And it is a struggle to lose weight. i know. All the best things around us are high calorie. I just ate 4 biscuits and now have eaten 200 calories worth of food.
Portion sizes in restaurants are often massive, food's often eaten to the point of agony and we rely too much on pre-processed food and alcohol.

""It's not your fault, the media is portraying flasehoods, you're not an athlete and restaurants feed you too much!""

Bullshit. You don't need to be an athlete to be a healthy weight and it's not like restaurants force food down your neck. Media beauty standards are of course a problem but to claim unrealistic beauty standards is an excuse for obesity is frankly outrageous.

Excuses every one of them.

&gt;And you start by trying to not insult the people you are trying to help. Because if I called my patients tubby land whales they wouldn't want to engage with my ideas for say... community exercise. Or healthy ideas. Or trying to create online groups to support each other's weight loss in a healthy way that's not filled with super young people who got into crazy work outs.

There you go again! ""super young people who got into crazy work outs""? Fucking seriously? **You do not need to be a fitness freak to be a healthy weight**, stop, stop, **stop** repeatedly implying you need to exercise a lot to stay the right weight. This is *exactly* what I've got beef with you over. Everything you say is an excuse to avoid a healthy weight: ""Oh, I'm not one of those super young people, I guess it can't be helped...""

&gt;Do you know what puts fat people off from losing weight? The fact they are going to get judged by some guy. And the fact they are told that weight loss is easy. It is not. It is hard. It is easy for you cause you have done it. Knowing something is hard but worthwhile gets people to stick to the damn plan.
As I said. I have a pretty good record with this since I cannot operate on people who are obese and weight reduction is a major part of my treatment plans. Knowing how and why people overeat can allow you to use transference to things that are more productive. Or inculcate good habits.
Like ""hey I overeat every meal"". Okay. Drink a glass of water before your meal. Then use smaller dishes. This will help reduce what you eat. Don't binge if you have a meal outside. Once in a while those aren't bad. But get back on the diet immediately.
Shaming doesn't work as well as positive improvements towards a goal.

I don't advocate you *shaming* them. I advocate you stop presenting weight loss as difficult, as something only the ""super young people who got into crazy work outs"" can achieve, as something you need to confront that ""Random Stranger in Gym"" to realise.

If I were a fat lazy fuck looking for excuses to claim I can't ever be thin, your post was chock full of them. And you're a fucking *medical professional*, so your words have ultimate authority here.

null,false,The-Anchor,lfc68,,null,"Ian Doyle looks at the options in AM (attacking midfield). Given that Benteke is almost guaranteed to start against Stoke, who can play behind him?

Key points about the players raised (in the order listed in article): 

* Firmino: versatile across the front 3 &amp; has definitely shown his capability playing behind strikers but still very new. He hasn't yet been fully integrated into the team and could potentially be on different wavelengths to the rest of team/Benteke.

* Milner: has shown to be flexible for City playing in AM a few times but is best suited to a central midfield role, most likely alongside Henderson. Not to mention, he joined based on a guaranteed central midfield role. 

* Coutinho: reliable &amp; very good as he's repeatedly demonstrated for Liverpool in the past. Played across front three but best form of last season was when he played through the middle. Hopefully the competition for the role in the squad keeps pushing him to deliver good performances.

* Ibe: very exciting prospect &amp; fans have already placed the ""next/better than Sterling"" tag on him. Played well on the right in preseason but has only started 8 PL games. Inexperienced in that aspect and Rodgers must ensure it doesn't get too big for Ibe too soon. 

* Lallana: has shown glimpses of his talent and ability, especially in preseason. He was though, injured for most part of last season &amp; everytime he looked like he can deliver, got injured again, he has to step up. Looks more comfortable through the centre than on the left where he has played.

* Markovic: hasn't yet justified his price tag but his potential is visible. Looked to perhaps showcase that when he was played in the WB role mid season but games against Arsenal in the PL &amp; Villa in the FA cup didn't help his cause. He has to put in better performances consistently (granted that depends on how often he gets a chance).

null,false,quinn_drummer,null,null,null,"&gt; A pair of adequate running shoes is £15 - cheaper in a sale. They can lose the weight and do the country a favour, instead of eating Pizza Hut Twos-day Tuesdays every week

As always it's never quite as simple as that.  My mum has just had surgery due to her obesity.  They basically cut a chunk of the stomach out and ... well it's complicated and I don't really understand it myself, but it helps reduce/eliminate her diebetes so the NHS do it as preventative messure, something they can do now to prevent them having more serious and costly problems to deal with down the road.

Now, as to buying running shoes.  Intellectually my mum *knows* that eatting a healthy dinner and walking to the shops would do wonders to reducer her weight.  However, the food you eat affects your body in ways you wouldn't necessarily have thought.  It creates it's own sort of chemical balance, that for arguments sake may as well be called an addiction, which comes with all the  affects addictions have.

Not just this, but both her and her husband work long hard hours, both in the education sector and both for very little praise.  When they get home, it's late, their are tired and the last thing on their mind is cooking.  Now I know that's a bit of a shit excuse, and it is, but when you are physically drained in part because you're over weight, in part because you've had a long day, and your body is craving a kebab ... it's very very difficult to be rational and say no, I'll have pasta.

She also has depression, brought on by a lot of things, but couple this with her body being physically tired a lot, she spends a lot of her free time asleep in front of the TV.  Again, not something she is particularly proud of, but it's also not something that you can just decide to change, because there is several factors, some of which I've covered above, that affect the situation.

Finally, it's not as simple as just going for a run, because it's actually a difficult activity to get into, especially if you're over weight and if you haven't really done any physical activity in 20 years.

I myself have just started running a little, I'm not obese but I am a little overweight as around 13st.  I wanted to bring that down a bit so I bought some shoes and made a start.  Now I'm not really that unfit either.  I haven't smoked in 2 years, I generally eat healthy food and I play drums so I have plenty of stamina, but fuck me after 10 mins of running on my first day out I was dying for about an hour afterwards.

I really had to scale right back and start with really baby steps to get into it.  Even now, 2 months later, I can only just about manage 20mins, something I'm trying to push through.

Now imagine a middle aged 20st person doing that.  The would literally be trying to run before they can walk.  And, walking in itself is a tough job, no matter how much you may want to stroll down the shops.  Now my mum isn't that bad, she can walk places, but given the choice, would rather drive so she isn't out of breath when she gets there.

Anyway, hopefully all that will change now she's hard the surgery.  She's met people in support groups prior to having it down that had the same procedure and they say their life turned around over night, losing all their weight, losing their related illnesses, not being tired all the time, having the energy and motivation to do things they wouldn't have done before.

Sorry for the essay, but I quite often people write off being over weight to just general idolness, when in reality it's far more complicated than that and I wanted to set the record straight.",null,0,null,1438181153,null,0,false,0,ctkakjg,null,t3_3f0whp,null,t1_ctkakjg,null,t1_ctk9w15,null,null,null,1440156890,null,11,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,11,null

""4/5ths of women are jailed for 'non-violent' offences"" - yeah, and? If you assume for the moment that women have a lower rate of violent crime than men, what should that have to do with those remaining women who are found guilty of bona-fide non-violent crime. If women are less violent than men (assumption), then duh the prison population will be made of non-violent convicts. What's their point? That non-violent criminals shouldn't be in jail? That's a fair point in itself, but that's not a women's issue.

At any rate, to be jailed for a non-violent crime you have to really, *really* want to go to jail. They mention shop-lifting as an example non-violent crime that a lot of women go down for. The sentencing guidelines to win a 6-week stint in prison require the significant use of force causing damage, use of force **resulting in injury**, and a very high degree of planning (i.e. going in with a balaclava in a group with tools).

Or you could look at theft from a person - to end up in jail you have to demonstrate a significant degree of violent threats, or purposefully targeting vulnerable people and ultimately making off with significantly valuable goods.

null,false,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,null,"&gt; What would you suggest the state could do to tackle the causes here?

Here are some suggestions:

* Introduce/increase VAT on unhealthy food items. This could include cake, which does not have VAT on it at the moment.

* Have a ""month of healthy eating"" event, in partnership with supermarkets, lifestyle magazines and TV channels. Cooking shows would be expected to make healthy food, a free recipe leaflet containing a few cheap and easy healthy recipes could be distributed via the Royal Mail and/or supermarkets, that sort of thing.

* Encourage more walking. The government could subsidise a TV show about woodland walks (a 30-minute weekly thing maybe, going to a different locality each time, showing the route, showing what you'd see on the walk in terms of wildlife and flora, talking with locals, etc)

* Introduce a scheme like the ""Global Corporate Challenge"" (a 100-day challenge to walk 10,000 steps per day, done in teams of up to 7) that is more open to everyone, and perhaps less daunting (5,000 steps a day, perhaps), and maybe with some sort of community aspect, like having forums for regions and towns etc.

* Improve public transport. Rarely does public tranport take people door to door, they've got to walk to and from bus stops and train stations. If public transport was more reliable, cheaper and more comfortable, more people would do it, and thus more people would get more walking into their daily routine.

null,false,cbfw86,,Corbyn for Leader of the Opposition,null,"&gt;The middle classes are meritocratic because that's how many of them go there.

Middle class people are, by and large, middle class because they worked hard to get and stay ahead of the competition. Not all white collar service workers are the children of bankers, doctors and lawyers. Triaging the population based on earnings is stupid but doesn't change the fact that that's how it's done most of the time, if not all the time. The middle classes are middle class because they worked to get there, and now dislike having to pay for chavs to be chavs, while the prudent stay financially stable through trift and industry. That should have been clear from my first sentence.

&gt;If their too short sighted/blinded by hate to see what's happening maybe.

Or maybe you're too blinded by idealism and any excuse to shout at other people to see that people only get fat because they consume more energy than they burn. If the diets of the poor are unhealthy because they're buying ready meals of processed food then they can fucking well learn to cook fresh produce and go for a motherfucking run three times a week. Not get heart disease on the dole and expect other people to pay for the surgery. After they've already paid for all the food.

That said, I don't think this is about idealism, I think this is about attempting to reduce the projected burdens to be placed on healthcare and other public services as a result of people getting fatter and fatter. New Labour spent 13 years using cash as an incentive for change by throwing money at everything. The Tories do the opposite. I don't see this as an arbitrary reduction of a group of persecuted victims.

UKIP was founded in 1991 by the historian Alan Sked as the Anti-Federalist League, a single-issue Eurosceptic party. That is its roots, not in libertarianism. In fact Sked is now a member of The New Deal, a much more left leaning anti EU party.

The Anti-Federalist League was renamed UKIP in 1993 and the party adopted a wider right-wing platform. It wasn't until Farage took over in 2009 that they took a libertarian slant on things, although academic political scientists categorise them as right-wing populism. You can't be truly libertarian and socially conservative.

It is still disingenuous to call UKIP libertarian if you consider being socially conservative not in direct conflict with being a libertarian. They generally have [5 factions](http://www.conservativehome.com/highlights/2014/12/the-five-tribes-of-ukip.html), of which only one would call itself libertarian, and two are left leaning.

Absolutely. I recently had a cut in income and food has been the biggest area where we've reduced spending. And I was surprised how easy it was to do, even while still eating a lot of the things we like (including some unhealthy things like pizza and chips). It is really easy to cook for under £1 per person per meal, especially without meat; I think my cheapest meals have been in the 30-40p range, including things like home-made bread and home-made soups. Onion soup for two takes two onions, one stock cube, water, and a bit of salt, and the ingredients therefore cost about 30p. Carrot soup is similar. Anything with standard white rice is really cheap. Tomato pasta sauce of supermarket own brand varieties (especially Aldi) are cheap. Potatoes are cheap, and there's loads you can do with them including jackets, chips, mash, boiled, rostis, as filler in soups and stews.

null,false,gamas,,Labour Member,null,"The interesting thing is, his answer is still the most honest answer (as the answer amounts to ""He is good at doing what he does so I would at least consider it an option"").

Of course, given ultimately he wants to bring back shadow cabinet elections, it could also be interpreted as he wouldn't pick Ed as he would like the members to decide, but he would hope Ed would get involved.

But yeah, it's a very sneaky tactic, he made himself look like he was answering the question in the affirmative, whilst actually just pointing out that it would be a nuanced decision that he couldn't answer in the affirmative.

He has done this more recently with the EU referendum issue in fact. When pressed about whether he would be campaigning against UK membership, he said 

&gt;Labour should set out its own clear position to influence negotiations, working with our European allies to set out a reform agenda to benefit ordinary Europeans across the continent. We cannot be content with the state of the EU as it stands. But that does not mean walking away, but staying to fight together for a better Europe.

Which the media and various pressure groups have breathed a sigh of relief thinking he just committed to being in the Yes campaign (due to the ""fight together for a better Europe"" part""), when he actually said nothing more about the EU referendum than what he said previously (that he supports the free movement of people and the goal of peace in Europe, but that the EU needs reform to ensure it cannot be used as a tool for hurting people, and if it is clear we can't get that reform then we should consider whether the EU actually benefits Europe.""

As I said elsewhere, this trait is a bit of a double-edged sword as on one the negative side it risks the media and voters interpretting Corbyn as a flip-flopper even though he is literally holding the position he always had. On the other hand, managing to appear to have a more favourable position whilst actually holding a more nuanced position is a pretty handy skill to have given the task he will have is convincing a right-wing electorate that we should take left-wing policies.",null,0,null,1438182786,null,0,1438183080,0,ctkbopc,null,t3_3ew0sx,null,t1_ctkbopc,null,t1_ctkaq30,null,null,null,1440157416,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

Really? The way I see it I'm middle class, because my parents were middle class and I have had little advantages over poorer people that over my whole life have added up to me staying ahead. Perhaps I'm just narcissistic enough to give myself all the credit. 

I don't see what class has got to do with it though. I earn a decent wage but I'm not immune from losing my job or getting ill, and if I do the last thing I want is being told I'm going to be left destitute because of my BMI. It's an incredibly stupid idea.

The whole rest of your post seems to be based on the idea everyone on benefits is some fat permanently unemployed slob, and nobody in work is overweight or obese. I don't know where your getting this skewed view from, some sort of right-wing propaganda of a trim hard-working middle class and a fat lazy underclass, it's not based in reality.

null,false,quinn_drummer,null,null,null,"&gt;  but your argument basically amounts to 'food is an addiction'

No, my point is that there are a combination of factors that all have an affect.  And this is just one specific instance, everyone will be different.  I applaud that you were able to work to reduce your weight, and whilst I'm not saying that this isn't possible for everyone, I'm saying it can be extremely difficult and depends on the individual.

And I only addressed the personal circumstances of my mum.  We haven't even begun to discuss societies involvement. The first being that we live in a consumer society with a heavy focus on service ... we have become a nation with 16 fastfood restaurants on every high street and advertisements everywhere (which play a subtle yet vital role in the decisions people make), not to mention microwave meals and ready meals and pre-made pizzas and convience food at every turn of the isle with very little to disuade us from buying it.

Education plays an important role, and you can see why Jamie Oliver went around trying to stop schools from serving turkey twizzlers for lunch.  Access to sports facilities from a young age is also key, yet we're not a nation that real seems to value exercise as there is no money in it.

The goverment are selling off school fields, cancelling school sports partnership and re-directing money from schools and areas that would benefit for sports programs and community health centres and giving it to private schools because 35% of medal winners at the olympics were privately educated (despite only 7% of kids going to private schools).

There is money in selling a kids an x-box game and having them stay in doors playing it all day.  There is no money in selling 1 child a football that 20 of them can play with at the park all day, so this brings us back to advertising again.

So anyway, that's just another few examples of structures on society affect peoples beahaviour and decisions.  Because when it comes down to it, the decisions we make just navigate the structures that are in place around us (which I have an essay on if you want to read it)

So no, it's not just about food addiction, it's a multitude of everything, that some manage to overcome, a lot don't. And removing benefits will do absolutely fuck all to resolve it.

null,false,pinotage1972,null,null,null,"My perspective is that image rights would NOT be part of the transfer fee.   

There was a tribunal several years go involving Arsenal and Berkamp/Platt, in which the British government was investigating whether 'image rights' payments were being used to avoid paying taxes.  

During this, it was determined and I believe the ruling is still followed, that image rights are separate from registration rights and salary.    So, a transfer fee is negotiated between the clubs for the registration rights, and between the buying club for the player (or his agent) for a playing contract.   

Image Rights are separate, and Premier League clubs generally purchase these from the player:  this is because you don't want to have to pay a player for every time you sell a shirt with their name on it, or post a picture on your website or promo materials.   

While 3rd party registration rights are banned by the English FA, and therefore Premier League, 3rd party image rights are not, and most teams actually lease out or have a 3rd party deal with the image rights that they own.  

Sometimes a player has such a high profile that they continue to own their own image rights, as David Beckham did after he left United (it was a driving factor in his leaving the club, due to the potential value of his image rights, which was proven correct in the long run, he made a fortune from them).

http://www.postmatch.org/251/ronaldo-beckham-aguero-football-image-rights/

&gt; As he runs towards the crowd barriers there are large groups of camera men lined up and down the sideline who all take numerous photos of him – dozens of camera shutters clicking open and closed many times a second. That image of Aguero running down the sideline will be captured hundreds of times and relayed all the way around the world for months and years to come. It will grace the covers of newspapers, magazines, DVD’s, billboards, on the side of busses, in train stations – everywhere.

&gt;It will also be used in other campaigns that form a major part of international sports – to market the products produced by sponsors. Aguero has sponsors like Puma that pay him a lot of money (£5M for 3 years), so how do Manchester City, the Premier League, television stations, newspapers and other sponsors use the image of his goal celebration for free while some sponsors pay good money for the same rights? The short answer is that he is paid for all use of his image rights in the same way sponsors pay him. His club pay him an additional fee on top of his salary that includes all of these uses, while the topic is broad and complicated, it is often referred to as “image rights”.

&gt;In common law juristictions an image right is defined as a property owned and controlled by a person. It is the right of a person to own, control and administer his or her own image. Image rights for a person are similar to what a trademark is for a logo or name, or a copyright for an artistic work. In the same way that you can’t violate the copyright by claiming a movie or song as your own, with image rights you can’t claim an endorsement or ownership of a persons image without their permission.",null,0,null,1438184252,null,0,false,0,ctkcpui,null,t3_3f0rdo,null,t1_ctkcpui,null,t1_ctkcerg,null,null,null,1440157902,null,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3,null

my point is that £300 per day for expenses is ridiculous. what reasonable expenses could you have were you need £300 per day?
especially when you live just down the road and dont need to pay for a hotel for example. 

£1500 per week? most people dont earn that from their salary in a month

this is clearly not the worst excess by any stretch, and some sort of expenses payment is obviously appropriate, but £300 per day is just ridiculous

""Most members of the Lords do not receive a salary for their parliamentary duties but are eligible to receive allowances and, within certain limits, the travel expenses they incur in fulfilling their parliamentary duties.

Members who are not paid a salary may claim a flat rate attendance allowance of £150 or £300 for each sitting day they attend the House. This daily allowance replaces the separate overnight subsistence, day subsistence and office costs in the previous system. Entitlement is determined by attendance, not residence criteria.""

from: http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-allowances/

the vast majority of peers have residences in london, so they replaced an expense scheme designed to pay for hotels etc, with one that they all qualify for regardless

edit : formatting and....

http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-finance-office/2014-15/allowances-expenses-2014-15-month-11-February-2015.pdf

this pdf shows the claims themselves - you can see that many peers actual make further claims for travel etc on top of this daily allowance

for example, Lord Alton of Liverpool attended 14 days, claimed the full £4200 daily expenses plus a further £1078 'attendance travel costs' plus £959 'rail/car/coach' - another travel catagory and another £95 for taxis and parking

so, for 14 days attendance, the tax payer has forked out over £6000

£6000 for one peer to attend for 14 days

there is no way that this can possibly be considered to represent anything like value for money

But I don't want them here. We've got enough of our own problems without taking on other countries problems. The social impact of uneducated African immigration on the UK, to me, would be significant. 

Hearing about Muslim Africans throwing Christian Africans off boats, or other such culturally backwards shit doesn't make me want to open my arms and welcome them into my country that has enough social problems as is. 

Inviting them into the country is not something I can even feign enthusiasm about. 

I'm all for any initiative that helps stabilize or bring job opportunities (lets face it, most are economic migrants now) to their home countries. Those are actual solutions to this problem. Letting them in wholesale, is not. 

Send humanitarian aid to camp sites in Calais, give foreign aid money to countries struggling. Anything but letting them in. 

We can't set a precedent on this, or it'll be the end of us. 

If I was convinced that all these refugees wouldn't just concentrate themselves in one area and shit it up I might be more open to the idea. But I'm not convinced of that. There's plenty of case studies to show that's exactly what happens.

I used to be a big time soccer fan in the late 1990's. But then after we moved to the United States my interest slowly waned because it was never shown here. I was a big AC Milan fan back then. But around 2010 my interest peaked again due to a combination of Fifa and the World Cup. For a while I couldn't really find a team. Argentina has ALWAYS been my team since 1990, my entire life. So I saw that Man City had both Tevez and Aguero, and for me that was enough. Later I found out they also had Zabaleta and that was just icing on the cake as far as I was concerned. Next season I started cheering hard, and even though they didn't win anything I was kind of emotionally set from that point on. I was very sad when Tevez left. But then they brought Demichelis and I was like ""hey at least they are trying"" lol. Now we have Caballero, Zucculini as well. Lot's of Argentina players. At this point though even if they all left I would still cheer for Man City I'm already commited. I hate Chelsea, Arsenal, Manure and the rest. I couldn't see myself cheering for anyone else. 

Edit: Made it sound like I didn't care about Zabaleta. I actually didn't realize what a big and important player he was until I started watching Man City. The strikers get a ton of attention.

The fix for it is to replace the stock one for a manual tensioner, which you can get for about 30 quid.

Other than that, look at the usual stuff, any fluid leaks, oil leaks on the forks. Give the exhaust a quick touch too if you can before the seller starts the bike. If it's hot, it's possible the bike may have been run beforehand to hide any cold start problems, generally carb related.

The Lords has a unique constitutional position, in that peers are not elected and they're not easily sacked. Being a member of the Lords is supposed to be an honour - before membership they have to be approved by a scrutiny committee who establish that they're upstanding and of good moral character and all that.

That's why the £300 per day *isn't* a wage - one is appointed to the Lords as an honour, for the honour of serving the public, and the rate is only supposed to cover expenses. It would be regarded as wasteful and bureaucratic to require gentlemen of such stature to collect and file receipts for such petty amounts, so that's why it's a flat rate.

The £300 is supposed to cover the cost of commuting down from your Yorkshire estate for an important vote or committee meeting, and lunch somewhere decent.

As an example. I am happy for the party with the most seats to be in power. As long as those seats are selected in a proportional way.

If you demand that a party has to have 50%+ of seats to have power then no party will ever have power and every decision will either be a negotiation, or as part of a coalition.

The questions are actually quite different, i.e.

(1) Do you think that the seats in parliament should be assigned in a method that better represents the popular vote?

and

(2) Do you think that there should be a requirement for a majority before a party can have control of parliament?

They are related, in the sense that currently it is possible to have over 50% of the seats without 50% of the vote.

A lot of places will take you if you can show a kickass portfolio even if you don't have a degree. Failing that you might consider trying to become a content writer  for websites but a lot of those positions that my company uses are freelance which sucks imo but might get you experience to get something decent later. 

(basically writing everything that appears on a website, it is quiet involved sometimes, like you really have to understand the company or topic you are writing about, large companies will normally write it internally but lots of small businesses will contract it out, contact website development companies and introduce yourself as a freelance content writer and don't produce shit and you will probably get plenty referrals and hopefully you can use that as experience to get some sort of marketing job, no clue if that would work though. I am just going on what happens at my work, we refer all our clients the same few content writers)

Social Media manager is another option that we at least don't require a qualification for but fair warning that is far more involved than it sounds.

The League was more difficult to consume then, but now with all the games on TV in the States, watching every Villa game became simple.  They stream it on apps for mobile viewing too.  With a little one at home who wakes with the sun, having a game on in the background Saturday mornings is 1000X better than some crappy cartoon or whatever shit Disney is forcing us to watch.

*""UK GDP growth is created due to our increase in population, it doesn't mean we're getting any richer. If the German population had increased at the same rate as the UK post crisis it would be way way higher than the UK at the moment. Since 2009 the German population has actually decreased by 1 million while ours has increased by 5 million. This inevitably means we will eventually catch Germany up in terms of nominal GDP (we're projected to be the most populous country in Europe by 2050). It doesn't suggest we will become as rich as Germany however, since 2009 (lowest point) our per capita GDP (PPP) has increased by 4.9% while in Germany it has increased by 11.4%. This while suffering through a Eurozone crisis. In the first three years Germany saw growth of 8% while the UK saw growth of 1.9%.""*

So at least with a comparison with Germany we're still not caught up. This is likely not the case with our other EZ counterparts however. France saw much greater growth in the years after the crash but we have surpassed them now (France has only grown a measly 2.8% since the crash in terms of GDP per capita (PPP)). America have grown by 7.3% since the crash if anyone was wondering. The Eurozone as a whole still has not recovered from 2009, they are still below 2009 level in terms of per capita GDP (PPP).

Much of north london is linked to itself but not to the rest of london bar west, obviously the more central you go the more expensive it is. Battersea, clapham and fulham/hammersmith are areas where in the right parts it's pretty cheap but also feel safe to live/arent intimidating at night.    
Those areas are all great for travel, having links to most other regions of london by one tube or 2 buses.

General advice:

1. Get an oyster card, and if youre traveling a lot look into monthly pay unlimited bus or tube travel as this can be a big saver.
2.  Check tube service before you go anywhere using it, nothing worse than getting to your tube station to find the whole line is down for maintenance.
3.  If you're from more northern england, bare in mind day to day London folk are a lot less friendly/willing to interact with strangers (I am from London and go to Uni in the north and was quite shocked at the difference)
4.  If you like pubs, scope out all the locals and give them each a try, prices may vary massively and atmospheres will often be vastly different.

Bare in mind two thirds of men and over half of women in this country are overweight or obese. How easy is it going to be to sanction people because for one week they haven't lost weight, or not a sufficient amount of weight. The job centers already have sanction targets, think about how much easier this is going to make it for them. Think also about the health risks of poverty, not being able to afford to heat your home, and homelessness. All these are possible effects of sanctions and far bigger risk than being slightly overweight. How many children are going to suffer because there mum's to fat? How many couples will because one of them can't lose enough weight? This is a nasty and draconian measure that will only increase the suffering of those worst off.

&gt; I think it's more the amount of food rather than the food itself

It's both, but you can get over your daily calories in biscuits and sugary drinks for example and it won't fill you up and it will cost you less than a pound. The fact is we have hugely calorific food available hugely cheaply. It's cheaper to eat unhealthily than healthily, so making people poorer is not a solution (unless you make them so poor they can't afford food at all, because they can't afford anything at all).",null,0,null,1438192032,null,0,1438192682,0,ctkigze,null,t3_3f0whp,null,t1_ctkigze,null,t1_ctkffg5,null,null,null,1440160679,null,5,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,5,null

No and we could sit here all day listing all sorts of people he didn't say he may try to encourage into politics.  Until he comes out and says outright he won't try to get working class MPs, any assumptions about it is pure speculation.

For all the reasons DM Cullen explains, he's a commodity for the club. Clearly, he's useful for the club and its marketing strategy, no matter what he contributes to the first team during his time at Spurs.

So I imagine when Spurs made this deal, they thought ""Ok, his value to our brand alone is worth $X million. If we can sign him for a number less than that, we can't lose.""

Whether he'll actually get in the first team at all for Tottenham, whether this season or in the future, is a moot point as it relates to this article. We can simply infer that Yedlin is helping the club in one way or another.

I think it's a shame that the player has been saddled with this tag of ""American brand ambassador."" It can't be helpful for his mindset as a player.

Your company may ask you to fill in a form for self certification but this is at their discretion. 

In any case, you have sent this note from your GP into work and it states no return date, therefore I assume it also doesn't state any period, i.e ""I recommend this person should rest for 3 days"".

Depending on how cuntish your work are I wouldn't bother going back in until Monday, based upon the self certification rule.

null,false,Geisterkrieg,,Labour Member,null,"&gt; Attlee, like every Labour leader to win an election, was on the right wing of the party of his day.

You've claimed this elsewhere, but what exactly do you mean by this? If you're saying Attlee was a Gaitskellite, well, he wasn't -- he was certainly closer to Gaitskell than Bevan, and voted for him in 1955, but he also often had pretty rancorous relations with the right wing of the party in general, particularly figures like Morrison. Attlee was the closest thing to a centre the party had at the time, and is fairly well-known for his refusal to join a particular Labour tribe.

The 1945 manifesto is widely acknowledged both now and at the time to have been a genuinely radical document drawing on a broad range of policies from the left of the party (as the political historian Martin Francis says, ""Labour [in 1945] did not retreat into pragmatism or tamely capitulate to the pre-existing social establishment""). Similarly, it's difficult to imagine Attlee having given Bevan such wide-ranging responsibility if he were really on the definite right-wing -- imagine a PM Kendall allowing Corbyn to set up his National Education Service!",null,0,null,1438195139,null,0,false,0,ctkktgf,null,t3_3f1b6p,null,t1_ctkktgf,null,t1_ctkgwki,null,null,null,1440161784,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

There aren't any hidden charges or costs - as long as the full amount is paid off by the 6 or 12 month mark, you won't pay anything more than what you paid for it. 

You have to be super on the ball though - you **must** take the initiative to pay off some of the bill each month on their website. It's a good idea to calculate the total amount against your scheme - what's the bare minimum you'd have to pay each month to pay it off in time? And is that amount realistic in your budget for that length of time? Fortunately how much you pay each month is variable, so if your income varies then you can either pay a little more or less depending, but you *must* be able to make a minimum to get that bill cleared. 

All in all it's a very good scheme as long as you do your homework properly, ensure that its a realistic addition to your monthly expenditures, and have the discipline to pay Argos each month!

This allowed Skrtel to remain in his comfort zone as a deep, covering defender which, in turn, allowed Mig to remain in his comfort zone as a relatively conservative goalkeeper.

To me, the distinctive feature of our diamond was having two mobile forwards stay forward and drift into the channels as the opposition pushed their fullbacks forward. This is what allowed us to be so devastating on the counterattack, though it naturally led to our defence being more exposed and the team having to pursue a you-score-3-we'll-score-4 strategy.

You've earned them by saying that.

I love peoples logic in that if he isn't pushing players like Clyne (who was available for a bargain given his contract situation) at 22 then we should sell him. 

A 22 year old playing at premier league level and performing extremely well at 20 on loan in the championship should just be tossed to the curb. 

What is the actual point in selling a good young defender because he isn't starting in a top 5 team at 22? Ridiculous.

You're saying that Northern Irish unionists lost, which is true. They were forced to concede some political power to the nationalist minority. That's not the same as the IRA winning, since the aims were not symmetric. The IRA wanted a united Ireland, and didn't get it. Loyalists wanted to shut catholics out of public life in Northern Ireland, and didn't get that. The British government wanted to carry on being in charge of the whole show, and they got that. 

There weren't two sides to this conflict, but three. The story of the war is that the British slowly, over 25 years or so, learned how to shut down Republican paramilitary activity, while also learning how to manage Unionist opinion to where they found it increasingly difficult to veto political change. From the fall of Terence O' Neill, through Sunningdale, Hillsborough, and finally the GFA, Loyalist rejectionism slowly lost it's ability to halt progress.

Britain won. Republicans didn't achieve their major war aim, but gained some concessions to political fairness, at the expense of Northern Irish loyalists losing some of their privileges.",null,0,null,1438197913,null,0,1438198200,0,ctkmwqj,null,t3_3f1hj9,null,t1_ctkmwqj,null,t1_ctki5xh,null,null,null,1440162835,null,9,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,9,null

And no one thought Redknapp was an idiot for saying it at the time. It was a completely reasonable thought.

The guy went from being a solid up and coming talent to one of the world's best in the span of a single season. It'd be like if Martin Kelly had never gotten injured, got reasonable game time, was occasionally talked about as a solid contender to be in the team for a good long time, and then was all of a sudden getting the attention of Real Madrid and banging in goals from midfield.

Any U.S. metropolitan area has a large Hispanic population, and Barca is a favorite among many people from that background. The main chant was ""Barca, [CHELSEA] Barca, [CHELSEA]!"" Chelsea fans held their own, though, and it was great to see a large American football stadium sell out for a soccer match, and as an America that's really exciting. 

I talked to so many people who never watched soccer until a few years ago when they saw a highlight of Hazard or a Champions league match, and that paved the way to becoming huge fans of Chelsea and the sport in general.
