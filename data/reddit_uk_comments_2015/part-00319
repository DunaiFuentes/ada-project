null,null,mastican42,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,null,"I've always thought it was more a case of 'who watches the watchmen?' kind of scenario. Young people will be young people and cry freedom without knowing what they mean but it's more a case of that power is perfectly acceptable if not misused, like any power. Keeping it in check is what the sensible people who argue against are worried about. How can we be sure that it's not just surveillance? How do we know that information won't be used to either identify us uniquely in the case of a central government security lapse or worse, be used in a process of social engineering? Even the narrative of ""you have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide"" is perfectly correct on a basic level. The problem is that the world isn't that basic and while there are people who don't want the government to watch them because they are doing something wrong there are plenty who just want to live in peace, even passive peace without fear of sudden reprimand. It's a more difficult issue than either side wants to admit.

Heck I'm young and I feel sorry for whatever government official may or may not be looking at my internet history but I don't really see it as a privacy issue; I'm not doing anything that would get me prosecuted but may turn heads. If it was released to the public, I'd have a problem with it simply because vices are vices and people are entitled to those. If the information was anonymous except in the situation of a criminal case then fair enough for the most part, I'm not necessarily for or against surveillance but anybody committing a crime serious enough to warrant that kind of power won't be dumb enough to put it on facebook or even private messages thus negating the whole point of it in the first place - it will also only lead to evolution of criminal techniques. Nothing drives evolution like selection pressure after all and that applies to everything. The need to survive doing something will lead to ever more innovative ways of hiding it from whoever may be watching.",null,0,null,1439878045,null,null,1439878702,0,cu6sbjb,null,t3_3hbjs7,null,null,null,t1_cu5zgcc,null,null,null,1441317420,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,Phatnev,null,null,null,"That's why I metioned evolution, Terry isn't going to be around forever and it won't happen overnight. When it's Zouma/Cahill or Zouma/Stones a high(er) line will be much more feasible. I'm not saying we'll play just like Barcelona, but I think a higher line is important in controlling the game against lesser opponents, creating pressure against some better sides or when we go down. I don't think both CBs need to be astoundingly quick, the fullbacks being good in possession while remaining defensively minded is equally as important. 

I don't think he has ever played a truly high line, he's usually stuck to the sit back and counter approach. His first stint here we played 4-3-3 or more aptly a 4-1-2-3. The CBs and holding mid together as a unit, the fullbacks charged with contributing to offense but not at the expense of sound defense. This works most of the time but we've seen us struggle to score against smaller sides. Again I think this as much to do with formation as it does other factors.

I think Roman will push for more impressive football, and I think the higher line is part of that. Sure we'll still sit back against Barca and Bayern, but those type of games make up roughly 15% of our fixtures. Adaptability is key. We need to find a balance between Jose's defensive tactics and Ancelotti's offensive onslaught. We lack the ability to switch between the two at this point due to lack of depth, and that will hamstring us.

null,null,grahampeterclark,null,null,null,"&gt; First of all - with my income/savings, is buying a house within the next year or so doable for me?

If you have a deposit of ¬£30k, you have 33% deposit and hence a LTV of 67%. By the time you use some of that ¬£30k for your legal expenses, surveys, etc, you'll be left with a LTV of around 70%, which will be ¬£63k (for examples sake).

On the stress test for monthly income vs expenses, they will be looking for a positive net monthly position after your mortgage payment stressed at their standard variable rate + 3% or so, which may be around 8%.

Based on a 25 year repayment, that would be ¬£470ish per month. To be on the safe side, call it ¬£500. Therefore, if all of your other monthly expenses (council tax, insurance, groceries, gym, household items, loan repayments, everything...) come to less than ¬£800 you should be okay for their affordability checks.

I ended up working there as well as a guide for a while, retelling the tale of where the rocking horse came from and I could point to Stewart's house on the Coiti opposite. It was right next to my house too.

null,null,DearTereza,null,null,null,"So you have a deposit that's a third of the property value, and a salary that's a third of the remaining money you need on mortgage? You're in a great position then. Realistically a few grand in buffer money for the various fees (you won't need to pay any stamp duty at that price, so just legal/conveyancing and agency fees and some cash for initial expenses).

It's worth checking out the Loan to Value (LtV) bands for the banks that you're considering, as if you can get into a lower band you'll get a much lower interest rate. The smaller the loan is compared to the total value of the property, the lower risk you present to the bank, so the lower rate you'll pay on the debt. Many banks have bands at 75 or 60-5% or so. Sometimes saving a little more can help move you to the next band and save you many thousands in interest over the life of the mortgage. 

Consider getting a good, impartial IFA/mortgage broker to help navigate all this. Many of them don't charge buyers for first mortgages, but do your research on the adviser and make sure they're 100% clear on how they're getting paid, and provide all the mandatory Key Facts sheets.

null,null,camlawson24,null,null,null,"Splashing on three players in the closing stages of the window would seem like overkill, at least to me. No central defender is going to get significant time here this season with Terry, Cahill, and Zouma here, not to mention Ivanovic now freed up to cover at CB if need be with Baba in. Stones would be great for the future but would he significantly increase our title chances *this* season? I can't see how.

Another world-class CM would be incredible but how many of those are available at this point in time? How many would be willing to ride the bench when we start Matic and Fabregas against non-contenders? Would we be willing to switch to a 4-3-3 to accommodate another CM or would Fabregas be pushed forward permanently?

An attacking mid to displace Willian as a game-in, game-out starter would be nice but again -- how many of those are for sale for a reasonable price right now? We already have a gluttony of players that can play on the wing or as attacking mids between Hazard, Fabregas, Oscar, Willian, Moses, Ramires, etc. I can't see the logic in buying another one unless they are a substantial upgrade.

I'm just struggling to imagine 3 realistic, prudent signings at this point in the window and with things as they currently are. Coming off the season we just had and with the wealth of talent we have on loan and in the youth system, it seems hasty to splash big cash on 3 players right now.

Secondly, check out thetrainline.com and nationalrail.co.uk for routes and tickets. Whenever possible book well in advance for the cheapest tickets. 

Thirdly, you may be able to find a route which goes via Birmingham New Street but my quick check suggests tickets via this route could be a lot more expensive than going through London.  So, between London and Cambridge... I am currently commuting between London and Cambridge (and have been for 6 weeks) so I know this route well. You have two choices: Northern trains into Kings Cross or Abellio Greater Anglia trains into Liverpool Street. By and large Northern trains to Kings Cross are faster and more comfortable than trains to Liverpool Street, but you pay for it. Advance singles to Liverpool Street are in the ¬£9-¬£13 range; tickets via Kings Cross are more like ¬£20. And the fast trains to Liverpool Street are comfortable and are comparable to Northern trains in terms of travel duration.

My advice would be to see about splitting the journey into two parts. Get yourself to London via Liverpool Street and then get a separate ticket between Paddington and Bristol. Whilst in London use a contactless payment card or get an Oyster card. Don't be tempted to buy the travel card with your national rail tickets as that's unnecessarily expensive, unless you decide to exit the tube network for some shopping or sight seeing.  

For Friday 28th of August there's a 1hr10 min train between Cambridge and Liverpool Street at 10:04, which would cost ¬£9. Northern trains to Kings Cross are ¬£23. 

Note: just before I sent this message I decided to look for returns between Cambridge and Bristol and it looks on first inspection that breaking the journey down could end up making it more expensive. ¬£67 could well be the cheapest option, and that's going via Kings Cross.

null,null,RushsMustache,lfc93,,null,"He wasn't great in the first half last night, he stifled some of the forward momentum and was fairly static at times. When he dropped into midfield to replace Henderson he and Milner initially both pushed too far forward leaving Can exposed in his defensive duties. 

There were some small positives from him by the end of the game; he had tempered his natural urges and was sat a little deeper, making some decent interceptions and tackles. However he's never really going to feel natural or excel in such a position. 

He has looked poor in the last two games at AM but I think that might be more of a consequence of the players and the formation; both he and Ibe are best when running with the ball at players, they aren't great at making runs to pull away defenders. With Henderson and Milner having to sit deeper in a 4231, we've only really had Coutinho and Benteke making good runs off the ball  to open up space for Lallana and Ibe to exploit.

Having said that, if we are to persist with the 4231 then I'd support both Lallana and Ibe being dropped to try something different; Firmino and Markovic when both are fit maybe. Other than that we'd need to change formation to 433 and again neither of them would warrant a place based on recent performances. Will be interesting to see what happens at Arsenal.

I have doubts about this. For one thing, I think some on the hard left will still see Labour's brand as tainted, or just decide they prefer the Greens or SNP for other ideological reasons. I think Corbyn is not reactionary enough to appeal to many of the Kippers' baser instincts as well.

More than that, one has to recognise that a single swing voter is twice as useful as a fringe supporter. How so? Because a fringe supporter adds a single vote to your cause. A swing voter not only adds that vote, but subtracts it from the opposition. Therefore I think it's probably not true than the fringe voters will ""more than replace"" the swingers.

null,null,asyoulikeitnow,null,null,null,"I find it telling that you assume that all that single market legislation is is just setting standards. It is much more than this, and you have already failed to grasp my mention of the EEA's acceptance of social policy as well. Replies like this often portray a fundamental misunderstanding of global bodies as well. These bodies operate by countries grouping together with like minded representatives to secure reforms. The UK retains representation and a vote in these fora and is doubly represented by the EU. Common texts will be built up by simple majority votes with unanimity being necessary for final adoption. However, this isn't legislation, but merely a broad and very open set of guidelines, with no real means of enforcement, in most cases. Bodies, like the EU firstly maximise our chance of securing the broad aims we want, and then flesh out these aims into tangible legislation, setting the political direction and making them enforceable. 

Now what you are effectively saying is that we would be be better to accept fleshed out legislation orgiginating from the EU via the EEA with no direct input simply because we had some vague say in setting some very broad and non specific aims it had as guidelines, rather than be directly involved in both stages.

Again, as someone with a careers worth of experience in dealing with these matters I think you should turn your attention to the BASEL III accords negotiated at a high level by jurisdictions and then fleshed out into legislation by each jurisdiction. Switzerland and the EEA were left pitifully writing letters to the EU asking them to refrain from certain provisions that were included in the Capital Requirements Directive/Legislation as they possesses no MEPs or Council reps to table amendments directly.

null,null,grahampeterclark,null,null,null,"It's a tough one. The difference in the interest rates for the three products model the banks' expectation of what interest rates will do over that time. The ""risk"" is also built into these rates (i.e. the 3.29% is higher than it would normally be because the bank have to add a few extra 0.1%s in order to mitigate the fact that they don't know what will happen over the next 5 years).

Therefore, because it's already built into the price, I personally tend to opt for the shorter term fixes, with the plan to remortgage every two years on a new introductory offer. 

One thing to consider, which I think will be important is the current spread is high in my opinion. For example, the banks borrow at a current base rate of 0.5%, but lend on a 2 year fix at 2.15%. 

I personally believe that due to future increases in competition and technology advances in this market, we'll see this spread between base rate and lending rates fall. Therefore, when (if) the base rate goes up to 0.75%, I'm not sure that the 2 year fix will automatically follow suit and reach 2.4% in your example.

Because of all this, I personally opt for the 2 year fix at 2.15%. However, maybe in two years time, the base rate is 2% and banks are charging 4% for their 2 year fixed rates and you'd be laughing if you'd taken out the 3.29% rate.

One final way to look at it is by taking an example.

If you take out a 25 year ¬£100k mortgage on the five year fixed rate (with an assumed SVR of 4.5% after), then your payments would be ¬£534pm.

If you took out the same 25 year ¬£100k mortgage on the two year fixed rate (with an assumed SVR of 4.5% after year 5), then to have the same ¬£534pm payment, you'll need your interest rate between year 3 and 5 (a 3 year fixed taken out when you finish your first 2 year fix) to be 4.2%.

The question is therefore whether you believe that you'll be able to get a 3 year fix in 2 years' time for 4.2% or less. If the spread from the base rate on fixed deals remains the same, that would mean that the base rate would need to increase by over 1.6% in the next 2 years. I personally cannot see that happening.

If you want a more thorough answer (which I'll record as part of our new Q&amp;A podcast), send me a PM with the mortgage amount and the details of what overpayments are permitted on the mortgage...",null,0,null,1439883703,null,null,false,0,cu6tz6b,null,t3_3hexqu,null,null,null,t1_cu6tcsv,null,null,null,1441318200,null,9,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,9,null

Us calling him mediocre is more due to our expectations and higher standards we hold of him. The entire team has been mediocre by their standards. He can't be made a scapegoat simply because the team isn't performing as well as they could. Once everyone starts gelling and playing better, then we can judge.

&gt; The silent, the hesitant and the deferential have opinions too, and, as the last election showed, there may be a lot more of them than there are of the vociferous crowds who capture the attention of the media.  
  
If the last election showed anything it's that [34%](http://www.ukpolitical.info/Turnout45.htm) of people didn't have much of an opinion. The media didn't pay them much attention - they concentrated on everyone who voted for someone.

&gt; Moreover, public opinion in a democracy is not a matter of the preparedness to say yes or no to some simplified question posed on a website. It is the result of a process.  
  
A process where you're asked ""Do you want the Alternative Vote? Yes or No?"" after receiving either (a) no information or (b) misinformation.  
  
&gt; It is precisely through such institutions as Parliament that public opinion finds its voice  
  
And it does this by ignoring the website it set up to canvas opinion?  
  
&gt; we do not necessarily know what our own interests are, but depend upon advice and discussion.  
  
Of course: We rely on MPs to tell us, based on their beliefs and the conviction that they're right. /s  
  
&gt; And it is surely right for every parliamentarian to know why Mill thought that the protection of minorities is more important for the proper functioning of democracy than the ability to transcribe vociferous opinions into law.  
  
Or perhaps they could make up their own mind? As perhaps they might have to do when attempting to represent the interests of their constituents by listening to their opinions and deciding upon the best course of action?",null,0,null,1439884346,null,null,false,0,cu6u53b,null,t3_3hcz2i,null,null,null,t3_3hcz2i,null,null,null,1441318278,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Bear in mind that Mourinho set up his team specifically to stop Sterling. He put Ramires on the right to double up on him with Ivanovic. That should tell you how dangerous he is - of all our players, Mourinho changed his team to stop Sterling.

Personally I need to understand the logic/physics that caused what happened. So if the tyres were cracked, id say you have two variables, water &amp; bad tyres.

If it was the first rain after a few days, it brings all the shit out of the gaps in the road such as oil that has dropped from cars, chains, grease from moving parts etc. It all gets trodden in by the tyres and as soon as it rains you have a mini ice rink for a good hour or so. (This tends to happen after sunny spells and you have a short light rain) 

Then the tyres, were they old? Cracking usually means old rubber. My friend used to drive his CBR600 and couldn't keep up without sliding all over in the DRY!. Turns out he had 8 year old tyres on!

Generally, if you check the bike before you ride and are happy, its just going to take time to build up the confidence again. Going out in the rain repeatedly around the same road will help as you'll get back to understanding what the bike can do.

As you become more comfortable face your fears and lock your back wheel up whilst going straight, just give the rear brake a firm but short stab and see that the bike doesn't just fall over. 

EDIT: Also don't be cheap on your tyres. Once you buy good rubber you'll understand.

These are all ""visual"" checks. You don't need to use tools to inspect these parts.

* Check the tyres. The legal requirement for tread is 1mm, but 1.5mm-2mm is the realistic minimum you should be looking for. Any lower than that any you will have to replace the tyre within the first 3-6 months (depending on how you ride it). Protip: Take a 20p coin and place it at various spots *in* the tread. If the ""border"" on the 20p coin is visible any, then the tyre is on its way out. Also check for any tears in the sides of the tyres, any bulges, nails or the like stuck in there. If it falls foul on any of the above then not to worry - this is prime bargaining material for getting the price down, as you will need to replace those tyres sooner rather than later. Tyres for a 125cc should cost ¬£90 for a Michelin front/rear pair, with ¬£30 labour for fitting.
* Check the brake discs. Another visual inspection - look at the brake discs. The bike should have at least one, probably on the front if its a 125cc. Look for scoring or signs that the disc has been damaged. Good brake discs should look [like this](http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/brake-rotors-4.jpg). Bad brake discs would look [like this](http://www.vespalabs.org/_/rsrc/1427271958956/wiki/vespa-maintenance/brakes/replacing-front-disc-brake-rotor-px-125-150-200/%3DDSCI0068.JPG). That scoring you see is where the brake pads have been worn down so much (or had contaminants in them for some time which have not been removed) that the metal on the brake pads have actually worn away at the metal on the disc rotors. Light scoring is fine, but if you can catch your fingernail in the scores around the disc then that will need to be replaced. Again, not a huge loss and bargaining fodder for sure. Similarly, if the brake disc is warped then this will need to be replaced ASAP. Quite easy to spot. A replacement disc may cost ¬£70 OEM on eBay, with ¬£30 labour for fitting.
* Look around the bike for any hints at damage. If the bike has been dropped, then it will be plain as day; these things are quite frankly brittle and made of cheese. Damage doesn't mean it's been abused, but you should be wary that it can point to other things wrong if there is lots of it. Similarly, look for respray areas. Resprays aren't always a red flag - I've touched up plenty of stone chips on my forks myself, as I take pride in how my bike looks. But if a large area has been botched then you will definitely see some evidence of it.
* The chain should be rust-free and well lubricated. Run your finger across the ""inner"" part of the chain. Your finger should be covered in gunk - this is good, and how it should be. It shows the chain is well oiled and lubricated, which is a point many bike owners neglect.
* If the bike has a centre stand ask for it to be raised up and the rear wheel moved forward. You should listen for any knocking sounds that actually vibrate the whole motorcycle. Watch the chain - does it move freely? Does it stick or wobble?
* Ask for the bike to be started, let it idle for 30 seconds, turn it off. Start it again, idle 30 seconds, turn it off. Do this 3-4 times and make sure the bike starts each time. This is to test the battery condition. A healthy, well charged battery should be able to start the bike dozens of times before starting to struggle. An older battery will take 2-3 starts and then start dying, indicating a replacement will need to be ordered. Replacing a battery isn't difficult and is probably a nice first DIY job for you to do. Batteries at available at Halfords for about ¬£30.
* Check all the lights, indicators and their response to the brake lever(s) when the bike is running. Make sure they are bright and look well powered.

Now many working-class voters oppose immigration - but, by and large, they're not racists. The working class is actually a lot more likely than the middle class to work with, live with, mingle with, marry with, migrants. Why do they oppose immigration then? Immigration is proposed as a source of their very real problems - such the lack of quality, dependable, working-class jobs or of social housing. While immigration has been scapegoated for these by the Tories, by Ukip, by the right-wing newspapers, it isn't to blame for it. Welfare rorters make a good scapegoat too - but they are not the source of the problems either. To win the working class back - including the Tories and Ukip voters amongst them - I think Labour needs to start offering a better explanation of what's gone wrong,  and how Labour can fix it.

Can Corbyn convince enough of the working-class Tory/Ukip voters of that to win an election? Perhaps, perhaps not. But perhaps he can start that conversation - and change the party enough that the traditional scapegoating of immigrants or welfare cheats can be nullified in the future.

For example, I was illegally put in a special needs class in Llanberis School because I could not speak welsh at the time, and thus missed out the entirety of my year 4 maths, meaning I was at a disadvantage for years in maths.

Now I don't particularly have a problem with the UK taxpayer subsidising a railway network that provides a net benefit, but let's not fall into the trap of believing that this is ""evil private companies"" profiteering at the expense of the poor rail commuter.

The M4 seemed to have much better suspension (kind of like an M5 in a smaller shell). We only really work with coupes too so they're actually smaller than they seem. In sport mode it's extremely responsive, almost too 'pokey' on the accelerator, you nudge the accelerator and it just zips forward, but it's not like I got a chance to really test it.

He owed a huge debt of gratitude to American servicemen just like your grandfather. I do as well - he almost certainly would not have survived the war if it wasn't for the US military.

The two will never be able to reconcile their differences and will spend the next few years fighting among each other, which will do nothing but make the Tories look organised, efficient and coordinated.

Plus, Corbyn has a lot of beliefs and policies that the public very much do *not* support, such as scrapping Trident, leaving NATO and wanting to discuss the Falklands with Argentina. All the Tories, and the press, have to do is say that he is weak and willing to not only expose us to danger, but stand on the graves of those who died in '82, and his beliefs will back those allegations up. Corbyn wants big public spending. He (for want of a better term) wants to print money to throw at the public. The support the Tories have had for austerity means that Corbyn will be a perfect case study for the Tories' claims that Labour are profligate with spending and can't handle the economy.

And the cherry on the cake, is that his diehard supporters will do nothing constructive to counter these problems. Every time I've mentioned them to his fans, they've either hand-waved them away or genuinely tried to argue ""well, there's an argument to be made for leaving NATO etc"".

Coutinho likes to come into a more central role off the left (mostly so he can bang 30 yard stunners in) and Firmino is still an unknown quantity in that I didn't find myself impressed with him last game. He did decently in the little run out he got against Stoke but that's obviously nowhere near enough time to judge.

I'm probably going to cop a bit of shit for this but I'm not entirely sure if we'll start Lucas solely based on the fact that BR doesn't like to use DMs, even though it's what you would envision to be a tough away game. In addition, a game against Arsenal might not be the best idea to introduce Lucas back into the team (he's not been a regular since his injury - even during preseason - right?). I think it's more likely that we'll see a like for like swap with Hendo for Can if he's unfit and that he'll still start one of either (or both) Lallana and Ibe.

No way in hell do I want Moreno playing LB against Arsenal. Not after the 4-1 last season, I genuinely think Gomez is the better option. If we need to go for it and attack, then sure bring Moreno on but I think starting him is a little audacious against an Arsenal team that surely want to kick on after a so-so start.

Don't think Lovren is being dropped for Sakho either. We've all seen that Rodgers wants Lovren to work out and he's not done badly enough in the past two games to warrant BR changing up the backline (CB isn't exactly a position that you rotate for shits and giggles). I don't want to see him frozen out of the team but I think it's a bit more realistic to expect him to make a season debut (unless, god forbid, it's off the bench) against lesser opposition.

We can't pursue most vehicles anymore, I understand the logic that it's not worth pursuing them because they may be injured or killed but in my mind capturing them following a robbery should trump that.

I'm not talking about no MOT here but robbery with a weapon, hammer attacks etc. These are more common now. 

There was a time when any idiot would get pursued and obviously that is an unnecessary risk. However I do think the current ""life immediately at risk"" idea before allowing any sort of action goes to far in the other direction.

Frankly if you attack someone with a weapon and flee in a vehicle you can get away without being chased. This is ridiculous.

Gomez still in over Moreno, Ramsey having that free-role off the right would pull Moreno all over the place. Like with Mata, vs United at Anfield. Gomez has superior positional sense.

3 man midfield to help keep the ball better and make passing harder for them. Would have made the switch regardless of Henderson's absence, and I think Rodgers is going 4-2-3-1 vs teams we should be beating (8th downwards) and 4-3-3 vs the better sides in the league.

Lallana over Firmino for me still, although he hasn't shown much going forward the pressing and willingness to track back is important, especially down our right/their left with Sanchez. I know Firmino can and will also do this, it's just Lallana is fitter at the moment and can do it for closer to the full 90.

Coutinho on the left. With Gomez unlikely to get caught up the field, there's less need for Coutinho to track back, and having Phillipe stationed higher up the pitch should pin Bellerin back.",null,0,null,1439892970,null,null,1439917595,0,cu6w5xq,null,t3_3hf8fn,null,null,null,t3_3hf8fn,null,null,null,1441319255,null,0,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

Here in the UK, MRIs are incredibly expensive ( several million setup costs), the maintenance is also with the fact the magnets also tend to have a lot of moving parts, liquid nitrogen cooling for superconductivity and all.

These scanners are needed for cancer patients, serious neurological problems and so on. A sore shoulder can be diagnosed with better measures and without adding to an increasing waiting list.

**As an example, an urgent MRI may be needed for a cancer patient who has a metastatic cancer compressing their spine, paralyzing them and preventing any bladder control. A sore shoulder ermm...Yeah.** Probably you could just rest it for a while and not insinuate the UK doctors are shit and always say there is nothing wrong with you. What do you want to say to the people who need it urgently? Nah sorry, sore shoulder coming through?

How the hell did you get to that conclusion? It's an incredibly rare condition and did the fact you had an intense workout not say something to you? If we checked every person who was sore after a workout the NHS A&amp;E would be full of kids after sunday football.

At the end of the day I don't know what more you want from the NHS, but over responding to you when there is clearly nothing wrong with you actually puts the rest of the country out. If the NHS did this for everybody it would go broke overnight.

Nothing wrong with people using the NHS, but you are one of those people who seek to abuse it and never think about people other than yourself. Better safe than sorry obviously, but you take it to a whole new level and then complain about it.

There'll be less happening when you arrive with it being winter, but there should still be quite a few people about. 

I'm not sure about boat licensing - the Cam is a controlled river, but I'd have thought membership of the Cambridge canoe club or one of the University ones would cover that. 

I can't really say how common it is to see kayaks being lugged about - I have several paddlers in my family so I see them on cars several times a week (space at the clubhouse is quite limited so many people keep their boats at home)...

&gt;[Update: In March 2014, Raed Salah was sentenced to eight months in jail for incitement to violence in a speech he made in 2007.

Says it all really.  

[Or let's turn to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raed_Salah)

&gt;According to reports, during a protest speech in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Wadi al-Joz on February 16, 2007, Salah accused Jews of using children's blood to bake bread. Israeli newspapers at the time quoted him as saying:

&gt;&gt;We [Muslims] have never allowed ourselves to knead [the dough for] the bread that breaks the fast in the holy month of Ramadan with children's blood. Whoever wants a more thorough explanation, let him ask what used to happen to some children in Europe, whose blood was mixed in with the dough of the [Jewish] holy bread.[3][8]

&gt;Salaah denied that this was intended literally to repeat a blood libel,[9] and though he was charged with inciting violence and racism, he was never convicted.[3]

Oh, nothing antisemitic about that at all.  I'm sure that it's all been  'debunked'.

These are just blatant attempts to massage the voter lists to get rid of Corbyn voters for any reason they can think of.

null,null,miomike,null,null,null,"Speaking totally as a subscriber and entirely not as a mod, I downvote for a few reasons on this sub. One is when a post (such as the 4th or 5th fantasy football post) doesn't belong on our sub. For Fantasy Football questions go to /r/fantasyfootball, or wait till a free talk friday which will now be weekly.  

Or when a post is either of extremely poor quality, or a slightly different version of an already existing post. This is something that happens a lot with transfer posts, and why I try to keep the transfer thread going. So many rumours do the rounds repeatedly, and through all sorts of different media (paper rumours, sky gossip, twitters, websites, fansites) that if you posted every single one, or even just one every day, there'd be nothing else on the sub.  

I have also noticed that recently some people have been more aggressive and/or personal in their disagreements of opinions. As a mod I find this unacceptable but don't want to be too overbearing, so as a subscriber I downvote.  

Someone saying to me ""Are you fucking blind?"" or something I will downvote, because you could just say ""actually I thought yadayadayda"".  

Ultimately it's about how users wants to vote though. If people disagree with someone they might be more inclined to downvote than discuss. It very rarely used to be the case, but we're growing as a sub and are far larger than a few here might remember, so there's bound to be a larger variety of users who do things differently.  

There will soon be a new content policy posted anyway which will hopefully address some things like this - but us saying ""don't downvote just because you disagree"" amounts to not much - it's up to the individual user.  

Edit: I occasionally downvote unnecessary extreme negativity too - though that, along with reactionary posts like the ""did we screw up this transfer window"" one, I normally just don't upvote as opposed to downvote.

Which is true. But by the same token there are circumstances where it's not dangerous for other road users to do the same thing.

The problem is expecting that because the light is green that it's safe to proceed. All the green light means is that you [don't have to stop](https://www.gov.uk/using-the-road-159-to-203/road-junctions-170-to-183).
And as it says in rule 170 ""Take extra care at junctions"". Sure, mostly it's fine to proceed when the light's green, but I usually have a good look before I continue, especially at roundabouts - there have a been a number of times when I've had near-misses because of people not seeing the lights have turned red. Besides, it's all well and good after a collision protesting that ""your light was on red"" but surely it's better to avoid having a crash in the first place! It also doesn't help that numerous drivers appear ignorant of rule #178: ""Allow cyclists time and space to move off when the green signal shows.""

But 70-80% of the country think that Brussels has to much control and want power rolled back.  Many of those are happy with free movement.  Most others would be happy with free movement if it were rolled back to only include Western European countries with the same standard of living as us.  

Immigration is the biggest individual gripe that Britons have with the EU but it's just a symptom of the disease of Brussels taking power from member states.  In the 21st Century power should be moving closer to people, to councils and devolved bodies not further away to a continent wide government reminiscent of the USSRs central control.  

All over the continent countries have their individual gripes with Brussels.  In France they hate the free market aspects, in Germany they hate paying out so much money, in Spain and Portugal they hate imposed austerity, in Italy they hate Schengen and in Greece they hate the fact that they're no longer an independent country.  But it's all a sympton of the same problem.  Individual states can't control their own affairs.

The road is a dangerous place. In almost all other dangerous places you are expected to prove you are competent and familiar with the dangers you are in and may pose to others before using said place.

If a cyclist swings out in front of traffic, takes a right at a no right turns junction, takes the outside lane of a roundabout all the way around to the third exit, cycle in the middle of a lane on a national speed limit winding country road? He is not just risking his own life. He's causing other traffic to swerve or rapidly halt or otherwise drive unpredictably to avoid the cyclist. It has knock on effects especially during busy periods.

All vehicle users have to go through training and testing suitable to the vehicle they are going to use in order to safely use that vehicle and cause no danger to themselves or others. All vehicles are capable of different things and pose different risks. All have to use the same space. Cycles shouldn't be an exception just because they don't have an engine when they are using the roads like the rest of them.

null,null,Naugrith,null,null,null,"&gt;Registered Supporters. SUPPORTERS. Not people who support other parties.

It is perfectly possible to support two parties. It is possible to have supported another party in the past but choose to switch or add your support to Labour now. A person may even have hated Labour in the past and actively worked against it, but now see a hope that causes them to support Labour for the first time. Why is that so hard to understand? 

Not only this but it is impossible to judge another person‚Äôs motives for voting now, not even if you know how they voted in the past. And Harman doesn‚Äôt even know that. She‚Äôs trying to suppress voters based on guesswork and partial information.

&gt;Harriet Harman wants people who are not supporters of Labour to not pretend to be a supporter of Labour.

No she doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a pretext and its obvious. If she was actually interested in this she would have done it from the start, not just after Corbyn became the frontrunner. It‚Äôs not even subtle.

Harman proposed preventing people from voting who‚Äôd told activists they were voting for another party at some point in the past. What the hell kind of proposal is that? Not only will it prevent many new supporters from joining Labour (which is a good thing for a party that lost so heavily in the election) most of whom are joining now because they are genuinely enthused by the party leadership debates. But it would also cause people to refuse to talk to Labour activists next time, knowing that anything they say will be taken down and used against them. Harman‚Äôs proposal was ill-thought-out and short-sighted. It was just a result of pathetic desperation that things aren‚Äôt going her way, rather than any altruistic reason to improve the democratic process of the election.

&gt;Someone, who is openly and publicly a Tory who is openly and publicly seeking a vote to try and damage the party, managed to receive not one but three ballot papers to vote in this contest.

Unfortunately an open election is open to abuse. That is the price of democracy, and it‚Äôs a price we should be willing to pay for a free democracy. The measures proposed to prevent abuse would turn off some potential real supporters while doing nothing to prevent such people who were genuinely trying to infiltrate the party for nefarious purposes. These people who were serious about it would research the loopholes and easily crack the system. 

Yes, Harman‚Äôs proposal may have caught one or two abusers of the process in the midst of all the damage it would also have caused. But such people are incredibly rare, and most people in a free election won‚Äôt abuse the system. We should not change our core principles of democracy just out of a manipulated fear of a shadowy enemy. However much the powerful people who are threatened by a free election try to convince us that this enemy is hiding under our beds.

You'd end up with people needing to be registered as a cyclist, so that you can store their training status, and you'd presumably need to come up with a distinction between the places you need a license and those you don't, or perhaps just a more thorough test for commuting than riding down a towpath?

null,null,lordweiner27,null,null,null,"Globalisation is completely different from what the EU is about.  The EU is about creating a new state, it's about centralisation.  The clue is in the name ""EUROPEAN Union"" and the fact they won't let countries that aren't deemed 'European' (ie. white Christian) enough join like Turkey.  Let alone countries outside of Europe.  

Globalisation is happening in full force with the EU or without it.  And Britain will always be a full signed up member of that shift.  For example, Britain is one of the most pro free trade countries in the world.  While France's gripe with the EU is that it's too free trade, the frequent gripe in the UK is that it's not free trade enough.  Britain is also a member of every [international organisation](http://i.imgur.com/EtVTnQ6.jpg) going and fully invested in the process of international harmonisation of standards.  And you can bet Britain would have signed it's own TTIP deal with America decades ago if it wasn't in the EU (if this one even goes through at all.)

Globalisation though, should be about countries voluntarily entering into arrangements to bring down barriers where it works for them.  Like I said British people are mostly in favour of bringing down barriers to free movement with other first world countries.  Hence the grass roots campaign for Anglophone free movement.  But the EU is not about voluntary agreements.  It's about compulsion and centralisation.  Where countries want to step back from something they've signed up to, they just can't.  There is no way back.  Greece can't leave the Euro, Britain can't leave free movement with Eastern Europe, Italy can't leave Schengen.  There is only one direction of movement allowed towards move centralisation and harmonisation.  There is no recognition that what's right for Lisbon may not be right for Lyon.

The constituencies are going to be 'equalised' around the registered voters rather than population. Tory areas with high voter registration rates will remain roughly the same, labour areas with low rates will find that four MPs have become three even while population has remained the same. To me there doesn't seem any particular reason to prefer a registered voter model over a population model other than that it will boost the tories.

null,null,Naugrith,null,null,null,"&gt;How would you interpret a sudden surge in membership out of more or less nowhere who's primary aim is to undue the work of members from the last thirty years?

I don‚Äôt see Corbyn‚Äôs policy as trying to undo the work of the last thirty years. That‚Äôs also a strawman. Corbyn has often said he agreed with a lot of what Labour has done, and thought there was a lot of good in Milliband‚Äôs manifesto. 

The media loves to talk in extremes so there‚Äôs lots of language about Corbyn destroying the party and turning back the clock to 1983. But that‚Äôs just so much cheap opinionated claptrap to sell papers. If you listen to what Corbyn himself says he‚Äôs much less radical, much more reasonable. Just as Blair‚Äôs rebranding of the party in 1997 didn‚Äôt come out of the blue, but was built on the work of Kinnock and others before him, so Corbyn‚Äôs policies are built on Milliband and Blair before him. If he chooses to attempt to refocus or rebrand the party in a different direction from before, it is not because he hates the party and wants to destroy its successes, but to build on them and make them better. 

&gt;Leave to one side the substantive arguments as to which values should drive the party or are subjectively ""better"" and assess the practicalities of how it looks and comes across in light of the approach of some of these new members and the general impact of the campaign on existing members and the party as a whole.

I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äòapproach of new members‚Äô you‚Äôre talking about. Could you point to some examples? As far as I know nothings much has been said by any new members, it‚Äôs all just media commentators pushing their fears onto them. 

The impact of the campaign on the Labour party itself has been terrible. But as far as I have seen, this is due entirely to Harman, Blair, Lord Mandleson, etc. The old guard have not missed a trick to insult, belittle, attack, and scaremonger. They are trying to whip the party up against Corbyn even before he‚Äôs elected, and it‚Äôs appalling behaviour. But Corbyn hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong. All he‚Äôs done is stand for election under the rules of his party and present his message to the country. If this message is more popular, inspiring, and powerful than the message of the other candidates, then how is it the appropriate response to blame Corbyn?",null,0,null,1439896629,null,null,false,0,cu6x33z,null,t3_3hfe3x,null,null,null,t1_cu6wo4q,null,null,null,1441319689,null,0,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,0,null

Why on earth would there be so much opposition to taking a test to demonstrate understanding of the rules of the road and intent to follow them?

The opposition is normally based on a fear of the bureaucracy that would be set up to enforce it, probably requiring cyclists to somehow register their bicycles and themselves at some cost, and on the impression that most of the drivers who are most angry about cyclists are themselves among the least-knowledgable road-users of the *current* highway code. When a cyclist gets shouted at to ""read the bloody highway code"" for cycling in the middle of a lane, for example.

&gt; The road is a dangerous place. In almost all other dangerous places you are expected to prove you are competent and familiar with the dangers you are in and may pose to others before using said place.

It's also, though, fairly obvious that passing a test doesn't translate into actually following the rules you were tested on, you don't need to spend very long on the road to notice that. I think policing of dangerous road use would be a better use of the time and money than forcing all these cyclists (many of whom already have some sort of driving license) through another regurgitation of the highway code.

&gt; If a cyclist swings out in front of traffic, takes a right at a no right turns junction, takes the outside lane of a roundabout all the way around to the third exit, 

But motorcyclists can do all this, too, despite having passed a test. And much as the rider will need to be insured, the chances of anyone having remembered his numberplate are pretty miniscule.

&gt; cycle in the middle of a lane on a national speed limit winding country road? 

Isn't this roughly where drivers ought to expect him to be, given the highway code?

I'm a big fan of what they've done with some of the smaller-scale projects they've implemented, but bear in mind they have had some spectacular failures too. The [CAP payments system](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/06/26/rural_payments_digital_exemplar_at_risk_last_year/) springs to mind.

From what I can see from the outside, they are an exemplary design service, with very little capability for systems integration. They've had three high-profile 'wins' I can recall:

* DVLA direct debits and photocard-only licence
* Online passport applications
* Centralised electoral roll registration

The DVLA project sounds so simple I can only assume the DVLA themselves were the greatest block to delivering this basic service years ago. The online passport form just converts your input into a postable form, and the electoral roll registration just emails details to your district council's elections officer, and [it still had loads of problems](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/23/voters_are_missing_its_another_govtdigishambles/).

Bear in mind the costs involved - they employ 700 people, both full-time and contracted. On London wages, I don't really think that that represents good value for money.

In some ways this simple approach has been good. They've delivered a *better* service in these three example cases, where a project to deliver the *right* service would have been doomed from the offset.

However, a lot of their failures seem like hubris - the assumption that with some neat design and Agile practices they can tackle any project, when in fact they lack experience in a lot of domains. For example, their [ID Assurance project](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/category/id-assurance/) sounds particularly sketchy, and I note that their last blog post was in February, by the now departed Bracken.",null,0,null,1439897509,null,null,false,0,cu6xc5q,null,t3_3hbrf6,null,null,null,t3_3hbrf6,null,null,null,1441319807,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Again - this is news to me.  So, in your view are all politicians split 50-50 between antisemites and those covering for pedophiles?  Is the reason why Corbyn should be elected is because he's probably more of an antisemite and therefore not a pedophile?

If you remortgage today, assume fees of ¬£999 for new mortgage, ERC of ¬£3600, and roll all this plus the remaining personal loan into  the mortgage, you'll have a starting balance of ¬£136,599. 

If you pay down the new mortgage at the same rate (¬£1080 per month), then you'll need a mortgage interest rate over those 3 years of 1.39% to get your balance down to the same ¬£112k figure.

This isn't really available to you given that your LTV will still be above 80% with the new mortgage.

That only leaves the consideration of whether you can afford your current position. With take home pay of ¬£2,300pm, the ¬£1,080 payment should be doable. However, with the baby on the way and maternity to come, you really need to be scrimping and saving every penny into an emergency fund to cover than period.

If you work out your budget now and in the future, and determine that you really can't make it by on the current repayment schedule, then you'll have to reconsider taking the loan over 35 years in order to reduce your monthly payments.

However, before doing that, I'd speak to your lender about the possibility of agreed ""payment holidays"" etc.

It's going to be tight, but in my opinion, remortgaging isn't really the solution for you right now...",null,0,null,1439898333,null,null,false,0,cu6xkzc,null,t3_3hfdvk,null,null,null,t3_3hfdvk,null,null,null,1441319923,null,6,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6,null

I started driving in the end. It was (much) cheaper [2] than the train, even taking into account fuel, parking, and depreciation. It took 1h15m[1] instead of 2h20m. The only possible advantage of using the train - not spending 3 hours a day driving - was ruined by the trains invariably being packed standing room only.

And the points about season tickets are very astute as well. I worked at home 2 days a week which made season tickets uneconomical.

All the people moaning about the rest of the country subsidising London - in what world? Travel to London is absurdly overpriced, as are fares on any route / time period in high demand. The thing about mass transit is it's actually cheaper per person, when it's full, but fares do not drop in line with costs because rail travel is a natural monopoly - there's usually only one optimal route and travel time for any given journey, there is no competition.

Fuel @ 10p a mile, 100 mile round trip, ¬£10. Parking between ¬£2.50 and ¬£8 (note that even the rip-off parking that becomes 40% of the journey cost still makes things cheaper than the train). Factor in that I'd own the car anyway because it's useful and you have a lot of room in the remaining ¬£23-ish per day for paying for depreciation. And the hour I'd save per work day was priceless.

Prices for travel to my home town have gone up something like 260% (from ¬£40 to ¬£107 return, off peak) in the 20 years since I was at university ; inflation since 1995 has been 77.5%

Prices rising at 3.3x the rate of inflation (conservatively) is not indicative of the power of competition in the market. It's indicative of a cash-cow being milked.

&gt; It is also worth noting that every Labour leader who has won an election has been from the right of the party (or at very most the centre)



There is an obvious exception to this rule (and seeing as only three labour leaders have won an election that is significant) with Harold Wilson. Wilson was a Bevanite in the party's left who managed to defeat the right wing Hugh Gaitskell in the 1960 leadership and then won four separate elections. You say the same happens to the Tories but that would ignore the very obvious example of Margaret Thatcher. Callaghan was the centrist candidate in the 1979 election [to the extent that people called him a fucking Tory](http://www.markpack.org.uk/files/2015/08/Keith-Waite-cartoon-from-1979-general-election1-e1438512845667.jpg) and yet he lost. 



I think an ignored element of this post and the one that I believe will shift the election most is spin. Wilson could win because he knew how to negotiate public opinion; the same is true with Blair, Thatcher and Cameron. And it is where Callaghan, Hague, Miliband and more than anyone, Michael Foot, failed tremendously at. Public image is more important than policy in my opinion, just look at UKIP supporters who say there most likely to return to Labour if Corbyn is leader.

Open standard investing account. Deposit ¬£10k. Buy Vanguard fund ¬£10k. 1 year later, fund is worth ¬£12k, and pays ¬£200 dividend.

I pay tax on the ¬£200 as if it were another ¬£200 on my normal earnings.

IF I decide to cash out, I don't pay any tax on the ¬£2000 capital gain as it is below the ¬£11100 threshold. (The CGT allowance is completely separate? Seems like a good deal).
IF I decide to leave money where it is, nothing happens tax wise until fund is closed.

I am really surprised at how much difference it makes, even if I were to massively overpay on my new mortgage (which I wouldn't).

As for an emergency fund, we do have a little (under $1000) stashed away in premium bonds for emergencies, but having lower outgoings would be preferable in the short term.

I would rather not extent my mortgage period, the original length was 25 years and I am coming up to 30 now, meaning our original mortgage will be paid off when I am 53, If I ever need to extent my mortgage period I would rather keep that option as a backup later down the line, and Debt Free at 53 has a nice ring to it :).

I may look into taking a payment holiday, during which time we could try to wipe out the personal loan, the reason we had never thought of doing that is because we would accrue more interest on the mortgage in that time than we would save by paying off the personal loan early. But it's definitely something to look into if it gets really tight.

The only exception to that is the case when the customer has received a reduced-price version of the same product/service due to promising to use the product/service for a longer time. You can still cancel, but you must retroactively recalculate prices without said benefits.

You're in the slightly unusual position that your loan is cheaper than your mortgage.  So there's no point in consolidating unless it is **all** at a cheaper rate.

I'm assuming that it isn't possible to extend your loan (at the same rate) in order to overpay on the mortgage?

Have you looked to see if there is an ERC on the loan?  It might influence the final maths.

Just looking at the mortgage.  The difference between the new 3% rate and the old 4.99% rate is 1.99%.  Which, on a loan of ¬£120,000 is saving ¬£2,388 per year in interest repayments.

With an ERC of ¬£3,600 - it'll take you 1.5 years to ""break-even"".  That's assuming no extra fees - which could dramatically change the picture.

Adding the loan to that will save you around ¬£144 per year.  Again, assuming no extra fees.

Realistically, you're probably looking at only really saving money after the 2nd year.  Although, as you point out, money is tight *now* and it would reduce your monthly outgoings at the expense of a longer term debt.

* You can reduce your overpayments - that'll save ¬£360 a year.  
* Look at https://www.zopa.com/ for a personal loan. It looks like you could shift that ¬£12k to 3.6% - perhaps overborrow and use it to pay of some of the mortgage.
* What lifestyle changes can you make? Even simple things like changing your gas supplier can help.
* Think about what long term investments you want to make for your child.  Have a read of [Make Your Child A Millionaire](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0752271733/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0752271733&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=shkspr-21).
* You need to have a conversation with your wife about whether she plans to return to work.  You also need to start budgeting now for all the things you want to buy for the baby.  Take a look at nearly new sales and Freecycle for good quality kit.

My entirely unqualified suggestion is that you accept a higher debt, fixed for as long as you can, simply because it will lower your monthly outgoings at time when you need them most.  You should work aggressively to stick to a budget so that when you're out of these woods you can go back to overpaying the debt.

If you stigmatise cycling without a helmet, or even pass laws that make it illegal to cycle without a helmet, you will put people off cycling full stop - and it is now established that it is much worse for your health and risk of disability or dying early to *not cycle* than it is to cycle without a helmet.

You're otherwise right, though, in that he was actually from the left of the party. I was basing that claim on something Neil Kinnock once said. That'll learn me for listening to him.

I think it's fair to say, however, that wherever he started, Wilson saw the merit in pursuing quite centrist policies, including not really nationalising anything, and was attacked more from the left than he was from the right within his own party (e.g., by Ken Livingstone), which was also what led me to characterise him as right/centrist. 

I didn't, however, say, that *all* right-wing Labour leaders won, just that all left-wing ones lost! Also, my argument was that there was a general historical tendency for left parties to lose by being too leftist, and right parties to lose by being too rightist, not that this explained every election result, ever. In the case of '79, while Thatcher was clearly very right-wing, her policies were sufficiently new (and in some cases populist) that they didn't fit neatly into the left/right paradigm of the time at all. Additionally, it's still possible to argue that if Labour had leant a little more right, they'd have held onto some of the voters who switched to Thatcher. Finally, she was notably attacked by many... conservative Conservatives (you know what I mean), which added to the image of her as breaking with the old ways, which were clearly falling apart.",null,0,null,1439901062,null,null,false,0,cu6yiph,null,t3_3hbmvb,null,null,null,t1_cu6xv74,null,null,null,1441320365,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

I guess I was just confused.  Obviously, learning definitions by context is how we learn definitions of words most of the time, since it's not like we as children used the dictionary for every single word we heard for the first time (and we still don't do it as adults unless the context is unclear).

Here, the context is ambiguous at best.

If you're a techie then you'll meet a lot of like minded local people at some of the meetups in the city. You'll meet loads of other students anyway, but there are some great local groups for different programming languages, hacking, hardware hacking/moding, digital fabrications, drones, etc. Many of these, along with lots of other exciting techie things and software projects happen at [DoES Liverpool](http://doesliverpool.com/).

There is a google calendar of [Liverpool Digital Events](http://defnetmedia.com/tech-news/item/1656-liverpool-digital-events-calendar.html) happening in the city with descriptions and locations.

If you're interested in talks, debates and meeting the interesting people who go to them then there is [Thinking Liverpool](http://www.thinkingliverpool.com/) which is a site listing and weekly mailing list of thinking events in the city.

I really, really recommend [Ignite](http://igniteliverpool.com/), which is a quarterly evening of 5 min talks. It's well attended and the talks are fascinatingly diverse. The next date isn't announced yet but it'll probably be in October so keep an eye out.

I don't tend to go to as many of these things as I used to as particular hobbies have kind of taken over. My own little plug here is that as a young and (presumably) single guy who is going to be spending most of your uni life surrounded by socially awkward guys, it'd be a massively positive thing for you to take dance classes. They are female dominated so men are always in demand, you learn a really valuable skill, it's great for building physical skills(a couple of national teachers started dancing to help with their semi-pro football training and gave up the football for dancing), and you get to meet a really diverse range of people outside of the student community. Plus, when you go out clubbing with mates you'll be so much more confident and outgoing and have more fun throughout uni. I do Lindy hop with [MerseySwing](http://www.merseyswing.com/) which I really recommend(Young crowd, really enthusiastic and we travel around the UK a fair bit), but there are a bunch of different types which you'd get loads out of.

null,null,SufferSome,null,null,null,"&gt; SNP's manifesto is staunchly anti-austerity, which IMO is a massive difference from Labour, as it has an effect on the running of every aspect of the country.

It simply wasn't. From the IFS analysis of the spending plans published in the party manifestos:

""The SNP‚Äôs fiscal numbers imply the same reduction in borrowing over the next parliament as for Labour... The SNP‚Äôs stated plans do not necessarily match their anti-austerity rhetoric.""

&gt;SNP aren't popular because of the referendum, the SNP and referendum were popular because of the same disconnect between Scotland and the rest of the UK.

I beg to differ. As above, the policy differences are very small between the SNP and Labour. What happened during the referendum was that Scottish Labour consistently ridiculed and hectored a large portion of its own membership.

Given two parties offering the same policies, one of which has called you an idiot for your strongly-held political beliefs, who would you vote for?

null,null,Naugrith,null,null,null,"&gt;I'm saying a system that sent not one but three ballots to someone who has publicly declared that they are a Tory trying to undermine Labour has some serious problems and that we need to take serious steps to remedy them.

I agree with you. They shouldn‚Äôt have sent that guy one ballot, let alone three. We are in full agreement on this issue. But where we disagree is on the level of risk this one incident represents. I would argue this is an isolated case, and these three votes (and perhaps the handful of others who are doing similar) will be negligible among the votes of more than 100,000 who genuinely want the best for the future of Labour. On the other hand I expect you would argue it‚Äôs the tip of the iceberg and represents a powerful voting bloc that will swing the election. The truth is, neither of us know, or can know. You‚Äôre speaking from fear of the worst, while I‚Äôm speaking from hope of the best, but neither of us has any facts to back up our case. 

And secondly we disagree that Harman‚Äôs proposal, or any proposal, would stand a chance of preventing any serious effort at entryism. If someone wanted to prove a point, like this twitter troll, then any system can be hacked. The point of the system is to deter enough people with bad motives, while encouraging the maximum amount of people with good motives. This is always going to be a balancing act. If you are too strict then you prevent new supporters and the party withers, but if you are too open you risk anti-Labour voters trying to influence the election. 

Although I would argue that this threat is not really a threat at all since supporters can‚Äôt do *anything* except vote for one of four candidates already nominated by the party itself. That‚Äôs hardly like the voters have the option to vote for Labour‚Äôs seppuku. Although if you read the more vitriolic commentators (most of whom *actually* don‚Äôt have Labour‚Äôs best interests at heart by the way) you‚Äôd think this was the option on the ballot.

But what is certain is that there‚Äôs nothing we can do about it now. Any flaws in the system should have been fixed long before the nominations, not now the supporters have paid their money and the ballots are going out. Any attempt to adjust the rules now, even if entirely well-meaning (and I suspect there is little of this) will merely look like self-serving vote fraud by the bosses, and attempts to dictatorially install a pre-chosen candidate over the will of the people. That‚Äôs hardly going to play well with anyone. And the Tories will have a field day with it. Labour won‚Äôt recover its credibility for decades.

This is the biggest issue, that all this scaremongering rhetoric doesn‚Äôt actually fix the problem of potential entryism, however big the problem may or may not be. All it does is damage the party. It attempts to pre-emptively invalidate the election, laying the groundwork for Corbyn to be stabbed in the back as soon as he wins. And if this succeeds, if these grandees‚Äô plans work, *this* will be the death knell for Labour. It barely survived the civil wars of the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs. The electorate has no patience for it nowadays. 

I don‚Äôt know what the Labour leadership are thinking they are doing. Why they think invalidating their own leadership campaign will play well with the electorate in 2020 is beyond me. Or why they think claiming the person who is likely going to be their leader is ‚Äòunelectable‚Äô is a smart move. Even if they genuinely agree with this argument, it's hardly smart to argue it since then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. These people who call their probable future leader 'unelectable' are just doing the Tory's work for them. They‚Äôre cutting off their own feet because they‚Äôre scared they may walk in the wrong direction.

Give over.

null,null,powatom,null,null,null,"&gt; No, it is not 'definitely a stupid choice'. If helmets were enormously important for safety then we would see that reflected in the literature, however of the many studies conducted only small effects have been seen, and they are often outweighed by other effects - such as motorists acting more dangerously around what they (falsely) see as a less vulnerable cyclist, or a decrease in head injuries only coming at a similar increase in neck injuries.

You can throw out any statistics you like, but the simple **fact** remains that if you bang your head, a monumentally important part of your body, onto some surface at speed, then your risk of serious injury is higher than if you happened to be wearing a helmet. This is basic physics and biology. Your body is soft, the ground is hard.

Whether drivers are more dangerous around helmet wearing cyclists is (almost) irrelevant. Regardless of the cause of an accident, you are more likely to be seriously injured if you are not wearing protective gear.

&gt; If you stigmatise cycling without a helmet, or even pass laws that make it illegal to cycle without a helmet, you will put people off cycling full stop - and it is now established that it is much worse for your health and risk of disability or dying early to not cycle than it is to cycle without a helmet

Healthier options being healthier for you is not controversial. Everybody knows cycling is better for your health than driving, but we're not talking about general health statistics, we're talking about falling off a bicycle or being hit by another vehicle. This will happen regardless of the number or quality of road users, and to simply refuse to accept that protective gear makes such an accident less dangerous is ludicrous.

&gt; So if we're going to characterise anyone as stupid, then first it ought to be the vast majority of motorists that do not incorporate vigorous exercise into their daily lives, and secondly those that think a helmet must be important because everyone knows it is without actually doing a shred of research.

You're conflating the risks of general lifestyle with the risks of road-usage. They are not equal. If you fall under the wheels of a lorry, you are likely to be killed or seriously injured no matter how healthy you may be otherwise. Wearing protective gear helps to reduce the damage that random accidents can do to your body, whether you're a healthy person or not.

Not taking care of your general health is stupid, yes. That doesn't mean that those who don't take care of their general health are stupider than people who share the road with rapidly moving metal cages that are powered by explosions, and refuse to wear protective gear whilst skipping red lights.

&gt; Without a clear indicator of increased risk I am going to keep cycling without a helmet. If I felt I had to wear one, I would probably stop cycling, such is the inconvenience.

The inconvenience of wearing a helmet? It's your call - but don't complain when you smack your head into the ground and you suddenly realise that a helmet would have been a smart move.",null,0,null,1439902188,null,null,false,0,cu6yyu6,null,t3_3hffzo,null,null,null,t1_cu6yi0l,null,null,null,1441320576,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

PC games are actually ridiculously huge - one of the few media that has kept pace, or even out-stripped the increase in internet connection bandwidth. Updates can be of the order of hundreds of MB, and games themselves can be upwards of 50GB. PC games are pretty much never sold on physical media thesedays, so if you get a lot of games on steam or w/e, you do notice the benefit of the bandwidth. Steam are also one of the providers who will send you data as fast as you can take it.

This is an good point, but it's interesting to note, than even with a 74mbps connection, I sometimes get hitching streaming from iPlayer or Youtube, and even when the resolution and bitrate are clearly not maxing out my connection. We're starting to see situations where latency, and the ability to serve up the content as advertised is a key factor for orgs like youtube, netflix etc. Sometimes I can get 1440p from youtube, at a decent bitrate, with no hitching; and other times, 720p at potato bitrate seems to be a problem, doubly for iPlayer and twitch.

The food brings people in but the money isn't there, not the big bucks anyway.

It's the same here.

I would agree that the NHS sometimes is not as obsessive as it could be but often, as you saw in your case, this is because it is harmful to do more and more tests. The rates of false positives go through the roof and NNT , number needed to treat vs the number needed to harm starts to become an issue. 

Prevention is there, it is just people dont like being told that 50% of our health problems could be solved if we didn't get fat, drink too much or smoke. Diagnosis again, the focus of the NHS is the approach that use your clinical skills, your doctor is meant to know things. Please try to use that knowledge first instead of the idiots approach to just randomly test for everything. 

From experience the tests do not help if you do not know what you are looking for. As for treatment being faster I guess that is the price you pay for an NHS and not private, I'm happy to concede that but thats what we want as a country and I certainly understand both sides. 

**It appears you think just because a test isn't being done you think doctors aren't necessarily trying to diagnose you. They are, they just do it without expensive tests** because the NHS lives in the real world unlike insurance company healthcare which is about the opposite - how can we get the diagnosis while getting as much expense as possible.

If there are, I haven't met any.  

I think you really, really underestimate how HUGE the United States is.  There are 300+ million people and there's no problem with population density; in fact, there are entire states where there's no civilization for hundreds of miles.

I went to a pretty large private university (University of Southern California) with a large international population, and I lived in Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego, all 3 pretty big cities -- and never really met any British people (maybe heard one or two in class).

Unless they're all in New York or something, I can't imagine where they all are. I am 99% sure that they're dispersed among the U.S. -- that's another thing that a lot of British people don't understand... the U.S. is HUGE.  I've heard of British people thinking they can easily visit, say, New York and Los Angeles in one trip; that would take at least 2 weeks to do.  To put it in perspective, it's about a 5.5 hour flight from coast to coast.  I've heard of people visiting California planning on visiting San Francisco and LA all in a one-week visit, which is ridiculous by car; it's 8-10 hours driving, meaning you lose a day simply by driving,  or about 20% of your trip, assuming you fly out on a Friday (and get in late Saturday) and fly black on a Friday morning.

There is definitely no ""British town"" or a community of British people in *any* city, major or otherwise.

The pedestrian is not usually walking on the road or skipping red lights. The pedestrian also has a separate space to walk, which means they are very infrequently actually *on the road*.

You can keep up this false equivalence all you like, but I suspect the vast, vast majority of people are going to reject your logic. Riding a fast moving bike on the road that is shared by vehicles *is inherently more dangerous for your own personal health than walking on the pavement*. A pedestrian is not travelling at speed. They are not in contact with any metallic means of transportation. They're not sharing the actual road. They don't (usually) have to worry about a vehicle actually striking them. Pavements are often (although not always) protected by fences and parked vehicles. Pedestrians often have a place that they can step aside or at least run away from incoming danger. Pedestrians don't need helmets because walking is not all that dangerous unless you actually trip or a car mounts the kerb and hits you.

Being on the road itself is more dangerous than not being on the road. Wearing protective gear is less dangerous than not wearing protective gear. Arguing that a lot of helmets may not be as good as people think is not an argument to not wear a helmet. It's an argument to wear a better helmet.


Original post below:

Here is all the research you need:

1. Put a helmet on. Now smack your head into a wall.

2. Take helmet off. Now smack your head into a wall.

Which one does more damage?

The reason pedestrians don't wear helmets is because walking about is not all that risky. Yes, you can trip and yes, cars can mount the pavement. Planes can also fall from the sky. Gas pipes can explode. Buildings can collapse and the ground can open up. The chances of any single one of those things *actually happening* are relatively slim.

Travelling at speed in a dangerous environment increases the risk of something bad happening to you. Not wearing protective gear increases the risk of you being hurt when that does happen.

I'm not really sure what else can be said here. There are very good reasons that pedestrians do not walk on the road with dangerous vehicles - and that reason is because dangerous vehicles are dangerous. If you want to ride a bike without a helmet then more power to you, but I know that if I came off that bike in the middle of a busy junction at high speed, I'd want to be wearing one.",null,0,null,1439903756,null,null,1439904653,0,cu6znf7,null,t3_3hffzo,null,null,null,t1_cu6zeev,null,null,null,1441320897,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,null,zandrew,null,null,null,"Hi mate

Let me try to answer these questions using my experience. Shoreditch-Westfery route will be quite easy as it mostly follows the Cycle Superhighway 3 (CS3). You'll join it on cable street, then follow Limehouse Causeway (if I'm not mistaken about the name) which will bring you to Westferry. Try to keep to that route - there's lots of people on bikes using it and there is safety in numbers as drivers expect you to be there. 

It's also a short distance. I do around 8 to 10 miles every day from east london into central london as well as shoreditch occasionally. It's nice and easy - don't worry about a horrible death, there's little chance it happens - just stay well away from the left side of lorries. 

I don't change clothes when coming to the office. I don't get massively sweaty because I don't ride like I'm competing in TdF. I've got a town bike (think granny bike) which I can recommend as it give you a comfortable riding position. Having said that I've seen plenty of suited up people riding bromptons. 

When it comes to rain - I just grin and bear it. What helps is a good quality rain poncho/overshoes. You can't avoid it. You'll soon learn to forget about the rain. On a sidenote I maybe got wet about 10 times last year. 

I don't know if you have a bike yet but consider spending money on a good bike. Make sure it's got all you need - lights, mudguards, good brakes, comofrtable saddle, puncture proof tyres (armadillos or marathon plus), bell and don't spend on things you won't need like carbon fibre frame, 500 gears and skinny tyres. Also invest in a lock and buy insurance - it costs 10% of your bikes price a year and gives you priceless peace of mind.

Yes, because current fares are totally fair and justified! /s

&gt;Which requires billions spent on new railways. Again, someone has to pay for this and since rail passengers are a minority of the travelling public, the weight will not fall equally on their shoulders.

Perhaps if a significant chunk of the money was actually spent on improving the lines instead of being pocketed as profit, or wasted frivolous crap nobody cares about, we wouldn't be needing billions of investment.

&gt;So nearly empty train carriages run at unusual hours? This is not an economical way to run a service. Railways are expensive to run.

That is not what I'm referring to. Say service 1 has gone down due to a fault. Currently, those passengers would be dropped off at the nearest station, until the next regularly scheduled train shows up. An intelligent system that puts the passengers first would have the next available train stop at that station, regardless of whether it's supposed to stop there or not, and pick those passengers up.",null,0,null,1439903850,null,null,false,0,cu6zozg,null,t3_3hf6zt,null,null,null,t1_cu6z7wk,null,null,null,1441320918,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Don't reply then.

If Agger isn't lying, then Rodgers can clearly be a pretty shit man-manager.

&gt;He said he didn't like that Rodgers wasn't 'straight' with him about him having to be sold, but the fact is selling him was in the club's best interest at the time.

He said more than that mate. The Danish interview earlier this year does not paint Rodgers in a nice light.

Having to sell someone is no excuse for being a tosser and lying to someone.

&gt;You can use Agger as some sort of proof of this, and everyone else will just point to the many players at Liverpool (including newer ones like Milner) who have nothing but good things to say about Rodgers (including Henderson, Coutinho, Sturridge, Gerrard et al - our best players). It's proof of nothing.

So what you're saying is that because the players that have been treated well by Rodgers praise him, that means that the players that have criticised him are unworthy of comment?

Can it not be a bit of both? I don't understand why this is hard to grasp. Clearly Rodgers has his favourites, and once he doesn't rate you any more, he becomes a bit of a cunt.

The clearest way to put what I'm trying to say, rather than getting hung up on one or two words/sentences of it, is that Corbyn spots all the problems, sure -- that's the easy part.

But he doesn't even scratch the surface with regards to sensible solutions to them. He just shouts about them and builds resentment on all sides with regards the issues and other people involved. 

This isn't pure hyperbole, you can easily find plenty of expert opinion on the matter. [Here's](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/corbyn-and-the-political-economy-of-nostalgia/#Author) a straightforward example. 

Also just take note of what people are actually saying about him; it isn't all down to media manipulation/brainwashing -- people, journalists, etc genuinely see it this way. But maybe we're all dishonest or deluded and set on straw manning Corbyn because there really aren't any issues with what he advocates?

A brief note on corporate tax: I don't know how much you know about this area of the law, but one thing you learn at law school is that ""closing loopholes"" is a joke of a solution. The way it works is that a business will just restructure itself and hire advisory services. Meanwhile you are piling more on less mobile businesses to have to keep up with and comply with. 

It isn't worth the political time to devise and argue over such a trite solution (but hey, that's what politicians are for). Tax regulation is intensely long and complicated (I remember the tax module required 5 thick books of statutes) and tax lawyers exist to find out how to best navigate it.  

What's really needed is a sort of international body to coordinate regulating and auditing companies. Until then, the UK acting on its own to ""close loopholes"" and raise tax is about as helpful as shooting yourself in the foot. There are also sensible arguments that say *lower* corporation tax, a streamlined framework and consolidating the tax codes would actually be more effective.

Everyone can have a bad game here and there, but it just bothered me that by far and away the most experienced player on either side in terms of Premier League appearances was so poor.

I get the feeling Koeman is far from convinced by his quality, and perhaps a loan would benefit his development, but I think Clasie will be out for some time and shouldn't imagine Saints will be happy plodding along with just four midfielders for the weeks (or months - he was wearing a cast/boot this weekend) until he's available again.

**Clyne-** He's been Liverpool's best player over the first two matches. Can't say enough about how well he's done at both ends of the pitch and I've yet to see him get caught out of position. If he keeps his level of play up everyone will be talking about how much of a bargain he was.

**Benteke-** Striker is the hardest position to adjust between teams IMO but Benteke looks to be fitting in well and he and Coutinho looked like their chemistry together was quickly developing in the last match. He cost a lot of money sure but he was Liverpool's best option. His touch and control have been really good so far. I'm sure you all are quite happy with him so far and you should be.

**Gomez-** Gomez had a fantastic debut and a decent performance against Bournemouth. He's got the athleticism to play at CB or LB/RB which is great for a team. To look as comfortable as he has so far on a new team in the Prem should have you guys excited. This isn't a criticism on him at all, but I think having a right-footed left back in today's game is quite detrimental to your attack and width, especially when Coutinho, Firmino, and Ibe are all right-footed and will be cutting in playing on the left wing. For the overall balance of the team I'd be hoping Moreno can string together some good performances and that Gomez's future is at CB. I can definitely see Gomez being used at LB in games against the top 4 though.

**Milner-** Milner has been good, but I haven't seen any moments of greatness from him either. Some of that is probably because he's only had the freedom to go forward for the 25 minutes Can played in the first match. The one area I feel he's been very good at is the precision on his passes. He's been super accurate passing the ball around and I can't remember any lazy passes or horrible decisions from him. Hendo has looked the better of the two, but we're two matches in and he still has some settling in to do. I would again be happy with his transfer as a Liverpool fan.

**Firmino-** He's barely played so I can't say much. He looked dangerous on the ball in last week's match and looked uninterested and sloppy against Bournemouth. Knowing how he played for Hoffenheim and seeing Lallana and Ibe's uninspiring performances from the first two matches I'd want him in the starting lineup over either one of them. 

Out of all your new signings, Ings and Origi are the only ones who haven't contributed so far and aside from Firmino who hasn't played enough everybody has looked quite good. I know everyone isn't guaranteed good form from here on out, but you guys have every reason to be ecstatic about the players you've brought in so far.

My loan's ERC is not listed on the Nationwide website, it just says ""call us and we'll give you a settlement quote"" I can't find any hard figures, but I have found some anecdotal evidence on some money forums that in the past Nationwide have charged 2 months interest which in my case would be under ¬£100.

I think I will look into reducing my overpayments on the mortgage, that's a good idea, every little helps!

I will have a look at Zopa, Nationwide is actually offering a 3.6% loan at the moment, however I tried applying for it/moving my current loan to the lower rate, and I wasn't offered that rate, my credit report on Noddle looks fine currently, but I am concerned that if my own bank won't lend at that rate to me, why would a different company? (Edit: I just had a look at Zopa and they don't seem to be offering anything better than 4.8% at the moment)

We'll take a look at lifestyle changes but I do not think we can save much on utilities since we're on Utility Warehouse which is already one of the cheapest suppliers.

I will have a look at that book, it looks good.

Also my wife has said that she is planning on going back to work, but only part time, (and not the same job she has currently). As for getting stuff for the baby, we have already got some bargains at nearly new sales/freecycle so we're already doing that advice.

We were outplayed for the most part against Stoke, and only started looking like the better team about 70 minutes in and it is fortunate one of our players managed some individual brilliance to win it for us. Tactically and performance wise, we certainly were lucky to win that game.

Now we have Bournemouth at home, and you can argue they were always going to turn up because it's a big occasion for them, but to be dominated for large parts of the game at home to them is just embarrassing. Their disallowed goal, while cases can be made as to why it was ruled out, the majority of the time referee's would allow it. We were lucky again. Our goal under the new rules should not have stood, again we were extremely lucky. 

We have the points in the bag, yes, but if we play like the shit we churned out yesterday against Arsenal, I fear for how many we will concede. 

If Bournemouth can look more threatening, and exploit our inability to cope with any teams that press us, Arsenal will run wild. They themselves haven't looked their best, but against Palace they created a shit load of chances, and just didn't score them. Sanchez is looking ready to play too. 

In my opinion, the negativity is justified. We're playing like we were last season, just with better players papering over the cracks of our tactics so far. We create very little chances, our defense despite having the 2 clean sheets has been unconvincing bar Clyne. 

Our best defender is being alienated and might be sold, and we're also looking like we're losing a long term player who the fans love and does do a job for us.

It's largely about control of the situation.

In slow moving traffic, as a cyclist, you are at liberty to direct the amount of danger you put yourself in, and gauge the perceived threat at a pace that suits you.

When I manoeuvre through traffic, I do so by staying in the eye-line of the driver, either directly behind or visible in their right mirror, before overtaking quickly.

Getting passed from behind at 40mph with 1ft of room is not the same as passing a near stationary car with 1ft of room!

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; She has land because her family killed the people than owned it &amp; took it, that's what actually happened, that's not an opinion.

Not in any meaningful sense.

George I was the first Hanover, ascending peacefully to the British throne in 1714 as the nearest Protestant relative of Anne (and he really wasn't that close. They shared a Great-Grandparent, which tells you how hard they were scraping the barrel to find an heir).

No monarch has taken the throne by force since then. Victoria was a Hanover, and Albert brought in the Saxe-Coburg Gotha line by marriage, which was later renamed to Windsor, and Philip brought in the easy-to-remember Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg line, but unsurprisingly they retained the Windsor name.

Yes, if we want to go 500+ years back, monarchs did acquire lands by force. Mostly the English capturing bits of Scotland and then the Scots capturing it back, with the odd European excursion to keep things interesting. But the current line basically just lucked out into inheriting the throne, and for the most part it's rich families making strategic marriages and partnerships.

Indeed, no *British* monarch has taken their throne by force. The fighting tended to go on between the Monarchs of England and Scotland, but even for the 100 years before Anne came to the throne, it was generally a case of parliament deposing a Catholic Monarch in favour of a Protestant or some such like - infighting within the same family rather than a monarch leading an army to capture a country and laying claim to it's lands and people.",null,0,null,1439905195,null,null,false,0,cu70cd0,null,t3_3hfru4,null,null,null,t1_cu6zeks,null,null,null,1441604441,null,6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

What I am getting at is that Dan Hannan  seems to think we abandoned them and this is us making up for it when actually countries are changing there relationship all the time.

I met Olivier Letang (assistant team manager of the Paris club) a few times. We first considered the possible role of Kevin before talking numbers.

I fail to see how his status in the League back then was much greater than Stones' is now. You seem to think that Stones is some complete chump and David Luiz was world class, I'd argue most Chelsea fans would take Stones over having David Luiz back every day of the week

no offence but you must be an idiot. please stop putting words into my mouth and look at the god damn reply im responding to. at the time Luiz was a better player than Stones is now. We're talking about a 21 year old who hasnt played one full season yet he is meant to go for the same price as David Luiz as thats reasonable according to the person i replied to. All those things, his experience his versatility the fact that he partnered with Thiago Silva for Brazil contributed to his price. he had boat loads of experience at the top level and if i have to explain that to someone then Im done. 

&gt; I'd argue most Chelsea fans would take Stones over having David Luiz back every day of the week.

theres not much I can say without insulting but can you read or do you just put words in peoples mouths? 

My last point makes perfect sense how are you saying ""I never implied that the Germany game influenced people's opinions"" when you replied to me with a video of the world cup game. are you that dim? It was after we sold Luiz so its irrelevant and he was not as badly rated before the world cup game compared to after. I made a comment saying to someone that David Luiz was a solid player and his price tag can be explained for a number of things that Stones doesn't have then you post a video of the world cup which was after we sold him, after they made a bid for him. 

Ake is a youth player, who is a 3rd choice loanee at a promoted Watford. never played in the champions league, never played for his NT team, never had experience at the top level yet youre bringing him up as a comparison to David Luiz. Im talking to an idiot sorry


Also I'll say it again because you dont even know what you're talking about. You say that you dont think Stones is worth over 30M yet you're telling me at the same time that I'm wrong to call him over rated when Im fucking telling someone there is no sense and it is in no way reasonable for him to go anywhere near the same prize as Luiz as he seems to think by saying 

&gt;I understand why Stones is going for as high as he is. 

He was fine against us. Luiz is comfortable on the ball he can move forward and hold possession. He is strong and can shrug off players. Hes good at set pieces like I said and he has a confidence on the ball that this 21 year old at Everton is being entirely over rated for. He is a good defender, one Brazil match which is no way all his fault at all like youre stupidly trying to pretend doesnt make him a shit defender. He didnt struggle against us in the champions league last year. I bet you dont watch Stones and its clear because you dont even know what you're saying by contradicting yourself that you have no clue on Luiz.

Stoke away is a tough place to go. Not many teams will come away from the Britannia with a point, never mind all three. We kept it tight at the back and limited a good Stoke team to a handful of half chances and long shots. Coutinho sealed it with a wonder strike, which was the extra bit of class that we had which they didn't.

Bournemouth played extremely well yesterday and they caused us problems that need to be addressed. Their goal should have stood and ours shouldn't, we got the breaks with the big decisions. Still, overall, we deserved to win the game. They didn't have any meaningful shot on target and only had 3 decent attempts at goal. On the other hand we hit the bar twice and had at least one other clear cut chance: Coutinho at the end of the first half. 

You say we're playing like we were last season but we're not. Our defensive cohesion is miles better. Our last two games last season, Stoke scored 6 against us and Crystal Palace put 3 past us at Anfield.

We look much more solid with Clyne and Gomez in the full back positions and with Henderson/Milner/Can in midfield. Attacking wise, we will improve. Benteke already looks good. Firmino will add a lot of creativity and Sturridge is still to come back.

Basically, she has no rights by default; to obtain *any* rights, she must first apply to the Family Court via [form C2](http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=78) for permission to apply to the court; if permission is granted, [form C100](http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2253) lets her apply for a court order that would (if granted) give her some access rights to her grandchild. If she goes down this route, you should be given the opportunity to oppose her application at every step along the route.

However, the [Children Act 1989](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/contents) is very clear that your request has to be in the best interests of the child; given that your partner's mother didn't raise her own children and has never had any contact with your children, that you and your partner are both decent parents yourselves, and that you're allowing all your other relatives reasonable access to the child, it's unlikely that the court would respond to her form C2 with anything other than a refusal of permission - there's simply no reason to believe that your child is going to suffer if they never meet one of their relatives.",null,0,null,1439906442,null,null,false,0,cu70ygu,null,t3_3hfqwh,null,null,null,t3_3hfqwh,null,null,null,1441321513,null,3,null,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,3,null

Apologies, I just saw the 'h' in your username!

&gt; I was only asking because I read through you're replies and it wasn't obvious if you advocating helmet use by law or personal responsibility.

I'm not really advocating anything in particular, just making the observation that when I see cyclists skip red lights, it makes me panic a little because it seems like a lot of them have very little awareness over how quickly things can turn bad on the road. Doing so whilst also not wearing any protective gear changes my perception of such behaviour from 'short-sighted potentially fatal mistake' to 'dangerous levels of stupidity'.

&gt; Passing a law like that would very likely cause cyclists to be less safe on the road and more likely to be killed.

Nothing exists in isolation. Better safety standards are a good thing in my book, but there's no substitute for personal responsibility. The differences between riding a bike and driving a car are self evident, and the only reason to enforce a helmet law is basically to force people to take some degree to protect themselves. It won't stop a cyclist being ejected from their bike, or going through a windscreen, or anything like that, so it is not the same thing as a seatbelt law and I don't think the two are equivalent.

However, I do not dismiss the notion out of hand. I just think the whole concept of bicycles sharing the same space as multi-ton high speed death machines is one fraught with danger, and that it would be better if bicycle users had their own dedicated riding space, in which case the helmet 'issue' would be much reduced as far as I'm concerned, since you can't outlaw risk.",null,0,null,1439906894,null,null,false,0,cu7178s,null,t3_3hffzo,null,null,null,t1_cu70rm7,null,null,null,1441321629,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null
null,null,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"I really, really don't agree with  using the Stoke and Palace games from last season as a benchmark of performances when by that point we had clearly thrown in the towel on the season and couldn't be bothered to give a shit. 

Our defense is better because Clyne has been superb and Gomez decent. We've did well at Stoke to hold on to a clean sheet, but they were missing the entire spine of their team. I'm not arguing we we have extra quality when I say we were lucky to win. Our players are clearly better than theirs, but that doesn't win games. 

Tactically we were awful for 70 minutes. We couldn't get the ball out of our half without punting it. 

&gt; We look much more solid with Clyne and Gomez in the full back positions and with Henderson/Milner/Can in midfield. Attacking wise, we will improve. Benteke already looks good. Firmino will add a lot of creativity and Sturridge is still to come back. 

You're essentially agreeing with me here when I say we only look better because we have better players. We still are far too slow in buildup to attacks, we still actually haven't had a test for our defense so to call it fixed already is way too premature. We've had hairy moments against a weakened Stoke and Johnson probably should have scored his chance, and should have conceded to Bournemouth.

TL;DR We don't look better yet defensively, as we've played 2 teams lacking attacking options and have been fortunate in both games not concede. All the while not creating many chances to score too, exactly like last season.

I agree that not everything Corbyn has ever said will work perfectly or possibly even be practical to attempt. I agre he doesn't have all the answers for the problems he's pointed out.

But the same can be said for every politician who ever stood for office. The article even admits that Osbourne made promises before the election that were immedietly ignored in his first budget. He writes ""This is the kind of wishful thinking that all parties indulged in during the election campaign."" 

I think where we disagree is that I don't see a problem with Corbyn not having a fully costed practical manifesto for 2020 yet. He's only just stepped into the public eye. I'm frankly amazed he's been able to come up with the ideas he has, compared with the other candidates who have very little even slightly concrete to say. 

If Corbyn wins he and an experienced and savvy team will have five years to come up with a full 2020 manifesto able to stand up to the scrutiny of his fiercest critics. Right now, all I'm looking for is a candidate with the right ideology, approach, passion and grit to fight the fight.

null,null,dang94,EN,england,null,"&gt; Yes at the time Luiz was a better player than Stones is now

Probably, he had a lot more experience I agree, was a more talented ball-player, was more versatile, but in terms of doing the job that a centre-back is actually meant to, there is absolutely no doubt that Stones is a better *defensive* player in that his positioning, awareness and concentration are not under constant questioning. If you're a newish fan and don't remember how much stick Luiz used to get for us with regards to his defending then fair enough. You enjoy repeating all the factors that contributed to Luiz's price but refuse to acknowledge the defensive flaws which were the entire reason why people found that price so hilarious. Again, if you weren't a fan/a member of the community back then then fair enough, you couldn't have known (here's an insight http://footballburp.com/jokes/the-best-david-luiz-psg-jokes-after-50m-deal/) Similarly, other things go into Stones' price (his nationality, his homegrown status, his age etc.) its unfortunate but you have to make allowances in the fee for that. You're always going to pay more for an English 7/10 than a foreign 8/10.

I firmly believe that people would take a 21 y.o. promising homegrown Stones under the Stewardship of Mourinho and Terry, over the return of a 28 y.o. foreign Luiz who is now famous for his defensive frailties. You can disagree, everyone has an opinion.

Lastly, so you're saying that the Germany game has no relevance on whether his price was fair? So because Torres was a proven goalscorer before signing for us, ¬£50m was a fair price for him? If Costa had come and barely scored, ¬£32m would still be above mockery because he'd done well before that? How a player performs after transferring is  just about the **only** relevant thing when determining if the price was fair, sure, you pay what you think the player is worth but to say that the Germany game had no relevance on whether he was worth ¬£50m is garbage.

Their periods of dominating possession came in the first 10 minutes or so of the first half and the first 20 minutes of the second half, and the last five minutes. They planned to put the high intensity press out for these periods so they could take a goal and hold it. We defended and then controlled the ball a lot in our periods. The goal that we scored was offside true, but it's not as if we didn't create good clear chances, on another night Benteke doesn't hit the bar, coutinho doesn't put it wide when he's through.

&gt;I firmly believe that people would take a 21 y.o. promising homegrown Stones under the Stewardship of Mourinho and Terry, over the return of a 28 y.o. foreign Luiz who is now famous for his defensive frailties. You can disagree, everyone has an opinion.

i have never disagreed with this you idiot. stop putting words into my mouth. i replied to somebody elses comment not yours saying its is wrong that people are using Luiz's price tag to justify ¬£40m or more for Stones.

Last point you're stupid. im talking about the price PSG paid for him and its got nothing to do with the Brazil match because it happened after you plonk. Thats what im saying even said 100 times that Luiz was not worth 50M yet you're telling me that im saying it was a fair price ffs. Thats the whole point of my reply to somebody else, not to you, that Luiz's over priced fee does not mean Stones is worht anywhere near that. I wish somebody else could help me because its like talking to a brick wall. nothing gets through to you. I said the germany match has no relevance on why PSG paid ¬£50M for him because it fucking happened after they bought him. how thick are you that you cant get that? I have never said he was worth ¬£50M so stop putting words into my mouth, ive said the exact opposite this whole time yet you are arguing with something i haven't said.

And you've ignored me twice now. You said you dont think Stones is worth over ¬£30M yet you're telling my Im calling him over rated and Im wrong for saying hes not worth anywhere near what Luiz went for. you are a moron.

null,null,ex-turpi-causa,null,null,null,"&gt; I think where we disagree is that I don't see a problem with Corbyn not having a fully costed practical manifesto for 2020 yet. He's only just stepped into the public eye. I'm frankly amazed he's been able to come up with the ideas he has, compared with the other candidates who have very little even slightly concrete to say. 

This just strikes me as a contradiction. No one expects a fully costed manifesto, but given the ideas put forward it doesn't hurt to speculate. There are only so many ways to do things. 

The contradiction is in supporting Corbyn's own vague ideas while acknowledging the others are also vague. But yeah, fair enough if you prefer the sound of Corbyn's ideas etc. That's just how it sort of works in the political arena. 

&gt; You say that Corbyn can spot all the problems, but you dismiss it by saying that's easy. I wouldn't dismiss that quality so readily. I see that as one of the most important qualities in a leader, along with the courage to attempt to tackle them.

I'm not just dismissing it because it is easy and the problems are superficially obvious. I'm dismissing it because his answers aren't even remotely reasonable or thought through. They basically amount to the same tired politics everyone perpetuates -- if it looks broken, point the finger at the other guy, when your ""solutions"" fail, sweep this under the rug and point the finger at the other guy.

I'm not too concerned about Arsenal game. They've looked way shakier than us and don't show the ferocity they did last season. Players like Ramsey and Sanchez will always cause problems but I feel we're in a way better place than we were the last time we played them.

Brendan is placing players in the right positions and getting quality from most. I love the commanding presence of Hendo and Milner in midfield that was lacking last season even in the best moments of the 3-4-3 formation.

Anyway there are several things to work on. Firstly, Lallana and Ibe whose performances are yet to impress, especially Lallana. He's never fully convinced me during his spell at Liverpool but I feel he's showing more shakiness than the rest of the players and past versions of himself. I'd guess he'd prefer a position where he's situated closer to midfield but he simply looks uneasy most times he moves forward. If I were Brendan I'd consider using a replacement. The space between Coutinho and Benteke is what is causing the most trouble since wings have been unefficient causing wing-backs and mids to forcibly move forward in order to be dangerous and this can create some serious problems in the long term.

Regardless, Brendan has built himself a great squad with Clyne, Benteke, Milner and Gomez capable of great things. Solving minor flaws in our offense and keeping our current defensive department clean (although Lovren's position could be improved slghtly) we could be looking at the best LFC team we've seen in years.

null,null,HashPram,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt; You may think it obvious to state that Britain is frightened  
  
I think that to state ""Britain is frightened"" is a massive over-simplification. Some people in Britain may be personally frightened, some may be professionally cautious. Doesn't mean that all Britain is frightened all of the time all for the same reason.  
  
&gt; Just the word ""Islam"" evokes fear in the majority of the people I meet  
  
I'm probably not one of the people he's met then because I think Islam, and religion in general, are laughable.  
It's difficult to be afraid of something you think is laughable.  
  
&gt; That the British are too afraid to host cartoons cannot be brushed over.  
  
The British weren't afraid of anything. Specific British authorities might have been. Conflating one with the other makes this appear a different problem from the one it actually is.

null,null,Sentinel677,null,null,null,"WRT the 2020 election and Corbyn scaring off vital Conservative voters, I'm pretty certain that a strategy predicated on winning over the right-wingers is likely doomed to failure. Hell, to be completely honest, given that Labour lost in 2015 and there is every reason to think that 2020 will be a harder fight, unless something drastic happens Labour is probably going to lose in 2020 no matter who becomes leader.

I doubt any of them can win, so the best choice to me is the one that I think will do the best in opposition, which is Corbyn. If the last five years are anything to go by the Blairites just don't have it in them to really disagree with the Tories, because in private, they don't really disagree with the Tories.

That's what the people advocating for the play-it-safe/Blairite strategy consistently miss IMO. Blairism only worked because Blair was a good enough salesman that he was able to get voters that ordinarily leaned Tory to consider him. That was an incredibly difficult thing to achieve, do you honestly think Burnham, Kendal or Cooper are up to it? I don't.

Remember this isn't the 90's. To the layperson the economy is doing good enough (and Labour has accepted the narrative put forward by their opponents that they are/were economically incompetent without a fight) and, far more importantly, the Conservatives now are unified, confident and have just been delivered their first majority in almost twenty years; as opposed to the late nineties/early 2000's where they were a demoralised disintegrating mess with a succession of non-entities for leaders.

'Blairism' did not win three elections. Blair did. As much as we may hate him (and God do I hate him) you have ackowledge that in those early years he was a pretty charismatic figure and Kendall/Burnham/Cooper don't have a chance in hell of matching that.

TL;DR None of them will win but Corbyn is the best choice for an opposition leader.

null,null,tyke-of-yorkshire,null,null,null,"&gt; I think you're inferring things that I'm not saying. To clarify, we taxpayers already subsidise the train companies to the tune of roughly ¬£4bn a year. To put that in perspective, ¬£4.91bn is spent on JSA per year. From this ¬£4bn, nearly ¬£200 million of this went directly to shareholders as a dividend.

That's a misleading. There's about ¬£400m a year of private investment into UK railways, so the ¬£200m of profit is a return on that investment. That's ¬£400m we would no longer get if we nationalised them. 

&gt; So to answer your question, yes, I would. If that is what it takes to actually improve the rail network. I've seen year on year increases in ticket price, to no real tangible benefit in the quality of the rolling stock, cleanliness of train stations, not to mention punctuality of services. I'd like to see my money actually do something. Instead, I'm left with a rather sour taste in my mouth that I'm being taken for a ride.

I also don't buy that it would improve the rail network. The ticket prices don't see much per passenger benefit, because the spending is mainly going to expanding capacity as the number of rail trips is rocketing. Most railways I know are expanding station length and buying new carriages for longer trains. That's where all the money is going and that's where it would still have to go in public ownership. Investment in UK railways clearly went up after privatisation:

He hasn't been good since his transfer because when he left, he was coming back from an illness (I believe two times actually since he was supposed to play in this December cup fixture but suddenly got pulled out last minute). Coming back from an injury and with the little playing time he got from us, it was no wonder it was going to take a while to adjust. 

There's been too much revisionist nonsense about him since he's not a Chelsea player anymore. If he has too many gaps in his game, what about Willian (who's defended to the death around here because of his work rate)? Schurrle might not have as good of a touch, might not track back as much (in this comparison, still does it a lot more than most wingers) and may lose the ball more often compared to Willian, but his strengths compared to Willian make it a legitimate argument who's better. I think his off the ball runs, positioning, finishing ability and aggressiveness would make for a better fit if given a fair string of games with actual playing time.

Also, this whole reputation that he's nothing more than a super sub who otherwise gets gassed at 60 minutes is just flat out wrong just because he's used that way for Germany and was used that way at Chelsea.

It was more ""fuck the tories"" than confidence in the plan set out, realistically the party left behind should have been irrelevant to the focus of the plan for independent Scotland.

The yes campaign took delight in informing people of a kind of a bizarre utopian Scotland (which is fine when you are running for office but horrifically misleading when breaking a country up) that they didn't even really explain in their plans, just a lot of ""this could happen if we did"" etc. They skirted around a lot of the specific details that are needed and that made a lot of people uneasy to  the idea of an independent Scotland. Hence the no result.

It only took a few months for oil prices to plummet, the odd ""dont worry, dont worry we will have enough money from oil guys"" argument was dead, not to mention short sighted as the world is slowly beginning to move away from fossil fuels.

I mean im shocked they didnt get a yes vote, even though it would have been dire for their country. The yes team had an easier argument and could paint a picture of a better tomorrow, which cameron etc couldn't really do. ""more of the same"" is a harder argument than ""change for the better""

Additionally, I think Talisca from Benfica would be someone worth at least inquiring about, but I am afraid he would cost a small fortune.

I'd like to say we could look at Franco Vasquez as an alternative attacking option, but if I'm being honest I haven't seen enough of him to make an informed opinion. He looks really good on paper, but we all know how those things can turn out.

Also, can someone explain to me why we're willing to shell out 30 million pounds for someone like Stones, when we could be going after an arguably better defender like Laporte. (Plus that bonus future French connection with Zouma.)

Still think we should be looking at Ricardo Rodriguez out of Wolfsburg. Don't think just one fullback is going to solve our defensive dilemma, and he could yet again serve to improve our set pieces.

If I could have ANY player, honestly it would be Verratti, but we'll probably sign Pogba before we sign Verratti, and neither of those will happen so there's hardly any point in mentioning it. A man can dream though.

I have the MK2 Leon Cupra, and it is a brilliant car in general. Though it has suffered from some of the aforementioned problems that VW just can't be bothered to fix. However, if I could use hindsight to re-buy, I would definitely take the Golf over the Seat, the build quality and general feel is just so much better, despite being on the same platform.

Therefore the question becomes, why have they done this?  I'm actually of the opinion that David Cameron probably [hasn't changed his opinion](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-contender-calls-for-more-liberal-drug-laws-6143525.html) on drugs (especially given the rather high odds that he, gideon and boris all enjoyed the odd line in their younger days), but rather he's now hamstrung by political realities which limit the options reasonably open to him.  Therefore a bill like this makes perfect sense.  It offers the opportunity for the party to be *seen* to be doing something about the explosion of legal highs (Daily Mail coverage of the bill has been very positive), while in practical terms they're basically maintaining the status quo.

I'm sorry but I just don't see this in anything Corbyn has said. It's definitely part of the right-wing rhetoric who regularly blames immigrants and welfare-recipients for the country's problems. But as far as I've heard and read from him, Corbyn doesn't blame everything on the banks or the wealthy. Maybe people are seeing some kind of class-war attack hidden behind his measured suggestions that the most wealthy should pay the most tax, and that corporations should pay half a percent more corporation tax than they currently do (but still far less than other countries). But I'm afraid I don't see anything other than reasonable suggestions that many people seem to actually agree with.

It definitely could be a function of not getting regular minutes but lacking natural fitness doesn't play well with me when his inconsistency is what keeps him off the field--thereby making it difficult him to attain appropriate game fitness.  Looking at your game log from 2013, he was subbed about half his games--I am not sure that's enough to draw conclusions about his stamina either way. 

An any case, Schurrle is a guy I feel you either get an amazing game out of or you must recognize it is an inconsistent day and and sub him at half time.  For me, we just don't have that kind of luxury.  

Just reminder of who is on the first team right now and can play right wing:

Willian, Juan Cuadrado, Kenedy, Victor Moses, Traor√©, Lo√Øc R√©my, Ramires

I'd love to see more Moses (Stoke's best player last season) and Kenedy (saw in-person against Barca and played surprisingly well and with confidence).

Carroll and Alli could have been chosen over Dier in midfield against United but were overlooked. Or either one of them could have played on the right leaving Dembele to play in the centre. But fair enough, that selection could be explained by missing unfit players.

But against Stoke? Lamela or maybe Townsend or Pritchard, or again Carrol or Alli, could have played wide instead of Dembele, leaving him free to play in the centre. More importantly, Bentaleb could have played there alongside Mason instead of losing his place to him. But neither of them did, it was Dier again instead. The only way that makes sense to me is if the plan is to bring in another central midfielder whose game has more in common with the way Dier has been operating there.

I'd love to think Dembele will be given another chance at CM, but I think it's clear Pochettino at least doesn't see him as a starter alongside Bentaleb/Mason in that role.

I don't think Pochettino would agree that having Dier as 3rd/4th choice CB and secondish choice DM would be a bad thing - he notoriously prefers a compact squad (much as Mourinho does) and would likely see that as economical rather than risky, as well as a situation that would put Dier on the pitch more often.

And Dembele starting wide does make some sense without assuming it was a decision forced on him by players being unfit if you know Pochettino's history; he did exactly the same thing very often while at Southampton with Davis, a player who's far from a proper winger.",null,0,null,1439912353,null,null,1439912616,0,cu74i8b,null,t3_3hd6gm,null,null,null,t1_cu71cd7,null,null,null,1441323251,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

The performance level notably in defence has significantly dropped. Ivanovic in particular was torrid. Gomis/Aguero constantly kept getting in behind Cahill/Terry and causing significant trouble. Jose subbing of Terry is telling. Jose needs to fix this and I'm not sure spending the majority of our money (¬£35-40m?) on Stones will fix this. Stones was great last year, but not that great.

Labour did ok in England if they hadn't lost any seats in scotland they would have done better than Gordon brown did.

&gt;Following the Labour party whip isn't going to win Scotland back, so suggesting that Scots fall in line and stop having representatives that actually try and represent them in parliament is a non-starter.

You haven't understood what i'm saying. Scotland can have have a party that represents them but it can't do it at the expense of the rest of the country. For example New Labour was a very Scottish centric party ( 2 scotish PMs, implement devolution, set up barnet which was was a sweet deal for scotland, house of lords reform etc) but it never explicitly stated it would put people livening in scotland ahead of everyone else, it was a UK party, so it had UK wide support.

The reason why Firmino and Can looked good when they came on at Stoke wasn't only because Lallana and Ibe are literally shit - they also came on in the end of the game. Chances are, Ibe would've looked amazing if he was subbed on at 80' as well. Now, Firmino looked good against Bournemouth as well, but he hasn't looked great yet.

The team selection against Bournemouth wasn't completely retarded either. You could argue against it, but it does make sense in a lot of ways. These first four games are important and a good reason for playing Ibe and Lallana is that they're used to playing there. Introducing Firmino, Can (as a DM) apart from Benteke, Clyne and Gomez is very risky. It also gives Ibe a good chance to get a run of games, something which will arguably be a lot harder as Firmino (probably) takes a spot in the first team and with Sturridge coming back. 

Apart from that: The back four have looked solid, or at least decent. Especially Lovren has been good. And most importantly, we've been winning two games and keeping clean sheets.

I expect Rodgers to keep the same line-up against Arsenal. Maybe he'll get Can in there. But apart from that, I'd be fine with the same line-up. Get Ibe some time on the pitch, give the team some time to gel properly. If things look bad, throw in Firmino, maybe Ings in a 4-4-2 diamond and see what they can do.

Why should a taxpayer in the poor rural parts of Scotland be out of pocket so the rich set of Surrey and Oxforshire can hop on the train to London quite a bit cheaper? 

Businesses in well-off parts of the country should cough up the money if they want their workers to get to work. The taxpayers should stop subsidizing their expenses. 

&gt; An average English journey is subsidised by the state to the tune of ¬£2.19, compared to ¬£7.60 in Scotland and ¬£9.33 in Wales. 

&gt; While many London-bound passengers are currently shouldering more of the funding burden than travellers in, say, Aberystwyth, the subsidy disparity means much-needed local services to the likes of Giggleswick and Cark can be run even at times when the routes are not funding themselves. The numbers will also vary depending on which lines are being upgraded or require lots of maintenance.

Gomez - Young. Decent. Nothing more really to be said. I'd like to see Moreno play because offensively Gomez seems very limited, and defensively he's made a couple mistakes (sagged off a little too much off his man, not spaced right, pulled out wide, etc). Although to be fair I'm not sure Moreno's much better and he's a natural LB. 

Benteke - Absolutely brilliant at winning headers. Link up play is good, but I think he's still gelling as we haven't seen the best of him. First touch has been worse than I expected. Can't comment on much else as he's had pretty limited service so far. I love his work ethic though. I'm happy with him, although so far he's not looked like a 32m pound man (or at least not been given a chance to look like one).

Firminio - No clue. Seen very little from him, and hasn't had a chance to express himself. I like his work rate, and he seems up for the physical challenge which is brilliant. But I'm not sure how people on here are saying that he looks incredible when he hasn't even shown his ability yet.

I know the popular left-wing feeling is that immigration is amazing and should be lapped up, but at that sort of volume and speed, it's bad for most people.

Building a shitload more houses is one oft-mooted option, but the trouble with building for people capable of migrating is that they might not still be there when you've finished building.

I do agree that over time players become more familiar with other players- they figure out where they are runs, how they like to receive the ball, which foot they are more dominant with, things of that nature.  So I agree time together for these sorts of things is good.

Where I disagree a bit is that it should take significant time to get used to a managers tactics.  For me, that's crap and is a sign of overly complex tactical decisions by the manager that are unneeded.  These guys are all highly paid professional footballers who have done nothing but live the game day in, day out for literal years under various managers and coaches- if it takes more than a few hours to explain what and where they should be on the pitch, then the system sucks in my opinion.

She has only just been accepted for PIP this month, which is great, but they refused to backdate it from the original application date (way back in March) even though the form said it would be.

The form and the whole process is indeed designed to catch you out, as the article suggests. A few years ago she made the mistake of being honest on the previous benefit application (DLA).

For example, the question would be ""In the last 6 months, have you walked more than 100m unaided?"" and the true answer would be yes (because a lot happens in 6 months), but most days she cannot walk more than a few metres without collapsing.
But if you answer yes, the result comes back that you can walk 100m unaided and therefore do not qualify for enhanced benefit.

What she did this time was use the Citizens Advice Bureau. They set up two appointments and filled out the form with her, as they knew what the correct answers should be, from her describing her difficulties. They did not lie, as far as I know, but they knew how to phrase it to get the right attention. I do not think that this is cheating, as she is unable to work at all, and only has occasional days where mobility is decent enough to move around for more than a few minutes.

Some kind of box-ticker person visited her home to interview her after the form had been submitted, and she was advised by CAB to not answer the door, get someone else to do it, don't get up off the couch etc. Don't give them any excuse to mark down that you can do things. And in the end it worked, this time.

They'd still have lost and we'd still have a tory majority.  So it's not simply a case of tactically voting Labour in Scotland to prevent a tory government.

&gt;You haven't understood what i'm saying. Scotland can have have a party that represents them but it can't do it at the expense of the rest of the country. For example New Labour was a very Scottish centric party ( 2 scotish PMs, implement devolution, set up barnet which was was a sweet deal for scotland, house of lords reform etc) but it never explicitly stated it would put people livening in scotland ahead of everyone else.

I'm not entirely sure what you're going for here.  Let's break it down:

- 2 Scottish PMs - irrelevant

- Implementing devolution - Manifesto commitment and there was a Northern England devolution referendum in 2004 which failed.  So not sure that's evidence of New Labour favouring Scots.

- Set up Barnett formula - Implemented by Labour in 1978, about 15 years before ""New Labour"".  Thatcher's conservative government continued the Barnett formula.  Not really a New Labour scheme to favour Scots.

- House of Lords reform - What does this have to do with Scotland?

When have the SNP explicitly stated they would put people living in Scotland ahead of everyone else?  Pretty sure they the polices they advocate in Westminster they'd like to see applied across the board, not just Scotland.

&gt;Its not hate its a rational assessment of the SNPs position people don't want to be governed by a group whos stance is they don't care what happens to them.

If it's not hate, don't use the word hate to describe it.  ""England hates nationalists its a deal breaker""

Lots of this unskilled labour supply comes from Eastern Europe as they can earn a multiple of their salary back home. Amazon have little incentive to make the working conditions any better. In fact, if they doubled the labour salary without good reason, they would be doing a injustice to their share holders.

Seen a lot of people complaining about our squad vs the ones we'll be competing with (hopefully) but as far as I can see the only team that's noticeably stronger than us on paper is Everton, and even they crapped out last season.

Assuming we sign a good CB where we finish this season will boil down to management, tactics, individual's form, injuries and luck.

Perhaps it's just that I don't see what Labour has done to be scorned so much in Scotland, relative to the SNP.

I thought it was interesting how divisive it was.  Sure, we'd be dividing Scotland from England, but also it meant I, who was happy with everything just being how it was, now became a 'unionist'.  I found it difficult to relate to people who got swept up in it, believing that independence would enable Scotland to somehow come out ahead, despite the financials not adding up.  I found it difficult to relate to the charges of 'scaremongering' which seemed to be the standard reply to people pointing out that things might not go well.

The SNP might not keep mentioning it but that's really their cause for existence.  When I was growing up in Edinburgh in the 80's they were a fringe party, and perhaps because I don't live there anymore, I don't see what the SNP offer that makes them so attractive to voters.

null,null,ThePoeticMotion,null,null,null,"It was more a desperate attempt to convince an ambitious player to stay than a disrespectful dig, but when Tim Sherwood warned Christian Benteke that Liverpool might not be his ideal destination because they cross the ball less than anyone else, the Aston Villa manager was one among many outside Anfield who doubted the towering forward would be an ideal fit.

After 26 minutes of his home debut, Benteke and Liverpool delivered the perfect riposte. The Belgium forward‚Äôs first goal for his new club, scored in front of the Kop, was significant enough but it was the source ‚Äî a deep cross from the left to the far post by Jordan Henderson ‚Äî that was most revealing: Liverpool were showing signs of how to bring the best out of the second most expensive signing in the club‚Äôs history.

Brendan Rodgers‚Äôs faith that this would happen had never wavered during a lengthy pursuit of the striker, even when Villa made it clear that Benteke would only be allowed to leave if his ¬£32.5 million buyout clause was triggered. At that point, Rodgers could have examined other options, players who would cost less and add less pressure to his own position, but the Liverpool manager remained adamant that Benteke was the only one he wanted and the deal was sanctioned.

Having had his judgment backed so emphatically, Rodgers faced the challenge of ensuring the most expensive purchase of his career did not become a noose around his neck. The scenario was quite simple ‚Äî should Benteke fail then the rope would tighten, succeed and the chances were it would be removed altogether. As well as receiving support from his employers, this was Rodgers backing himself and the early signs are that his confidence in Benteke does not seem misplaced.

Twenty years ago, it took only a matter of months for another forward expensively signed by Liverpool from a Midlands club to be left complaining that he had been bought without a plan of how to get the best out of him. It is the fate suffered by Stan Collymore, from Nottingham Forest, that Liverpool do not want to repeat with Benteke, which is why Rodgers has gone to great lengths to devise a system that will allow his striker to flourish.

The 4-1-4-1 formation that Rodgers has favoured since Benteke‚Äôs arrival has one aim ‚Äî to ensure that Liverpool have both the necessary width to provide the 24-year-old the crosses he thrives upon without reducing the number of players able to support him from central areas. Although Bournemouth handled the approach well enough during the opening period, when they dominated possession, Liverpool gradually built their game around Benteke‚Äôs presence and the dynamic was changed.

At times it was a towering header from a long punt forward, at others it was a deft backheel to link play with Philippe Coutinho but, whatever the mode, Benteke was becoming increasingly difficult to handle.

By giving Liverpool the option to mix things up, their new signing also rendered obsolete Rodgers‚Äôs claim, early in his Anfield tenure, that there was no Plan B because ‚ÄúPlan B is to make Plan A better.‚Äù Not that Rodgers will mind, if Benteke continues in this vein.",null,0,null,1439916036,null,null,false,0,cu76z3a,null,t3_3hgqsz,null,null,null,t3_3hgqsz,null,null,null,1441324415,null,37,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,37,null

Martha was interesting because she could've been set up to be the second Rose, as she did have an attraction to the Doctor, but he was still stuck on the loss of Rose. Martha grew emensely as a character and I loved how she was the one sometimes saving the Doctor, instead of the other way around like with Rose, Donna, Amy, and etc...

&gt;&gt; I wish I could have shipped Amy and 11 like I ship Rose and 10.

I actually don't ship Rose and *9* (don't like 10)... Rose is a whiny and all doe eyed ""save me""... Im tired of seeing that written for female characters...

&gt;&gt; Capaldi is still not a prettyboy.

Eccleston was DEFINITELY NOT a pretty boy, and I loved him as the doctor. Personally the way Matt Smith's doctor was written and acted became the way that I identify with the Doctor, his emotions, his ego, his jokes/sense of humor, he was cheeky, and he still had this sense of wanting to help people. Yes, he was in a younger body, but still a very old man, but I liked the juxtaposition of his character. But what I loved most about Eccleston were those exact qualities that *to me* are who the Doctor is as a character. That flick of emotion like a light switch, the sense of youngness, but old wisdom, the ego, fun, and always wanting to see something exciting and new! That's how I identify him. Not grumpy, careless, sarcastic and sometimes an asshole and I don't like the way he uses Clara. I personally don't like how Capaldi's character is written. Not because he isn't a ""pretty boy""...

&gt;&gt; I grew out of the show I liked as a kid and blame Moffat for it.

Nah, I just think the writing is going down...

&gt;&gt; I liked 11 and Clara because I only care about shipping.

I liked how 11 cared about Clara, the same way he cared about Amy Pond...

&gt;&gt; Danny Pink was black like Martha and Mickey, but because he was a Moffat character, he sucked.

Danny Pink is whiny, and stubborn. I think his relationship with Clara was SO FORCED and they had no chemistry. Or at least I didn't see or feel chemistry...  and his plotline was POINTLESS! I like characters Moffat has created and some storylines, I just think it's time to pass the torch, he's ran his course... RTD had it for 4 series, this is his 4th series coming up, it's time to let go...""let somebody else try""

If you own property in London rent controls will mean your property being devalued over night and there still won't any solution to the demand issue.

If you don't and you work in London you have to watch obscene amounts of your income disappear on rent.

If you believe in social solidarity then watching social housing disappear from central london is not just strategically bad planning it is literally stealing from previous generations who went to war to protect this country and stealing from the children growing up here. In what way can I be expected to treat someone civilly if what they are advocating is a great big fuck you to our ancestors and to our children's future? 

What I am saying is that politics should be passionate. The future is at stake. Our livelihoods and savings are at stake, our health services and schools are at stake.

The only thing I'm against is downvoting well argued opinions even if you disagree strongly.

So her three claims to radicalism:

1) Extending sure start instead of nationalising the energy sector.

So it would be great to give sure start the money it needs to actually be an effective service but is giving more money to an existing service really radical? 

Also this isn't overly a fair comparison, what radical thing does she plan to do about ownership of the economy - nothing at all. What does she plan to do about the uncompetitive market on energy and rising energy costs - nothing at all.

2) Not re-opening coal mines. Sounds good from a Green viewpoint but she goes on to say she wants to invest in clean coal and campaign to keep her local coal mine open. Clean coal is an expensive non-renewable option that keeps us dependent on overseas fossil fuels - not radical, not green, not sensible.

She does suggest she might invest in other green tech jobs which is good, but this isn't going to help depressed ex-mining  communities which much.

3) Being a women not a man. This is true, but its also true of Thatcher and Angela Merkel so not such a great point.

So I initially responded to this, within about an hour of it being originally posted.  I've been out of any kind of kitchen role for years, but I've been intentionally looking for a change and a part time gig at Cahoots seemed like something that would either be interesting and maybe develop, or be interesting and at least be bringing some cash in.  I covered all of that, and basically waited to see what happened.

The next day I got a response that basically amounted to ""we're small, this is a very basic role, it's probably not what you're looking for.""  All of that is completely fair enough, but over the last two months I've been told ""you're overqualified"" or that I'll get bored at least a dozen times.  I responded to the Cahoots chap with this, along with an intended-to-be-funny quip about how I was previously unaware that entertainment pays rent.

I would have been fine with all this; completely their prerogative, until I get a response on Sunday that amounted to ""why not"" and to send an email and CV to a Cahoots-domain email and that they could set up a trial the next day/monday.  I did, summed up all of my relevant background... and nothing.  No response at all.

So all in all, pretty damn frustrating.  If someone is going to inquire about a job washing dishes, almost anyone is going to be overqualified; we know this, the employer know this.  If you happen to find someone not qualified for this, then congrats you've found a Unicorn.  What we as the job seekers don't want is to be jerked around like this.  If I've already passed several messages back and forth and you're mentioning setting up a test meeting, don't just fade away into nowhere.  It's incredibly frustrating, and it's also unprofessional.

The sweetie you can't have is hard left politics; you need a heart transplant because hard left politics will take the country in the wrong direction according to Blair.

If Tony Blair sent you an email telling you to fuck off I'd consider that abuse. And let's be clear, were those comments sexist? No, unlike some of the abuse from Corbyn supporters on twitter. Are they calling for a purge? No, unlike some of the comments from supporters of Corbyn on twitter. Are they racist or anti-semitic? No, unlike the Corbyn supporters who've been tweeting at Cathy Newman calling her a zionist shill since last night.

AND it's irrelevant to point out that randoms on twitter are different to public figures in the context of an article talking about online abuse from supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. If you're angry because Blair and Umunna 'started it' you can respond to them directly on twitter rather than calling some local councillor/Liz supporter a tory.

The fact is people liked many of Labour's policies but didn't trust us on the economy and disagreed with us on welfare.

Corbyn's personality will probably be a more appealing than Miliband's. However, polls show few people in England didn't vote for Miliband because he was insufficiently left wing.

* Upside
  * Fast enough to cope with routing packets from WAN to LAN at &gt; 100Mbit/s speeds [1]
  * Gigabit ethernet switch internally
  * USB ports
  * Supports OpenWRT
* Downside
  * Not the newest router on the block
  * Wireless performance is not the full 300Mbit/s advertised when using OpenWRT because of driver issues

Can't speak to the usefulness of the supplied firmware - I reflashed it straight out of the box for OpenWRT. That's the main reason I selected this model, I was running OpenWRT for about 10 years before on the router it replaced (which is now a switch downstairs on the other end of my powerline dongle). 

The flexibility of a router you control absolutely to me was more important than the latest hardware or performance - the wireless speeds I was getting already were more than enough for SD streaming of Netflix on my Wii.

So, it's an excellent choice for a heavy duty nerd.

null,null,RSeymour93,flair8,,null,"I don't care all that much about net spend. I care about having a sustainable long term plan while being smart about addressing short term needs. If we have a good team with plenty of spare parts, and we sell 8 spare parts for ¬£35M and spend ¬£30m bringing in a star player at our one big hole and ¬£10m on depth and prospects, that's a good window in my mind even thought we finished with +¬£5m spend.

Conversely if the team is a mess and filled with old players and we sell a few guys for ¬£15m and spend ¬£60m on a half dozen players while still having major holes and an unbalanced squad, that's not a good window in my book even though our net was -¬£45m.

It's all about the context of the team we have, the urgency of the needs, and exactly who's gone out and who's come in. After the Gareth Bale Seven fiasco (I think at this point it's safe to render that judgment) I'm all for Levy being cautious and selective about who he brings in and at what price _when the urgency of the need is such that we can afford such patience*.

If Levy deserves criticism this window it's not because there's a +16m net spend with weeks to go in the window, it's because he came into this offseason with (IMO) four major, clearcut needs:

- A good to great DC.
- A good to great DM or defensively-oriented box to box type.
- A fair to great Striker.
- A fair to great Winger.

(backup right fullback was also a need but IMO that slot could have waited until deadline day if need be)

I think the first three needs (DC, DM, Striker) needed to be addressed early in the window, so that we had the players ready for game 1 of the season. Levy went 1 for 3 on that score. Right now he's 2 for 4 overall (or 3 for 4 if you view N'jie as sufficient to cover both Wing and Striker, though I think we need another body and that 2 for 4 is more accurate).

There's so much smoke regarding adding another Striker or Striker/Winger that I feel confident that's going to get done before the deadline with *some* striker or another... and if Levy ends up signing a DM, which seems more likely than not but not certain, he'll have filled the five biggest needs in the squad while moving on a bunch of spare pieces for what seem like decent prices.

Personally, it's the delay in bringing in a DM/defensive-oriented MC (and the possibility that we will fail to do so altogether) that bothers me the most. We've got a ridiculous number of guys who, when they play MC, are best suited as the attack-oriented MC (correct me if I'm wrong, but Alli, Pritchard, Carroll, Dembele and Bentaleb all seem to fit into this category) but we're thin with respect to defense-oriented midfielders. I think the team badly needs a stabilizing defensive workhorse in midfield (and I don't think we should be relying on the Dier experiment as sufficient to address the need). If it's one who can provide veteran leadership and confidence, all the better.

If Levy had signed Alderweireld, Berahino and, say, Sven Bender in June and July, waiting until deadline day for other additions would have been fine in my book, and I wouldn't really care what the net spend turned out to be as long as we didn't sell any of our frontline guys.",null,0,null,1439917510,null,null,1439918047,0,cu77zp6,null,t3_3hgcz1,null,null,null,t3_3hgcz1,null,null,null,1441324894,null,7,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,7,null

With Rahman LB, Dave RB then Iva, JT, Cahill and Zouma all competing for the CB positions, I think that's fine.

I also think moving Zouma into DMF in big games is a good option.

I think our biggest problem is ball retention and creativity, Fabregas looks an absolute shell of the player we saw at the start of last season and Hazard has been carrying the creative burden for far too long.

Part of that stems from the way in which Jose sets up, forcing Oscar Willian etc to do so much defesnive work.
But I also think it comes from the fact we are lacking a cultured CM who can pass and link the play between midfield and attack. Someone to compliment Fabregas essentially.

I think we should try and get rid of Mikel, Moses and Cudrado. None of them are good enough for a top European side imo. As replacements I'd love to see 1 or 2 of Griezmann, Reus, Pedro, Isco come in, although they would be marquee signings and difficult to pull off.

In CM I wish we had never sold De Bruyne, i'd love him back at the club, Verrati or Vidal would be a dream although very unlikely. Perhaps a genuine bid for Koke could happen?

There is something right about apologising when a mistake has been made. There needs to be a freedom to stop and search anybody. But not willy-nilly. And having to issue an apology when getting a search wrong should help hone police skills in reducing false positives.

Of course this may lead to a perverse situation where certain ethnicities are stopped more often than others - because they are statistically more likely to be carrying something illegal.

But before I posted I just remembered that people are stupid and believe what they want to believe. Saw a post in the palace subreddit about how we should be one of the easiest teams in the league to beat because we lost Benteke and Delph, without one single peraon taking any note of any of our new signings. People are too lazy to research anything for themself, and are all too easily throwing around analysis they have no input on but merely stole from some pundit. I dont care if Neville was commentating and raving about Uniteds midfield controlling the game, how about you watch the game for yourself and make up your own mind for once. Sometimes I wish that people would turn the commentary off for once and draw their own analysis, rather than soaking up every little bit of what will probably be an ex-player for one of the clybs playing who will most certainly have a bias.

 On another note I actually thought United were awful. They arent really missing any key creative players in the same way we are, yet they created only 2 more chances than us, and if the pundits and /r/soccer anlytic genius' are to be believed, a title chasing team vs a team destined for relegation. The lazy punditry all noted it all down to ""the beginning of the season"" and not anything to worry about. To me it reeks of our start to the last season, we averaged 1-2 shots on goal the first 4 games and racked up 10 points. We were being praised for getting the points and awarded Lambert a new contract. Fast forward a month or two and were still averaging 1 shot on goal a game, but averaging less than a point a game now. United this season have played 2 games, had 3 shots on goal, scored 1 goal (a deflection to boot), and racked up 6 points.

&gt;I suppose I‚Äôd insult Jeremy Corbyn if I compared him to an American. Jews (sorry ‚ÄòZionists‚Äô) and Ukrainians rank high in the far-left‚Äôs demonology. But Corbyn and his comrades agree that Americans are the worst.

&gt;So I should say that I mean no offence when I point out that ‚Äòif Corbyn were American‚Äô his campaign for the leadership of the Labour Party would make sense. In the United States, or any other presidential democracy, the winner of a party‚Äôs nomination selects his or her team from among their supporters. If they win power, they appoint their own cabinet. The executive and legislature are separate. Whatever deals they must cut with their senates or parliaments, the membership of their administration is ultimately their concern.

&gt;Hardly anyone voting for the next Labour leader appears to notice or care that Britain is a parliamentary democracy, where prospective leaders have to rely on the support of their colleagues in the parliamentary party.

&gt;I have not heard one Labour voter say that they are not voting for Corbyn because only two dozen members of the Parliamentary Labour Party wants him as leader. Labour voters are bringing a presidential mentality to a parliamentary system, and a thoroughly modern form of consumerism as well.

Aguero



I think we'll finish first and Everton at 6. or 7.

Our best player is hands down David Silva. He is magic and every single piece of attacking buisness we do somehow flows through the little spanish magician.

Even seeing Nevilles coverage on MNF last night, he was highlighting how good their shape was while showing a 10 second part of the game. Their defensive line was an absolute shambles, one player was keeping Gabby onside, and if Micah had of hit the bll over the top he was through on goal.


I think Neville is a big part of the problem. He is a good pundit who makes a lot of good points, but his bias towards Utd and his clear hatred of Liverpool really makes his statements questionable. When he says something on commentary or in the studio people take it as gold, very very rarely will you see people disagree. This is the case with Fridays game.

2) First.

3) Hard to say because you've left your transfer business quite late. If you keep Stones, and make some purchases like Kenwright says, I expect you, Saints Swansea and West Ham to be fighting for 7-10th and there to be not much in it. If you lose Stones possibly 10-12th. Sorry I realise that's not an optimistic prediction.

That part of the league is very congested this season. Swansea should be around 7th, but so should Saints and you. West Ham are looking good and Stoke are looking threatening, so I'm finding it hard to predict so early on. I'd love for you to finish 6th above Liverpool though.

4) David Silva, hands down. Possibly the most talented player to ever play for us.

5)Tough one, because I'd say Stones but now we've spent ¬£30m on Otamendi. Baines for Clichy or Coleman for Sagna maybe?

Or bring back Barry for sentimental reasons.

3) Anywhere from 1st to 3rd depending on injuries, if Aguero, Silva and Yaya stay fit and Kompany keeps up his form then 1st.

Well this is true, but how do you propose to fix that without serious economic and social consequences for our aged population? You can't lock the doors and force the people here to have more kids. We're a long way off reaching capacity; there is plenty of land still to be developed, if the population grows so does the economy so there is provision for expended health care, housing construction, education systems etc. Currently we need this immigration to pay for the old people in our society, it's not like we're close to a serious overpopulation problem and we'd be in big trouble if it stopped. I can't really see any alternative for the moment.

Your comment also implies that the UK will forever be a magnet for migration, which is probably unlikely in the long term as countries like China, India, the former eastern bloc etc. become more economically developed so that there are similar economic prospects for potential economic migrants elsewhere. If we do reach a point where the arrival of new immigrants hurts is economically (e.g. Job or housing market saturation; current short falls in both is entirely due to economic policy and not a simple supply and demand model) immigrants will move somewhere else where economic prospects are better.

&gt;I voiced my opinion for what it's worth earlier on with regards Denayer.

&gt;While I fully understand people's concerns over Denayer, surely the opportunity to sign one of Europe's top centre halves is too good to pass up?

&gt;Are those in the Denayer camp seriously suggesting that we don't sign this guy based on the following I'd call facts, others may call opinions.

&gt;1, Demichellis is turning 35 and has played an awful lot more football than even he would have expected. Surely months as opposed to seasons left in him at PL &amp; CL level.

&gt;2, Denayer has just turned 20, recently sign a 5 year deal, has one season under his belt in a near amature league and is very young to be considered even a regular sub at our level. Talented though he is.

&gt;3, Mangala has been encouraging this season but looked far from the finished article last season. For all any of us know, he's a 'Hull away' from regressing back to the promising yet raw defender we had last year. Hopefully not and I doubt he will. I'm a Magala fan.

&gt;4, Kompany was patchy at best last season and his injuries were the type of recurring injuries that can quickly become chronic or performance effecting.

&gt;Above are four reasons I believe signing Otamendi was a obvious call. City could be wrong, I could be wrong.

&gt;But based on those four fairly common opinions from last season it would be a big gamble in my opinion to turn down an opportunity as good as this.

&gt;Kompany may have his best most consistent season to date, Mangala may continue to improve and Demichellis may show no signs of age. Denayer may prove to be the find of the season. I hope they do, but it's certainly a gamble and no 'given'.

&gt;What is a 'given', that come the end of the season Demichellis will be near 36 and out of contract and Denayer will still be 20.

Thank you for saying that! I thought I was the only one who thought Morrison was quality and should spend his career with Albion and to be honest I can tell there will be a testimonial match soon. :)

&gt; Saido will leave next season if he has another good season.

Yeah, I guess that could happen but on the other hand he could choose to spend his career with us and become a club legend. I guess we have to see how it plays out.

I've watched the reserves and as well as Tyler you should also watch out for Leko - made his debut for U21 vs Tamworth just after turning 15 in the Birmingham Senior Cup Final and personally I think he is a certainly equal to Roberts in terms of talent.

If we very clearly presented the view that we want to spend lots of money and raise taxes, that would not win voters over to us. Certainly, it would not win us the ones we most need.

I agree he'll have to start showing something more soon, else he'll risk just falling away because he never really develops into what you first thought. But for his age, in the PL, he's not bad at all.  

A lot of things he does in the U21's are very good when you see him play, and if he could start delivering them in the first team, he'd be a real asset. It doesn't always happen, and they can't always take the step up, but until he absolutely fails to improve from his first showing, I'll have hope for him.  

As for J-Rod, it's hard to say if he'll come back, or if he'll have been in the world cup squad, but there's absolutely no denying that he was on fire when he got injured.

2. Honestly City will finish at the top of the table. Having already taken points from a top competitor I believe we can maintain course and only strengthen with the potential signings of Otamendi and De Bruyne. Man U still has cohesion issues and the signing of Schweinsteiger is a bit overrated considering he's been injured for the past 2 years. The loss of Di Maria, and Rooney's current form are also concerning. Arsenal are still Arsenal, they switch on in the beginning of games score a couple goals and ease off the throttle, enabling nearly any team to press them for goals. Tottenham are a joke and Liverpool need to improve tactically, Coutinho can't be their leading shot taker (especially with Benteke in the team) and their midfield needs to take control against weaker opposition. 

3. Everton are a team with a fantastic coach and a wealth of talent throughout their starting XI. I expect them to at least make the Europa League places and be a dark horse for top 4, especially if they ward Chelsea off John Stones. Last year Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku had off years, but have looked world beaters into the start of this season. Gaining Deulofeu back from Barca was essential and having him and Mirallas in the starting XI along with Barkley and Lukaku will make Everton a formidable attacking squad. The defense in strong, but I am curious to see how you will cope with the loss of Baines to injury, as he was a huge source of assists from the back last year. 

4. City's best player is and always will be Sergio Ag√ºero, he is by far the best player in the premier league. He takes players on the dribble, has a Messi-like close touch, and a superior shot accuracy from inside and outside the 18. The first half of the Chelsea game could have been 3 or 4 nothing if not for Begovic's amazing saves and lets not forget that hat trick against Bayern away last year. Ag√ºero is our talisman, with the service he will receive from Toure, Silva, Sterling, and possibly de Bruyne I have little doubt he will retain his golden boot. I also believe his injury ridden past is behind him (knock on wood). 

5. I would take either Ross Barkley of Gerard Deulofeu. Both are young promising attackers who have an eye for goal, can take players off the dribble, and can set up their teammates in big game situations. Both are the futures of their respective national teams and I am excited to see Deulofeu's integration in the squad with an inform Barkley alongside him. If you made me pick one though I'd go with Deulofeu. His presence on the wings is more necessary to the current City squad and he would be more willing to cut in and have a go at goal than someone like Jesus Navas. 

6. I feel like every City fan's memorable moment will be the 3-2 title winning goal by Ag√ºero against QPR. Unfortunately for me I had to work that day, but I will never forget asking my friend constantly for scoring updates. He told me City are up 1-0, and I had no doubts they would see the game through. I checked back a little later and he said QPR tied it, QPR are up 2-1 and my expression and work ethic began to change. I had all but assumed City had conceded the title, but later in the day he told me something I could not believe, that we had scored twice in stoppage time and stolen the title back from United. I remember racing home turning on my computer and watching the highlights for the first time. I couldn't help but shed a few passionate tears and rub it in my friends face that his beloved Man U had lost. It was sweeter for me because I had decided to become a fan of whichever team Ag√ºero chose to play for in Summer 2011. When he chose City my friends laughed off their title chances. I will never forget that season and have become a more passionate soccer and City fan ever since.

7. City have a good history against Everton in the past 2 years with 3 wins and a draw. I expect goals and the loss of Baines will hurt your team in the back. As I said before you are an offensively gifted squad, and the game is away so I'd say 3-1 with City the victors. Stones is raw in the starting lineup and I think Yaya Toure and Silva will outmatch Barry and Barkley (though I won't forget his spectacular goal against us last year). If Deulofeu and Mirallas are expected to start I think they will be a few games away from their best, not to mention their cohesion with the squad. Kompany, Fernandinho and our defense are in form and should be able to keep out the threatening Lukaku for most of the match.

null,null,SylvieK,lfc99,,null,"We're just being realistic - the last two performances haven't been convincing, especially last night's. 

There are definitely positives - mainly Clyne being a huge improvement at RB, and Benteke's presence immediately adding both a target and speed to our attack.

It's just that getting to the the point where we're attacking is still a frustrating process. Our build up play, ability to retain/control/recycle possession is still frustratingly disjointed. 

I don't think this is helped by BR's constant switching of player positioning. We can only hope that as time goes by, at the very least Coutinho's role centrally with Benteke in front of him gets more intuitive (there are already signs in this regard).

 That leaves open the question of what the rest of our midfield should look like. Can needs to have a starting role - I feel there's consensus there. Hendo too, obviously (if fit). But what does that mean for Milner, Lallana, Ibe and Firmino?

The fact remains that we are still in the quest for a formation that works. You hope we find that formation soon, because you also hope that shortly after we find a good formation that brings out Benteke's strenghts, we'll have to soon find another one that finds a way to bring out both Sturridge &amp; Benteke's strengths combined. 

 Also, using the excuse of new players bedding in is a bit weak. If anything, our newer players have put in fairly assured performances - Clyne, Milner and Benteke seem to have the firmest knowledge of what is expected of them. Also, other teams have new players they're bedding in too. 

All in all - this isn't negativity compared to what this sub can be like. Just a fairly un-deluded reaction to two matches that have been good in patches, but frustratingly familiar for the most part. 

The key again, tactics &amp; formation. We have better players in all positions than we did last year (bar Sterling). We just need to quickly find a way to get our midfield working well.

Not if you raise minimum wage up a acceptable level. In Germany they don't have that problem. So low pay is not only a migration issue. 

&gt; They don't though, because life is far more cushy here.

Over 300,000 people migrate out every year, Brits make up one of the largest migration groups in Europe. 

&gt; Not a noticeable rise? They've gone up by more than ten fold since joining. There were 7500 Romanians in Britain in 2001, now there are over 100,000. 

Romania didn't join the Free movement until 2013. So all that migration happened over 12 years of points based system. What I am saying is since Romania joined the free movement there has not been a significant change. 

&gt;  What about Poland, how is over half a million anything less than a tidal wave?

Poland has been part of the Free movement for over a decade. Actually Polands migration has done the UK a huge success economically.

""These aspirant voters responded to the Tory messages on a strong economy, low taxes, and sound finances. They abandoned Labour because it lacked economic credibility and gave the perception that it would be profligate in government.""

However, it also states in the article that these are pragmatic voters. It's entirely possible that these people could be swayed by the arguments to invest in infrastructure, fix the housing crisis so their kids can afford somewhere to live. It's not bad economics to invest to grow and we need to make that heard and convince people our way of thinking. I'm not saying that's easy to do, but I think it's a way we can get Labour to win (or at least the Tories to lose).

of course we didnt but it doesnt mean we cant negotiate.


&gt;The benefits you have stated do not effect us which mean we cant use them to say we could always just keep this player, who has never shown an ability to play outside of spain, if you dont match our valuation.

The points i gave are to argue a players market value, not the value to our team.  When a player is more useful to a team he is demanded more. As the demand for him goes up so does his price. Spurs only had one other striker (excluding ade) so one can only make an assumption that we dont want him. 

So the point still being that you can still negotiate to get the best fee you can. Eventhough there is less bargaining power on Spurs' side, it doesnt mean we cant push for a better fee, which we probably did.

Hey!

&gt;I was more thinking of road congestion to be honest. Well documented.

Still, that's going to exist with or without public transport being publicly owned or state owned. It's unrelated.

&gt;As for pricing it should be done on a cost/benefit analysis, taking into account both actual costs, but also external, ie externalities but also social mobility, PPP and the cost of people not travelling. Both economic and social.

So we're to take social mobility into account for the price of a train ticket? Are you having a laugh? The price is determined by how much it costs to run them, plus how much is being invested, plus how much profit there is.

BR had the price set at the cost it took to run them (badly). No profit, no investment, and a lack of real upkeep.

National Rail (or whatever you want to call the whole thing) has it set at the cost to run them (fairly well), plus an extra 35% of *that* cost to improve them so we rapidly get the rail network we actually need, plus a 3% slice of the pie for the millions of shareholders who own the various franchises. The investment that Network Rail is doing is huge!

Do you want something which works, where 3% of the cost goes to shareholders, or do you want something that doesn't work?

Pick any one of those two options :p

There's no need to get so butt hurt over a joke.  Seriously, I get it, you're ridiculously over-sensitive.

&gt;Just because someone said that the punishment the banker received was proportionate doesn't at all mean that they thought that what the woman received was correct.

Which, yet again, I didn't say.  You keep using this tiresome strawman even when I had to meticulously explain to you the basic English which shows you were wrong.

&gt;Just because a comparison is being made doesn't mean that any support of the banker means that there is no support for the woman either.

And I never said that was actually the case, retard!  There are only so many times I can keep explaining that you're using the very fallacy you falsely accused me of, a strawman.

I'm guessing people get very impatient with you, very often.

&gt;It was a misunderstanding on your part rather than an attempt to derail the discussion...But like I said, I now understand it's not because you are trying to put peoples words in peoples mouths but you are simply misunderstanding what people are saying.

This is rich from someone who needs very simple English explained to him in great detail and still fails to understand it.  There's only so much hand holding I'm capable of.

&gt;I never said the woman, or discussion of her is irrelevant.

No you're somehow claiming a highly relevant attempt at bringing a discussion back to the main focus is somehow ""completely irrelevant"".  You most likely used the wrong term, but can't back down and so idiotically keep defending this absurdity.

&gt;I was saying that your assumptions are irrelevant as they are not based on facts.

This is unbelievably idiotic.  So, no one can ever discuss anything unless they magically know exactly what the other person thinks and how they'll respond to every single thing.  You have no idea what the term relevant means.

&gt;I stated this quite clearly before.

And then proceeded to completely ignore my response.

&gt;Seriously mate, the personal insults don't support anything that you're saying, they just show that you're getting unreasonably upset that someone is disagreeing with you on the internet. It's really not that important.

Yes, I admit it, gross stupidity annoys me.  Now, will you stop crying over a joke?

We eat more milk based goods than we produce. However, for obvious reasons, liquid milk is entirely sourced locally. But our dairy farmers don't just sell to the liquid milk sector, but to all dairy sectors. Right now, milk is extremely cheap to import. This is because Russia has banned all European dairy imports (previously, Russia had been a major importer of European cheese). This has meant there is a drastic oversupply of milk in the European markets. As a major importer of dairy, this is good news for us. However, the cheap cost of imports is also dragging down the price of domestic production. Super markets are only one player in thus game... dairy manufacturers (cheese producers, yoghurt makers etc.) have as much, if not more, say in the price of milk than super markets. And if you were a cheese maker, and you could cut input costs while maintaining retail price - why wouldn't you?

Certainly if he doesn't make an impact this season- especially given the players we just brought in- he may need to move on. Our big problem last season, I felt, was our inability to create good chances and, more specifically, to move the ball forward quickly. JWP was not part of the solution. 

Re J-Rod, when I was comparing him to Shearer/Cole, I was engaging in unfair hyperbole- and certainly, if we had another striker last season scoring 15 goals it would have made a huge difference- though if he had been around scoring more goals, likely Pelle would have scored fewer (just the way it works). J-Rod, as I see him, is a 7-10 goals a season striker (if he regains his form, 15 being a one off). He's another- ""works hard, runs all day, sets up chances... (but isn't especially clinical) 'striker'"", even if I wouldn't quite put him the Long category. When he played for England, he showed his limitations- which is why I don't think he would have been picked for the WC. Frankly, he just doesn't excite me and I dont fully understand why other seem to get so excited about him.

I feel confident defensively. We haven't conceded too many goal scoring chances. Practically none down our right hand side which is great, already a massive fan of Clyne. Lovren coming back and performing much better than last year is what I had hope for but he needs to keep it up especially if Sakho is staying (looks likely).

He also doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would consider anything even remotely market-looking as positive. If he sees a problem, the only solution is more state involvement.

Or cutting taxes for small businesses and encouraging cooperatives. These are real things that help the private sector, rather than just the big corporations that drove the 20th century but seem increasingly outdated in the 21st.

&gt;What else... Oh yeah, he wants to leave Nato, which was founded by the Attlee administration.
I'm with you on this, and I'll add unilateral nuclear disarmament. If he's elected leader, I'll fight him on these two points will all the strength I have. That's what having a truly democratic policy process will make possible.

&gt;He would also reverse tuition fees.
Sorry, I am all for this. It may be a roll-back, but it's one that I'm on-board with. Education is a common good, and a universal education service should be at the heart of every modern social democracy.

&gt;On the electoral front he would be more likely to alienate than inspire, and so he'd continue along the Ed Miliband path, only running with it to the ridiculous extreme. Maybe gaining some traction on the personality front but he'd lose most of that on the policy front.

This isn't exactly undoing the work of previous Labour governments, but making our solutions match the problems we currently have. If homelessness and food bank use wasn't a big issue, then tacking left to deal with these issues wouldn't make any sense. Policy has to reflect the state of the country as well as the state of the party.

&gt;But pulling trying to pull a u-turn on a sixth pence just won't work. You can't reverse societies like that and hope it all works out or is even accepted in the first place.

I'm going to catch hell for this, but yes you can. It's been done.  Thatcher did it, and that's the root reason for us needing a Corbyn.

I'm sure some will disagree but I really like the look of Deandre Yedlin from what I've seen and he's quite far down the pecking order at Spurs as they have Walker, just signed Trippier (who I would have loved us to sign) and Dier can play right back too.  He's only recently arrived so they may be unlikely to let him go.. but you never know, possibly worth a loan if nothing else. 

That said it might not be a terrible idea to try out a more defensive-minded right back if Traore's going to be playing often (which we all hope he does I'm sure).  From what I can gather he tends to stick very wide and tends to go down the line a lot more than cut inside.  If that's the case there's not much scope for an attacking fullback to overlap so maybe someone like Hutton (or even Crespo), who's pretty solid defensively, will actually be ok just sitting and releasing Traore to concentrate on attacking.

For the most part, what I'd like to see is a specific style/formation/whatever you want to call it be our primary one and then recruit the best players we can to fit into that strategy.  Instead what we seem to do and have done for years is either pick up random players who show some degree of promise or others who are more established but without a view of how they fit into the side.  This is what has led to 30+ incomings in recent history and a lot of money spent, most of which was largely ineffective.

He didn't want NI to be a special part of the UK, he wanted it to be fully integrated, with the same laws, taxes and everything else apply across the whole United Kingdom. He wanted British rights for British citizens. He also ran on an anti EEC platform, which many farmers, incl those in South Down would have supported.

The Enoch Powell of Northern Ireland had a very different political platform to the Enoch Powell of Great Britain. It's called campaigning to your constituents. Do you think rural Sinn Fein candidates spout the same thing as inner city Dublin SF candidates? If you do, you're incredibly naive.

Yes he was against power sharing but many people were in early 70s Northern Ireland. Kane has said in numerous interviews and platform pieces that the Powell he knew wasn't the Rivers of Blood powell you are condemning him on. 

I am by no means a fan of Powell, I'm not an integrationist nor do I believe that people should not be allowed free passage at borders. I am a fan of Kanes though. I like what he says about the Orange Order, I admire his lack of religious belief, I like what he has to say about the political institutions. He has a very sharp political understanding of Northern Ireland and the UK. 

To condemn him because he worked for a candidate who made a controversial speech is disgraceful. I do not judge those who work for Gerry Kelly even though Gerry shot a prison guard in the head and used to use gut wrenching phrases like ""Legitimate target"" and sickening excuses like ""It was an attack on the uniform not the individual.""

Or he'll have to borrow. Or he'll have to make cuts. That's how it typically works out with these things. 

In either event his tax rises in the current climate basically just amount to a different form of austerity. Corporate austerity, shall we say. This will still affect workers and consumers because they will pass it on to us in the form of prices or lower wages.  

But you're right that the big companies are having to adapt. This has been a long time in development. It doesn't make them outdated though, anymore than we could make that argument about nation states. 

&gt; This isn't exactly undoing the work of previous Labour governments, but making our solutions match the problems we currently have. If homelessness and food bank use wasn't a big issue, then tacking left to deal with these issues wouldn't make any sense.

You aren't really arguing anything here, you're just stating a slogan. I could just as pithily say, no, he isn't making our solutions match the problems we currently have. You then simply assume that tacking further left is the only way to deal with those issues. And particularly tacking left in a particular way. It's not really that simple. 

And even if we accept the premise that Thatcher did pull a 'u-turn,' which I think is doubtful, the only way she managed was because of the context in which she was operating. Corbyn, unlike Syriza or Podemos, doesn't have that luxury, much as his proponents will try to push that envelope. Absent a second financial crash or some lefty equivalent of the Winter of Discontent he simply won't have the political trade winds at his back. 

What's more is that her radicalism made her deeply unpopular. However, she wasn't unpopular/divisive before the fact, as Corbyn. So we're back at electability arguments, I guess. 

&gt; democratically chosen policies he is tied to the will of the party, not the will of the man

This is also basically just a slogan. It doesn't really mean much. When you think about it there is a fine line between a leader's influence and how his followers vote and act. It's as superficial as the claims pretending this isn't about personality, when in reality his character is a big factor in the success of his political message among certain groups. 

His main problem is that inherent to all forms of [populism](https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/crist%C3%B3bal-rovira-kaltwasser/populism-its-opposites-and-its-contentious-relationsh), whether on the left like Corbyn/Sanders or on the right like Farage/Trump. He divides society into two homogeneous groups: the people and the elite. This colours his and his supporters entire conception of democracy to produce a rather narrow definition of it. 

Really these two groups aren't homogeneous and needn't' be diametrically opposed either. An effective and constructive politics is one, in my view, that seeks to bridge this alleged gap rather than exasperate it. Though that balance isn't easy to find or at all intuitive, especially if you are coming from a populist rather than pluralist conception of democracy.

1) Howard; Coleman, jags, stones, Oviedo; McCarthy, Barry cleverly; Barkley, kone, lukaku. 

2) I think we'll be comfortably top half, possibly pushing for a Europa League position (yikes)

3) I think city will be top 3. You lot, arsenal, and Chelsea will be tough to separate. 

4) Lukaku is our best player in my opinion. Utterly irreplaceable and virtually unplayable on his day. 

5) I'd take david silva in a heartbeat. Someone with his vision and technical ability would be immense for us. 

6) I've been supporting Everton my whole life, but I was only 3 when we last won silverware. My favorite moment in recent memory is a tie between our 4-0 over Wolfsburg in the Europa league and Jags' thundercunt against the shite.

Pompey Player provides only one real value: listening to matches live by streaming radio. There's not much beyond that. I believe the whole interface is built by [The Football League](http://www.football-league.co.uk/), and it's definitely no frills. Live statistics and text updates *might* work, but usually it doesn't, and they're horribly basic anyway.

If you want to listen on your phone, you have to download the FLi Player app. Once again, no frills. Just online streaming of the games.

First, not every single young player we have will make it. We buy them with the potential of being a world class player. The thing is 90% or more won't develop as well as their scouting report expected. And then we try to offload them to generate money. Fans need to learn this.

Second, they don't have the ability to play how we want them too. We could maybe play them in the Capital one Cup. The rest of the time they will sit on the bench. Regardless who we play in the PL we have to field our best available team. Every point matters. The race will be way to close for us to experiment with youth players that aren't up to par yet.

Yep, it certainly is. It can cause major problems when it pollutes lakes/rivers etc.

&gt;It is not often recognised that milk can have a significant polluting effect on water if allowed to reach
rivers or streams. It can be as much as 400 times more polluting than untreated domestic sewage.
Naturally occurring bacteria break down milk entering a watercourse, using up oxygen in the water
more quickly than it can be replaced. As a result of falling oxygen levels, fish and other creatures can
suffocate. The high fat content of milk and its products can also cause physical problems within
drainage systems. Solidified fat can cause blockages, resulting in overflows from the system and
possible pollution of watercourses

Taken from [the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency website.](http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/ppg17.pdf)

Having said that, it shouldn't be an issue if it is poured into the foul sewage system in environmental terms. Not sure the local water company would be happy though, most dairies need trade effluent agreements (perhaps Tesco has these?) and the pouring of milk has to be controlled to ensure that the sewage system can actually cope with it, not only in terms of cleaning up the mess but making sure that the milk and it's fatty content doesn't clog up the drainage system. 

Still seems like a mental way to get rid of milk. Surely just giving it away in the shop would be a better bloody idea than throwing it.

I hear a lot of what you're saying, and  rebalancing an economy in favour of smaller businesses is easier said than done, but I don't think that it's a lost cause - and just because it's difficult doesn't mean it shouldn't be attempted.

And to be less slogan-led about it: Small businesses count for about 50% of private sector turnover, and 60% of private sector employment. Any effort that can be made to re-introduce the recently abolished small-profits rate and increase the burden on corporations to at least match that placed on small businesses (don't believe that it's a contested point as to whether the small business sector pays more tax than the corporate sector) should be. Because it's the right thing to do.

But that still leaves the *how*. I don't believe anyone's really tried to make corporations pay their due at any point in the last 30 years, I believe successive governments have indulged big business. I don't believe it is actually as impossible to make corporations pay as some seem to think, it just takes what's been lacking; the political will.

null,null,ffsshhgrgl,null,null,null,"The TL;DR of it is that I feel the occasional focus on their backstory was preferable and they seemed more eager to participate in things (although I can admit that hindsight might play a bit into it.) I compared Clara to Amy because she was more recent and I could offer a more objective comparison right away for you.

To address your question: If I had to post my own unpopular choice is that I really miss the zaniness of RTD's up-and-down tug of war with how you felt from episode to episode. There were silly one-shot adventures and then gut-wrenching choices the characters had to make, and the theme of sequential episodes often varied wildly (with the exception of deliberate two-parters, naturally). Say what you will about individual alien races, you got fun space/time romps grouped tightly with the seriousness/darkness of the overall season's direction. The companions being featured and then taking a support role back and forth worked in a way that kept you in a cycle of wanting to see what's up next for them and how they could contribute best.

The Clara Adventures seem more thematically in-line with each other as you watch them in sequence, which is good in a show sometimes when it's something like Sherlock. There you can have a whole ""season"" that feels like one extended episode. I love Sherlock. Unfortunately the premise of Doctor Who episodes all seem very Clara-centric lately so it ends up feeling a bit bland in comparison for people missing the exploration and playful aspects of previous glimpses into their world.

We need breaks from just one person's story line, and it doesn't really seem like Clara and The Doctor get along very well anymore anyway. Even when some of the other companions and The Doctor disagreed, they didn't reject sharing how they felt with him. It seems like a bad relationship at this point, where they're still in each other's spheres because they don't know how else to be right now. It's less fun to watch when you're uncomfortable with how they treat each other. The Doctor almost seems surprised when Clara agrees with him sometimes. Donna, an easy fan favorite for contrast, vehemently disagreed with The Doctor sometimes but was always open with how he could stop being an insensitive alien dingus about things. It was cute when they disagreed. It was playful, and in the end she always wanted to be there more than any place else in the universe despite it all. Clara ends up feeling betrayed more often than not and it's not very watchable because it's harder to relate to. It feels sometimes like she isn't having a good time unless she's currently demonstrating a skill she has somehow mastered off camera (I know, time-fragment Clara. I know.)

That's why I have Listen saved on my DVR and refuse to delete it. They managed to remain very Clara-centric while still adding a great deal to the universe by exploring other people's story and experiences for a bit. It's still Clara's lens, but she was more along for the adventure than it feels like she's been for a while. She tries to help in a clever way in the end, and doesn't end the episode feeling put out about it.

As an additional side note, at this stage it feels like those TV competition shows where someone says backstage that they want to quit. They should be the next to be eliminated, because they're taking a spot from others who want to be there and would be happier in that role.",null,0,null,1439928251,null,null,1439929843,0,cu7fdrp,null,t3_3hd6j2,null,null,null,t1_cu7c5ri,null,null,null,1441328499,null,2,null,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

null,null,ScousePie,null,null,null,"Not to aim any criticism at you OP but this article is bullshit. There is so much wrong with this article that, after a day of explaining the club's position on Stones in r/Soccer, I am angry enough to explain why.

First of all, I hate these websites because they're marketing the premier league and targeting clicks from top 4 casuals. I think all of the Americans who have found the calling to Everton are great lads and have shown an appreciation for the game that goes beyond settling for the more televised and heavily marketed Champions League teams. The media in America really sells the CL teams to American fans and it is easy for those with a casual interest to pick up supporting a team because they are accessible. However, the media in general is worse than Sky for bigging up the top 4 and they don't know or report much teams outside of that.

This article is written by somebody with a spin to sell and who hasn't done their homework. He starts off by personifying the fans behind the protest movements as angsty teenagers and compares us to kopites (which as far as the plane goes is fair, but still not on). He then sets up and knocks down his very literal interpretation of NSNO, how dare little Everton expect the best. NSNO is a philosophy of continuous improvement, it is based on trying to achieve the impossible ideal of perfection. The key word is trying, it's about the journey and never being satisfied with stagnation because we can do better.

He further tries to imply that NSNO means we expect us to sign Messi and Ronaldo, ladies and gentlemen this author is a tit. At this point he is using hyperbole to dance around the fact that this article has no substance and is just uneducated conjecture (read jarg horseshite).

Then he pulls out a statistics table that shows we've had an average of about 7th place finishes during the last ten seasons in the prem. He doesn't pull out any figures on net spend, but then splashes around the recent acquisitions of Lukaku and McCarthy as big figures to suit his case (ignoring the sale of Felliani which is facilitated both) and then even throws the acquisitions of Mirallas, Oviedo, and Pienaar (After how many seasons of no permanent incoming transfers and selling Arteta) for 12.7 million out as examples of further big business.

Then we finish with the fact that Tottenham are in a better financial position but they're in London so let's just accept Kenwright can't beat that.

&gt;That‚Äôs not as much transfer activity as Spurs, who‚Äôve used the draw of London, the club‚Äôs commercial power, and the benefits of White Hart Lane to edge ahead of Everton, but to ask Kenwright and his board to overcome all those obstacles is to ask for something remarkable. And to ask for only the best, as if Everton will ever reasonably compete with Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United in that regard, is to buy into a fantasy more cliched than Saturday‚Äôs crop duster. Only a set of fans short-sighted enough to ignore the 72-point season finished 15 months ago would ever come of that conclusion.

""Give up now and accept your mediocrity. ""

Oh and if you can't ignore or accept the fact that Kenwright and the board have put nothing into the club for years then you must be unreasonable and insane.

&gt;Most fans are reasonable people, but it‚Äôs the lunatic fringe that‚Äôs earned the group the fanatics‚Äô label. With that in mind, asking fans to be reasonable is as naive as thinking a crop duster will change the world. But in this case, Everton‚Äôs fringe is being particularly unreasonable, more unreasonable than when they booed their team a year ago.


This article completely ignores the fact that the board have put nothing into the club, sold off our assets, have continuously failed moves from Goodison Park, and had to sell players to fund a bank overdraft being cut short. Nothing about the net spend during the last ten years.

I don't think they ever got out of second gear.

null,null,ex-turpi-causa,null,null,null,"The problem with doing this through the tax system is that it is so immensely complicated. That's how you get loopholes. How will they draw these lines? What they really need is some sort of international body to audit and collect taxes, but this is just as fanciful as thinking you can hike the rates and simple bring in more revenue. You can hike the rate all you want on the larger guys but they will just restructure. Behaviour doesn't stay static when you mess with something like tax. 

There are also plenty of [studies](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11151-011-9278-8) that show that large corporations don't really have that much of an advantage of over smaller companies. Perhaps we should simply [tax them all less,](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/opinion/abolish-the-corporate-income-tax.html) and we can collect more that way. But there are trade-offs to every approach. 

I'm surprised to hear you say no one has really tried over the last 30 years. These arguments are fundamentally the same as they have been [for centuries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejJRhn53X2M); this is how we have a pretty good idea of how the rich (e.g.) will behave when you try to tax them at 50%+. Thing is that now it's even worse because capital is even more mobile than before. This [isn't strictly the fault of any one government](https://ideas.repec.org/p/rut/rutres/200213.html) or ideology -- it's just where we are on account of globalisation and the rate of technological change. Which is what makes Corbyn's proposals all the more futile - it's an attempt to apply a traditional statist approach to a world that is far more complex and continues changing rapidly. 

My issue with Corbyn is that most of it is rhetoric over pragmatism. So you get all this chat about ""[corporate welfare](http://waitingfortax.com/2015/07/28/the-truth-about-the-truth-about-corporate-welfare/)"" and how we need to help small businesses with the state instead -- it's all rather incoherent. Same with the whole environmentalism and opening the coal mines. 

I think you may have misunderstood my point at the end on populism and homogeneous groups, so I apologise for being unclear -- I didn't mean to suggest his campaign was homogeneous but was talking about the conceptual approach to the sort of philosophy of the movement.

Looking at the system, it's hugely complex and difficult to implement changes due to its operational model, ageing assets, unions.

It will take a lot to turn the ship around.

People's gripes with the railways are: too expensive, regularly run late and have a poor customer experience. That's all three sides of the triangle!

Making it easier to claim for late fares is a great start.

In terms of cost, look around at the inefficiency at stations: lots of manned 'gates' rather than automatic barriers, no top up cards for fares (it costs less in card transactions), they use paper tickets, lots of empty ad space.., that's only the things I've noticed at my small, local station.

There are a lot of changes which can be made.

&gt;
&gt;__Reason for Becoming a Doctor__: Currently unknown, although Dr. Hadley originally felt that not knowing whether she had Huntington's empowered her to take challenges and risks like competing for a position under House. House blurts out her reason is to make her life matter before it's over. Thirteen later confirms this.
&gt;__Medical Specialty__: Internal Medicine
&gt;__Personality type__: Mysterious, self-contained. Thirteen often sees past a lot of the stereotypes that the other doctors have of people. For example, she treats drug addicts the same as she would a patient without a drug addiction. This is perhaps because of her experimental drug use in the past.

Because the very real, and very sad, fact is that in this country, in 2015, people are targeted for hatred and violence simply because they happen to be of a certain religion. The rise in attacks on Muslim women in particular is massive, often targeted for their headscarves or their clothing. In this case, 'innocent until proven guilty' doesn't even get a look in- they're guilty simply by being Muslim. Sweeping this under the rug or saying stupid shit like 'well Islam is becoming a real problem' doesn't serve anyone any purpose, much less British citizens who, in a country where they're promised religious freedom, are then subject to violence. 

Now I can understand that some people may not like Islam, or that they may feel legitimate concern over extremism. However their personal feelings do not permit them to then subject others, and particularly those of the group they dislike, to their opinions by force. Neither does it give them the right to say any old shit they feel like. 

As to race not being discussed, I doubt anyone would have a problem with such discussion if it wasn't dominated by idiotic, knuckle-dragging Stormfront types and people as are found in the EDL and other far-right groups.

I would settle for actually taxing corporations at an effective rate of 20%.

&gt;I'm surprised to hear you say no one has really tried over the last 30 years.

I'm basing this on the fact that corporate tax intake as a share of GDP has fallen an awful lot in the UK, but the same is not true worldwide. So even if we're trying - we're not trying as hard as others. 

EDIT: I take this one back - I was working with bad stats - we appear to be roughly tied to the OCED average at the moment.

&gt;My issue with Corbyn is that most of it is rhetoric over pragmatism.

Now's the time for rhetoric, surely. We've got a long time left in this parliament to define detailed policy, but I don't see what's wrong with a bold statement of intent. 

&gt;Same with the whole environmentalism and opening the coal mines.

I think he's been wilfully misunderstood here, which possibly shows naivety on his part but not incoherence.

&gt;I didn't mean to suggest his campaign was homogeneous but was talking about the conceptual approach to the sort of philosophy of the movement.

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; Well, the idea of equal rights isn't really to go toe-to-toe with a bin lorry - it's to not be put it any position, regardless of how well you protect yourself, where you might be squashed. 

True enough, but most cyclists - if asked - could not tell you where the blind spots on an HGV are.

In the absence of that knowledge, right-of-way or not, they should just keep the hell away because they don't know whether the driver can be reasonably expected to see them. For instance, if a lorry is waiting at the lights to turn left and you go down the left hand sde, you haven't been put in a position where you might be squashed. You *put yourself* in that position. *You* cycled down the left hand side of that truck.

There is an element of personal responsibility here. Just like any cyclist who takes themselves onto a motorway takes their life into their own hands, because they *shouldn't be there*.

When there was that bad spell in London in 2013 back with 6 cyclists killed in a fortnight, 5/6 were hit by long vehicles (lorries/coaches/buses).

You filter down the left hand side when the truck turns left and you're dead. End of discussion. So don't. Yes, road users need to give cyclists space. But cyclists also need to give large, unwieldy and less maneuverable vehicles space - the same as small boats give big ships lots of space, and Cessnas don't play with 747s.

Same as any cyclist who takes to the road with earphones in and their hood up. By wilfully cutting out all peripheral vision and their sense of hearing, they've signed a waiver that states ""I am [suicidal/an utter fucking moron](delete as applicable)"" and basically waived their right to live. Tinted windows in cars have legal limits as to how dark they can be - precisely to ensure the driver can see the road around them, and I am legally obliged to have wing mirrors and/or a rear-view mirror. For cyclists to wilfully risk their life like that should basically indemnify any other road user who is involved in an accident with them. I might as well paint my car mirrors and windows black.",null,0,null,1439930866,null,null,1439972660,0,cu7h6d8,null,t3_3hg54m,null,null,null,t1_cu78l6g,null,null,null,1441329346,null,1,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

2. We don't NEED one, but I'd feel more secure if we had a backup striker of Gomis' quality. Although, if Gomis is hurt we could put Ayew up front without losing too much quality on the wings.

3. We want to be in the top ten at least. Looking at the other clubs, only the established European clubs seem to have an obvious advantage, and even then it's not unrealistic for us to take a point or three from Tottenham, Everton, or Liverpool on our day.

In BT's case, they literally seem to flip a coin. I live in Cornwall like HawkUK and it is impressive how random it is.

e.g. half the street has FTTP, the other half FTTC - both have overhead wiring, I can't see a big reason not to go FTTP. Or a random couple of poles get FTTP whereas the rest are copper only. Or, like in my village, people like me get FTTC but down the road it is FTTP (both overhead wiring again, not exchange only lines).

BT additionally chooses FTTP in some cases for the very very rural areas, where there are only a handful of houses per 10 miles. I'm sure the ROI on that will be brilliant.

And while it will cost more initially to do FTTP, the point is that you can save money by abandoning copper (fibre is less likely to go wrong and is not as affected by weather, and is immune to RF interference), and eventually, selling off a ton of the exchange buildings you don't need. The savings come a bit later, which doesn't obviously sell well to management who are concerned about profits now

You've been downvoted for ""explaining what a free market is"" totally wrongly, because you have no idea what a free market is.

All those employment and health and safety laws make it not a free market, too.

null,null,TheNinjaFish,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; Typically calling someone an 'MRA' is perfectly acceptable...use 'SJW' and you're a conspiracy theorist woman hating neckbeard who is reacting to imaginary problems?

On your first point, MRA (Men's Rights Activism) is an actual political movement, calling someone a Men's Rights Activist is a legitimate title. SJW (Social Justice Warrior) is just a derogatory term for a feminist. Using the term SJW non-ironically just puts you out as an anti-feminist, on of the /r/TumblrInAction crowd who just makes fun of the feminist movement.

On your other points, MRAs usually seek out anything they can to disprove feminism, to claim that men are actually the oppressed sex, and in doing so they (usually) make a massive deal out of insignificant issues. Sure, they may be issues, and we should talk about them, but MRAs blow them way out of proportion and talk about them so much that even mentioning these issues gives off a creepy, MRA vibe.

Take 'men being guilty until proven innocent in rape cases'. By this I assume you are talking about false rape cases, where a man is punished because someone lied and said that he raped her. Yes, this is an issue, but compare it to the thousands of unreported rapes, where the rapist is never caught and punished, and the handful of false rape claims every year becomes less significant.

**Edit:** I want to add that these are issues that are actually dealt with by feminism, under the context of removing toxic gender roles and destroying the patriarchy. But MRAs usually ignore this and call all feminists misandristic SJW.

**Double Edit:** I just realised my ""SJW"" to ""Skeleton"" chrome extension just made this comment look ridiculous. I'm fixing it now.",null,1,null,1439932641,null,null,1439941196,0,cu7id0h,null,t3_3hg7g3,null,null,null,t1_cu7ex4b,null,null,null,1441329904,null,4,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Burnham/Cooper - Labour minority government, relying on the Lib Dems (on 20-30 seats) and the SNP (on 40-50 seats) to pass legislation. Lost seats to UKIP in the North of England and South Wales, almost cancelling the gains made in other parts of the country in 2020, their successor wins over enough UKIPers to regain the lost Northern seats. Modest recovery in Scotland.

Corbyn - modest gains in seat terms in 2020, mostly in Scotland and London, hiding a more significant rise in vote share. Replaced by a more centrist leader, who leads Labour to a tiny majority in 2025, perhaps single figure seat margin. Successor's victory based upon the solidifying of Labour's seats and partial resurrection of the parties Scottish fortunes  achieved by Corbyn. 

Best case scenario - Corbyn leads party until 2017/18, replaced by younger, slightly less left wing (but still left of Cooper/Burnham now) leader who takes advantage of the willingness of the previous leader to change the terms of the debate. New leader faces a Conservative party led by George Osborne which has lost it's majority to by-elections (I expect the Lib Dems to regain some seats in the South West) and becomes largest party.

By the rules of the game, it should have been 0-0. Elphick had his hands on Lovren. Was it soft? Yes. But it was still a foul nonetheless.

There were many positives and many negatives from the game:

* Rodgers showed good in-game management to park the bus, as we were struggling to keep the ball after Henderson went off and Bournemouth were pressing us high

* In the first half, our attacking and our movement was very fluid and after we scored the goal we had them pinned back in their half because of Coutinho, Benteke, and Lallana's movement

* Benteke is a monster in the air, and is a great outlet when teams are pressing us high

* We looked lost after Henderson went off, and we lost a link between defence and attack as Can and Milner were fairly quiet

* Our left side is very vulnerable, and many of Lovren's frailties are being masked because Gomez rarely gets caught out of position

* Matt Ritchie should never get that many attempts on goal

Once you're on cs3, that's a segregated lane, so would probably meet most people's definition of safe. It does have the junction right of way problem that all segregated lanes have, so just be aware of cars turning into side roads. It's a well cycled route at rush hours though, so there shouldn't be many problems.

The rest is how you get to cs3. The main roads (commercial street, commercial road, Whitechapel high st, canon/valance street) can be a bit packed with unpleasant vehicles that take a bit of confidence to navigate. On the other hand, the residential roads around there are fairly quiet, so it might be worth taking a slightly contorted route if you're not feeling confident.

Oh, and reccy the route beforehand on a weekend. Cs3 had some weird bits that you don't want to catch you out when it's busy.  (Also, a key rule is to take it easy: i find London cyclists a bit pushy, but there's no point competing cos the pace is ultimately set by the traffic lights, everything else is just sprinting for the fun of it)

The important points are

* Not doing something your work coach tells you to do will get you sanctioned
* If it's not your first time in the last year then the minimum time goes up to 2 weeks (then 4 weeks)
* You'll still lose money for those two weeks even if you complete the task in the meantime

Cameron wouldn't change his style at all with anyone but Corbyn. Hilary Benn showed how to do it, stop trying to make it a panto and talk seriously about the issues and the issues alone. Only Corbyn has done this in the campaign nevermind at the dispatch box. There's a few more cons you can add to that list:

* Thinks simply being a woman is more radical than having mapped out an entire plan for the future of the UK's economy.

* Never answers a straight question

* Is happy to attack fellow Labour MPs if it means getting ahead.

* Was part of the last New Labour government who are totally untrusted on the economy by the electorate

And just to make it fair I'll throw in a few pros for you:

* She's actually been on benefits

* Will defend Labour's previous record from lies. I didn't particularly like New Labour, but the Tories have lied to the public about the crash and have got away with it, Burnham and Kendall are happy to continue this lie.

Honestly she had my 2nd preference for a while, but her attacks on Corbyn shows she couldn't unite the party at grassroots level. She's said she wouldn't serve in his potential cabinet, or have him serve in his.
