FSG are the ones who decided to go for a manager still in development after sacking Kenny. They're also the ones who then put in place a transfer committee still in development for the manager to work under. While we can only properly judge this window's business at the end of the season, this *looks* like the most successfully executed summer window since Rodgers has joined - and that's at the fourth attempt.

Andrew Waugh, founder and director of Waugh Thistleton Architects, said he would not have touched the project “with a bargepole” if he had known his designs were going to be used to house displays of Ripper artefacts, including a recreation of one of the 1888 crime scenes.
“It is salacious, misogynist rubbish,” Waugh told Building Design online. “The local community was duped, we were duped.

To give a few examples..

In favour, the government did run East Coast for a few years and from what I understand it has glowing reports. It even made a good profit. However running some services on a specifically upgraded line is different from running northern services with clapped out stock.

In favour, we could run the railways not for profit. This wouldn't necessarily mean a fare reduction but may mean we can start spending money on new stock and upgrades.

In favour, HOPEFULLY, the ticketing system might stop being so stupidly complicated that even experienced seasoned travellers like me struggle to understand what's on offer.

In favour, HOPEFULLY, when there's a train late they wouldn't spend a crazy amount of time and wages trying to figure out if it was the fault of Network Rail or the TOC.

In favour TOC sniping will stop (e.g. Virgin and Shrewsbury) and services might be simplified so you don't have 3 companies running the same bits of line. This might free up some stock.

Against, the government does run Network Rail which is hit and miss with it's spending and targets. Crossrail = good. Birmingham New Street redevelopment = not good.

Against, apart from franchise agreements, private companies can run the railways with little or no government interference, meaning that theorietically they'll do best for their lines and stations rather than some political shite.

Overall I don't think national owned railways will magically make all trains run on time and lower fares. All the existing problems will still be there because many are caused by stock and infrastructure, not by TOC incompetence or desire for profit.",null,0,null,1439000698,null,null,false,0,ctvj9vt,null,t3_3fuwx9,null,null,null,t3_3fuwx9,null,null,null,1440351106,null,2,null,uktrains,t5_2z9xu,2,null

He loves our youth (or has been mandated to do so), sure, but our best young performers last season were Bentaleb and Kane, who he didn't exactly discover.  He benefited from Sherwood's bravery, and then with Kane simply got forced to use him because our other two options were rubbish.

I don't feel in one whole season he displayed enough tactical nous to get the best out of our squad as a whole.  I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt for this season, but if we are going to spend less and still remain in and around the UCL/Europa conversation (which I think is a must even if actually achieving 4th is probably unrealistic these days), then we need to play a lot better football and get more out of our squad.

But the way I think of it is - and it's probably a bit old-fashioned - you only sack the incumbent manager if they've run out of ideas. And Rodgers hasn't run out of ideas. We had problems in each area of the pitch last season, but 2 of them had easy fixes. In attack, the problem was strikers not offering movement - solved. In midfield, the problem was Gerrard making things imbalanced - solved. In defence...not solved.

The previous season he scored 12 in 13 for Milan, so he's definitely a functional striker, and he has been under every manager he's played under except Rodgers.

  Certainly, Baloteli is erratic and unpredictable, and you never really know how much of him will turn up for the game, but he's *much* better than his performances for Liverpool would suggest, and his numbers back that up. 

  He's a massively frustrating player because he has never been as good as he should be, but he's still better than most in his position, if less reliable. I'm sure the reasons for his lackluster performances last season are complex, but when an established name plays significantly below his normal standard for an entire season, then one has to ask questions of the manager.

There was also Ian and Ben but they had romance-like relationships with their respective female companions as well as Harry, but he was often treated like Mickey/Rory/Danny by the Doctor. 

If Donna was one of your favorite companions then definitely check out what survives of the Second Doctor and Jamie's run. They were the bestest of best friends and even though there were female companions, Jamie pretty much was the primary companion. Some examples of their relationship: [assorted clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COFcyo8Qf1c), [The Doctor quieting Jamie up about the TARDIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpvIqrM8b3g), [Jamie and the Doctor get trapped in an alley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSjkbzcXe9Y), [Jamie and the Doctor mistakenly grab each other's hands thinking Victoria was between them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD926WSh5w8), [Jamie and the Doctor are frantic and clingy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRQrqCZjziM).

Turlough was probably one of the more interesting male companions even if not always one of the more well handled.

I support my local team (Chicago Fire) on a regular basis. I watch games on tv and I go to see games when time allows. The problem is (at least in Chicago) there hasn't been anything to get excited about in years. Our last marquee player was Mexican international Blanco and maybe Brian McBride. Our best year was our inaugural season when we won the league. Recently we've struggled to get more wins than draws (I believe we have the MLS record for most draws in a season) and every time an exciting player moves to MLS either we go unmentioned or in the case of Jermaine Jones we lost out on a weird ruling by the league. Because of all this the club struggled to bring in good attendances and the atmosphere at games has died. 


I started really watching and getting into football after seeing a couple Fire games and started watching the Prem and fell in love with Spurs. I support both teams and always will but right now Spurs are at the forefront because of how the Fire have really stagnanted.

null,null,Timothy_Claypole,null,null,null,"The OU, as a distance learning institution, provides a series of text books to go with each course. No lectures of course, but there are tutorials every one or two months with a tutor from your region. Assignments happen roughly once a month or every two months. These are either posted or submitted online.

Whereas in a ""normal"" uni you attend lectures and take notes, all the notes are taken for you, you just have to learn. If study is outside of a job or parenting it can be difficult. It requires you to be both good at time management and good at concentrating. 

There are online forums to talk to other students and online tutorials but it isn't quite the same as being at a ""normal"" uni, of course, and in many ways you cannot be carried by anyone. You would miss those lightbulb moments from a quick chat. Equally you force an independence of thinking, and tutors tend to be helpful.

In some cases OU modules (at any level) start from a lower point than normal uni courses as they may have people just coming into study but introductions are brief and the material is certainly what you would term ""degree standard"". It isn't Oxbridge, as there isn't the same depth of material, but equally it shouldn't be underestimated. 

The range of people doing OU courses is huge. You get people with degrees from prestigious unis doing second degrees, people coming into university study for the first time, retired people and young people who don't want to go to a bricks and mortar uni. They tend not to be the types who go to uni for the sake of it.

Getting a distinction in many modules requires 85% in coursework AND exam. You are awarded the lower of either score as an overall grade, so no slipping up.

null,null,hktouk,cnty-expat,S. Asia,null,"&gt; The dictionary definition of an expatriate is ""someone who lives outside their native country""

yes, completely agree with you on this, just that having lived and worked overseas, there is a framing in the UK debate that ignores the fact that we require an influx of skilled expatriate workers to make up for skills gaps that started occurring with the loss of industry and a shift towards service industries in the UK.

With the poorly managed immigration controls that have been in place over several years, there has been a lot of advantage taken of unskilled labor to counter the increased cost and burden of employing British labour in addition to high demand-low supply industries such as the medical field. 

This does lead to increased numbers of people claiming unemployment benefit (dependents of the workers, laid off workers due to decreased job security). this number is not evidence that immigration must be completely stopped but again, its just not a completely useful number in a vacuum. 

we need to look at statistically controlling which sectors require immigration, which industries have laborer shortages and why we are failing as a nation to produce people skilled as we need.

furthermore, we need as a country to change the economic environment that allows for business practices that take advantage of cheaper labour.

i don't have a solution but living as an expat the debate that I see from outside of the UK is so partisan and it seems like the conversation is controlled by right-elements like UKIP which take advantage of the mix of apathy and ignorance present in the UK which drowns out decent conversation about constructive reform. 

my first post was more a reaction to the imbalance between our ability to sensibly control immigration and what we actually do on these issues. i don't have a real solution (other than something like Australia's point system) i just get a bit down about the level of discourse back home.

I agree with you that in this debate it's often understated how powerful modern cannabis strains really are, and how cannabis abuse can have severe consequences on a person and their environment. But do these potential negative effects mean there is no way to use hallucinogenics responsibly, and with positive effects?

I think alcohol is a great analogy. Especially in the UK there is a massive abuse problem. But I think the problem is with the attitude of the people, not the drug. Many seem to drink to get as drunk as possible as quickly as possible. You will run into problems if this is your approach, no matter which drug you use.

There is no doubt that cannabis consumption can be detrimental to your health. Should I tell people they can't go mountain biking because they might break their leg? You said yourself their would be additional tax revenue - wouldn't that offset at least some of the increased treatment costs? 

Right now people are criminals simply because they are smoking a spliff. We don't need to jump to the other extreme and ""encourage its use"".

Now for the good upper tier referees (or rather the ones having a good game) this rule could be useful. I understand the intent. 

But I think that more often than not these decisions will get just talked to death on air. Talking excessively about calls is one of my pet peeves, takes you out of the action and flow of the game I feel. Like Dr. Fucking Joe for the WWC every little call was ""this is the rule he was right/wrong blah blah blah"" was so bothersome. Just shut up I'm watching the game! 

The emphasis on every inch of the game needs to be perfect as dictated by the officials at the speed the game is played on top of the gamesmanship of top professionals is ABSURD. Mistakes will be made, always. Until we develop robot referees. 

split second decision have to happen and sometimes they're going to be wrong and fuck you or your opponent over. It's part of the game. The lack of some fans to move on or blame a 90 minute game on one call is one of my least favorite aspects of some fans of this certain part of the sport. 

It reeks of fans who've not played enough to understand the nature of the beast that is refereeing. If a striker misses 9/10 shots but scores on one he's a hero. A referee makes 19/20 calls right and all that's talked about is the one possible mistake. It's just an uninteresting narrative. It's just taking up too much of the broadcast.

null,null,asherah213,null,null,null,"Farmers specialise, it's no longer the 50's/60's, I can't think of any dairy farmer who also farms beef. You need different breeds for starters, different farm set ups/equipment, different nutrients in the grass. It's just not done. 

The current statistics say three Dairy farmers per week are going out of business. The farmers are a stubborn bunch (trust me, I know!), they eek it out for as long as they can, and have a lot of pride. The suicide rate among farmers is three times higher than in the rest of the population.  

The issue with dairy is that you have lots of little dairy farmers, and only about 3 companies which you can sell your milk to. So these companies have a huge amount of power in the market and can pay however little they like, farmers don't own bottling plants or shops.  They will either keep doing this until only the most efficient factory-like farms are left which will balance the power in the market, or the farmers get together and put and end to the pressure. There used to be the Milk Marketing Board in the UK which was set up to ensure a fair minimum price for both farmers and buyers, but that disappeared back in 1994, which has led to the supermarkets reducing prices year on year until we get to the point we are now. 

And as to farmers not losing money, it is the only sector of the UK economy to have rising debt levels despite the economic recovery. Farmers do have assets in land and equipment, but they are cash-poor which leads to a lot of debt. Add in the pride that no one likes to appear like they've got a failing business, and debt just climbs and climbs. 

* In related data, figures from the Bank of England showed that in May 2014, the UK agricultural sector was the only business area to see rises in outstanding debt over each of the last three years. Most other business sectors saw successive reductions in debt levels

As to seeing a set of accounts making a loss, Google your local dairy farm and go on Companies House website, you can pull their accounts from there for £1 (2 pints of milk!) and see for yourself.  I've put the link for you below.

Our last trophy was in 2008-09 when we won the league cup (least prestigious of major trophies but still important) and we have a history of playing attacking and exciting football. 

We're a good club that's never really in relegation danger but is just scratching the surface of being a top club. we're currently constructing a new stadium so money will be tight in the coming years, hence our reliance on young academy talent (we have one of the best youth academies in Europe)

People here like to say supporting spurs is heart attack inducing because we're sorta unpredictable (though i think that's a part of every team honestly) but is true a bit. last year we had huge derby wins against arsenal and chelsea (I'd watch the highlights somewhere) but dropped a decent amount of points to lower oppposition.

Nope. I suspect the dissenting Labour MP's will be purged or de-selected. Long time coming. Something like that needs to be done to change the party from being a vehicle for careerist spads and chancers to being something worthy of the name Labour

From what I've seen the whole point of the Corbyn leadership will be to fundamentally transform the party, rinse all the right-wingers out of it, then hand over the reins to someone more photogenic once the blood on the carpet has dried and the Blairites have been fucked off.

The lack of knowledge / understanding about things that are often considered 'standard' is troubling from a hiring perspective. I regularly find myself explaining the differences between the server and the client, for example, which seems very troubling to me since I know that many, if not most CS / dev courses will have some kind of server-client based classes or assignments at some point. People are graduating without understanding core concepts, and a lot of companies (particularly small-medium sized companies) often don't have the time or resources available to drag graduates up through the last 5-10 years of progress in the industry to get them up to speed. 

Part of the problem may be that things move very quickly in the world of computers / software in general, and so there is some degree of lag between academia and industry, but from my own experiences, it just feels like academia is failing to maintain pace. The number things that graduates need to know in order to 'start work' only ever increases, unless the company can afford to endlessly add new positions and split the job into very small, specialised areas (which then comes with its own problems).

I don't know what the solution is, but the problem does concern me. I've met people in the industry who dismiss everything I've just said, however, and who believe there is no problem because 'people just expect too much when they graduate and they need to work harder', which may have some truth to it bit kind of feels like just kicking the can down the road for somebody else to deal with.",null,0,null,1439019814,null,null,false,0,ctvqht7,null,t3_3g5ln6,null,null,null,t3_3g5ln6,null,null,null,1440354514,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,null,segagamer,eng-Surrey,Croydon,null,"&gt;I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that. Y'know weed isn't physically addictive right?

I've lost school friends to it, who end up getting into weed as a young teenager, and then by the time they reach their 20's, they shut off everyone who isn't involved in their group of buddies they can get high with (parents and siblings included), abandon their girlfriends or in some cases children, since they simply cannot afford to care for them whilst also getting their next toke. My uncle and aunt who were struggling for funds and would continuously complain how he barely had enough money for food and bills after his job seekers benefits, yet my uncle somehow managed to get money together for smoking weed.

Quick story, one of my best friends (who admittedly I ended up having a crush on) from high school approached me on Facebook stating that he was in a really tight spot and just needed an address to his name for a bit so he could put his life together after all of the above happened. I hadn't seen him in around 8 years, and wanted to meet him before saying yes. 

The previously built, attractive, sporty kind of guy that I knew from my teens became this scrawny man, who although completely sober sounded like he was permanently drunk, is what I saw. After speaking to his ex girlfriend (who I was friends with before) had to be reduced to living in his car and sofa surfing before he accepted that he had a problem, and she wouldn't have him back because of it. 

I said to him that I would be willing to help him out, but that if he's not going to pay for his keep whilst living here, then he would need to drop the smoking completely, as if he's too poor for food, then he's too poor for weed. 

He simply couldn't trust himself to keep that promise, worried that he might sabotage my trust in him and end up stealing stuff in my house to sell on to get money for his habit ""I like how it makes me feel too much to quit smoking, it helps me take my mind off things"" he said. He thanked me for the dinner I provided him with, and after saying our goodbyes, I haven't heard from him since. That was 2 years ago.

If the substance itself is not addictive, then it's the effects that is. Either way it's something that I have seen *can* be addictive, and something that certainly affects the person in question. I feel sorry for each and every person who ended up getting addicted to cannabis, really, I do, but I cannot sympathise with any of them who choose weed over sorting their life out. 


&gt;Do you think people are less likely or more likely to seek help if the drug they're using is legal?

An interesting point, but I don't think it's a factor. People will look for help whether it's legal or not *if they want it*. It's not like there isn't help for crack and cocaine addicts out there and readily available. The problem is getting them to recognise that they need help in the first place. 

We already have both cigarettes and alcohol as two dangerous and potentially addictive substances which are legal.

You'll have a party whose leader doesn't represent the majority of its members, let alone its MPs, peddling outdated economic rhetoric against a party which is improving its reputation for economic competence.

MPs, like any other organisation, have a hierarchy, MPs have to toe government/party line if they want to advance. Much like you may sing the praises of a product your company produces.  At the end of the day, policy is set by fairy complex mechanisms at a high level (I.e drugs, which is a political hot potato anyway).

That letter was most probably copy /pasted from the PRU - which allows MPs to present a unified voice of government. Good MPs will edit the letters to change personal views, if they are particularly adamant, or it's a fairly unimportant policy area.

Backbenchers may not use the PRU at all, and simply present their own views or their own interpretations.

TL;DR: one letter ain't gonna change jack.

People who are actively looking for work are not immune from sanctions. People with mental health issues can still look for work. 

Incidentally, some of these conditions aren't considered debilitating enough to be eligible for ESA so even when they are ill, they have to look for work or not have any means whatsoever to support themselves.

The issue mentioned in the article is saying that people with mental health issues are not vulnerable, and can wait a few weeks without any income, despite the fact that half of that list is pretty much the definition of vulnerable.

To quote Jon Cruddas summarising the result of his independent review of the election result released recently:

&gt;The first hard truth is that the Tories didn’t win despite austerity, they won because of it. Voters did not reject Labour because they saw it as austerity lite. Voters rejected Labour because they perceived the Party as anti-austerity lite. 58% agree that, ‘we must live within our means so cutting the deficit is the top priority’. Just 16% disagree. Almost all Tories and a majority of Lib Dems and Ukip voters agree.

&gt;Amongst working class C2DE voters 54% agree and 15% disagree. Labour voters are evenly divided; 32% agree compared to 34% who disagree.

&gt;In case people doubt the validity of this finding, we also asked people to agree or disagree with a number of other statements relating to the economy. 43 per cent agree that, ‘I am most likely to vote for the political party that redistributes wealth from rich to poor’, against 22% who do not. And 44% agree (37% amongst Labour voters) that, ‘ I am most likely to vote for the political party that puts my financial interests first’, against 17% (27% amongst Labour voters) who do not.

&gt;The electorate voted for fiscal responsibility. But as the statement on wealth distribution reveals the electorate also holds radical opinions on the economy. 60 per cent agree with the statement, ‘the economic system in this country unfairly favours powerful interests’. This rises to 73% amongst UKIP voters and 78% amongst Labour voters.

I bought this refurbished earlier this year and it's awesome. It's never
skipped a beat but I no longer have a use for it and wish to see it go to
someone who does.

**Specs:**

* Intel Core2 Duo (T7100) 1.80GHz
* 3GB RAM
* 80GB HDD
* Extended battery (lasts ~7+ hours!)
* Xubuntu operating system

It came with Windows 7 which could probably but reinstalled using the license
sicker on the underside of the machine. However, I'd encourage running
GNU/Linux instead as it's much faster, much more battery friendly, and it's
free. :)

Photos should show the condition - it was listed as grade A when I purchased it
from the refurb store and it really is smart looking. It's in perfect working
order with only a few small cosmetics: It has a [small hairline crack on the
bottom right of the case](http://i.imgur.com/UqKw3dx.jpg), it's missing a single
rubber foot on the bottom, and [the top has some general wear](http://i.imgur.com/XZ5gVYQ.jpg).

Any questions please ask!

&gt;The normal lifespan of a female cow is around 20 years old. The typical dairy cow, who goes through several rounds of forced impregnations, experiences a drop in milk production after five years. Dairy farmers cannot survive financially unless heifers are producing milk at maximum capacity. As a result, dairy cows not only routinely develop mastitis, but they enter the gates of the abattoir somewhere between the ages of 5-7. The vast majority of the nation’s cheap hamburger meat comes from the bodies of these “spent” dairy cows.

I think judging on the demographic of people volunteering and showing up to is rallies and  on twitter/Facebook a large amount are young people.

I agree it has to win over some swing voters, however after 2015 it's oblivious that if Labour continues to target them and takes it's core support for granted it will continue to lose voters it already has. The best bet is to try to win people over to your vision, rather then changing yours to suit public opinion. Look at what's happening to Burnham, it's clear people don't respond well to that.

Sakho, meanwhile, uses the ball better. He is more creative in possession and also doesn’t allow the forwards to get past him as regularly; a defender who is more comfortable on the front foot. With just two defensive errors, that is a big advantage over the error-strewn Lovren.

Statistics are not needed, necessarily, to show this – a look at the two in action last season would have sufficed. There are also intangibles which can only be determined during a game; intangibles which Sakho, admittedly, wins favour with.

null,null,volunteer24601,null,null,null,"Ok, I'm going to try and address every point you've made. I'm glad you agree with my point that Green and SNP votes aren't enough

a) UKIP voters demographically, and through surveys tend to be white, older and socially conservative. Labour really does have a problem with the white working class voters who have been the bedrock of their support. However, Corbyn will only push them away - he represents a younger, liberal, cosmopolitan, pro-immigration 'politically correct' 'liberal establishment. When people think that Labour don't represent them anymore, the solution is not to elect a North London MP whose spent 30 years in a hard-left political bubble. Nigel Farage is seen as an 'anti-politics' figure who stands up against 'political correctness.' Corbyn is just not like that - he oozes politics. 

Note that a Kendal win may well do the opposite, gain socially conservative voters but lose the younger urban liberal voters. Not particularly relevant but interesting how Labour's support is increasingly split between these two groups

b) *judging on the demographic of people volunteering and showing up to is rallies and on twitter/Facebook a large amount are young people. Well only 4/10 young people voted - it's reasonable to assume he could win over large amounts of them.*

Firstly, never trust social media to be representative of the electorate. If Twitter was representative, then Scotland would be independent and Labour would have won the election

As for young people (not) voting - 2010 was the height of Clegg-mania and still only 44% of 18-25 year olds voted. Lots of young people who don't vote just don't give a single shit about politics and simply aren't going to vote. In fact generally this is the truth about politics. *People who don't vote, don't vote* and appealing to them is trying to win Eurovision but appealing to people who hate music. Laudable goal, but not going to work

 c)*I agree it has to win over some swing voters, however after 2015 it's oblivious that if Labour continues to target them and takes it's core support for granted it will continue to lose voters it already has.*

Under FPTP winning swing voters is *everything.* Winning the party faithful is not enough to win elections. It never has, either for Labour or the Tories. 

2015 was actually the clearest example of Labour trying to win on it's core support - the fabled '35%' strategy of winning hardcore Labour voters plus some Lib Dem defectors and swing voters to crawl over the line. And it manifestly failed. And those voters are leaving to UKIP, as well as the Tories (due to fear of the SNP in some cases.) 

And electing Corbyn would lose  those swing voters, and lib dem voters. Labour would do great in inner cities, and the faithful would love how 'pure' they were. But Labour would lose. And lose again.

d) *The best bet is to try to win people over to your vision, rather then changing yours to suit public opinion.*

Convincing people of a grand political vision is noble. But doomed. You cannot ignore the electorate. When the Labour party wins it's because it is in tune with the public mood. Think Attlee and the hope for a bright world post-war. Or Wilson and the prosperity and liberalism of the 60s. 

This doesn't mean abandoning your principles, just recognizing that you have to adapt them to the times we live in. Adapt or die. This is what the Conservatives often realise better than Labour. Cameron tried for years to modernise his party, and now they are making aggressive steps to try and win over blue collar workers. 'Traditional values' often come both from the hard left and right, as partisans think that if only they stick to their principles enough, then the public will back them. 

And I want to see a Labour government again.

And as I have repeatedly said, Corbyn's vison would push away the swing and centrist voters that Labour needs to win.

e) * Look at what's happening to Burnham, it's clear people don't respond well to that.*

Yeah, this is the danger of going too far the other way. I think he's just desperate.

f)  *I also think Corbyn would increase support for views that favour the Lib Dems, which would increase their chances of taking back marginal seats that they lost to the Tories which would eat into their majority.*

Corbyn would increase support for the Lib Dems as centrist voters who don't like the Tories would go back to them. This may eat into their majority, but it would also really harm Labour in marginals.

And eating into majorities, isn't enough. Labour needs to win a majority. It needs to win about a 100 seats to become the government. It's a monumental task. And to win it, you need a broad coalition of voters, and to understand the public mood. And Corbyn just can't do that. 

And I want to see a Labour government again.

Take my word for it. Support for equal marriage rights is really high over here with both unionists and nationalists.

We did exactly the same things then as we did with Baldini - took a risk, spent a bit of cash and hoped for the best.

The season Modric was bought was also the season Bentley was bought for ~£15m and look how that worked out, Dos Santos too for £5m, Bostock. The season before Bent for ~£17m (a £17m failure, why does that sound familiar?), Gilberto, Boateng, Hutton, Gunter.....

Fact is you're completely disregarding the many failures for the two bright sparks. Now, Baldini brought in Dier, Chadli, Eriksen, Alli and you're focusing completely on the negatives.

Poland has been a homogeneous state for the past 70 years and people do not have experiences with immigration, so their attitude in Poland is largely affected by the experiences (to some extent) and (to a larger extent) narrative coming from Western Europe - people in UK and France bitch about lack of integration, ghettos etc and then go 'Those bloody Poles do not want the people that we claim are causing problems'.

* Poles are cynical, somewhat self-loathing and lacking in national confidence and pride despite the incredible progress the country has made in just ten years; you can hardly blame them and this is bound to change in a decade or two, but right now the common mentality amongst the young is to try get out of what they percieve to be a shithole of a country - an immigrant nation out to make their own luck.

They do get along pretty well with the few Germans and other Slavs who hang around there, but considering pretty much every country in Europe is inclined to tell the refugees to fuck off anyway, gee I do wonder why Poland in particular isn't very keen either.

null,null,EmilioRebenga,null,null,null,"&gt;Ordinarily my gut reaction would be that special forces selection needs to be special, and people should stop complaining. But if the tests are literally killing people, they probably do need to be toned down, even if just a little bit.

My initial reaction was it is unacceptable that people died, but what can you do you can't make it any easier for obvious reasons? I then saw a good [BBC documentary on it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b061z5w8/week-in-week-out-beyond-the-call-of-duty)
Basically, even some ex-special forces guys were saying we don't want it to be made any easier, we just want monitoring to be in place. 

Keep it hard but if you notice a guy lying on the floor not moving for 4 hours then you might want to check if he is dead or not. That was literally the example for the 3 guys. 

A really good, short documentary to explain what happened I would recommend it. It explained the situation in a lot more detail than the press tended too and spoke to those most involved in the case.

The tests just need to be monitored properly. Key findings from it were that they need to monitor the wellbeing of the participants and that if it is hazardous, they should call it off instead of just not bothering because of the mountain of paperwork, as was hinted in there.
Also it did say that MoD budget cuts may have been responsible but that was inconclusive. 

edit:
Forgot that they didn't take one of the guys to a hospital quick enough, delayed his medical treatment and he subsequently got renal failure and died about a month later. There were horrific problems in procedure here totally unrelated to the difficulty of the selection criteria involved and were therefore, potentially totally unnecessary.",null,0,null,1439034777,null,null,1439039711,0,ctvtv4i,null,t3_3g85ou,null,null,null,t1_ctvrgos,null,null,null,1440356166,null,21,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21,null

5' | | [Chance for Spurs](http://gfycat.com/FoolishMarriedGartersnake) | | Eriksen |  | Good pressure from Davies and Chadli sees Kane get the ball, and he chips to an onside Eriksen, whose chip of Romero is just a bit too high.
17' |  | [Misc](http://gfycat.com/QuickUncommonCur) |  | Romero | | Under no real pressure, Romero inexplicably passes the ball out of bounds.
18' |  | [Chance for Spurs](http://gfycat.com/WeightyOblongIndianpalmsquirrel) |  | Walker | | A good over the top ball from Eriksen finds Walker, who can't quite control it before Romero can smother it.
22' |  | [Goal for United](http://gfycat.com/LightheartedPositiveHornedviper) (1-0) |  | Walker (OG) | | Mata intercepts a poor Bentaleb pass, leading United to a counter. Rooney has a ball squared to him, but a recovering Walker takes it off his feet, unfortunately placing it past Vorm's right.
27' |  | [Yellow](http://gfycat.com/GeneralDisloyalAiredaleterrier) |  | Vertonghen | | Late challenge on Mata by Jan. Good position for United. Mata's subsequent free kick is stopped by the wall.
36' |  | [Chance for United](http://gfycat.com/FavoriteUnequaledFishingcat) |  | Mata | | A poor Alderweireld pass leads to a United counter. Mata's initial effort is blocked, but his follow-up finds a way through; however it ends up wide. Always a difficult chance.
45' |  | [Misc](http://gfycat.com/ZestyIncredibleDove) |  | Romero | | More adventures with Romero's distribution, this time under good pressure from Kane.

67' |  | [Chance for Spurs](http://gfycat.com/WatchfulPracticalCanadagoose) |  | Dembele | | Great headed interception from Dier leads to a quick counter for Spurs, but Dembele's early cross to Chadli is sniffed out by Romero.

10' Kane working the sideline, ball goes out for a goal kick 

12' Man U working the ball, but some good defensive clearances

14' Eriksen with a cross that goes wide

17' First mistake by Romero, kicks ball out by himself, let's hope we can capitalize!

18' CHANCE!! Eriksen with a lovely chipped ball to Walker who couldn't get it around the keeper. Some good possession by Tottenham here.

20' Walker with some good defense, foul called on Dembele

22' **OWN GOAL** - Bentaleb with a give away in the middle of the park leads to a break away that Rooney shoots but deflects off Walker and in to the goal.

27' **YELLOW** for Vert. Man U have dominated possession since the goal. Kane looks starved of service up top by himself. COYS

31' Man U pressing higher now, Spurs having a hard time building out of the back. Dier and Bentaleb need to be careful because Man U players are right on their backs

35' Mata shot goes wide. Again a giveaway in the middle of the park as we try to build out leads to a 3 on 3 counter attack. Tottenham needs to relax and regain their composure. 

41' Game has slowed down. Lots of give aways in the midfield have led to majority of Man U's chances. Kane pretty isolated

45' Romero with his second blunder. 

46' Long free kick leads to a shot by Aldierweild. 

**HALFTIME** Thoughts? I think we can still come back just need to regain our composure. Before the own goal we were playing well and had an early chance. Just got to be a bit more clinical. COME ON YOU SPURS!

45' And we are off! Let's do this boys

49' We steal the ball in their half 2v1 but can't capitalize on the final pass. 

52' Spurs making some chances now, Bentaleb sends Chadli through who backheels it to Walker to center but it's cleared by Man U 

53' **SUB IN: MASON ///// OUT: BENTELEB**

57' Blind fouls Eriksen leads to a free kick and almost got it! 

58' **SUB IN: SCHWINGSTIGER //// OUT: CARRICK** Game stopped for Rooney who is down with a head injury (?), he's alright

65' Shot by Ashley leads to a save by Vorm, game is back and forth at the moment

67' CHANCE - Dembele set free by Eriksen and sends in a cross for Chadli, but Romero comes off his line early and grabs it

68' **SUB IN: HERREA //// OUT: DEPAY**
**SUB IN: LAMELA //// OUT: DEMBELE**


73' Rooney goes for the bicycle kick off the cross, but no good

75' **YELLOW FOR DIER** cuz Ashley dived outside box

76' **SUB IN: ALLI /// OUT: DIER** who will he meg today???

80' **SUB: IN: VALENCIA /// OUT: DARMIAN** - Both clubs out of subs now

84' CHADLI!!! What a chance, he holds on to the ball too long but was by himself on the 6 yard box!

 * Hinkley C will cost £24.5 Billion to build and will be owned by a French energy company.   It will never reduce bills because the strike price is set in stone.  
 * In Woking the local council built a gas generator that provides heat and electricity to local homes and business with a private wire.  It is actually cheaper than buying from the grid.  And the investment is made locally.
 * Install solar panels on your roof.  Once the capital costs are paid you can produce free energy.

I would love it if we had a mature nuclear industry that could compete with renewable's but we don't.  This is the reality....

* ManU is scum

null,null,MancombQSeepgood,null,null,null,"Wolfson isn't a grad only college per se, but it will certainly feel like it. The vast majority of the students are on MPhil courses so you'll certainly meet a lot of people who are new and only here for less than a year. This makes it easy to make a lot of friends. The student body is also mostly international, which is pretty cool.

Wolfson is quite laid back, casual, and fun. The food at formals is considered to be the best out of all the colleges (even beating out the formals at Trinity and John's). I recommend trying out for various sports, as the chances to make the teams are higher here than at some of the bigger colleges, and that is also a nice way to make connections. The weight room seems small and pathetic, but it is actually one of the better college gyms I've seen. 

Accommodation isn't something I can speak to with great authority other than to say the blocks all seem about the same. The blocks closer to the library are currently being remodelled, so that's what I would go for, but it's closer to the bell which rings every hour. The rooms have private bathrooms and shared kitchens for each (maybe) 5 students or so. Depending on what programme you are doing and how you like to do your work, I would recommend going with the most affordable room, as I found that I was seriously only in my flat to sleep (and of that, not too many hours per night. Cambridge MPhils can be intense).

In my opinion, the greatest strength of wolfson is the library. It's small and doesn't have a lot of the books you might need, but it's 24 hour access and they treat you like an adult. You can have food and drinks in there, it's comfortable, and Meg the librarian is super cool and will order books you might need with little hassle. I had 24 hour access at my faculty, so I didn't use the library at wolfson as much as I could have, but when I did I really liked it.",null,0,null,1439035207,null,null,false,0,ctvtz54,null,t3_3g5558,null,null,null,t3_3g5558,null,null,null,1440356219,null,1,null,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,1,null

Good early interchanges, unlucky not to score for Eriksen.

Dier looks fantastic in that DM role, Bentaleb on the other hand has been poor all half. The giveaway for the goal was inexcusable and smacks of laziness/ tiredness from having played midweek. 

&amp;nbsp;

Id bring lamela on in the second half just to shake things up a little. Maybe move Chadli up a little and take dembele off or move him back and take Bentaleb off.

The only silver lining about that goal is at least that fat Shrek looking cunt wont get the credit for it.

Oh my gosh, yes. Yes, it is exceedingly hard to get a visa, even if you studied in the U.K., have a Ph.D. and a well paying job and married a British national. They make you jump through hundreds of hoops.

To apply for asylum from overseas you need to be living in a UN refugee camp and apply through the U.N. The application process can take up to ten years. The camps are often exceedingly dangerous and impoverished. If you're already in the country it can take I think up to three years, during which time you're in a safe place.

There are people who go through the process overseas - I used to work with some in Australia - but you can bet that if they had had the means to do it more quickly, they would have.

Edit:  Remembered a story I was told by an old village copper in the Canterbury area involving Howlett's Zoo.

""I was driving along a lane near Littlebourne and I saw what I thought was a dog up ahead in the road.  As I got closer I thought ""That's a big dog"" then ""Dog's don't have stripes"".  So now I'm sat in my car, in a single track lane, with a tiger just in front of the car blocking the road.  

I looked out the back window to try and reverse back up the road away from it, but there was another car behind and the women driver was frozen with fear.  I tried to signal to her to reverse up the road, but she was completely frozen.

I turned back around to look out the windscreen and the tiger had now moved, it was now stood by the side of the car, peering in at me, steaming the outside of the window up.  I shuffled across into the passenger seat and made an effort to grab my radio to call it in.  In one swift move the tiger jumped over the top of the car and was peering in at me through the passenger window.

I just sat there thinking ""oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck"", before the tiger decided it was bored of me and jumped over a hedge into a field and headed off in the direction of Littlebourne.  I radioed it in and was laughed at by control, until they got hold of Howlett's and they confirmed an escape.

I drove back towards Littlebourne, to try and find it again, and warn people to stay in their homes.  Apparently most the village already knew, since the postman had seen tiger cubs walking about.  I only came across one person, a young mum pushing her baby in a pram.  I remember screaming at her to get inside as quickly as possible and maybe a minute or two later I spotted the tiger again in someone's front garden.  I called in again and in no time at all keepers from Howlett's were on the scene and shot it dead.  I asked them why they didn't tranquilise it and they replied that, as you could see it was already angry and distressed, the tranquiliser takes a while to kick in so then you'd have a really pissed off, angry and distressed tiger out in the open""

My best googling managed to turn up this [blog](http://kentbigcats.blogspot.co.uk/2007_05_01_archive.html) on the subject.

He also told me whilst it was still John Aspinall's private collection, escapes happened more frequently and wouldn't have been surprised if some weren't always reported.

few issues, wind isn't guaranteed meaning even if you store the power in batteries you could still run out - some people don't like the look (whatever, i think they look great but its a subjective thing) - they do make a fair amount of noise at full tilt and its fairly inefficient to have turbines in towns/cities instead of up on hills where there is far more wind.

null,null,AmerieHartree,,Democracy is the most revolutionary thing in the world,null,"&gt; ..in the late 1980s and early 1990s, rumours sometimes swirled: the names of various senior politicians were whispered in connection with alleged sexual abuse of children..  And in all my time there, working as private secretary to Sir Edward Heath, I never once heard his name mentioned in this context.

Is this really so surprising? If rumours were swirling around Whitehall about Heath, it's perfectly possible that a private secretary to the man would not be made privy to these rumours, especially if people understood him to be loyal to Heath.

&gt; By the time I was working for Sir Edward (1988-1992), he no longer sailed, but part of my job was to arrange reunions of former crew members. They were a tight-knit group from a wide variety of backgrounds, with a close camaraderie and used to living at close quarters on board. Had Sir Edward jumped ship once in Jersey for a couple of hours to get up to no good, they would have noticed his absence. The whole idea is inconceivable. 

Frankly, it is this argument which I find inconceivable. A tight-knit group of friends and acquaintances, at least one of whom was at some point involved at a high level of government, protecting each other from the law? It's perfectly conceivable.

&gt; The same is true of some of the other allegations aired this week, which cover the period after 1965 when he became Leader of the Opposition.. He would have had a government driver and, from 1970 when he was elected as Prime Minister, would also have had Special Branch officers with him at all times, right up to his death in 2005. 

Given several recent disclosures surrounding similar cases, I'm not entirely convinced that Special Branch, at the time, were a trustworthy organization.

Disregarding these specific issues with the article, I'd like to touch on a broader point - that of, as the article says, 'What has happened to the principle of innocent until proven guilty?'
Now, there are a few distinctions to be made here; there is accepting and believing Heath was guilty of these offences before the public has been presented with any real evidence or judgement, there is 'the principle of innocence until proven guilty', and there is dismissing the accusations out of hand before the public has been presented with any real evidence or judgement. Depending on the outcome, the first and last options could be just as incorrect or damaging as each other, and I feel it is important to stress that it is duplicitous to conflate the principle of innocence until proven guilty with the last option. I have also seen a fair few articles in the media adopting the last position over the last few days, which strikes me as rather too rash - If I was a columnist, I certainly wouldn't be risking my reputation by making such statements at such a time.",null,0,null,1439040219,null,null,1439042523,0,ctvviej,null,t3_3g8n2l,null,null,null,t3_3g8n2l,null,null,null,1440356944,null,2,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

They operate on very thin margins thanks to supermarkets using them as loss-leaders. That's why they're subsidised throughout Europe. 

&gt; You obviously can't have a trade surplus on every single product, and if other countries are able to produce milk more cheaply then it makes sense to import it.

Correct, but on something that cannot so easily be increased in volume, more tact needs to be taken with it. There's many factors to that market, which is why it's so volatile. 

What if the Euro was to bounce back? Or if the Pound was to drop? The cheap imported dairy product won't beat domestic pricing, and that's not an instantaneous buy-order. It takes years to cultivate and grow a large herd. As a primary industry it affects a large portion of our domestic as well as exported secondary dairy industry. Cheese, butter, powdered milk etc.

Hi there, I'm looking for the following:

- The Air 540. Should be in decent condition.
- Any Asus X99 Pro/Deluxe variant. A USB 3.1 version is preferable. I only have around £220 to spend on a motherboard as I'm running out of budget. Would like some sort of warranty with it.
- An Ultrawide or decent 4K monitor, let me know what you have.

Kane was a bit lackluster, mostly because he’d get surrounded in the first two seconds and nobody would be there to help out. Chadli doesn’t get a rating because he didn’t do shit.

Really, if we played with the intensity that we had in the first 20 and last 10 minutes, we’d be much better set. But we decide to lightly jog about and then complain that we didn’t have enough chances. Disappointing.

The fact that the DM is going with this makes me think there is some credibility to the idea that having seen the apparent groundswell of popular support for Corbyn, they and their right wing pals are actually getting worried enough to put some effort into smearing him rather than just trying to ridicule him.

- Toby looked really great.  He looked completely unflappable.

- Alli looked bright in his time, I think we'll see more of him

- How about Eric Dier!?  He has a knack for stepping up to the bigger stages, and I think that's pretty impressive

- I think we definitely need one more offensive option.  Chadli was making GREAT runs all game, and a healthy Pritchard will spell Eriksen, but having another option on the left to platoon with Chadli/Kane in the middle seems like it would be incredibly helpful to the longevity of the squad-- I don't think Bentaleb lays another egg like that.  It's, as far as I can remember, the first real bad game I've seen from him.

- I honestly don't think we need to go out and buy a DM before January, if we're shown to need one.  I am gaining confidence in a midfield team of Alli/Bentaleb/Mason/Dier as being capable of rising to the challenge

- We made one egregious mistake today and were punished for it by a team that could likely challenge for the league.  We were the better team outside of that moment though, probably deserved an equalizer, and have a lot to be proud of honestly.

&gt;In the United Kingdom, sympathy strikes were outlawed by the Trade Disputes and Trade Union Act of 1927 in the aftermath of the general strike. This was repealed by the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1946, passed by the post-war Labour Government.

&gt;Solidarity action remained legal until 1980, when the Conservative Government of Margaret Thatcher passed the Employment Act 1980 which restricted it. This was followed a decade later by the Employment Act 1990, which outlawed solidarity action entirely. The laws outlawing solidarity strikes remain to this day. In 2005, union leaders in the U.K. called for the legalisation of solidarity strikes in the aftermath of the strike action against the catering company Gate Gourmet but Labour ministers stated that they had no intention of repealing the law.

Eriksen seemed to give the ball away quite a lot, and what a different game it would have been if he had converted that early chance. I thought Kane looked good in what few touches he had. Dembele impressed, as did Dier.

Now compare that to our performances last year at the start. How much sharper did we look today than this time last year? How many clubs can go to Manchester and leave with more shots and more shots on target than United? How many lose a nail-biting game due to a fluke own goal?

It was a fantastic performance. We look really, really good for being this early in the season. It's looking great. COYS.",null,0,null,1439042581,null,null,false,0,ctvwefr,null,t3_3g8qdh,null,null,null,t3_3g8qdh,null,null,null,1440357362,null,4,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,4,null

It's why you constantly see people on here crying out for a DM.

I'm not even saying that what we should do, just pointing out that it's a very reasonable option that has plenty of logic behind it as a choice.  ESPECIALLY for this game where Firmino isn't expected to start in the first place because of fitness and comfort issues and we've got a serious point to prove so we need to make sure the likes of Charlie fucking Adam don't tear us a new asshole again.

I personally don't even think it'll happen.  I think it's going to be Hendo/Milner in the middle, maybe joined by Coutinho depending on the shape BR wants the team to take.

null,null,NikkiJayne28,null,null,null,"I've studied at both Kent and the OU, and I'll completely echo what /u/Timothy_Claypole has said.

I'll also add that despite my OU course being part time, I found it both more demanding and more time consuming than being at 'regular' uni. I would always encourage someone to go to brick-and-mortar uni because of the experience you get there - first time living away from home for most, being surrounded by likeminded people, and just generally shunning responsibilities and having a whale of a time. Because the OU is mainly populated by older students, there is much less of a sense of slacking off and a lot more of a sense of taking your responsibilities seriously. The OU is no place for people with no discipline or who lack motivation.

When it comes to teaching, I'd say they're on a par. Good teachers are the norm but like everywhere, a few bad ones can slip through the cracks. In one of my years at the OU one of my tutors was a seriously harsh marker - when one of my essays that year was marked by another tutor, I got 10% higher than I had been averaging - it's fair to say that OU tutors expect a lot from you!

Also, when I attended tutorials at the OU, I felt pretty dumb. At Kent I was surrounded by other 18-20 year olds, at the OU I was surrounded by retirees who had a lifetime of experience and knowledge behind them.

What do you mean? 

My best friend from secondary school is Bulgarian, his family moved here around 14 years ago which is when I first met him. Just like the Polish people I've worked with they're very hard working and came here to work hard and have a better life. 

His English was very poor when I met him in year 7, and he was timid, but now if you met him you wouldn't be able to guess he isn't originally from here. His family, unlike most asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, made a conscious effort to assimilate and fit in. 

They made the choice to move to an area of my city which wasn't an immigrant area, still cheap area. Where the majority (easily 90%+) are white British, but in the city there are vast areas of cheap housing which is now heavily Muslim, but still like at the time primarily Eastern Europeans, but they chose near me.  

My point is, when it comes to whether people like you or not as group of people who are immigrants, be it legal or illegal, it comes down to if you try to fit in or not. If they seek out others like them and make no effort to assimilate into the host nation, and to mix with the locals, then you'll stand out, and be ""different"" and honestly look ungrateful for not trying to fit into the country which has taken you in. Some groups of people are more likely to not try and fit in than others. 


**Edit:**

So I defend immigrants as I have many as friends, and work with many more whom I all like. I ask what the guy means by ""They've moved onto Romanians/Bulgarians."" as I see them as hard working people here for a better life. But I'm getting hate because some guy who isn't even an immigrant is trying to sell me a sob story that has nothing to do with what I've said here. I'm not saying his stuff isn't bad, I just don't think it has any bearing with what I've said here.

Since they weren't challenged on this point I think it's something that was given to them. Labour ran a pro-austerity campaign, so the argument against austerity was never made.

And since the objective economic evidence, and the broad consensus amongst the economics profession that austerity has been and continues to be disaster, this shouldn't be a hard case to make, but Labour timidity makes it impossible.

&gt;Scotland's a terrible example. The Scots tend to vote as one more than elsewhere. 

No they don't. Scottish voting habits are perfectly normal within the realms of British politics historically. The fact all 3 major parties collapsed there is just one, close to home, example of how insurgent parties are wiping out their establishment parties but you can pick from a list of other European countries doing the same thing if you need more evidence of the sort of thing I'm talking about.

&gt;There are also no real identity sentiments (as with nationalism) underlining and supercharging the Corbyn campaign. 

If you think that some vague notion of ""identity"" is why the entire political establishment has had it's collective arse kicked in Scotland then you're a fool. There's much more to it than that.

&gt;It's mostly younger people and the internet -- not exactly that representative of the UK or wider block of voters.

No-one's claiming that it is representative, but it is drawing huge amounts of interest from outside the moribund and stale political anoraks who join parties and participate in politics, and that's a good thing. With some momentum and some good luck they could essentially rebuild the Labour party as a social force.

&gt;This country is remarkably well governed and traditional.

Haha only if you're fuckign deluded. Britain is a mega corrupt, totally mismanaged, travesty. A massive floating hedge fund riddled with corruption which is institutionally legalised and defended by the major parties. Britain is *terribly* governed.

&gt;In times of chaos, you can bet your house the electorate will vote Conservative, not Syriza. 

I wouldn't make any sort of blithe statement talking about how the electorate ought to be behave. The electorate is not social physics, and the ""rules"" of how they should or shouldn't behave are being torn up. 

&gt;But they aren't. Most people are doing pretty well, even if there is always room for improvement.

This is your narrow world-view and sheltered background showing through. Most people are not going ""pretty well"" we've just lived through the worst depression since the 1930's, the slowest economic recovery every recorded, and the longest period of real-terms wage stagnation since the 1830's.

null,null,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt;He really doesn't to the point where conservatives a signing up to the Labour Party just to vote for him.

PR stunt. Means nothing.

&gt;What he is doing is offering the only alternative to centrist policies of the other candidates. This means, just like the SNP in Scotland, he is offering the only option for a particular group of voters whereas the opposing vote will be split amongst the other candidates. This will lead to him winning the leadership contest, but I'll wager that the combined votes for the other candidates will be greater than the votes for Corbyn and then what?

Well it's transferrable vote system, so he'll end up with 50%+ of the vote to become leader, on 2nd preferences I suspect. Either way and whatever Corbyn's popularity totally outstrips anyone else on the centre of the party. If you fancy a bet though....

&gt;peddling outdated economic rhetoric against a party which is improving its reputation for economic competence.

Outdated? Says who? Economic competence? Could you please rephrase these vague buzzwords with something specific that actually relates. 

For what it's worth in terms of economic competence it's the pro-austerity people who are lacking. There is no economist worth shit in the world today who supports what they're doing. Austerity is a proven and toal failure that has cost every taxpayer in this country money as a result of it's staggering stupidity. if/when we get another 12 billion strong cut, along with the deficit-increasing tax giveaways to the ultra-rich in inheritance tax cuts that Osborne's given away, you'll get to see it all again. 

&gt;Modern elections will continue to be won in the centre ground

The last election was won by the Tories on a very right-wing totally rigid basis. This is utter nonsense. Agan, another platitue from people who aren't actually watching what's going on around them.

&gt;There is no secret, silent majority of leftists ready to leap to Labour's cause and bring them to power

Well actually the biggest problem for Labour in pure electoral terms isn't the Tories but low turnout in it's core voter categories, which is a problem that is on record since 2005. If young people turned out for elections with the same sort o regularity as pensioners then we'd have a Labour government with a large majority right now. 

Labour last far more seats to the SNP than to the Tories, and they lost more voters to UKIP and Green than Tories too. Even if they moved to the centre this would only damage the party more since for every Tory swing voter they'd pick up they'd lose 3 to Greens/UKIP/SNP and the more intelligent Labour people know it so the New Labour strategy can't work.

And finally it's not enough to simply ""win over"" certain categories of voter, they need to actually make their arguments vigourously and not tacitly accept the premise of Tory policy. No other candidate apart from Corbyn can do that. They need to re-build their party infrastructure, start reconnecting with the large areas of the country which aren't turning out to vote, they need to win people over and motivate the apathetic, that is of a higher priority than simply focusing on the same few swing voters in the marginals.

I find it hilarious that people churn out the recieved wisdom at a time throughout Europe where we've seen, time and time again, things that were impossible happening, people who were unelectablee getting elected, and where the electorate has defied expectations in so many ways.

Yes but the Labour party didn't challenge it. Despite the fact that the evidence is on their side, they capitulated to a narrative pre-determined by a hostile pro-Tory media. Unless they are prepared to put up a fight on this score then it doesn't matter who they elect as leader the same thing would happen to a Blairite. 

&gt;I'm not denying that it is happening somewhat, but only that in this country it will get to the same state as our partners on the mainland. 

What possibly reason could you suggest that we would somehow be exempt? If anything I think the conditions for a total collapse of the established parties are even better here than elsewhere in Europe! But that's a big digression...

&gt;mean well governed in a factual, descriptive sense -- the system is designed to keep out fringe parties and to temper radicalism. 

So the weakness of Britain's democracy is the reason?

Harborne is expensive and is a mixture of young professionals and families (next to the hospital and university)but again is expensive, bus access to town or train if by the university. Edgbaston is varied - includes some of the most expensive parts of the city but also some areas which are less so but parts are near to town. The local trains are fantastic to get into Birmingham city centre. Selly Oak is ten minutes on the train (run every ten minutes) to town but is mainly where students live (directly by the station), Bournville is the next stop and is a very nice family suburb, then Kings Norton which is fairly nice. Rent outside of the city centre is obviously a lot less. At least a couple of years ago Stirchley and Cotteridge were the best value (nice area but pretty low prices for a terraced house). I don't know what they're called but there's a new development of flats next to canon hill park which is on a great bus route and next to an aldi as well as a lovely park which might be worth looking up.

This bit of reporting was the latest in a string of reports by this BBC journalist which the fans and the club feel are unbalanced and unfair.

If you want to know why we feel this way about this most recent incident, then why not go back and re-read what I wrote in my original post, instead of just dismissing what I wrote out of hand? 

I'm still waiting for you to present a single argument for why what I have written there is not valid.

If you are not familiar with the aspects of this journalists reporting that Rangers fans have an issue with in general then it might be better for you to just consider yourself uniformed on the subject and stop throwing around accusations which you seemingly cannot back up with any supporting arguments.

The irony is that this is a bigoted statement.

It isn't a one-way street, so much as I understand the desire to shift the narrative, this is much harder to do if the electorate doesn't trust you to begin with. Going in all guns blazing saying, ""You've been lied to all along! And are all consequently wrong/deluded;*trust us instead!"" isn't going to win back their trust, but it will raise eyebrows. 

Austerity is as much a moral position as an economic one, so opposing it factually won't really be enough. Neither will being staunchly opposed in a moral sense because most people simply don't agree. They simply prefer the notion of ""living within our means"" etc. In difficult times, I think this small-c conservative country simply won't take to a complete upturn, it will only move gradually and tentatively. 

As I say, we are exempt because of how well governed this country is. For all its flaws and the flaws of successive governments etc etc, we're nowhere near being in the kind of situation that Greece, Spain, Italy or even France are. So while we may be feeling similar political and economic forces, I highly doubt we will be pushed over the edge and overrun by them. We'll just have to wait and see, I suppose. 

Strength/weakness of democracy is irrelevant. It's too subjective to really base this on, and wasn't what I was thinking in the slightest. There's room for reform, no doubt, but it is also true that this is one of the most well-established and successful democracies/economies in the world.

That's not realistic.

&gt; Mate you can't just turn a farm from being a dairy farm one minute and then a wheat farm the next, the physical environment will not cope with it.

I don't have any expertise in this area, but a quick google says that [you often can](http://www.npr.org/2011/04/12/135354092/the-corn-belt-debate-crops-or-cattle). And even for those who can't, there are other uses for land, like housing. If your farm isn't self-sustaining, sell the land to a property developer and retire. People as asset-rich as farmers shouldn't be asking for charity.

&gt; Your final post, that they should raise milk prices, is probably the best solution.

That's not what I said, but sure, I encourage farmers who need to to demand a higher price for milk.

**Positives**

* Richards good defensively in 2nd half. Actually, -very- good 2nd half. 

* Clark good as always, what a beast! Feel safe with him

* Amavi excellent! Good defence, killer forward runs. 

* Even Bacuna was good in defence... Defence in general was very decent. Mid table stuff. 

* Gestede ;) Cheeky header. That's what he's here for

* Good saves/control by Guzan

* With Grealish, Gil, and Kozak gone, we were not playing with a lot of our best attacking players. Explains some of indecisiveness and poor quality.

* Gabby made some nice runs (though I also include him in the bad side). Decent game, especially 2nd half.  

**the bad...**

* Guzan's kicking is absolutely dire. What, he bottled like 3 goal kicks? like wtf? 

* Midfield was horrendous. I know Bournemouth were pressing... But what's up with not holding on to the ball and making shitty passes? I've been impressed by Gueye in friendlies, but he wasn't great this game. Veretout OKAY

* Westwood absolutely non-existant... I mean, where the hell was he? Would rather have a skullcrusher like Sanchez in if Westwood isn't gonna provide anything offensively, let alone doing nothing on the defensive end. 

* Gabby being Gabby..... sometimes had highlights, but I still don't think he's quality to start for us.  (Although I understand since Gestede is new and Kozak is out why he might be for this match)

* Little to say about Ayew, though I wasn't hugely impressed. Not really fair since he was getting no service and no one held on to the ball, but it was quiet for him methinks.

Positives: Howard looked solid, nothing he could do about either goal, commanded the box well, and distributed accurately. Cleverly and Barry looked good, Mirallas was a threat, Lukaku improved massively in the second half, and Kone had a really, really good game, so kudos. And Ross needed that goal, which was an absolute screamer. Hopefully that will give him the confidence to kick on this season. Good service in the second half from just about everyone, just couldn't quite make it tell.

Negatives: Defense looked shaky at best. First goal is probably on Stones, he needs to get his head on that cross, As for the second goal, really good play by Ighalo (sp?), but Stones commited to a block too early, and maybe a slight deflection off of Coleman.

Overall, the first half was atrocious, the second half was very good. Given our usual struggles on the first day of the season and our fight in the second half, I'm not terribly upset. Can't say I'm pleased with the officiating. A couple dodgy offside calls, Coleman's yellow that shouldn't have been, and of course, deeney should have been sent off in the first half.

Takeaways: Kone looked very good, hopefully he can keep that up. Defense needs work. And two strikers work, Lads.  Imagine if we do get Austin, and Kone actually shows up.

I think against teams that will sit deep and defend 2 strikers up top is a must - it was used at the back end of last seasons to extract results and it certainly did that.

Otherwise it's sad that it took until the second half for the team to wake up. Galloway played well, as did Barry. The biggest weaknesses were Stones and Jagielka actually, and I imagine there'll be some snide comments on MOTD and on Twitter tonight. However last season Martinez would have not altered his formation, so his aim to do it early this season shows positivity and a willigness for change.

Richards good as well, stuck to the middle, other than the misclear I'd say a good game

Guzan made some great saves but also some boneheaded mistakes, I'll chalk it up to being tired after the Gold Cup, but worrying.

Lovely to bag a good win early on, should give everyone a nice confidence boost to build on.

Mahrez. No doubt. Always looked positive, he was creative and got 2 goals as compensation.

&gt;What did you think of the team's performance + rating (out of 5)?

4 - Thought we got a little flustered at the back at times but our pace and play going forward was brilliant to see (looking at Mahrez, Vardy and Schlupp). Thought Albrighton had a solid game as well but credit to the rest of the team of course.

Something I did was get myself an extremely basic bank account (from smile at the time) I.e. No overdraft facility, hardly any interest, easily manageable online. I then set a payment from my personal account into this one and had as many DDs as I could come out of it.

Later on, when I got married, we set up a joint account (through Santander, and then later conveyed it to a 1-2-3 account which has been awesome). We worked out what we needed to pay each month, added half of a bit more than our average monthly shopping bill each and then run that. This means we run our household efficiently, and our pay, after bills etc. is our own. We also added a joint savings to the mix since we'd been running it a while and both pay into that automatically every month as well, building up a large ""rainy day"" provision.

* Joe Allen's beard is really **really** **REALLY** great.

* Moreno isn't good enough, Flannagan is better.

* Rodgers should be sacked and replaced by Klopp

* Rodgers should be sacked and replaced by De Boer

* Rodgers is absolutely the right man for the job and will get us back to the Champions League.

* If Sturridge wasn't made of glass, he'd be the best striker in the league.

* Dejan Lovren isn't good enough.

* Borini is a bit of a dick for turning down a £14m move to Sunderland in 2014.

Benteke wins the Golden Boot scoring 30+ goals. Coutinho takes another huge step forward and regularly scores 35 yard screamers. Coutinho and Firmino work together beautifully; feeding Benteke, creating for others and calling there own number regularly. Lallana fulfills his potential and becomes another key attacking player. Jordan Ibe blossoms before our eyes into a world class winger. Raheem who? The combination of Henderson and Milner lock down the midfield like two cogs working in perfect harmony. Our defense is a steel curtain, helping Mignolet lead the Prem in clean sheets. It doesn't matter who the CB pairing is. Skrtel-Sakho or Skrtel-Lovren. Heck, even Lovren-Sakho can't be beaten. Joe Gomez proves his preseason hype was not unworthy, becoming one of the best, young LB in the league and pairs well with Clyne, who is a rock on the right side. Markovic, Ings and Can are absolute game changers off the bench. They are what we like to call ""super subs"". Sturridge comes back in September and completes an injury free season, proving he is a world class striker along the way.

I'm not sure that's proven with this game since we only saw 13 outfield players. Rose and Pritchard weren't played, but we can't know how he feels about Carroll, for instance.

I think the lack of depth has yet to be exposed in the sense that we saw our play flatten due to fatigue (since it's only the first fixture of the season). I like the critique, but you're missing the point of what my post is about: I agree that we need more transfers in, but I disagree that today's match indicates that.

If so, that's nothing to do with London per se - mortgages are taken out to purchase properties pretty much everywhere, whether a £1m property in Central London or a £150k house in Stirling. That's just reasonable - a house is very expensive, and it is easier to, and makes sense to, borrow money to buy it and then repay that, instead of saving until you have the whole sum saved.

Or is your problem actually the prices vs the supposed 'normal worker's' salary? That is a much more complicated question, but really, the answer to how anyone affords it is - by getting a well enough paid job (hence why a lot of people buying are older, so they're further in their careers and earn more). It has to be understood that there's a limited number of properties in the very centre (you said within Zone 2) of one of the most desirable cities in the whole world (which you also require to be modern).

&gt;A 1-0 loss against an average United team, where we did look slow and and lacked invention, is not particularly good

Smalling and Darmian had really good performances. Yes we lacked some killer creativity but that doesn't take away that they as well as Blind played a good game at the back for Utd.

&gt;that wasn't a performance that screams top 4

It's the first. game. of. the. season. We have time to improve and take many more wins that aren't away at Old Trafford which if you haven't heard is one of the rarest wins in our entire history, despite relative success a couple seasons ago.

&gt;New signings do lead to less mistakes, as theyre better players. 

We made 1 mistake that cost us from a 20 year old player. And good players make mistakes too.

&gt;A natural center defensive mid would be far better than Dier.

Possibly but Dier was actually really good today so that is somewhat irrelevant based on today.

&gt;The opinions are also my own I cant change them

I'm aware we are unable to change our opinions (unless we receive new information to prove otherwise) but that doesn't mean they are unique or worth sharing. Maybe before posting/sharing your article give a read to the comments of the match/post-match thread and you will realize that 90% of what you have to say has been said.

null,null,Vulgar_Slaughter,dundeefc,,null,"Was always going to struggle to live up to the billing, but what I saw in that match was thoroughly disappointing on so many levels. 

First half was all Dundee as Hearts played a very very physical game (the likes of which I haven't seen since we left the championship to be honest) and we struggled to do anything with the chances we got. Both teams missed multiple chances, but Dundee could have been 3 or 4 up.

Second half was a completely different game though, Hearts came out all guns blazing looking for the goals and our players just switched off and were anonymous. Dee players were losing their heads at Hearts' constant time wasting that started within seconds of their second goal went in and started putting in stupid tackles and losing the ball far too easily. Hartley made zero changes despite the fact that we were completely lost the entire second half.

Craig Thomson refereeing a game at dens, enough said. He clearly hates us and I have no idea how he gets to ruin our games with impunity time and time again.

All in all, fair play to hearts they ground out a win in a game that covered neither team in glory.

Swansea is pressing us really hard all over the pitch but after 20 minutes, they couldnt keep up the pressing and we are now having a good spell.  I can see us getting more chances now we are getting more possession.  And whilst typing this we scored a goal!  Get in Oscar.

To be fair they have had the better chances before the goal.  Their striker Gomis has been a handful and if he had taken his chances they could have gone ahead.  We should have had a pen right after but the ref seems to be giving swansea everything so far.  Throwins, free kicks etc.

Oscar has been the best player for me so far.  Him and Matic.  Hazard and Willian seems quiet.

Damn they scored whilst typing.  That Gomis is giving us problems with his movement and he was the one with the assist.

However we don't want to get into the situation where we are paying out an unsustainable amount of subsidies on any particular one technology, so when the DECC says:

&gt; The Government does not earmark budget for any specific technology. Instead, the Government wishes to develop a mixture of renewable energy technologies.

This worries me somewhat. Either the answer is a fudge because they don't really want to say, or we have an inadequate system in place for budgeting renewable energy technologies, because without a clear understanding of the expense and profitability of various ventures I fail to see how we can develop a coherent renewable energy strategy for the future. Maybe it is possible to do so without a specifically demarcated budget, but I certainly can't see it making the task any easier, and it is already a very contentious policy issue.

a sidenote is that, whilst I have no way of verifying the numbers cited from data provided by the Renewable Energy Foundation and I will accept them in good faith as accurate, the organization has [come under criticism before for having an 'anti-wind agenda'](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/may/18/renewable-energy-foundation-wind-farm) - now I'm not entirely certain myself whether these criticisms are legitimate but it's worth bearing in mind.",null,0,null,1439053683,null,null,1439054497,0,ctw1la9,null,t3_3g9ai9,null,null,null,t3_3g9ai9,null,null,null,1440359873,null,4,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,4,null

null,null,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"I do think the match is an indication of our need for signings, not because one match, least of all the first match of the season, tells the entire story of a team, but because there were some very telling signs that I think were present all throughout last season that can be extrapolated to this one.  They are:

- No backup for Kane or Eriksen.  Not that either particularly needed to come off today, but neither were on point either, and could've used an additional body.

- No decent attacking options to change things up.  When your attacking subs when chasing the game are Lamela (who I don't think will ever be good enough to single-handed my turn a big match like this), a 19 year old making his debut and Mason (a player of limited abilities as evidenced last season), you know we're light in personnel up front.  There was literally no one on the bench who was an effective outlet.

- We played a 21 year old CB in midfield.  That alone screams ""make a signing"".  Not because Dier is worthless or can't eventually grow into the role, but it's patently not what we signed him for, and robs our actual CB position of rotational depth.  Playing him there is obviously a desperate move by Poch to fit a square peg in a round hole that has existed since the beginning of last season.  The fact we still haven't solved it is kinda embarrassing actually.

- General lack of pace on the pitch.  You can see how beautiful Toby's raking diagonal balls are... can you imagine if we had a wide player like Lennon at his best able to burst into space and latch onto them?  Chadli, despite being pretty good this match, and goddamn Dembele are never ever going to beat a man for pace, and that just further limits out attacking options and makes us increasingly one-dimensional.


We were definitely better than I expected us to be and unlucky to not get a point, but even three points here wouldn't have changed the bleeding obvious that there's no way we can go a full season playing on four fronts with the squad we have and expect to do ok.",null,0,null,1439054065,null,null,false,0,ctw1scx,null,t3_3g8xp4,null,null,null,t3_3g8xp4,null,null,null,1440359965,null,14,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,14,null

But if you want more than 2 minutes of thrills and you're handy for the m40/m4 I can highly recommend the A40 between West Wycombe and Milton Common and the A4 between Redding and Marlborough.

you also seem to be unable to grasp why Labour lost in May: here's a protip for you, it's not for the reason you seem to think it is. They lost ground to the SNP for being too far to the right, with that taken into account, counting every SNP seat as a Labour one, it was not a huge margin at all (23 seats, iirc?)

Fact of the matter is, Tory or Labour, British politics has always been in the centre, with some things borrowed from the left and some things borrowed from the right, the thing about FPTP is it draws party policies toward a middle ground.

Up until the 1970s it was common for wealthy people to keep leopards and panthers as pets. Was trendy for many famous people to do so. 

Laws came out that required people to have licences and keep them in zoo like enviroments. 

Many of the folks keeping them were not that responsible and it seems likly that some were just released. 

Leopards tend to be hard to spot in the wild. They live right near human communities and naturally keep themselves secluded and hidden. 

We have a food source within our countyside that could support a small population. Rabbits etc are how they feed in the wild. 

The only thing that makes it less likely is lack of bones from dead leopards etc. After 45 years a few should have been found by now.

So very possible. But little true evidence. ",null,0,null,1439054832,null,null,false,0,ctw26gm,null,t3_3g8d70,null,null,null,t3_3g8d70,null,null,null,1440360151,null,3,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

But why can't we?  It's not like anyone's expecting we'll sign Griezmann or Lacazette... I mean, Chadli and Eriksen hardly broke the bank and yet both have become first team mainstays.  If pretty much every team both above and below us bar Chelsea can strengthen their first team in the summer, we need to be able to as well.  And considering our first XI isn't exactly full of world-beaters, I fail to see how it can't be improved, even just by landing 1-2 of the targets we've been linked with incessantly over the last few weeks.

And on Alli, I have incredibly high hopes for him, but we don't want to end up in the same situation as Mason did last season... overplayed and overburdened for a young player with the responsibility of playing every match and running midfield largely by himself.  He needs to be eased into the side and given plenty of refreshers on the bench.  Heck, even Bentaleb, one of our standouts from last season, showed he's not infallible today.  In all the talk about buying an extra CM, I don't think anyone seriously considered what we would do should Bentleb have a rough patch of form or pick up an injury, which makes the situation more alarming then previously thought.",null,0,null,1439055258,null,null,false,0,ctw2ehn,null,t3_3g8xp4,null,null,null,t1_ctw1zrg,null,null,null,1440360256,null,3,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

null,null,northern_crusader,null,null,null,"&gt; I was just wondering how can normal people afford to purchase any flat in London? 

The clue is in your post:

&gt; I can't find anything modern, in Zone 2

You have to compromise.

&gt; Who is buying those flats? The ugly ones. I'm not talking about the shiny towers with prices starting in £899k or £1m. Is it normal people?

Normal people who are willing to compromise. In the past that is what people used to do and some of those areas are now very expensive with those who were willing to compromise when the area was shitty reaping the rewards.

&gt; So to me, having to put let's say £60k deposit against a £300k flat (given I could manage to find one!) is borderline. The rest would be a ridiculously huge mortgage regardless of the low interest rates. That's just not YOUR MONEY, it is BANK's MONEY. It is a huge debt just to live in 485ft.

The vast majority of homes throughout the entire UK are bought with mortgages. I cannot see why you have an issue with this. 

&gt; Everything in London so far seems cheap to me.

You've never been out of London have you? 

The only reason you've not got somewhere is because of the barriers you yourself are erecting to prevent you from buying. You have a strict criteria and don't want to buy with a mortgage.

I didn't mind Dier in mid, but I think whoever the other midfielder is (Bentaleb most likely, but didn't mind alli at the end) needs to be the one to move the ball into positions where the forward players can actually do something. Too often it seems we get a little bit forward, don't see a clear cut opening, and go back, often too far backwards. Kane can do amazing things, but you have to give him the chance. 

Should have seen lamela earlier. Didn't really have a problem with dembele but as soon as we conceded there needed to be someone to have a go at the defenders. 

But as has been the case for a while, we lack that one incisive pass that opens things up in the front, just not good enough off ball movement from forward players. Too often a player receives the ball out wide, and there are inside players who can come to him to receive a pass but they just stand there waiting for the wide player to do something, and then the wide player goes backward.

Otherwise he'd just be Depay, or Memphis Depay. 

You're insisting I'm a xenophobe (I assume because you've got nothing better to do or you're just a condescending douchebag who gets a good kick out of it) and I'm having to justify myself in an issue that wouldn't exist unless you created it.

No.  Just that you are ignorant and that ignorance is xenophobic.  There is absolutely no reason for you to hold these views.  They don't reflect on how the game is played.  They don't reflect a players skill.  You just have some personal vendetta because you think people are just wanting to make a name for themselves?  You still have yet to say if **EVERY SINGLE** Brazilian or Portuguese player that used their first name is just trying to make a name for themsleves?  Was Pele?  Socrates?  Cafu?  Roberto Carlos?  Eder?  Gervinho?  Eusebio?  Juninho?  Your viewpoint is just not logical, and you cherry-picked a few examples that STILL don't work.  People go by nicknames it is not [necessarily] a reflection on them wanting to be special.

&gt; You're creating an issue that wouldn't exist unless you bring it up and force the issue, like a player (Memphis Depay) insisting that he have his own name on his shirt and the media refer to him simply as 'Memphis'. Otherwise he'd just be Depay, or Memphis Depay. 

In my first comment I said why he did this...  and it seems a bit insensitive and pompous for you to suggest his intentions as anything other than what he has said.

&gt; I'm having to justify myself in an issue that wouldn't exist unless you created it. 

Aren't you the one creating the issue?  The world has no problem with names on shirts, but you do?  Because you think it means they just want attention?  The world actually has no problem with people referring to be called one thing or another!

You can call me a douchebag as much as you want, and yeah, I am being condescending, because you have shown time and again through this entire conversation an unwillingness to accept a viewpoint other than your own, a CULTURE other than your own.

In that scenario it makes much more sense to play a specialist defensive midfielder and a specialist box-to-box because they'll both be 100% suited to their jobs both in and off the ball - Lucas is a better distributor from deep than JH or JM as well as being much better defensively. The henderson/milner switching thing only gets the best out of each player half the time.

For me the only way the no specialist DM thing makes sense is if we really do go all out attack and a  high press, with no one protecting the defense, on the basis that the amount of ball we win high up the pitch and players supporting the attack will exceed the number of times the we lose the ball or the press gets broken and they're running at our defence.

However I don't find that there is a ""Need"" to increase ticket prices. Many many many many stadiums and sports teams across the globe are able to find other ways to cut the budget, keep ticket prices at an ok cost, and still remain EXTREMELY profitable. 

For the sake of argument say the average ticket price for a liverpool home game is 50 pounds. I know tickets are more expensive and less but just say that's the average ticket price. It's probably cheaper but whatever. They play 19 premier league home games, and let's just say 8 per season from any other competition. At 45,522 seats they make 2.27 million pounds every game just on ticket prices. Round down to 2 million if you want for season ticket holders or whatever. Multiplied by 27 home games 61.45 million pounds in a season.

Look at their financial situation broken down http://www.forbes.com/teams/liverpool/

I don't believe in the fact that there is a NEED to increase ticket prices. I'm very confident in making other sponsorship deals, or vender deals to cut costs and bring in more revenue.

- Over-reliance on Hazard’s brilliance - when he has a less-than-impressive game (as it was today) we suffer.

- Awful corners. We need someone who can consistently put the ball into a dangerous area on a cross - something we have missed since Mata left.

- Also, Willian needs to stop bringing the entire play to a halt, or at least do it less often. It isn’t effective. It let’s their defense completely reset, and we lose all momentum.

I have a couple more questions if you don't mind answering!

1) Do people generally use the college cafeteria for food? Can I ask how much are meals?

2) What is the location like in regards to the law faculty/shopping?

3) How have you found staying at Wolfson? What do you like and dislike about it? To be honest, I didn't choose Wolfson - but from what I've heard it seems like a very friendly, laidback college and I'm really looking forward to it.

4) Are the graduates generally of an older demographic? I've just turned 21 myself.

null,null,Anandya,null,null,null,"Small problem here. Have you actually met any Asylum Seekers? Most have to live in registered government centres so cannot integrate (they cannot leave). 

Here is the thing. You are ignoring a lot of the history and ease by which Polish and mainly white immigrants are welcomed. Put it this way? In the 90s there were families who told their kids not to ""play with that paki kid (aka Me)"". My parents had to deal with violence against Asians in the 70's and 80's. Southall for example is the way it is because it was where Hindus banded together to fight racists. It was mainly Hindus who lead the fight because they had the most monetary muscle (Business owners, Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers). 

When I grew up in the 80s and 90s I faced racism. Like ""proper"" racism. Parents wouldn't want their kids to play with me (Honestly? If I was white I would be the kid your parents wanted you to play with. Good grades, never got in trouble, liked sport, was polite). I was told that I was poisoning other kids with my ""food"". Now you may say ""this was an immigrant area"" but this was freaking Scotland. White as white can be. We moved to Moss Side, Manchester because THAT was better than Glasgow in the early 90s. 

I have been held down and force fed bacon to send me to hell (won't work, was a Hindu and was a vegetarian at the time. Sadly, I still hate bacon due to that). I have had parents call me nigger and paki when I came to pick up my dates. I have had things thrown at me. I have been abused on buses and trains. And I have been abused recently. Like 2 years ago. 

I am not an immigrant. I am British. This is what I endured as a Brit. Now imagine what other Asians have endured. Maybe London would be better. The world's changed for the better but you cannot ignore those insults of my youth and expect others like me to have my sunny disposition. 

My parents found Asian friends for me when I was younger, to spare me the insults and violence. My parents encouraged me to stay away because they knew I would be a target. They grew up when being force fed meat was a minor inconvenience. Being stabbed was more common. Look up the Southall protests and the deaths of people fighting the National Front. 

Now here is the thing. My parents didn't see why they should ignore their own culture and give me a white guy name. They didn't see why we should eat bland British food. Honestly? We may eat turkey at Christmas but it's Tandoori Turkey more than Roasted. We didn't see why I should be given the same leeway with regards to education (In that education always came first. Not many kids out of Moss Side get an education). 

See the thing is? Being pretty outcast as a kid made me realise why Muslims and all those ""bad immigrants"" are sidelined. There is a limit to the tolerance for this kind of treatment. My friends were equally outcast. Nerds and the weak and the geeks. 

Ungrateful? You do realise my entire family has lost entire generations fighting for the Empire? That in terms of service that not one generation of my family over the past 100 years hasn't done something to help the UK? My ancestors didn't even get a proper cremation during WW I, most of my grandparents families died in WW II. My parents were in the foreign service as embassy doctors for British workers in the Middle East. I work in India for a charity representing the UK.

Both Chelsea goals were strokes of luck, one being Ayew's injury and Gomis' subsequent foul then the deflection was just absurd. I'm upset to see how much we deflated after Montero went off though. Great result, if we play like that every game we finish top 8 again.

**Positives:**

- Every part of Gomis' game apart from finishing

- Shelvey looking like Pirlo at times

- Montero trying his hardest to tear Ivanovic's ACL, had him on skates

- Fernandez was incredible

- Ayew. The work rate, the flair, the final product. Loved it.

- Fabianski. We lose that game with Vorm in net. Fab commands his area so bravely.

- The Defence. No Chelsea player scored in open play. 

- Making Costa whine like a child multiple times


**Negatives:**

- Gomis' finishing. He played well, but the final product still looks shaky

- Siggy. Absent until the red card. I think Matic simply marked him out of the game, lets hope he gets into form.

- Communication on counters. We ruined a few key counters at the end by simply failing to communicate. While Shelvey to Gomis was as dangerous as ever on the counter, we had trouble forming more complex attacks.

- Routledge. Now I'm being cruel here, but the drop off between Montero and Routledge was ridiculous. Ayew even shifted over to attack on the left to compensate for Montero's abscence.

Which is a little worrying (see that pessimism I was talking about?!) but seriously, I think we're now seen as an ""established"" premier league team... Which is something I'd never think I'd see myself saying 10 years ago, hell even 5 years ago.

Rundown of the squad? Here's the highlights, imo;

Fabianski was seen as a bit of a misfit after he left Arsenal but promptly shown them up with a great season. Great, confident, safe keeper.

Ashley Williams is a rock hard bastard and in my opinion the best centre back outside of the top 4. Also captain of Wales.

Jonjo Shelvey is a liability... But when he pulls it off, it's incredible (I.e. 60 yard passes made easy, goals from the half way line, thunderbastards from 30 yards out, the lot). He'll almost always pick up a yellow card too, standard hot head.

Gylfi Sigurdsson, my favourite player, is a game changer. Deadly at set pieces, can pick out passes for days and has a great shot on him.

Jefferson Montero is probably our most exciting winger. Quick, good feet, and creative. Often tears full backs apart (just ask Branislav Ivanovic after his performance today)

Andre Ayew is definitely our most exciting signing. Strong, intelligent, knows where the goal is. Looks like he's perfect for the more physical style of play you'll find in the Premier League (a cliche I know, but he seems to be fitting right in based on his performance today)

Matt Grimes is our ""one to watch"" imo. Signed from Exeter last season, he had a good pre season and seems to be fitting into our style of play like a duck to water. Can see him getting off the bench a good few times and will be a consistent cup game starter too I reckon.

No. That's not how science works. You can't claim there might be secret long term effects that we didn't notice in the 73 years since they've been running.

From your first sentence I don't think you understand the point of my comment. 

My comment wasn't *about* asylum seekers it was in-regard to Bulgarians and Romanians, AKA Eastern Europeans, which the comment I was replying to was about.

Again, my comment was about Eastern Europeans, they're not asylum seekers (maybe a tiny handful are), so my comment was asking what do they mean when they say:

&gt;They've moved onto Romanians/Bulgarians.

Them to me are in the same group as the Polish, hard workers who come here to have a better life. 


I then go on about assimilating, as a point why people may have animosity towards people, and that it doesn't matter *where* you're from its *how* you act once you're here, which for some is hard. 

This doesn't change the fact though, that the vast majority of people who come here from Asia, Africa or Europe, don't make much effort to fit in.

Hi,
I'm looking for a cheap macbook, not looking to spend much more than £100 (unlikely, I know), I really don't mind how old it is or what kind of condition it's in.

Thanks

In the case of renewals, if there are two servers on the network, there is a race between one server acknowledging a renewal and the other rejecting it. This has the potential to cause unreliable networking as clients are forced to go through discovery again and potentially change IP address, upon receiving a different lease from the other server.

If you're really unlucky, the race could reliably flap between each server winning, so that the client is forced every few hours to switch IP address

Finally of course, if both DHCP servers are configured to allocate addresses from the same range things are going to break much more quickly",null,0,null,1439061467,null,null,false,0,ctw5nrr,null,t3_3g8h74,null,null,null,t1_ctvwhgh,null,null,null,1440361791,null,1,null,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

I understand why he'd want to play every week but we should either get him to sign a new contract and let him go on loan or keep him. We have no reason to sell him. 

Here's how I see it. 

If we sold him now we'd gone almost nothing, he's too young, past year of contract and the club's involved are French so don't have money. 

So we could sell him for almost nothing. 

OR 

We could keep hold of him, play him a decent amount and persuade him that he's got a future here. Pellegrini likes 2 players for every position - Sterling-Silva-KDB, backed up by Nasri-Navas-Lopes. He should get enough games over the season to keep him here - and he's at least get a chance to show if he's good enough to demand a bigger role.

I repeat. You tell me how I should have acted growing up? Give up the food? I did that. After the first time my parents put potato curry into sandwiches and I got made fun of. The language? None of my friends ever realised I spoke Tamil. 

If your response to mine is TL:DR then you will never realise why people come here feel unwelcome and make out a living in places where other people are like them. 

Oh and FYI? I have been to both Poland and Iraq. Trust me, Rusholme is nothing like India or Bangladesh or Pakistan. I have been to both and the only thing in common are the Supermarkets for Asian food, the few sweet shops and the jewellery stores. We don't eat in Rusholme... 

I mean if I want curry, I go to Anand's Cash and Carry in Manchester. If I want like traditional food it's Chennai Dosa in Stretford. 

What you think is ""our locales"" often aren't. 

The fact you couldn't even bother to read the dialogue from someone whose family has been in the UK for more than 3 generations you may learn something. 

I didn't come here. I was born here. My mum was born here. My grandmother was born in London. Great grandfather died at Ypres. My Grandparents both fought in Burma. 

Now the problem is how we were treated. My grandparents were little more than property. My parents fought for equality. I fought because not fighting would have got me beaten up or hell killed. 

When racists attack Asians it's a throwback to my childhood. It's every single fear my parents have had. My parents didn't want me going clubbing not because I would meet some girl but because some cunt would have tried to take a swing at me. 

TL:DR sums up the damn problem. Perhaps if you listened to the immigrants you may learn how they are treated and why they live like that. Hint. Southall was basically where the richer Asians fought back against the National Front. The ignorant white nationalists ran head first into soldiers, businessmen, engineers and doctors.

It's not as simple as people make out to 'just scale up' a business. Adding 30% more sales might mean they need new staff/equipment/premises, it's more expensive and time consuming than people think to go from a small family-run or 1/2 person business to a business that employees staff. Then you've got to add that cost to the £1300 odd upfront cost, and  remember that this extra revenue won't be as profitable as your current revenue (-12% commission). 

These takeaways really are working on fine margins, not all of them can afford to give up this amount of money upfront (loans aren't as freely available as the governments PR department makes people think), or take a hit of 12% on the new revenue, especially if more customers start ordering on Just Eat instead of by phone. 

From a socialist perspective I'd also say what if they're happy with their current situation in terms of work/life balance, and [quote the mexican fisherman story](http://bemorewithless.com/the-story-of-the-mexican-fisherman/), but that's a completely different story. 


&gt;Also some of this cost will pass to the customer in the form of higher prices

Not sure about that, the prices are similar for local ones near me. 

I like the idea of Just-eat, but they are ripping off the takeaways because they can get away with it. They'll become a massive corporation while takeaways are struggling.

if you don't like the sound of a mortgage, fair play, but there is a difference between achieving mortgage-free status and starting out that way. i can't think of a single one of my peers who has (or can) buy a property outright in their neighbourhood. for 99% of our generation, the mortgage is the only way to achieve this. 

you may see the mortgage and owned house as a financial noose around your neck, and i have some sympathy for that - it isn't easy to just up sticks and move. but that says more about your life view than the financial aspect.  in my case, i have a stable job, as does my wife, and family/friends in the area. I also have a child who goes to a local nursery that we know well and will soon be enrolled in a local school.  i own my house (with a mortgage) because i prefer the risk that comes with debt (risk of me defaulting, risk of changing interest rates) over the risk that rent becomes unaffordable and i have to take my daughter out of school and move away. if we moved, our commutes would be longer, and i could quite easily lose my job because i wouldn't get to work on time (though that is an unusual situation).  by owning my house i have more control over the situation. not that one of us is right/wrong here, i just suspect you have different priorities.

some day you may feel differently, or you may not. keep on renting as long as you value the upsides to it more than the downsides.

It's obviously a tactical decision by Mourinho to have Ivanovic playing how he does, but I don't think it's wrong to question the merit of whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Is Ivanovic regularly bringing enough going forward to make up for how it makes us vulnerable down that side of the pitch? Should also be noted that it's the side of the pitch that generally has Fabregas covering rather than Matic.

I disagree. France is doing perfectly well with their nuclear power.

Moreover, if you look [here](https://orderorder.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/energy.jpg) you'll see that France has the cheapest energy for consumers in all of western Europe, so the government would benefit from businesses having lower expenditures and higher revenue, especially energy intensive ones like steel production.

I do not care, I don't take an emotional empathy route to immigration anymore, its died in me. I don't care where you've been, or where you're from, I only care about how you act now you're *here*.  

Also:

&gt;I didn't come here. I was born here. My mum was born here. My grandmother was born in London. Great grandfather died at Ypres. My Grandparents both fought in Burma.

You're not an immigrant.... you're not who me, or anyone else who talks about immigration is talking about. If anything you're like my friend I spoke about, you're hear and you've fit in, you are irrelevant to what I'm talking about. 

I'm on about those who move here, then go straight to the places where every shop has signs in Arabic, or Polish, and you can walk for hours and miles never hearing an English word spoken. Where the houses look like shit, which sounds harsh, but its reality, and I mean where entire neighborhoods go down the drain. As frankly, a lot of immigrants (mainly Muslim/Middle Eastern) seem to have no respect, at least for the outside, of their homes and streets as a whole. Where white/Western European people move away because they get harassed, and feel unsafe and because their property's price has plummeted. 90% of London boroughs are now 70%+ majority foreign born or first gen immigrants, where ""white British"" is the minority, London from the 2011 census is only 40% ""British"".

I'm on about the culture that they refuse to let go of, the reality of what I see everyday on my way to work. The people who make no effort to fit in, who move to those areas by choice and by choice don't try to assimilate. The fact you aren't one of these makes it annoying that you're trying to shoe horn in and speak for them, when all you're doing is mumbling on about some wars, and where you're from/been, it doesn't matter. 

I use to be someone who cared, who felt sorry for everyone, who admired and welcomed anyone who wanted to come here, but they've ruined it themselves for me. They don't seem grateful, they come here and make no effort to fit in to the country which has taken them in.

And remember. I lived in Moss Side. Poverty is a bigger problem, not the immigrants. Poor white people also do the same thing. It's just that poor white people still have more upward mobility and more opportunities. 

Oh and you only consider me integrated because I am productive. If I was unemployed you would probably lump me in with the whole ""the place is terrible due to this guy"". 

I repeat. For all my willingness to participate, I was shunned. I had a choice. I either spend time with a lot of Asians (and I do have way more Asian friends) or I be alone. I luckily found other people who aren't ""all that British"" despite being white to hang out with.

First thing to do is make sure you're on the electoral roll as you will not get credit without being on it. Pull your credit reports from the 3 CRA's (Experian, Equifax and CallCredit).

You can get your Equifax report monthly via ClearScore and your CallCredit report monthly via Noddle for free. You'll have to pay £2 for Experian. Check all three and make sure no errors exist (late payments, financial associations, electoral roll, etc).

When you're satisfied with your credit reports try the [MSE Credit Card Eligibility Checker](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/eligibility/credit-cards/) to see what cards you're likely to be accepted for. Capital One and BarclayCard also offer an eligibility check so you won't have to do a hard pull (check for credit that will show on your credit report).

You will have the tax free allowance of £10,600 this tax year and will be charged 20% on top of this as well as 12% National Insurance (there is also a tax free allowance for National Insurance but I forget what it is - around £7k I think?). You will be taxed each month and these tax-free allowances will be taken into account.

Any benefits-in-kind, dental etc. are added to your taxable pay and you will be taxed on this the usual way, for example, if they come to £500, your taxable salary will be £18,000 (National Insurance will also be calculated using this £18k).

1. Have sufficient 'float' in the account to smooth over the outgoing payments. Ignore the lost interest; it's likely not very much in absolute terms, so do the sums to figure out exactly how many £s you're chasing before you decide how much effort to sink into pursuing an improvement.

2. Make regular transfers (by standing order) into the account, matching the next expected outgoings and scheduled to keep the balance topped up sufficiently. Include some safety margin in terms of amount in the account and days between the transfer and the outgoing payment, in case of delays or any change in the DD amounts.

3. Pay your bills from an account that pays interest.

null,null,northern_crusader,null,null,null,"Is the wrong answer. They will pay nothing in tax because by whatever week or month in the tax year that month's pay is, the gross pay up to that date isn't enough to have met the annual allowance allocation for that date.

Say that we're in month 5 and the OP gets their first wage slip for £2500. The annual personal allowance works out at £833 a month so by month 5 you've accrued £4416 of tax free money. Now even though the £2500 pay that month is above the monthly limit of £10,600/12 then because they've earned nothing to date they're below the £4416 cumulative total for month 5 so pay no tax. The following month the cumulative total tax free goes up to £5249. Again they get paid £2500 but again they'll pay no tax because they've now only earned £5000 to date. Month 7 the cumulative total of personal allowance goes up to £6082. They get £2500 pay so their gross pay for tax to date is now £7500 which takes them over the cumulative totall so they'll pay 20% on £7500-£6082. Now everything has caught up so in month 8 they'll pay 20% on everything over £833 they get paid that month.

In the next tax year they will pay tax on everything above £833 a month from the first pay cheque because the counter is reset and the income per month is above the sum total of tax free allowance up to that pay date. Assuming they don't earn anything else taking them over the tax free allowance then they'll have to reclaim the overpaid tax.

The paper that literally said ""vote Labour"" on election day is going to be totally fair and biased when discussing the other party, right?

&gt; REALITY: Two flagship electrification plans which take in Derby, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield were scrapped soon after the election.

Jesus wept. It's not some anti-North thing, it's because the electrification to Bristol and South Wales (not the south west, really) has already started and needs to be complete in time for the arrival of the new trains. The electrification of the other lines had not really started and does not have new trains waiting for it. So when Network Rail realised they bit off more than they could chew, those projects are the ones put on ice (not scrapped).

It also happens to be the first extension of electrification into the south west, whereas electrification went up north (and into places like Manchester) like 50 years ago

Still, if Labour actually did some electrification during their 13 years in power we might not have had the issue at all - we'd have the skills and the equipment to plan and build this stuff, rather than dealing with inexperience and having to tool up practically from scratch. At least the coalition and current governments have tried to do something about it.",null,1,null,1439067124,null,null,1439067419,0,ctw8izy,null,t3_3g8dsb,null,null,null,t3_3g8dsb,null,null,null,1440363207,null,-1,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,-1,null

We don't actually desperately need anyone and hopefully our younger kids can step it up.  You talked like we just avoided relegation last season instead of winning it.

Mourinho always like to have a smaller squad.  I guess you won't know that being when you just start following football recently.  He has won titles across Europe with that style so no need to slit your wrist over it.

Utd did have it pretty easy against us, as they were happy to sit on their single goal without us creating much save for the final few mins.  I know it's early, but our stagnant attack and soft middle were the overwhelming problems of last season, and they don't appear to have been remedied.

null,null,nicolasbrody,null,null,null,"Thanks for your reply. Let's keep this thing going together!

A) That's definitely true about the UKIP voters I don't disagree. Interestingly enough they don't always view themselves as right wing. I maybe overestimate how many of them he could win back, but I certainly don't think Burnham or Cooper would touch them at all. Liz Kendall might, but like you said she'd lose far too many voters herself. 

B) I certainly don't think social media is representative of the electorate as a whole, but it is representative of young people. I don't think it would be easy but young people seem very attracted to Corbyn, even more then Clegg. I think that he would do very well with them, no idea how he'd do with other demographics of other non-voters though.

C) I think if Labour were trying to keep their core support then it was a terrible effort. They lost a whole nation and loads of other voters they thought they could rely on. My point is that if Labour did target swing voters, I don't think they'd win enough to offset the losses they would probably suffer with this strategy. I also think doing this would do the Conservatives a favour as they would have to implicitly support some Conservative policies to win over swing voters -as evidenced recently people will just go for 'the real thing'. 

D) I think both parties tend to win usually because the time is right I'd agree with that. If Labour wait they will win again, it will just take time. What I mean is having a vision might win over people more quickly and might be better for Labour long term. I also think Corbyn and his popularity is good for politics in England. He's speaking up for views that need to be heard (even if you don't agree with them). Politics is far too centre right at the moment and nobody benefits if a spectrum of allowed opinion is too narrow. Corbyn is also showing how people like someone with principles who answers questions and doesn't have a team telling them what to say - I think politics in this country would benefit from this too. Anyway in terms of adopting your vision, many of Corbyns policies are very very popular and nobody has put them forward for a while, so in a sense he is following public opinion that's been largely ignored for a while (nationalising railways and energy industries, an actual living wage etc). I don't necessarily agree he'd push away centrists and swing voters, but we'll have to wait and see if he wins. 

E) Yeah I think Burnham has messed up his campaign big time. 

F) I have to be honest, because of the wipe out in Scotland and the potential boundary changes, Labour is very unlikely to win a majority regardless.

Hey guys,


Could I get a price check on this cpu with stock cooler ? 

Its brand new and it comes still with the sticker untouched as you can see.Never opened and never used with 2 years warranty.

How much is it worth? RRP: £154 on amazon.co.uk


Would also be interested on a swap for a used led / other computer parts / peripherals :)


Thanks a lot!

Back in the day (1960s and before, I think), Britain used to have open borders with all the other Commonwealth countries. This didn't really present any issues, until large numbers of migrants started arriving from areas like the West Indies and Southern Asia. 

There were discussions over what to do, and many politicians supported keeping open borders with the former white settler colonies (e.g. Canada, Australia, New Zealand), but not the other colonies (e.g. India, Nigeria, countries in the West Indies (despite them also technically being settler colonies, just not white ones)).

The general consensus was that it would be racist to only keep open borders with the white settler colonies, so they completely removed the special privileges Commonwealth citizens received in Britain, be they from Canada, or from India.

The French went from zero to 80% nuclear electricity in the late 70s and 80s and retain cheaper-than-median electricity prices for the EU.  IAEA and IEA projections from that period show nuclear reaching up to something like 40-50% of world primary energy supply (not just electricity) by the millenium

What happened was Three Mile Island, then Chernobyl, and the fact that these accidents were *vastly* overblown in the public consciousness.  The necessary confluence of interests just never emerged to put nuclear back on track.  Those who wanted decarbonisation feared it, and those who liked it were indifferent to its low carbon benefits.  

The world economy also got over the '73 oil price shock.

The cost of nuclear did skyrocket but due to regulatory burdens and failure to make R&amp;D advances mainstream to offset costs with greater profitability.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

So apparently it should all be secured. However, reading the email suggests that my card details among other things were not properly secured.

It appears I've complied with all of their terms and conditions, but they have not kept their end of the bargain to protect that data. Notwithstanding they still expect me to foot the bill for the time and effort required to check my credit file, monitor credit cards and likely put up with even more nuisance telephone calls. 

I am looking forward to seeing how this pans out, given that I've been with their ID network for less than 2 months so far and they have still not sorted their act out and I'm unable to use SMS reliably over 1/2 my received and sent messages disappear without being delivered. Their response to that when I complained about the issue remaining was that they text me to say it was fixed. Hello brain and dangerous!

I also asked for the content lock to be taken off and they still haven't bothered to do that despite promising a call to confirm it was actioned within 5 working days, it's been over 15 at this point. Icing on the cake is that they seem to think all of these issues are only minor inconveniences.

Cannot wait till Thursday when I'll have the time to call their customer services, waiting on hold forever to log yet another complaint with this extra new issue added on to the others I'm 'enjoying'.

-He's cranky and doesn't suffer a fool. For how brilliant the Doctor is, it felt like he tolerated a lot of inanity in the 10/11 years, which is cool, but I liked Pertwee's aggressiveness surrounding what could be painfully stupid questions to the Doctor. Capaldi brought some of that back, and I appreciate it. 

-He's in an old body, but acts young. I wonder if it's because he has a new set of regenerations, or perhaps because he now knows that he made the right decision at the end of the time war, but he acts with the brazen authority of a young man with power and a ethical compass. I like this. 

-His interactions with Clara make him more alive and plausible. He lies to her and hugs her despite the fact that it hides his and her face, even with an ethical compass, he's not above a certain pettiness. 

-He's willing to carry burden he took Missy's laser thing from Clara, so Clara wouldn't kill. I doubt he would have actually killed Missy, I prefer to believe he would have reversed the polarity. But he took the weight of that responsibility from her. 

-He saluted Lethbridge-Stewart. He knows the burden of tough decisions, and he saluted the Brigadier. He. Saluted. The. Brigadier. In Classic Who the Brigadier obviously loved the Doctor and craved his support, and Capaldi gave it to him. Capaldi. Saluted. The Brigadier.
