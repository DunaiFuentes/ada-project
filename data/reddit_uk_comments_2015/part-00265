null,false,OfficePlum,lfc50,,null,"Full article from Tony Barrett on The Times:

Raheem Sterling will not travel to Bangkok for the start of Liverpool’s pre-season tour of Australia and the Far East after Manchester City entered into formal negotiations to sign the winger.

Having received a third offer from City, worth an initial £40 million up front with an additional £4 million in performance related incentives, Liverpool now regard their interest as serious enough to open a dialogue with their Barclays Premier League rivals and allow Sterling to remain on Merseyside while his team-mates travel to Thailand.

During the course of those discussions, it is understood that City have now indicated a willingness to pay £45 million for Sterling as the two clubs edge closer to striking an agreement. Liverpool, who remain interested in Christian Benteke, the Aston Villa forward, have maintained throughout that Sterling will only be allowed to leave on their terms.

But, after several weeks of an increasingly acrimonious stand-off between Sterling and Liverpool, it is now clear that the situation has reached end-game with City moving ever closer to matching the Merseyside club’s £50 million valuation of the England international.

Sterling informed Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, on Monday that he did not wish to participate in the tour and although the club initially blocked that request there has been sufficient progress in the last 48 hours for the 20-year-old to be given leave to miss the opening stage of the trip.

Although Rodgers included the England winger in his 30-man travelling party when it was named at midday yesterday, he has now been told that his presence will not be required as all parties look to reach an agreement that will bring his five-year spell at Anfield to an end.

Sterling will instead train at Melwood, Liverpool’s training ground, alongside the likes of Mario Balotelli, José Enrique and Fabio Borini who have all been left out of the squad having been made surplus to requirements by Rodgers.

City’s determination to sign Sterling will raise Liverpool’s hopes that they can achieve their full £50 million asking price, particularly after last season’s Premier League runners-up missed out on signing Fabian Delph after the midfielder decided to stay at Aston Villa.

Should talks with City break down, though, Liverpool will send Sterling to join up with the rest of his team-mates on the earliest possible flight but the increasing likelihood is that a deal will be done which will bring this summer’s most rancorous transfer saga to an end.",null,0,null,1436699434,null,0,false,0,ct0kpl3,null,t3_3d05s8,null,t1_ct0kpl3,null,t3_3d05s8,null,null,null,1440484143,null,28,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,28,null

He was injury prone after the world cup, now he got a whole summer to relax so if he comes back to old form United can be quite scary! However, i do not think we will see Schweinsteiger at the level we have previously have seen him. He will be good sure, but not world class anymore and they will get 2 decent seasons from him. 

The addition of a class CB and RB is huge for United, as their defence was in shambles last year. 

Compared this to us, we have added a class RB who is top 3 defensively. Who can remove one side of the field that the wingers can attack on. So as long as Moreno can improve, which is a big if. Our defence should be even more improved from last year.

null,false,CarpeCyprinidae,null,null,null,"You sound like my situation as at about 3 years ago - debt was a little less and income a little more  

My solutions.  
1) Balance transfer on the credit card - gave me 18mo @ 0%  
2) I set up an interest paying current account. I moved my rent DD to go from that account and set up a standing orders to fund it from my main account - plus a slight margin.

3) I set up another interest bearing current account, and had my salary paid into it  

4) I set up standing orders so that I receive a quarter of my salary (Into my main current account, the one I use) on the 1st, 8th, 15th and 23rd of each month and I pay a quarter of my rent + 10% to my rent account on the same days  

This means my cash cycle is only ever a week plus a day or two at the end of the month. Makes it much easier to avoid using the credit cards.  The slowly increasing balance of my rent account means if I get a week of short money, I can reduce my weekly rent payment to cover it.  

After a year of this, I started setting up another interest bearing account - every year my finances had been damaged by annual costs of car ownership - the insurance policy and the tax disk. So I started every month paying 1/12th of the expected annual cost into a savings account  

Current situation. Good. £10K total in my various bank accounts and investments, enough to live on for several months, all built up a little at a time by using every opportunity to earn interest while making my cashflow more predictable. As after I had got my cashflow steady so I had the same costs and same income, more or less, every week of the year, I started redirecting every excess into stocks and shares, ETFs and Fundingcircle.",null,0,null,1436699873,null,0,false,0,ct0kt8l,null,t3_3czap4,null,t1_ct0kt8l,null,t3_3czap4,null,null,null,1440484190,null,6,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,6,null

If the report came in as 'car off the road' and nothing else then Police can only act on what information has been provided. This may have even been misinterpreted as simply as 'car parked up at side of the road' it all depends on the amount of information the initial caller provided.

With the amount of stick the police get from the press anyway, nobody, but nobody who works for them, be it officers or civilian call handlers and dispatchers, would ever risk their job by delaying a response to something like this if they had all the information.

What kind of an argument is that? ""They're screwing us over but it's fine because we get to be horrible to kids in the future""?

&gt;I myself only pay 1.5% interest which is lower than any other form of borrowing, and I can save at 3% APR, so I can pay off my student loan at the minimum repayment rate and actually make money on the money I haven't used to pay it off quicker. That's how good for a bargain student loans are.

Which sounds wonderful until you realise that 75% of students going through the current system are never going to be able to pay off their debts. Until I earn almost £30,000, the rate at which my student debt will increase will be greater than the rate at which I pay it back (the £30,000 figure is probably an understatement because by the time I get that, the debt will have become even bigger and hence the annual interest). 

&gt;Although I fully admit I attended before they increased university fees, so I have it easier than students today.

If you are self-employed things are a little different. The state pension currently pays around £115 a week. You won't get it until you are late 60s. https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/overview  This leads onto #2

2. You should put money away for retirement. The later you leave it the harder it gets. There is a pension calculator here https://www.hl.co.uk/pensions/interactive-calculators/pension-calculator it is very basic, but gives you a good idea that you need to put your bum in gear. Depending on your life circumstances and how you waot to invest, you may want a personal pension or a stakeholder pension. I am 26 and currently put away 25%, but I am very lucky in a well paid job. I plan on semi retiring by 50.

3. 6 months in cash, emergency savings. The rest is up to you on what you do between long term savings / pension etc.

4. Anyone can trade, but the stock market is a dangerous game if you buy shares directly. I have made 25-35% in my shares in less than 6 months, but if I chose losers, I could have lost that amount. Funds are a lot less risky (due to diversification, min of 30 different stocks), but you pay a cost to the fund managers (usually 0.75% of managed funds, or 0.3% of passive funds - passive are ones that just follow the stock market, don't try and beat it e.g. FTSE100). The funds I buy I use Charles Stanley Direct (https://www.charles-stanley-direct.co.uk/), they charge 0.25% for their services. If you want me to go into more detail about stock market and investments let me know, I don't want to make this reply massive.


I would suggest you do the following, work out your budget each month and how much you can save. Split this into different pots; House deposit, emergency cash, retirement. However you feel fit, this could be 33%, 33%,33% or 50%, 25%, 25%. 

What I will say is this; you get comfortable with the amount you spend. In the last 6 years my take home pay has gone up 3x. I now would struggle to go back, but I know I survived and lived perfectly fine when I was paid a lot less, but as soon as you get more money you get used to that lifestyle. If you can, any pay rises, don't the whole rise to spend. If say you get a £3k pay rise, say to yourself OK I will put additional £1k in pension, £1k in savings and then the other £1k for additional spending.

The University of Phoenix stadium is the only rolling-pitch stadium I'm familiar with.

It gets super hot in AZ so they don't want an open-air stadium, so they get a dome for game day and still get natural grass and sunshine.

However, we don't have the space for that. There isn't a football pitch-sized plot of emptiness where we can roll a grass field to.

The closest I've ever felt to being needed as a human was when my friend asked me to be Best Man for his wedding. I think that the problem with modern society is that jobs these days are simplified down specifically so that no one person is ""needed"" as that's a weak point in the profit making process, so we all have shitty replaceable jobs, which keeps us in our little box. That's my opinion, but it sounds like you're going through something similar. A lack of being needed for something. 

One thing I would say is that, as a man, your shittiest decade is out of the way. At some point in the next few years, people will suddenly start looking to you as some sort of leader, just because you're a man. It's weird to explain, but people just give you respect. 

It's not like a red carpet to heaven or anything, but you will get more social respect from people - or perhaps less shit from people would be more accurate. You probably do this unconsciously yourself - have a look at a small group of mid 20's men, then a small group of mid 30's men and compare them.

You're saying it was *less effective*, as evidenced by the London riots, floods in the South West, Lee Rigby's killing and Nigel Farage.

I'd be interested in which of those things you think would have happened differently if Cameron had, for example, his current 12 seat majority instead of a coalition.

Turning to your four points:

1. That happens in majority governments, only then the parent blocs are internal to the governing party - i.e. ministers are appointed due to the need to maintain balance between wets and drys, Blairites and Brownites, or Cameroons and hard-liners. One great advantage of the coalition was it made those implicit internal blocs within the government into formal and transparent blocs.

2. Evidence please. The last two coalition governments in Britain were Cameron's, which did all those difficult things I listed above, and Churchill's, which won the Second World War.

3. Again: the 2010-2015 government took a patient and long-term view of things, in the face of considerable opposition that would have been easy to cave in to - e.g. taking serious action to fix the public finances and finally putting university funding on a sustainable long-term path.

4. The Lib Dems got 24% of the vote. Their mandate to push for electoral reform wasn't dramatically different to the Tories' (36%) mandate to push for boundary reform or an EU referendum. Under majority governments, *some* voters get *all* of what they want. Under coalition governments, *most* voters get *most* of what they want.

Because historically it's charged situations like these, where people err on the side of fear and condemn. Hence the comparisons to 70's IRA and 50's Mississippi. Plus a specialist lawyer (who is more of an expert than myself) has taken interest.


&gt; Making IEDS with intent to murder would be my view not a act of conspiracy, perhaps you can give me a justification then why an apparent British national can go to 'study' Arabic in a warzone end up making bombs to blow people up. its neither his place or responsibility, or do you purpose it is down to his religious belief as a sunni?

If it was me, I'd probably go with it not really being my responsibility. But I can understand why he did. His friend was worried about his own family, and he went to see if he could help. On seeing dead people just lying on the street, he felt compelled to do something. Just a human decency/compassion reaction.

I can't really find myself in a situation where I'd have to make this choice. It's just not something we deal with in the UK (unless you're a muslim), we don't really have any 'Meccas' where we're taken to a warzone and could fall foul of terrorism laws.

The only situation would be hypothetical. Say the USA fell into a civil war. The UK gov says, don't get involved, we may charge you with terrorism for just picking up a gun. For those of us with nothing to do with it, it's easy, we don't get involved. But those of us who have family there may feel compelled to go, all the while our fellow countrymen are saying ""go fuck off then and become a gun-toting Yank. You must be mental.""


&gt; Choosing a side in a sectarian war is not murder, as you frame it, at least not for him. see I have a problem with this, you almost give it tacit approval, perhaps you give me your view then, using the same analogy in a hypothetical situation. if a paramilitary version of EDL or some-such started bombing Mosque's in Mainland UK in retaliation for murders committed by Islamist fanatics, by your apparent view it'd be justified then?

I'm not sure that your analogy is the same. A more accurate one would be if the Islamic Facists where attacking EDL strongholds and murdering civilians, I would understand why the EDL may build IEDs to protect themselves.

In an ideal world, no-one would blow up anyone. But once the cat's out of the bag violence begets violence.


&gt; but you have to admit that your arguments are slanted against him of course they are.. he's been found guilty by trial and the evidence presents he was involved in terrorist activity, I don't care if he planning to blow up Noddy and Bigears, murder is murder, he had no right, no justification for being involved, even his own apparent 'religion' would condemn it, why do you find it hard to do so?

Here's where I think the framing is different. Killing someone isn't necessarily murder. And even within murder, it isn't binary. Bring it home a little. Would you kill someone to protect your children? If so, is that murder?


&gt; *I think it just adds to the Islamaphobia which is sweeping our country* There is valid and evident reason why public opinion is turning against muslims, I pity the muslims in the UK that are non-sunni's, as it is sectarian/extremism in the sunni category that is responsible for the current cultural and demographic problems this nation is facing

I don't think it's valid to tar all of Islam for the actions of the few. I don't think that's valid AT ALL. It's much more complicated than that.

I'm waiting to hear back from a law firm about starting as a trainee. I did a law degree, but a quarter of the other interviewees hadn't, and neither had several of the trainees working there.

The firm would pay for their law conversion and professional diploma. 2 more years of study, and £18,000 of fees. But they really didn't want a firm full of law graduates.

To be clear I'm saying cherry picking events that have occurred in the last five years is not an accurate measure of government's effectiveness, because we are arguing in hypotheticals and hypothetically speaking it is entirely possible a majority government could have achieved all of those positives without any of the negatives

1. That is your opinion. I would say a minister being selected based on qualifications, character and experience is more important than ""highlighting internal blocs""

2. There are other countries who've had coalition governments. Unless you don't think it's worthwhile to learn from other political systems? Perhaps the fact the UK had only tried a coalition government twice should be a warning.

3. Evidence please. This sounds like entirely your opinion. There is tonnes of criticism of how the Lib-Con pact handled the economy, and for you to ignore it seems as absurd as denying the existence of the sun.

4. 'I think the latter is preferable.' Exactly, you 'think', as you're entitled to, because it's an opinion. Conversely I don't think it's preferable that parties with a lower vote count should be blackmail others to fit their agenda, and it seems like just the sort of corruption you were keen to eradicate in your rebuttal to my first point

The car was 299 (call it 300) a month for 3 years, and at the end of that you had the option to pay the remaining off as a lump sum and keep the vehicle (about 7k). It was a 0% APR deal, but still it doesn't work out that great financially.

After a year and a bit we sold it back to the dealership, and took a couple grand hit (had to pay that amount in to make up the difference), and then took out a loan with our bank and bought a second hand vehicle for around 8k instead that had pretty low mileage and wasn't too old (45k miles on the clock). Now we pay a smaller amount back each month and have a reliable second hand VW Passat with all the features we need (leather heated seats, cruise control, lots of comfort etc...).

I calculated that doing this would after the original 3 years since first getting the Mazda Mx-5 would still be better for us financially, even with taking the 2k hit after selling the Mazda back to the dealership.

I won't ever recommend (financially speaking) getting a brand new car now. I'd much rather take something a few years old with low mileage and run with that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I've only heard of him, but he sounds incredibly promising, like potentially world class promising, which if the rumour of him costing around 8m Euros it could be an absolute steal. I've done a bit of reading and this is what I've found so far:

While this has been his breakthrough season he's being touted as one of the BEST young french leftbacks in the world and considering that Mendy, Kurzawa and Digne all exist that is a HUGE amount of praise.

He not only got into Whoscored.com's Under21 European team of the season, but the main European XI as well, getting the second highest rating in Ligue 1 (7.74) only behind Ibrahimovic (7.75). 

Defensivly he got into the top 5 for Tackles made per game (3.9), No. 1 for the most interceptions made per game (4.6) and accordng to Squwaka.com he made almost as many interceptions as he did clearances, which to put in perspective Cissokho made 4 times as many clearances than interceptions, Hutton 3 times as many. This has led him to making the MOST interceptions of any player in the top 5 European leagues.

Offensivly, no other full back made more successful dribbles per game in ligue 1, and is within the top 20 for the league for all positions. Finally, as far as I'm aware no other Left Back scored more than his 4 goals in Ligue 1.

&gt;He may only be 21, but despite Nice’s struggles near the bottom of the French table, Amavi has proven himself to be both a useful weapon offensively and a competent performer defensively. While those around him have struggled, Amavi deserves immense credit for maintaining a consistent level of excellent performance and for developing his own game during the course of the campaign. Amavi, despite his slender years, possesses the maturity and the in-game intelligence of a much older player

&gt;Source: http://www.caughtoffside.com/2015/03/27/jordan-amavi-destined-for-great-things-after-stunning-ligue-1-campaign/

&gt;Still a developing talent in his breakthrough season Amavi has tremendous potential and could be turning out for one of Europe’s top clubs as soon as next season. But he needs guaranteed game time to catch up with the likes of Digne and Kurzawa and then  breakinto the French national team. Jordan Amavi has the potential to become a truly world class full back. He is playing exceptionally well for OGC Nice. His defensive stability and consistency this season set him apart from the rest. But he needs a better club than bottom of the table Nice to continue his  further development.

null,false,madjoy,null,null,null,"I don't think Bilic will be fired if he doesn't finish top 8.  I think there IS something in his contract about how he will be fired with no compensation if we get relegated, or at least that's the rumour I've heard.

I'm feeling good about the transfer window!  Payet and Ogbonna are both smart signings that should improve the squad.  We still really need an RB.  Rumours are that we'll get Jenks back on loan pretty soon, but our backup RB (Joey O'Brien) isn't at the standard of the rest of the squad now, so we really need to get that sorted.  

Our striker situation is okay, but Sakho is the only one I have confidence in to get 15+ goals... Valencia could still come good but hasn't proven himself.  And Andy Carroll is fantastic when he's fit, but he hasn't been fit for us often enough to count on.  The owners plan to get in another striker (possibly on loan) still this window, and I agree that's a smart idea.

If we lose Downing (and reports sound like he wants out), we may need to further strengthen his position, too, at least for depth.

I think a lot of us were surprised that Bilic made a new CB one of his top priorities because it was a position I thought we were more sorted in (3 starter-quality CBs already - Reid, Tomkins, and Collins with Reid and Tomkins both having just signed new long-term contracts - and 3 younger players on the verge of breaking through - Doneil Henry, Reece Burke, and Reece Oxford).  But Bilic watched the videos of us playing last year and said that's what he wanted.  To be fair, we have had CB injury crises both of the last 2 years, and our defensive record last year wasn't amazing.

I'm not actually expecting us to get top 6 this season even with the additions, but it's nice just to be pushing for it.  I do think we'll be closer to the ""push for Europa"" battle than the relegation battle... and that alone is exciting!! Realistically, though, a lot of our competitors have done a good job strengthening during this window, too (Stoke and Crystal Palace come to mind, and Southampton and Swansea are going to be tough to beat, too).  Plus, with a new manager and so many new, foreign players, it could take time for everything to click together.  And if we make the group stages of the Europa League, that could take a toll on player fatigue.  So all of our strengthening and ambition could end up being just to stand still.

Still, in the long term, I think we're in a good position relative to the other teams.  We're moving to a bigger stadium in a year (and we have the fan base to fill it or at least come close), we're in London (which seems to help attract players), and Bilic is the epitome of cool.  We have owners who are true fans of the club, buy pretty smartly, communicate a lot with the fans (maybe too much ;)), and don't sack managers on a whim.  We have a history of a strong academy, and though our last manager (Big Sam) didn't build on that or give them a chance, they've cleaned out some of the guys who were never going to make it and now we've got a number of exciting prospects again.  Plus, this season we've got the Europa League for extra matches so everyone will get a runout! Oh, and Bilic has just said he wants more goals from midfield - so here's hoping we keep building on the exciting, attacking game we had at the start of last year when we rocketed to 4th at Christmas!

The only thing I'm worried about, and the one thing that nobody seems to really know how it would work, is if they sell the loans to a private company, who then change the interest rates or change the terms of the repayment. It seems that must be illegal, but I don't know. And - again, I'm saying all this with the hope that somebody who knows more about it can comment - if it got really bad, you've got SO many people with these loans, that if the majority of people said, nope, we never agreed to those terms, we're not paying, I don't really see what a private company could do about that.

4. Getting rid of the means-tested grants for university to be replaced with more generous loans. (It _really_ sucked before if you were told you were too rich for grants but then couldn't borrow the money either due to the limited loans)

Quote:

The chief constable said a member of the public had called the 101 non-emergency number at about 11:30 on Sunday after seeing the car down the embankment near the Bannockburn slip road.

The call had been taken by an ""experienced officer"", who remains on duty. However, ""for reasons yet to be established"" this was never entered into systems or sent out to operational teams in the area.

Sir Stephen said: ""Firstly I want to apologise to the families of John Yuill and Lamara Bell and to the people of Scotland for this individual failure in our service. Everyone in Police Scotland feels this most profoundly.

""Our duty is to keep people safe and we've not done that effectively on this occasion, with tragic consequences, and I want to apologise to everyone for that.

""I completely understand the level of concern being raised about the circumstances surrounding the handling of the incident of the crash near the M9 slip road at Bannockburn and, in particular, Police Scotland's response to information received.

""That we failed both families involved is without doubt.""

Imagine an election with 3 parties in it: A, B and C. 130 people vote in the election with the alternate vote, listing in their order of preference. 

Votes|Order
:--|:--
49|ABC
40|CAB
39|BCA
2|BAC

No one has a majority there so C is eliminated (note B has 41 votes), and his 40 votes are all transferred to the second preference of A.

Votes|Order
:--|:--
49|ABC
40|~~C~~AB
39|BCA
2|BAC

A now has 50+41=91 votes, which is a majority and wins the election. 

Let’s redo the election but this time the 2 people who voted BAC instead decide they like A more so vote ABC 

Votes|Order
:--|:--
49+2|ABC
40|CAB
39|BCA

This time B has the least number of votes and is eliminated and all his votes are given to C


Votes|Order
:--|:--
49+2|ABC
40|CAB
39|~~B~~CA

Now C has 40+39 votes and hence has a majority.

This is a problem because in the first election A won, yet in the second election 2 people decided to vote for A instead of B and that caused Party A to lose, which means 2 people deciding to lend their support to A actually made A lose the election, which doesn't make sense, you've created a situation where you want to not vote for your favourite party because it can cripple their chances of winning.",null,0,null,1436708739,null,0,false,0,ct0na2q,null,t3_3cwju1,null,t1_ct0na2q,null,t1_ct0j441,null,null,null,1437792839,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I'm from Scotland so there may be a slight difference in England but while you can get a college course in legal secretarial skills you don't need it -  our firm hired secretaries with no experience and trained them up.

Have you searched job sites to see what they are asking for? Indeed.co.UK would be a good place to start and give you an idea of how you can apply your existing skills or develop new ones.

Brush up on the rules of civil procedure for whichever part of the UK you go too, so you can see how it compares in your area of expertise. Look up the court website and it should give you sample court forms and the basic process so you can compare this to what you know. I'd say England is your best bet as like you say, there are similarities as the Canadian system was based on the English.

Others have addressed a lot of points in detail here already,but here are a few points:

Globalisation has meant a lot of non-tech products are cheaper than they were a generation ago, but at some other cost e.g. good cheap clothes  + made in dodgy conditions in countries like Bangladesh. Similar with those duvet covers.

Some things in your examples- frying pans (non-stuck coating), and printing the pattern on the duvet cover- one does not think of as tech, but involve tech somewhere.

Where things remain kind of the same price there are certain things that are important unrelated to the product like making it worthwhile to make and market the thing in the first place.

null,false,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,null,"The Orange Order was formed explicitly to smash the United Irishmen and the unity between Catholics and Presbyterians. 

&gt; In July 1795 a Reverend Devine had preached a sermon at Drumcree Church to commemorate the ""Battle of the Boyne"".[21] In his History of Ireland Vol I (published in 1809), the historian Francis Plowden described the events that followed this sermon:

&gt;""Reverend Devine so worked up the minds of his audience, that upon retiring from service, on the different roads leading to their respective homes, they gave full scope to the anti-papistical zeal, with which he had inspired them... falling upon every Catholic they met, beating and bruising them without provocation or distinction, breaking the doors and windows of their houses, and actually murdering two unoffending Catholics in a bog. This unprovoked atrocity of the Protestants revived and redoubled religious rancour. The flame spread and threatened a contest of extermination...""

The ""Battle of the Diamond was an engineered Battle"", hyped up on lies, misinformation and propaganda. Sectarian Tension had actually dissipated due to the actions of the United Irishmen. Only to be stoked up again.

&gt; Under the influence of the United Irishmen according to T. A. Jackson, political unity was replacing sectarian divisions in Ulster. This he says inspired ""public-spirited zeal"" in Catholic areas with areas like Armagh where the population had been evenly divided and the scene of sporadic violence between the Peep O'Day Boys and Catholic Defenders for years **dying down to nothing under the influence of the United Irish**. However with the arrival of the new pro-Catholic Viceroy, Earl Fitzwilliam the Peep of Day boys resumed their activity after nearly a two-year absence. Jackson suggests that it is impossible to miss the connection between this fact, and the lie propagated by the Clare-Beresford faction that Fitzwilliam was there to replace the Protestant ascendancy with a Catholic one. With Defenders, again in action, he says, every successful defence against Peep of Day attack being then portrayed as a ""Catholic outrage."" This ""artificially worked-up pogrom"" would culminate in what came to be known as the Battle of the Diamond.[9] In the aftermath of the ""battle"" which occurred on 21 September 1795 the Orange Society was founded, with the first Orange lodge established in Dyan, County Tyrone. Its first grand master was James Sloan of Loughgall, in who's inn the victory by the Peep O'Day Boys was celebrated.[10][Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Orange_Institution)

Within two months of the formation of the Orange Order 7,000 Catholics had been driven from there homes in Armagh.

&gt; He says that a determination was expressed to ""driving from this quarter of the county the entire of its Roman Catholic population"", with notices posted warning them ""to Hell or Connaught"".[18] Other people were warned by notices not to inform on local Orangemen or ""I will blow your soul to the low hills of Hell and burn the house you are in"".[18] Within two months, 7000 Catholics had been driven out of County Armagh.[18] According to Lord Gosford, the governor of Armagh:
&gt; 
&gt; It is no secret that a persecution is now raging in this country… the only crime is… profession of the Roman Catholic faith. Lawless banditti have constituted themselves judges... and the sentence they have denounced... is nothing less than a confiscation of all property, and an immediate banishment.[18]

The Formation of the Order was willfully spurred on by powerful elites who feared the unity of Catholics and Protestants.
&gt; 
&gt; The “Castle clique” of the Protestant Ascendancy retorted *""by rousing up the more ignorant, debased, corrupt, and reactionary stratum,""* according to T. A. Jackson. The objective was to create disunity and disorder under pretence of ""passion for the Protestant religion"". This view was shared by John Mitchel, who wrote *“The chief object of the Government was now to invent and disseminate fearful rumours of intended massacres of all the Protestant people by the Catholics.""* As a result of the efforts and influence of the United Irishmen, sectarian divisions were being replaced by political unity. Religion therefore was the last option left to the reactionaries, and to stock the traditional fear of the Papacy and hostility to the Catholic religion. Dr. Daniel Owen Madden says of this period:
&gt; 
&gt;  ""Efforts were made to infuse into the mind of the Protestant feelings of distrust to his Catholic fellow-countrymen. Popish plots and conspiracies were fabricated with a practical facility, which some influential authorities conceived it no degradation to stoop to; and alarming reports of these dark confederations were circulated with a restless assiduity""

&gt; I need to get out of the vicious cycle I'm in where all my spare money per month goes towards paying off existing credit card debts, but then I end up with such little in the bank that I end up using the credit card again and the card balance at the end of the month ends up at the same as before, if not more.

Then that's not your spare money. It's not spare if you need it.

null,false,ottffs,null,null,null,"First off, let's be clear that money should be no issue for anyone wanting to go to university in England - the government pays up front, in the form of 'loans'. The view the English legislation takes is that students for which higher education worked out well should pay some of the cost of giving that education back. If it didn't and you don't get a particularly good job then you don't pay anything. 

The coalition actually made it much more fair when they increased both the level at which you begin paying it back and the fees themselves. In the UK system we basically have three types of people: The poor who pay nothing for their loan, the rich who pay it all but have enough money that they basically don't notice, and the people in the middle who pay some but the amount they pay has more of an impact on their lives than the rich. When the coalition increased the level you start paying back at, they boosted the amount of people in the poor category and reduced the number in the middle, paying nothing. When they increased the fees, they reduced the number of people in the rich category and increased the number in the middle.

This makes it more 'fair' overall as ideally you want to have everyone in the middle where they pay according to their income. Personally I support 'infinite' fees, or a graduate tax in other words.

Now, when it comes to comparing to other home nations, this has pretty much just become a political issue. When Labour ran with making fees 6k they were trying to boost their support among students and the less well off trying to go to university, when the only people it would help are those moving into the rich category. Scotland for example could never consider increasing fees just because of the backlash from the misinformed.

There is a debate that can be had over rates of repayment etc, but people always seem to focus on the headline '£9000' figure and so it's unlikely we'll hear it.

null,false,trichomania93,,Labour Member,null,"Hi there guys, I joined the party after the election and I've decided to back Yvette Cooper for leader. Since this is my first comment here I felt a bit of background would be a good place to start!

When I saw that harriet harman was trending on twitter, I knew straight away she'd done something to annoy the lefty set because 'harman' was trending and not 'harperson'. I had a look and sure enough everyone was complaining about a compromise of labour values and all the rest of it.

Now when the budget was announced it was clear to me we needed to agree with some of it considering the positive press it was getting (except on twitter), I'm not sure if this particular area is the right place in the budget to do it since I suspect it will impact disproportionately on single mothers and I'm surprised this is where Harman chose to agree considering her well earned reputation on equalities.

However before I condemn it, I do want to point out there people in the mail + speccie comment sections who are 

1. calling Harriet by her real name, a victory in itself
2. Calling for her to be made leader! 

It's quite a turnaround considering I'd have picked her as the 'most despised shadow cabinet member by the right wing', especially now Ed Balls has gone.

So maybe this is the right thing to do strategically? What does everyone else think?

Also, I can't say I think he is a great passer, OK sure, but not great. Doesn't sound like someone who could play in our midfield, even Joe Allen who I just think is overrated in his usefulness as a depth player on here, is a terrific passer. Sorta the reverse Benteke problem, Allens not a player on the level we need, but he fits what we do well. Benteke is a good player, but fits us horribly. 

Illarramendi would be a really interesting option to bring in rather cheap. If he is more than £20+ I wouldn't look at him, but he is an interesting player. Schooled much more as a defensive midfielder than anyone in our current midfield, yet a terrific passer. Obviously things have gone less than ideal for him at Madrid, but he was brilliant for Sociedad. Solid as a rock defensively, which we certainly need, and had a big part in Griezmann and Velas great seasons as the deep playmaker. I'd take Illarramendi over Sissoko, despite Illarra being a little more risky of a signing. Better fit, better potential.

Debts are sold. They're traded and swapped on the stock market. The money that's made off the traded debt actually generates money. The government sold £40bn in student debt only recently. There were people willing to buy up that debt because it's worth trading.

2/3 of students loans ARE paid off. People in their 40s are now talking about having paid off their education. Even if they only paid off half - with the added interest it's all money in the pot.

1/3 of student loans are paid of quite quickly. 10% of the country has a wage of 45k or more and that doesn't include many freelancers and small business owners who on paper earn less than that but have a lifestyle income of above 45k.

Is the 31k before or after tax? The reason the mortgage calculators said you'd be able to borrow 100k is because you don't have any assets. Therefore, the money is at a higher risk to them - if (for example) the housing market crashes and you lose your job so you can't pay the mortgage, they'd be out of pocket.

If you had assets (e.g. you had more money for the downpayment), then they'd happily lend you more money, because if the stock market crashes and you can't pay the mortgage, they'd be able to repossess your part of the house (or you'd take out a second loan using the rest of the property).

If you're saving £900-1000 monthly, after five years, with your current savings and without interest you'd have £57-63k in savings. 

With that kind of downpayment, you're likely to be able to buy a house.

Although:

* You should be looking to put your savings in an ISA. With interest, you'd have more, and in an ISA, it'd be tax free.

* The housing market relative to the pound could crash. It could also rise steeply, pricing you out (unlikely, people are already strained)

* First Direct says you can borrow 139,000 - http://mortgages.firstdirect.com/mortgage-calculators

So I think you could realistically own a 200k house in 5 years.

However:

* Why do you want to own a two bedroom home so much? You could just as equally put your money into a savings account, or a stocks and shares ISA (if you're a bit braver)

* If you're desperate to move out, maybe you should - the peace of mind independence gives is also an asset

[From the ONS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/family-demography/family-size/2012/family-size-rpt.html), we find that there over 1.1m families with 3+ children. Not only was this a cut which Cameron [promised he wouldn't enforce](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/budget-2015-watch-david-cameron-6033885) (for some reason he assumes he's above accountability, unlike Clegg), but this is a cruel cut which places pressure on less well off families and parents in a tough place. Your Daily Mail article cites a much more extreme situation, representing an incredibly rare and misleading [(&lt;.5%)](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-the-truth-about-the-child-benefits-cap/11739) situation, but a situation which is still in our interests to address. A small number of people which are affected doesn't mean it doesn't matter, but how this is presented is clearly misleading this situation to be representative of all large families, many of which have much more complex problems which need support. Fundamentally, this is a cut which not only discourages less well off families to have children in a Social Darwinist style of politics, but this is a cut which will directly harm vulnerable children which are in poverty.  This report summarises the impact these cuts will have:

&gt; Finch said: Taking £5 billion out of child tax credit would lead to millions of low-income working families being made significantly worse off – a family with two children could lose up to £1,690 a year in 2017 - prolonging the squeeze on living standards.

&gt; Efforts to boost pay - such as raising the minimum wage and encouraging take-up of the living wage – are welcome, but it would take heroic pay rises to offset the losses caused by severe cuts to tax credits.

A [good petition getting a quarter of a million signatures](https://speakout.38degrees.org.uk/campaigns/stop-child-tax-credit-cuts) summarised why these tax credits are so valuable:

&gt; All children deserve to start life on an equal footing. But low wages can put barriers in the way of a happy and healthy childhood. That’s why some of the poorest families get help to pay for essentials, like healthy food and school uniforms.

null,false,Tolosan,null,null,null,"Hello,

Firstly I haven't downvoted you, as your question is a good one to which I feel there are good answers. I'm going to assume no particular knowledge of how insurance works for anyone else reading this, so I apologise if you're already familiar with a lot of these concepts. I don't work in insurance sales, though I do work in complaints handling for the Payment Protection Insurance mis-selling scandal (for an institution who sold policies, not for a claims management company).

There's a few reasons why public provision of unemployment insurance is a good idea. Firstly, any insurance relies on the pooling of risks. For car insurance, you pay your premiums and might never claim, but your insurer has assessed your risk based on several factors and calculated based what they need to charge you based on the likelihood of people like you (in terms of age, location, that sort of thing) making a claim. They also need to make their profit on top of that. As with any calculation involving expected returns based on an uncertain future, there is a risk that expected returns will not be met (this is [downside risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downside_risk)). 

You might find that next month people much like you make fewer claims than expected. Great! More profit. However, the following month, more people on average crash their cars, and make claims. So the risk that expected returns are not met will be realised, and you might take a loss on that month. Normally, this is factored into the price of premiums and it is a reckless insurance business indeed that does not model this price in.

That said, it is important to understand that the **the more people that are insured by the same provider (i.e., are part of the same [risk pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_pool)) then the less variable the actual return will be**. If your pool is comprised of a hundred people, and your business can remain solvent if (to pull numbers from thin air) if only 3 make a claim in a given month, then there is much more risk of trouble than if you have a pool of 1000 people and can survive with 30 claiming per month.

The issue then, is why don't we bother making all insurance behave this way, including car insurance? Generally in western mixed economies we tend to leave things that the private sector does fine to their capable hands. For car insurance, they are more than capable. This is for a few reasons. The most important for our purposes is that car insurance claims are fairly predictable. In any given month, you don't have a substantial variability of claims (and any such as seasonal factors are well understood, predictable, and factored into the price of insurance). Even unexpected events, like the unknown tendency of a given make of car to spontaneously combust, are relatively small in a wider context.

Unemployment insurance is *very* different. While there is a regular level of claims for unemployment insurance, we live in a capitalist economy where the system periodically [shits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) [the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) [bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession) as a feature well understood (in the sense that this happens is understood) and widely agreed on. **These crises have strong consequences of spiking unemployment, raising the cost of meeting insurance claims just at the same time as private insurers, like all businesses, are being pressured by financial instability.** Critically for pricing this risk in to the cost, risk models simply can't do it because often these events are not known about before hand, then explode onto the scene and cause panic. 

Suddenly, **just when the unemployment cover offered by private insurance firms is needed most, that same insurance business is suffering a spike in claims which it was almost certainly unable to account for properly with usual insurance risk models**. Remember, after all, that we have just emerged from a financial crisis where a central cause of the problems were the failure of risk modelling, which as the CEO of Goldman Sachs noted in 2007, resulted in Goldman Sachs  [""seeing  things  that  were  25-standard  deviation moves,  several days in a row.”](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1103/1103.5672.pdf). As that paper notes, based on a normal distribution a 25-sigma event - well, you can read it yourself, but based on an event happening once a day, by the time you get to 20-sigma you're talking about an event that you should expect to occur only once in (1 year * 10 times the estimated number of particles in the universe). So you can see the issue here.

So you have smaller insurance pools due to insurance competition, meaning those spikes are even nastier as you can't spread it out over lots of people, so unemployment insurance companies are going to start being unable to pay their claims. This is what has historically happened in the case of mutual societies (popular before the Depression), which just couldn't meet the demands placed on them. It's also why charity is a terrible replacement for government insurance, as charity is great during the good times but dries up exactly when it is needed.** By contrast, governments are the lender of last resort (in countries that control their own currency) and so have much greater resilience than companies.** That is doubly so for strong western governments like the US and the UK; the day that these institutions look financially wobbly, you've got much bigger problems, and that's aside from their advantages due to having a huge risk pool (comprised of essentially every taxpayer, paying NI or not, in the country).

There's also a few additional factors to consider. The first is [information asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry), notoriously a problem in the complex world of financial services. Basically it's the issue that the seller knows a lot more about the product than the buyer does, and has little incentive to disabuse customers of this notion (they were, after all, making absolutely tons off of this product). This is one of the reasons the PPI Scandal became so big - sellers sold customers policies that often didn't cover them, or were too expensive for what they offered (among a host of other issues). There was a lot of variability between different policies, including limitations and exclusions, and particularly before regulations came in 2005 the attitude of sellers was largely one of 'caveat emptor', with customers not particularly well placed to assess the suitability of the policy for their situation. While the government is hardly transparent, by having one system people understand it a lot better as there is no variability; there are also few exclusions on government unemployment compared to that offered privately. Furthermore, if there are problems with that system, they are much more likely to affect more people, which can then be democratically expressed, whereas before the FSA (now FCA) stepped in the attitude of PPI sellers to complaints was ""sucks to be you.""

You can, of course, get round the problem by having a monopoly provider (as mentioned by another respondent to your post), but then what's the point? You do get your large risk pool, but you get the weakness of a private insurance provider to financial shocks and unpredictable risks without the upside of competition that the free market provides, as tendering for government contracts is no meaningful sense competition. 

On top of all this even under a private system, unemployment insurance would have to be mandatory. I work in insurance, and a *lot* of customers say they wouldn't been made redundant. Few think they are going to be until the worst happens, and should the worst happen then we're talking about people being unable to feed themselves, likely not be able to home themselves - these are not acceptable risks for society to take. Mobile phone insurance is optional because ultimately you're not going to starve if you don't have it and your phone gets nicked. Unemployment insurance? Not so much.

Whew, that was longer than expected, but yeah this is why regardless of your particular attitudes to the free market if we're going to have our current system private unemployment insurance is a really, really bad idea.   

Tl;dr: Government unemployment insurance ensures a very large risk pool which is a good thing, and the unemployment tends to spike in connection with financial and economic crises that typically can't be modelled by insurance risk models (or by any other for that matter). When these spikes happen, insurance companies are at their weakest while the government remains stable and can provide the guarantee that private providers cannot. With private insurance, the buyer may not be able to assess providers appropriately, and the cost of failure to do so (or the failure to buy insurance in the first place) is simply unacceptably high for both the buyer and for wider society.",null,0,null,1436721449,null,0,1436721800,0,ct0t22w,null,t3_3czysi,null,t1_ct0t22w,null,t1_ct0kivk,null,null,null,1437796950,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Eventually it led to me going into a shop and smiling at an assistant, asking them if i can try something on, and then making a choice as to whether I would buy it or not. I ended up not buying it, as I decided it was too much, and telling the assistant that was actually harder than buying the damn thing, but it was totally worth it, because it shows you that people aren't there to get you, they're generally always there to help you and be nice.

The 31k is before tax. It's roughly £1700 a month take-home - I say roughly because my first pay was rather large as it was for more than a month's pay, and the second had a couple of days sickness deductions. This month's pay will be accurate. 

I thought of a two bed as they're not that much more expensive than 1 bedders and have room for changes in life. However, a 1 bed is more than fine for me too - I just want my own, secure space. 

I'm perhaps a bit anxious as I know a lot of the reason why home ownership is so important here is the culture surrounding it. Financially it also makes more sense but I want to make sure I'm writing renting off for the right financial reasons.

I partially agree but you have to consider the radical changes to the environmental landscape. University attendance, even back when it was free, was a fraction of what it is now. Ironically more people now can afford to go to University instead of going straight into work.  

As a parallel, the fact I could get free university now doesn't mean I want everyone in the future to pay what I paid, I would like it to be free (if the Courtney can afford it).

Also after CBT you can push for further help if you feel like the CBT isn't enough. 

All of this can be done through your GP, and also talk to your family about what's going on in your head. 

Also, as for your dark thoughts check if your current medication has them as a listed side effect, as they can cause that to happen sometimes.

Now Ibe excites me more. He is similar to Sterling but he's got more raw power and strength. I know he's not been banging in goals but I feel this season. Given the chance, he will score between 5 &amp; 10 goals. He's just got to keep a cool head in front of goal.  So hopefully he gets a few early in year. 

The only thing that irritates me about all this is we've given Sterling every opportunity to grow here. Kenny first gave him his chance. ""Run at him Raheem"" And now it feels like a spit in the face. I know loyalty is a thing of the past and in all fairness if I was offered a 400-500% raise at a different company I'd take it.

The pills are OK, but I've had by far better results with CBT techniques. If you have the strength, there is a lot of truth in pushing through with interaction and it gets better. I'm a teacher so I've had to push pretty hard, and been crap a fair few times, I'm leaving the profession but I've definitely benefitted from the 8 years I've spent teaching. My anxiety is less social and more other things now.

Sorry for the bit of a ramble, but know that it's manageable, even beatable, but everyone responds differently to different techniques. I highly recommend finding a CBT practitioner that you get on with (might be hard through IAPT, go private if you can afford it at all). If you're near Coventry I can recommend someone.

In my experience beating anxiety is a one step at a time thing. There's lots of stuff on social anxiety (starting by looking up as you walk, then actively engaging people in eye contact, etc). I have a friend who actively tried to beat it himself with great results doing stupid stuff that was intentionally embarrassing (going into a hardware store and asking for tampons, or trying to get a cup of sugar from a bar, etc.). 

Bascially what I'm saying is: don't give up. Keep chipping away. Keep rational, when we turn the light on our anxiety it often looks ridiculous. Learn to laugh at it, because while it doesn't feel like it at the time, some of the reactions we have are silly in the grand scheme of things.

Yeah she had 8 kids to exploit the system, she's a shitty person, but her life consists of looking after those 8 kids and everyone hating her for exploiting the system, which is punishment enough in itself. 

Also why is everyone so fixated on chasing down poor people who exploit the system to the extent that people are frothing at the mouth over £26,000 a year to this woman, while billions are evaded in tax by corporations and the government does nothing? 

 People like this woman are costing next to nothing in the overall scheme of things and would cost more to fight against, just like we're seeing with all benefit claimants. 

But we need to take money off someone to pay for the crash (still!) and it isn't going to be the rich, so the government &amp; Tory media work together to make people think people who cheat the benefit system are the biggest problem of our time. 

&gt;Me and the girlfriend are arguing over whether or not we can afford one.

See I don't like that this is such a massive issue today, people are really struggling to afford to have even one child, and that will keep getting worse until people are priced out of having children. 

The government seem to be heading towards disincentivizing people having children, whereas I think there should be enough support for people to have kids, but a cash incentive to not have kids.

Peter Shilton makes an astute comment about this in his auto-biography. He argues that a **great goalie** does not make many saves/interceptions because he organizes his defense in such a way that he doesn't have to make saves. A merely **good goalie**, on the other hand, makes lots of saves and interceptions because he is unable to organize his defense. As a result, statistically speaking, the great goalie might look weaker due to a low ratio of saved goals. The low ratio is on account of allowing fewer shots, and the shots he does allow tend to be much more of a clear-cut chance. 

What /u/nrolo24 (and Peter Shilton) is pointing out, then, is lots of interventions are far more important than the type of stats that can be counted.

Now we have too many in general but can't afford to properly supply resourced for the ones we are short of. Second off we are on about maintenance mot tuition, there were grants before but nowhere near as plentiful or accessible as this. This means anyone can afford to live whilst at uni, and afford not to work whilst doing so, which we know leads to lower scores and performance.

So why? Why shouldn't you pay back the money for food and rent that you got whilst subsidised heavily to do a very expensive thing that you choose to do in order to better yourself? It doesn't reduce accessibility because this is a debt specifically designed not to cripple you, it's the best loan anyone will ever get, so it's not an equal access to knowledge or opportunity thing. 

You think you're owed that free money? For being unproductive? Heck, we the taxpayer take a punt on you being made more productive later and even if you DON'T then we don't take as much money back.

What you're saying is you think people who never went to uni and people who went to learn skills that the country needs, should pay money that could be spent on alliviating poverty or fixing infrastructure, for you to have fun.

Uni can be fun, but the only reason it is even slightly funded is because society expects you to earn more and pay more taxes, or be able to do things we need that not enough people can do. That is the attitude that has always existed and if people hadnt started treating uni as the default choice after alevels, and weren't treating it like a way to delay getting a career, then we might be able to afford the cheaper fees and grants others had.",null,0,null,1436724080,null,0,1436724288,0,ct0ugby,null,t3_3d07l2,null,t1_ct0ugby,null,t1_ct0tm2u,null,null,null,1437798060,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

So £45 mil for a younger and less creative, English Navas. I'm sorry, it just doesn't strike me as good business especially if the wage rumors of £200k a week are true. We're still paying Yaya £350k +.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the article basically says Rodgers and the club were nothing short of bullies in how they handled the situation. No quotes, no attempt to put the chronology of events into perspective beyond a quick defense of sterling.

I'm not saying that at all - but I *am* saying that capping benefits going forward is at the very least a fair way to approach the benefits system before it gets the life sucked out of it.

&gt;Yeah she had 8 kids to exploit the system, she's a shitty person, but her life consists of looking after those 8 kids and everyone hating her for exploiting the system, which is punishment enough in itself.

Quite the gilded cage, no? 18 years with a guaranteed income.

&gt;Also why is everyone so fixated on chasing down poor people who exploit the system to the extent that people are frothing at the mouth over £26,000 a year to this woman, while billions are evaded in tax by corporations and the government does nothing?

I'm not saying that corporate tax evasion is moral - what I *am* saying is that continuing to pay baby factories to ""punish themselves"" to a life of raising kids is also unfair.

Primarily the risk that the things you invest in could fall in value - most will tend towards increasing value if they're given long enough for all the ups and downs to average out, but they could spend a year or several in a low before turning back upwards. 

So if you're on a short timer before you'll need to withdraw it's possible you'd be forced to sell in that dip, and hence the normal advice is to aim for a 5-10 year term (or more).",null,0,null,1436724853,null,0,false,0,ct0uuye,null,t3_3d108a,null,t1_ct0uuye,null,t1_ct0tioq,null,null,null,1437798376,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

Personally for me Sterling was not our best player nor our brightest prospect. That honour goes to Coutinho. Sterling had terrible finishing especially in the second half of the season, while COutinho has produced some magical goals. For 49 million, it's a massive coup for us, and we must reinvest it well. We've done brilliant business so far, so we have that to be proud of, and I think the likes of Coutinho and Firmino together has the potential to be a wonderful duo to watch, and with Sterling gone I think we will be all the better without him.

For me, we're most likely stronger challengers now, but it will still be a massive achievement to beat the likes of Chelsea, Man Utd, Arsenal or City out of the top four (although City strike me as the weakest).

Don't worry though those who managed to grab some cash can look after their families and send their grandkids to university. If you were born with no rich relatives however you are on your own. Now fucking get back to work with lower wages less prospects and massive debt and shut the fuck up while your at it. 42 thousand pounds of debt before you start work. Not really a level playing field is it.

Get a nice media job from someone your dad knows and work for free because your supported by your family. You tell me of a 18 year old who has earned anything. So why should one child be able to do fucking dance and another have to do hairdressing or building because they have no other choice.

Some people work their arse off and barely feed their families and some do fuck all and pop off to Barbados if they've had a bad day. Divide the fucked against the more Fucked and leave the asset stealing cash grabbing elites to watch the show.

&gt;Of course they didn't say 'it's definitely because of debt', you can't make those kind of statements unless the person committing suicide explicitly says so.

No they didn't say 'it's definitely because of debt' because that correlation is tenuous at best and doesn't actually take into account differences starting when the fee increase came in. That would be because it's an old study. It actually mentions job prospects more than debt and isn't actually any kind of scientific study.

There is no player in La Liga aged 21 or under that has completed even half as many dribbles as Sterling this season.

When I started transitioning back into public transport, I downloaded an app to tell me what time the bus was exactly due (therefore i'm not standing around in public waiting for a bus for 20 minutes) which gradually got me a tiny bit more confident to be outside.

A few months ago I just got more confident and applied for a job (way below my skill level in a factory) and I got it.

At first I was scared, never talked and got all nervous when someone would talk to me or try to make conversation, now i've been there 3 months and i'd like to think i've made 1 or 2 friends from my job and I sit with other guys I work with in the canteen on my breaks.

I wasn't on medication and I don't believe my anxiety was as severe as some peoples like yourself but it is a mental thing, and once you start getting over small barriers you could see a different outlook on yourself.

6 months ago I wouldn't have thought i'd be the person I currently am right now.

The engine isn't bad and there's no rust but many of the sensors and bits have had to be replaced which have made running it fairly costly in the long run and it still runs like crap.

I bought it after writing off my previous Fiesta and was in a bit of a rush to get a new car since I had to drive to college. If I could go back in time I would have got an early MX5 instead.

1997 Toyota Supra - It's a good looking car, goes fast enough for me, very comfortable to sit in and drive, didn't cost a huge amount to buy (around 3700). Bad points are the mpg, visibility and massive blind spots, and the literal zero legroom in the back seats (you couldn't slide a piece of paper in that gap). It also needs a bit of work which is going to be moderately expensive but I bought it as a project car anyway so it's fine.

[This is what I imagine we'll look like with the 4-2-3-1.](http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=7r7v)  
This will probably mostly be for games where we're confident we can completely overwhelm the opposition with the quality of our attack as Yaya and Pogba don't provide much cover in defense. However, if Pogba does arrive I think Yaya might take on a Fernandinho-esque role where he'll sit back more often as Pogba does the majority of the offensive work, in that way their partnership in midfield will be better balanced and Yaya won't be completely exhausted by running back and forth for 90 minutes, not to mention that it'll make it easier for Fernandinho to slide in when Yaya does need a break.  
The attack is crazy, De Bruyne, Silva and Sterling are all top quality and can all switch positions to mix up play and mess with the opposition's tactics, it won't be nearly as imbalanced as our attack currently is where there's a heavy focus on defending Silva's side as our right side is notably weaker. This is a Champions League winning-quality attack, it has so much potential that even the concept of it is worth salivating over.

[As far as the 4-3-3 goes this is what I have in mind.](http://lineupbuilder.com/2014/custom/?sk=7r7k)  
This should be used for matches where the opposition is also very strong in attack, like Barca, Arsenal or Liverpool. Here Yaya is pushed further ahead as Fernandinho takes over most of his defensive responsibilities, though of course all three midfielders have a defensive job to do. The only unfortunate thing here is that we lose the versatility in attack that the 4-2-3-1 brings, not to mention we need to bench a great player like Sterling, but I feel like a more conservative formation is also needed as we've looked too reckless against attacking teams. There's also the idea of trying out De Bruyne or Silva in the midfield in an Iniesta-esque role instead of bringing in a new midfielder (damn you Delph!), this will also allow all of our star attacking midfielders to be present, but I think that'd only be something to try if Yaya is out.

Anyways, those are just some ideas. If we nail all three of our main targets it's true that we're going to be stacked on superstars, but imo that's a wonderful problem to have, with proper rotation and formation tinkering everybody can get enough playing time. As Yaya and Silva get older it'll also be fantastic to have Pogba and De Bruyne already being ready to pick up their reins immediately.",null,0,null,1436727074,null,0,1436727406,0,ct0w25x,null,t3_3d15yy,null,t1_ct0w25x,null,t3_3d15yy,null,null,null,1437798813,null,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3,null

&gt;___The Muppet Show___ is a family-oriented [comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketch_comedy)-[variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show) television series that was produced by puppeteer [Jim Henson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Henson) and features [The Muppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets). After two pilot episodes produced in 1974 and 1975 failed to get the attention of America's network executives, [Lew Grade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Grade) approached Henson to produce the programme for [ATV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Television)'s ITV franchise in the United kingdom. The show lasted for five series consisting of 120 episodes which were first broadcast in Britain between 5 September 1976 and 15 March 1981 over ATV and [syndicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-run_syndication) to local broadcast stations elsewhere. The programmes were recorded at ATV's [Elstree Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elstree_Studios) just north of London.

null,false,ElChrissinho,null,null,null,"We'll never find out what's gone on in Raheem's head for it to get to this point but I'd really like to know. I don't buy the Facebook consensus that he's a money-grabbing twat, I think it's hugely unlikely that this has anything to do with money. Ego and ambition, perhaps, but not money. I think his agent has probably played a part too. He ensured bridges were burned and now he's going to be set up financially for a long time. I doubt it's anything to do with Rodgers either. Maybe by the end Sterling got it into his head that he had a problem with his manager to give him another excuse to leave. In all likelihood it's another half-arsed excuse. Raheem's acted like a prick in all of this, the small excuses, not pulling his agent up on some of the shit he said, missing training. 


His age is no excuse really. I'm more pissed off that he never said anything in defence of Carra after his agent slated him. That would've healed a few wounds. Probably wouldn't have made the outcome any different but at least it would've shown that he's not a total gobshite.


Whatever the reason, he wanted to leave in the end and couldn't be persuaded otherwise, so, here we are. Let's not get this idea into our heads that he's not good enough for them or that he'll ruin his career, he won't. He's a hugely talented youngster and he'll only continue to improve. Good luck to him or whatever. For his own sake, he should learn from his experience though. He needs rid of that agent for a start and to mature a bit or he might have problems in the future. 


We need to look at ourselves too. We should have offered an improved contract this time last year. If we had, we might not be going through all of this right now. If Sterling were at another club and we were looking to buy him, we would have done everything we could to get him. Let's at least not make the mistake of not looking after what we have first. I don't want to see this repeated with Coutinho next year, or Sakho, Henderson, Ibe, Can, Firmino or whoever else in the coming years. Players have fragile egos and purely from a professional point of view, seeing Glen Johnson strut around on three times more than you must piss you off a bit. 


It's over now and mostly it's a huge shame that it's got to this point. I watched him score 5 past Southend as a 16y/o and it was hugely exciting. The opener against City in the title run. He was a player to be proud of. It makes little sense. He's not heading back to London, he probably will only move a few miles down the road. He's not off to one of the giants like Real Madrid or Bayern. He's gone to City. He'll do well, probably. Then likely go through the same thing in a few more years. Strange that Chelsea or Arsenal never followed up their interest either. In the end it was only City left.


The important thing is what we do. We'll likely spend all of the money on Benteke. He's a good player and will be useful but if you'd have asked anyone this time last year would you straight-swap Benteke for Sterling and they would have laughed.

&amp;nbsp; 

The answer to can we really claim to be challenging for the top 4 if we've just sold one of our best players to the competition?  Is dependent on two sub questions:

&amp;nbsp; 

1.  **Can we identify what constitutes our best player?**


2.**Is the quality of player we sold to a rival,  BETTER OR WORSE than their REPLACEMENT**


&amp;nbsp;

Now answer to 1. While stats don't obviously tell the full picture of who our best player is (See Iniesta for Barca) they are still a pretty useful indicator. 

Sterling at least till April  according to Neville basically carried our offense, he was **number 1**, in   a)assists, b)goals, and c) chances created. This suggests to me he was definitely one of our best players. By contrast Mata, had 0 goals for Chelsea, due to only 13 starts, he certainly wasn't one of the better players that season. 

&amp;nbsp; 

That brings us to point 2. Why Chelsea can still consider to be challenging despite selling their ""best "" player is because the **replacements** in Fabgregas, and Costa were awesome. 

Our track record of replacing talent, has been at best  mixed lol failing to idnetify the kind of players we need. Moreover, even if we identify the right players there is no guranttee they will hit the ground running. Could take a year to settle. 


&amp;nbsp;

tldr: Overall, it is **too early** to tell if we can claim to be challenging for the top 4 if we've sold one of our best players. This is because it depends on how well we **replace sterling**.  Chelsea sold Mata, but they had bought in fabregas. It's too early to see how our signings perform

If you vote or support Labour you are meant to have a different ideological viewpoint on politics and society than the Tories. For this reason alone you should be thinking of alternative strategies to proceed if you were in power. These methods should support your left-leaning ideological thought. Supporting child tax credit cuts is not left-leaning, it is right-leaning and therefore not in keeping with Labour views. 

Labour should be saying:

' X is our strategy for how we cut child tax credits but still support poor children. '

OR

' We do not support the cut on child tax credits because of X,Y Z and here is our plan to retain them / reform them ' 

Instead Harriet Harman is just coming out and saying 'Yeah we support the Tories plan'. Great strategy to get into power. Let's see how that works out...

null,false,WhatABiscuit,eu,European Union,null,"I meant my comment more with regards to the idea of a *large* eternal deficit. There is a difference between being modestly in debt and tied to the GDP (which indeed most countries are) and being so much in debt you cannot get any credit anywhere, which is what Greece has come down to. That is more what I meant in reaction to the 'massive deficit' comment.

What worries me and why I commented was because I feel there is a risk of the political right capitalising on 'doing the numbers right' while left at times is capitalising on 'money isn't real'. I am a socialist at heart but still want to count the beans, so to say. So perhaps I jumped the gun a little on this whole thing but it pains me to see people talk about money as-if it is meaningless, because in reality it is extremely meaningful and governs large aspects of our lives. We need to control that and put it to the service of people, not deny it.

I am more of the school of thought who says that if we invented money, it is existent, and it shall be existent until we un-invent it ;). There are many things of value which are 'not existent' yet hold value, and many of them a lot less specific than money. You are right that there is nothing that stops us from creating or destroying money, but there is also nothing stopping us from creating or destroying trees either. There are consequences to putting on the money printing press, in the end.

One wrote stuff on 2 tickets for us, took our £5, gave us verbal instructions, then pressed the button to raise the barrier. I don't know what the other guy was for. The bottleneck was due in part to that procedure, that I suspect could be streamlined, and also due to the single-server layout.

Yes, his views just so happen to be the sort of views we heard Foot say in the 80s ^(democracy dates back to several centuries BC, clearly that's irrelevant to today's politics!)

Yes, he's old ^(so is the Queen, often noted for her astuteness) and he's an outsider ^(aren't many people sick of seeing the political elite by now?) and he likes causes generally considered to be a bit unsympathetic ^(honestly I don't have a response to this, I need to look it up a bit more) to say the least.

But he's _different_.

He _isn't_ prepared to make Labour kneel down and beg forgiveness instead of picking itself up and going forwards.  He _isn't_ immediately saying yes, we'll have this cut, yes, we'll have this one, as if austerity is the only way forwards and just because the Tories set the agenda once means they can keep setting it.

We do need a little compromise and realism and maybe Jeremy isn't quite giving us that.  But for me it's him or it's a leader who almost seems to want the Tories to keep writing the agenda, who doesn't want to challenge the neoliberal consensus and austerity, who doesn't want to at least engage the electorate in a discussion about how this country might be better off with change.

Maybe tasking him with just defensive duties and allowing him to get forward only when we need everyone up or if we are possessing the ball will let him be a little more stable in midfield. After all, Barca played him at CB in a CL Final, so we know he can play defense, we just have to get him to. Even if we don't get Pogba, your 4-2-3-1 with Dinho instead of Pogba is a really solid XI.

Silva in an Iniesta type role (or Cazorla, as someone else mentioned) would be a really interesting idea. I feel like he could pull that off, since he is able to play any pass he wants and can dribble in a phone booth, but I would think it would be strange to base a transfer strategy on being able to convert Silva to a more defensive player. He's shown that he isn't really afraid of going in on a tackle and that he really isn't a bad tackler, so maybe it could work.

About 1.3 million people earned the old minimum wage and more than that will earn less than the living wage. If the ratio of unemployed to people who benefit was as high as one to ten, I would have qualms about it.

But you obviously have to look at the overall effect of all the measures the Tories took. The people who need the money most have lost twice what they've gained. So even though I've wanted a living wage for a long time, I'm not feeling overjoyed about its introduction, particularly as we still lose the 60,000 jobs even though it hasn't helped them.

Okay, I accept doing that doing it this way saves the country money because business pays for minimum wage whereas with tax credits meant that we were giving them a subsidy. Except it's not that simple. The government  gave business a cut in corporation tax to offset putting this cost onto them. 

However, business gets the tax cut whether their costs went up or not. So it will cost residential homes in the North more than they save on corporation tax, because most of their costs are paying wages to people who earn near the minimum wage.

Most young people didn't **need** access to higher education, and that is exactly my point, every form of education they did need was free of charge, for all, the building blocks to get a stable career were all there for free, even the building blocks to get a great career were there for free if you got into university. Now to even get a reasonable job, like they would have got straight out of O level, 3 years earlier, requires an undergrad degree costing £50K and 3 years of your life. All to get the same low end office job they got straight out of school, if you actually want a decent job these days you have to get an MSc, MBA, or one of the many other professionally certified accreditations out there and everyone does as soon as they hit the pay cap, in some lines of work it is higher up than others, and in many the jobs essentially don't exist without it.

I wouldn't be opposed to Pellegrini trying that out against West Brom to start the season. /u/Masterofknees mentioned him as playing an Iniesta role, and I think you guys are both kind of talking about the same role where a small, technical Spanish player is the main midfield attacking impetus. I think Silva could pull that off. Iniesta has the luxury of Busquets playing behind him, and Fernandinho could probably fill that role. Of course, Cazorla has Coquelin behind him, and I know Dinho can match his defensive production.

Both Barca and Arsenal like to use pretty dynamic box-to-box midfielders, like Rakitic and Ramsey, next to their Spanish playmakers, so I guess Yaya would fill that role, even though he struggled with it last year.

null,false,suzych,null,null,null,"As for niche viewing (SF), ""family"" viewing (kids and parents), and ""serious drama"", I'd say the first two definitely apply to US viewers, but I would also argue that there were quite strong elements of ""serious drama"" in S8, meant in part to appeal to more mature   viewers.  That is, fans who have been with the show for decades and who have ""aged out"" (to varying degrees) of the much younger majority (?); and fans who came in on NewWho as adult followers of David Tennant or, for those with a more romance-attuned interest, Matt Smith.  

S8 was, I think, unique in its emphasis on mature themes -- finding a new internal balance after a major ""life crisis""; adjusting to the changes that age forces into any long-term relationship; in general a look at the Doctor and his companion not as masters of Time, but as people used to playing with the stuff suddenly faced by the mastery that Time has over all of us, Lords and Ladies, ideas and environments alike.  For Clara, the challenge was what looked to me like what women in their twenties face, trying to figure out how to ""have it all"" (or, if not, which part of it to go for), while the Doctor's regeneration recovery looked like a cranked up mid-life crisis, which you normally don't have until you get to, well, mid-life.  The adolescent version is all about you and your parents and your peers, but the mid-life thing is you wrestling with your own life.

Steven M. says S9 is about ""consequences"", which sounds like the second part of a mid-life crisis: confronting and owning your past choices for what they were and what they meant (or refusing to, and getting ""stuck"" as a result), embedded in tear-away adventure.  

After that, who knows?  There is such a thing as a ""second childhood"" in older age.  S8-S9 could turn out to be an odd but significant detour, as a new wave of mostly quite young fans in Asia sweep the show back into ""youth audience"" + ""family viewing"" style.  We're always saying how Doctor Who keeps changing, so it should come as no surprise that the tone and content vary so much. In any event, it seems to me that having a Drama Department behind it is very sensible, for the more mature themes that run throughout but sometimes surface as central in themselves, as in these current Series.

A 1 bedroom will be slightly cheaper.

I know culturally (probably a lot to do with Thatcher) it is important here. It's often a good financial decision (I'll get to that later). But:

* 42% of people in London don't own their own homes. And there's no shame in that.

* [Wages have been stagnant, the cost of buying a house has gone up steeply](http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/guides/456900/456991/img/1163067349.gif).

The reason a house is usually a good use of money is a practical one. Let's say you try and save. Most months you'll save. But sometimes you decide 'screw it, I'm going on holiday'. If you're paying off a mortgage, that doesn't happen. You'll be forced to pay the mortgage. There are very few financial investments that people commit to month-in, month-out.

A stock ISA is like a regular ISA (i.e. tax free, but you can only put in £15k a year), but you own stocks and shares. Stocks and shares are considered riskier, but if you get a tracker (i.e. one that buys the average of the market) and you hold it for longer than 7 years, there are almost no periods in history when you would have lost money. If you hold it for 10 years, you'll definitely get your money back. If you hold it for 30 years, it'll be better than any other investment (at least historically that's mostly been the case). The main risk is that you decide to get the money out too early. Holding your money in a bank is considered 'safe' - but money loses value over time, so we have to let go of the supposed safeness of money (that said, you should always have a 5-10k emergency fund).

Anyway, consider it this way. If you decide to buy a house because you think it's a sound financial decision, you'll have to save for a few years and live with your mother. But it's really the other way around - saving for a few years is the sound financial decision, whether you decide to spend the money on a house or whether you decide to spend it on a savings account. Renting is sometimes a better choice than buying a house (particularly because you are young and single - as you said, you want to be flexible with regards to change).

It's really up to you what you want to do. I had to move out of home because living at home became untenable. It depends on what your relationship is like with your mother. Saving more is a good idea. Your salary is likely to go up with time (depending on what you do - if you're an athlete or a model, it's likely to decrease). Don't get freaked out by the whole 'I'm never going to be able to buy my own place'.

null,false,Axius,null,null,null,"I don't think Hunt is completely right on what Labour needs to do, and is too involved with the internals of the party.

The problem with the Labour Party right now is how it has associated media portrayal too closely with electoral success. Granted some consciousness of what the media is saying matters, but Labour has got too involved with this in the wrong way, as if they seek to manipulate what the media is saying.

It has avoided confronting the agenda set out by the Tories and the perception is that they are avoiding the topic of the deficit because they know that the Tories are right - this is why they are in trouble. People don't know why Labour is not defending itself or it's record.

Labour has also since failed to defend any of the positives of Gordon Brown's/Tony Blair's time as PM and still seems to be doing so as much as they can to avoid the deficit question - the fact John Prescott mentioning something positive was almost headline news confirms this. In turn they also failed to defend Miliband whilst the media was attacking him, instead opting to question whether another leader was better, reinforcing in the public that their leader was not suitable to run the country.

Along with this has been a desire to emulate Blair amongst all potential leadership candidates. This approach is making the problems worse, the public face of the party has no real character as nobody dares to say anything that could be a negative headline quote. 

This all makes the party no different to the Conservatives - why would anyone have confidence in a soulless party that can't even tell you what positives they have achieved and would achieve if you voted for them? Labour is placing too much on the party leader and less on the actual party. 

When you offset this against what the Tories are offering right now - People can actually name various members of the Conservative cabinet, they even had two former leaders of the opposition involved. Would Labour be able to do this in power? I have doubts.

If Corbyn is capable of listening to other perspectives that differ to his, as a leader rather than a pseudo-celebrity, he honestly could be the only opportunity to break the trend Labour are establishing that is cementing their fate. Labour needs to be more than just a party saying 'we are not Tories'.

I learnt a lot from that course, and though it may not be your thing - I cannot recommend seeking out similar courses or programs in your area, in conjunction with therapy and/or a different medication.

As a hard but good first step, and it will take a ton of willpower, is to try your hardest to pull through with going to work, maybe even incentivising yourself with a treat or something to look forward to afterwards. It is absolutely fine to be nervous with a new job (it'd be a little strange if you weren't!), and with added anxiety issues on top, it will be doubly hard. But when you get through that, the feeling of knowing that you lived with your emotions is just amazing. I also cannot recommend enough, breathing techniques to relax and calm yourself, with information found throughout the internet.

However, there is an offence of aggravated trespass that could be applicable, in the following circumstances, contrary to [section 68](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/section/68) of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994*. 

&gt; (1) A person commits the offence of aggravated trespass if he trespasses on land and, in relation to any lawful activity which persons are engaging in or are about to engage in on that or adjoining land, does there anything which is intended by him to have the effect—

&gt; (a) of intimidating those persons or any of them so as to deter them or any of them from engaging in that activity,

&gt; (b) of obstructing that activity, or

&gt; (c) of disrupting that activity.

If found guilty, OP could be jailed for up to three months and/or fined £2,500.

As far as putting a blueprint together for UCL success - it's impossible. It's knockout competition with poor structure, there's no way to properly prepare for it. We've had far better teams that 2012 that didn't even reach the final, and 2012 was arguably one our our weakest teams int he last decade. 

The proper way to go out is to build a team for sustained success in the league and make sure you have the balance and tools to handle whatever comes at you in Europe, and to take advantage of the opportunities if/when the come your way.

Hoping that we somehow are ""better' when we win the next UCL is ridiculous, it takes something special to win a competition of that magnitude. What does anyone care that may not have had the most skilled team in Europe when we won it? We and history will remember winning it, that's all that matters.

I've posted a few times this last week about basically just this. The jist of those posts were, because both my parents work fulltime and have stayed married over the years. As fully paying taxpayers their entire life, they and their children (me and my siblings) were entitled to literally nothing. 

My parents are not rich, they are not poor, they are int he middle zone, they make just enough to be given zero handouts and not enough to splash out cash on themselves or their kids. 

As such, myself and my siblings were not entitled to a single benefit during our education. Grants? No, EMA? No, Student loans? Bare minimum only. 

I've, along with many of supposed millions of others (although I've yet to encounter a single one) have been through higher education with no help from to he government at all. I've had the additional financial stress during my studies that other students haven't had to endure, simply because they have parents who are separated, or don't work, or sick or w/e other reason. 


Point in all this is yes, I agree with you:

&gt;if the policies discourage people from working more.

From what I've learnt in my 27 years of life in the UK, it's either be born rich. Be extremely successful. Or don't bother working at all. Because if you don't make it big, you're literally better off financially for you and your kids to not bother with employment.

Personally i don't mind which of these we get and i would be happy to see different names of a similar quality in that mix. We need a proven goal scorer - not a championship goal scorer, not a Ligue Un or MLS goal scorer, an EPL goal machine.

Remy will be fine and suits our speed, Austin will be equally fine despite his different, Murray esque qualities.

-Sakho's ban will be one match.

-Angelo wasn't the only CB we were after, but is the one we ended up signing.

-Jenkinson will sign Monday or Tuesday.

-Glenn Johnson was never a target.

-We are weighing up a player + cash move that QPR offered us for Austin: Jarvis + Nolan + Cash ... though the cash sounds significant enough for the club to be hesitant.

-Stewart Downing ""very likely"" to leave.

-We are looking for a winger as well... two we are keen on are Townsend and Mirallas.

-We are also interested in unearthing another Sakho (French-African Striker) in Paul-Georges Ntep or Max Gradel.

-Also looking at a couple Danes who couldn't be more different physically: Yussuf Poulsen (6'5 forward) and Pione Sisto (5'7 midfielder).

-Alex Song transfer is sorted with Barca, we're just waiting to see the timetable for his recovery before agreeing.

Honestly though, he's been our best kept secret since he's been here. Last year I thought he was better than Morgan tbh but didn't get the plaudits he deserved because he's so raw. 

I share the concerns about depth too though. I rate Reed pretty highly, and I feel like the club does as well, or we wouldn't have sold Cork, but even two pure DMs isn't a lot. I don't think JWP or Davis are really capable of playing there, and now that Toby's gone there goes our other option.

I could honestly see us doing something like this if we get all the big 3 we've been after:

Zaba/backup - Komps/Demi - Manga/Denayer - Clichy/backup

...............................Nando/Dinho

............De Bruyne/Nasri-----------Pogba/Yaya

Sterling/Navas----------Aguero/Bony--------------Silva/De Bruyne

De Bruyne can provide creative cover for our left wing, as well as a central mid spot. I think this would also be benefitial, because of the fluidity of the squad - we'd easily be able to change it up between 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1, and the occasional 4-4-2 if we're looking to give Nacho or Enes a go up top. The fact that de bruyne could start on the wing or central opens up opportunities for Lopez to slot in at times too.

Personally, I think lining up like this, as long as we always start a solid defensive player at the base of midfield, (i.e. don't put yaya or pogba there) would make us a really strong force to be reckoned with.

null,false,MouMoneyMouProblem,null,null,null,"&gt; If he played very well, how is that debatable? 

Because you said he was *the best outfield player on the pitch*, you can both play very well and not be the best. And lets put that performance into context as well, Mikel was extremely well protected in the middle of the pitch, our left winger was a left back! We rarely ventured forward in great numbers, and largely gave up possession of the ball to Bayern. Defensive players jobs become a lot easier when there is less space to cover, it reminds me of people sucking off Kalas for his performance against Liverpool when we essentially had a back 6 for most of the game. And please don't say things like ""go back and rewatch and see what he brought to the game"", it's an extremely condescending statement. 


&gt; As far as putting a blueprint together for UCL success - it's impossible. It's knockout competition with poor structure, there's no way to properly prepare for it. We've had far better teams that 2012 that didn't even reach the final, and 2012 was arguably one our our weakest teams int he last decade. 


My point is using Mikel in 2012 is a poor argument in repsonse to what the other guy said. He's talking about Chelsea being one of the absolute best teams, on par with Madrid/Barcelona and Bayern, and he's saying Mikel wouldn't play for those teams (which I personally agree with). Using that Champions League run as an argument against that statement is foolish in my opinion, it's not as though we won it by being the best team in Europe. 


&gt; Hoping that we somehow are ""better' when we win the next UCL is ridiculous, it takes something special to win a competition of that magnitude. What does anyone care that may not have had the most skilled team in Europe when we won it? We and history will remember winning it, that's all that matters.


I'm sorry, exactly why is aspiring to be the best side in Europe ridiculous? And I strongly disagree with your last comment, winning isn't all that matters. Football is entertainment, it isn't life or death (^much^more^important^than^that). Imagine getting to watch a Chelsea team that goes down in history as one of the greatest sides ever, for instance. That's the dream. Equally the better the team/squad is the greater the chance of winning it again quite honestly, although our sample size doesn't show it you've more chance winning the Champions League if you're the best team in Europe than if you're finishing 6th in your domestic league!

Not everyone had standout games; if he was among the best, he's certainly in the conversation as being the best we had for 120 minutes. I don't care that we aligned defensively and he may have had extra help in spot - he was still the most vital midfield cog defensively in the formation and he went out and executed what he had to do extremely well. If it's condescending for me to say go back and re-watch his role, then deal with it because it will provide greater enlightenment as to what he did well that night and his value to us, particularly in big matches.

2) I have no idea what you are going on about in regards to Mikel not being able to play for Bayern, Barca, Real except that I agree he wouldn't with their current managers. I also recognize there's players that Mourinho wouldn't field from those teams for Chelsea as well. It comes down to a manager's preference as well as talent - Mikel could fit into those three clubs but wouldn't do to philosophical reasons, what's that have anything to do with whether or not he plays well for us?

3) There's nothing wrong with being the best side in Europe and aspiring to do so if you're not. But the Champions League is not the benchmark for overall long term success for any club, and certainly not the competition you look at when going out to build your team, which you've agreed with above (you're more likely to win the better domestic side you are.)

I think your dream differs from mine; I can remember watching some truly awful Chelsea clubs and never imagining we've had a European Cup in our cabinet, much less a chance to compete for it every single year. My entertainment is seeing this team wins, no matter how they do it, and reveling in the fantastic atmosphere and philosophy this club stands for year after year. I still think you're trying to minimize how we won the Champions League because ""we weren't the best club"" that season, and I think that's fucking horrible. We fucking won it, a lot of other good clubs haven't, and the way in which we did it was this fantastic culmination of this 9 year journey which showed us some truly memorable moments (good and bad) that led to Munich. 

We don't have to be all conquering heroes to win it ""better"" (BTW, we didn't lose a single game in Europe this season, and look at where that got us in the end,) we simply go out and do the best we can and if it happens, it happens. History and supporters are going to make the determinations for the best team that year anyway regardless of whom takes home the trophy, we don't need it to solidify our stature or to improve upon what was 2012.

To throw you and others under the bus a bit, it's sad that there exists this wanton culture of selfishness and egotistical belief behind the club that's largely been brought about by recent success. Unfortunately, it's not a generational thing either. Plenty of new fans and old supporters have it I'm afraid, and it really shames the great support that we have when these people expect that we win everything and sign every player imaginable and won't settle for anything less. Constructive opinion is great but the level of assumed dominance in the Chelsea community spreading like wildfire just makes me sick.

I don't know why this is the case, tax is very very complicated, but it was just an observation. If we could somehow change our tax system to get revenue as efficiently as they do, we could afford everything we do now, but with much lower taxes. 

EDIT: Most people in America don't pay 17% tax though, that was just the bottom 20% of earners.

&gt;vets would disagree with you

&gt;http://www.vet-wildlifemanagement.org.uk/images/stories/item-images/pdf/VetOpinion.pdf

&gt;""As members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons we submit therefore that hunting by hounds is the natural and most humane way of controlling the population of all four quarry species, fox, deer, hare and mink, in the countryside. Humane, since at all times the wild animal remains in its natural environment and the relatively short period of physiological stress that may be suffered in the final phase of the hunt, followed by the almost instantaneous kill must be the preferred method of culling a wild animal. Hunting produces no wounded survivors. Hunting is the only method of culling that selectively maintains the health and vigour of the species and which allows the quarry species respite during the breeding season. Hunting is environmentally friendly to both the quarry species and to other wildlife. It is the natural, balanced, biological method of controlling wildlife, proven over centuries.""

Now I am not saying hunting for fun is acceptable at all, I don't agree that fox hunting for fun with dogs should be allowed. But then again, a knee jerk reaction based on the (often perceived) violence and horror of fox hunting with dogs isn't all that helpful either. And I am saying this as someone who has a few family members involved in countryside management and I myself have studied countryside management aplenty, though never worked in it.

Fact is that there is no clear consensus on how best to kill a fox when it is needed (for various reasons), but there is a sizeable section of professionals involved within the field who are actually suggesting hunting with dogs is a far more humane way of killing the animal when compared to trapping and shooting. 

Again, this does not mean I support hound hunting for fun. ",null,0,null,1436738972,null,0,1436739492,0,ct12ix1,null,t3_3d03d4,null,t1_ct12ix1,null,t1_ct11ir2,null,null,null,1437802952,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

Everyone got shafted by the £9000 fees imo except the unis. There's no discernible impact on taxation of the general public afaik, no benefit to the government, and obviously no benefit to current students who end up paying back far more than previous generations.

They have an old pet dog who they've had since he was a pup and decided to take him with them.


They had full marina training and after a year decided to sail off.


They went to all the ports around Ireland and docked exploring Galway, Cork and Donegal.


Eventually they decided to go over to the Isle of man and half way through had to put their training into practice.


The water was extremely choppy and they were battling against huge waves and gusting winds.


In the spare of the moment the dog jumped off the starboard deck and into the water.


The couple tried their best efforts to save the dog but the water was too choppy and eventually they had to navigate to the nearest port in Douglas.

The wee dog was well trained and they loved it to pieces, they'd lost it before on a number of occasions but it always made it's way back home.

It's a celebration of history and a good day out for the family really.

Are these people ensuring no harm comes to their homes or themselves? Because if it is themselves then it is extremely counter productive. If it is there homes don't be fucking stupid. The morning is mainly just the orangemen and bands who aren't going to break ranks to attack houses in broad daylight in front of the police? Even the people marching alongside the OO are on one side of the road and the Police are everywhere, there is NO WAY they would even get to the other side. Nevermind the houses which 
might I add are behind the fucking shops...

And the worst thing is the residents group has ""Called for people from far and wide"" so a good portion of the protesters aren't even from Ardoyne?

Let's also put a few points down in favour of the parade. Apart from the twelfth no longer being a sectarian celebration for the majority of people I can also say that:

1. The Parade goes by on a drumbeat. So it isn't incredibly loud for the residents, yes some noise but you know.

2. The houses are behind the shops,  people literally can't see the parade from there as far as I can tell. There is no way their houses could be hit. 

3. People basically have to come out and watch the parade to be offended, it's not a kick the pope song its a drum beat and the parade isn't visible from the residential area of Ardoyne.

Moreover, the Police have zero interest in actually enforcing it (because they have a list of more important things to deal with - murder, manslaughter, assaults, domestic abuse, child abuse, robberies, burglaries, copper theft wiping out power to sections of railway - they literally don't give a shit about a handful of foxes).

Consider, fox hunting wasn't banned (perfectly legal for someone to go out and shoot, poison or trap foxes), and hunting *with dogs* was only partially banned - the hunts simply carry a firearm because it was accepted that if they were out drag hunting and the hounds picked up a real scent, they might well follow the real scent. Since it would be extremely difficult to break them from the chase once they had a scent, they carry a firearm to shoot the fox with rather than allowing the dogs to kill it.

Now go to a court and *prove* that the hunt deliberately put the dogs onto the real scent. *Prove* that they weren't really drag hunting, or that they didn't make a best effort to break off the hunt.

It broadly impossible to prove.

In 10 years, literally a couple of private prosecutions have been brought by the likes of the RSPCA at *vast* expense. I know a vet who now won't deal with the RSPCA - he handed them clear, documented evidence of hare coursing and other illegal, organised animal abuse activities - they said a prosecution would be ""too difficult"" and turned him away, presumably because prosecuting some pikeys for running dog fights wasn't sexy enough - they wanted to hit the headlines taking on the ""toffs in red suits"". They then blew £250k pursuing a hunt who had killed a fox, with the net result the huntmaster was fined £3k. That's not value for money, or even a terribly great deterrant to those considering breaking the law deliberately (rather than just because the dogs ot away from them). Funnily enough quite a lot of people stopped donating to the RSPCA after that because they thought their local rescue shelters were less likely to piss their donations away and more likely to spend it on *animal welfare*.

It's a bad law because it's difficult, if not impossible to enforce, and UK Law Enforcement has zero interest in even *attempting* to enforce it^1. Moreover, it was brought in to distract from the Iraq war, and whilst the campaign may have started with animal welfare at it's heart, it devolved pretty rapidly into a class war against the perceived ""toffs"" (clue: anyone can put a red jacket on. Go to any student grad ball and they'll all be in tuxedos. Doesn't make them all toffs or James Bond, as much as they might like to think the latter).

^1 When the law came in, my uncle was still a Police Officer (now retired). A second cousin (definitely not a toff) rode out with the hunt. We joked that we'd love to see him try to arrest her, to which she retorted ""I'd like to see him try"". As would we. It would be hilarious.

He pointed out that he would never get as far as trying because (aside from valuing his dignity and unbroken bones), he would elsewhere, busy investigating a theft of farm machinery (which was depriving a farmer of their livelihood). Or following up on the lad that beat up his girlfriend the previous weekend, or supporting the local ferry port on a drugs bust - serious crimes that affect people's lives. His under-staffed Station had no resource to waste on irrelevencies such as whether a fox was shot, poisoned or had it's neck broken by a pack of dogs.

It's not that he was refusing to enforce a law of the land - he'd just never *get* to it because it would *always* be buried under far more important cases. It would *literally* be at the very bottom of the pile.",null,0,null,1436739869,null,0,1436740875,0,ct131ay,null,t3_3d10wn,null,t1_ct131ay,null,t1_ct10ubr,null,null,null,1437803299,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

I know it's like someone else is running your thoughts sometimes, and you want nothing more than a quick solution or answer to the crippling feeling, but try to remember that it is possible to feel normal again, you just have to be really strong and patient and take one step at a time to get there.

So, for your problem, imagine you saw the doctor about a bad knee the other day. He says, OK, easily fixed, take these pills. Today though, you wake up and your knee is swollen, and very painful, and you're struggling to walk. Would you pass that off and say you don't want to be a bother, I'll leave it a while.

You didn't claim he was *arguably* the best on the night, you said he was. I said it was debatable, which you then questioned how it was debatable, now you're back tracking and saying he was arguably the best. Lets just put that to rest now. 


&gt; then deal with it because it will provide greater enlightenment as to what he did well that night and his value to us


This assumption that I haven't watched the game, or somehow haven't watched closely enough to gain the amazing insight that you have. It's nauseating and it's poor arguing. You are unable or unwilling to put into words your opinion so as a cop out you just say ""oh go watch again and you'll see I'm right"". Ultimately I'm not sure what point you're even trying to make, I already said in my very first post on this issue that Mikel played very well that night. 


&gt; what's that have anything to do with whether or not he plays well for us?


Feel we're going off on a tangent with the talk of Madrid, Bayern and Barca, but it's a comment about Mikel's quality and his limitations. I would argue that largely Mikel *doesn't* play that well for us. As I said elsewhere in this topic there is a noticeable drop off in how well the team plays when Matic is out and Mikel is in, and that Mikel is a fantastic player for when we're defending deep and in numbers, but that it is rare for us to be needing to do that. I'm not talking about wanting Chelsea to be Barcelona lite, but lets just say I want more of away at [Man City from two seasons ago](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25908324) than [at home to Man United this season](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32262278), hopefully you remember the two games to understand my point. 


&gt; I still think you're trying to minimize how we won the Champions League because ""we weren't the best club"" that season, and I think that's fucking horrible. 


I'm not trying to minimise anything, I'm just calling a spade a spade. The achievement was arguably Chelsea's greatest, but the team was not. 


&gt; To throw you and others under the bus a bit, it's sad that there exists this wanton culture of selfishness and egotistical belief behind the club that's largely been brought about by recent success. Unfortunately, it's not a generational thing either. Plenty of new fans and old supporters have it I'm afraid, and it really shames the great support that we have when **these people expect that we win everything and sign every player imaginable and won't settle for anything less**. Constructive opinion is great but the level of assumed dominance in the Chelsea community spreading like wildfire just makes me sick.


As for this, it's just utter tripe. Typical super fan bollocks. I've not seen anyone acting like that, and I certainly haven't been either. People wanting the best for the club and wanting to compete at the highest level is not expecting to win everything and sign every player. Most people want one 'good' signing this summer, they aren't calling for a rebuild of the team and hundreds of millions of pounds spent. People want Chelsea to be the best because the club quite clearly has the potential to be. There's a great team currently, probably top 5~ in the world, there's arguably the best manager in the world, and there's the finances, training facilities, academy, coaches and physios to compete with the best clubs in Europe.

The other thing though is it doesn't work. The amendment seems to be to allow flushing with dogs, which is the same as in Scotland.

This is eminently sensible because it already happens. If a pack is out drag hunting and picks up a real scent, they will sometimes follow the real scent if it is stronger than the artificial scent. Hunts carry  a firearm so they shoot the fox (entirely legally), before the dogs kill it. 

It's broadly impossible for a prosecution to be brought showing either that the huntmaster deliberately sent the dogs off on the new (real) trail, or that they didn't do everything within their power to call the dogs off. I don't believe any criminal prosecution has been brought - only private prosecutions where the test of guilt is ""balance of probabilities"" rather than ""beyond reasonable doubt"".

If you're going to continue drag hunting (and the hunts will - you can't ban drag hunting without banning people from taking their dogs out for a walk in the countryside!), then you also have to accept the dogs may on occasion pick up a real scent, and the law needs to allow for the fact that the dogs are animals following their instincts, so long as the hunt uses a firearm where possible to end it as quickly as is safe and practicable.",null,0,null,1436741270,null,0,false,0,ct13t0u,null,t3_3d10wn,null,t1_ct13t0u,null,t1_ct11j3s,null,null,null,1437803962,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Yeah maybe at the moment we're down some players, but we're buying well (thanks for Milner by the way...), and we still have yet to lock down a striker, which we will do. We'll be in form again soon, no worries at all. Until then I'll be standing by supporting the club with vigor and pride, like the millions upon millions of others just like me around the globe.

I agree, but it's not a new problem. The last 5 years Labour were in opposition they always seemed to just say ""that won't work"" and never come up with or offer up solutions. This was brought into stark contrast during the election with very few policies that seemed to offer solutions, and so never resonated with the public apart from their core base.

I think people here don't realise that the ideology they themselves have for the Left is not really represented by the Labour party, or at least it is definitely not projected to the voters. I can agree with many ""left-wing"" things people here say, but I don't see the Labour party as representative of those ideas, nor do they seem to want to be. People were unhappy and wanted change (I mean improvement to their circumstances, not in the general country's direction), Labour didn't seem to offer much hope of that and you're right, with statements like this they still don't seem to be.

null,false,DasSnaus,US,usa,null,"&gt; winning isn't all that matters. Football is entertainment, it isn't life or death (muchmoreimportantthanthat). Imagine getting to watch a Chelsea team that goes down in history as one of the greatest sides ever, for instance. That's the dream.

I'm self righteous? We've just done the double, won the league in 35 games, lost 4 fucking matches all season, went undefeated in Europe (unfortunately out) and you're talking about how our team that won the European Cup wasn't entertaining enough?

And then, you've got the stones to throw around this ""typical super fan bollocks"" when you're going on about a few ""poor results"" here and there and how entertaining our teams are when they win things.

When were we not entertaining? Certainly not the first half of the season we were whipping everyone and were the most entertaining team in the country? If you want a European giant in football housed at SW6, wouldn't it make sense to have a team that could play football of different styles? One that can put up 5 at Swans away and drag out a needed 0-0 at home against Man United to secure points before the title. That's the mark of a great team for me - able to get results against any opponent. Seems your username namesake agrees as well, according to this interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z24JB3RYV_Q

I've pointed out multiple times that the 2012 side was one of the weakest sides we've had in Europe for over 10 years - I'd probably rank it in the bottom 2 TBH. But what the team lacked in talent it had in heart, experience and ruthless determination. Does that disqualify them from being the best? Is it not entertaining to watch a team go through all of those struggles and come out on top?

We are an English team in the Premier League. My reasonable expectation is that we go out every single season and compete for the title, and I could care less how we do it. As far as expecting anything else in the cups, it cannot be guaranteed and it's gravy - go out and compete in the league and the rest will come.

The other two CMs (Toure, Fernandinho, Pogba) would be tasked with both combining in defense and controlling space when the opposition has the ball, and with the freedom to one or both roam forward depending on the situation on offense. If Yaya can be coached to care about his defensive responsibilities, he can be a great player in this role. I imagine that while Silva will stay focused on building attack in the midfield and one of the Ferns will stay focused on defensive shape, Yaya can switch between the two according to play. This will require a better defensive effort than he showed last year, but I assume his clear understanding of that and commitment to it was key to his staying around this summer.

We've just done the double, won the league in 35 games, lost 4 fucking matches all season, went undefeated in Europe (unfortunately out) and you're talking about how our team that won the European Cup wasn't entertaining enough?


Hah, how the fuck have you managed to connect all of that together? You also shouldn't put things in quotation marks that aren't quotes. I don't believe I've used the phrase poor results, or even talked about poor results, in this entire discussion. You seriously need to stop making shit up like your previous post talking about how ""people expect that we win everything and sign every player imaginable."" 


Quite honestly you seem to have completely missed my point when talking about the quality of the side that won the Champions League. All I was saying is that using Mikel's performance in one of the worst Chelsea sides of the Abramovich era in one game, even the biggest game, is not an adequate argument for his quality. 


&gt; I'm not talking about wanting Chelsea to be Barcelona lite, but lets just say I want more of away at [Man City from two seasons ago](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25908324) than [at home to Man United this season](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32262278), hopefully you remember the two games to understand my point. 


I'm going to go back to this as I think it sums up my opinion well. Of course I'm not expecting Chelsea to play every game the same way, and I'm also not expecting Chelsea to win every game 5-0. What I do want to see more of is the devastating and exciting counter attacking football from that Man City game rather than the rather limp and overly cautious football against Man United (and PSG for that matter which along with poor set piece defending got us knocked out). Mikel as a player is far more suited to the latter than the former. Somehow in your eyes this makes me part of a ""culture of selfishness and egotistical belief behind the club.""

I know Liverpool fans are probably salty now that they've been surpassed (Don't worry I'd probably be too). But there's no need to come to other subs and embarrass yourself.

&gt; Because we're Liverpool.

And this Liverpool did what over the past 25 years? One champions league and a couple domestic cups. The way you're talking about this, 'precious and glorious' club you would think you'd have at least 10 of each. You have completely deluded yourself to such a point that it's entertaining. You are perfectly displaying the attitude of the stupid, little, arrogant shithead that everyone knows Liverpool fans are.

&gt; I'll be standing by supporting the club with vigor and pride, like the millions upon millions of others just like me around the globe.

Guess what, EVERY FUCKING CLUB HAS MILLIONS OF FOREIGN FANS. It's what happens when you're displayed around the world. Though I'll tell you what, it doesn't matter how many Koreans watch your club. It doesn't matter how many Liverpool fans go on the internet and brag about trophies from before they were born. What matters is that the two most important pieces of your club, the goalscoring and energy (Suarez) and the leadership (Gerrard) are both gone. I mean just look at your team and show me a player who would even start at City.

OK bear with me. Tax revenues as a percentage of GDP should not be directly linked to the income that tax payers get, as far as I can see. GDP is just a measure of how much money swapped between people and businesses, rather than the amount people earn.

So take two imaginary countries with equal GDP, but in one the higher earners contribute a lot more, as a percentage, to the tax take. Give them a bit lower tax rates as well. They should be able to produce the same tax revenue as a percentage of GDP as the other country even though tax rates are lower.

This misses a very key point. If university has been successful for you and you become a high earner due to it you already pay considerably more in income tax than someone who does not meet the threshold to pay back the loan. Infact the taxation from those earning less than 21k is negligible. This in effect means you get taxed twice for going to university with an increase in income tax and the repayment of loans. 

I also dislike the way it normalises being in debt. It starts the entire generation off borrowing money and being in debt. Likes take the average professional couple. They go to university each accruing somewhere in the region of £50k of student debt. They save up a bit and buy a modest house say £150k and before you know it they're starting a family from a position of £250k in debt. This is not an encouragement to finical responsibility and in my opinion leeds to a lot of the issues of poor personal finance management.

I recently started at a job where I have to wear a headset and have to answer a call with a second's notice (a buzz in my ear warns me). The first three weeks I had panic attacks in the bathroom before starting work, knowing I would have to experience the same anxiety for 7.5 hours a day five days a week. A month and a bit later the anxiety still gives me digestive issues on particularly bad days which shaken me somewhat.

What will happen is you will muddle through it and sometimes have bad moments (don't panic *now*) and you will go home with a little tremor yet massively relieved and will be more prepared for the next day where you will have to subject yourself to it again and again. I sometimes walked passed the lifts at work and wondered what would happen if I just hopped in, took the lift down and fucked off out the entrance. I'd move to the coast and go by the name of Francis or whatever but at least I'd be gone *now*. Then I'd walk through the doors to my office and back at work I am, no time to pause.

If you're really worried, try seeing if you can shadow someone for a few days to get a decent idea of what you'll be doing and ""learn the script"" i.e. what you say, how you respond, how you stall. 

In my job I have to bullshit a *lot* but it's not really bullshitting, it's diversion i.e. this is the problem, here is how I'm going to try and fix it - here's the script I say when I want to get rid of you to sort this out.

But theeen, with Capaldi's Doctor, we've seen her actually develop. Her personal life conflicting with her life with the Doctor was nicely explored, we saw the strain on her personally, her relationships and her job.

The way they both parted ways on a lie at the end of Death in Heaven just seemed to work for me? I'd have liked Clara's run to have ended there.
Not going to lie, I am a little bit interested in seeing how the Doctor and Clara's relationship is going to evolve throughout series 9, but I really don't think she can stay for *another* series. 
Moffat just needs to realise that sometimes you gotta drop something before it ruins itself.

This is ludicrous at 18 years old my parents have no legal responsibility for me and I am no longer there dependent. Their income should have no impact on my finances. 

Personally I was very lucky and my parents where generous enough to fund me through university. However had they not been willing I would of had to live entirely independently from them for 2 years before being eligible for more than the lowest loan and no grants what so ever. I wouldn't be eligible for council housing unless my parents kicked me out of the house and even then I'd need to find work or live off benefits for those 2 years. Benefits which wouldn't kick in for 8weeks leaving me homeless and penniless for 2 whole months. Under cameron proposals for no benefits for the under 25 with his scheme of in education or work I have no idea how this would work. I would literally be in a position of no benefits no housing and no way to fund university for 2 years.

I do not exaggerate to say could not afford university. The amount of loan I was eligible for did not even cover the cost of the cheapest hall of residence at my university or rent in town.

This could go on forever, so probably best that we end it here. If you require a more clear, concise understanding of my opinion here it is: regardless of how long you've been supporting the team, I think you're a tactically clueless, unreasonable fan. I think that you want to support the best club in Europe to say that you do, but have no idea how to actually get there, much less what that title would even mean. Hence, your reliance on UCL performance as some sort of indicative benchmark of how good a team is when in reality it's a poor grade for measuring the champion of European club football.

I think that it's easy to bitch in July about the last season and point to results where we didn't play well, but I also think that you didn't give a single fuck about that on 3rd May 2015, or how well or how poorly we played on 12th May 2012 - you celebrated like everyone else. I think in retrospect you probably look at how Barcelona won last year and are jealous of how the media adored them for their Treble season, even though it means fuck all to Chelsea supporters and will never change the great history that we have.

I think when it comes to Mikel, you take his skills for granted because they are harder to see, which is why a managre like Jose values him in the side and fans like you bitch about why he cannot move the ball forward more in the attacking third. It's my belief that Jose probably has a better resume than you when it comes to these matters.

And if you needed a better example of ""culture of selfishness and egotistical belief behind the club,"" keep checking this subreddit for the 20 daily topics complaining about why we aren't signing players, when are we going to sign someone, and whining about our rivals making signings while we are standing pat.

Fernando has been looking better as the season has gone on but isn't at the level we require, and we can't rely on Yaya to have another super season like he did 2 years ago. Plus if we play 4-3-3 we'd only have 3 centre mids for the centre 3, and no back up.

Get a DM now, and then worry about KDB if any offers come in for nasri or navas. But with nasri saying he is staying, and Pellers seeming to really like having navas in the squad.

The point being made is that when you look into our own history then you start to see similar injustices carried and continued across the world. The countries that are the most vocal critics of ISIS also incidentally make the weapons they use to kill,  and quite happily export them around the world.

Hey, I'm a doc. *Never* feel stupid about going back, seriously.

If you feel the citalopram isn't helping now, ask about swapping to another AD; there are a few effective alternatives and we really wanna see you get better, so *never feel stupid* about going and asking for advice if you don't feel too great.

Also, it's important to keep in mind that ADs aren't curative as such - they alter the brains chemistry so as to make you feel *less* bad, but this doesn't attack the cause of your bad feeling. The real end point in treating anxiety/depression is to have you back to a point where you feel comfortable and as happy as possible within yourself; the tablets merely facilitate this journey.

Go back to your doctor and tell him how you feel, ask if you can switch tablets if you like, but make sure you ask about CBT (this will usually be done through a referral to psychology/psychiatry). Cognitive behaviour therapy is *fantastic* and absolutely, 100% worth a shot.

Sorry if this post isn't too helpful it's pretty late and I've been travelling all day, but if I can help with anything else please do just ask. 

Never feel stupid.

At first glance, Sterling's tally of six Premier League goals this season might not seem particularly high but he's the only player yet to celebrate his 21st birthday to have found the net more than once. He's also the only player under the age of 23 to have delivered seven assists or more, ranking seventh overall in the top flight.

&gt;Sterling has created 62 chances from open play. That puts him third behind Eden Hazard and David Silva, but more tellingly the closest player younger than him is Adnan Januzaj with less than a quarter of that number. Sterling has also completed 83 dribbles, behind only Hazard and Alexis Sanchez, and there is nobody at the same age that has come up with more than 20 of them.

&gt;There is no player in La Liga aged 21 or under that has completed even half as many dribbles as Sterling this season. Likewise, there is no player in La Liga aged 21 or under that has created half as many chances as Sterling this season. As in all of Europe's five major leagues, the players with more assists are all older than him.

&gt;That's better reading.

My personal opinion of citalopram is just not to bother with it. Its only a temporary solution if at all.. I tried beta blockers too and ended up in A&amp;E with the biggest panic attack of my life.

Anxiety is a problem in your brain and the only thing that can truly fix it is your brain!

Things that helped me:

- Gym (lifting weights.. Took a lot of courage to start but now I realise all those 'meat heads' are genuinely really nice and don't care in the slightest if you look like you're new to the gym)

- a book called how to win friends and influence people. If talking to people is a struggle for you then this book will change your life.

- CBT is really brilliant.

- Meditation. I used an app called headspace. I don't meditate anymore (not really sure why) 
but it did help for sure.

- Avoiding sugar (can't emphasize enough how much this helps me).

As I said before feel free to pm me.. Its nice just to chat to someone sometimes who knows exactly what it feels like.

2) A nice appartment slightly out of town (20-30 mins) you would look to pay around £500-£600 by yourself without gas/electric. You could pay for a room in city center for around £250-£300 if you were living with other people. 

3) Is public transport affordable and easily accessible?

3) I don't know a lot about trains but buses are grand and you pay around £3.50 a day and you can travel as many times as you like on a bus.

When people hunt they follow the hounds on horseback at some distance. If there is a kill (and often there isn't) then the people riding out are generally not there when it happens.

It's also a huge misconception that people who go hunting are the very richest in society. It attracts a cross-section of society. There are a lot of country folk and very few of them are the 'very richest' in society.

My personal theory is that it was not a coincidence that the Cyber-Brig was anywhere near the plane in the first place - Missy arranged the whole thing and had the Brig unknowingly armed with a teleport device precisely for this occasion, knowing that he would be the most likely to shoot should it come down to it.

Alternatively, since she had a device that ultimately allowed one to physically return from the nethersphere, you might wonder if that was the only device?

Muscles and hormones have nothing to do with it. It's weight related and that's all there is to it. Yes, if you have more muscle mass you can eat more, but that's because your weight went up. Gain the same amount of weight in fat and your calories will go up as well. Hormones... Nothing do do with it at all. Not one single thing. If you have thyroid problems your hormones may be off, but that's a medical problem that will be managed. It's not gender related. If you go for a run and burn calories you can eat more, the balance between energy in and energy out. 

The body fat percentages have nothing to do with it either. We're talking about people with percentages of at least 30% here. The average person will not go below 15% unless they are severely underweight or training and really trying to get to 10% (which would be what men trying to maintain a six pack would aim for) Once again, this is not related to calories, this is something different entirely. Someone with low body fat percentages and a lot of muscle will eat the same amount of calories as someone with a high body fat percentage and no muscle of the same weight. (Unless the athletic person/sporter is cutting or bulking at that time of course)

Figure out how many calories someone is allowed to eat. This is individual and not gender related. What matters is how much they burn and how much they currently weigh.

&gt; It's a British Tradition

Lot's of things are 'traditions'. Just because something has been going on for a long time doesn't mean it's justifiable to continue. 

&gt; People enjoy it

Same as above. People enjoy a lot of things. Just because somebody enjoys something doesn't justify it continuing.

&gt; Foxes are pests

Sure, but there must be more humane ways to deal with them.

&gt; Have you seen how ""humane"" foxes are to their pray? Foxes actually kill for fun. If a fox comes across a bunch of chickens it'll kill every one despite only eating one or two.

I'd like to think, as human beings, we hold ourselves to higher moral standards than small mammals. Just because animals are cruel doesn't justify humans being so.

&gt; Anti-Fox hunting campaigners are often urban folk who really have no insight into rural perspectives or affairs. Is this not pretty damn elitist?

And I'm sure there's plenty of rural folk who oppose hunting as well. Just because somebody isn't directly involved in an activity doesn't mean they aren't allowed to have an opinion on it. If anything, being outside that activity might result in you having a more unbiased view on it.

People don't know that one portion of nuts is 13 nuts and not two hands full for example. Bread is great as it's fortified with vitamins, but eat 8 slices of bread and you'll get fat. I agree that the products you named are unhealthy, but rather than banning them, I think we need education. People are not educated on food, yet they make food choices every day. How is it that we teach the children how to solve useless maths problems they'll never see or need again, yet something they need daily isn't being taught?

Crisps can have their place in the world. Kelloggs can be fine from time to time as long as the diet is managed and the vitamin- and mineral needs are met. Banning things won't stop overeating, they can overeat just as easily on something like nuts. It's education and portion control we need. People need to learn to read the packaging and figure out whether something is appropriate to eat. Everything in moderation works, but people have forgotten what that looks like.

That being said, I would welcome an update in the advice being given out. (Stay away from processed foods would be a great start) If the government were to ban foods and drinks with high sugar content however, they would come up with artificial sweetened products.
