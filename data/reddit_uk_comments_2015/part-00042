Book the boat now (gets busy)

Accommodation would be either camping, house stay or hotel. Again book in advance. I rent my house out over tt as do a lot of locals. Expect to pay ~£25 per person per night for a basic roof over your head. Camping less probably. 

Fyi, not all the locals like the bikers so don't expect to be loved and invited in for free places everywhere you go. You will be one of tens of thousands of other people coming. Bear in mind you are a guest and you will be fine.

You can rent bikes while here if you aren't bringing yours. 

To get to the best places you really need your own transport or someone to drive you. You are locked in all day so choose wisely and be aware of whether you are inside or outside the course. 

Definitely check out Bushy's beer tent on the prom in Douglas (all the locals go here), Okells at the grandstand (the racers go there too), the casino and legendary piano bar.

Food: Tandoor, On the Rocks, Railway, British, Broadway Masala, L'experience, Paparazzi.

As for the GMOs. Her main concerns there seemed to be related to the corporate side of GMOs, and the political element. She said make sure they're safe, but safe is a very big term - and she raised monocultures in particular.

null,false,Trollatopoulous,null,null,null,"&gt; she said that nuclear was slow

Everything is slow, but without exact figures it's a meaningless statement.

&gt; the rapidly decreasing cost of solar

But compared to nuclear? Still sky-high. Besides the more downsides that solar has (most of all in Britain) compared to nuclear.

&gt; So instead of using nuclear as a stop gap

This is the problem with people without a clue talking about it. Nuclear isn't a stop gap, because

&gt; we just jump to renewables

Is not possible. There are logistical problems associated with both wind and solar which make them unfeasible as primary energy sources.

&gt; Her main concerns

Are irrelevant, because she quickly says we have to wait until they're safe even though the scientific community has long since deemed them to be so; as for the talk about corporations, that's just prattle for the rabble and has no bearing on banning GMOs themselves rather than regulating the market (if that should even happen in the way they hint at).

&gt; As for the UBI, she linked

Yes, she linked to someone else's work that doesn't specifically address what *her party* would do to achieve UBI. It's clear that a UBI is possible, but that's not what people are interested in hearing, they're interested in hearing what the GP's plan is.

No, it is not.

It's ostensibly included within National Insurance, which is a different levy and is separate from and additional to Income Tax.

I believe National Insurance is an additional 12% once your earnings are above the Primary Threshold, with an additional 2% payable once you are a Higher Rate taxpayer.

You should note that the true figure is significantly higher as National Insurance also has an *employer* contribution, which usually isn't included on a payslip as the employee doesn't personally pay it.

I say that National Insurance ostensibly pays for the NHS as it's not actually hypothecated for it - the money is not reserved unfortunately.

We worked hard defensively, and when we could, admittedly not much in the first half, we broke forward and tried to carve an opening. I know Gomis has got stick, but he looked like today he was trying for us, his aerial ability on Southampton corners was useful, in which, may I add, we defended all crosses and corners fantastically. Ashley Williams was fantastic. He is a great leader and a fantastic man, who has seemingly developed a strong relationship at CB with Fede Fernandez. 9 clean sheets I think that is for us now, and that's quite an achievement given the recent drubbings. Naughton had a rather brilliant debut, his passing was on point and worked hard defensively. I have no doubts we'll see more of him in our upcoming games against less offensive opponents. 

With our key players missing this was an important win for us given our results in recent weeks, and what a way to show the doubters we cannot cope without Bony, admittedly we could do with a new striker in the summer. I look forward to transfer deadline day with the recent injuries on our wingers and dips in form (dyer) I could imagine we'll be dipping into our bony money looking  for a winger with so many out.

The second concern I think is basically the same, just condensed - it's seen as an unknown, and that we should tread carefully as we walk into it.

Their stance on GMOs is one I disagree with. But their overall policy of placing science spending at 1% of GDP - double the projection of other parties, is a good one.

Clear any clutter at all that you possibly can - if you were 'going to use/read/watch/eat it some day', clear it out now. Gut rooms or cupboards you don't use much, have a good look for mouse nests, put stuff back. Wash your hands.

Any holes in walls, floors or skirting you can poke a biro fully into need to be stuffed up with steel wool. Mice can't bite into steel wool and it cuts their entry routes down. Use UV light to follow the trails of piss around to see where they're going. They will tend to stick to the edges of rooms, or go under furniture that is close to walls.

Get very, very, very serious about putting anything edible inside either metal or tupperware. Mice need to eat, and whatever they eat becomes dangerous to people.

I'm really glad you're getting pest control in and not faffing about with humane traps. Cute as they are, house mice need to be dead. They carry diseases, really not nice ones, like salmonella and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. 'Humane' traps move the mouse into unfamiliar territory and either an unpleasant death from predation or starvation, or they become someone else's problem. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus isn't a nice present to give to other people because you're 'being nice'. If anyone gives you a hard time about killing the poor mice, remind them of the above.

You just have to hope that the idiots in power at one point in time don't fuck things over so badly that the slow progress we do have from change evening out across successive governments, doesn't grind to a halt or reverse. If you look back at history things -are- generally getting better... though not as fast as they could be.

That's probably the fault of older generations not wanting change, which is understandable, and I suspect most liberals of today will end up as conservative in their old age, not because their views change, but because things move on and their views don't change. And then those views are imposed on the youth to some extent, and decried by those who don't agree as ""indoctrination"".

Then again, you don't want things to move too fast, as while sections of society who have ideas for sweeping change which will make ""everything better"" may well prove to be on the whole, -right-, that doesn't mean that their plan of how to implement it is workable. You need to give people time to adjust too, there's a lot to be said for moderation, which neither UKIP nor the Greens seem to understand, or Lab/Con for that matter quite often...

I don't know what you'd call it, but I hope that the next ""big"" change we see isn't to some kind of utopian society like Ian M. Banks' ""Culture"" as it's simply not workable yet, but rather to something where corporations are forced into looking after people and the hoarding of wealth is extremely difficult. Individuals need profit, of a reasonable level, not hilarious levels for corporations... and that doesn't disincentivize anyone to do anything either, as profit is all relative to someone elses profit anyway. Oh and sorting out the fucking housing issue as well. Just instigate some kind of ""buy to live in or rent at a reasonable price"" law on any new-builds, I don't know...

Neo capitalism, but with less capitalism, maybe? More philanthropy basically and less greed... by law if it's the way we have to do it :P

Its certainly possible to get a copy of the firmware &amp; whilst a JTAG interface isn't fitted I know people have managed to fit them. So it would certainly be possible to reverse engineer &amp; modify the proprietary code.

Beyond my capabilities though. :( Even if I could solder a JTAG onto the board (or fit a push-pin adapter or whatever) I don't have the necessary skills to RE the firmware or compile and load new.

&gt;Exactly. All that has happened is the reasons to use Sky have decreased. People are getting more content in more ways. Free television has also hugely expanded.

As has card-sharing. It's trivial to buy a box and 12 month C-line from eBay that's just plug and play for less than a ton. No HD though. Not that I'd recommend it, obviously. Ahem.

As you said, Sky changed something about the encryption so afaik there's no card sharing for HD channels at the moment. But they can't kill it for SD without killing the old SD boxes which would hurt them more than help right now. 

With the HD boxes at least, you need to call up Sky to let them know you've changed boxes (even if those boxes aren't connected to a phone or net connection). Otherwise at the very least the HD channels stop working after some length of time.

&gt;Sky ""freesat"" list the channels they offer. Freesat do the same. I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to parse the two into lists and run a diff on them. Would offer, but i'm tired and lazy!

I figured someone else would have already done it. I am lazy too, and I generally go by ""there are no new problems"".

For so many years I've waited for the next big thing to emerge from our youth ranks, gotten my hopes up time and again, to varying degrees of failure, all the while proper little footballers sprouting out fully formed all around us. I remember Dean Marney's brace against Everton. I remember Lee Barnard netting a goal a game for the reserves. I remember Taraabt coming on against West Ham. I remember watching highlights of Coulibaly in the U-17 World Cup. I really thought Caulker was going to be our reincarnated number 26. I remember the gradual disappointment, the denial followed by reluctant acceptance that inevitably followed each and every one.

I've known about Kane for a few years now. Saw him come on a few times in the Europa and not do very much, followed (in vain) for any progress at Norwich. As much as I hate to say it, I had my doubts. I am so so happy that I've been proven wrong.

To answer your question though, the two you've mentioned are the most likely IMO. Carroll's next move after a prem loan has to be play or be sold - will he be a Walker or a Caulker? Haven't watched him much but apparently Pritchard is tearing up the championship so I could see him being fast-tracked, especially with Pochettino in charge.

I have masters degrees in both computational neuroscience and physics and thus am well aware that their anti-animal testing and anti-nuclear power policies are absurd. They appear to be vestiges of the 'Atomkraft, nein danke!' and ALF types.

They seem willing to compromise on GM crops - but on GM animals such as the vital 'knockout mice' they appear utterly dogmatic. I worry they will be similarly stubborn on nuclear power - although it is worth mentioning that there is a sizeable 'Bright Green' faction that supports it.

Basic Income wouldn't necessarily leave the poorer worse off - I am an emphatic supporter of the policy as it gets rid of welfare bureaucracy. Ultimately we have to pay people to stop them from starving - it is far more efficient to do so unconditionally (thus removing much bureaucracy and the possibility that those in need may not get the money) and then recoup the extra cost through the existing tax system (which is already in place anyway so we are already paying the overhead) rather than having a confusing and byzantine welfare system of tax credits, housing benefit and numerous other things. /r/basicincome does a very good job of explaining it - far better than the Green Party to be entirely honest. I could spend ages discussing this policy but I am convinced that it would be an improvement on the current system.

I haven't seen the policy on female prisoners although I believe that it mainly related to the greater effect it had on the family. To be honest I support a vast reduction in custodial sentences in any case with the exception of repeat violent offenders where I support the death penalty - a highly controversial position I am aware - but I believe that protecting the innocent majority is the priority and I see little reason to pay the high cost of incarcerating violent criminals for life when with repeat offenders it is clear that they still present a danger and that there is a negligible chance of innocence.

I mentioned their policies that I strongly agree with in a previous post - and I hope that by voting for them it will encourage the Liberal Democrats to actually return to their Liberal policies rather than just being Tory Lite.

null,false,Antagony,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire Pudding,null,"&gt; Again, Sky managed 10-15 years without the BBC or any terrestrial channels. Quite successfully.

Oh you mean when it had hardly only a tiny fraction of the subscribers it has now? That isn't going to wash because the big growth of subscription uptake came *after* they started broadcasting the terrestrial channels.

&gt;I'd also have wondered why the BBC cannot pay a trivial fee (£4+ billion budget) to make itself available to the largest single group of viewers.

It's not a trivial amount when you consider the Beeb are continuously having to slash their budgets across the board and at the same time they're consistently losing out to Sky on the rights to sports coverage. 

And the platform doesn't comprise the largest single group of viewers. Their share is 37.1% as opposed to terrestrial's 47.6%. Even if you include all the other pay services – cable, streamed TV, etc. – it's still less than half of the total [[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_the_United_Kingdom#Revenue_sources)]. But even if you were right, the fact is those numbers wouldn't be so high but for the availability of the terrestrial channels. 

&gt;Sky does not make money from the BBC's availability.

No, it makes money from two primary sources: subscriptions, which would be fewer without the terrestrial channels, and advertising, which would not be as valuable with fewer subscribers. 

&gt;Personally I think the BBC should at least pay whatever Sky's actual costs are in making the BBC available… 

That would only be reasonable if the BBC content was of no value to their subscription sales. My personal view is £0 charges each way is perfectly fair and they ought to have reached this point of equilibrium years ago.

I don't have figures and I doubt anyone except govt. holds that kind of thing, but taxing drugs will require us to treat their inevitable effects. Alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking already sucks up a tonne of the NHS budget annually and it's probably debatable as to how much of a percentage of tax income (on those products) that is. **edit:** and I'm not necessarily talking just direct treatment either, be it cancer, transplant or whatever. I'm talking man hours in terms of A&amp;E visits, medicinal prescriptions for induced diseases (kidney failure, liver failure, infection) not to mention the amount of plumbs that wander into A&amp;E on a friday night/Saturday morning with severe body injuries after a night out on the lash. There are illegal drugs which are not overtly ""harmful"" which produce similar effects to alcohol in the short term. It's not unreasonable to suspect a similar trend will occur. Ask a triage nurse if they want their workload doubling and they will clonk you in the face. I'm talking about keeping an already fragile society safe for the future, not opening it up to profiting from individuals who either can't escape or don't know any better.

Assuming though that tax was either in the black or at least balanced, it's still encouraging people to screw themselves up. And all in the name of profits too. I just don't think anyone, least of all the government should be exploiting people like that (profiting from their addictions).

If we legalised use of drugs, all it's going to do is increase burden on an already strained health system, irrespective of ""profits"" to be made from taxing those poor bastards that can't help what they're doing. Giving up fast food to save your heart is one thing but giving up addictive drugs is another. All we'd be doing is preying on the poor sods and siphoning money off them. It's no better than what's happening to them now except criminals benefit instead.

It's being looked at the wrong way. We shouldn't legalise them and prey on the vulnerable. Educate them instead, get them away from the stuff in the first place. Then there's no need to tax them and no need to waste money treating them.

null,false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"&gt; Oh you mean when it had hardly only a tiny fraction of the subscribers it has now? That isn't going to wash because the big growth of subscription uptake came after they started broadcasting the terrestrial channels.

Wikipedia claims that they had 6 million customers in 1996, two years before they launched a digital service and two before the BBC ever appeared on the platform. 6 million to 10 million in close to 20 years doesn't seem as significant growth as 6 million in about 6 years.

It simply is not true that people subscribe to Sky to watch the BBC. They subscribe to get Sky channels, and expect the BBC to be there too - since they pay a licence fee for those channels and should be able to watch them in the way they deem necessary. If that means the BBC having to pay fees to make it so, then so be it.

&gt; It's not a trivial amount when you consider the Beeb are continuously having to slash their budgets across the board and at the same time they're consistently losing out to Sky on the rights to sports coverage. 

The BBC have to cut budges because of a licence fee freeze, and probably because they've realised that trying to chase Sky and BT for sports rights that only a minority of viewers care about, is not a good use of their money. They're a public service broadcaster, not a ""let's do everything"" broadcaster. Sky and BT have money to burn, the BBC does not. Neither does ITV, for that matter. Sky and BT make these investments knowing that they can make a profit by selling the channels to subscribers.

&gt; And the platform doesn't comprise the largest single group of viewers. Their share is 37.1% as opposed to terrestrial's 47.6%. Even if you include all the other pay services – cable, streamed TV, etc. – it's still less than half of the total [source]. But even if you were right, the fact is those numbers wouldn't be so high but for the availability of the terrestrial channels. 

I'm not convinced about those numbers. They include analogue TV, which has been dead for at least 3 years and almost dead for about the last 5 and therefore are ancient and outdated, and in a different table they are talking about reach for some providers and the actual customer base of others, and basically assuming every house has and uses Freeview, which is not necessarily accurate or true.

&gt; But even if you were right, the fact is those numbers wouldn't be so high but for the availability of the terrestrial channels. 

You can keep labouring this point but it's not true.

&gt; No, it makes money from two primary sources: subscriptions, which would be fewer without the terrestrial channels, and advertising, which would not be as valuable with fewer subscribers. 

Once again you make the point and once again you have nothing to prove it, but there is overwhelming proof that Sky was popular before the BBC and is popular despite it. It's about as relevant as saying the BBC is the most important site on the internet, when it is simply one of many, and not responsible for the internet's success.

&gt; That would only be reasonable if the BBC content was of no value to their subscription sales. My personal view is £0 charges each way is perfectly fair and they ought to have reached this point of equilibrium years ago. 

The BBC is available to any Sky box user, regardless of whether they subscribe or not. It is no different to the other hundreds of free channels that don't get paid by Sky to be there and don't need a subscription to be viewed. They also pay Sky.

The fee I suggested is reasonable because Sky's cost of putting the BBC on the guide is non-zero, and it's largely baseless that they hugely benefit from their presence.

It's also worth noting that Sky pays Freesat for a few of their channels to appear in Freesat's guide. Freesat is jointly owned by the BBC and ITV. Do you think Sky's channels should get to be on Freesat for free?",null,0,null,1422829646,null,0,1422829963,0,co83tr9,null,t3_2ub1nd,null,t1_co83tr9,null,t1_co83ljw,null,null,null,1424266434,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

If men were 80000 times more likely to be raped that would be approximately 27 million men raped every year. Somewhat unlikely given that there are only 26 million males aged 15+ in the UK.",null,0,null,1422830320,null,0,false,0,co846j6,null,t3_2uewyw,null,t1_co846j6,null,t1_co833xv,null,null,null,1424266268,null,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

That's tight, but without knowing the details I'm going to assume that you're shopping efficiently and taking the cheapest transport option available.

£150 a month gives you £1800 a year, which would take you less than two years to save up a 5% deposit for this place in Luton:

Harry Kane’s a footballer. An English footballer who plays for Tottenham. Who is from Chingford, and came through the Academy. He’s also scoring goals. Due to his success and endearing, relentless style of play he already has his own chant:

‘Harry Kane, He’s One of Our Own’.

Something about that chant just doesn’t sit right with me. True, he is a local lad. But Spurs have had their fair share of ‘local lads’ over the years. Most notably Ledley King, who played his whole career at Tottenham, was born in Bow, and captained the side. But Ledley King also happened to be black.

Some may say it’s only natural Harry Kane is ‘one of their own’ due to his looks mirroring those of the White Hart Lane faithful. However Tottenham is vastly multicultural. In fact South Tottenham has been reported as the most ethnically-diverse areas in Europe, with 300 languages spoken. Obviously not everyone residing in Tottenham follows the team, and the majority of Spurs fans may be white, but the decision to adopt Harry Kane as their poster child is curious if not worrying. Especially because just last season the fans had their successful home-grown kid: Andros Townsend, again from the Academy, this time born in Leytonstone (still Tottenham territory) who also grew up in Chingford and even became a pivotal player for England in World Cup Qualifying. But Andros happened to have a Jamaican father and a Greek Cypriot mother- evidently not ‘One of their Own’.

An issue with fans chants is they aren’t vetted. They are not agreed upon by the Club’s PR team and do not have to be politically correct. That is also the beauty of them. Otherwise we would never have had the joy of ‘Chelsea, wherever you may be, keep your wife from John Terry’ an ode concocted by Chelsea fans to celebrate the escapades of their captain with a former team-mate’s girlfriend (to the tune of Lord of the Dance). But see, that’s funny, and also utilises the tune of a favoured sing along. ‘Harry Kane, He’s One of Our Own’ does no such thing.

What should also be noted about chants is their random nature. His chant could just as easily been borne out of his goofy looks or slicked back hair. It just so happened his chant was borne out of his race. Perhaps something about him exudes an every-man nature, that goofy look maybe- he doesn’t look like the archetypal young star. So maybe it’s not just his race which resulted in the chant, but his exact look.

However the point still stands, if he wasn’t white the chant would not exist.  

The final point which must be addressed is whether this even matters. From the players perspective for Andros Townsend it obviously doesn’t, he tweeted ‘He’s one of own, he’s one of our oooown @hkane28 he’s one of our own!!’ following Spurs 5-3 defeat of Chelsea (Harry Kane scored two goals). Perhaps I am overreacting, but I think at times we can focus solely on the praise of an individual and become oblivious to those a statement may (unwittingly?) exclude. For me I can understand but not particularly like if he is being celebrated for what he is, I just hope he isn’t being celebrated for what he isn’t.",null,0,null,1422830535,null,0,false,0,co84akm,null,t3_2ugbui,null,t1_co84akm,null,t3_2ugbui,null,null,null,1424266216,null,-2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-2,null

Harry Kane isn't one of our own because the fan base is predominately white. He is one of our own because he is a local lad we nurtured and grew ourselves through the academy, who has worked his socks off and rightly earned his spot. A spot that was occupied by players earning 10x the money he was. He is one of our own because he shows and ignites a passion for the badge that had gone missing for some time now. 

The Townsend point holds no ground, yes Townsend may technically be another ""one of our own"" but his performances rarely spark such enthusiasm to birth that chant. He has improved recently but are you seriously expecting us to belt out ""Andros Townsend is one of our own"" after the 6th, 7th, 8th shot into row Z? Has Townsend single handedly revived the fight in the team I mentioned above? Has Townsend scored 20 goals for the club already?The team feeds off of Kane and the fans feed off the team. 

I'm not saying Townsend doesn't deserve the chant, I'm saying that's just not how football or fans work. Kane is the focal point of the team just as **any** striker is, was King making childs play of one of the leagues best defences and banging goals in for fun? No but he still earned his own glory and had his own chants. Have you forgotten that a black player has his own area of the stadium dedicated to a quote of his? Or that our entire stadium predominantly filled with white supporters sold out its testimonial game for said player? 

This article actually offended me, to think race is at play here and that it's *""worrying""* is almost laughable. Please stop writing about Spurs, or better yet full stop. With bollocks like this you're only in for humiliation/backlash.

null,false,miomike,null,null,null,"How the fuck did we not win? Seriously? I mentioned it somewhere in the match thread, but Saints lack a match winner too often. We are amazing, stupendous, brilliant as a team unit. Individual errors sometimes cost us a goal, or fail to take advantage of a good chance, but we've got where we are through good team play, then someone will eventually cap off a nice move or something. Not today though.   

Today we were just inept at everything involving getting that fucking ball into the sodding net. Someone needed to just take charge and pull the trigger - like Shelvey. Do our players not have the confidence to try to shoot from outside the area anymore? Are they just not capable? We've had very few shots like that for a long time, we're always playing it in Arsenal style. It was worse last season by a long shot, but it has happened a few times where our build up play has just been put over actually getting the ball in the net. Doesn't help that when we did work a chance it was squandered, Ward-Prowse, love him though I do, has had at least 4 decent chance to score in the last few games, he really needs to just get one in to make us all happier.  

Tadic just isn't suited to the right, he can occasionally whip a nice looking ball in but too often he just doesn't deliver the goods. He's not got the explosive pace to cut inside and shoot, and is unwilling to shoot anyway, as he himself has admitted. We want Tadic to do what Shelvey did, we all think he's capable of it, but he never does and never pulls it off. I'm in no way saying he's a bad player, and I'm still happy we've got him, but on the right he is too often lacking, and it's frustrating after seeing him do something like orchestrate the downfall of Sunderland.  

I still think we need a different striker, a line-leading striker. Long isn't one, I like him, he was the type of player we were missing today (though Mane did well, glad to see he's back). Elia looks like a good loan, he's trying his hardest, and he seems to have the flair that makes a good winger - and I can see him scoring a stunner like we need at some point. Rodriguez might come back and lead the line, but he's basically a mystery these at present, like a knew signing for us knowing how he'll come back or play in our system - but if he pulled through he could be exactly what we need. We've seen his runs, his hold up play, his build up play, his finishing (though originally lacking was obviously great last season when in form). I honestly hope he'll be back this season and just magically be what we need.  

All in all, just frustrating, enough so that I wanted to write a wall of text as I so often do.

Playing LB still allows him the option to attack but means defenders won't be ready for him or concentrating their defence his way. He's got the fitness to run up and down all day so he's not going to tire out. Plus 'Arry reckons he's a left back and he knows what he's doing.""

That's also called the Angel in Braintree and built in the 1500's. The one on Notley road is the other side of the town has the same name. You might want to check which it was that her ancestor owned as both could be possible options.


As to getting to Braintree, by train it's about 45minutes from central London ~£40 for a one way ticket. 


* Taxi is not worth talking about as you will be talking insane money.


* Driving unless they plan to spend a lot of time in Braintree (It's pretty dull) will take anything from 1hour to 90minutes (traffic dependant and also providing there's not road problems with a crash on one of the main roads that tends to grind most of the county to a standstill. 


* Remember the time difference when you call as it's 23:30 (11:30pm here now). This may also explain why you didn't get an answer as they may have been closing at the time or nearing that point and not answering any further.


* To Dial use the following numbers (I've seen so many people who don't realise that they need to use a dialing code)
0044 1376 326220 To call the one on Notley Road
0044 1376 343839 to call the one at Bradford Street


* Also don't use a witheld number as a lot of people in the UK as a whole wont answer them. Conversely if you are not and getting no answer try withholding and you might get lucky as could be a case of it's unusual for a business like a pub to get a call from an international number and concerns it may be a phone scam.",null,0,null,1422833767,null,0,1422833954,0,co85ymx,null,t3_2ufiu1,null,t1_co85ymx,null,t3_2ufiu1,null,null,null,1424265416,null,5,false,Essex,t5_2ship,5,null

Anyway, we're beginning to argue in circles now and neither of us are likely to change our opinions so I don't see much point in continuing this discussion. Suffice it to say I believe Sky ***must*** value having the BBC channels on their platform, or they wouldn't have agreed to drop the retransmission fee.

Because society as a whole is not all that violent it is not really justifiable for anyone to arm themselves for self defence, if someone is expecting to be attacked then they can report it and there are measures that can be out in place ranging from simple words of advice, home office alarms right to protective custody. If someone is threatened with violence then again common law allows them to defend themselves, but when threatened with a weapon? It's so rare but when it happens then the best bet is to flee not fight. Although unprovoked attacks are very very rare.

There is no reasonable grounds for the general public to carry weapons for defence as the threat to them is not great at all.

null,false,MatthewWilkes,null,null,null,"The simple answer: **listentotaxman.com is right, but there's another 1000-3000 GBP per year that it doesn't account for as it's not income dependent.**

Longer answer: listentotaxman.com and similar sites will be correct, they'll tell you the money you can expect to get in your pay cheque for a given salary. That is all of your job-related taxation. The NHS is funded from this general taxation, there's no equivalent of a Krankenkasse. Pensions are funded from National Insurance, you will need to pay a certain minimum amount of NI for 10 years before you become eligible for state pension, but that's not all it does, it is also used for things like unemployment benefit, etc. You can pretty much ignore what it's going towards and just accept that there are two categories of tax with different rates and thresholds. **National Insurance is not optional**. You may want to look in to how you continue RV contributions in Germany, I do not believe it's possible to transfer the money paid in in the UK. Again, this is because NI covers more than just pensions, you're not paying into a personal fund, you're paying a mandatory tax and you qualify for pensions after a certain time working in the UK.

That said, what nobody's mentioned is Council Tax. This is a tax based on the value of the home you're living in. This is generally between £1000 and £3000 a year, but it varies depending on where in the country you are (it's set by local authorities), the value of your home, if you're the only resident, if you're a full time student, etc. It is for the entire household, so if your home attracts a £2000/year council tax bill and there are four people living there, you pay £41/month each (although you'll likely find it easier to have it automatically deducted from one bank account hand handle the splitting between the residents). If you're the only resident there is a 25% discount. It is billed monthly and there's a (deserved) reputation for the local authorities to be bad at administering it, so if you aren't proactive the first you hear about it might be a court summons. Not that they'll actually take you to court unless you really do intend to not pay, but they have a habit of losing paperwork, etc. It's frustrating. You can expect to pay about £120/month on council tax for a nice one-bed city centre flat.

No amount of education is going to discourage people from taking drugs, not if there illegal. People already take a ton of drugs. Have you ever tried MDMA? There is no way you wouldn't talk an open-minded close friend into trying it. That stuff will blow your mind. Your way of thinking has been tried and tested and it just made things worse.


You should do some research on when they made heroin illegal in this country. We had less than 1000 addicts (veterans who got hooked on morphine, chinese opium addicts, they got it off their doctor and didn't hurt anyone). Then they made it illegal. A few years later and we had tens of thousands of addicts. 


Medical grade heroin is relatively harmless when injected correctly. Other than constipation and withdrawal you can take heroin 10 times a day and live to be 100, no problem. Overdoses typically stem from street heroin being an inconsistent quality. What they think of as an average dose can end up far more potent. I'm not saying you should be able to get it from a corner shop. But why not from a doctor?


I think you and I have very different definitions of what counts as preying on poor sods.


To be honest I couldn't care less about the profits. But when you don't talk about money that's all right-wingers care about. Imagine how much treatment and preventive education could be provided with a couple extra billion in the budget?

Especially interesting is what you're saying about how the law would simply enforce what the contract currently states anyway, even if the contract hadn't stated it. In effect, all the contract is doing in this specific clause is giving me a heads up, if I've understood that correctly. What you suggested about getting confirmation seems possible - it's a small company with direct leadership, and the manager seemed very reasonable when I had the interview. I imagine I should have no problems getting written clarification from him for each piece of software I make - it's not as if I intend to pump out hundreds of different bits of software.

I can see what you mean about getting some proper advice. My employment doesn't start with this company until July, so what I will do is send back my signed contract and seek advice in the interim. Is this an advisable sequence of actions, given that I am not contracted to start until July? It's just that I want to get this contract back to them, since it's already been a week since I received it. And if so, are there any specific firms you suggest I contact for advice?

However, don't think we should change the system while it's working so well, so Kolo should take a place on the bench.

So I think that our best back 3 would be Sakho Kolo Skrtel, however I think we should stick with Sakho Skrtel Can for now, because we've been doing fairly well with those 3.

&gt;__San Pellegrino__ (also __S. Pellegrino__) is an [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) [brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand) of [mineral water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_water), and assorted real-fruit beverages made from it, with naturally occurring [carbonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonation) and additional carbonation added by the bottler, produced and [bottled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottling) by [Nestlé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9) at [San Pellegrino Terme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pellegrino_Terme), in the [Province of Bergamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Bergamo), [Lombardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). The water naturally contains [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) and at least the following [chemical elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_elements) in amounts of 100 or more [micrograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgram) per liter: [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium), [chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloride), [fluorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine), [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium), [magnesium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium), [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen), [potassium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium), [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon), [sodium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium), and the non-radioactive form of [strontium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium). Outside of Italy, San Pellegrino is portrayed as a luxury and expensive bottled water, despite the fact that it can be bought for approximately US $2 in many convenience and grocery stores. Owned by [Nestlé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9) since 1997, San Pellegrino is exported to most countries in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas), [Australasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia) and the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East), as well as to [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan), and [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong).

To state a truism, racism is complex, usually unintentional, and frequently unnoticed by those purveying it.  Good people can be racist, and often are, in some fashion or another.  And people who are racist in one way also frequently fight against racism in other ways.  

The kind of racism the author is suggesting here happens all the time, even in societies that pride themselves on their egalitarianism.

Just because the analysis is off, it doesn't mean that the idea is that far-fetched.  It's worth at least a moment's thought, even if, after such thought, the conclusion is ""no.""  The author even acknowledges that he/she may be overreacting.

I'd be angry if this were published in a reputable media outlet, but it wasn't.  He/she put it here on a community forum, where troubling ideas should be welcome even if they are ultimately shot down in discussion.

Harry is not ""one of our own"" because he's a tall, white goof. It's because he's our very own top class striker who is giving us the goals we need when our £26m Spanish import cannot.

null,false,EireOfTheNorth,null,null,null,"Someone attacked my mothers boyfriends apartment (because he asked them to keep the noise of their party down, at 4am) with knives, screwdrivers, broken bottles etc. A year or two ago in Lurgan.

News hit the local paper, and about 5-6 days later we heard reports of a shotgun being shot through the windows of the scumbags that attacked the house. Can't say I feel sympathetic whatsoever for them, they attacked a house with a 5-6 year old girl, and a 12 year old boy in it. Think they fled/moved to somewhere else

Cops said they knew who they were (they were still hanging about when the cops showed up 2hrs after the attack started), shouting abuse and death threats at my mothers bf/my mother/my little brother. Cops ***didn't*** prosecute or even *arrest* anyone at the scene. Cops came back the next day and suggested my mothers boyfriend **moved out**. Where the fuck is the justice in that?

Vigilante justice *is* indeed an archaic and outdated form of justice, but when you have peelers that straight up *do not* police the streets, what else can you depend on?


Edit: I've told this story before here. Mothers bf ended up moving out, nobody was ever arrested for it - police actively refused despite DNA evidence (think one of them was a tout or something). There was knives, screwdrivers, broken bottles left at the scene (inside the house). They broke through the front door, and only the bedroom door separated them from maybe even killing my only surviving parent, and my little brother.",null,0,null,1422842592,null,0,1422842911,0,co8amts,null,t3_2ufhic,null,t1_co8amts,null,t3_2ufhic,null,null,null,1424263175,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

Doesn't change the fact that it is plausible and worth thinking and possibly talking about.  And thus doesn't deserve downvotes, in my opinion.

I'm not entirely sure Townsend would get quite the same treatment if he started performing like an elite winger.  Not because of any racial issue, but because he's not a mouth-breathing goofy-looking lad from Chingford (he's a good-looking lad from Leytonstone), he has a reputation in some quarters (probably *not* deservedly) of being a bit self-centered, he doesn't communicate with the humility that Kane does, he's older than Kane, and he did spend a lot more time away from the club on loan than Kane did (again, not Andros' fault, but it's there).  For these and other reasons, people do embrace Kane in ways they don't (and maybe wouldn't) embrace Townsend.  Even before Kane blossomed, I think he got more love than Townsend.

Then again, maybe you are correct, maybe we would sing ""he's one of our own"" for Andros every match if he blossomed from ""frustrating"" Andros to ""Willian who?"" Andros.  Maybe people would start making a big deal about his prankster nature, his handsomeness, and the fact that we went out on *so many* loans and yet still came home and made good.  Success has a way of changing the way people interpret a player's qualities.

Or maybe he'd get a different but no less adoring song.  We won't know until he fulfills his potential.

p.s. Of course ""they"" is widely accepted in common communication.  I just don't like its grammatical inconsistency.  And it's not accepted in formal and academic writing (which is not an issue on reddit, but still causes me to rue the absence of a singular third person gender-neutral pronoun).  Then again, I also get annoyed that number and case distinctions have disappeared in our second person pronouns.  Thankfully, a distinct second person plural is re-emerging in some places, but I confess to not really liking how any of them sound. /endgrammarwhining

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"Ironically this hurts doctors the most.We don't make enough money to match the work we do. Like teachers, we take our work home. The main problem is we have increased debts and in the old days new doctors used to get subsidised accommodation and food and a lower salary. Think 8000 quid lower and that was fine. A basic one bedroom flat (doctors share poorly since we like our sleep and have odd hours) is around 6000 quid a year in this day and age.  If you calculate food and utilities then you actually used to get more money particularly since you used to party very little tax. Now the problem is we aren't paid as much as we used to. We also have massive debts compared to other professionals. Close to 70,000 quid. It takes a long time to write that off and do all the things we need to do like but a car.In effect, for the work load we are the lowest paid. Sure we can earn more than the prime minister but most doctors don't earn that. That's the final salary. A product of 15 to 20 years of training and work and meeting excellence standards. This is without all the unpaid work you do.A solution would be to give new doctors an easier ride. Write off the cost of medical education if a doctor joins a speciality or general practice. Then we can talk about taxes.Think of it this way.

• a long term replacement for Lucas. Lucas has been great but who knows whether he'll stay here in the future or not. Bender is only 25, close to reaching his peak, and has been an excellent DM for a good time. 

• and a leader CB to strengthen our defense (dream partnership with Sakho).

They'd each go for £20-30m I think, if Dortmund was to be relegated, depending on how willing they would be to leave and how willing Dortmund would be to sell so they don't get fucked over financially. Then we could have lineups like these:

• sell two of Balotelli/Lambert/Borini... we'd probably get £10-15m for each. 

• get a better backup/competition for Mignolet 

• perhaps sell Enrique and get a better back up left back/competition for Moreno.

null,false,mmlnhe,null,null,null,"&gt; The procedure, which was developed by British scientists, allows IVF clinics to replace an egg's defective mitochondrial DNA with healthy DNA from a female donor, to prevent children suffering debilitating conditions like muscular dystrophy.

It's actually the other way around. The nuclear DNA is taken out of the original cell with the genomically undesirable mitochondria, and put it in the donor cell which has been screened for having healthy mitochondrial DNA.

There's a nice diagram of the techniques in this report: http://www.hfea.gov.uk/docs/Third_Mitochondrial_replacement_scientific_review.pdf

&gt; [Bishop John Sherrington said:] “There are also serious ethical objections to this procedure which involves the destruction of human embryos as part of the process. The human embryo is a new human life, and it should be respected and protected from the moment of conception.”

In theory, the extent of this ethical objection depends on the technique - always true for pronuclear transfer (PNT) but not as much for maternal spindle transfer (MST).

For PNT, the eggs are fertilized before transfer, so the discarded parts include the pronuclei (combination of paternal and maternal genetic material) from the donor zygote, and the empty maternal zygote. So this amounts to the destruction of one zygote for every surviving zygote.

This technically isn't an embryo as that only applies from the first cell division, but assuming that the bishop was speaking more loosely and considers fertilization to be the genesis of life, then this could be considered an ethical concern.

The MST technique only deals with eggs: the maternal genetic material is transferred over to an empty donor egg. Then you proceed with IVF as usual - fertilising it with the father's sperm, leaving it grow for a few days, and implanting the embryo into the mother's uterus. So in theory this doesn't result in any destroyed embryos at all.

However - in practice, anything involving fertilised eggs ends up creating lots of spares that never get implanted. You generally make about a dozen of them and then pick the best to use for the attempted pregnancy. The rest get put on ice or thrown away or used in research. So even though PNT destroys a zygote by design, this is dwarfed by the number destroyed each time by practice.

I think the estimate is about 3000 per week are routinely discarded by fertility clinics. In terms of embryonic destruction, in actual clinical practice, mitochondrial donation doesn't add anything new to the debate.",null,0,null,1422848873,null,0,1422990315,0,co8e14s,null,t3_2ufss0,null,t1_co8e14s,null,t3_2ufss0,null,null,null,1424261590,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Okay on the first propsed XI, let's face it, Flanagan isn't going to be good enough. Solid defender, don't get me wrong, but not a lot going forward, which would be needed with your lack wingers. Next, when has Lallana ever played centre mid? A lot of people on this sub like to think he has for some reason, but he hasn't played that deep, not as deep as Coutinho.

My advise is just focus on our team... if you're just new and learning, there is just so much history to take in, from so many decades of dominance. Many dark periods too... 

Regarding being told to hate Everton: if you're not from Merseyside, haven't spent time there, or if you weren't really from there but were a fan in the 80's, it makes absolutely zero sense for an new/young/international supporter to hate Everton.... at least over a team like Manchester United or Chelsea.

Dzeko was also ahead of Negredo in the pecking order until he picked up a knock after the Norwich game where he scored a screamer and got us a point.  Like I said before..Negredo had a terrific few months and then an empty half a season and somehow manages to get more credit within this sub than Dzeko -who has delivered conistently.  Balotelli's performances and antics also seem to be more favorable to the fans than Dzeko's professional attitude - which I consider very Milner like in approach.

All that said, Tevez and Aguero are the only strikers on the team where Dzeko played third fiddle.  Let's be honest here...we let our best striker walk in Tevez.. But if you think that Bony is going to be ahead of Dzeko in the pecking  order you're out of your mind.  Where has Aguero been that last few games?  Like I've said before...Aguero needs Dzeko and Dzeko needs Aguero.  Bony will push Dzeko for sure, but to completely ride him off and summon him to the pine is absurd.

One of them picked up a godawful fungal rash from sweating and not showering for nearly a week; don't underestimate the power of a proper wash.

However, you don't necessarily need to go to an organised campsite, all you need is permission from the landowner to have all the experience of wild camping without any risk of getting into trouble. Getting that is possibly easier said than done, but it's possible if you're really stuck on the idea.

Do not start campfires on the ground. They get out of control much quicker than you think, and can end up causing huge amounts of damage, especially in the summer when it's dry. Use camp stoves for cooking, and if you're desperate to have an open fire in the evening, invest in a small firepit with legs and keep the ground beneath it wet.

""Again nothing massive to report. Would not be surprised to see a number of players go today as there has been interest in 10+. That said nothing is imminent, and it is very possible for one reason or another none of the them will leave. Lennon I am led to believe has become somewhat complicated for non footballing reasons(but can not go into that on here). That doesn't mean he won't go and is still the most likely to, but I was told he was pretty much done to Hull and that now is back in the balance. If the higher profile outs(such as Ade) go then we have players in mind to bring in today. Was also told that while we don't want to leave ourselves short, certain players(Ade again) will go even without the replacement in place, as Levy will not miss an opportunity to get him out, even if it is only on loan.


Asked about Alli, but my mate had heard nothing regarding his impending transfer. He did say however that he saw Poch just after he had gone to see him play against Yanited in the COC, and said he raved about him and how good he thought he was going to be.


We are very interested and could move for both Ings and Reid today, if the right players move on. Lambert is still an option we would look at, but Pool are desperate for players that they don't seem to be able to get close to. If the get the green light, I am told Lambert is the most likely out to make room.


I know it is very much a case of he might go and then again he might not, but that is just how it is atm. We have a lot of Irons in a lot of fires but until something specific happens out then nothing will happen in. There is sufficient interest in enough of ours to think we may do business today but how much is just not possible to say. All down to the how desperate the buying clubs are imo. It honestly could be a case of doing 4 or 5 deals today or nothing at all. Sorry it all seems so on the fence but that is the situation as i have heard it"".

It will take you only 2-3 hours and you will get a professional service in exchange. Hover, mop, sponges, windows cleaner and all the chemicals will be provided. We could discuss a photoshoot while you be doing it.
I think its a fair offer, if you are interested I can provide you with my portfolio and previous work.

It is very important that you leave the site exactly as you found it. Best to pitch up fairly late and pack up early. 

I think satanspanties is overstating the danger of camp fires though. So long as you follow basic common sense practice that is. Light the fire on bare ground, keep it small and well clear of vegetation/your tent, and be sure the ashes are cool to the touch before disbanding in the morning. If you site i all grass, you can excise a disk of sod, light the fire on the ground beneath and plug it back in the next day so as not to scorch the grass.

Balotelli might come good. If he needs a season on the bench, so be it. If he needs to be dropped all together for some time to understand that he is currently no where near the level the club expects then so be it. Sturridge had a reputation of being a it difficult and lazy resulting to him being somewhat invisible in matches. So did Coutinho at Inter. Inter fans(either at /r/soccer or this sub, don't remember) after his transfer to Liverpool decribed  him as magical at times but had a tendency to fade out of games.

Summary: If given the chance at the correct moment - Balotelli might show his true potential.

That said, the next obvious question is whether donors are required to be close family (on a quick skim through again, I don't think the Telegraph article says, and I've not looked further).

If mitochondrial DNA can influence any characteristic of a person, no matter how trivially, it could be considered a baby-step down a slippery slope.

Personally, I'm atheist so I really don't believe there's a Gods plan to care about, so I'm certainly not going to cherry-pick which things I want to be part of that. I also think that since modern medicine affects our natural selection pressures in the long term, eventually being born to any degree healthy will be a vestigial trait, so we'll either be born dependent on medicine to fix us or we'll need our own genetic plan for our descendants.

I realise that, I was just giving you something else to consider if you were wondering how much of a factor they play in forming our identity.

&gt; That said, the next obvious question is whether donors are required to be close family (on a quick skim through again, I don't think the Telegraph article says, and I've not looked further).

The answer to this would have to be ""no"" given that a female can breed with any other member of her species, meaning that her mitochondrial DNA sequence would have to be compatible with any nuclear DNA sequence within that species.

We also can in theory transfer mtDNA between closely related species. For example, if we were to resurrect the woolly mammoth, it would have to have elephant mtDNA (two species separated by 4.8 million years of evolution).

We have also successfully bred transmitochondrial mice by combining [Mus spretus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_mouse) with [Mus musculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_mouse) which are separated by about 1.8 million years of evolution.

The greater the phylogenetic distance between two species, the more respiration defects we're likely to encounter if we were to attempt transmitochondrial breeding. For example, this was done between rats and mice (25 million years apart) and while the offspring survived, there were significant respiration defects.

[This paper explores that relationship](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521860)

&gt; If mitochondrial DNA can influence any characteristic of a person, no matter how trivially, it could be considered a baby-step down a slippery slope.

It could, but there are a number of things that make this unique:

 - This doesn't involve tinkering with the genes themselves but rather is simply the act of combining organelles from one cell with the nuclear DNA of another.

 - This doesn't allow us to pick obvious optional characteristics like height, intelligence, race or build, it only allows us to eliminate certain diseases.",null,0,null,1422873380,null,0,1422874585,0,co8m3jn,null,t3_2ufss0,null,t1_co8m3jn,null,t1_co8lte7,null,null,null,1424257767,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Labour get put in charge of doing Universal Benefit right in exchange for them getting to change the spare room subsidy. With both parties backing it and providing scrutiny it is far more likely to be successful.

They could split the difference on the top tax rate and put it at 47.5%. On the economy by working together they could create a far more effective centre ground between the two parties.

With both parties combining to create a massive majority, things like Lords Reform, devolution to the regions, and boundary changes could be organised far more effectively and without as much brazen political positioning.

Infrastructure projects like HS2, Airport Expansion and housing would be far more possible and effective if both parties get the benefit and the NIMBY's are a less relevent part of the whole.

A core part of *all* basic income schemes is that they are broadly neutral for most people in good jobs. Their new income is offset by increased taxes, that leave them roughly where they started.

The net cost of the scheme is usually comparable with current welfare provision. Left wing proposers (such as the Greens) usually want to increase welfare spending as part of the scheme. Right wing proponents of basic income prefer to see it as a way of *saving money* on welfare, and *driving economic growth* (basic income can be seen as a sort of radical deregulation of the low/zero wage portion of the economy).

The issue is further education directly benefits those who receive it, whilst the more that have it, directly disadvantage those without.  Just look at job postings for 22 year olds, how many demand a degree with a suitable result.  It's almost a simple filter now.

This is why graduates earn more than non graduates on the whole.  As a result I don't think it's fair to demand those who didn't directly benefit, fund those that have.  It's wealth transfer in the wrong direction.

A core part of *all* basic income schemes is that they are broadly neutral for most people in good jobs. Their new income is offset by increased taxes, that leave them roughly where they started.

The net cost of the scheme is usually comparable with current welfare provision. Left wing proposers (such as the Greens) usually want to increase welfare spending as part of the scheme. Right wing proponents of basic income prefer to see it as a way of *saving money* on welfare, and *driving economic growth* (basic income can be seen as a sort of radical deregulation of the low/zero wage portion of the economy).

I saw that Lambert, according to the press anyway, said that Villa 'gave up'. I don't think that's the case. After a slow start Villa went all out against Arsenal are were pressing a lot. Chasing every ball, three players surrounding any Arsenal player in possession and even sprinting towards Ospina to try and force a mistake. I didn't think Villa would be able to last but, at the start of the second half, they continued to do the same thing. 

No team can keep that up for 90 minutes and sure enough when the second goal was conceded Villa let up. I think that is natural when you've been working flat out like that and then you concede and the deficit gets wider. At 2 - 0 down the game was over bar any extraordinary increase in performance and so it was natural. 

It's a bit rich for Lambert to say that the team gave up after the shift they put in. I mean they did let up but really they were probably knackered and demotivated following the second goal. 5 - 0 only reflected a collapse at the end of the game.  

Your problem from my limited experience of watching Villa was that you had no real attacking threat. Aside from corners and one cross in the box towards the end of the first half you never look like bothering our defence.

&gt;Greene King's ongoing business expansion has sometimes been the subject of criticism. As a result of its active acquisition policy, it has come to be known by beer protesters as *Greedy King*  (or *Greed/Greede King*). The British [consumer group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_group) CAMRA, claim that Greene King is in danger of becoming a [monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly) by buying out other breweries and thus potentially limiting choice for the pub consumer.  These claims are based on the fact that Greene King proposes the [buyout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyout) of these breweries while not promising to continue the sale of the current range of ales. Production of key product lines has previously often been switched to Bury St Edmunds while lesser brands cease production. Groups like [CAMRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_Real_Ale) generally oppose such brewery closures and any loss of variety in cask-conditioned, or ""real"" ales. The growing consumer reaction to this shift was demonstrated towards the end of 2006 when a pub in [Lewes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewes), East Sussex started a well-publicised protest against Greene King for removing the locally produced [Harveys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harveys_(brewery\)) Sussex Best Bitter from sale, while continuing to sell other guest beers.

Full Lineup 

DJ Mach One &amp; DJ/MC Ribbz.
http://www.mixcloud.com/MACHONE/
After holding a few warehouse parties in Amsterdam in 1990, DJ Mach One returned to the uk &amp; founded the original dreamscape events in 1991 before creating revelation in 1992.

One of the uk's first underground music clubs and arguably the largest of its time, it prided itself on an open minded attitude to music.

The cream of the uk's underground music scene spun records alongside a rotating roster of the south west uk’s finest dj’s, the club was held at verbeer manor in the Devon countryside for over 3 years and succeeded against the odds in establishing itself as a mecca for cutting edge music, attracting up to 800 people a week from across the country, it gained some notoriety when it appeared unjustly on the tv’s roger cook report in 1993. 

It then transferred successfully to a much larger venue (2000 capacity) the legendary plymouth warehouse ,where it held court until June 1994.

Well we haven't changed policy here in Scotland...

And they haven't dropped the policy as a long term goal anyway, they are basically admitting they can't make the sums work at the minute but would like to aim for the policy in the long term. Still a shambles though. You don't use your first major spot on national TV to launch a new policy without having it costed first. 

The 'hippy' factions are still far to strong in the E&amp;W greens. We never really had the same culture in the greens up here, or at least the experience of actually having a say in the Scottish Parliament has professionalised the party a fair amount. Both of our MSP's (who are our conveners i.e. leaders), Harvie and Johnstone are  pretty slick media operators and the party doesn't have most of the batshit insane policies that the E&amp;W greens have. 

Patrick Harvie in particular is excellent. But we're gonna get tarred with the same brush as the E&amp;W Greens, somewhat understandably, by the media. I hope that it doesn't damage our chances in 2016, we are looking pretty promising for double digit MSP's and a chance to really hold some significant influence in parliament.

Israel also contentiously annexes territory which doesn't belong to it.

No, because I'm not an idiot. You are not understanding this. It's not anti-semitic to criticise a state. I'm not anti-Chinese when I say that the PRC is immoral, I'm not anti-black when I say that Mugabe and everyone who helps him run Zimbabwe is a cunt, I'm not anti French when I say Hollande is a shitty leader.

Criticising the actions of a country is not discriminatory even to the people within that country, let alone to an entire ethno-religious group, some of which have decided to live in that country.

Your total failure to understand this categorical difference is quite disappointing. Israel as a state intentionally conflates opposition to its actions with discrimination against jews as a group, in order to essentially make it immune to criticism and make out that anyone who does is an evil racist.

Sleek, makeup academy, and makeup revolution are equivalent in my mind--very good for the price--but are kind of tricky to find a lot of stock in-store.  Sleek has some good eyeshadow and blush palettes that I can vouch for--the blushes are super pigmented and last a long time. Makeup academy does a 'smokin' palette that is a dupe for urban decay's one; the colours are all really pigmented and the texture is nice and soft/blendable.  Makeup revolution has a lipstick called 'rebel with cause' that looks like Mac's rebel; they have a pretty good range of lip colours for cheap but the quality is pretty average. All three of these do better on powder products (shadows and blushes) imo.

Soap and glory I haven't tried makeup from, just bath/lotion stuff. I've liked a few of their scrubs and stuff--they smell really good. Nothing super special though; I prefer the body shop personally.

Bourjois's healthy mix foundation is one that gets recommended a lot. I have one but it's not quite right for my dry skin. If your skin is more combo or oily I think it's better. I have a blush of theirs, too, but it's not my favourite.

If you like wetter mascara formulas, I have good luck with maybelline, but you might have that where you are. Obviously benefit's they're real mascara gets a lot of love too but I haven't tried it myself. Benefit has some good concealers, too, a bit on the pricey side.

null,false,threejoinedrings,null,null,null,"&gt; I'd rather that they lowered housing benefit 

Housing benefits only pay up to a certain rate per person based on the area - for example a single person under 25 can only get up to a certain amount that's based on them sharing a house. Children under 10 (I think?) are expected to share rooms between two, and children under 16 (again, I think?) are expected to share two per room if they're the same gender. They don't just say ""yeah sure, take a 6 bedroom house for the two of you and we'll pay it all if you lose your job"", they won't pay enough for the most expensive houses in an area either, it's enough to get rent in a fairly basic place of roughly the right size for your family.

As you say, it's landlords charging more that's the problem, not the people living there - they need somewhere to live and if they can only find places to fit their family at the housing benefit maximum, then that's all they can live in. Many people don't have the mobility to move to different areas due to work, medical issues, children, etc - if you're struggling to find rent then spending your money on commuting (either getting a car and paying insurance, taxes, repairs, petrol, or by public transport) isn't a great option, especially if the government can help you live somewhere that means you wouldn't have those costs. A better way to control that costing would be rent controls, not necessarily lowering housing benefit, because that just means that landlords will constantly sit at the maximum they can get, or just rely on non-housing benefit people, whereas rent controls can mean that no one is getting fleeced and while landlords might sit at the maximum they can charge, it doesn't screw people over as soon as they get a job and don't get housing benefits anymore because it's set at a reasonable cost, rather than just what the government can afford.",null,0,null,1422878110,null,0,false,0,co8n0u8,null,t3_2u3ik4,null,t1_co8n0u8,null,t1_co57y6l,null,null,null,1424257335,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

It's not perfect at all but it generates *so much* energy and such a reasonable cost whilst generating little pollution. Safety is a concern but if you look at Fukushima that was an *older* plant hit with a *succession* of natural disasters and where pretty much everything that could go wrong, went wrong. Yet the after-effects are limited to a contaminated area and no deaths. Even the long-term cancer risks for those near the plant at the time are only marginally increased vy single-figure percentages [at worst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster#Risks_from_radiation). Also let's remember this was a older, less safe, plant hit by conditions we can't get here. 

I think their plans to scale back growth, putting us in a intended recession, are mad. I think the logic behind growth being unsustainable is wrong. We can develop cleaner ways to generate energy, less energy intensive technologies, and leaps forward in farming to help with food. We are actually doing this now. Increased use of electric cars, increases in clean energy, less people are dying because of disease and famines and in western nations we are starting to reduce pollution. It's actually cleaner to live now in Britain than it was during the industrial revolution. The key goal is to generate a source of energy so powerful that we can power space flight to colonise other worlds. The human race is designed to keep moving forward. Ironically the Greens are opposed to two technologies that help sustainability: nuclear power and GM foods. I think this is the hippy factor. Just because they can't imagine a sustainable world doesn't mean it cannot be done. We're always making moves towards it. 

I could go on but it's a bit long already. Generally I think the Greens are at odds with the modern world in a bad way.

All schools should be taught the same thing at the same time, maybe even on  the same schedule.

I work in the electricity industry, and the way in which, particularly on reddit nuclear is hailed as the *one true solution* is disturbing. It is not the easy fix many think it is. Also Scotland really does not need nuclear energy, so it makes me much less uneasy over my difference of optinion on this matter. On a pan european level, however I think we do need nuclear in the short term. 

Our position on GMO's is much more nuanced: 

&gt;The Scottish Green Party supports the value of genetic
engineering techniques in appropriate medical applications (such
as the production genetically engineered human insulin for
diabetics who previously had to rely on bovine insulin). However,
extension of patents legislation to living matter and naturally
occurring genomes is unacceptable on the following grounds:

&gt;a) The proposals imply a relationship between humans and
nature where it is acceptable to manipulate life and to
own living things;
b) The patenting of life raises ethical questions regarding the
value of human life, notably with the transfer of human
gene sequences to other species, and the patenting of
naturally occurring genomes can undermine the rights of
developing countries;
c) Farmers will become dependent on patent holders,
primarily big industrial corporations. Monoculture will be
reinforced and genetic diversity lost. Traditional animal
husbandry will be economically and legally disadvantaged;
d) This legislation will increase pressure to release genetically
engineered organisms into the environment, with
unknown effects.


However I disagree on the 'growth' point. The whole point of the disagreement with the constant need for growth is:

&gt;Continually increasing industrial output, waste production and extraction of finite resources cannot be sustained given the limits of those resources and the impact of human activity on climate change.

It doesn't mean we mean to ban progress, it just means we want to structure the economic system in such a way that it is not reliant on continual growth and resource extraction to stop the appearance mass unemployment and economic misery.

&gt;Your ignoring the point, that one is given universally to all. Just because you were not there, does not mean that you would be excluded if you had children.Same with roads, you can just hop on them whenever you wish.

Anybody can go to university - provided they're smart and diligent enough. There is universal access. 

&gt; Just look at job postings for 22 year olds, how many demand a degree with a suitable result. It's almost a simple filter now.

For an office job, because there's an oversupply of people who want office jobs. Someone without a degree is the norm in trades, and those guys are doing fine. Finish your apprenticeship and become qualified in the trades, and you can start making more than almost all of your degree holding mates very quickly.

&gt; This is why graduates earn more than non graduates on the whole. As a result I don't think it's fair to demand those who didn't directly benefit, fund those that have. It's wealth transfer in the wrong direction.

Well, if graduates earn more than non-graduates they're paying a disproportionate amount of the tax take, so in essence they would be funding their own policy themselves anyway.

I'm a strong believer in education, so it's not like I'll do a Scotland and make HE free while fucking FE over, so that people who want to upskill and don't want or need degrees can't do that. But I view education like the NHS - the genius of making the NHS free is that it in the long run saves the country money, because it encourages people to go to the doctor if they think something is wrong with them, instead of ignoring it and being admitted to the hospital. 

Make education free and you've encouraged people to upskill and train themselves to face economic challenges better than if they were ignorant, passive, and left high and dry if industry changes.

[Case in point](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2ufqb0/nearly_18000_people_have_petitioned_for_the/) this is extremely patriotic, but it feels genuinely accommodating to all - that's the difference, and why it works well in america IMO.

Why do they have this accommodating culture?

- they have *clear*, values to what it means to be an american - ideas of civil rights, freedom, hard work/american dream.
- they understand their history, i.e. founding fathers, colonialism, natives, and land from mexicans, so less fear of immigrants as they understand they're all immigrants.

In Britain we don't have a sense of those clear, unifying, meaningful values. It seems being british is more defined on activities ([types of arts &amp; sports predominantly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom)) - although all cultures are in part defined by activities - having values being a clear part of a national culture is what makes patriotism work, because it's truly accommodating.

A culture being defined by activities makes it harder to be patriotic because not everyone likes the same activities, instead we say some are more working class, or middle class. A meaningful truly encompassing aspect of being ""British"" should be clear, identifiable values &amp; ideals, it's what works for America? 

If being British was strongly associated with values, it'd work.

I'm dyslexic, heavily.  Last time I was tested I had the spelling age of an 11 year old (I was 20 at the time).  My reading and comprehension was above average for my age however.  I also had a very strong leaning for certain maths and spacial awareness things.  In some ways, I'm genetically gifted, my ability to play with half coloured cubes earned me a four figure grant, not wishing to brag, but when it comes to playing with toys for 5 year olds, I'm really that gifted.

I have an aptitude for certain things.  I will better many people who study hard, spend ages looking at a puzzle in a heartbeat, because the solution is there just as clear as I can comprehend the visual input.  It's obvious to me, yet I'm completely oblivious to say drawing the number 3 and the letter E correctly, I'll see them as interchangeable.  Aren't learning disabilities fun!

I was moved as quickly ahead on my degree as accreditation allowed, I was even being paid by the uni to run tutorials for my peers.  I scored the highest mark ever on an assignment I wrote in less than an hour, drunk and stoned, in a lab because I'd forgotten it was due.  The reason I knew is because someone called me because they were stuck, my other course mates were not impressed by my behaviour.  I only lost marks for spelling and grammar, being the mildly socially inept dick I was I immediately submitted a formal complaint that it should have been 100%.  The next highest mark was 70 something by someone who had worked apparently rather hard.

Yet at the same time, I spell like an 11 year old.  Won't notice if some letters are backwards, can't remember how to spell a word whilst I'm focusing on the form of a letter.  Fucking fun isn't it.  Suffice to say school didn't really work for me until A-level, uni only worked because of some very understanding and interesting tutors.  The real world worked very well for me.

No matter how much effort, how many hours spent practising handwriting or spelling with different techniques, I've demonstrated no improvement.  Yet at the same time, I'm effortlessly better than some people who've slaved away studying for hours at certain other stuff.

null,false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; I work in the electricity industry, and the way in which, particularly on reddit nuclear is hailed as the one true solution is disturbing. It is not the easy fix many think it is. Also Scotland really does not need nuclear energy, so it makes me much less uneasy over my difference of optinion on this matter. On a pan european level, however I think we do need nuclear in the short term.

Well I am not sure it's the one true solution. I just think it's the best solution for now. I like the idea of solar energy becoming better but I think it's still quite far behind. We need to drastically increase the efficiency of the panels themselves. Thankfully big strides have been made there but it's not enough. When the technology matures I like idea of most homes generating enough energy to power themselves from panels of their roof. 

I think nuclear currency occupies a sweet spot between energy generated and population caused. 

As for Scotland I don't think it matters. I view it was a UK wide issue irrespective of Scotland become Independent or not. I see little need to separate the two. I think even the SNP wanted a pan-UK energy deal if there as a Yes vote. It makes too much sense. 

&gt; It doesn't mean we mean to ban progress, it just means we want to structure the economic system in such a way that it is not reliant on continual growth and resource extraction to stop the appearance mass unemployment and economic misery. Which I don't think isn't particularly contentious.

The office of fair trading advises that requiring your tenants to get contents would be viewed as unfair and is unlikely to be enforceable.

* Seems like your letting agent isn't very good. They're obliged to give you your landlords address, it may be worth writing to him directly with your problems.

* I'd say it's unlikely you'd be able to break the contract given the above issues, They're all quite easily fixable. I'd try and negotiate a discount this month.

null,false,Leetenghui,null,null,null,"Ah teachers you say? I am a teacher of sorts.

Pull up a chair we have much to discuss.

Anyway in no particular order:

**What subject you teach can/will affect your workload considerably.**

There is something called contact hours and non contact hours. Pay is supposed to consider that each hour of contact time has at least an hour of non contact time. This usually means a higher hourly rate. Some contracts such as supply don't give you any consideration of non contact time.

For example if you teach maths prep work isn't all that difficult as maths is well maths and it doesn't change. You can also mark maths homework relatively quickly as each question follows the same pattern. Feedback is a matter of check boxes. Student A+B+C can do area X+Y+Z student D can't do area X but can do Z etc. Recycling in maths is easy.

Same thing with PE teachers I know. Homework? no such thing... OFSTED paperwork yes. Lesson prep still happens and they have to fill in reams of paperwork to satisfy H&amp;S and OFSTED. Feedback to students tends to be short and curt. Recycling is easy.

The 'softer' subjects are where it gets tricky. English for instance. English work tends to snowball. For instance you give your students a writing exercise for homework. You have 4-5 lessons a day you've got 150+ essays to read, mark and give feedback on which can seriously suck up your time. Some recycling is possible but government doesn't like you recycling and it shows up on lesson observations.



**Pay/conditions**

Deteriorating, as above you get paid contact time and non contact time. A lot of schools are run by business men who think ah we'll only pay for contact time sack the rest. This is normal in 6th form colleges where many I know are ZHC.

Conditions getting worse because of the ever rising bar of paperwork which needs to be done. When I was a boy feedback was a few words on the bottom of your homework. Now things like individual learning plans need to be completed as well as 10-15 mins one to one tutorial sessions to 'give ownership of learning' to the students. This all adds up.

**Long holidays**

You can take as much holiday as you want! Typically schools will hire you in August for Sept then let you go before the summer holidays. Contracts will state X number of contact hours. Many schools hire on term contracts so they don't need to pay you for the non teaching in between. Colleges all hire you on disposable contracts. You teach X a week you get paid Y for each hour. All the marking etc is done in your own time.

6th form colleges are now being trendy and offering 4 terms a year so summers aren't spent off.

**responsibility**

It is ALWAYS your fault. So you get a violent child who smashes things up, your fault. 

Your students get poor grades it is your fault.

Class doesn't show up it is your fault (your lessons aren't interesting enough to engage them is a common one).

Peter principle is common... so you're a good teacher! you should be head of department! Nell for instance a bloke I know he is a great teacher really good he knows his subject inside out. He is however a terrible manager.

**Violence**

In colleges is quite common, but not often reported. Expelled students = black mark on reputation of the college and a cut in the funding. So they don't expel them.

There is a running gag partly which you don't know how serious it is or not. Whereby as male teachers we typically never leave the view of the CCTV cameras. A certain college has no cameras in some of the lifts and we don't use them.

**Uselessness of the qualifications**

6th form colleges are experts at this. I cite my source as the Wolf Report by Allison Wolf. Essentially colleges offer useless qualifications which PREVENT students from getting jobs. This forces them to go back to college to study more worthless qualifications. This essentially allows them to game the old funding system to maximise their revenues and keep a captive audience.

**The future**

More zero hour contracts, more paperwork, more scrutiny, more funding cuts, more ambitious curricula yet less funded time to do it. 


**Teachers and those who become teachers**

The attrition rate of those who do PGCE is pretty high anyway. Many individuals do it because they don't know what else to do. Fat government bursaries tempt them to do such things. On the course I completed there were 43 trainees. At graduation there were only about 26 of us left. Within a year there were &lt;10 of us teaching. Within 2 years about 6 of us. It has been a while and I've lost touch with many of them.



YMMV of course but many don't make it through the hazing stage. Where they put you with the worst classes possible to test your mettle.

We need to drastically increase the efficiency of the panels themselves. Thankfully big strides have been made there but it's not enough. When the technology matures I like idea of most homes generating enough energy to power themselves from panels of their roof.

Solar is useless in the UK. We have some of the lowest irrandiance anywhere in the world. Solar power is already incredibly efficient, it is just not storable. The real benefit of solar would be in the creation of the European super-grid; with massive solar farms in Spain and north Africa augmented by pumped storage in the Alps and Scandinavia and wind from Scotland. 

But the point about Scotland was that the SGP will never be in a position that should affect a nuclear plant that *should* actually be built. The number in the party who support nuclear is not insignificant either, I am hoping the membership surge post referendum will increase the chances of tacit support for nuclear power outside of Scotland. 

&gt;I think it's too ambiguous then. I would want to see what that means in practise. A lot of advances, i.e Telsa Motors, are made as a result of capitalist motives.

We don't propose the abolition of capitalism. We are in favour of cooperatives, but the main point about the opposition to growth is that is a principle that supports other decisions.

But they aren't. They work 7am-9pm every day. No amount of money would make me work that for my entire life. Its an unsustainable career. 

Most of the time overflow is them doing box-ticking exercises, only to be told their are shit. Its not a good motivator.

**Edit:** Since alot of people are complaining of hyperbole, I will clarify that this is my experience with my family and friends who are teachers (around 10 people). They are all motivated to do the best for their students, which ends up costing their personal lives. I am aware that teaching has gotten worst in the last few years, it wasn't always this bad. I am also aware that not all teachers work this much, but I get the impression they are considered subpar teachers for it. Teaching is a job where you can never get every student to full marks, so its easy to spend your entire life trying.

Also I am averaging the hours. I've seen days where they are up til midnight marking, and all weekend. Then other days where they truly are ""free"" after 4:30 when they get home.

It is a crazy situations though. In my job, I will rarely do overtime and still be considered a good employee by working well within the confines of the 9-5 day. As a teacher, working like that would make you pretty bad. Taking work home after work and during holiday, coming in early and staying late - these are expected and required if you want to achieve anything for your students.

My issue is this,.. It is becoming clearer every day that this was well know about within Parliament. There are reports of it from the 70s 80s 90s and we know it is still going on. The current investigation keeps being stalled so that people can die before their names get dragged through the mud.

So my issue is that everyone in that building who knew are just as bad as the persons doing the crime. These people are meant to be protecting the people, instead they band together protect themselves against the people they are meant to be standing up for. Think the Whips little black book, detailing most likely 30 year of blackmail material. 

I think it is clear that the whole of the current government is rotten to the core and has been for 30+ years; The powerful people behind each party knew all about this, but it gave them more power over others so they kept it quite. M15/CIA/Russia, impressive I wonder who really currently controls are government. I going with the CIA with help from M15.

What I believe

An election cannot fix the rotten core of parliament, only a complete removal of the 2 biggest parties and all their members could pave the way for a real democratic party that represents the people. 

It is very clear, all those in power will protect themselves and those around them over the people they are meant to represent. We have had 1 or 2 people try and stand against the parties over the last 30-40 years, everyone has been discredited or call a conspiracy nut. 

The UK has no hope, at least before the internet we did not know. Now we all know but finally starting to wake up to the fact that the democratic process means little if anything in its current context. The abusers will keep abusing because they are untouchable. If we ever get an untouchable in court, I bet they could spill the beans on nearly all of the upper elite in the UK. 

This is the secret that binds the elite together,

I guess it just seems strange to me as it's like drug decriminalisation - it reduces some of the risk, but leaves the danger of it still being unregulated and in the hands of criminals.

Therefore it can only serve to potentially increase the market size and thus the power of the violent criminal organisations that currently run the trade.

Legalisation just seems better for everyone. 

(And it's worth noting that there are a lot of feminists that strongly support legalisation as they see it as liberating a woman to do as she likes with her body and that regulation would free the trade from pimps etc.)

Gerrard has been released despite having retired from international football *to prolong his LFC career*. Not feeling heavily favoured I suspect. 

I think what you are identifying is something else - that BR takes a fair amount of time to figure out people and system issues before acting. It's like each season he starts again with 433, assuming that his new players will finally deliver. And then they don't and we spend half a season getting up to speed, often in an entirely new system. 

There was a nice piece of analysis, linked on this sub a while back, that suggested that this was true at Swansea too. He has a pattern of late season improvement as he figures out people and process. 

What I want to see is a more settled squad once Aspas et al gone and only a few newcomers each season. See if BR can maintain from the end of one to the beginning of the next.

Basic income would make more sense if it simply replaced JSA and ESA. Giving it to anyone who works or receives a pension doesn't make sense. It's also too high at the moment for many people to even vote for it. 

If they wanted a viable basic income plan, they should make it £60 a week flat payment to all unemployed people (With increases linked to inflation every year.), with the current means test of no payment at all if you have over £16,000 in savings.

&gt; 25 or over up to £72.40

A flat payment of £60 would mean people would still qualify for the full housing and council tax benefit (Although some local councils now charge a small percentage to benefits recipients.). It would mean that we would save hundreds of millions on bureaucracy of not having to constantly check up on the unemployed: even more when we reduce the huge workforce of the DWP. And it would be a low enough amount that it would not be a viable lifestyle choice for long periods of time.

Sure, there's always going to be people who will be happy to sit at home all day and collect their £60 a week. But these people will be few and far between. £60 a week isn't a lot of money to last the week. It's incredibly difficult to survive on that amount of money for long periods. And you're certainly not going to be living the high life on £60 a week.

Either they will have a whipping system where all MPs follow their party line, making them nothing but talking puppets, or the party line is pointless PR.

* MP gets elected
* MP has opinions
* MP is member of party which relates to their opinions.
* Leader can occasoinally whip to party position, but otherwise MP is a free agent.

Green party policies seem to ignore all of this.

If you work in a busy school, well you can forget your PPA time, because you'll be pressed into cover work.  Yeah it's not supposed to happen.  Yeah it does.

Some schools require lesson plans to be submitted for every single  lesson.  Imagine having to give your boss an hourly plan of what you intend to do all day.  Oh yeah, then you'll probably have to split each of those hourly plans into three or four different plans if you want to differentiate between academic abilities in a way that'll get you an Ofsted pass for your lesson. 

After planning all this work, you'll be expected to teach all day, then leave school and mark the work to a satisfactory standard.  

If an Ofsted inspection week is coming up, expect your workload to increase by about a third to a half as upper management shit the bed and make everyone back fill work that's been missed, or re-do stuff that's not up to scratch.

Teachers get a good deal over some things (holidays) but people who claim they don't work long hours for their money are people who know jack shit about teaching.

His game, what he's good at, is not what we ask our strikers to do.  He's a very good player in the right system, which is a 2 striker setup that gives at least one of the forwards a very free role with minimal defensive responsibility.  We ask our forwards to be very disciplined and they have a massive defensive burden to shoulder.  We also ask our forwards to play on teir front foot, to look to get in behind and run aggressively off the ball, which Balotelli doesn't naturally do (he'd rather drop deep and hold the ball than move it on quickly or directly).

I like Balo a lot and I really want to see him succeed here, but unless he can completely change his game physically and mentally he's always going to struggle at Liverpool.  It was clear before we bought him that he's basically the opposite of the kind of striker who flourishes with us, and thus far his performances, as well as the team's performances with him in the side, have only reinforced that.

Lately he's shown that he's trying very hard to adapt.  He's been much more positive and has even been pressing properly a bit, which is a very good sign.  I have hope for him, but I'm still skeptical.  as I said, I really like Balotelli a lot and if I had to pick I'd prefer that he finds himself at Liverpool.  I think Brendan can make him into the right player, but Balotelli himself has to want to make the change.

I also think our chasing down Ings is a sign that at least 1, probably 2 of our current strikers will be moving on in the summer.  We've got Origi coming back in as well (though he's really more of a winger/second forward, he surely is lumped in with the strikers for us).  I'd expect to see Borini and Balotelli moved on in the summer, giving us Sturridge, Ings, Origi, Lambert as our 4 forwards with Sterling also able to fill in.  If we go for a bigger name striker as well (which I think we need to do) then I think we'll end up with 5 strikers since it won't make much sense to let Lambert go early anyway and he seems happy with a bit-part role.

I really hope this summer sees a lot of the surplus players like Aspas, Alberto, etc moved on and just 2-3 really good signings (a keeper, midfielder, and striker, in that order) come in.

The example given by the BBC website for my career path would end with me earning £70k/yr by the time I'm 50 (an average in my industry). The impact on me isn't really that much, I'll pay back £2000/yr on average for a much higher pay than if I hadn't got my degree. The amount I'll pay is jack compared to my income. It's ridiculous to even believe that these payments will be able to cause me to never own a car or house. To provide something personal my debt will be around £65k when I leave (added in interest) and a car will definitely be less than this unless I have a change of mind. However my loan debt won't burden me like a typical loan would and I'll still be able to go about buying stuff almost as if it weren't there.

The thing I find ludicruous about this is the amount of burden these non-paid debts will have on future generations. My case is one of the higher income cases so imagine how much will be left behind by others.

&gt; Is there some higher calling that compels you?

To answer this personal 'attack'. No there isn't.

I was thinking about Harry earlier, I was thinking about how he was exactly what us Spurs fans needed in one player. 

We desperately needed a striker to help our performances on the pitch, to be our danger man. But more importantly we also needed a player who connected with the fans, made us feel closer to the team in this time of commercialisation, over-pricing and stale PR. Harry Kane really fucking is one of us, he loves Spurs like I do, like we do. 

I thought about; if you had told a Spurs fan that they could magic up any player from their imagination to join the squad it would be the player that Harry has been this season: a striker that scores lots of goals, in a varying range, who works as hard as he possibly can and who loves the club.

Now regarding his statements :  The question I want to ask people on this sub is why do you care about what he says ? Do you believe what Mourinho says in his press conferences ? Did you believe what Fergie said ?   

Do you really think after a match in which we lost , Rodgers will go in the dressing room and say ""lads your commitment was outstanding , i cant ask anything more from you"" . Offcourse not .. the fact is what is said in the press and what is said to the players is completely different . All good managers do it , Rodgers is learning that trade as well .

He called himself 11 in Lodger, Moffat actually mentions that but glosses over it for some reason. But I agree that he is basically just 'The Doctor' and numbers are meaningless/unnecessary. Clara calls him 11 a couple of times but I guess she's not an authority on it.

&gt;John Hurt's character is ""the War Doctor""... that's what he called himself.

He never called himself that, that's just an off-screen name for the audience. A decent one at that. He certainly didn't call himself the Doctor, though maybe everyone else did. I like to think that they all just called him 'Captain Grumpy' during the war.

War Doctor sort of doesn't count because he wasn't really 'The Doctor'...but then again he is at the end of DotD.

If you were going to be really anal about it, War would be 9, 9 would be 10, 10 would be 11 *and* 12, and 11 would be 13. But fudge that. Let's just stick with 'War Doctor'.

null,false,Ritvp,null,null,null,"hey there, I have a few pointers for a CV:
I have experience in Engineering and finance job searches, so I can give you an idea of how those type of CVs should look.

Finance:
-Overall Short- try to keep to one page
-Start with a profile of yourself, like an executive summary, keep it to only a few lines.
-outline education, just mention grades, schools/universities and dates, no need to go into to much detail
-next outline work experience, only go into depth on the best/relevant/most recent experience you've had, dont forget to write the dates etc. And use alot of buzzwords, like, problem solving, analytical thinking, organisation, leadership, teamwork, liaising with seniors, high pressure environment. these are really good competencies employees will look out for in finance. 
-then write a small section on your computer skills and relevant extra curricular activities/hobbies and interests, keep it relevant, no need to go into alot of detail about all the sports youve played, instead choose one particular sport and make it sound good, for example leading a team, or organising tournaments/ training sessions. Also volunteering is always a bonus.
-Finally write a few references, if you dont have enough space, just write the names and include their companies, the write, references given on request.

For engineering/ technical roles
-i think you can do up to 2 pages for your CV, and at uni outline a few relevant topics/projects you covered. emphasise your tech skills and soft skills here. Other than that, pretty similar format to the finance CV i discussed above.

It is very true one of the major dividing points within feminism is sex workers.

They use it as an example now on different views women/feminists have and tricky side of cataloguing. I feel nowadays more feminists are siding on the pro sex worker side, but there are still those who think it's part of oppression.

&gt; According to the Foreign Office, 17.1m British nationals go to France every year. Meanwhile the French authorities put it at 12.6m, while our own Office of National Statistics (ONS) – which one would hope is the most reliable source – believes there were 8.85m visits (both leisure and business) made to the country in 2013. 

&gt; In fact, if you take the ONS’s word for it, we now love Spain even more with their spreadsheets showing 11.49m Britons went there in 2013. That's a figure accepted by Abta, the association of travel agents and tour operators, who believe Spain was already proving more popular than France way back in 2002. But France will always be up there. As Abta spokesman Sean Tipton says, “Ever since the British starting heading overseas for their holidays, France has been among their favourite destinations… millions of UK holidaymakers still head off over or under the channel each year.”

The Clifton Lido is a nice treat, sort of somewhere between a regular pool and a spa, they have fancy coffee and food so might be a nice alternative if you prefer that kind of thing.

If your grandfather had a lot of valuable stuff (antiques, collectables etc) call a local auction house for advice - they may have someone who can come over and do a valuation for you. 

 If you have a few valuable items/collectables then box them up and take them to the same said auctions house on a valuation day.  To find  respectable auction houses ask locally - someone will know - there are usually only a couple in each area (depending on where you are in the country). 

If you can be bothered then white goods, furniture etc can be dealt with the same way (sold in a general auction). 

To get rid of any other items (including white goods, furniture etc if you like) you can do it yourself - sending them to various charities etc.  Otherwise find a house clearance company who will do exactly that - clear the house.

I'm exhausted. Planning, marking 120 books a day and lots of other little bits of paperwork mean I often work 8am-7pm every day. I work through lunch too so that's 11 hours without a break (sometimes no food). I go home, I plan some more lessons. 9PM rolls around, I stop working, shower, get some dinner and go to sleep.

I love teaching. I love working with the class I have, they're a great (if a little mischievous) bunch and watching them grow up every day reminds me why I turn up to work every day. But the workload is my life now, and I am slowly becoming depressed as I have little to no time to do the things I want to do. I am close to quitting. I was working til 10:30pm one night during last term when I just broke down and started hating myself. No job should do that to someone.

EDIT: Thank you for all the lovely words. It's reassuring to know I'm not alone!

For the amount I'll owe for my degree when I've finished it's pretty damn likely that I'll never pay all of it back.
Those statements seem to be at odds with each other.

Again I refer you to my initial statement. The way a student loan works isn't the same as a normal loan. The only way it affects me is that I'll pay 9% of whatever I earn over £16,910/yr. It doesn't affect my credit status and it gets wiped clean after a certain amount of time after graduating.

That part then leads on to the second part you highlighted. I'll more than likely never pay it back but at that point all it means is that I stop repaying it and the debt is handed over to our government.

&gt; Oh - it wasn't an attack at all. I'm genuinely curious about these things.

I apologise if so. As the other person said (in reply to my comment) the money part of a career path is only so much, enjoying what I do and feeling accomplished is just as important to me.

&gt;
&gt;__GameJournoPros__ is a now-defunct private Google Group consisting of 150 writers, bloggers, and editors from various game news sites and media outlets. The mailing list, group members, and various leaked email conversations have sparked online discussion in the video game community regarding writer collusion and journalistic integrity in the ongoing Gamergate controversy.  
&gt;The group's existence, and the veracity of the email leaks, have been verified by the group's creator, Ars Technica Senior Gaming Editor Kyle Orland. 
&gt;GameJournoPros, according to Orland in one of the leaks, was inspired by JournoList, a private Google Group consisting of several journalists and academics, the media exposure of which resulted in Washington Post reporter David Weigel's resignation.

However, cycling repeatedly day after day isn't as simple, your body will hurt and you will feel exhausted mentally and physically. Some people find this pushes them on, others get beaten by it. My advice is to do a few test rides with all the gear (bags full of dead weight if necessary) but make sure you do this practice on consecutive days, it's no help if you do a test ride of one day and decide you're fine, then on your trip you find that your wrists hurt on day three so much that you have to abandon.

Also, specifically to the UK, there are websites for cycle touring that list campsites and hotels/hostels that are bike friendly. It is worth using these places because the alternative is hotels etc that do not understand the needs of cyclists and so don't offer a safe place to lock the bike etc. Britain does have a problem with bicycle theft and while you will likely be fine it is sensible to prevent theft as much as possible.

Lastly, there are hills here and you might benefit from knowing how to avoid the worst of them. Again, there are cycle touring websites, forums, and apps that can help. Sometimes it's worth going a little bit out of your way for a nice flat stretch, such as the Somerset Levels if you're riding up from Exeter past Bristol. 

As for your daily target of three hours riding, I would expect that after a few days of so much time not cycling you'd change that, again it depends on circumstances (weather and daylight hours) but long distance cycling is addictive so be prepared that after a few days you might start cycling 10 hrs per day and fly through the whole trip a lot faster than expected.

In Afghanistan, as an example, the vast majority of long range support was provided by Americans.

If we didn't have them around, we didn't have all that much in the way of long range support. We did, but perhaps in some of the more remote areas, less so, though most of our combat action was sustained in the Sangin and Helmand provinces, so it's not like we often needed support, say, around Kabul. It was often close at hand.

As the other user said, a common way of dealing with snipers is to literally just fire everything you've got at them. A single sniper, well deployed, can take a lot of manpower to find and can often cause a lot of casualties at the cost of a single individual, maybe a pair. The Taliban had no real way of dealing with effective use of snipers, short of maybe a man-packed mortar, if available, and that's assuming they could A) find the target and B) effectively lay down rounds to displace or destroy the sniper.

My point is that your not seeing 5 Rickie Lambert posts after every win or leading up to every match.  If Balotelli was being shafted by BR, and had put up some real solid performances than noone would be detesting putting Balo in.  Unfortunately, he isn't performing up to the teams standards, a lot of LFC supporters still see him as lazy and uncreative (something I can't disagree with).  Putting him in just because he's Balotelli, and is going to be productive because he now has one of the top scorers in the PL last season? At the cost of sitting productive players, who are in form?

He *could*- if he tries hard enough, and recruits enough allies - change existing British law and existing European regulations. He can even hope to have some influence (however limited) on the way this is legislated in the States. 

He *cannot* legislate mathematically-intractable problems out of existence however. 

Strong encryption is strong because of mathematics. The policies of governments and companies are utterly irrelevant to whether or not it works.(This is *exactly* the reason he can pretend to want it banned, incidentally). 

His advisors, and probably DC himself, are perfectly well aware of this. It's incredibly naive to think otherwise. What they want to do is *criminalise* people who *use* encryption for non-approved purposes. 

What they are trying to achieve, by shifting the tone of discussion in the media, is initially to make private use of encryption somehow *reprehensible*. So that fewer people use it, and it's less readily available.

Then - after a few more years and a few more terrorist outrages, maybe throw in some ""think of the kiddies"" scandals for good measure - it'll become illegal to use encryption for private purposes, outside of mainstream sites which are already cock-in-glove with the authorities. 

That's when the majority of young and politically active people become criminalised, even if they're never arrested and never investigated. Because that's the hold over people that authority seeks to achieve.

null,false,scwol,null,null,null,"**Using the bus:**

1) Wait at bus stop. Aim to be there at *least* 5 minutes before the scheduled time - even earlier if it's not a frequent service. Timetables aren't very well adhered too and the bus may be early.

2) When you see your bus approaching, attempt to make eye contact with the driver and nod, and possibly raise your arm.

3) Ask for the ticket you want.

4) Take your seat, unspoken rules dictate you should avoid sitting next to someone if at all possible, and fill up from the back.

5) Shortly after the bus has left (or driven past) the stop immediately prior to your destination, press one of the 'Stop' buttons. If you're steady on your feet, consider making your way towards the door.

6) If you leave by the door next to the driver, most people will say 'Cheers' or something to that effect. Don't bother if it's a rear/middle door.

**Tickets:**

Single: One journey from A to B. Ask for ""A single to [destination], please"".

Return: One journey from A to B, and one journey from B to A on the same day. Ask for ""A return to [destination], please"". Keep the ticket when you get off, and just show it to the driver when you get on the return bus.

Day ticket: Unlimited journeys within a certain (usually quite large) area, within the same day. Ridiculous bus pricing can mean this is very close in price to a return, the driver may well point this out to you. Ask for ""A day ticket, please"" - no need to specify destination.

**Payment:**

Bus drivers have access to a limited pool of change so they can get a bit funny about having to give you lots of change in return. In general, I'd try to keep it within 50p of the actual fare. Exact is best, but it can be very difficult to look up bus fares in advance.
