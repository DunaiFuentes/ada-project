I'd like to if I may recall one conversation with a female friend of mine, over many many years, for it took that long to change how I felt: She told me fourteen years ago of how her father was regularly taken from the family home, stood in the street and questioned but never arrested, and much more tellingly of how she, as a girl of eight, EIGHT fucking years old, was spat upon by policemen and soldiers passing her in the streets where she grew up.

I am a cynical old bastard, believe me, and for those past years I would often hear the same things said and spoken about in quiet moments, waiting to hear a contradiction to what was said before, after so long I can only come to one conclusion, she wasn't lying.

null,false,why_am_i_itchy,null,null,null,"&gt; You do realise teenagers are impressionable, and often do stupid things right? 

The same can be said about the vast majority of adults. So he's a victim is he? I suppose your reasoning is that he was likely fed a lot of lies and 'taught' to hate. I certainly don't argue with that, but again, the same can be said for many older people. But of course they are not considered victims because they are inherently different on account of having lived for slightly longer...right.
If he is considered a victim then so must every other person who has done the same, unless it can be proven that they were not victimised. So, I guess all that's left to ask is this: Do you consider every suicide bomber to be a victim? 
If you say no, I would ask you why someone older (but similarly conditioned) would not be also deserving of our compassion... but if you say yes then I wonder where we draw the line for personal responsibility? Not all teenagers are more impressionable than the average adult and not all adults are less. 
  
My perspective is as follows:  
  
I think that because we do not know the specifics of his circumstances and the events of his life that led to this, that we are not qualified to judge whether he, or any other suicide bomber is a victim or not. I therefore suggest that the label is somewhat meaningless and doesn't add anything to the discussion. It's basically a value judgement, it's saying that it wasn't really his fault. But we don't know that, because we weren't there. I consider it arrogant to make a decision and slap on a label while having such little information to go by. The only insight gained from this is a look into how people perceive terrorists, youth etc and how people view personal and moral agency. Calling him a victim is presumptive and serves only to appeal to a sense of inalienable social responsibility that's constantly being shoved down our throats.",null,1,null,1434319414,null,0,false,0,cs6jmbq,null,t3_39tvo0,null,t1_cs6jmbq,null,t1_cs6excg,null,null,null,1437001120,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

That they use scaremongering and intimidation to get you to buy one, even when it is not necessary?

I'm pretty sure Sun Life's letters don't say ""we wouldn't want anything bad to happen to you, so you better pay up""...

&gt; If you can't take steps to know your rights, something is wrong. The thing that matters is people doing things without question.

&gt; If someone isn't knowledgeable, why would they have a TV and no License? 

Because they don't want to watch TV, maybe it's in a cupboard, but don't want to get rid of it? That they have a monitor for their computer that happens to have a TV tuner that has never been used? Plenty of reasons really.

If you are aware of the law, then it is still a nuisance to get these letters (or have someone knocking on your door). You presumably don't like junk mail or door to door sellers or jehovas' witnesses at your door. Why would you want the BBC doing the same things?

&gt; Most people believe you have to have a licence to own a TV, and that misconception isn't because of 'threatening' letters.

It's because of misinformation, which includes those extortion letters

Seems to me like you either haven't watched much European football the past few years, or you have the memory of a goldfish.

Judging by your comment history you're seem to be pretty irrational and quick to jump to conclusions when it comes to discussing football and football players.

By who? me? I never said that. In fact what I did say was:

""I mean Christ, I look at grown adults who are part of the EDL with plenty of pity, let alone the kids"" in a reply to another redditor who actually took the time to ask me what I think.

How others respond? Well that's their choice. I certain pity bigots, I feel sympathy if they've grown up in semi-abusive environments which has shaped them to be bigoted. If that's not the case then I pity their lack of intelligence for being bigots, or violent racists, or whatever you want to apply to people who essentially make our world that little bit shittier.

Everyone is deserving of some sort of compassion, because that's what sets us apart from utter monsters who view others as subhuman. Now that doesn't mean the justice dished out to those monsters should be lessened, or diminished. We all have to take responsibility for our actions, regardless of our backgrounds. 

I wasn't saying it wasn't his fault, simplisitically or otherwise. I wasn't implying any of what you are asserting I have said, through imagined inference. I am simply stating that we are all products of our own experiences, and in a lot of ways you can attribute victimisation to someone who straps a bomb to themselves. But as I say, does that mean they should be granted immunity from justice? No, of course not. That's not how justice works at all. I am a humanist, that's all.

And it certainly doesn't mean we should prioritise the bomber over the victims...that would be insane.

I think I've answered all of your points, in a roundabout way, haven't I?

So maybe I can ask you why you've been contributing to a holocaust denial thread? Great stuff, that post history.

You are kidding me right?  

&gt;A nation is for its native citizens  

And for them *alone* I assume. Yeah... this is the attitude that got my friend spat at. I'd sooner live in a country that has ""accepted the destruction of their culture and national identity"" rather than a country who believe there are the natives and those beneath them. Germany had that phase in the past; didn't go so well for them.  

&gt;We already have laws to stop them, but some still make it in.  

Then wouldn't we bet better enforcing those laws, rather than perpetuating constant anti-immigration rhetoric?  

&gt;That doesn't make illegal economic immigration OK.  

Did I ever say it was? I believe in giving the UKBA more money to carry out their jobs, rather than the scapegoating of people who are here perfectly legally. [Read my own damn comment on that video; I think it should be clear what I think there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/39t6oq/british_passengers_of_a_bus_record_a_crowd_of/cs6d0dv):   

&gt;I once spoke to a UKBA agent who I happened to get chatting to in a pub in London.
In his words: there have been so many cuts since 2010 that nowadays they only catch the ones they are specifically looking for, and even then have trouble. There's no resources left for doing random sweeps and actually finding all of the illegals that have gone missing.  
The government have been a lot of talk and no action on this.

You're obsessed with Kool-Aid. I'm in this for the profits and the increased diversity of goods and services, not to be ""nice"". I'm rather partial to Polish bakeries and low cost, high quality German cars, not letting all 7.whatever billion people on Earth live off of British benefits as it seems you believe I want.  

I already said those are illegal economic migrants. Completely different from perfectly legal EU migrants, or perfectly legal non-EU migrants, but that doesn't fit your way of thinking so ignore it.   

Those are illegal, non-EU, unskilled economic migrants which I don't want to enter. The EU supplies us with all the unskilled migrants we need to keep our lives in working order at the level to which we have become accustomed.  

We *need* unskilled migrants to do these jobs. You try getting the *British* off their arses to do such jobs. Another friend of mine owns a shop; posted a job advert. Got not one single British reply. When the jobcentre sent some over they refused the hours, or the pay, or the list of responsibilities. But should he be forced to hire a British person who clearly doesn't want to be there over an Italian who was just grateful for a job, simply because they're *British*? As it happens the Italian is doing great and is the best employee he's ever had.  

Also, if people don't want *any* unskilled immigration, and the lowest number of others physically possible entering so as to retain as much ""Britishness"" as possible; I implore them all to join UKIP. They made their stance on immigration pretty clear and it lines up perfectly with what you're saying you believe so I don't know why you'd be against joining them.  

I join the Liberal Democrats ages ago because it aligns with my views; others should do the same.

&gt;

&gt;The __Heysel Stadium disaster__ (pronounced: [ˈɦɛizəl]; [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language): *Heizeldrama*; [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *Drame du Heysel*) occurred on 29 May 1985 when escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall in the [Heysel Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium) in [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels), Belgium, before the start of the [1985 European Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_European_Cup_Final) between [Juventus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.) of [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) and [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) of England. 39 people—mostly Italians and Juventus fans—were killed  and 600 were injured by Liverpool [hooligans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooligan). 

&gt;Approximately 1 hour before the Juventus-Liverpool final was due to kick off, a large group of Liverpool fans breached a fence separating them from a ""neutral area"" which contained mostly Juventus fans. The latter ran back on the terraces and away from the threat into a concrete retaining wall. Fans already standing near the wall were crushed; eventually the wall collapsed. Many people climbed over to safety, but many others died or were badly injured. The game was played despite the disaster in order to prevent further violence, with Juventus winning 1–0. 

&gt;The tragedy resulted in all English [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) clubs being placed under an indefinite ban by [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) from all European competitions (lifted in 1990–91), with Liverpool being excluded for an additional 3 years, later reduced to 1,  and fourteen Liverpool fans found guilty of [manslaughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter) and each sentenced to three years' imprisonment. The disaster was later described as ""the darkest hour in the history of the UEFA competitions"".

Sorry mate, you lost me completely here. Are you taking a pop at my credentials here, or Ed Snowdon's?

&gt;I'm not saying it's highly probable, I am saying it's possible, and very far from ""no conceivable way"".

I never said it was impossible, that was someone else. I think you might be arguing the toss with the wrong person mate.

&gt; Debian, one of the most widely used Linux distributions, was basically generating only 32,768 different random numbers for the better part of a year - two, if you count the unstable/testing versions, and nobody noticed. Or at least, nobody mentioned it. Good random numbers, if you don't know, are kind of critical to drive any encryption algorithm.

You really are clutching at straws here. That's still more than enough to encrypt stuff securely with, especially when you consider that Snowdon has encrypted the data in chunks, with different keys.

&gt;If you're that flippant about this stuff I suggest it's you who doesn't ""know how AES encryption works"".

Now now, no need to get your knickers in a twist. For someone who is conflating my argument with other people's, I think it is a bit rich you are having a pop at Snowdon's attention to detail being slack!

So, a subscription model then? I don't care what we call it - I understand what you're saying, but my point is that it's more complicated and more costly to implement than funding through general taxation.

&gt;&gt; Yes, their implementation is poor and the BBC's needn't be, but all of these systems are intrinsic inflexible and prone to error.

&gt; I can't agree - and it's a pretty weak justification as to why ""everyone should pay""

It's not a justification *on its own*, but it is definitely true that any sort of system where you limit access to ""eligible users"" is compromise between flexibility and the degree to which it's open to misuse and fraud.

&gt; Yes, by giving them the burden of increased taxes or the lovely upsides of decreasing spending somewhere else to find £4bn+ for the Beeb, and without giving them the option to not pay at all, like they have now.

The overall amount of money that the BBC receives would be lower than what it does currently, so you wouldn't be making an ""overall saving"". But what it will mean is that the same overall cost is spread evenly across the population, unlike what happens now where those who don't pay, yet still use its services, are subsided by those who do pay. Also currently, the amount that you contribute personally depends on how many other people live in your household - a single person living on their own pays the same amount as a family of 5 does.",null,0,null,1434320439,null,0,false,0,cs6k51x,null,t3_39rutb,null,t1_cs6k51x,null,t1_cs6j3xx,null,null,null,1437001520,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

After being arrested she was taken to the station and a strip search was performed. This is something the police can do if they believe you have something on you that poses a risk to yourself or others. Not unreasonable given how they'd found her. The thing we can be most certain of is that the police didn't handle this well.

As for the conversation in the hospital. The officer said she was well-spoken, so presumably they had something of a conversation before the officer said this. Although the victim woke up with no memory of what had happened, when did their recollection of the day stop? Did what was said and/or the victims demeanour cause the officer to believe she'd may have had her drink spiked?

The fact the officer noted she was well spoken at this time, suggests she hadn't been previously. Had she actually been capable of talking during her arrest and stay in custody? If she had been speaking, but sounded different (and not just drunk), did this make the officer curious about where she was born? The officer radioing after this doesn't actually tell us much without knowing everything that was said.

I do have a few added issues, if you don't mind me jumping on this. 

My ex and I have children and a fairly amicable parenting relationship, and also own a house together, which she lives in with the kids, but I don't, but we don't want to sell yet, or potentially ever, and I'm still paying the bulk of the mortgage as I don't begrudge my kids a home and it's also an investment. 

If like to get divorced just to get it done with, but without this changing the terms of current arrangements. Also, I don't begrudge my ex things like insurance payouts which would automatically go to her if anything happened to me, as things stand, would divorce change these, or would some sort of arrangements need to be made?

Basically, we've been separated for over five years now, and I want to divorce, mostly because it's an awkward situation to explain to people, but don't especially want anything to change in terms of informal agreements or the house. I *think* she'd go along with this, but we've not talked about it. 

I would prefer to just hand it all over to someone else to sort out, but my worry is that my ex might get a solicitor who'll try and push her into getting more out of me, or make it more expensive.

Have thermal scanners or whatever and teams ready, the driver comes through, puts his hazard lights on to indicate that he believes there are stowaways in his truck, team enters and extracts them to detention centres. Job done.

I suppose one thing might be to upgrade the transport infrastructure through some of the country's most populous regions. I suppose an upgrade to the motorway network might be one option there, but going forward, I'd really like to see more people using public transport for all the environmental and personal benefits it can potentially bring. Maybe a new railway line could be one option there. One with relatively modern, high-speed trains that could connect cities like London to Birmingham and get people back and forth between the two in record quick times.

Looking elsewhere, well, there are certain things about the wider world that concern me. I live in Scotland, and one thing that particularly concerned me about the Independence referendum was Russia's interest in promoting a Yes vote, especially considering their recent history. Maybe I'd invest that money in funding 10-15 years of a nuclear deterrent, just to help keep us safe from potential threats. It'd be a lot of money, I know, but I expect the majority of it would be spent on wages, helping to stimulate the economy, as well as keeping our lands safe from military threats.

I'm not sure, though. To be honest, I'd probably just arrange with /u/M3lancholia to go halves on that Freddo. ",null,0,null,1434324525,null,0,false,0,cs6m56l,null,t3_39ujgm,null,t1_cs6m56l,null,t3_39ujgm,null,null,null,1437003112,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null
null,false,896321475,null,null,null,"Firstly, the £100bn you quote for Trident is a lifetime cost. So that includes the development of the submarines, warheads, leasing of missiles, maintenance, salaries for scientists, engineers, submariners etc etc. So over a 40 year lifespan, it is more like £2.5bn per year. Of course there will be a few years with higher upfront costs, then many years afterwards with slightly lower costs, but it will be about £2.5bn per year. Nothing in the context of a government budget. It isn't like it will all be spent in one day, or even in one year. To put it in context, if current spending plans remain the same, over the same 40 year period about half as much will be spent on free TV licenses, the same will be spent on the winter fuel allowance, over twice as much will be spent on JSA, and over three times as much on the foreign aid budget. 

There are similar arguments for HS2. 

This is my major problem with the way that these figures are reported. That figure will be compared directly with, say, the NHS needing another £8bn of funding for a year, and people start thinking that you can just fling £100bn at the NHS instead of spending it on Trident. It just doesn't work that way. 

So if you were to spend the £100bn allotted to Trident differently over 40 years, I suppose that you could build an extra 50000 houses a year assuming that each house cost £50000 and the land was free. 

To be honest though, I'd rather build the same amount by scrapping the winter fuel allowance instead. Or at least build a few less by making in means tested. Same with the free TV licences.

null,false,nkrera,null,null,null,"I honestly can't see it happening within at least the next 50 years (if Northern Ireland continues to remain part of the UK for that long).

The tribal and fractious nature of Northern Irish politics is always going to be a significant stumbling block. Even the limited powers that have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly by Westminster cause trouble as it is, despite the fact that the Assembly exists in a state of permanent, mandatory power-sharing and that we are roughly 20 years into the peace process.

Also, the fact that none of the Northern Irish parties are UK-wide means that Northern Irish MPs are always a tiny, disconnected minority at Westminster. This, coupled with the geographic and cultural separation of Northern Ireland from Britain, means that Northern Irish social and economic issues are never of any serious concern to a British Government, let alone to the vast majority of the UK electorate.

The Northern Irish electorate are therefore effectively cut off from the rest of the UK politically. For example, in last month's general election the Northern Irish debate was a once-off, 20 minute affair, the contents of which received very little media coverage, and none of the Northern Irish parties were invited to take part in any of the leaders' debates. This segregation means that - except in the unusual and rare situations where either the Tories or Labour might need a handful of Northern Irish MPs to secure a majority in the House of Commons - meaningful developmental legislation for Northern Ireland is not typically included in a programme for government. Also, as recent history has shown, any significant changes that are agreed upon in Northern Irish legislation result from near collapses of the Legislative Assembly which are resolved only through bilateral negotiations that necessarily involve the Irish Government under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.

In my view, these are all factors which would strongly discourage foreign direct investment into Northern Ireland - it is nowhere close to even approaching the kind of stable political environment that is a prerequisite to attracting meaningful levels of investment.

You also have to bear in mind that while unionists/loyalists want to remain part of the UK, nationalists/republicans want to see an end to Northern Ireland as a political entity. Although this may or may not change over time, it's not exactly a reassuring thought to a potential investor that a single border poll could result in fundamental political and economic change (and possibly even violence) that would potentially have a strongly negative impact on their business.

One also has to bear in mind that the strong reliance of Northern Ireland on the UK taxpayer for employment through the public sector means that fundamental and sweeping changes to the economic structure of the region would be required to produce any meaningful potential for economic self-sufficiency. This itself is a long term project, and the more time passes without reducing the scale of the public sector in Northern Ireland, the harder this task will become. I get frustrated when I hear people talking about streamlining the public sector in Northern Ireland and attracting private investment - they say it as though it's trivial and something that can be achieved quickly, when in reality shrinking the public sector would be a long and painful process, and there is unlikely to be any significant private investment in Northern Ireland without a significant amount of political will and support from Westminster and Dublin.

I think that one of the only realistic ways in which the economy could be ""normalised"" in this way, could possibly be via a series of cross-border economic initiatives and incentives produced via significantly increased British and Irish governmental investment through bodies like [InterTradeIreland](http://www.northsouthministerialcouncil.org/index/north-south-implementation-bodies/trade_and_business.htm). Without significant seed funding from the British Government, or cross-border cooperation in Ireland, I would be of the opinion that Northern Ireland is simply too economically undeveloped and potentially unstable to have a realistic chance of attracting sufficient investment to generate enough wealth for it to be economically independent, or even economically stable, on its own merit.

Whatever way I look at it, I personally have huge difficulty in seeing Northern Ireland as anything other than a total failure as a social, economic and political entity, and genuinely can't see things there changing in any meaningful way for at least another generation - the divisions in Northern Ireland run too deep and are far too prominent to enable meaningful social change to occur at anything quicker than a snail's pace.",null,0,null,1434324995,null,0,1434334461,0,cs6mdb8,null,t3_39uhq4,null,t1_cs6mdb8,null,t3_39uhq4,null,null,null,1437553997,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

You could also use that argument to say that we are better off combining resources with the French for a nuclear deterrent - we already do with the US quite a lot otherwise our costs would be higher.

I think there's some services that society just doesn't need and it just creates a lack of social connection or pride. It creates a social divide mentality that's been perpetuated since the middle ages, looking out for people who can play that game well. Passing it down to the next generation.

Many hours of our day spent doing something that you don't want to be part of. Doing it for the money as a means to enjoy things in life.

I'm being vague because it's a monstrous task with so many things to consider, but it seems to me society's social issues is the 800lb gorilla in the room that needs solving with the problem rooted in capitalism where you have money as the motivator to sustain living standards. Antidepressant usage is just going up and up.

It's such a complicated issue which involves so many political buzzwords.
I do think however a good way that addresses community would be to invest in space, it seems reminding us that we're all here on this rock together can humble you a bit I think. Would be good for the rich folk that run society &amp; basically decide a significant portion of many of our lives for us.

Hmm I think nature &amp; studying it is a great way of bringing people together, it is truly universal isn't it? transcends language barrier, ethnicity, nationality, no need to make jokes that are based on hurting each other just for entertainment (like the anti ira chant at the football match). What if everyone just discussed the natural world to entertain each other, wouldn't that be interesting? I guess some social communities do that, why can't that be for all? Why can't we all just dance &amp; play games &amp; be entertained in a manner that brings many of us together inclusively, that doesn't have class &amp; social identity barriers of entry.

The cheapest UK option is [SR Skincare] (http://www.sr-skincare.co.uk/30ml-10-vitamin-c-serum-25-p.asp) at £4.50 and honestly it is much better formulated, more stable and gentler than OST. Stronger is [Active Formulas] (http://www.activeformulas.com/products/15-vitamin-c-serum) at £10.50. There are other products with a different form of vitamin C around the same price, such as [Ishtar Skinlights.] (http://www.ishtarskinlights.com/skin-treatments/vitamin-c) For this form of vitamin C it is so concentrated I dilute it to make is spread further/ last longer.

I'm not sure if the info provided by the the dslchecker will be of much help, as I have had an 'acceptable' service shall we say in the past, such as the random highest download rate we've had as 600 kb/s or so, but has been very choppy and unreliable, dropping below 100 kb/s as if it has a mind of it's own. That and I can't get the link to work as well lol - I'm not sure if I've gone down that route as well in the past though, and were given some brilliant statistics, but in reality, had nothing near what they said I was supposed to get.

Master socket - I am not sure we have one? I looked into them, and if I understand correctly, they have an inbuilt test socket? None of our sockets have those. We have been using the socket in the living room for our main landline use and where the router is connected to, and dub that as the 'master socket'. It's also where BT engineers have come to check for faults in the past as well, and the same socket that was 'fried' with lightning a while back, but since replaced.

Router related/rebooting - wouldn't a physical reboot (turn off and on) be enough for this? If so, we've done that many many times, and it doesn't seem to have any affect at all. We've had to do it more frequently lately, due to what we call the 'yellow triangle of death' appearing on our computer's network status on the desktop. Sometimes it tends to kick the internet off when the phone goes as well, that's something new that's only started happening a few weeks ago.

Wifi - wifi related stuff doesn't really apply to us, as we use wired connections from all PC's and devices to the router, with exception of the one or two tablets that are connected via wi-fi occasionally, but not on all the time. Even when they are off, and it's just one computer on the network at the same time, there is no difference in the poor speeds.

Regarding Superfast Cymru, I think we tried to apply for that or at least show interest in it. Like yourself, we'd jump on the chance for fibre optic when it was available, but I can't quite remember how that went. I believe we were rejected, or told that the area was still 'under review' or something, and it never came to light - still waiting.

I'm a bit confused with the exchange then lol, as I'd always thought the big metal box was the exchange, could that be the roadside cabinet then? Though, that box seems to supply telephone connection to the whole village by my understanding. There's always a member of BT there at least once a week or two fiddling with the enormous amount of tiny wires inside it.

From the article. Here's the reply from the female scientists who have either collaborated with and taught by him.

&gt;&gt; By the end of the week, however, several female scientists and commentators had written or come forward to defend Hunt, including plant biologist Professor Ottoline Leyser, of Cambridge University and a fellow FRS.

&gt;&gt; “Tim taught me as an undergraduate and I have known him for years,” she told the Observer. “It is quite clear to me that he is not a sexist in any way. I don’t know why he said those silly things, but the way his remarks have been taken up implies that women in science are having a horrible time. That is not the case. I, for one, am having a wonderful time.”

&gt;&gt; Hunt was also supported by Dame Athene Donald, professor of experimental physics at Cambridge, who described Hunt’s sacking from the ERC as hugely sad.

&gt;&gt;“During the time I worked with him he was always immensely supportive of the ERC’s work around gender equality. His off-the-cuff remarks in Korea are clearly inappropriate and indefensible, but … he has worked tirelessly in support of young scientists of both genders.”

&gt; That the spies know what they are doing.

&gt;It is a belief that has been central to much of the journalism about spying and spies over the past fifty years. That the anonymous figures in the intelligence world have a dark omniscience. That they know what's going on in ways that we don't.

&gt;It doesn't matter whether you hate the spies and believe they are corroding democracy, or if you think they are the noble guardians of the state. In both cases the assumption is that the secret agents know more than we do.

&gt; But the strange fact is that often when you look into the history of spies what you discover is something very different.

&gt; It is not the story of men and women who have a better and deeper understanding of the world than we do. In fact in many cases it is the story of weirdos who have created a completely mad version of the world that they then impose on the rest of us.

He's a martyr. An example. If we sternly stopped him in his tracks, I'd say otherwise, but we didn't. He killed what? Almost half a dozen people and we fail to condemn properly. We shouldn't be emphasising the loving nature of a teen who just flew across the world to kill himself with a few others, for a few others. Don't liken him to us. He *was* one. Isn't any more. Not that ""he fell under a spell"", but that he was corrupted, or we're not attacking the behaviour, but defending an image.  We should justify any sympathies, make it the normal, but twist them to normality to avoid alienating the undecideds and compassionate. We should be stressing that there is some clearly wrong though. *A kid deviated into extremity, and dangerous and worthless behaviour.* We should, especially for the relevant communities (where such youth will more often radicalise), alienate the branch in behaviour, but not the origins, so it seems out of touch. For one, contradict it with the Qur'an or something. Make him a deterrent. Not a narrative for an unwelcome presence. We should be sure to counter any rhetoric of social injustice by first acknowledging *a* problem and then suggesting some reform (loose, uncredited and ambiguous of course). We need to appear responsive. Which the article clearly lacks (and, with controversy, the BBC). Back on topic. His views will succeed and precede to many of similar nature If this theme of literature becomes dominant. I personally find that this case, with the article given, is humiliating our values despite a victory, which is evidently not the case, being in arm's reach.

&gt; The family, from a predominantly Asian area of Dewsbury, said the IS cause was not supported by the Muslim community. They said: ‘The entire family unreservedly condemns and abhors all acts of violence wherever perpetrated.
&gt; ‘As a family we would like to take this opportunity to unequivocally state that ‘‘ISIS’’ are not Islam. They do not represent in any way, shape or form Islam and Muslims and we are no longer prepared to allow a barbaric group like ‘‘ISIS’’ to hijack our faith.’

...which is a pretty healthy message about Muslims for them to be putting out there, I think.

Long answer - Become an innovation nation. Simply put, have a secular public sector, no mandatory religious schools, have a scientifically literate society. Teach everyone (young and old) how science in the last 300 years has improved our quality of life in astronomical ways. 

I.e. Instant communication to anyone around the world. Fly to anywhere around the world in a plane at 30,000 feet travelling 500 miles per hour. All of these things only happen when people are educated and put their education to practical use and start innovating. 

Investing in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) will create the people that create innovations that create industries that don't even exist now and create lots of jobs in the process. 

Yes, this doesn't happen over night this takes decades but it's a sustainable way to grow the private sector here and until we as a society push the government to invest in education more and for parents to help bring up scientifically literate kids then we won't see any positive changes in the NI economy.

You have to apply through the UCAS system, which will require you to write 1 personal statement (that is very different from the university applications I've seen some of my American friends write). It will be 1 page and completely tailored to the 1 subject of your choice, as it has to be sent off to 5 universities of your choice, all of which you will be applying for the same course (e.g History).

I'm highly sceptical of their methodology, to say the least. The most recent estimates place phase 1 at £16.3bn with an additional contingency of £5.8bn guaranteed in case of overruns. This is to be spent in annual increments rather than a lump sum. Including wider economic impacts, HS2's BCR will be 1.7 for phase 1 and 2.3 upon completion of phase 2. That's still a net gain for taxpayers and ""high"" value for money with a BCR &gt; 2.0. 

No one against HS2 has been able to provide a longer-term solution in lieu of the proposed design. We've spent a fortune on WCML improvements that resulted in minimal time saved and lower-than-expected capacity increases. Nearly all main lines into London will run out of slots even with Network Rail's planned upgrades and numerous regional lines will experience the same problem as ridership far exceeds our ability to increase capacity.

&gt;The __Limitation Act 1980__ (c. 58)  is a British [Act of Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament) applicable only to England and Wales. It is a [statute of limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations) which provides timescales within which action may be taken (by issuing a claim form) for breaches of the law. For example it provides that breaches of an ordinary [contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract) are actionable for six years after the event  whereas breaches of a [deed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deed) are actionable for twelve years after the event.  In most cases, after the expiry of the time periods specified in the Act the [remedies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_remedy) available for breaches are extinguished and no action may be taken in the courts in respect of those breaches.

null,false,FinalEdit,null,null,null,"&gt; You haven't answered my original question, are they (adults) victims or not? If they are, then by that logic EVERYONE in any way involved is a victim and now the word becomes meaningless. If not, then you meant what I inferred and thus your point here becomes moot. 

You are being a bit pedantic to say the least.

Anyway it's you that's ascribing a meaningless value to the word ""victim."" 

I don't believe in demonising other human beings. If I was religious I'd be using Jesus as a benchmark for forgiveness and acceptance above and beyond all else. 

As I'm not religious, let's just say that yes, victims everywhere. 

If you can't see that a 17 year old kid, who's bought into a poisonous idealogy off the back of some psychopathic cunt's twisted teachings as a victim, I think you need to reevaulate your life a bit.

So then you ask me to look at the psychopathic ""teacher"" in this equation, ie: the adult....fine, let's do that.

Scenario 1: Psychopathic dude is psychopathic, meaning he was born without a concept of empathy as defined here:

""sometimes distinguished from—sociopathy (we'll get to that next), is traditionally defined as a personality disorder characterized by enduring antisocial behavior, diminished empathy and remorse, and disinhibited or bold behaviour""

In this situation the monster is *born* not *made* - so this guy is a victim of a cruel synaptic condition that's out of his control. Is he dangerous? Definitely. Does that put him out of the realm of justice and criminal retribution? No. Should we pity this guy who essentially doesn't have the brain chemistry to care about right and wrong? Most definitely. What's he a victim of? Well, bad luck, it seems, at the very least. Should we slit the fucking guys throat? Well, no...not unless there is absolutely no other possible choice. Should we lock him away if we can? Absolutely. Is he innocent? No. Is he a victim still? Of course. He is absolutely a victim of a neurological condition which he has essentially no control over long term.

So let's move onto the other situation. The guy's a sociopath, as defined here:

""Researchers tend to believe that sociopathy is the result of environmental factors, such as a child or teen’s upbringing in a very negative household that resulted in physical abuse, emotional abuse, or childhood trauma.""

(source: http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2015/02/12/differences-between-a-psychopath-vs-sociopath/)

This is obviously a lot easier to ascribe victimisation to. I would call the killers of James Bulger sociopaths, when you look at the wider context of the killer's backgrounds (disadvantaged, abused, neglected etc). In our hypothetical situations, it's obviously impossible to tell because we're making it up as we go along to prove a point. Either way, sociopathy is most certainly attributed to victimisation through early years.

So that basically covers the most extreme forms of people being utter monsters and lacking on any scale empathy for other people. 

If anything you can accuse me of, it's feeling empathy for everyone in this situation. In light of what I've said I don't believe that's a bad thing. I certainly don't think it diminishes the other victims nor does it make the word ""moot"". I think you ascribing a value to this whole thing, as though there's a points based system by which adults who should've known better don't apply to beyond a certain age is childish and frankly insane. 

Especially considering that when I say that everyone is deserving of some sort of compassion you say:

&gt;That's nothing more than opinion, in other words your view is as valid as mine is as valid as the next person's...

Whilst that may be true, that exposes you as quite a cold person. That's ok though, I don't really care. I just think it provides an insight into the kind of mentality I'm pointlessly arguing with on Reddit. You can call it my opinion and disregard it all you want, and that's your choice - I was never speaking for everyone which was evidenced with I also say that ""people can react however they choose to"", in my original reply. From my view, compassion is important and is what sets us above those who believe that others are subhuman.

I pointed out your holocaust denial thread because again I think it shows you up for the kind of person you are, a looney conspiracy nutjob who's contributed a bunch of controversial stuff more in line with your average bigot than most. Again, do I care? Well no...but putting together the bigger picture I find that ultimately I may be fighting a losing battle with you because frankly you're adversarial enough to keep coming back and back and back with this sort of bullshit. And the fact that I have to explain compassion to you and how it is indiscriminate (at least, to me, but realistically to a lot of people), says a lot. 

I'm sure you're gonna come back with loads of ridiculous examples that I have to somehow mine through the internet and prove that somehow they are victims of something, which is just stupid and I'm not going to do it. At this point I feel great compassion for my Monday off than I do for arguing with someone who clearly has emotional issues. Just keep your pitchfork in it's USB charger for now eh?

His two spells at FC Köln are were his reputation was built.  He went to Bayern München in between, started well but faded as Hitzfeld (the Bayern Manager) favoured playing Toni and Klose together. 

Although he was a hero at Köln (and was all over the press wanting to go back there when things didn't work out at Bayern), he once again decided that Köln wasn't a big enough club for him, and took up Arsenal's offer, where, once again, he's hardly set the world alight. 

So, what can I say.  On his day he's a pretty decent player, who can occupy a left wing or striker role.  He could probably do a decent job at Everton, but he's not in his first flush of youth having just turned 30.   If we could pick him up for a cheap price, sure, go for it.

1. Martial actually got 14-15 (out of his 19) starts as the spearhead striker last season. That means we should rather judge his goals compared to other strikers, rather than to other wingers.

2. A big worry to me is his lack of assists. A combined 4 assists over the last two seasons is actually quite underwhelming. 

I know he's still 19, but as the OP is using stats to show how good he is, it's interesting to note several sides to those stats.

&gt;Look at all this bullshit with OpenSSL. We've built an absolute shitload of infrastructure on top of it in the past few decades, and it's turned out to be a pile of crap people can't wait to escape from, and somehow hardly anyone noticed until it was far, far too late. Certainly it's not because the entire industry is full of clueless idiots.

It does however, mean he has knowledge that most people don't, especially of zero day things like POODLE etc. The mechanics of those vulnerabilities and how they present themselves are also not present in AES encryption. Perhaps a keylogger on his device, maybe, but cracking AES is just not happening in the same way. A lot of the reason things get cracked is due to them sending and receiving data from external sources, whereas an encrypted file just sits there waiting for the local user to access it. I don't think Snowden would be leaving his laptop with all the files on it connected to wifi and just left there.

And the spelling is my damn phone's autocorrect. It clearly thinks the man is Mt Snowdon or something. 

&gt; We're having a discussion in a comment thread, and that was part of the thread. It isn't all about what you've said personally :/

well that's just not something I'm going to open. Suffice to say that yes, cracking AES is technically something that *could* be done, but realistically speaking it clearly hasn't.

&gt; .. no, that's actually completely deadly. Pretty much all of the security cryptography provides boils down to the statement ""I'm thinking of a number between 0 and 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,935, I bet you can't guess what it is"".

&gt;If you can only think of 32,768 different numbers, an attacker probably can.

you're making the classic error of assuming meta-knowledge on the part of the hacker.

This is not an excuse, this is a matter of historical record.  It is a fact.  Mortgage fraud was *endemic* in the US in the runup to the crisis, and was one of the main causative factors.  There was fraud in the selling of mortgages, and probably fraud when the ratings agencies failed to properly investigate the quality of the underlying loans.  And frankly the credit default swap market was a timebomb waiting to go off.  Plenty of the traders involved in selling the instruments on were completely aware of the trash they were selling, too.

Not to give the regulators a free pass on this, they fucked up, but they did not *perpetrate the fraud*, and most of the fraud was done in the US.  This, again, is a matter of record.  The UK housing market did not have a subprime crisis.

I don't know what you mean by ""other countries had less drama"".  Iceland nearly collapsed, Ireland has still barely recovered and the shockwaves are still reverberating around the Eurozone to an extent.  Fuck, one person working for [UNICEF](http://www.unicef.org/emerg/pakistan_49842.html) reckoned the crisis lead to a 30% increase in malnourised babies in Pakistan.

Anyway, the fact is it was a multi-causal systemic crisis.  It hit everyone hard.  There's plenty of blame to go around if you really wanted to assign it, from bankers, to economists who used deeply flaws models, to mortgage underwriters, regulators and commodity price spikes.

Trying to play some kind of partisan blaming game is both unhelpful and tedious.

Also you last line is incorrect, since labour somehow ran surpluses in the late 2000s, and as a percentage of GDP the debt and deficit were both well within historic norms at the time of the crisis.  Do please try to look at hard data before just making shit up.

The media has brainwashed you into having an irrational fear of crime. It's one of the most debilitating factors of modern day life. Yes, there's a chance some thug could attack that mans house for flying a rainbow flag, but that chance is very low and should have little or no influence on is decision to do so. 

No, I'm not 'irrational' or 'naive' for basing by opinions on facts and evidence rather than games of Chinese whispers and a hatred for this country. Ironically, ytou're the naive one with your head buried in the sand; *'Hurrrrr duur Northern Ireland baaaaaad'*

Not relevant (though it is fair to say that the UK did have an issue with mortgages being handed out to anyone) - the point is that the actions of several British banks led to their downfall

&gt; ""other countries had less drama""

Canada. e.g. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/15/AR2008101503321.html

&gt; There's plenty of blame to go around if you really wanted to assign it, from bankers, to economists who used deeply flaws models, to mortgage underwriters, regulators and commodity price spikes.

I am aware - but here we're talking about governments.

&gt; Also you last line is incorrect, since labour somehow ran surpluses in the late 2000s,

Due to following Conservative economic policy - when they decided to go their own way, things tanked. http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/main_issues/sections/facts/newsid_1146000/1146798.stm

&gt; and as a percentage of GDP the debt and deficit were both well within historic norms at the time of the crisis. 

Ding, here's the next Labour excuse. Because it's totally reasonable for a government to rack up huge deficits (and resulting debt) during a supposed ""boom"" rather than practicing restraint for when things started to go wrong. Well, that'd be if Labour actually assumed that something would go wrong, because it was Brown who tried to claim he'd abolished boom and bust

&gt;  Do please try to look at hard data before just making shit up.

&gt;That is why they are funded by mandatory taxation.

Like the license fee, then (more on that below). Like I said, loopholes don't really count.

&gt;The BBC is a nice to have.

Sure, the TV, radio and internet output is no different from any other service...except that it isn't.

&gt; It isn't necessary, it isn't vital

In your opinion. Most don't agree.

&gt;and it is easily possible to avoid using any of their services.

Via exploiting loopholes, unless you want to explain why *everyone* isn't doing that already. My wife is a nurse, and if I leave a barrel of water outside my house too, can I stop paying for the NHS and fire service?

Remember, we're not talking about what *you* could use as an alternative, we're talking about *everyone* - and we haven't covered the radio and internet services either yet. Do you have an alternative to Cbeebies, where every show has a page with no advertising, product tie-ins/ links and such that's purely designed to help kids? Even if you don't have any offspring, are you happy for children to grow up purely on the Disney or Cartoon Network channels and websites instead? I mean, they're all 'just services', right? What possible difference could it make? And that's before we consider the effect of adverts on children.

I've never seen a single anti-license post that addresses this kind of thing - it's almost like people only think it through far enough to justify their own goals or something.

&gt;This is why the BBC currently is funded by a licence fee that tries to only apply to those who may use its services

You're using the outdated way in which it was deployed (e.g. pre-internet) to suggest it's a pay-on-demand service. Fail.

Its ""sectarian"" now to talk about tax and spend? Please do write me the full list of items Sinn Fein wish to shut down from debate... it really is so difficult to keep up.

The debate on local tax rates is actually CRUCIAL to the survival possibilities of this emerging sector.

But as an SF supporter, I can imagine why you would wish to run away from it by simply labelling those who bring it up as 'sectarian'.

Also, I'm genuinely fascinated by the logic you are employing to label a remark on taxation 'sectarian'. Is it because it criticised SF policy in this area? Is it 'sectarian' to criticise Sinn Fein? Would that not be the ultimate recognition that SF are little more than an Ethno-nationalist grouping? Because it clearly isn't sectarian, according to SF, to criticise the economic policies of normal political parties like Fine Gael and the Conservative Party.

To quote Sascha Baron Cohen: ""Is it coz I is Sinn Fein?""

&gt; Not only do you misrepresent the shinners take on tax (they are for lowering it)

So the money to ""resist austerity"" and pay the highest benefits in the UK, really is to come from the magic money tree guarded by the green giant at the end of the glistening rainbow?

I was trying to give SF's economic policy a little more credit.

In planet reality, if you want to pish more money on current expenditure you have to raise it from somewhere else.

So SF want to spend more AND tax less? The sooner we can end up like Greece, be reduced to an IMF-dependent basket case and then vote even more for SF ""radicalism"". Is that the logic?

I'll take the opportunity to ask this question again, as I've got no answers the last times I've asked it...

... Is there a single qualified economist within Sinn Fein? 

Seems relatively important that there should be if Gerry, Marty and Mary Lou wish to provide so many grand lectures to the ROI, UK and EU about how to run economies (or maybe just calling Merkel and Enda Kenny 'sectarians' too would negate the need for qualified commentary).

You could contact the NHS to see if you could get a recording of the conversation. If they refuse, get in touch with the information commissioner to see if you can ask them to obtain it, since it is personal data and in general you are entitled to get a copy. The holder is allowed to charge you £10 for administration. There _may_ be get-out clauses (the police themselves have a huge one) but it's worth a go.

I would telephone the IC rather than write as they are likely to have a large caseload, and by the time they write back to you, the NHS may be able to claim they have deleted the recording. However if you can be as positive and friendly as you can, they may be willing to help. Search for ""NHS Direct Data Protection registrar"" or similar to get in touch with the right department.

Once you have this recording, you can approach the Police Complaints Commission. I wonder if talking to the Citizens' Advice Bureaux first though would be a good idea. It's free and you can talk to them in person, which is often easier. Bear in mind that getting compensation often takes a lot of time and energy, and unfortunately large organisations may choose to get in your way.

It's not a need, therefore it is optional. That most of the country chooses to have it, doesn't make it a necessity

&gt; Like the license fee, then (more on that below). Like I said, loopholes don't really count.

No. Because mandatory taxation is imposed on everyone regardless of their want or need of what it pays for. You can easily opt out of the licence fee.

&gt; Sure, the TV, radio and internet output is no different from any other service...except that it isn't.

Most of it is fairly similar to any other broadcaster. The BBC might have a few more niche services and a couple more documentaries, but the most popular stuff like Eastenders, The Voice, Strictly are all similar to their ITV counterparts. Commercial radio can easily do the ""let's play the same few songs"" like Radio 1 or 2, just with more ads.

&gt; In your opinion. Most don't agree.

Fortunately my view prevails in law. Long may that continue.

&gt; Via exploiting loopholes, unless you want to explain why everyone isn't doing that already. My wife is a nurse, and if I leave a barrel of water outside my house too, can I stop paying for the NHS and fire service?

Your argument makes no sense at all. It isn't a ""loophole"" to not pay the TV licence because you don't want to watch TV. That is exactly what the law allows, and the situation is explained in black and white on TV Licensing's own website. It is like how not having a driving licence because you don't drive is not a loophole. A loophole would be the iPlayer thing, where it is not illegal to watch it without a licence (except live TV), but the BBC would rather you didn't.

&gt; Remember, we're not talking about what you could use as an alternative, we're talking about everyone - and we haven't covered the radio and internet services either yet. Do you have an alternative to Cbeebies, where every show has a page with no advertising, product tie-ins/ links and such that's purely designed to help kids? Even if you don't have any offspring, are you happy for children to grow up purely on the Disney or Cartoon Network channels and websites instead? 

A very me, me, me argument - won't someone think of my children?!?!!

I think that the majority of people who pay for the BBC can easily pay for any childrens programming the BBC wishes to make. The point is that the opt out should be there for those who want that too.

&gt; I've never seen a single anti-license post that addresses this kind of thing - it's almost like people only think it through far enough to justify their own goals or something.

Both sides are guilty of that - both sides are thinking of themselves. Even the pro-BBCers are thinking about the stuff they watch, and since you've brought up Cbeebies twice, you presumably have or have had children who you let watch Cbeebies a lot. The pro-BBC 20 something with no anticipation of having kids might think differently. But every pro-BBCer seems to want everyone to pay regardless so you don't have to pay more. Let's remember, the BBC is not essential. The NHS is essential.

&gt; You're using the outdated way in which it was deployed (e.g. pre-internet) to suggest it's a pay-on-demand service. Fail.

Before the internet, people who didn't want to watch TV didn't need a licence. They could read books instead, they could pursue other things. This has nothing to do with the internet - with the exception of iPlayer (which, tenuously, you could suggest that someone in the 80s or early 90s recording programmes for you to watch on your unlicenced TV is similar). Believe it or not, but TV licence ownership wasn't 100% before the internet either

There has never been a point in history where you had to buy a TV licence without wanting to (i.e. you have a TV, you want to watch live TV, so you have to get a TV licence). If someone is ""failing"" here, I think it's you.

&gt; Your arguments are as weak as the ones people used to use when asserting that the internet was a luxury option for nerds. I mean, you can survive without it, right?

At one point it was a luxury. Today, it isn't - because so many things that used to be done in person/by phone or post are now done online. Prices have come down and quality has come up to match its status as a necessity. The BBC is not remotely comparable. There is very little that the BBC has ""replaced"" and isn't done by other companies.

What I think the media and the public and even the government refuse to accept is that IS isn't like Al Qaeda, or the IRA, it's more like Aum Shinrikyo on steroids, in short it's a cult. Now a lot of terror groups have a cult element, but IS is a cult first and a terror group last. Like a cult they target vulnerable people, brain wash them with an utopian vision, then separate them from people who can de-brainwash them and once they are there, brainwash them some more. Once we accept these aren't kids being radicalised in a backroom of a shop but being brought into a cult, then we can properly tackle this.

What's your point?  I never said we escaped unscathed.  Some countries had it better, other definitely had it worse.  You were trying to make out that we were some kind of special case, which was wrong.

Here's the [public sector debt as a % of gdp](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/public-sector-debt-ons-600x485.png).  In the period before the crisis, please identify the area of alleged massive overspend.  Here's [net borrowing as a percentage of GDP](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/net-borrowing-55-14-600x446.png).  Please identify the period of ""huge deficit"" before the crash.

&gt;  Because it's totally reasonable for a government to rack up huge deficits

Are you familiar with the sectoral balances equation?  I know that you're not, but I figured I should ask.  It looks like this:

(S – I) = (G – T) + (X – M)

From wiki:
""The sectoral balances equation says that total private savings (S) minus private investment (I) has to equal the public deficit (spending, G minus taxes, T) plus net exports (exports (X) minus imports (M)), where net exports represent the net savings of non-residents.""

During the entire time period at question, the UK was running a deeply entrenched foreign sector deficit (and still is).  Running a government surplus in such a time, as labour did and as Osborne is trying to do, is actually the more stupid move than running a deficit.  Since, *by definition*, it means that both the government and foreign sectors *must* be draining the private sector of wealth.  Indeed if we look at the [sectoral balances](http://www.3spoken.co.uk/2013/10/uk-sectoral-balances-and-private-debt.html) back in the late 90's we see that the private sector was net going massively into debt to try to make up for this, which is inherently destabilising since private sector balance sheets cannot take unlimited debt.  All this bullshit people spout about how horrible ""the deficit"" is completely ignores this incontrovertible bookkeeping fact.  Fact is that even in times of [expansion government deficits are completely fine](http://www.bondeconomics.com/2015/04/the-budget-constraint-does-not-mean.html), so long as they fall within an appropriate range and the economy grows than the interest rate.  Given that our debt to GDP did not balloon, we can infer that the labour deficit in the runup to the crisis was completely sustainable.

These guys are probably in a hurry to get out because they don't want to be sent straight back to where they came from.

Alternatively, they do not speak French but understand a few words of English and figure they will have an easier time integrating. For this reason you will find more Moroccans, Algerians, Tunisians, Congolese etc. on the continent than here.

The reason I wasn't selected was that they felt I wasn't quite personable enough, which seems like a cop-out. Since then, I've gotten a job in sales operations with an IT company which means that I work with a team of about 30 sellers, and based on my experience with Pareto, the vast majority of seller's I've worked with wouldn't have even gotten in the door at Pareto!

The sellers I work with are not door to door types. They are professionals who sell multi million $$, highly complex deals.

On the other hand, more than one of our sellers has at some point been in a Pareto building, or have received sales training from them and have gone on to be very successful sellers.

Based on all of this, I would say that it's worth giving it a shot. If it doesn't work out, then you should be able to get some feedback on how you did and what you could do to improve. As others have said, they are looking for a certain type of person.

I was afraid of that, as we've been in several different forms of contact with them over the past few years with this same issue and resolved very little. The latest 'success' we had was them eventually sending an engineer over to have a look at things. The guy from TalkTalk arrived and got to work doing a speed test using the Ookla site (which I'd also used and could have told him the results before he bothered) as well as a TalkTalk official looking page. He tried 3 different TalkTalk routers - ours that we currently use not being one of theirs, but one we had to buy due to replacements, we've never had an ISP's official router. 

Two of the three routers, which he freshly unboxed, apparently 'died' upon connecting to the house, while the third TalkTalk router displayed same speeds as the one we had used. The engineer concluded that it was a fault on the lines, and that he would pass the report on to BT to get it looked at. We haven't heard anything from BT for many many months now.

To add, in our recent call up to TalkTalk about 4 or 5 months back now, we enquired yet again on the progress of fault, and we were given yet another answer - as apparently stating that our router wasn't compatible with their 'systems' and they would send us one of their TalkTalk routers free of charge in the post, that we're still waiting for. Even then, if it did arrive, if they tested 3 of their TT official routers when the engineer was over here and none of them made any difference, what would be the point in sending over a 4th?

Our faith in TalkTalk is practically non existent at this stage. I can predict there will be a back and forth between them and BT when next time we call, with TT likely to say ""it's in BT's hands, talk to them about it"" and we contact BT only for them to say the reverse. So frustrating.

We haven't had much luck with BT in the past either. When one of the cables went down in the field, we were without a phone or internet connection for 3 months before they sent a team to fix it. Despite calling them every other day. They sent 4 reps over those 3 months to just look at it and go ""there's your problem"" and only after the 4th did a team finally show up to set up a temporary thin shoestring like line - which we had to use for two years before they came to put in a proper thick phone cable in place and pick up the old one that was still in the field.

I'm at this point in thinking they have different categories for priorities. Such as, if you live in a town/city, you'd be much higher on the list of 'get things done', but if you're out in the wilds and surrounded by fields like we are, you're very much bottom of the barrel.

Your position, as I understand it, is that I was quote ""Confusing UKIP with every other political party"" which would imply that UKIP were the only party NOT trying to lower immigration via whatever means they can to what they percieve to be an acceptable level and that it is in fact every OTHER party doing precisely that, which is clearly bullshit.

The fact of the matter is that all three ""main"" parties had a go at immigration and all of them either showed no interest in trying to reduce it or were unable to reduce it. Frankly I think I'd rather judge someone on their actions rather than on their words.

Not that it matters because you only challenged me on this because you were dumb enough to believe that I didn't know my recent political history. I don't even need to argue your point, three Prime Ministers and one Deputy Prime Minister has argued for me.

&gt;I agree their group of people to not let in is slightly larger, though I'd say it's also a lot less arbitrary. I don't see any doublethink in any of that.

This government loves economic illiteracy. You pay a premium for short term contracts because of the flexibility, risk on the part of the employee, lack of rights and availability. It is completely standard to pay more. His statement is fundamentally stupid, the real issue here is both that they're appointing temporary workers for permanent roles - probably because it works better for their accounts (it doesn't look like such a liability and comes under a different classification) *and* they're probably overpaying bureaucrats in general - you'll find this overpaid temporary workers quickly become overpaid permanent workers again, it doesn't stop them being overpaid.

I can't think of one instance where he was completely wrong, feel free to remind me with an actual quote if you have one, not quotes you made up yourself.

So far this ""transfer window"" he has said the following.

Regarding Lloris:
&gt;10/5-15 nice doom and gloom thread and afaik he's not going anywhere chaps, that we know of anyway ;)

Regarding Rabiot:
&gt;17/4-15 No chance now on Rabiot.

Regarding Schneiderlin:
&gt;17/4-15 not clear on that one yet

&gt;3/6-15 not completely but currently highly unlikely (asked if the intrest was over)

Regarding Trippier:
&gt;25/5-15 Trippier is true btw 
He Will be good to push Kyle and move Eric back to CB ;0)

&gt;14/6-15 Trippier is looking good as done now apparently so i believe but wait a few weeks for the press or club to confirm.

Regarding Ayew:
&gt;3/6-15 no chance we will sign him

Regarding Ings:
&gt;26/5-15 Ings is going elsewhere.....

&gt;27/5-15 Liverpool still red hot favourites

Regarding Austin:
&gt;27/5-15 Austin is not for us 

Regarding Rose:
&gt;6/6-15 Oh and Danny Rose not going anywhere !

Regarding Martial:
&gt;8/6-15 We are looking for strikers from OS [Overseas] ;0) or whatever I said.....

Regarding Ryan:
&gt;14/6-15 I have said it once and will repeat again, this is not happening.
shame though as really like him.

About potential strikers coming in:
&gt;27/5-15 Our potential incomings will be from OS (OS = overseas)

Our nearest neighbours get their phone/internet from the same line, but they don't seem to have any issues, reporting an apparent steady 1mb/s.

So there could be a fault on the lines from those poles, or, could it be a fault on our specific serving line going down to the village, while our neighbour's one remains unaffected?

Another fact to add about the TalkTalk engineer: I had asked what we were supposed to be getting as speeds, and he said 7mbs. I asked if he meant 7 megabytes a second, or 7 megabits. He said megabytes. But I am not sure if fibre optic around these parts can provide such high a speed?

Another theory I have regarding TalkTalk is that prior to them being our ISP we had a deal with Tiscali, which were then bought out I believe by TalkTalk, and that we may still be on the old Tiscali package from many years ago - and being charged the same amount for less of a service, effectively paying more for less by today's standards.

He knocks, I'll give him that, but on the last occasion before my wife could get downstairs he'd left a package on the doorstep and walked away. My wife shot the door open and with prior knowledge of him doing this she asked him how he thought that was acceptable...he apologised awkwardly, and walked off.

The kicker to all of this? We live on a main road, and the door to our flat goes straight onto the pavement. No garden. Not even a recess in the porchway to hide the package behind. This happened a few months back when we first complained, and the package was sitting on the doorstep all day when I returned home at 9pm after a 12 hour shift.

Back in February I'd ordered about £30s worth of playing cards online and the package went to the local delivery office. Which I had no idea about because he didn't bother to leave a ""sorry...."" card, after weeks of to-ing and fro-ing with the vendor he sent a new package, the next day the original package was returned to sender. 

Anyway, I put the complaints through for all of that stuff. But over the 8 years we've been here, we've had all sorts of shit with the postman.

Once I won a bunch of vouchers which I redeemed on HMV's online shop, something like £250 worth of movies, CDs, gaming peripherals etc. I came home at 9pm and like recently, they were on the very same doorstep. Pure luck no one nicked any of it.

I've also had verbals with postmen who knock and instantly post the ""sorry we missed you"" card - I'm literally running downstairs after hearing the knock, must be between 5 to 10 seconds, and the they've already posted it and left. I actually flagged down the guy in his van and had a moan at him and he laughed and drove off. Complaints, complaints, complaints.

I know they're stressed and busy and I always make concessions for that in my complaint letters and I try to be as polite as I possibly can bearing in mind that they are literally taking my property and fucking with it somehow by not doing their job. I have time and time again had issues and no matter what empty apologies they send me, it never improves.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;The review aims to improve public health protection while delivering a more risk-based, effective and proportionate system for official controls on meat.

Source - http://www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/monitoring/meat/reviewofmeatcontrols

Risk-based = Dead customers are cheaper than new equipment. ""We think we can get away without having to do X which is prescribed in the inspection lists because we use technology Y"". Effective = Doing only the bare necessities. ""Because we use technology Y and technique Z we no longer need to wash the meat before packaging which saves 0.0001p"", this will only be investigated and remedied post-hoc, eg, after people have become ill or died. Proportionate system = Doing fuck all where possible unless we *really* have to. No proactive inspections.

Basically it's a cost saving exercise for the meat industry and government. There is nothing stopping the UK from implementing our own standards on top, which we should do but there are costs attached. The issue resides with low-cost high-volume importers like Findus who source their meat depending on the cheapest local market but the UK are not servicing these companies anyway (typically it comes from Eastern European countries with looser enforcement environments). One argument could be that because a lot of the meat is going into readymeals it will be cooked appropriately before shipping. I am extremely skeptical that there is anything good to come of this besides pennypinching.

Benefits = Cheaper cheap meat. Doesn't really impact on British consumers as long as you're not eating bargain bin meat all the time.

Drawbacks = Increased risks of mass infections / deaths / spread of diseases like CJD and Salmonella.",null,0,null,1434363173,null,0,1434365031,0,cs720uu,null,t3_39vwbv,null,t1_cs720uu,null,t1_cs717ez,null,null,null,1437014378,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

I cannot stress how important this advice is.

Having a proven work history reduces that risk and also should reduce the time required to get you working productively in the role.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;Latest accounts show that Barts — which last year spent a record £80 million on agency doctors and nurses — started paying £46,800 a month for the services of Ian Miller, a temporary finance director, earlier this year.

&gt;Figures for the last financial year show payments of £78,000 plus VAT were due to be made to the firm Maxentius, of which Mr Miller is a director, for his services in February and March. The sums equate to an annual salary of £561,100. He remains in the position.

Temporary Finance Director for a trust which is haemorraging money. Maybe he was appointed to fix the problem? What's wrong with paying for a specialist? But wait... What's this buried at the end of the article?

&gt;A spokesman for Barts Health NHS Trust said: “The trust’s previous finance director left with immediate effect in February. This, coupled with the significant financial challenges the Trust was facing, meant it was imperative for the Trust Board to appoint a highly experienced finance expert to lead its financial recovery programme.

Oh so basically he was there to implement their financial restructuring. Fuck everything about the Torygraph. Bunch of misrepresenting fucking cunts.

&gt;By comparison, Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS, earns £190,000 a year.

£190,000 as the head of the fourth largest employer in the world is fucking derisory. The NHS employs more than 1.4 million people. There are companies 1/100th the size that pay more than ten times that for a similar position.

&gt;Mr Hunt writes that “although we have reduced the number of senior managers across the NHS by over 1,800” more than a fifth of directors are paid in excess of £142,500, the salary of David Cameron. “At a time of financial pressure, it is right to question the need to pay so many NHS staff more than the Prime Minister,” Mr Hunt wrote.

Again, the PM is in a political position and scores points by not giving himself pay rises. £142,500 is fucking shit for a director level member of staff looking after thousands of employees. Mr 'Cunt' Hunt can go fuck himself in a fire.

What there should be is an equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcome. Given the same opportunities and circumstances, if a working class student does better than an affluent one, then they'll be given the position over the affluent ones. Quite often, more than not, this is the case.

The issue is that from day one a working class student is automatically disadvantaged because they don't have as many resources available to them. Some of the main ones are; private schools, supplementary tuition, expensive music/sporting hobbies to improve university applicant status, ability to take unpaid internships etc. It just so happens that the affluent students are mainly the only ones who get presented these opportunities, then consequently get into the good universities, and then match the recruitment criteria of elite firms more often. 

There is a disproportionately low amount of working class students relative to the population in top unis and these firms. However, the ones that do pull through often do better than the more affluent ones. What we need to do is level the playing field *before* them getting into uni and a job.

* Moving away from screening via academic criteria and using past behaviour. Or using contextual admissions processes to adjust for disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds
* There is the issue of getting firms to talk about their outreach and school leavers routes with teenagers, with schools often very reluctant to do it. Often has to organised via the parents who work at the firm putting pressure on meaning the firms hold talks at schools in middle class areas. Furthermore teachers and parents tend to put low aspirations onto working class children resulting in them not considering university and/or financial services as a career. Needs to be a cultural change in elements of the educational sector
* Related to that people coming from some of the main Scottish universities (Edinburgh, Glasgow, Strathclyde and Heriot-Watt) get a lot of advantages in terms of helping them find a job and how to perform well in the application process.

However, I have never found it hard to discover the costs of my phone/electricity/water/gas bill and the limitations upon it, although anecdotal evidence is useless.

And I disagree, humans are always rational actors, but sometimes we can end up acting irrationally because of a distortion of the truth or because we're missing key information.

I think it is the responsibility of the consumer and the supplier to provide and obtain the information necessary. You are right in that we don't have the time, which is why we prioritise and don't bother for the cheaper products that we buy, which is why cheap products have a higher price elasticity of demand (i.e responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good or service to a change in its price) because it costs less and therefore matters less, per unit.

In the US housing market, there were undoubtedly nefarious practices underway, corresponding with a failure in regulation. This was a retail banking crisis.

It became a global crisis due to the involvement of investment banks, who bought into the prevailing knowledge at the time of being able to chop, package and diversify risk away. 

As in almost every trade undertaken, these investment banks looked for ways to hedge their exposure. They found it en masse via CDS contracts issued by AIG, the worlds biggest insurer. AIG was eventually bailed out due to a liquidity crisis to the initial tune of $85bln and rising. It is estimated that the bailout bought the company enough time to raise additional capital, and saved not only the entire company, but half a trillion of market exposure that was at risk via the domino effect.

The point in all this was that US regulation, for all its failings, prohibited or restricted some of the risky aspects being put together over the preceding decade, but AIG found regulatory loop holes in London big enough for only 3 executives to be needed to be based here to undertake the necessary sign offs to de facto, underwrite the investment banks exposure to the subprime market, and also their counter-parties in the subprime market.

I don't think that Labour were/are corrupt, rather naive/stupid. 

Further, I also don't see the value in reflecting on what a decimated opposition party believed. A majority government is the only ticket in town for decision making responsibility.

The problem for Brownites is that there is a parallel with Brown's belief in the ending of boom and bust, and the investment banking communities belief in being able to end default correlation. 

We could say that yes, everybody (including the Vicars dog) but Labour should accept the blame, or we could look at 1) the philosophy of the Chancellor himself at the time who had a deluded economic philosophy centred around perpetual growth... much as the banks at the time did. 2) what happened.

The Chancellor was relaxed about these practices as they validated his world view. Without the hedging potential, these CDO products and what not would have been tapered by the participants themselves, and while there would be a global fallout  - as always is the case with issues in the US housing market - it would likely have not been systemic as this crash was.

For far too long, Liverpool have had fuck-all strength in depth. So people aren't really used to the concept of players not starting all the time. This is an awesome thing - suddenly we're not reliant on Coutinho for creativity, we're not fucked if Henderson gets injured or a red card, we can change a game off the bench.

Plus we're in the Europa League next season, so it's not like players will be starved of game time.

Let's assume for a minute we buy Kovacic (unlikely) - I'll also assume Sterling leaves, as looks likely. Then here's what our midfield could look like.

In the 4-3-3:

- DM: Lucas, Can or Allen

- CMx2: Kovacic, Henderson, Milner, Coutinho, Allen, Can

- Wx2: Coutinho, Lallana, Milner, Markovic, Origi, Ibe

I've seen it happen lots of times before, drunk, aggressive people come into custody and they're strip searched to ensure they don't have anything they could use to harm themselves or dispose of evidence (ie drugs on their body).

It also doesn't state what the risk assessment was like or her behaviour in custody was like. Seeing as some people like to attempt to self harm but tying clothing around their neck to suffocate themselves and the police have a duty to protect people from harm, it could well be justified.

Whilst the MPS has payed out a sum towards her, they usually don't defend any challenges seeing as it's a lot cheaper to pay out a small sum then to defend it in court, which make it look the their judgement was wrong or the claimant was innocent. Taking 5 officers to strip search someone obviously shows there was a lot of restraint, usually it's just two copper of the same sex and quite a formal, standard procedure.

Companies expect you to come out of university and already have experience, as ludicrous a notion as that is. Truth of the matter is if you don't know someone high up in the type of job you wish to get into, getting your self a placement is an almost impossible task. I'm at uni currently, I applied for countless unpaid internships for this summer (when I can't really afford to be unpaid, which already excludes a lot more people in a worse financial situation that me). I got to interview stages for a few of them, did nothing wrong in the interviews. In all honesty I felt that my Birmingham accent held me back in the process. Even without putting a foot wrong, and actually providing a really decent case for offering me a placement I didn't receive any offers. On asking for guidance on how what I did wrong in the interview, and how I can do better in the future, I was told ""You gave a good account of yourself, and held up well in the interview, unfortunately we can't offer you a placement at this time"".

 Of all of my friends that I have met at University, the ones who come from a more privileged background and have parents in top jobs had no difficulty in finding an internship with ease. In fact, they are actually receiving payment for their internships. I asked them how they got one so easily, and honestly the top answer was: ""my dad's friend owns so and so a company, and he asked if I could get some experience over the summer"".

 Getting a job coming out of University is ALL about prior experience. Getting prior experience is ALL about who you know. Who you know is ALL about your background and where you've come from. This is creating a cycle of working class graduates who have no experience not being able to get their first job, which in turn means they cant get any experience, which means they can't get a job because of their lack of experience, ad infinitum. 

 It may be the case that your parent's connections can no longer just offer you a place when you leave University, but to say that these connections offer no advantages to students is not the case.",null,0,null,1434368138,null,0,false,0,cs737hh,null,t3_39wdfm,null,t1_cs737hh,null,t1_cs72jam,null,null,null,1437015317,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Taking breaks

Employers can say when employees take rest breaks during work time as long as:

* the break is taken in one go somewhere in the middle of the day (not at the beginning or end)
workers are allowed to spend it away from their desk or workstation (ie away from where they actually work)
* It doesn’t count as a rest break if an employer says an employee should go back to work before their break is finished.

Unless a worker’s employment contract says so, they don’t have the right to:

* take smoking breaks
* get paid for rest breaks

Exceptions and special circumstances
There are exemptions to the rights to rest breaks.

Some workers are entitled to compensatory rest breaks, eg shift workers.

Young people and lorry and coach drivers have different rights to rest breaks.",null,0,null,1434368392,null,0,false,0,cs739z0,null,t3_39v13g,null,t1_cs739z0,null,t3_39v13g,null,null,null,1437015376,null,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

Clyne is probably the best RB on the market that comes close to fitting FSG's policies of young (english) talent that has moderately high resale value. Beyond that, he's a fantastic player and it would mean that Can wouldn't be stuck as RB - which I think we can all agree is not his best position.

&gt;

&gt;__Waldorf__ (__Steiner__) __education__ is a [humanistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism) approach to [pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy) based on the [educational philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_philosophy) of the Austrian philosopher [Rudolf Steiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner), the founder of [anthroposophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy). The pedagogy emphasizes the role of imagination in learning, striving to integrate [holistically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism) the intellectual, practical, and artistic development of pupils.

&gt;Steiner's division of child development into three major stages is reflected in the schools' approach to [early childhood education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_education), which focuses on practical, [hands-on activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_education) and creative [play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity\)); to [elementary education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_education), which focuses on developing artistic expression and social capacities; and to [secondary education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education), which focuses on developing [critical reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking) and [empathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy) understanding. The overarching goal is to develop [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_(philosophy\)), [morally responsible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality), and integrated individuals equipped with a high degree of [social competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_competence). Individual teachers and schools have a great deal of autonomy in determining curriculum content, teaching methodology and governance. [Qualitative assessments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formative_assessments) of student work are integrated into the daily life of the classroom, with [quantitative testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summative_assessments) playing a minimal role in primary education and standardized testing usually limited to that required for college entry.

&gt;The first Waldorf school opened in 1919 in [Stuttgart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart), Germany. At present there are over a thousand independent Waldorf schools,  about 2,000 kindergartens  and 646 centers for [special education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education),  located in 60 countries, constituting one of the largest independent school movements internationally.  There are also a number of Waldorf-based [public schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_education),  [charter schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school), [academies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academies), and [homeschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling)  environments. In Europe, Waldorf pedagogy has become a well-recognized theory of education that has influenced public schooling and many European Waldorf schools receive state funding. Public funding of Waldorf schools in English-speaking countries is increasingly widespread but has encountered controversy.

It's not as simple as ""The school is shit"" or ""You the student was just a twat"". It's nearly always a mixture of both. Even though you do get twattish students in really good schools too.  

Obviously it's purely anecdotal. I once covered a Year 11 GCSE Biology class. I gave them the work set, talked them through it, and tried to engage them. That entire lesson, the Year 11 class were acting out, not doing any work, and basically fooling around. Why? Well, it was fast approaching their Biology exam, and they hadn't had a single Biology teacher since before Christmas! Just cover supervisors like me. Oh, and the work set? They had been given the exact same work 5 times prior to me turning up. Can't say I blame them for the way they were. Students can be arses but a poorly-run school definitely contributes towards that.

He very likely won't win. He probably shouldn't win (as much as anything else, he'll be over 70 in 2020). But what is important here is that enough MPs, finally and belatedly, took the left of the Labour Party seriously. That's a good thing for a broad church Labour that can't piss all over the left and say ""you'll vote for us anyway!!!"" when the SNP and Greens have been cleaning up disenchanted lefties (and other lefties have voted Lib Dem in the past, some went to TUSC, and many just sat at home and didn't vote). Labour will need to keep lots of disparate groups happy to win the next election and no single group can be taken for granted.

To get him on the ballot, get his views heard and considered by a wide electorate of people who vote democratically is really important. He is already changing minds - the campaign emails I got from Liz Kendall this weekend were raving about vicious Tory policies and social inequality, two things she was not stressing before it became clear that the grassroots would have been *livid* if MPs kept JC off the ballot.

Parts were cheap and insanely easy to find due to the basic shape being in production for 10 years (through the NG900 and the mk1 93) and the engine parts were shared with a Vectra diesel. In 3 years I got through:

* Clutch slave cylinder - £30 (a total bastard to fit though)
* A set of N/S doors - £45 including 'leccy window motors. Someone drove into the side of me on a roundabout, original doors were caved in, but still worked. Found these on a 900 in the local scrapyard.
* I did discover soon after purchase that it was leaking oil onto the serpentine belt, so that was fixed (loose plug on the back of the engine) and replaced the belt for good measure - £20

Eventually it ate it's turbo when pulling away from a roundabout 10 miles from home. Limped her back, looked at the price of reconditioned turbos and called the scrapyard to take her away. £150 received.

5x Tickets at £100 = £500 (I'll even do the ""math""  for you)

2x Hotel rooms, 1 with 3 1 with 2. = £416 (http://gyazo.com/f230bb6c039081a74e52cfe8e89da29e)

Even tho they had 1 UK players let's assume they had 5 EU players.
5x Flights = £75 each x 5 £375 (http://gyazo.com/81ce1d99a470c695442c97e82a7043cb) Some adjustment obviously needed on the leaving time.

So right now we've got 3k - £500 - £416 - £375.

We've got £1709 left of our prizepool. Now let's talk about food and drink.

Now, let's assume they eat &amp; drink like kings and say £150 for the weekend each.

£150 x 5 = 750 

We'll minus that from what's left of our prize pool.

So we've got £959 left. We'll then again split that 5 ways = £191 (roughly) each.

Granted that's still not a lot of money but it's a weekend away (arguably with friends) playing a game you enjoy.

BUT WAIT.... there's more

Let's factor in their win. On top of their prizepool they get free entry to the next event. So on top of the 3k Prizepool they essentially get and extra £500, or £500 off the next event they go to.

To get out on parole for a life sentence you need to make a statement of contrition or show remorse. If you really genuinely did not commit the crime then how can you be remorseful? The current system gives the erroneously convicted a choice between telling a lie or staying in prison forever. This prisoner had said the same thing at every parole hearing, that he could not show remorse for a crime he had not committed, that he wanted the real killer caught more than he wanted his own freedom, that he had not and would not tell a lie, and that he would like to be able to visit his wife's grave before he died.

Edit : I see an equally cowardly downvoter has appeared without bothering to comment. Here's the quote from Prof Collins, his wife :

*After Today was broadcast, and while Hunt was still flying back, Collins was called by University College London. She is a professor and a former dean there, while Hunt was an honorary researcher.*

*“I was told by a senior that Tim had to resign immediately or be sacked – though I was told it would be treated as a low-key affair. Tim duly emailed his resignation when he got home. The university promptly announced his resignation on its website and started tweeting that they had got rid of him. Essentially, they had hung both of us out to dry. They certainly did not treat it as a low-key affair. I got no warning about the announcement and no offer of help, even though I have worked there for nearly 20 years. It has done me lasting damage.

For one, this is the first time I logged on to reddit (ever), I looked around trying to see how stuff worked, looked for the info I needed before asking. Mostly, I saw stuff about people visiting and not moving permanently, so I decided to ask. I wrote it as politely as I could, chose topics I wanted to hear about but didn't need someone to speak generally about all of them, if someone had something particular to add to the best extent of their knowledge, great! And tt was actually people on the /r/needadvice that recommended I'd come here instead.

I didn't mind not getting responses right away (or at all for that matter), nor did I care I got a down vote a second after posting.
I waited and I'd be perfectly content with no one answering, assuming it wasn't exactly a new refreshing question. 

And sure, I responded sarcastically to a somewhat rude comment but he eventually even responded normally, explained how boresome this question gets, I understood and that was it. No hard feelings. And it doesn't mean I think all scottish people are the same but it's exactly easy to convey tone by comments is it? :)

But it's funny that you can immediately sense if I am nice or not. In all seriousness, if you get so defensive about someone saying scottish are arseholes, I imagine how many times you guys hear that about yourselves. Which begs the question: if there are so many people saying it, isn't it perhaps a but true? I wouldn't say ""all"", but maybe the ratio is higher. I actually didn't have this idea until I started asking around and it seemed like a common notion. And from my experience here, well... It's give or take.

My words of advice for anyone starting University in September will be this: Get involved with your SU. Be a part of some societies. Set one up yourself. Nominate yourself to be the Chair of a society. Edit the SU Newspaper. Anything.  

In my experience employers care about that stuff a lot more than a degree certificate on its own.  

Even since finishing my PGDE and I've been applying for teaching jobs for September, every interview I've had wants to know about my teaching experience and me as a person, not the grades on my certificate or the modules I studied. Even if they do, it takes up about 1% of the actual interview time.

To respond to your original point about proof that there is no space left in the UK to build upon - please direct your attention to Khan, J., Powell, T. and Harwood, A. 2013. ‘Land Use in the UK’, Office for National Statistics.

In it, it shows how 69.1% of the land in the UK is use for agricultural purposes. The remaining 30.9% is used for Urban &amp; Developed Land (11.8%), Non-farm grass, mountains, moors and heath (7.1%), non-farm woodland (9.2%), and the remaining land used for marine, coastal and freshwater space.

So yes, I suppose you're right in that there *is* land left in the UK to build houses on, as long as we are happy, as a nation, to be increasingly dependent on foreign food imports to actually feed the people living in those new houses (or that we build on top of our national nature reserves; whatever works).",null,0,null,1434372962,null,0,false,0,cs74pm7,null,t3_39f25x,null,t1_cs74pm7,null,t1_cs44fq3,null,null,null,1437016347,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

That is a hell of a lot of money spent on ""back-ups"" what is it like £50 mil? Are we such a ""rich club"" we can afford a bench that expensive?
Barcelona's bench for CL final cost €41.5 mill (about £30 mil) I know a lot of their players came through their ranks but that's still crazy.

The Juventus bench cost €31.5 mil (not including add ons, also only put Pereyra's loan fee not final price) thats about £22.8 mill stg!

It is stupidly easy to get a fake identity. The method is well known to government agencies but as has been discussed earlier in the thread they are choosing to do nothing about it.

1) Look up the name of a previous occupant of the bedsit you are staying in (192.com has basics for cheap)

2) Order a copy of their birth certificate. You need give no proof of your own identity before you order the birth certificate. My local council even accepts payment in cash at the council building, so there's no audit trail.

3) Contact a supplier for gas, electric etc and tell them you've just moved in. Supply birth cert when requested.

4) Wait a month

5) You now have a birth certificate and a utility bill. Say hello to a passport. When it arrives move out of the property and disappear with your new identity.

You're talking about a prolonged beating which clearly goes beyond the realms of necessary and reasonable. But a single forceful strike to the head or face may well be justified. You will have to justify it, so it is down to you to decide what is reasonable.

Given that we should only be resorting to use of force in the most dire of circumstances, I.e. You will be subject to serious harm or even death if you do not, then actually all bets are off and the threshold of force is very high.

If I perceive that I may be stabbed or.severely beaten, then it's quite reasonable to punch somone in the face as hard as I can and then run away or restrain them if escape is not an option. Continuing to beat an incapacitated person clearly isn't reasonable or necessary though, it's just revenge (and assault).

These are desperate measures for desperate times, not 'he was a bit mouthy so I lamped him'. If you are acting in defence of life and limb, them make it look like you mean it. You hit them as hard as you possibly can.

I have had extensive training in the legislation and justify use of force on a weekly basis pretty much. It's very, very rare that I need to do anything as extreme as hit someone, but if I genuinely need to I will have no hesitation in doing so.

I also investigate offences involving violence, including really serious violence. I've known fatal stabbings be ruled to be lawful self defence. It's all in the circumstances.

Look up Kenneth knoye.  He stabbed a police officer in his back garden, his defence was basically 'i I find somone in my back garden I assume they're there to kill me so I kill them first'.

It's also quite understandable, when considering things from the point of view of the refugees, why they take risks to escape to elsewhere. Who doesn't want a better life for themselves and their families?

The uncomfortable truth is that in the next few decades, we are likely to see even more refugees from the Middle East and North Africa. Many countries in the region already struggle to feed their people and give them adequate employment. Add on 2-4 degrees of warming, and the consequent droughts and conflict, and things will get much nastier.

Unfortunately, there is no good solution to this problem, althouugh in hindsight, many of the UKs policies in the region have clearly made it worse, and continual reliance on middle eastern oil simply adds more fuel to the flames.

\* Edit: 700,000 is the first figure i found from the UNHCR. However, when I look at other sources, i see that this figure refers to recent arrivals from Syria and Iraq. Jordan also hosts many refugees from other conflicts, mostly Palestinians. It's total refugee population is over 2 million.

From this [BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24583286):
&gt; _The Dublin Regulation is a core principle for handling asylum claims in the EU. It says responsibility for examining the claim lies primarily with the member state which played the greatest part in the applicant's entry or residence in the EU. Often that is the first EU country that the migrant reached - but not always, as in many cases migrants want to be reunited with family members, for example in the UK or the Netherlands._

Also, I think Syrians in Turkey probably still don't feel safe there either, so they want to get even further away. But in Italy and Greece, having 24 thousand and 16 thousand refugees in about a month is a lot to cope with. For comparison, the UK normally gets about 20,000 asylum applications a _year_. And the media complains about even that.

This is why there's talk of other European countries sharing the burden.


&gt; shouldn't they be looking to ultimately go back to their own country and live?

How many Jews, having escaped the Holocaust, ever went back to Germany, Poland or Russia; and would you expect that they should?

I'm sure that many of the Syrian refugees would love to return; but based on examples like Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq, the region won't be safe enough for another twenty or thirty years.

&gt; What is the future going to look like, often it's quoted that Muslim birthrates dwarf our own (5+ to our &lt;2)

Irisgate lol? Seriously? Not sure if you're aware, but the main issue in east Belfast in May was who can act as responsible leaders for the city bearing in mind the couple of years unrest alliance vision brought us.

Despite the keep out the DUP message, east Belfast voters rejected the protest vote in favour of a party capable of influence at Westminster. Indeed even you acknowledged that fact.

&gt;You *still* bitter about that flag? Wasn't Alliance who made it an issue, but if you want to believe what the DUP/UUP leaflets tell you over the truth, go ahead. It's not an issue any more. 

Since the general election, you've posted more about flags on here than anyone else. Telling. 

Also I'll quote your south Belfast candidate on the 'biggest issue' facing her in her constituency: yep you've guessed it, flags...

null,false,tmstms,null,null,null,"1) In my experience, people are very nice to individual immigrants and individual families in the UK. Anti-immigration is about fear of the mass, about pressure on resources in certain places (e.g. there is work for a lot of people somewhere and immigrants come to do those jobs, meaning suddenly there are lots more people for the same resources), and about the possible erosion of traditional culture.

2) Many people from other countries seek to get some initial support from other people of that nationality already in the country, should they want to settle / work. I guess when taken to its logical conclusions, whole communities of people then arise, who then appear potentially threatening to indigenous people. But for sure, there are lots of Turks here (not as many as in Germanic countries, I think), and they seem to be having a good life here.

3) Oh yes, it really depends where you live as well- but it can be good for you either way- in London, every nationality is numerous, so it has a different feel in the centre and in the central parts of each suburb. In places with few immigrants, people are actually really welcoming. It's only if there is a big community of immigrants that seems to be nibbling away at the indigenous community that anyone is worried. It also depends a lot on the job you do- much as with political opinions, the more educated and professional types are also more multi-culturally receptive, because they see themselves as having more in common with people in other countries, than more mono-cultural people do.",null,0,null,1434376130,null,0,1434378036,0,cs760hj,null,t3_39wneo,null,t1_cs760hj,null,t3_39wneo,null,null,null,1437017308,null,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

Oh yes, Alliance put that page up, just as they protested outside their own offices with flegs /s

I suppose you'll be saying that LAD are Alliance too?

&gt;Irisgate lol? Seriously? Not sure if you're aware, but the main issue in east Belfast in May was who can act as responsible leaders for the city bearing in mind the couple of years unrest alliance vision brought us

Any 'issue' in East Belfast was tossed aside in favour of the pact. You have some cheek to keep going on about 'Keep the DUP out' when the issue for the DUP was clearly 'Keep Naomi Long out'. As another post on this page says - ""East Belfast to an extent was ego stroking the DUP to ensure FST was on the table."". Thats all it came down to. Influence in Westminster wasn't going to happen. It wasn't like an abstensionist was being blocked out either.

It wasn't Alliance that sent out leaflets and brought thugs out onto the street during that incident. Who's offices were the ones being attacked? Who's Counsellors were left living under death threats? Who's baby nearly got glass in the face after their house got attacked by thugs?

Yes, because Alliance were really going to bring that on themselves. They took the responsible middle ground in a Sinn Fein and DUP spat, and DUP/UUP and their loyalist buddies throught it right to whip up fear and try to intimidate Alliance away from their position. I find your willingness to overlook the resort to violence of your unionist and loyalist buddies and victim blaming troubling, but it betrays a sinister element to your outlook and not mine, so I'll not lose sleep over it. 

Responsible leaders? You just need to look at Stormont to see how responsible the DUP and SF are. Yes, we're really going to have five years of peace when them in control. 

&gt;Since the general election, you've posted more about flags on here than anyone else. Telling.

I posted like, once, and it was about shitheads intimidating Alliance staff in their office again after the election.

Young people today are much more liberal than older generations. They are increasing turning away from religion and sectarianism so the catholic church and bigotry will not be an important factor in the future.

The main stumbling blocks are lack of parties supporting it and lack of young voters but these two issues can be overcome. As older, more conservative members of the parties begin to retire and die off they will be replaced by younger people who will be more open to support gay marriage. Eventually these younger party members will be the majority and that will shift the parties views. Once more parties start supporting gay marriage and making it an important issue more younger people will be encouraged to vote because they will have to chance to enact real change they will be able to see with their own eyes because they have gay friends etc. who will be able to benefit from their actions.

Of course there is always a chance something won't happen but I honestly can't imagine this being the case.

Not to mention the corrosive attitude of the media in general, with irritating or fire-stoking personalities continually gaining payouts for fuck all effort along with braindead talent shows and the repetitive, variating stream of singing competitions (hello X Factor...

In 2010 it was estimated that Tax evasion alone (quantifying the orders of magnitude higher some that is tax avoidance is both very difficult and unnecessary as it isn't illegal) is about [30 times greater than benefit fraud.](http://citywire.co.uk/money/tax-evasion-costs-treasury-15-times-more-than-benefit-fraud/a378274)

As of 2011/12 the respective figures were basically 2 billion estimated lost through benefit fraud - though this appears to include over-payment as a result of clerical error. 32 billion was lost through Tax evasion. [See the C4 factcheck over view.](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-qa-benefit-fraud-perspective/15796)

HMRC has subsequently claimed that [tax avoidance and non payment increased approximately 35 times between 2010 and 2013.](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/11/uk-tax-gap-rises-hmrc-avoidance-nonpayment)

One could go further and look at the impact of that revenue loss vs the over-payment. Evasion is disproportionately carried out by the economies richest percentiles. While benefit fraud is disproportionatley carried out by those in the poorest percentiles. The former have a relatively low marginal propensity to consume, the later and very high one. This means that the benefit overflow is very likely going to be immediately spent going back into the economy and acting as  a positive multiplier and reaped back in taxes. The much bigger tax evasion figure by contrast has a much lower MPC.

That's not what anyone is suggesting, nor is it how it worked.

The post study work visa is valid for 2.5 years, after which you're subject to the same tier 2 visa rules as everyone else.

The idea that someone who studied here should be allowed to stay and work and try at the chance to get sponsored or take up a role in a field that the government says we have a shortage of people for, does have anything to do with denying jobs to these mythical brits with years of experience and expertise. Why would a person with years of experience take a graduate job, which requires 0 experience and pays &lt;30K. 

Bachelors/Masters degrees are not being denied to Brits so that foreigners can have them instead, if a British person wants to get the same qualification, they can, and compete as part of the 'full pool of candidates'. 

The idea that foreigners are taking jobs that a British person could fill may hold water when talking about manual labor, but for a skilled grad or post-grad, it's just hogwash, and there's no evidence to support it.

EDIT: Just if anyone is interested here is a copy pasted article from the The Times (yes I know very bourgeoisie giving Murdoch money for things) regarding the issue of 'well travelled' applicants.


If I ever find myself in need of a job my first application is going to Sandie Okoro, lead lawyer at HSBC Asset Management. I’m a bit hazy on my preference shares and collateralised debt obligations, but at least I know Ms Okoro won’t be put off by something missing from my CV: I have never painted an orphanage in Phnom Penh.

Ms Okoro says she hears from an awful lot of applicants who have, and she is not impressed. It is a wonder that the doors and windows of third world orphanages can still close, with so many layers of paint added by middle-class Brits on their gap years. You would be more likely to get a job with her, she told an audience at the Girls’ Day School Trust this week, if you had taken a Saturday job in JD Sports than gone on an exotic working holiday. The only thing the latter tells employers, she says, is that you have a rich daddy.

I didn’t appreciate what she meant until I went online and found myself a few clicks away from booking a “Round the World Gap Year – the Whole Shebang” for £7,239. I could spend a few weeks conserving dolphins, then purchase more virtue points by helping to educate some kids in southeast Asia. “Want to teach on a paradise island, right by the beach?” the bumf went on. It is just a shame for the kids who live in nasty industrial towns rather than by golden beaches — they, presumably, are deprived of being taught English by a fop-haired public school boy.

Gap years have become part of the package tourist industry. Mention on your CV the week you spent counting turtles in Costa Rica and employers are supposed to think: what an amazing young person, to have gone somewhere so out of the way and done something so amazing — when all you have really done is booked a holiday in a Benidorm of voluntary work. You can book the turtle option on the STA (“Start The Adventure”) websitefrom £305 for the week (flights extra).
At least when I was 18 — 30 years ago — you had to get yourself down to W H Smith to buy a book inviting you to apply for a temporary post guarding racehorses in Normandy, a term in a kibbutz or a job as a chambermaid in a motel on the Chartres ring road.

The job which caught my eye was evening entertainer in a pub in Co Kerry. Not even my inability to meet the requirement to play the accordion put me off. I didn’t get the job, which is just as well. When I later visited the bar I found the entertainer leading a singalong of IRA anthems.

But even in the 1980s the gap year was becoming a cliché. When you went to do your good, or not-so-good, works abroad it wasn’t so much because you were interested in what you were doing as a brazen attempt to impress someone reading your CV. How many gap-year students have kept in touch with the children whose orphanages they painted?
How refreshing of someone in HSBC to admit that what really qualifies you for a job in banking is a shameless desire to make your own money from a young age, not spend daddy’s.

Others have shot down the Capaldo paper more thoroughly than I have (most notably [here](http://www.ecipe.org/app/uploads/2015/04/1-Occasional-Paper_v4.pdf)), but it's pretty thoroughly discredited - and the fact that the article you linked is so willing to either lie, or be so misinformed, is telling of the rest of their analysis.",null,0,null,1434379662,null,0,false,0,cs77qut,null,t3_39wcwn,null,t1_cs77qut,null,t1_cs77fm9,null,null,null,1437018806,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

My experience with Insurance brokers and investment types is that they fall into the latter category.

I've done business with some of the companies discussed in this study, and they struck me very much as people who just figure stuff out as it pops up, rather than relying on any training or particular skill.

Contrast with highly technical jobs, where if you don't already know how to do a thing, you either need to be sent on training to specifically learn how to do it, or you just plain fail at the job.

It's a lot easier to write a CV though, since it's clean cut whether or not you can get things done, and there's less shame in saying 'I can't do X'.",null,0,null,1434379678,null,0,false,0,cs77r5q,null,t3_39whkn,null,t1_cs77r5q,null,t1_cs75xoc,null,null,null,1437018812,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;Why is incest still criminalised here? We always hear how two people who love each other should be allowed to. 

One of the few universal taboos we have. Oddly enough, the German Ethics board recommended that it not be illegal between adult siblings a while ago. Think there was a high profile case? Where incest, and especially intergenerational incest takes place though, there is likely to be abuse involved. The familial context changes a lot of the dynamics.

&gt;If you want to discuss the possibility of birth defects, then you must also be opposed to people with hereditary conditions from having children. 

There's rarely a 100% certianty that the genetic defects will be expressed. It's a risk for the parents to take. And via IVF there are ways to screen embryos to remove those likely to grow into a child with the defect. Incest? Well, we know it's likely to produce problems. And in the cases of abuse, there wasn't a free choice made to take that risk.

Edit: Most of the time when people try bringing up arguments like this they're just trying to muddy the waters and confuse the issues to create doubt where none should really exist. But I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt here.

They come from a study produced in 2013 by the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) on behalf of the European Commission. What David Cameron failed to mention was that the figures refer to what is called the ""ambitious comprehensive"" scenario—in other words, pretty much the best case, which assumes that all tariffs are removed, and 25% of the costs associated with non-tariff barriers also disappear. Less ambitious agreements were projected to add £57 billion to the EU economy, and £41 billion to the US economy, while the least comprehensive ones would add only £19 billion and £8 billion respectively.

&gt;David Cameron also omitted to say that all of those figures referred to 2027, and were the difference between the projected economies at that date with TTIP, and without TTIP. They therefore represented the cumulative gain after 10 years of TTIP. In percentage terms, that's around a 0.5% GDP boost predicted by 2027 in the ambitious comprehensive scenario. Not everyone is impressed by that figure. In a blog post entitled ""Why Is It So Acceptable to Lie to Promote Trade Deals?,"" the economist Dean Baker wrote: ""Implying that a deal that raises GDP by 0.4 or 0.5 percent 13 years out [in 2027] means ""job-creating opportunities for workers on both continents"" is just dishonest. The increment to annual growth is on the order of 0.03 percentage points. Good luck finding that in the data.""

Let's be brutally honest, Drogba was pretty poor at times last season, but he was our third choice striker, so it didn't matter. That's certainly not what held us back in the CL, for sure. Falcao is potentially a massive upgrade on Didier, and without an enormous upfront cost. Yeah his wages are big (too big for his recent form) but the lack of a transfer fee make it a comparatively small outlay compared to Benteke, Austin or Griezmann. We are easily within FFP, so this gamble makes perfect sense- we potentially gain a superb player, if not he's off at the end of the season, no questions asked. Is Benteke a better bet?

null,false,murgch,null,null,null,"Edward Snowden, a former contractor at the CIA and the US National Security Agency, is lauded by radical campaigners as a whistleblower against the overmighty state. The truth is more prosaic. He is a thief, a fantasist and a hypocrite whose only notable achievement in life is to have endangered public servants braver, and serving a far nobler cause, than himself.
While working as a contractor, Mr Snowden downloaded 1.7 million secret documents. He absconded in 2013 and leaked to friendly journalists details of internet and telephone surveillance programmes carried out by US intelligence agencies.
Though insisting that no intelligence service of a foreign power could exploit this material, Mr Snowden had no grounds for giving such an assurance. The working assumption within the intelligence community is that Russia and China have access to the files and British agents have been taken out of operations in unfriendly countries as a result. Any country with that information could use counterintelligence techniques to try to uncover the actual local agents.
There is no evidence that any agents have come to harm but that is hardly cause for congratulating Mr Snowden. Lord West of Spithead, the former head of the navy, termed him a traitor yesterday, and it is hard to take issue with that designation.
Whereas Lord West’s description is temperate and accurate, Mr Snowden’s convictions about his own historical importance border on the messianic. “A child born today will grow up with absolutely no conception of privacy at all,” he declared in a Christmas message bizarrely broadcast by Channel 4 in 2013. His hyperbole is absurd but still more worrying is his incomprehension that democratic states have legitimate security concerns.
It is essential that democracies adhere to their own ideals of human rights and personal liberties, but these are not compromised by covert programmes to track the communication of criminals and hostile powers. For example, Talha Asmal, a teenager from Dewsbury, who is now thought to have become Britain’s youngest suicide bomber by taking part in an attack in Iraq on behalf of Islamic State. Asmal and his victims might be alive today if his communications with Islamist radicals had been intercepted before he fled Britain in April.
If the security needs of a democracy are to be second-guessed by private citizens who happen to have access to classified information in the course of their jobs, then who in turn will scrutinise them?
The answer in Mr Snowden’s case is nobody. Instead of putting his case before the courts, he fled to a state whose attitude to civil liberty can be gauged from its campaign to assassinate dissenters and independent journalists, and redraw the boundaries of Europe by aggression and military threats. Mr Snowden is in Moscow, under the protection of the Putin regime.
One slender benefit of Mr Snowden’s flight to tyranny is that it exposes the hollowness of the western campaign to defend him. Shami Chakra-barti, director of Liberty, offers the tortuous defence that Mr Snowden would not have needed to go to Russia if he had been pardoned by the US for revealing its “mass surveillance”. The notion that there is some equivalence between these two states’ security programmes, and that Mr Snowden is a victim of persecution, merely highlights Ms Chakrabarti’s frivolousness. Meanwhile, the West’s enemies have cause for satisfaction.

Now, though, 10m's nothing. Hence they're happy to hold out for a bigger offer.

null,false,mallardtheduck,null,East Midlands,null,"&gt; There is a huge difference between our approach to regulations and safety and that of the US's.

Maybe at a federal level, but most US states have far tougher public safety regulations. US businesses already operate in an environment where they have to meet varying levels of regulation depending on where they do business. Adding the EU to that list of places isn't a major burden.

The real problem is that currently, if a US lab does a test on a product, the exact same test has to be repeated in an EU lab; the US and EU don't recognise each other's certifications. This is a significant burden, especially for small businesses or low-volume products.

The major point of TTIP is to allow a single authority to certify that a product meets both EU and US legislation. Since US legislation _tends_ to be weaker (but isn't in all cases; see Kinder eggs and strength requirements for rail vehicles for a couple of off-hand examples), this would mean that something that's been certified in the EU would be automatically permitted to be sold in the US, which is a major ""win"" for EU companies (who stand to gain as much, if not more, than their US counterparts, despite the claims that it's all about the US).",null,1,null,1434381528,null,0,false,0,cs78rqo,null,t3_39wcwn,null,t1_cs78rqo,null,t1_cs76zvr,null,null,null,1437019651,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

He doesn't have any- literally zero- experience of playing in a top class league.

The justification for Falcao's wages are his performances in the past- he fucked shit up in Spain and France. He wasn't that great at United but neither were plenty of other very good players last season; it's perfectly possible that he'll regain some of his form with us.

You're living in fantasy land to be brutally honest if you think someone like Falcao, a genuinely world class player despite his poor last season would 'be happy he's even allowed to wear the shirt and be grateful he has been given a chance at the best team in England'.

2008\. Robin Hood Gardens—abandoned, graffitied, often called a ""British Pruitt-Igoe""—was on the chopping block, courtesy of Tower Hamlets Council. And then something really surprising happened: The architectural community rallied in its defense. Spearheaded by Building Design magazine, the campaign to save Robin Hood garnered signatures from Zaha Hadid, Richard Rogers, Robert Venturi, Richard Meier, Denise Scott Brown, Norman Foster, Toyo Ito and over 1,000 other architects. Hadid went so far as to call it ""the best piece of twentieth-century work in London."" If Tower Hamlets Council wanted to demolish Robin Hood Gardens, it wouldn't be that easy. 

So some pretentious fucking dim-witted architects rally to save a fuck ugly piece of trash blighting the centre of London, that no fucker lives in and is probably really fucking dangerous to be around - and someone listens to them?

That tells you something, for him playing at City was a massive step up to playing for New York and when he joined he was more than good enough to be a squad player for them. Nobody is saying we're buying Falcao to be a world class player and trust me he is not right now, he has never reached his Atletico form not even at Monaco. We are paying him, as you said yourself to be a 3rd striker that is better than Drogba. It's not hard to be better than Drogba so i dont see the need for our 3rd striker to be a superstar or even Austin/Benteke expensive. You can't compare Frank Lampard to Falcao, Frank proved he was a legend in the premier league all Falcao has proven in this league is that he wasnt good enough at United. I like the guy I think he's a nice person but we are absolutely in the position to tell him or Monaco or whoever it is ""you take the money we give you or look somewhere else"". The honour is all his, he will be joining a team that will challenge the CL next year and is favourites to win the league. If he comes I want him to do well but we will not be held to ransom by an out of demand player who is nowhere near worth 150k a week. If it was me and I was Falcao after how bad I have played (he literally cried about it) I would be happy and relieved that somebody is giving me a chance - let alone the best team in England with a very bright future ahead. I suppose I have an issue with the money behind it not him joining Chelsea. The prestige of playing for our club does not warrant wages that big for someone who has performed the way he has for 2 years now.

Stoke were formed in 1863 as Stoke Ramblers, making us the second oldest professional team in the world.

Our fanbase is pretty working class. Got a lot of Scandinavian, particularly Icelandic fans, due to our Icelandic owners buying a load of their compatriots in the late 90s/early 2000s. Our current chairman owns bet365, one of the biggest companies in Stoke, and one of the biggest employers. 

Our greatest ever player is Stanley Matthews, the only player to be knighted whilst still playing. He started his career in 1932 and retired in 1965. A real Stoke-on-Trent legend. For some reason, the statue of him is hidden in the far corner of the stadium. We've recently put up a statue of Gordon Banks, Englands World Cup winning keeper, also in a stupid location.

We're known as the Potters, as the area is the Potteries, due to the once booming Pottery industry, which has know sadly gone to pot itself.

Port Vale are our only real rivals, although we havent played in 14 years. Stoke is a city made up of 6 towns, so Vale take the majority of support from one end of the city. The smallest city to have two Football League clubs I believe.

I learned early on that accent doesn't necessarily mean intelligence or capability.  I'll never forget this one guy who I met soon after I graduated from engineering. The first time I met him he was wearing shorts with his shirt tucked in, socks and sandles,, he had messy hair, and a real nasal twangy broad Australian accent. I thought, ""Jesus Christ, who the fuck is this country hick they brought in to help?!""

Turned out he was the smartest guy in the room, he became one of my best friends, a mentor and a hero to me.

Okay, so you concede that everyone is a victim. I maintain my original position that the word becomes rather meaningless if you apply it to everyone. Labels are quite useless if they cannot discriminate between anything.

&gt;If you can't see that a 17 year old kid, who's bought into a poisonous idealogy off the back of some psychopathic cunt's twisted teachings as a victim, I think you need to reevaulate your life a bit.

Ah, here we go. So the person who taught him is a psychopathic cunt? I thought you said everyone deserves compassion? Wasn't the teacher most likely indoctrinated into this in just the same way as the 17 year old was? Probably at a similarly young age too. So why is he a psychopathic cunt and the 17 year old not? You can't have it both ways.  
To use your own tactics, I would say: clearly you have no compassion for this misled teacher who got swept up in a vicious ideology, you cold, cold human being.  
If you say, as you did above, that everyone is a victim then I don't think you can label someone as a psychopathic cunt and keep a straight face.  
As far as we know, they are both equally victims and to suggest that one is a psychopathic monster and one is a tragic victim is disingenuous at best. But that is EXACTLY what you have done. Don't try to wriggle out of this one, because you directly described one as a psychopath and one as a victim. Simple as that. Admit your hypocrisy.  
You keep trying to paint me as the one who is callous and unfair, but I'm the one who recognises that both people are equal. You're the one who singles one out and calls them names. 

&gt;I think you ascribing a value to this whole thing, as though there's a points based system by which adults who should've known better don't apply to beyond a certain age is childish and frankly insane. 

Sigh. That's exactly what I am arguing *against*. You're the one who labelled the presumably older 'teacher' as a psychopathic cunt above. Do you have genuine compassion, or are you just perched atop a moral high horse?

&gt;Whilst that may be true, that exposes you as quite a cold person. That's ok though, I don't really care. 

You concede that my statement is true, so you essentially admonish me for telling the truth here. You attack my perceived character rather than my ideas. 

&gt;I just think it provides an insight into the kind of mentality I'm pointlessly arguing with on Reddit. 

You're the one doing something that you apparently consider pointless. To borrow your own phrase, perhaps you should reevaluate your life a bit.  
It's a total cop out to dismiss the merit of the discussion halfway through. You're basically saying, ""this game is stupid, I don't want to play anymore"" like a petulant child who can't handle defeat. You complain that it is pointless and yet you continue to do it. There is no end to your hypocrisy.

&gt;I pointed out your holocaust denial thread because again I think it shows you up for the kind of person you are, a looney conspiracy nutjob

It's easy to sit there and write off my posts on the subject as looney without tackling a single issue raised within them. I think the fact that you decided you had to pick through my history in order to bolster your weak argument speaks volumes.

&gt;who's contributed a bunch of controversial stuff more in line with your average bigot than most.

Controversial? Oh, how terrible. And perhaps you can point out where I said something bigoted against a particular group of people. My posts have nothing to do with bigotry, they are about facts and a search for truth. If you see any specific errors in what I've said, then by all means, feel free to chime in, but I suggest you refrain from implying that I'm a bigot without providing any evidence whatsoever. Otherwise it's just childish name calling.

&gt;frankly you're adversarial enough to keep coming back and back and back with this sort of bullshit. 

Oh, and you're not at all adversarial, I suppose? You haven't kept coming back either? It should be blatantly obvious to anyone reading this discussion that we are both fairly equal on that front, so I wouldn't be so eager to cast stones if I were you. 

&gt;And the fact that I have to explain compassion to you and how it is indiscriminate (at least, to me, but realistically to a lot of people), says a lot. 

Yes, it says that you hold yourself in such high regard that you think you can explain humanity to another human being whilst denying that they have any of their own.

And finally:

&gt;In this situation the monster is born

Wow. Such compassion you have. You went on about the terrible people out there who view certain others as sub human. If labeling someone as a monster from birth is not dehumanising then I don't know what is. You can claim that you didn't mean it in 'that way' all you like, but that is the language you used, along with 'psychopathic cunt' and I think that shows us what you really think. You pay lip service and you exude self-righteousness, but really you are just like everybody else. You hate and love at your own whim. Your self described 'indiscriminate compassion' is a joke.

i am suggesting that if/when businesses look beyond the strictly academic they will be able to find more talent, and that he is an example of the kind of talent they have historically overlooked. 

Grant Thornton decided they should do this because they looked at their senior team and realised that many of their most successful employees would have failed to get in on that criteria alone. 

&gt; What exactly should the recruiters have been looking for in this person to make them realise he would excel?

well thats up to the recruiters isn't it - but its not beyond the wit of man. GT have suggested they focus on initiative, adaptability and ownership as values - how they pinpoint they I don't know.  

&gt; As I pointed out and you don't seem to have understood, there will have been many others totally indistinguishable from him that went nowhere in their careers.

well firstly I explicitly acknowledged that people in his position that have gone nowhere are likely to have done so because of their lack of talent - so yes there are people that superficially look similar that are not suitable for recruitment. 

secondly - what you *fail to understand* is that of course there are ways of assessing people beyond their university and grades.... are you being serious? Of course they are not indistinguishable!

Then you've forgotten. It's pretty normal:

&gt;In fact, the recently published results of a survey of students averaging 20 years of age demonstrated that about 20% of males and 50% of females report to have experienced at least one syncopal [ie fainting] episode. [[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1768435/)]

It would be odd given those statistics if no children fainted at your school. In fact it would be truly remarkable.

&gt;So, you're saying that it's a reasonable idea to increase the chances kids might faint or become ill? 

I wish I knew where you were getting this from.

In the exact message to which you are replying I wrote:

&gt;If a child is fainting then that might be a reason to stop that child from fasting. 

Two messages before that I wrote:

&gt;Dehydration to the point of collapse is clearly not advisable.

How many times would you like me to rephrase it?

&gt;why not ban a practice that has caused problems in the past?

Because fasting is an important spiritual practice for some people. If they are not negatively affected there is no reason to ban it.

With your logic we should ban rugby and soccer and running in the playground because all those things *can* cause injury if done irresponsibly.

In fact, [some schools have banned running](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/11521594/Schoolchildren-banned-from-running-in-playground.html). I am sure you would agree with me that this is lunacy.

- Under UN and ECHR obligations we have to look at any claim to asylum within our borders, we cannot deport them till we look at their claim. 
- anyone judged to be a genuine asylum seeker cannot be deported. Those who are not can but often it is difficult. Germany has 10s of thousands they cannot deport for instance, France too. If they have no papers or their home state won't accept them there is nothing you can do. In my opinion we should create camps for these people but the issue comes that they may be here for decades or more and this is not a long term solution. 
- a few solutions often suggested aren't possible. We cannot toe them back to Libya, thus would violate their sovereignty &amp; many international treaties in maritime law. Therefore we must look at all cases arriving via our borders. Unfortunately this means border countries examining all claims. Thus is not in their interests to do so due to Dublin II obligations if they process the claim other countries such as Britain can deport them there. This is why we either need some sharing scheme within the EU or we need somewhere else outside the EU we can send them. 

To sum up, border countries have to accept migrants under current laws. We accept far less than our fair share of these migrants. We processed some 25k claims in 2014 to Frances 78k and Germany's 100k.

To answer your edit: Your comments advocated more than just for people to 'speak clearly'. Your first comment actually implied that some native English speakers can't speak English 'correctly', whatever that means. The examples you gave suggested a problem with the most mild variation from your idealised correct pronunciation. A glottal stop isn't 'less' than a dental stop, it's just a different consonant. The same way an Australian will use an alveolar tap in the same positions.

Johnson was one of the best RBs in the league when we signed him. I completely agree. I was excited by him signing. But that is not saying much. For years I don't think we could have improved much on him. But frankly I view Johnson almost exactly the same as I view Jose Enrique. Decent enough link man along the lines, but there was NO end product for us. For us. Forget the blinders he scored for Chelsea or Portsmouth. For us he was wild shots, bad crosses, and the ball stolen as he tried to dribble through three players.

I'm not kidding around, there was no season where he was anything more than that. If we had low expectations at RB when he came in because of our years with the stable Finnan, that's one thing else entirely. But to pretend that Glen Johnson has ever been anything other than poor over a 38 game season would involve only remembering the five to ten odd games a year where he was pretty good. 


Honestly though my point had less to do with Mr. Johnson than it had to do with people batting an eye on spending on Clyne. If we view Johnson as even an average player over his time here, certainly we can agree Clyne is worth the price. That was my main point.

But yes the BBC is fantastic -  I do think they should stop chasing ratings and not try to pander to the audience, they should go back to trying to bring the audience up to a higher level rather than second guessing what the audience might like to beat commercial rivals (and justify their existence with ratings).

If you're not enjoying it, try to hang it at least as far as ""Dalek"" (episode 6).

You can also start with Series 5 (2010). There was a change in showrunners at that point, and also somewhat of a change in tone and focus. Personally, I strongly prefer Series 1-4, but some people prefer Series 5-onward, and some like both. If you start with one and it's not to your liking, definitely try the other. Both Series 1 and Series 5 make good starting points as far as coninuity is concerned.
