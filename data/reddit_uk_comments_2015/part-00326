null,null,Beanieboru,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"This is good for a number of reasons.

Firstly, a big chunk of the btl market is pretty dodgy distorting prices - especially on new build sites. 

Secondly, if a large proportion of the btl property is sold, then this provides liquidity to the market, the landlords need to sell as the longer they have the property the more money it will cost them meaning the prices are likely to drop.

A couple of interesting points - the UK isn't different from other European countries in terms of home ownership - very roughly 70% (+or- 10%) (although I haven't studied the figures for a few years). What is different is in the UK we are dominated by corporate housebuilders - who like to build 150plus houses in one go. Whereas abroad, it is much more common to self build. The benefit of this is money is spent on things like insulation and energy efficiency, whereas in the UK the housebuilder is trying to meet minimum standards and maximise its profit. Therefore you get cheaper better and more sustainable homes abroad.

Finally the UK resi rented sector is dominated by private landlords owning a relatively low number of units - ie 3 or 4. What I'd like to see are corporates/funds building a large number of purpose built (sound proofed, energy efficient) rented accommodation specifically for letting. A well managed and good quality property would give tenants security, ability to move relatively quickly, especially if there was a relatively large number of units across the country, and a sound investment to the investor with a decent yield. This has happened in the student market to some extent but this is a slightly specialist market.

 Van Gogh was though to be bipolar and  his experiences would have been a million times worse. Bipolar back then was pretty much a death sentence. I would probably have been stoned to death or locked away. The doctors speech is so much more poignant when you realize how horrible it would be to live in that time with a mental illness. People in the 19th century to some extent still believed that your sin caused your illness. Undoubtedly,  at some point in Vincents life, someone said to him "" You deserve to be sick because you've done something wrong"". Thats happened to me and it's been 124 years since his death.

At this point, Wanyama is worth so much more to Southampton to the ~15mil they would get for him, even if he ran out his contract and left on a free in two seasons time, he is the best player left of the defence that got them to their highest ever finish in the Premier League and he's their best hope of finishing anywhere near that position again.",null,0,null,1440307616,null,null,false,0,cuckbru,null,t3_3i0083,null,null,null,t1_cuc2vub,null,null,null,1441417267,null,3,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

  The Time Lords seem like a people rich in tradition, considering how ancient they are, so the hands over face means something- possibly shame, which makes sense considering Rassilons actions and the actions of the Time Lords as a whole. If she was related to the Doctor, it's likely she has some of his good traits, so it would be even more sickening. 
 HOWEVER. We see in series 8 the Doctor as a child before he became a Time Lord, and he obviously doesn't have a Time Lord mother. It is actually possible, then, that she is a daughter of his. He does have them, we know, he says so as the Tenth and the fact he has a grandchild suggests it. We know them he killed his own children when he destroyed Gallifrey. And also as they are Time Lords, if she's lived longer than it makes sense she looks older than him. So my conclusion is its his daughter.

The commentator obviously loved the plane. She was beautiful, and rarely seen displaying these days.

We all knew she was going to crash. As she came out of the loop, everybody was thinking (and many were saying), 'You're too low. Pull up. She's not going to make it.'

Then a fireball, black smoke and complete silence.

The Vulcan flew a flyby at 1,000 feet as a tribute. The entire crowd applauded. What else could we do? There were tears. Then we all waited to be allowed to go home. We got out at 8:30pm. Hundreds of cars were still queueing. There wasn't much aggro, considering.

Yes it is true. Banks can do this because they can create money. No other private entity in the economy can do this, only private banks. But banks aren't really interested in repossessing houses. They make most of their money via charging interest on the loans they have created.

This is why we have HelptoBuy and the privatisation of so many nationalised entities etc. The money supply has to keep on growing for interest on existing debts to be paid. If the money supply falls and deflation occurs it all crashes down.

Philippines here. Started playing football in 2008 to lose weight. Started playing as a goalkeeper but switches to field as the goalkeeping coach was a nightmare (forcing me to jog 20 laps with bad knees never ended well, and mostly resulted in puke.)

Started out as a striker as it was the position with least liability (according to my coach). He advised me to find a striker I could model myself after. During that time most strikers were pacy and full of tricks (Torres a prime example). So I had to look for someone.

Was watching TV and stumbled across the 2008 League Cup Final. Saw the way Robbie Keane played and admired how he wasn't the fastest, but could set himself up for a goal and had creativity in doing it. Followed him and Spurs after that.

Months later he leaves for Liverpool. But for some reason I still followed Spurs. This of course left me with a lot of ridicule from my friends and teammates as most of them supported Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal, Barcelona, R. Madrid and etc.

When Spurs where in the relegation zone, I felt anxious. I still supported Spurs. I didn't understand why, but I couldn't walk away from following the club. When Spurs placed 8th, I celebrated (to the confusion of said teammates), Spurs survived! Months after that I felt attached and started to say ""We won!"", not ""Spurs won!"".

When we got 4th, I was over the moon, I was jumping on my bed and broke it because of how joyful I was.

7 years later, I still am very much connected and still love the club. I stay up late just to watch games and when the club is down, I'm down (I cried when we lost the last League Cup final), and when the club is happy, I'm overjoyed.

Don't really know why I stuck with the club. But an answer I could probably give is... well... [love](http://38.media.tumblr.com/c158208dcf13a50f51682b7df860ba5a/tumblr_ngkizkhDX81svefdfo1_250.gif)

null,null,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; Frances O'Grady said an attack on trade unions was ""unfinished business"" for ""some elements within governments"".

Well of course. Unions have been directly attacking and hurting innocent civilians - tourists, workers, parents, children, and holiday makers alike.

We are a long, long way from fixing the grossly unfair powers unions unjustly possess.

&gt; Ms O'Grady said: ""I think most people feel that the police should be out there catching burglars.
&gt;
&gt; ""We shouldn't be wasting police time, and I suspect many police officers... would rather be out doing the job that they joined the police service to do, rather than checking Facebook pages and Twitter accounts.

I agree - policing Facebook pages is a waste of time. But theft is something unions do to ordinary people every year with their unjust and hurtful strikes. The police rightly should seek to enforce all action available to them against the unions to quell the criminal behaviour unions so often entertain.

&gt; ""I think there are elements in the government who see an attack on trade unions as unfinished business, but I don't think the country is with them and I think there are growing concerns about the civil liberties implications of trying to undermine fundamental rights, human rights, like the right to strike.""

Ms O'Grady is clearly off her rocker here. I fully support legislative action to curb the powers of unions. I, and millions of Londoners, have been routinely injured and affected by striking union workers. Not just by the tube - but tube action has done the union movement the most severe damage over the last decade or so.

Of more concern to me is the fact that governments have completely ignored the civil liberties of the people, the innocent people, dependent on a service - to whom the unions have shielded accountability. The unions say the people they deliberately hurt have only a contractual agreement with the companies the unions work for - making unions evasive and unaccountable to the people they directly take hostage in their wage negotiations.

Modern union action *is* terrorism. And terrorism is not a civil liberty that should continue to be afforded to anybody. That it is demonstrates corruption at work in British society.

&gt; Minister for Trade Unions, Nick Boles, said while the ability to strike is important, there should be a balance between the interests of union members and those who depend on their services.

The rules as they are currently look something like this:

* The employer must be registered to apply for visas, and only certain employers who can demonstrate a need for overseas workers are allowed to register.
* If the employer can register they must advertise the job throughout the entire EU and they must demonstrate that they couldn't find anyone suitable to do the job.
* If the employer meets both of the above conditions then they can apply for one of a very small number of visas that get snapped up very quickly on release.

Sorry to dampen your spirits, but it's almost impossible to get in from a non-EU country.

However, I note you mention that you have a chance of gaining citizenship of an EU nation - look into that further, because if you can that's your best chance.

&gt; {Ed002's Note - As a club you can lose respect and many mainland European sides, particularly at the highest level, have little respect for a couple of English clubs - including Liverpool. As for Lyon, they have always been difficult to deal with but have on a number of occasions exploited the fact that English clubs are wealthier than most and that has led to players being available for sale with one price for continental sides and another, higher price, for English sides. Aulas mocked Liverpool when asked by an English journalist about Lacazette - and it is true that if there were a bid now by an English side he has a higher price in mind. Up to now the discussions with an English team has met with the ""we do not sell our best players"" barrier. Liverpool should perhaps also have been a little embarrassed by the words of Piero Ausilio, Inter's Sporting Director, when told a Spanish journalist that Liverpool had made a ""funny little joke"" with their original €10M offer for Kovacic.

Okay, for the dummies. Networking consists of layers.

* layer 0 - physical wire
* layer 1 - electrical bits sent over the wire
* layer 2 - framing (Ethernet/ATM)
* layer 3 - network (IP)

Yes, you get a separate network at layer 2 (not layer 3) for public wifi. But your layer 1 is physically limited to whatever your physical connection rate is - which may be 70Mbps for fibre to the cabinet, or 150Mbps for cable. SuperHubs don't create new layer 1 magic - nor to do they go burying new layer 0 cables. So there's no additional physical bandwidth.

Now if your provider is artificially limiting your layer 2 (or layer 3) below that of layer 1 (physical) then, yes, you could piggyback public wifi without noticing (assuming both layer 2 streams had a total bandwidth lower than layer 1).

Chelsea fielded a weakened team and it was ours for the taking. We could have squared it around the back or played long ball football, ANYTHING would have done.

It isn't actually any different to the way people in private accommodation approach these things. For example, I live in an apartment complex and pay a service charge on my 1 bed apartment. If I live in 2 bed apartment, my service charge is higher.

Let's say I was living in a 2 bed because I was raising a kid. At the time that kid moves out, then I'd have no real reason to need the second bedroom. I'd then be left with the option of either downgrading to a one bed, or paying the service charge for the room even though I wasn't really using it fully.

I'm not Tory, but I sympathise with the idea behind the 'bedroom tax' even though I don't like the human consequences. The truth is that the state should not just be providing accommodation for life if it ends up being underused later on. Why should the state subsidise a 4 bedroom house for someone for the rest of their lives even when the purpose for it being granted ran out years before when the children moved out, and there's another large family who could use that space sitting on a waiting list?

Each hub can therefore be connected at up to 400Mbps. The capping of speed is done by the modem itself, at the rate defined by the config file it gets sent.

The hubs may have the capacity to lock on to an extra 8MHz channel and isolate it for the use of the public wifi. Or they could just take away one of the existing channels and allocate that to the public wifi. In either case there's still 50Mbps of bandwidth for the wifi, and still enough left to meet the needs of the current top tier, 152Mbps.

You seem to be of the opinion that a physical wire is strictly equal to one connection, and that's true for something like Ethernet. But not so for DOCSIS. To my (admittedly non-expert) understanding, the physical layer in DOCSIS is in fact an 8MHz channel, not the physical wire as this can carry hundreds of simultaneous channels.

For a radiologist, this means someone who is a local/regional expert in their subspeciality. Exactly the sort of person a foreign health service wants to poach at the peak of their experience, hence the high salary. At that age most people won't make the move due to family commitments. 

I see, so basically young doctors move to Australia hoping to make that much in 30 years? That seems a bit of a gamble, a lot can happen in 30 years. Also, considering the quality of GPs I've seen here in London, 80k seems more than a reasonable amount.

So, £8.4 at the current exchange rate?

That's certainly very good money for that kind of job, but he has to live in the middle of nowhere in Australia. For someone born and raised in Europe that could be a soul crushing experience.

All of this is just to say that moving to an extremely isolated country on the other side of the world, with really hot weather most of the year, just to make a bit more money seems crazy to me. And let's remember that Australia's got its own political problems too!

Causing death while driving drunk will get 14 years in prison, an unlisted fine, your license revoked and a 2 year ban on driving, after which you have to do an extended driving test again.

Ontop of this, your car insurance will increase significantly, if your job requires you to have a driving license (even if you rarely drive a work car) you will almost certainly lose your job, even if it's only a short ban as a penalty and people will generally just think you are a dickhead for driving drunk.

&gt;OK Chelsea. (There are only 4 other teams below us.)

You've got me there. The current champions that are owned by a billionaire probably have enough depth to lose two of their key players. 


&gt;If you took Bale and Modric out of our team that finished 4th, you would still have Van der Vaart, Adebayor, Lennon, Defoe and Pavlyuchenko.

We don't have that squad anymore, and that's not because of Poch. We're also not going to get a squad like that again until we're either in the new stadium and can afford to spend. 


&gt;Before Poch became manager, we beat Stoke 3-0 at home and beat Man U 2-1 away. Leicester are not playing out of their skin. They beat bottom of the table Sunderland, and West Ham who lost to Bournemouth.

Stoke under Pulis were a very different team, if your gonna make comparisons to teams two years ago you're going to struggle with this season. The quality of every squad has improved with all the money coming in, we're just unfortunately building a stadium right now and can't afford to be spending at the same rate as others. 

Also Man U have spent 200m since then and aren't managed by moyes. ",null,0,null,1440325729,null,null,false,0,cucp3l8,null,t3_3i01nm,null,null,null,t1_cucbav9,null,null,null,1441419582,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

So when you go to Just Eat it finds out what the last food hygiene rating was for all the places on that page. Turned out my local had a one star rating and I more or less stopped using it. A couple of days ago I checked that it was still showing a 4 star rating and emailed the council. Now the inspection was in January and it's only been open since about September and the council only does inspections about every two years. So there's no way it has ever had a 4* rating.

    However, if you require further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

null,null,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"In a true business, this is usually the case. Any legitimate cost of doing business can be deducted from revenue, before tax (*).

However, in the UK, this is not allowed for investments. If I buy shares as an investment, and I borrow money to ""leverage"" my investment, then I cannot claim the interest as a cost. 

BTL is sort of a half-way house. It's sort of like a business, but also an investment. It's been taxed sort of half-way as well. You don't pay National Insurance on profits made from BTL, only income tax. Whereas you do pay NI on profits made from a business venture.

There is an exception, and that is residential lettings incorporated in a limited company. In these cases, these are treated as a business, and pay NI and corporation tax. There is no change to the tax rules in this case. However, there are big changes to the finances in this case - as mortgages are much more difficult an expensive to get. To illustrate, I recently arranged for purchase of the freehold of a block of flats by the management company where I live. The freehold was valued at £400k, and the ltd management company needed a loan of £150k. We got one, at an interest rate of 7.5%. A personal mortgage in a similar circumstance could be obtained for about 3.5%.

In general, BTL in a ltd company generally doesn't allow the usual ""get rich quick"" BTL scheme, of remortgaging every couple of years to extract all the equity and use it as a deposit on the next purchase.

It is this constant equity withdrawal and high debt load that has led to concern in government about risks to financial stability, risks to tenants, etc. when these people go bust (and if house prices drop only a few percent, many of them will go bust, because they have no equity).

While the details of the tax change are strange, they do specifically target the high debt-load amateur BTL (i.e. get rich quickers). Low-debt load BTL are minimally affected, and no debt BTL are unaffected. Similarly, professional incorporated lettings companies are unaffected.

(*) There are exceptions - e.g. North Sea oil corporation tax is paid on revenue not profit, so that exploration costs, etc. are not allowable.

Starting businesses is the role that entrepreneurs fill in our society.

The local network (say, a few streets) served by each single street cabinet has a total available *bandwidth of physical copper* much less than the total of all advertised speeds for all connected customers. (pulling numbers out of the air here) 100 people served by one street cabinet might all pay for 30Mbps (so, 3000Mbps total) but the total physical copper wire capacity connecting them to the cabinet is only 200 for the whole area. At peak usage time (evenings, weekends), they effectively have 200/100 = 2Mbps each. 

In many areas this causes problems at peak usage times especially with many people (families) sharing one connection just doing everyday things: system updates, steam/console game downloads/updates, netflix, youtube and so on. Just one person watching a 720p youtube video is ~1.9Mbps, you can see why we have the absurd situation of many people paying for 30, 50 or higher Mbps internet connections and having to watch youtube at 360p when they get in from work. Now imagine extra people in the nearby area (largely in town/city centres) mooching bandwidth from your guest wifi (on the *same physical wires to the cabinet*) adding to the load.

Ultimately, people are busy at work/etc on weekday mornings/afternoons so the extra demand **will** be at peak use times. What they should do is prioritise the customer's traffic over guests' traffic if bandwidth limits become a problem.

This is all a bit stupid, the demand to use the wifi hotspots will be concentrated in town/city centres, very few people are going to stop on residential roads (most of which are deep in suburbs) just to use the wifi.",null,0,null,1440327237,null,null,false,0,cucpeur,null,t3_3i2b15,null,null,null,t1_cucoie8,null,null,null,1441419730,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

You're right on that, unless you have Chelsea/Atletico level discipline, sitting deep just won't work. Arsenal have too many creative players who can thrive with time on the ball, and it would only be a matter of time until they scored with us sitting deep. 

&gt; We need to park the bus in midfield 

Here's where I disagree: I think we need to take the game to them, much like we did in the 13/14 season. Arsenal don't like it when teams attack relentlessly: their players can't link up with no space, and pressing constantly would stop them creating their passing game. A midfield trio of Lucas, Milner and Can would provide enough energy to complete this task, I think. Obviously having Hendo would be preferable, but I think Milner will fill that hole as best as possible. 

&gt; They need to get kicked about, ran after, attacked. 

Yep 100% agree. Adding to this is the fact that Wenger, as a manager, isn't the most flexible or fast to respond -- if we hit them hard, his Plan B wouldn't come into effect for another 15-20 minutes. That's enough time for us to effectively kill the game off if we time it, and do it, right. 

&gt; we're fucked if he doesn't start

I don't agree because I feel Milner can fill the role -- that, to me, is why he was such a fantastic purchase this summer.

&gt;Yes, you get a separate network at layer 2 (not layer 3) for public wifi.

You actually get a separate broadcast domain segment. Either they'll make use of two wireless transceivers or somehow implement a time &amp; frequency division multiplexer on the single chip.

&gt;But your layer 1 is physically limited to whatever your physical connection rate is - which may be 70Mbps for fibre to the cabinet, or 150Mbps for cable.

As the other guy explained, the physical coaxial cable is a single broadcast medium for dozens and dozens of access channels; that's literally the whole point of CATV (as it was). What you're saying is that you can only receive one channel on terrestrial TV broadcasts because you only have one aerial.

&gt;SuperHubs don't create new layer 1 magic - nor to do they go burying new layer 0 cables. So there's no additional physical bandwidth.

They can demux multiple 8mhz channels simultaneously. Did you know that DVB-T is broadcast as multiplexes? If your tuner is locked onto one mux, you can technically demux every channel on said mux (which is what a lot of set-top boxes do). Same principle with DOCSIS, except instead of *air* its *copper*.

The Virgin Media cable can carry hundreds of 8MHz channels simultaneously.

It would not be impossible for Virgin Media to allocate certain frequencies for the sole use of wifi customers, thus avoiding any possibility of eating in to the local bandwidth.

Even so, this wasn't my point. My point was that a user on *your* hub won't eat into *your* bandwidth because the hubs already connect at 400Mbps.  A 50Mb channel could be taken away from your connection and allocated to wifi, or if the hardware allows, a ninth channel could be added for the sole use of wifi.

This won't affect *your* bandwidth unless your area is oversubscribed, which would be the exception rather than the rule.

Again, if that channel allocated to wifi was the same for all hubs, then the same 50Mbps bandwidth would be shared by all wifi users in the area. If that channel is different to one that's used by customers' own broadband connections, then there can't be much of an impact on the local area.

null,null,elmo298,null,null,null,"Ok well let's take this from a different angle, as I think you are just knocking me off thinking I believe everyone's gonna be out of a job. I've also seen those links before thanks.

You say I don't understand that the labour market will adapt? I have never once said, like some people, that these people will be permanently unemployed. Yes I am also completely in agreement with you that these jobs *should* be taken by automation, freeing people to perform better, less menial tasks. I'm not, nor have I anywhere stated that these people are never to be employed again, but that not everyone will find new employment and/or re-education. I never said the Oxford study said they would be permanently out of a job, but that they would be displaced from their current employment. I said these people can't jump straight into a new job, as there won't be the capacity to absorb them all straight away, I don't think that's contradictory. Automation will be coming from all angles, mental, physical and creative jobs. High-end and low-end.

Those people need a safety net that UBI can provide. Again, if you don't support UBI perhaps you'd support a negative income tax?

I also agree that labour governments are better at providing education which is also going to be needed. 

What's wrong with linking an article to huff-po? Where it comes from doesn't take away it's message. That's why I gave a mixture.

UBI giving goodies to the rich? The amount a UBI would provide is negligible to high earners, and as seen in that link moving the money to lower and middle income groups result in growth, which I agree working tax credits does do to a minor degree.

So I'm all for debate; what do you think needs to be done, and where do you think these jobs will move into? I am genuinely interested. I'd also advise you to look up jeremy rifkin, his views on job displacement by automation are quite sound, not that he really discusses UBI.

Edit: again, I'd argue a UBI encourages entrepeneurship due to the increased availability of consistent capital, and encourages co-operatives which can be used as a tool, like you want, to move people into different jobs. This allows them to own their employment, not be constrained to it. What would you suggest we should do instead to encourage this sort of behaviour?

&gt;""that's not ransom, that is reality"", as-if international market forces are natural forces

You have a completely warped definition of what 'reality' is. Something can be 'artificial' (as in constructed or derived by human action) and also be reality.

&gt;Everything down to property laws are human constraints. That is, they exist only when there is something forcing and allowing them exist. 

What are you even talking about... Are you trying to explain basic causality to me? I never questioned the fundamentals of causality.

&gt;It's true that you can see market forces in every organism but that doesn't make it a natural law either

Then what in god's name is a 'natural law'?...

Hate to digress for a second, but you have an awfully religious view of organisms. The distinction between the largest macromolecule and the smallest living organism is so difficult to form that many biologists come to terms with that the fact that our definition of 'living' is probably never going to be adequate. The 'natural laws' governing dictate what biochemistry occurs in organisms and subsequently these laws carry all the way up (obviously they appear differently to us) to group behaviour. You can view why an animal runs from a predator from a biochemical perspective or from a behavioural biology perspective.

&gt;My meaning is there is no natural situation...since it all depends on the systems you create.

Yes. That I will agree with. But that's not what you were arguing against before.

You were denying that market forces are natural in the reality that we have presently. (I will note however that the guy never used the term 'natural'; you did.) This denial is simply ludicrous. No one is denying that you can have different forms of society. But within every society there are *individuals* with goals that they wish to achieve. They cannot achieve all of these goals and cannot achieve all of the ones they can by themselves; all due to time constraints. This is the most simplified, most axiomatic starting point for 'market forces'. And evidently no one on earth denies this but you.

Not if you have a change of circumstances. Ring SFE, excplain the situation, they'll point you in the direction of a ""change of circumstances"" form. Fill it out with your parents' predicted earnings for the CURRENT year, and they'll process your application accordingly. If your parents earn more than predicted over the course of the year, the additional grant based on the projection you gave them gets added to your loan balance to pay at the end of your course. If they earn less, you'll get more the following year.

Just make sure that your parents keep hold of all P45s and P60s as you have to send these off to SFE once they come in to prove earnings.

Because being a muslim is basing your life on religious directives, and has a direct consequence on how you deal with others - in other news, to give religion the same leeway is to legitimise it, suggesting you're more worried about being PC than reading up on what you're defending. Yes the creator of the notice is a bit of an arse, but so is religion generally - which would you prefer, an arse or a *religious* arse? Someone has put up a sign - is that as bad as patrolling the streets enforcing *your* religion? Which of those would *really* promote the most 'fury'? Get some perspective.

&gt;That is bigotry pure and simple, and is logically indefensible.

Like religion, then - 'pure and simple'. *Now* do you see? Or is it better to downvote for fear of causing offense? Would you trust your doctor to treat you based on a 900 year old medical text book, for example?

There is nothing wrong with being seen as a centre party, so long as it isn't used as an actual means of trying to attract voters, because that failed miserably in this year's election. The whole ""the left-wing suck and the right-wing suck so go for the guys in the middle"" philosophy just won't cut it, I'm afraid. Election campaigns, in my opinion anyway, just need instead to focus on liberal values in order to be successful. I mean, if you actually polled people, I would wager that the vast majority of people support the core Liberal Democrat values more than those of any other British party. Take the Snooper's Charter, for example. Regardless of whether you're rich or poor, left or right on the political spectrum, I'd imagine that most people under forty would oppose that and have supported Clegg's calls for an ""Internet Bill of Rights"" if they actually just knew about it. When I explained to older relatives about what a Snooper's Charter would allow, even they (as staunch right-wing UKIP supporters) said that it sounded awful.

2. The Green surge will grind to a halt

If the ""Green Surge"" fails, then surely that will only be good for the Liberal Democrats. Unless I am mistaken after all, the Liberal Democrats are probably the party with the most devotion to environmentalism after the Greens. Whilst the Greens remain a one-policy party going forward, which might reinstate their image as ""loonies"" like Green Peace and the like, the Liberal Democrats could attract moderate voters who care about the environment but simultaneously want a more credible party at the helm with other policies they can get behind.

3. Social media will be hell

I'm probably more left-wing than most Liberal Democrat supporters, although ultimately I back the party over the traditional left like a Corbyn-led Labour because they're all far too authoritarian for my tastes, but I really hate how everywhere is assuming that Corbyn as leader will automatically result in defeat for Labour come 2020. For starters, it is important to recognise that the election will be held in 2020 - not today - and that by then the country's political compass may have changed. After five years of ideologically-motivated Tory cuts, perhaps the public will crave a strong left-wing candidate to reinstate true public services. Furthermore, although this is probably an overly ambitious view, let's also consider that strong political figures often change a country's political system. Ever since Thatcher, the UK has been drifting farther right. Maybe Corbyn could be the one to drag us back to the left? We don't yet know how he'll perform as a party leader, after all.

4. Labour will be in a constant state of crisis

Labour has been a very broad-church now, as even the leadership candidates themselves put it, for a rather long while. There is definitely an existential crisis within the party, which ultimately needs to be decided, because what does a Labour party mean in the 21st century? The party rose during the early 20th century, back when in a post-Industrial Revolution world workers were horribly treated. That isn't quite such an issue nowadays, or at least not to such an extreme that we perhaps need a dedicated party for the workers, and modern Britain is also becoming increasingly less focused upon manual labour. I'd wager that the majority of British people now work in offices or the like, where a strong Labour movement really isn't needed at all. Part of me does think that Labour are irrelevant in a modern Britain, so I certainly don't see their potential collapse as harmful to British politics like others do. It'll either lead to the Liberal Democrats returning to their opposition stance, as the Liberal Party once was many years ago, or the faux-autocracy under the FPTP system will lead the public to finally get behind a PR system on a wide-scale. I think either of those would be good for the party and the country.

5. It will be harder for the Liberal Democrats to make a comeback

This could be tackled in a number of ways, such as completely ruling out a Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition if Corbyn proves to be that disastrous a leader. That said, this again falls back to my point that the election is in 2020 and not today. Unless I'm mistaken, the Conservatives will have a new leader by then too. Cameron is a moderate within the party, but if someone like Theresa May takes the helm? She's downright Orwellian in her views and, coupled with a socialist on the left, I think that the Liberal Democrats could prosper greatly from being a real moderate party: one which isn't economically illiterate but doesn't simultaneously condemn the poor.",null,0,null,1440329853,null,null,false,0,cucpziq,null,t3_3hwpah,null,null,null,t3_3hwpah,null,null,null,1441420000,null,6,null,LibDem,t5_2qwov,6,null

Nah the fundamental problem is that it wasn't investing money at all. It was borrowing and leverage. The individuals themselves didn't do the Von Mises deal that is to defer consumption for bigger rewards. They simply borrowed more and more.

&gt;Even the most basic of education should've taught them high returns are what you get from high risk. 

The problem is from 1999-2014 (with a slight pause in 2008 when they were bailed out as Fegus Wilson was stuffed in 2008 and he knew it but got bailed out). It was a ONE way bet. In 2008 they got an indirect bailout continuing the one way bet streak. 

&gt;They made a fundamental mistake in their accounting - any change to regulation or the housing market and they'd collapse, a supposition anyone with a brain cell would have realised is incredibly likely. We're also talking about a bunch of investors that had no exit strategy. So what does this teach us? Idiots who didn't know what they were doing get fleeced.

A natural law would be gravity, magnetism, and such. But I feel this whole discussion is being had on a misunderstanding. The original comment was:

And that is the statement I criticised with saying it is all artificial. If I were to complain that earth holds us to ransom with gravity, then the reply that it is merely reality is correct. If the complaint is that companies are behaving in ways unfavourable to countries, then I do not feel you can appeal to 'reality'. That is to say; one can say it is reality in the way one can say anything is reality. So I can only assume the original 'that's reality' is in order to pose as 'normal' or 'natural' the current situation, as opposed to making the general statement that ""the situation which exists is reality"".

I think you read a lot of things into what I said which I never said, beyond that.

Only because you're asserting religion is legitimate.

&gt;If religion is bad, but non-religious people do the same bad things as religious people do (e.g . write mean words), then both the religious arseholes and the non-religious arseholes are as bad as each other.

Yes they are - but one of them isn't using religion to justify it.

&gt;The issue is not one of the individual justifications for the actions, rather it is the actions themselves that cause contention. If a Muslim or an athiest were to punch me in the face, I wouldn't care about their belief system as it is irrelevant.

You're removing context in order to level the playing field - there is no 'action' involved, but if someone put up a 'we don't want racists or homophobes here', would you have the same problem? And if not, why not?

&gt;All that matters is that they punched me and both would be deserving of the same punishment for committing the same crime. I wouldn't think ""oh, you're an athiest, sorry for putting my face in front of your fist"". Religion has nothing to do with it.

And punching someone in the face because they ran you over while drunk isn't equal to doing the same because you don't like their haircut - in other words, you're removing context again when it's key to the motivations involved.

In a raw and arguably necessary display of capitalism, she sells them for far more than the government’s legally required “fair prices”. It is ironically because of those government-imposed fair prices that the goods often aren’t available at supermarkets at fair prices as it’s simply not profitable to import them. This is thanks to economic policies dating back more than a decade.

Housing benefit is calculated on the number of rooms required and I have no issue with that.

However, here's an illustration as to the stupidity of it.

Take a couple with one child living in Sheffield. Neither of them work. The LHA rate (what housing benefit is now called) is £107.11 for two bedrooms.

They could quite easily rent a 3 bed property in an area of Sheffield, currently listed on Right Move for £104 per week. They would not get penalised for having a spare room.

Take that same couple and child and put them in a 3 bed council house.They would be allowed a maximum of £107.11 for 2 rooms. However, with the spare room, they end up losing 14% of their LHA as they have a spare room. 

I object to it being called the bedroom tax because it's not a tax.

&gt;1) stop straw manning

Quotes, please - or I'll insist you're deploying some other logical fallacy (and choose one at random)  - then wait while *you* waste time demonstrating that it isn't.

2) stop editing your comment after I've posted a reply

Was actually editing before your reply appeared - are all your guesses this bad?

3) don't complain about down voting when your comment is largely tangential to the current discussion

In your opinion, which is really worth nothing without adding some kind of justification - is context really that troublesome?

4) don't bother replying if you're not going to contribute properly. 

Likewise. You haven't done much other than remove context in order to maintain the supposed offense.

&gt;The discussion isn't about legitimising religious motives.

Until someone points out that it's a big factor.

&gt; Now either stop trolling

Stop butthurt-waffling and present a reasonable response instead of avoiding the issue. If you don't think my replies are valid, *don't answer* - you're certainly winning in the troll stakes with obvious tricks like pretending that adding context to address repeated (and frankly stereotyped) assumptions amount to a strawman.

&gt;or improve your reading comprehension.

Give a reasonable reply to comprehend - otherwise you're doing little more than suggesting religion is beyond reproach, which is actually ignoring both sides of the argument.

The last part was imperative to my argument and it's unfair to leave that out in your reply.

To summarise my point we are not a better team than those in the top 4 and we have a long road of stability and progress ahead of us. Playing musical chairs with managers is a method that has proven to be an instant failure. It hasn't worked in the past for us and it's silly to endorse this method looking forward.

None of the top 4 came good overnight. It's renowned that Fergie and Wenger both had pretty shakey starts to their tenures, but commitment to their long term plans has paid dividends in the end.

Man City are now starting to reap the rewards of stability. They've allowed a manager to come in and improve on his own inadequacies over a longer period of time than one season.

Hamas &amp; the others I've mentioned were not accused of anti-semitism because they criticised Israel.

They were accused of anti-semitism because all organisations advance anti-semitic positions (i.e. Jews make bread out of the blood of muslim/christian children, Jews run the world banks, Jews are secretly plotting blah blah blah).

The problem is that in previous decades, it's taken two generations for the incoming religion to all but disappear (count the number of synagogues 50 years ago and compare to now) making complaints a bit daft - but these days, with populations growing as they are, *we don't have the time* - and pandering to religious sensibilities from 900 years ago (or longer) isn't going to address that.

null,null,whitepalms85,null,null,null,"&gt; ""common sense"" is code for this is what I believe

No, it's not. Even with basic understanding of economics and socialism it's fairly obvious that they contradict each other. To make it even more obvious, pretty much all former socialist countries are poor and their economies totally failed. 

&gt; If you read the article you'll see they disagree that Corbyn is far-left

Seriously? The Guardian is a left wing newspaper, so their certainly aren't neutral and those economists are just a selected group. E.g. if you ask a group of right wing economists then they will tell you the exact opposite. Also it's true that a lot of economists question ""austerity"" but austerity isn't really an economic term. E.g. most economists think that reforms are good but might question making certain cuts during a crisis. It's not black/white. People that think that you can be for or against austerity are just stupid. It's much more complicated. And the IMF certainly wouldn't support Corbyn. They, correctly, criticized some of the austerity measures but that doesn't mean that they are in favor of all far left wing policies now.

&gt; Except there are socialist economists

Yes, but they aren't recognized by main stream economics. Just because you are an economist doesn't mean you are banned from having certain opinions.

&gt; Marx was an economist

Yes, and not a bad one but that was 150 years ago when there wasn't even data about the economy available. He wasn't all wrong but some of his fundamental assumption have been proven wrong. 

&gt; socialists countries still have/had economies and theories on how to run them

Yes, but they terribly failed. Most former socialist countries are now poor and/or dictatorships. 

&gt; Just because you are unaware of their theories, doesn't mean they don't exist.

null,null,TheColinous,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt; GUIDELINES on how to deal with suicidal benefits claimants have been handed out by the Department for Work and Pensions to Scots workers tasked with rolling out the UK Government’s controversial welfare reforms.

&gt; As part of a six-point plan for dealing with suicidal claimants who have been denied welfare payments, call-centre staff in Glasgow have been told to wave the guidance, printed on a laminated pink card, above their head.

&gt; The guidance is meant to help staff dealing with unsuccessful applicants for Universal Credit who are threatening to self-harm or take their own life.

&gt; A manager is then meant to rush over to listen in to the call and workers – who insist they have had no formal training in the procedure – must “make some assessment on the degree of risk” by asking a series of questions.

&gt; One section of the six-point plan, titled “gather information”, demands that staff allow claimants to talk about their intention to commit suicide.

&gt; The call-centre workers, who earn between £15,000 and £17,000 a year, must “find out specifically what is planned, when it is planned for, and whether the customer has the means-to-hand”, according to the guidance seen by the Sunday Herald.

&gt; Staff are also warned in the plan that they may have “thoughts and feelings” about the situation afterwards and offered reassurance that “this is all part of the process of coping with the experience and is normal”.

&gt; Glasgow-based call-centre workers have accused the DWP of asking them to carry out the job of a psychologist or social worker.

&gt; The SNP have accused the UK Government of “playing a dangerous game with people’s lives”.

&gt; Universal Credit combines six working-age benefits – including housing benefit, Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) and tax credits – into a single payment. Although not yet fully rolled out across the UK, Universal Credit is already available to benefit claimants in more than 40 so-called “Jobcentre areas” in Scotland, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling, Inverness and Dumfries as well as parts of Lanarkshire, Aberdeenshire and Ayrshire.

&gt; Processors and telephonists have to contact claimants to tell them they have been denied the new benefit or are facing sanctions which can mean payments are withheld for up to three years.

&gt; One Scottish call handler, who asked not to be named, said: “Some of us have been given a baby-pink laminated sheet which we’ve been told to hold up in the air if someone threatens to self-harm or commit suicide. So, when we are on the phone speaking to claimants – who are often very vulnerable people who are being sanctioned all the time and have no money – if they express that they intend to harm themselves or kill themselves there is a sheet instructing us how to react, which involves asking a number of questions, including how they intend to do it.

&gt; “This would suggest the DWP is expecting it to happen and I assume that this procedure is in place so that they can say they did their part. But we are not trained to deal with vulnerable people in this way. It’s a very distressing thing for us to handle.

&gt; “They’re basically telling us to assess claimants by asking how they intend to self-harm or commit suicide, which is a job that only a trained psychologist, social worker, or at the very least, a counsellor should be doing.”

&gt; Another worker said: “There was a man on the phone to me who said if he didn’t get money he’d kill himself. This was before we were issued with the guidelines and I wasn’t sure what to do so I could only try to calm him down.

&gt; “He hung up the phone and when I tried to call him back I couldn’t get through. It was very upsetting. I spent the rest of the day worried that he may have taken his own life.

&gt; “It wasn’t until the next day that a colleague told me they spoke to him later and he didn’t go through with it.

&gt; “But I know of colleagues who have been told by claimants that they are going to commit suicide and they have done so. It’s devastating for them.”

&gt; Scottish Minister for Social Justice, SNP MSP Alex Neil, denounced the six-point plan and urged  Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to rethink his policies.

&gt; He said: “I would call on him to immediately withdraw his six-point plan and bin it because it’s playing a dangerous game with people’s lives.

&gt; “It is totally outrageous and unacceptable to put his staff in the position of playing God. They are not medically qualified to properly assess anyone with mental health problems. This is a recipe for tragedy.  

&gt; “What this is doing is putting people in real danger because if people are assessed wrongly and they are already feeling suicidal it could drive somebody over the edge. This is utterly the wrong thing to do and Iain Duncan Smith should immediately withdraw these guidelines, apologise and have an immediate rethink of the policy.

&gt; “It shows total disregard for the wellbeing of the benefit claimant and the DWP staff who are being put in this invidious position. Quite frankly, it’s morally wrong.

&gt; “The UK Government is leaving itself open to the charge that this six-point plan is an admission that its welfare reforms are putting people at risk. You could draw that conclusion. That is the implication of what they are doing.”

&gt; Lynn Henderson, Scottish secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents many of the DWP staff, also criticised the procedures, saying: “For most of us the thought of suicide is unimaginable but for PCS members in DWP the unimaginable is becoming harsh reality.

&gt; “As benefits are cut, people in desperate need are finding they cannot contemplate a future worth living for – and DWP’s solution is to ask overburdened staff, who are under enormous pressure themselves, to take responsibility for spotting whether members of the public are likely to take their own lives or not.  

&gt; “It’s disgraceful that this Government, rather than recognising that its own policies are driving people to despair, is applying sticking-plaster solutions by asking our low-paid, undervalued members to take on what are literally life-or-death responsibilities.”

&gt; A DWP spokesman said: “Our frontline Jobcentre staff work hard every day supporting people to find jobs and it is only right we provide a range of training and guidance to assist them in their work.”

Blair himself is the great example. A huge number of Blair's signature policies, causes and decisions - e.g. top-up fees, support for euro membership, Iraq - were always radically unpopular amongst the electorate. Nobody does as many unpopular things as Blair did in order to win votes.

Nick Clegg is the other recent example. The Labour/Guardian narrative about the Lib Dems sacrificing principles for power always relied on this arrogant assumption that the Lib Dems' principles were the same as Labour's. It ignored that the coalition agreement was packed with liberal measures, most of which Labour treated as trivial or outright negative, but that mattered enormously to the Lib Dems' actual liberal values: scrapping ID cards, scrapping the DNA database, voting reform, Lords reform, ending child detention in immigration centres, achieving the UN target on international aid spending, etc.",null,0,null,1440333807,null,null,false,0,cucr1ue,null,t3_3i2irw,null,null,null,t3_3i2irw,null,null,null,1441420502,null,12,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,12,null

null,null,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,null,"&gt; No, it's not. Even with basic understanding of economics and socialism it's fairly obvious that they contradict each other. To make it even more obvious, pretty much all former socialist countries are poor and their economies totally failed.

Many got poorer after communist rule, the population of post-communist Russia shrank - people staved as they had become too poor to eat, they'd always had enough before, this was even as many Russians became billionaires. Many in former socialist countries (the majority in some) still say they were better under communist rule.

In current socialist countries, Cuba has managed to provide universal healthcare, GDP rocketed and poverty reduced massively in Venezuela under Hugo Chavez's rule, and this was despite both countries suffering embargoes and constant foreign backed coup attempts and attempts to destabilize the government.

&gt; Seriously? The Guardian is a left wing newspaper, so their certainly aren't neutral

Irrelevant, this was a quote from those economists not the Guardians view (and on balance the Guardian is anti-Corbyn).

&gt;  Also it's true that a lot of economists question ""austerity"" but austerity isn't really an economic term. E.g. most economists think that reforms are good but might question making certain cuts during a crisis. It's not black/white. People that think that you can be for or against austerity are just stupid. It's much more complicated. 

Austerity is an economic term. It means a programme of spending cuts and/or tax rises to bring the budget deficit under control. Most economists where against austerity until the economy had recovered (which arguably it still hasn't). And some say it not a good idea in any circumstances. You may disagree with them, but they aren't stupid.

&gt; Yes, and not a bad one but that was 150 years ago when there wasn't even data about the economy available. He wasn't all wrong but some of his fundamental assumption have been proven wrong.

Edit: Easier to answer all the disapproval at once. A good waiter also needs training, which many of the restaurants I worked in don't provide fully. It's usually just ""this is how you talk about the brand we are making you push on the customers"", not ""this is the difference between a Rioja and a Merlot"", ""this is why, generally, Malbec goes with steak"". You have to go out and learn that on your own.

null,null,grogleberry,null,null,null,"&gt;Here's where I disagree: I think we need to take the game to them, much like we did in the 13/14 season. Arsenal don't like it when teams attack relentlessly: their players can't link up with no space, and pressing constantly would stop them creating their passing game. A midfield trio of Lucas, Milner and Can would provide enough energy to complete this task, I think. Obviously having Hendo would be preferable, but I think Milner will fill that hole as best as possible.

I'd agree but I just don't think we've really shown that we have the fluidity in attack to pin them back yet.

My idea is that you make it an awful game of football that mostly takes place in the middle third and get a 0-0 draw, or if we do concede, nick a goal from a set piece, from range or get Benteke to score a very number-niney sort of goal, like a punt up field to him and an isolated defender or a deep cross.",null,0,null,1440334124,null,null,false,0,cucr5g2,null,t3_3i2fl0,null,null,null,t1_cucpkfq,null,null,null,1441420549,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

&gt; Corbyn's call for a 'strategic state' is, of course, articulated with leftist, redistributive policies. But it's worth thinking about who is threatened by it. I don't think it's big business, as such, because from the point of view of sustaining long-term development and growth, this is quite sensible and moderate stuff - easily affordable by British capitalism. I don't think it's the CBI, and I'm not even sure the entirety of the financial class would find it difficult to live with. My sense is that it's the power bloc in the state, the neoliberal factions in all the dominant parties, and the media and a big chunk of the academia, that would find this most threatening.

null,null,chrisjd,,JezWeCan,null,"&gt; This is the thing that really really pisses me off about the hard-left's attitude to the centre. They make this snobbish and arrogant assumption that centrists are actually just fellow Trotskyites who have sacrificed their principles for ministerial cars in a moment of great cowardice and treachery. Heaven forbid that a centrist is actually just a principled person pursuing a different set of principles to yours.

It doesn't help that the centrist candidates in the Labour leadership election whole argument against Corbyn was that he was unelectable. They didn't say what their policies were and explain how they were better, only that they thought they would be more palatable with the wider electorate. It's the way many on the right of Labour do talk these days, they spend endless time talking about what will win people over, it shows they do value power over principle, and what's worse is it doesn't work as the public aren't going to trust a politician they know is only telling them what they think they want to hear.

&gt; Nick Clegg is the other recent example. The Labour/Guardian narrative about the Lib Dems sacrificing principles for power always relied on this arrogant assumption that the Lib Dems' principles were the same as Labour's. It ignored that the coalition agreement was packed with liberal measures, most of which Labour treated as trivial or outright negative, but that mattered enormously to the Lib Dems' actual liberal values: scrapping ID cards, scrapping the DNA database, voting reform, Lords reform, ending child detention in immigration centres, achieving the UN target on international aid spending, etc.

Well it seems the public agreed with the Labour/Guardian narrative, seeing how the Lib Dems got destroyed in the general election. It seems many of their former voters did think Lib Dems' principles were at least similar to Labours, which is why they punished them for going into coalition with the Tories.",null,0,null,1440334391,null,null,false,0,cucr8j4,null,t3_3i2irw,null,null,null,t1_cucr1ue,null,null,null,1441420589,null,10,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,10,null

After contributing much more to the UK than it received during the second half of the 20th century Scotland really shouldn't need to be subsidised by England every time the oil price drops. More of the money should have been invested in other parts of the Scottish economy. But instead Thatcher used the high oil revenues of the 80s to push a neoliberal agenda that Western Scotland has never recovered from.

Though really it's Northern England that gets it by far the worst. Sure, the South subsidises the rest of the country, but there's no reason that the it should be so much more prosperous than the North. It's not as if the South has some precious natural resource or it's people are harder working or it's institutions make better decisions. 

The UK's regional imbalances are the creation of a government that is completely focused on the Southeast. I mean London received *24 times* the investment per head of population than the Northeast of England last year.

In Scotland we get a fair deal because we would just leave otherwise, but North England and Wales just get shat on.

I've setup the DGN2200 because despite being 5 years older than the Superhub 2, it's wifi range and speed is far superior (I live in an awkward shaped apartment and found the Superhub 2g wifi to be weak as shit beyond more than 1 wall).",null,0,null,1440334830,null,null,false,0,cucrdnt,null,t3_3i2b15,null,null,null,t1_cucqltt,null,null,null,1441420656,null,4,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

For years the BBC has not really ""broadcast"" anything. They sold off their transmission arm (and then rented the same services from the winning buyer) under Major, and then under Blair they sold off the playout arm (and then rented the same services from the winning buyer). IIRC under Blair they transferred and outsourced IT/phones to Siemens, and I think a lot of their facilities/studios went under Brown

The transmission arm was British for a while, but is now owned by an Australian investment bank. The playout arm was bought by the same Australian investment bank, though they were run as two different companies. It is now owned by Ericsson, of mobile phone fame (who also run ITV/Ch4/Ch5's broadcast systems)

At this point they basically commission programmes (some of which involve outside broadcasts provided by an external firm, or studios that are probably owned by an external firm), and hand them to Ericsson (and other contractors along the way) to be transformed into a signal to be sent up to satellites and via transmitters into the air, via a different external firm",null,0,null,1440334831,null,null,1440335207,0,cucrdoa,null,t3_3i0ixv,null,null,null,t1_cucmfy4,null,null,null,1441420656,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Some may work best as a co-operative model, others may work best in a more traditional model. Either way, my main concern is that *however* the business is structured, the government's job is to ensure that every employee benefits from the success of the company, whether that means employees as shareholders or simply a mechanism to ensure a fair wage across the board.

My biggest fear is that the investor / shareholder structure results in an unaccountable, profit-driven mentality which inevitably seeks to reduce employee costs rather than investing in those employees and recognising their worth. When employees are seen more as a cost to be reduced, there is a problem.

Ultimately I think a significantly larger welfare state is more or less inevitable if we want to avoid going back to slums, destitution and the workhouses. Endless growth is not a sustainable approach, especially when we also seem hell-bent on also sticking to unsustainable energy sources.

For those not aware, from the moment you sign up via the online form it takes 5 weeks to receive any money. To have something to get you by, you  call a a centre which assess you for an advance payment which means you borrow money out of your future benefits and pay it back over 6 months off of those benefits. 

I took out the loan as there was simply no other option. After paying my bills and making a partial payment towards my rent, I have one week left to go before receiving money (this Friday). In the meantime, I have run out of food. On Friday I requested a foobank referral and was given food (making a 4 hour round trip by foot) which was enough to last me until tomorrow. 

In the space of four weeks I've packed in way more than the required 35 hours of job searching they want. I've got my third interview on Tuesday.

Every single thing is made difficult. For example, I had an interview last week at 2pm and the call centre booked me an appointment with my job coach at 4pm on the same day. I told them that the location of the interview and having to get a combination of bus and train means that it would be impossible to make it to my job centre appointment on time. I was told that in that case I will be sanctioned for not attending. I finally made my case and they said they would change the appointment to four hours *before* my interview. That required me to walk 40mins to job centre, sign a form to say I would make a new CV, then walk 40mins back home before getting the train out for my interview. It was stressful and unnecessary. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant but no wonder people are phoning up claiming to be suicidal. It's a lot of nonsense. I pray I get this job on Tuesday so I can get out of this shit.

Edit: I've had some offers of cash to help see me by but I'm fine for now so there is no need. Just counting down the days and I will stretch it out. Cheers for the thoughts.

Id do the CBT 1st of all, you might find bikes just arent for you. I got a helmet and did my CBT on my 16th birthday.

Regards to waiting until ready to buy a bike before doing CBT, your CBT runs out in 2 years, so if it will take you another 6 months, it might be worth just waiting. Also, make sure you have cash saved up for..

* Helmet, (optionals but advised - gloves, jacket, maybe jeans and boots)
* Insurance, get some quotes
* CBT
* A bike
* Maintenance, chain cleaner + lube, paddock stand (if no centre stand), services, if not, oil &amp; filters if you do it yourself

&gt; How does it work?
&gt; 
&gt; We’ll switch on a separate internet connection to your Super Hub, which will become part of the WiFi network. Rest assured the broadband you love and pay for will stay exclusively yours – and remain just as secure. [ISPr Editor’s Note: There will be a separate IP address for the public WiFi element].
&gt; 
&gt; Do I need to do anything?
&gt; 
&gt; You don’t have to lift a finger – there’s no installation, cables or faff. Just sit back and enjoy your broadband as you do now. We’ll be back in touch to let you know when it’s up and running, so you can download our new app and get connected to the hotspots in your area.

No, because being head of state involves (and has always involved) a measure of engaging with the distasteful. In fact if it were up to me, then no, TB &amp; co shouldn't be doing deals with the Saudis. But they only meet with Saudis etc. because that's part of being a head of state - helping GB companies to win contracts, secure assistance in defence capabilities, creating allies.

JC isn't engaging with anti-semites &amp; Hamas &amp; Hezbollah for any of those reasons. He is going out of his way to appear with them, support them and praise him. This isn't something that is part of world diplomacy, this is his personal choice. 

Yes, it does matter to me if someone is supporting anti semitic misogynists. It indicates they have poor judgement and that fighting anti-semitism and misogyny abroad is not a priority of them.

Donald Rumsfeld was part of the ruling govt. though and on official govt. business. I'm pretty sure he was there to further a diplomatic goal, not because he loved Hussein and agreed with all his policies.

null,null,BroyRodgson,lfc12,,null,"Man, I always forget that he's 24 and has 3 top flight seasons under his belt. Don't see how I didn't contribute to discussion though. I fear for Gomez and Moreno (and Lovren). They all are prone to being pulled out of position. Moreno showed it last season with the prime example being the United game. Lovren has consistently showed it too. Gomez showed signs of it last game, but that's because he's so young and no PL experience. We will concede I think, the movement of Ozil and Alexis is of the clever kind that will pull most players out of position. I think Can will have issues with this too if we tell him to sit, people tend to forget that he's also vastly inexperienced as a player. Can deserves more freedom to move, as you suggest. 

Milner is the best shout to partner Lucas. He made the most ball recoveries against Bournemouth and is a fine reader of the game. He showed this in our pre-season as well. I just miss Allen because he's very, very good at releasing our attacking players. He's got an eye for those short passes that can cut their midfield and find Coutinho. Milner should be a good guy to have in his role though, so I won't miss Allen too much. 

In the end I think it's a question about their midfield. Their DM situation isn't particularly great and that is very good news for us. When we've gotten results against them there has always been an issue between the DM and the advanced midfielders. The kind of issue that Coutinho will thrive in.",null,0,null,1440336312,null,null,false,0,cucrw7k,null,t3_3i1z30,null,null,null,t1_cucph0i,null,null,null,1441420899,null,1,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Now you're saying that the problem is that he has associated with those people.

Which one is it?

Corbyn has associated with people who horrible views, sure. He's a politician. That's more or less his job - to encourage a diplomatic and political resolution to problems, rather than self-righteously denouncing everyone.

A failure to personally and publicly denounce individuals or organisations does not mean that he agrees with the positions and statements made by those individuals or organisations, nor does donating to an ostensibly good cause mean that he is an anti-semite.

JC has stated numerous times that he views any kind of anti-semitism, racism, prejudice etc as a bad thing. What do you actually want him to do that doesn't involve actively making bad situations worse?

You don't have to be an anti-semite to criticise the actions of Israel, just like you don't have to be racist to have a negative opinion of immigration.

Call it what you will, but I don't get the impression that JC is an anti-semite. It's fine for the rest of us to denounce groups like Hamas, but in the political arena a more nuanced approach is obviously required. Nobody gets anywhere if all anybody does is grandstand. Actual discussions need to happen.

Either the various actors involved learn to talk and actively encourage discussion, or we just agree to close them out forever and deal with the consequences. Personally, I feel the former is a better approach.

I'm not really sure what kind of solution you'd like to see to this, to be honest. JC prefers to talk to people, and it seems to me like he stays more or less true to this ideal. Denouncing people and refusing to meet people seems an odd way to achieve anything, really. We can hold the opinion that Hamas are an abhorrent group whilst still acknowledging the power and influence they have. We don't get to live in a fantasy world where we can simply bomb our way to peace, unfortunately.

1) Corbyn's association with DYR. He has donated to DYR (by his own admission). Here is a link to the DYR blog http://blog.deiryassin.org/. As you can see, its most recent post is holocaust denial. 

2) Stephen Sizer will be at a conference in Iran which aims to ""“unveil the secrets behind the dominance of the Zionist lobby over US and EU politics."" Also going are lots of holocaust deniers. Stephen Sizer also linked to anti-semitic material on his blog. He thinks 9/11 was orchestrated by Israel. 

3) Corbyn calling Hamas &amp; Hezbollah his friends http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1198729/Labour-MP-Jeremy-Corbyn-Friends-Hamas-Hezbollah.html. I can't find the longer video where he praises their human rights record.

4) He praised Raed Salah as an ""honoured man"". Quote from Raed Salah: ""We have never allowed ourselves to knead [the dough for] the bread that breaks the fast in the holy month of Ramadan with children’s blood. Whoever wants a more thorough explanation, let him ask what used to happen to some children in Europe, whose blood was mixed in with the dough of the holy bread"".

null,null,notaukrainian,null,null,null,"You are misrepresenting my position. The issue is not that he has appeared with anti-semites - it is that he has written in support of, donated to and hosted anti-semites.

If he has simply been in the same room as some unpleasant people, then whatever - unfortunate, poor judgement but ultimately no biggie.

""Corbyn has associated with people who horrible views, sure. He's a politician. That's more or less his job - to encourage a diplomatic and political resolution to problems, rather than self-righteously denouncing everyone.""

How is that his job? He is not in government. He is not a peace negotiator. He has voluntarily allied himself to the pro-palestine movement. Fine. But he has gone further, and supported the worst, most anti-semitic &amp; hateful sections of the pro-palestine campaign. Additionally, he has made no attempt to talk to radical Israelis or radical Ulster Unionists.

""A failure to personally and publicly denounce individuals or organisations does not mean that he agrees with the positions and statements made by those individuals or organisations, nor does donating to an ostensibly good cause mean that he is an anti-semite.""

I am not asking him to denounce anyone. I am simply pointing out that he has *actively supported* anti-semites. It is not a high bar to request that the leader of a political party doesn't invite avowed, out-and-out anti-semites for tea at the HoC or write in support of them or donate to them.

Do you think DYR is a good cause? Eisen has been an obvious anti-semite for some time. Take a look at the DYR blog (basically wall-to-wall holocaust denial) http://blog.deiryassin.org/. Do you think it's a good cause? Do you do any due diligence on the organisations you donate to? I

""JC has stated numerous times that he views any kind of anti-semitism, racism, prejudice etc as a bad thing. What do you actually want him to do that doesn't involve actively making bad situations worse?""

How interesting. Unfortunately his distaste of anti-semitism hasn't extended to him you know, not donating to anti-semitic causes, but I suppose he's at least going through the emotions...

""You don't have to be an anti-semite to criticise the actions of Israel, just like you don't have to be racist to have a negative opinion of immigration.""

I know. I'm saying that if JC had just appeared with Hamas, or just appeared on the same platform as people from DYR, that would be more OK. But JC has gone further than that, he has donated to, written in support of and invited anti-semites to tea. 

""Call it what you will, but I don't get the impression that JC is an anti-semite. It's fine for the rest of us to denounce groups like Hamas, but in the political arena a more nuanced approach is obviously required. Nobody gets anywhere if all anybody does is grandstand. Actual discussions need to happen.""

I don't think JC is in fact an anti-semite, I think he just doesn't give a shit if other people are. And yes - it's great if we can get radically opposed sides to talk to each other. So where is JC having tea with Ulster Unionists or inviting hard line Israelis to tea?

And frankly, do you think there haven't been people with racist views in the Conservative Party? Enoch Powell, Keith Joseph, Margaret Thatcher. Why aren't you pissed off about the Queen's Nazi salute, and her fascist uncle and her racist husband? And all of these people, unlike Jeremy Corbyn, held *power*. 

Heads of state do not actually have to ""engage with the distasteful"" as you tactfully put it. They could choose not to, but they chose to. As is shown by the fact that yesterday's friend becomes today's enemy very often, in Orwellian fashion. Saddam Hussein was a ""friend to the west"" before he became a ""tyrant"". The same is true of Gaddafi. 

Oh, so if we're selling them arms, then it's OK? Jeremy Corbyn talking to someone from Hamas makes him literally Stalin and Hitler, but if we can profit from selling arms to Saudis and Israelis, then that makes it morally OK!

If it's morally wrong to talk to people who advocate and engage in force, then it's morally wrong no matter who does it. In fact, one could argue that it's *worse* if done by heads of state for financial benefit. You are actually arguing that being a hypocrite, engaging in realpolitik, embracing despots who you must pretend to like, is somehow morally better than being sincere and following your own conscience in these matters. 

If it matters to you if someone is supporting anti semitic misogynists, then why are you not at 10 Downing Street every time Cameron meets with the Saudis? 

Why on earth should fighting anti-Semitism be a priority of a British Prime Minister? It doesn't have anything directly to do with Britain. His priority should be sorting out the mess that is right here, right now, on this island. 

Rumsfeld was part of the official government and on official business. So what? If anything, that makes him shaking hands with Saddam *much worse*. You can't excuse association and support of these people on the grounds that ""we wanted to further a diplomatic goal"". That doesn't make selling him arms and weapons to gas Kurds OK. 

Why are you so obsessed with anti-Semitism, and only anti-Semitism? Isn't it a bad thing if any group is hated or attacked or discriminated against? Or do you only care about one group?

I'm increasingly annoyed with Corbyn's posturing.

null,null,notaukrainian,null,null,null,"I don't think JC is anti-semitic. But his support of, material donations to and invitations to the HoC of anti-semites shows that at the very least he doesn't really care. I find that unacceptable.

""And frankly, do you think there haven't been people with racist views in the Conservative Party? Enoch Powell, Keith Joseph, Margaret Thatcher. Why aren't you pissed off about the Queen's Nazi salute, and her fascist uncle and her racist husband? And all of these people, unlike Jeremy Corbyn, held power.""

Well none of those people are current politicians - if they were around now I would be pissed off! We are talking about JC - that's why I'm focusing on JC.

Also the Queen made a nazi salute when she was 6.

""Oh, so if we're selling them arms, then it's OK? Jeremy Corbyn talking to someone from Hamas makes him literally Stalin and Hitler, but if we can profit from selling arms to Saudis and Israelis, then that makes it morally OK!""

Err what? It's not OK, it's just more understandable. The only explanation I can come up with as to why JC constantly associates with anti-semites is that he doesn't care that much. The explanation for us selling arms to Saudi is that we want to make money. I mean it's not great either but it's much more understandable.

I never called Corbyn Hitler or Stalin - I just pointed out (correctly) that he has never denounced the anti-semitism rife in the pro-palestine movement where people routinely chant ""Hitler was right"".

""If it matters to you if someone is supporting anti semitic misogynists, then why are you not at 10 Downing Street every time Cameron meets with the Saudis?""

I'm not outside JC's house now, so why would I be outside Downing street?? Like I said, we associate with the Saudis for strategic defence reasons (having an ally in the Middle East) &amp; money. Yeah, it's not great. But it's more understandable due to the geopolitical pressures &amp; economic pressures of govt. JC's only reason to associate with anti-semites is because that's what he wants to do. There's no other external pressure forcing him to do this...

""Why on earth should fighting anti-Semitism be a priority of a British Prime Minister? It doesn't have anything directly to do with Britain. His priority should be sorting out the mess that is right here, right now, on this island.""

I'm just saying it would be nice to know that my prime minister wouldn't invite anti-semites to the HoC as prime minister. Or racists or misogynists. 

""Rumsfeld was part of the official government and on official business. So what? If anything, that makes him shaking hands with Saddam much worse. You can't excuse association and support of these people on the grounds that ""we wanted to further a diplomatic goal"". That doesn't make selling him arms and weapons to gas Kurds OK.""

Why do you have this bizarre double standard where you moan about Rumsfeld selling arms to gas Kurds, but Corbyn associating with an organisation that wants to kill all jews is A OK? I mean I can see your issue with Rumsfeld. I don't think it's great and I would support us not doing business with Saudis/nasty regimes in the future, but I understand that Rumsfeld was doing this for a specific reason...but because he personally hates Kurds.

Why don't you care about anti-semitism?

null,null,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,null,"I don't get this comment. Andy776's explanation is correct - cable networks are highly shared.

In fact, ADSL is the opposite. You do get a dedicated connection between the home and  the exchange (or cabinet for VDSL) - it's the connection from there onwards that is shared (but can be easily made to be much higher than total demand, so it is not an issue if managed properly)

The main issue with *DSL is the distance one - that your maximum speed is primarily determined by line length.

So

&gt; their infrastructure can deliver 400Mbps to the home, even though their current highest bandwidth product is at 150Mbps (with plans to go to 300).

That 400Mbps (it's probably a bit more than that - 4, 8 or 16 50Mbps channels) will be shared between tens or even hundreds of people in your local area. It's not dedicated to you.

&gt; Vrigin has much more capacity that that

Nope. Not in the local network. As things stand, a handful of 150Mbps users in the same area (Virgin's current maximum) all using their connections to the fullest at the same time, can potentially ruin it for everyone else 

The hope is that this is unlikely to happen, and generally it doesn't, but there are places where customers do experience crap speeds and require upgrades

&gt;  If there is a contention, it will happen much further away from a neighbourhood. 

In practice, it is the neighbourhood where the contention happens. Or ""overutilisation"" as Virgin likes to call it. That's why, in the not too distant past, they used ""STM"" - i.e. download or upload too much and they'll knobble your speed for a few hours. They can have masses of capacity into their network of headends, the bottleneck is and has always been between home and headend",null,0,null,1440338574,null,null,1440339048,0,cucsqwn,null,t3_3i2b15,null,null,null,t1_cucpnod,null,null,null,1441421301,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,RifleEyez,null,null,null,"I totally agree. We *desperately* need a CM with experience who can slot straight in, regardless of if they're over 30 (look at Cambiasso, for example) and perhaps another. I know we have the stadium to think about, but with the TV money, some high earners sold of the wage bill and yet again we have a positive net spend so we need to drop a fair chunk on a couple of players that can come straight into the  side. 

Also, this effects all the teams above us too. It is already; look at the top 4 who have dropped points so far. 

Sure, 2 points in 3 games isn't ideal. We all thought initially ''meh, draw/loss vs United, wins in the other 2 games''. But Leicester have started the season well, and we were away. Stoke have strengthened, we played well the first half and a penalty call started the capitulation there. Plus, we arguably were the better side vs United and were unlucky to come out of it with nothing. We could be looking at 7 points instead of 2 had we not switched off vs Stoke and Leicester and got something deservedly out of the United game. 

Also there's a lot of rust with players; the season doesn't really 'start' as such till the window is closed I find. This period is like a 'limbo' where some players are gonna be sold and bought in. But I'm worried come 35 games into the season we'll be kicking ourselves about dropping points as the margins will be really fine again, I guarantee it.

Fair enough, most people on Reddit don't admit when they made a mistake.

&gt; I personally don't see why 'hard to get into' is a valid ethical reason for why someone deserves more resources in life.

It's not so much 'hard to get into' on its own, but rather the stacked CV and top level uni degrees and interview skills required to get into IB mean that these people are very intelligent, very resourceful and very skilled and they've been working towards IB from the age of, say 15/16. I would think that the hourly pay and working conditions these people get is actually fairly shite given how hard they worked to get in and stay in a very ruthless field. I chose medicine over IB because it's a more relaxed, interesting field with decent pay and I am perfectly happy with bank slaves picking up larger yearly pay packets than me as a result of that choice.

&gt; The marketability of one's skills, talents, and the opportunities to use them being something of a roulette. I think perhaps we may differ in the extent to which we'd agree on that.

Possibly. I feel that the marketability of skills and the extent of those skills should play a huge part in determining salary. If you show me two guys who work equally as hard at their jobs but one is more qualified then, IMO, all other things being equal, the more qualified guy should be making more as his skills are more marketable.

&gt; I can't give you a job that is definitively 'harder', since my point is that that is an insulting statement to present as fact.

I wouldn't say insulting, I'd say subjective. My original comment didn't say that IB was the hardest field, anyway, just that it was very, very hard work in general. The salary that these guys earn, misleading as they are, are also a function of their very high level academic skills and their education, which open doors that aren't necessarily open for people who dropped out of school after GCSEs.

&gt; Any kind of heavy physical job will be demanding and straining on the body, will literally require harder work in calorific terms.

True, but a warehouse worker's skills are not necessarily as elite, niche or unique as graduates who get into IB. An IB analyst could become an average warehouse worker but I'm not so sure the opposite is true.

&gt; Military, law enforcement, emergency response and care work are examples of careers that can be psychologically very taxing.

The lacklustre candidates of the centre aren't trying to convince people to support them, as they are relying on insulting Corbyn and the whole ""blairite"" Schick of ""them having to vote for us""

Corbyn's supporters have been absolutely horrid. They have made Corbyn out to be Jesus. Who's word is final and absolute. Any dissenting opinions will be crowded out, downvoted and dismissed out of hand because you dared to go against the dear leader.

They have produced a naive narrative that everyone who doesn't vote is left wing, which has added to this pedestal of Jeremy Corbyn.

Jeremy himself has benefited form position himself as someone with ""principles"" compared to others, which is a big fat lie, all politicians have principles, its just easier for the harder left and right to articulate it more than the centre. 

He also isn't going to command any sort of cohesion in the Labour party due to his past, and his a massive pariah in the media.

I can see the headlines now ""You thought Red Ed was bad, you haven't seen anything yet"".

The whole process of ""anyone who pays £3 can vote"" is also stupid, it is of course going to be open to abuse, because anyone can vote, and Labour will only make themselves look even more stupid if it is found out that people have sabotaged the vote. Whoever is leader will have their legitimacy questioned until they step down.

It has also dragged on for too long, which has given plenty of ammo for the Conservatives and SNP to use against Labour in 5 years time.

null,null,benshere,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; Asked if acts of violence against those who publish images of the Prophet Muhammad can ""never be justified"", 68% agreed that such violence was never justifiable.
But **24% disagreed with the statement**, while the rest replied ""don't know"" or refused to answer.


whats hilarious is how biased BBC were in producing those statistics, isn't the bigger story that 24% think violence is ok sometimes over cartoons? when broadcast on the radio they neglected to mention that statistic, and if you compare the same article to other news outlets, BBC tried to give the statistics the most positive spin and put the statistics they liked in big bold letters on an info graph, while left the above information in a small paragraph.

so yeah I do hate it when idiots misuse statistics.

you'll notice the last link also is a website that puts statistics into context about freedom of speech, and yet it still looks bad.

* Avoid LG.  Had numerous problems with their LED TVs, and their engineers were clueless.  Also came stuffed full of ""Smart TV"" features which couldn't be removed (are there *really* that many K-pop viewers in the UK?)

* Panasonic have been pretty good.  Some of their models come with SCART adapters if that's what you need.  The Android based remote control app is handy - but not terribly good.

* Use a showroom to check for size - but ignore picture quality. All showrooms have the brightness out of what to make the picture look more eye-catching in florescent lighting.

* Motion compensation can usually be turned adjusted - as can sharpness, brightness, sound levels.

* Download the manual from the manufacturer's website before buying - make sure it does everything you want it to.

* Most TVs now have iPlayer - which is excellent. Check whether they also have C4, ITV, etc - and if it'll work with your parents' internet connection.

* Finally, all TVs are FreeView HD as standard.  I'm assuming your folks can pick up FreeView with their aerial.

Edinburgh is as expensive as Aberdeen, which is not cheap either. It has pretty poor transport links too which puts me off.

Without a damned good reason I'm starting to say there's no point coming back. Accommodation prices have rocketed and unless you're going to have a ton of disposable income for going out at night there are better, less divided cities to spend your time in.

Well, people say a lot of stupid things. E.g. most people in Eastern Germany thought that they don't have to be scared of the government as long as they comply with everything. But it's well proven that the government randomly arrested people and people were set up and things like that. Also people have a general tendency to romanticize the past, that's also true for capitalist countries (e.g. the 50s/60s are often presented as some perfect wonderland). However, the point is that socialist countries did worse RELATIVE to capitalist ones.

&gt; Cuba has managed to provide universal healthcare

yeah but that's pretty much it. Just because they could get a few things right doesn't mean that their economy is still a complete failure. Cuba is a poor country. Also they are a dictatorship with massive human rights violations. 

&gt; GDP rocketed and poverty reduced massively in Venezuela under Hugo Chavez's rule,

Are you joking?! Venezuela is a totally failed country. They are basically sitting on money (oil) but can't even extract it. Chavez couldn't even keep production constant and the economy is totally ruined now. It's the perfect example of how socialism make everyone equal: everyone become poor, except a few socialists at the top. Also Chavez basically destroyed democracy, so there's that too.

&gt; Irrelevant, this was a quote from those economists not the Guardians view 

Yeah a pro Corbyn economist. That really doesn't proof anything. The whole point was pro Corbyn propaganda, that's why they wrote this letter in the first place.

&gt; It means a programme of spending cuts and/or tax rises to bring the budget deficit under control.

So here we go, what is that supposed to mean? Which taxes and which spending is changed? It makes a big difference. Again it's not a yes or no question.

&gt;  You may disagree with them, but they aren't stupid.

Being against or for austerity is more a political thing then an economic one. Economists would focus on details and not generally reject or accept everything and the ones that do are indeed idiots. So are all the politicians and people that follow them. It's the thinking like people that are for/against immigration. It's not a yes or no thing but some people are too stupid and need to simplify everything.

Every year over the past few years, the gap between the top teams and the rest has been closed. I think our team is actually one of the best we've ever had. With one or two more additions, this will be a very very good team with a great coach. The thing is most of the other teams in the league (except Sunderland) have gained enormously from the extra TV revenue and most now have good coaches who have been in the post for a decent amount of time. Clubs are now starting to see the sense in stability. I think this year the points needed to get into the top 6/7 will be lower than ever before. As you can see with the Chelsea-West Brom match today and the ManU-Newcastle match yesterday, no win is guaranteed now. The gap between each team is definitely getting smaller. In regards to people complaining about us not going for certain players, we can't sign everyone. And as Pochettino has said publically more times than I can count, he wants VERY specific players, not just any old player with good potential who turns into a world-class player on FM. Milner wanted huge wages, which Liverpool could offer but we couldn't. I certainly wouldn't want the club to give a player on the verge of turning 30 over £100,000 a week which would be completely out of sync with the club's wage structure. Players from the eredivisie like Clasie and Wijnaldum are good but they're obviously not what we wanted. In the post-Bale era the club has realised that we have to spend wisely and we have.

You actually have just said that something becomes morally better if we can make money from it. Think about the implications of that for a minute. 

Jeremy Corbyn doesn't have to denounce everything that people say who he might have met once, any more than David Cameron has to denounce everything that the Saudis do. 

You might be outside Downing Street to protest because it seems to mean a lot to you, and also because the people involved actually have *power*, the power of life and death very often. 

Once again, if something is morally wrong, you can't excuse it by saying that it's OK because you get some advantage out of it. That's like saying, it's OK that I'm friends with that criminal because he gives me a share of his stolen money. Absolutely morally reprehensible, much worse than anything Jeremy Corbyn has ever done. 

Corbyn doesn't ""want to associate with anti-Semites"". He has just spoken to people from Hamas. It's not the same thing. 

Like I said, I highly doubt that he ever will become Prime Minister, so his foreign policy is a bit of a moot point. 

I'll tell you why I have this ""double standard"" as you put it. I've already mentioned this several times now. Because Rumsfeld, Blair, Cameron, Thatcher, etc, have *power*. That means they can actually effect people's lives, they can take decisions that can mean that people will die. That's not something you can say about Jeremy Corbyn, a lefty backbencher who has been on the margins of his party for decades. 

Again, associating with people like Saddam etc, because we get some advantage out of it, and turning a blind eye when he gasses Kurds, is morally *much, much worse* than anything Jeremy Corbyn has ever done.

Especially with 11 men behind the ball; they had their *strikers* defending almost on the edge of their box. Even the better playmakers would struggle to break that down, we've seen it time and time again when teams defend so deep. I don't blame Lamela at all.

I lived in Edinburgh for a year (I did a Master's there), it's awesome. It's not _that_ expensive really, certainly not compared to London.

I wouldn't want to live in London. But there is more to the UK than London. I loved Exeter when I lived there too. Also I can't drive and it's been annoying when moving but hasn't been a major problem so far.

Have you lived abroad before? Because I wouldn't underestimate how different it is - like I had lived in Germany during my summers at Uni as I got paid to work in labs there and although I really loved Berlin it still felt good to get home.

It took a long time to get used to Edinburgh too and that was with the same language. The language really makes things a lot harder because it will remain a barrier until you are very good at it and that can take years.

**Plenty of positives**. The terry red card was an absolute farce and it should get successfully appealed. Before that we looked like we would be comfortable winners despite West Brom’s first goal. Impossible not to talk about the good without talking about **Pedro’s** debut. He’s definitely the real deal and we should all be excited. What was particularly refreshing was having chances being generated from the right. I think **Hazard** is still finding his full form but having danger on both sides is really going to improve our offensive side. **Diego** also had a great game. Worked incredibly hard and really caused problems. His goal was a tap in but I think he would’ve been on the scoresheet again if we had 11 men for the full 90. Talking about goals? How about **DAVE**. So happy for him, first league goal and what a goal. Hope I can find a photo of him tapping the badge and looking unbelievably happy. I am going to get an Azpi third kit to commemorate this game now :) Lastly **Zomua**. What a talent he will be. He is so strong in the air and athletic. His speed in tracking back is very impressive and when we go defensive he clears the ball very well and works super hard to close the opposition out. I don’t think he’s quite ready to displace Terry/Cahill but he’s definitely part of our defence’s future.


**Now the bad**… *Fabregas* and *Ivanovic* really didn’t step up again. Fab’s passing was substandard and he barely made an impact. Ivanovic was at fault for the first goal and really didn’t inspire going forward or shoring up the back. I don’t think Baba will be able to jump into the first squad but Iva really has to sort himself out before things get ugly and we drop more points. I think *Willian* will cop some flack but I thought he put in a good workload around the park. That sitter was absolutely criminal to miss but I appreciate that he is trying to force errors. Still think Oscar is our 10! Finally, Matic was a bit sloppy today. The penalty really was bad and big ups to Courtois for the save. 


All up, a win with 10 men is a massive result. Still plenty to improve on but 3 goals from open play is fantastic. We have been lacking goals and this shows we’ve still got it!!

**KTBFFH**

TL;DR
Great game from Pedro, Diego, Azpi and Happy.

Now, realistically speaking, every nation's going to try and craft these agreements to their own national interest (its what nations do) and the USA isn't any different. 

However, I'm not particularly worried about the US being the main influencer in these deals. A united EU can counter the more unsavoury parts of American interest, but for the most part we share common interests with the US, far more than the interests of say, China, and I don't see how these trade deals are going to be particularly harmful. 

Oh, and as has been repeated ad nauseum on these sub-reddits: Trade deals are negotiated in secret so that other parties (namely multinational corporations and the press) don't influence and stall what are already long and difficult debates. Once a treaty has been agreed on, it will be submitted for the approval of the national parliaments concerned- that's when we decide wherever to approve the deal or not.  For this reason, I'm sceptical of the video's claim that corporations have been influencing these negotiations- that shouldn't be happening.

See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/3hso8v/gerry_kelly_and_fellow_ira_prisoners_planned/cucsxjn). I responded to another user who raised this same issue. 


Any way now we're adding something on to your definition of terrorist that was oh so simple to begin with.


""""Terrorist - a person who uses terrorism in the pursuit of political aims. ""a terrorist organization"" synonyms: bomber, arsonist, incendiary; - and who are not acting on behalf of elected public servants"" 


I have a huge issue with this. ""Acting irrationally"" is a gross misrepresentation of murdering innocent civilians at a frequent rate. Locking up innocent civilians because they 'might' be in the IRA, and then calling them terrorists when they got out of jail and decided to fight back. I don't care how the Army acted ""within the laws of the land"" the laws of the land, as you said, were unfair to begin with.


&gt; mainly to preserve order and justice.


The British army themelves admitted their presence during the troubles was not to ensure peace but to destroy the IRA. They were active members in the conflict, not peacemakers. 


&gt; One can say that back in the 60s, many nationalists had reason as a unionist deadlock on government meant it WAS arduous


  I actually agree with you, towards the late eighties and the nineties IRA activity changed and became more of an attack on civilians, although it was still largely an attack on the state. But back in the sixties the Provos were still dissidents with little support. Then the British army shoot 27 civil rights protesters and then people lo and behold join the Provos to fight back?  I have my own problems with what happened later, things like the Omagh bomb that disgusts me as much as it disgusts you, but when you look at the heroics of the British army you look at what the majority of the British army did. The heroes of World War II etc etc, but I'm sure when people wear Poppies they don't intend on honouring those soldiers of Bloody Sunday do they? They probably would say ""that's not what the British army is"" and distance themselves from them right? So when I look at the IRA I don't look at the scumbags who maybe bombed Enniskillen etc etc but the IRA as a whole, and for the most part the IRA was an attack on the British army who were violent oppressors. Heroes like the Hunger Strikers. During the Troubles half the people the British army killed were innocent civilians. 50%. The IRA on the other hand? They killed only 35%. It's worth noting loyalist paramilitaries jumps to 85% and a large portion of IRA civilian killings were tit for tat killings with loyalists. 

So when people call the IRA terrorists it's not calling those bombers terrorists, it's calling a sustained attack on the British army ""terrorism"". Which when the British army are shooting innocent civilians, then it's a war. And when the soldiers of one side shoot back at the soldiers of the other it's not terrorism. 


I wouldn't call the British army soldiers of Bloody Sunday terrorists. I don't call the Omagh bombers terrorists. I don't call the IRA/UVF/UDA terrorists all because there is no fairness whatsoever in the application of the word. I would admit they are murderers but what soldiers haven't been murderers? Every war ever as involved someone killing someone. That's something I fully believe. One man's freedom fighter and all that. 

As Peter Ustinov says ""“Terrorism is the war of the poor, and war is the terrorism of the rich.” The IRA as terrorists is just propaganda by the British army because they can't *believe* the IRA would have the cheek to shoot back at them.

* Where is Fabregas? He's lost his magic hat. Gave away the ball cheaply, way too often.

Needless to say Pedro 10/10. His first goal was just his desire to run forward and brilliant footwork although a little fortunate. Injected energy into the squad. 

Costa looking much much better, but not yet last seasons form. Willian needs more experience at CAM, Oscar definitely deserves the nod for now. Ivanovic just looks a step too slow always. Soft red for JT which sucks but that's football. Zouma started slow closed out well. Cahill played a solid 2nd half. Dave really solid, and good goal. Falcao made some good runs and was energetic. Matic had a terrible start but gradually improved. 

Fabregas clearly had the vision for good plays but was just ridiculously sloppy with the passing. He needs players to make runs for his brilliance to emerge. Mikel did a good job closing out too. 

Courtois is bae.

Hopefully cuadrado and Ramires being left out although I love them both are making way for Pogba. Could really use him right now.

A quick google gives an opinion that the association with DYR was ""before DYR was taken over by antisemites and Holocaust deniers"", and that the DM article was largely based on comments by Paul Eisen.

IMO if Corbyn really isn't anti-Semitic then he should denounce anti-Semitism. Maybe he has already? (I'd like to hear him denounce PIRA as well.)

The pro-Palestinian movement doesn't make enough effort to stamp out anti-Semitism because some of their supporters are anti-Semitic. This harms their cause, but doesn't ultimately discredit it: two wrongs don't make a right.

null,null,ducksworthhh,null,null,null,"Just a couple notes I made on the game and for the start of our season in general. (my opinion)

- Dissapointed with Fabregas at the moment, just seems disenchanted, his passing hasn't been on point and he doesn't chase after that ball when he gets beaten, seems to me like he needs to put in a little bit more effort in defence.

- Ivanovic shaky once again, almost made us concede an equalizer, would love to see Baba come into the team next week, just test the waters.

- Zouma had a really good game today, with Terry out next week he'll start and I definetely want to see more of him this season, even if it means at the expense of most probably Cahill but even Terry at some points.

- Pedro had a brilliant game, was really happy with him, solid on the ball, good delivery and having 2 strong feet makes him extremely dangerous, was really happy with his performance today.

- Remy deserves to be our #2 striker, he was brilliant last year for us and is a really good striker who offers a lot, so I'm dissapointed to see Falcao get the nod over him. Falcao's only redeeming quality is his work ethic, but he's just trying too hard, and we can't have a toothless striker up front.

- Hazard was slow of the mark but had an excellent second half and an even better last 15 or so minutes, was brilliant to watch.

- Seemed to me like we were a bit relaxed at the end, even though we were (rightfully) sitting back to conserve our lead, if bloody Lambert's strolling towards goal shut him down before he actually takes his shot please...:P

- Matic had a good game, was pleased with him, good all around with his passing and tackling. Thank-god we have a player like him next to Fabregas to cover him.

- Willian had an alright game but he just has no end-product what-so-ever, his goal numbers are appaling and he basically missed a 1 on 1 today by an embarrassing margin. Would prefer when he's fit to have Oscar in that CAM role for now at least.

- Courtois had a really good game, couldn't fault him for the second goal, that was really unlucky but to save a penalty and then save a rocket of a shot like Rondon's in the dying minutes shows his class, not worried at all when we have a player of his calibre in between the sticks.

- Costa was fucking amazing and back to his fiery roots which I loved to see

AND FINALLY

- Stones would be a welcome addition to the team, and I really hope we get him. Also, with Cuadrado and Ramires both not being on the bench and both (cuadrado more-so) being heavily linked to Juve hopefully it acts as a sweetner to Juve for a move for Pogba. Pretty unrealistic I know, but he would be the perfect player for us, and with all the money we have from the TV rights, winning the league and our owner we should definetely be making the investment.

Bit shaky but hopefully we get better and better and build upon this win, good result to get a win against a Pulis side away imo. All in all a positive result! :)

I damn well am. The US is a minor on the political world stage, a mere child when it comes to international politics and their heavy handed approach for the last 150 years has been the cause of nearly every destabilisation in another country across the globe. Let's not forget this is the country that removed people from office they didn't like in OTHER COUNTRIES via the CIA and installed their own sympathetic leaders. You expect them to play fair if allowed to decide who benefits in trade agreements?

&gt;A united EU can counter the more unsavoury parts of American interest

You assume the EU is in any way united on what's best for the EU.

&gt;but for the most part we share common interests with the US, far more than the interests of say, China

What's with all the fucking China bashing the last few weeks around Reddit? Everything has been China this, China that, look at the evil Chinamen. You'd almost think that since Tianjin it's been the launch of a coordinated smear campaign. Our interests align just as much with China's as they do with the USA. Build economy, improve industry, provide jobs, reduce environmental impact (though yes, China is a little late to the game there), reduce national debt. There's literally no difference.

&gt; Trade deals are negotiated in secret so that other parties (namely multinational corporations and the press) don't influence

Except said corporations already have their chips on the table with the politicians doing the negotiating. So the only unrepresented people are the actual people.

&gt;Once a treaty has been agreed on, it will be submitted for the approval of the national parliaments concerned- that's when we decide wherever to approve the deal or not.

You expect the elected officials to look at what this means for their actual people and not how much hassle they could just remove by allowing megacorporations to sue other nations for loss of profit for passing laws that protect it's people? We already know that kind of bullshit clause is in the TPP and for that exact matter it should be rejected.

&gt;For this reason, I'm sceptical of the video's claim that corporations have been influencing these negotiations- that shouldn't be happening.

[Because the corporations and government haven't been having a steamy hot money orgy for the last 40 years?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_\(politics\))

Fact of the matter is, if they WANT to create this worldwide structure, why not announce it? Why not say outright hey, here's what we want to do, are you on board?

Aguero to kick on - Scored last week, but now an away ground. Want to seem him get a good run of form heading into the early October break before fixtures start to pile up.

Midfield two: Everton will stack the midfield, so Toure and Dinho have to be on top of their game, offensively and defensively. Winning headers, making crisp passes, and not getting caught out because Barkley will punish us.

Back-four form: I want Mangala to respond to Otamendi's addition by playing another wonderful match. Sagna and Kolarov get another chance to prove why they deserve their spots in the first XI.

Sterling: Let's get him scoring build some confidence. Navas might be tracking back a bit more this match to help out with Barkley, or whomever, so I'd expect the attack maybe to focus a bit more on the left. Hopefully Raheem gets on the ball and kills it.

Bench: If Bony and Delph get on, it would be wonderful for them to hit form. There's nothing better for a club than competition to push everyone on. ",null,0,null,1440341690,null,null,false,0,cucu2z3,null,t3_3i30tc,null,null,null,t3_3i30tc,null,null,null,1441421930,null,7,null,MCFC,t5_2s14k,7,null

null,null,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy",null,"&gt; What purpose does an air show actually serve?

This feels like a no brainer: because a lot of people like looking at aircraft. Same as car shows and boat shows. I went to Goodwood Festival of Speed this year and spent lots of time looking around various supercar paddocks. I'm not going to buy one of course, but it's nice to be able to get up close to them or see them racing round a track. 

Same with air shows. 

The maneuvers in this case are mostly to show off the aircraft from a variety of angles and to show what they're capable of. Sometimes the big bombers (Vulcan, Lancaster etc.) will fly over with bomb doors open, just so people can see the inner workings. 

&gt; how can the flight path be allowed to go anywhere near a main road/residential area when something like that is essentially quite dangerous?

Shoreham Airshow has been running successfully for *years* and the airfield itself has always existed in the same space (with flight paths over the A27 and a number of other busy roads in the area. There's also a school (Lancing College) in the background on the hill and a train line running just south of the airport). 

Consider there are major roads running near Farnborough (where there's also a globally popular airshow) and near major UK airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Birmingham etc.) - there's really not a lot to be done about it and this genuinely is a tragic accident and not something major changes should be made for.

Fabregas is getting better every game. His pass accuracy was a little off but he was constantly looking to play Costa and Pedro in behind. I dont think he can be fully blamed for a lack in his defensive discipline when every other play he has to go wide to help cover the increasingly lost Ivanovic. 

I think we saw today that Dave does have the ability to get forward. However as has been the case before, he struggles against true wingers who try to get to the end line and put in crosses. But we know he shies away from his left. 

Lastly, Pedro is good.

Do the CBT, then sort out a bike, and buy gear during the few days you have to wait while they get it ready for you. If you buy from a dealer they often throw in some free or discounted gear with a 125.

Each manufacturer tends to have their own barmy rules and they're rarely consistent, but the R tends to stand for Race (as in sporty looking), which might distinguish from the YZF125 which could be a naked bike.

Lloris, Kane, Eriksen, Chadli, Rose, Walker, Dembele, Vertonghen (had a bad start but still a good player), Toby, yet to see players like N'jie and possibly even Berahino. 

Stoke signing 1 or 2 flashy players doesn't all of sudden make them better teams then us. 

Mitchell's track record at southhampton speaks for itself. Let him embed his scouting infrastructure and go to work. Think about our team in the next five years not the next five months. 

Finally, this point may be difficult to understand ( not trying to sound like a dick) but when teams sign these individualistic players from the continents, over time, when managers leave and system changes, i think any club starts to lose a bit of soul. Like we did in that AVB/Sherwood season. I just felt no connection to the team. I didnt know what to expect. Now, even though we havent had an amazing start, im content with having Mason, Carrol, and Onomah in the squad. I feel like i connect with them and if poch trusts them , i do too.

Fine, *as long as I'm getting regular service*. That is to say - as long as you're not putting in a half arsed job serving me because I'm not doubling your hourly rate for you on top of already paying for my meal and your employment.

It's Waterproof stuff too so it's stuff that could be used year-round (Although, I've yet to ride in pouring rain so I'll see about that).

No doubt you could shop around and get stuff cheaper or more tailored to your own taste. 

Insurance unfortunately is something you'll have to figure out yourself; it varies too much on your circumstances like your bike, your location, situation (garaged, on street etc) and your desired options (Fully comp, TPFT, Excess, Additionals etc)
I pay around £500 p/y TPTF for my CBF.

I was fortunate that I already had a lot of maintenance stuff, but that's stuff you can get over time (or when you need it) 

As for your original question I'd go safety first and get the gear, so you can at least use it on your CBT; rather than borrow a smelly instructor helmet, get a CBT &amp; Bike and risk riding around at a time you're more likely to come off due to your inexperience and scrape skin that could have been saved by gear. 

Sit on some bikes and see what you think, see if you prefer a sports bike style, trial bike style, cruiser and so on. I did some shopping around and planted my bum on more than a few seats; unfortunately I had to bite the bullet and get a bike I could afford rather than what I desired. 

I'm probably going to get some hate for this, but at 125cc there's not a whole lot of difference between a YZF and a CBR and so on in performance when ridden by a newbie, realistically. The difference will come from the style of bike. My CBF may be seen as a commuter bike, but I've probably had as much fun on it as I would have a YZF. Then again I'm not racing people or trying to rule the roads, just trying to become a good rider and not fall off which for a first bike, is more important I think.",null,0,null,1440343506,null,null,false,0,cucux8j,null,t3_3i2q9v,null,null,null,t3_3i2q9v,null,null,null,1441422332,null,4,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,4,null

It's very easy to run a subnet with your own router and use the ISP provided one as the 'WAN' to your router, which then connects to the ISP network like it normally would. Even with ISP routers that don't offer modem only mode (like Sky) you can happily run everything on your home network through your own router and simply have your router connect to the ISP provided one to get internet.

I've been doing this for years and I'm writing this with that exact setup operating perfectly. 

All you need to do is have a router that can set it's subnet address. Virgin seems to be 192.168.0.1 by default (or 192.168.100.1 for moden only mode) and you just set your router to a different subnet like 192.168.2.1.

Turn off the wifi component of the ISP router and run wifi through your router.

If your router doesn't have auto WAN DCHP you might have to assign a static IP address to your router in the ISP one and then set the WAN IP address in your router as that IP assigned in the ISP router but apart from that it should just work. 

Other pitfalls can be the DNS service used but that rare. 

Why do this? I move a lot so don't have to change WIFI setups for family members and I have a router that can handle gigabit speeds comfortably, unlike routers like Sky which are (maybe still?) only capable of handling 100mbps and fall over when trying to stream internally (Plex/XBMC) and from the internet.

With decent firmware or a decent router you can also setup a VPN in your router itself so you can tunnel all your traffic from all your devices (including those that can't run a VPN themselves) through the VPN.",null,0,null,1440343859,null,null,false,0,cucv3i3,null,t3_3i2b15,null,null,null,t1_cucrdnt,null,null,null,1441422414,null,2,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

You then linked to the challenge 25 policy showing when someone will be asked for ID. 

Neither of these things shows a requirement to show ID. If you were always required to show ID there would be no challenge 25, there would be a blanket ID policy.

null,null,swug3,,Tory voter coming for your benefits,null,"&gt; That is only true if you're looking at the race through a telescope. There are both civil and uncivil people on all sides of political debate, and at times the uncivil ones ruin it for the rest of us. Those Corbyn supporters who are calling everyone to the right of Bevan a fascist are matched by those Blairites who are calling anyone to the left of Callaghan a Trot. Doesn't make any of it reasonable, but there's no moral high ground here.

Being right wing, I normally have to deal with Corbyn supporters, I can't speak for others, but I suspect you are right.

&gt; I don't buy your analysis about 2020. It's going to be more about (as ever) the state of the economy than about who said what 5 years ago. If China goes belly-up, she brings us along for the ride, and the Conservatives will find it very difficult to win. If, on the other hand, things are rosy, then your electoral prospects are rosy also.

In both the Conservatives will thrive- If China does go tits up, then with the help of the media, they can spin that it was a factor that they could not control (something Labour haven't been able to do). Also, if Jeremy Corbyn is leader in 2020, they can also say ""He wants to bring Britain back to the 1960's and 70s, in which Britain was at its lowest point in its history. 

That is then when they will need someone from the centre to bring over centre- centre right voters.

If the economy is fine, then Conservatives will say ""Carry on as usual as it has worked, why change to someone who's beliefs caused the winter of discontent"".

If you're going to say that those turning to indiscriminate violence is the same as mistakes made by the army which they will acknowledge through time then you're a lost cause. Also, I will gladly wear the poppy for ALL those that have died including pre-partition Irish men, and I will NOT decide to stop wearing it because of a few incidents where the army has acted wrong.

null,null,geronimon,capaldi,Capaldi,null,"Actually, that's the exact point of the episode. Characters are not made to be loved, characters are not made to be charming and nice all the time. This season tries to bring you a thing that is problematic to you, because it turns you into the murderer as showing your real nature.

The Doctor, even with good intention, does what eir people and ey should do in this case. Ey lets things carry on. For once, ey lets humanity make eir own decisions and pushes aside eir love for humans to actually protect the species that is in most need. From eir point of view, the Doctor actually does the most correct and kindest thing.

But from Clara's point of view, this Doctor's decision is tough and enfuriates her. This gives you the opportunity of seeing both faces of a same coin, it's brilliant. The Doctor thinks that pleases Clara, but ey's actually so so wrong. Even though, ey *still* thinks ey's made the correct thing, ey's not changing eir mind about it either because eir personality is just not like that. 

Meanwhile, Clara has a breakdown. She does what any human would be expected to do. Apparently abandoned by her best friend in the middle of this terrible emergency, she's pushed to make an important decision. Unlike Amy, in the Silurian two-parter, we see the most real response in Clara. Clara tries to ask for second thoughts just to find the Earth making a natural mistake. But she still chooses not to kill it in the very last second, which is finally what breaks her.

Having the weight of potential deaths on her shoulders makes her so angry against the Doctor. The Doctor welcomes her with open hands, thinking everything is fine and the day is saved again, but doesn't expect Clara to react like this. Because ey trusts her and this is basically what ey lives on a day-to-day basis, ey doesn't predict that, for Clara, this would be much much harder. For first time, we see em not understanding the friend's point of view, and that's awesome character development. True quality.

And that's not the only brilliant thing about the episode, really. Kill of the Moon has a lot of character experimentation that really compensates the worst and weaker parts.

null,null,powatom,null,null,null,"&gt; You are misrepresenting my position.

You're misrepresenting Corbyn's position.

&gt; How is that his job? He is not in government. He is not a peace negotiator. He has voluntarily allied himself to the pro-palestine movement. Fine. But he has gone further, and supported the worst, most anti-semitic &amp; hateful sections of the pro-palestine campaign. 

It may not be his job, but people are entitled to care about things and to promote views and beliefs, are they not? Unless JC has actually stated that he wants to see the destruction of Israel or Jews, I'm not really sure what the fuss is about. As for supporting the worst, most anti-semitic &amp; hateful sections of the pro-palestine campaign - I suppose we just disagree on what 'support' looks like. The UK supports Israel financially and militarily. Anyone with half an ounce of brains could twist this into the UK supporting the wholesale slaughter of Palestinians, but *that would clearly be a ridiculous assertion to make*, because the issue is far more complex than that.

&gt; Additionally, he has made no attempt to talk to radical Israelis or radical Ulster Unionists.

Perhaps, you'd have to ask JC whether he's actually ever tried meeting those people. What I will say, however, is that there is not exactly a shortage of support for Israel, whether we're talking about it's simple right to exist, or whether you want to go further and claim that it also has the right to expand and settle. Very few people bother to engage with the other side however, which does not help the greater situation. We can't just pretend that there is no structure to the opposition against Israel - that there is nobody with any sway or influence, or that talking is utterly useless. We must open dialogue, and we must pursue dialogue over war wherever possible.

&gt; I am not asking him to denounce anyone. I am simply pointing out that he has actively supported anti-semites. It is not a high bar to request that the leader of a political party doesn't invite avowed, out-and-out anti-semites for tea at the HoC or write in support of them or donate to them.

&gt; Do you think DYR is a good cause? Eisen has been an obvious anti-semite for some time. Take a look at the DYR blog (basically wall-to-wall holocaust denial) http://blog.deiryassin.org/. Do you think it's a good cause? Do you do any due diligence on the organisations you donate to?

As far as I'm aware, the extent of Corbyn's donations to DYR extend to him dropping some money in a bucket for a memorial fund. I may be wrong, but that hardly sounds like the actions of somebody who actively supports holocasut deniers. I've dropped money into church collection buckets. Do I support the institutional rape of children? It's been a long time since I went to a church for anything other than a wedding, a christening, or a funeral - but I can recognise that there is both good and bad, and that we cannot simply state that the world is black and white and that giving a memorial fund money is akin to the tacit support of the opinions of the organisers.

&gt; How interesting. Unfortunately his distaste of anti-semitism hasn't extended to him you know, not donating to anti-semitic causes, but I suppose he's at least going through the emotions...

DYR is not presented as an anti-semitic *cause*, it is presented as a memorial fund. JC has been pretty open with his relationship with DYR and Eisen (what little 'relationship' there actually is): http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/142511/corbyn-quizzed-antisemitic-ties 

Whether you wish to see a donation to DYR as support of holocaust denial is your own decision to make, but I don't believe that dropping some money in a bucket to support the victims of displacement and death, represents support of a loosely related, abhorrent, historically ignorant opinion.

&gt; I know. I'm saying that if JC had just appeared with Hamas, or just appeared on the same platform as people from DYR, that would be more OK. But JC has gone further than that, he has donated to, written in support of and invited anti-semites to tea.

I guess we just see different things. JC is a politician, and politicians must talk to people. They must also at least *appear* to care about things that the electorate care about. Whether JC *actually* cares or not, only he knows - but he gives the impression to me that he cares more about ordinary people who are suffering at the hands of political machinations than he does about appeasing one particular side for fear of being called an anti-semite. Very few people with access to any kind of information on groups like Hamas or Hezbollah would deny that they are, at their core, motivated by irrational and abhorrent beliefs. They are, however, organisations that have influence, power, control and (to some degree) the means to enact change. Not talking to them will do nothing. I am happy to have a conversation about simply wiping out such groups, but this is unrealistic and would cause more problems than it solves. In such a situation, what are we to do? Talk or not talk? Treat them as we would want to be treated, or no?

HTV covered both Wales and the west of England.

They surely would have done the same thing to Scotland if that was the case anyway.)

Nowadays we're stuck with what is essentially ITV England, and there's apparently about 4 hours of local Welsh programming a *week*, most which is the news. 

Really if there's one part of broadcasting that should be devolved it's the ITV franchise, if the UK government has no plans to put the Welsh franchise out to tender then perhaps it should be the Welsh government that's in charge of it.

null,null,aeisenst,num5,,null,"[This](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=8gy1s) is my crazy idea. On the attack, the fullbacks would bomb forward and provide width. Kane drops back into attacking midfield, while Berahino pushes the line. Eriksen sits in the hole. Since both of our fullbacks are joining the attack, Dier drops back into a three man defensive line, pushed nice and high. The CMs can join the attack, or generally disrupt the midfield if the ball is turned over. This way, we have width from the fullbacks, speed from Berahino on the line, strength from Kane dropped into the attacking midfield, and creativity from Eriksen, while keeping a strong defense with the three man back and a high press from the two CMs.

Our problems are not in defence, but in midfield. Matic has been getting outplayed all night, instead of standing tall he chases the players and lets the player slip through (which is uncharacteristic of him...)

Him and Fabregas used to alternate going up, but now they're both up the field with no one to stay back and defend or close any counter attacks. I think Matic is getting a bit too ambitious.

Willian's finishing is atrocious (it's never been good... but I mean yea), Costa too - they both missed EXCELLENT opportunities.

For me Hazard has been a huge disappointment, very very slow on the ball, stops the game VERY often (isn't this why we kicked Mata out of the team...)

Pedro is a gift, thank God we let him start &lt;3 (he carried us very hard today, even defended very well)

Zouma and Terry seemed fine, Azpi was a bit off letting that McMan guy behind him way too often and Ivanovic was better than last game, but really disappointing... Always getting the wrong side of the defenders...


If there is anything positive - we did fairly well on capitalizing on West Brom's errors (we should have done better really, but at least we did something with some chances). However, our link up is TERRIBLE at the moment. I didn't see a decent one touch play all game.

I've been on UC for a few weeks now. Still waiting on the confirmation letter but I have been to see my 'job coach' a few times already and already I've had problems.

First I received a letter from UC saying my claim application had a problem. It didn't bother explaining what the problem was, just that there was a problem and I needed to call. So I called up and was told the letter was just the system flagging it up automatically and I can ignore it since they didn't need the extra information at all.

Another problem I have is that now my job coach isn't my first point of contact for anything involving my claim, including appointment times or the financial side of it. I understand it now just about but to begin with I struggled with figuring out who was responsible for what.

Oh, and another nice little thing is the sanctions. My job coach hates it as well since she now has to constantly remind me about them every time we put something into the system. It's not subtle either, a huge warning box pops up on the screen and she physically cannot continue using the system without giving me the warning.

I'll end on some advice for those also on UC and who is struggling with meeting 35 hours of job searching - which I find a bit stupid honestly but it's something I sort of understand - and that advice is do volunteer work.

null,null,notaukrainian,null,null,null,"How am I misrepresenting Corbyn’s position? He says that he is not an anti-semite. I agree. 

“It may not be his job, but people are entitled to care about things and to promote views and beliefs, are they not? “

You initially defended Corbyn by saying that it was part of his job to associate with anti-semites, which I disagreed with.

“Unless JC has actually stated that he wants to see the destruction of Israel or Jews, I'm not really sure what the fuss is about”

JC is close to both Hamas &amp; Hezbollah. Hamas wants every Jew in the world to die. Now, I don’t think Corbyn wants that but he has to be aware that associating with these people, calling them his friends, saying that the UK govt. made a mistake by classifying them as terrorist organisations is going to reflect on him badly.

Is the only way to draw your ire to actually state things – if a Tory politician donated to a rabid anti-Islam organisation, would you give them a free pass as long as they didn’t openly say they were Islamophobic?

“ As for supporting the worst, most anti-semitic &amp; hateful sections of the pro-palestine campaign - I suppose we just disagree on what 'support' looks like. The UK supports Israel financially and militarily. Anyone with half an ounce of brains could twist this into the UK supporting the wholesale slaughter of Palestinians, but that would clearly be a ridiculous assertion to make, because the issue is far more complex than that.”

Well I personally don’t think the UK should fund Israel to the extent that we do, I think that Israel has repellent policies and has the blood of many Palestinians on its hands. That being said, Israel does not have a constitution that specifically says its mission is to kill all Palestinians. Hamas does (re: Jews). So the UK can say, in all honesty, that we are supporting a country defending itself against attack. 

When Jeremy hosts &amp; supports Hamas, he is directly supporting (financially &amp; in terms of exposure) a group that wants to kill all Jews in the world. These people do not hide their anti-semitism.

“We must open dialogue, and we must pursue dialogue over war wherever possible.”

Let’s take the view that JC has only ever talked with Hamas for the cause of world peace. Really, he hates their views on Israel. In that case why does he write in support of Stephen Sizer, Raed Salah, Dyab About Jahjah et al? These people hold no political power and are in no way connected to the peace process.

“As far as I'm aware, the extent of Corbyn's donations to DYR extend to him dropping some money in a bucket for a memorial fund. I may be wrong, but that hardly sounds like the actions of somebody who actively supports holocasut deniers. I've dropped money into church collection buckets. Do I support the institutional rape of children? It's been a long time since I went to a church for anything other than a wedding, a christening, or a funeral - but I can recognise that there is both good and bad, and that we cannot simply state that the world is black and white and that giving a memorial fund money is akin to the tacit support of the opinions of the organisers.”

So he says. Paul Eisen says a chequebook was involved.
Please don’t be so disingenuous. What good has DYR done, exactly? The core purpose of DYR is to spread holocaust denialism. The core purpose of the Church is very different!

“Whether you wish to see a donation to DYR as support of holocaust denial is your own decision to make, but I don't believe that dropping some money in a bucket to support the victims of displacement and death, represents support of a loosely related, abhorrent, historically ignorant opinion.”

I think that yes, giving money to an organisation openly promoting holocaust denialism is supporting holocaust denialism. Not sure how it could be spun in any other way – given that actually helping people very much seems to take a backseat to the promotion of holocaust denialism.",null,0,null,1440347544,null,null,false,0,cucwxrp,null,t3_3hyxcc,null,null,null,t1_cucvpbh,null,null,null,1441423282,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I mean he's flawed wherever he plays but ultimately the only thing he's really good at is keeping the ball, and central midfield is an ideal place for that sort of player. His best season at Fulham was in central midfield surging forward in transition, and he played similarly for us in his first year.

They are very different, with different expectations of behavior, different rules, and different regulators. Newspapers are basically free to say whatever they want (and the Tories were heavily against Labour's plans to clamp down on their freedom, and since they won the election, that won't be happening anytime soon) hence there is a broad range of newspapers across the spectrum which are overtly political in tone and very biased in one direction (and the readers know and expect this).

Television news coverage is regulated by Ofcom and is supposed to be impartial. Say what you want about Murdoch, or Kay Burley being horrible, but politically it's hard to find bias on Sky News any more than you could argue it exists on the BBC, especially when you compare what's actually possible for Murdoch to come up with in countries where television impartiality rules don't exist (i.e. Fox News in the US). On the other hand, Press.tv was outrageously partisan and quite clearly not even slightly impartial, and after many warnings deserved to have their licence taken away from them.

That's the difference. Some like newspapers because they're free, some like television news because the rules say it must be impartial. Choose whichever you like, or pick a bit from both.

Well that's easy to say. Everything I'm saying here I'm backing up with an argument, so if we could focus on the actual discussion instead of random insultations of bias. How about actually saying something that maybe I only believe because of bias? Didn't I say I don't think the UVF and UDA are terrorists either? Where is my bias there?


&gt; 2167 deaths were caused by Republicans, 1115 by loyalists and 362 by security forces


I'm not saying the Republicans weren't more active, just that almost all of their activity was against the British army, not targeting civilians, yet you would have it understood the IRA attacking civilians was the principle aim? Yes the IRA were very active (one could say the higher death toll was because the IRA were much better at war than the British army) but as the British army were a violent, engaging part of the conflict, how can attacking them be considered terrorism? More so I feel my point about completely disregarding this ""British army were part of the state"" argument was valid, and you haven't responded, so the issue of the British army being terrorists seems to still be in the air, and I've already said if you consider the British army terrorists then I have no problem with you considering the IRA terrorists. I don't think either were, but that view is perfectly valid.


&gt; that there would be zero collateral damage


That's it again. How many of the civilians killed by the IRA were killed during attacks on Crown forces? That's more bias that that is terrorism, but British army forces doing it is 'collateral damage' not terrorism.


&gt; If you're going to say that those turning to indiscriminate violence


Why do you keep trying to make it sound like all it was was the British army stepping out of line now and again. ""Mistakes"" they literally fired live ammunition at unarmed, innocent civilians. Deliberately. Stop trying to cover that. It happened. 



&gt; Also, I will gladly wear the poppy for ALL those that have died including pre-partition Irish men, and I will NOT decide to stop wearing it because of a few incidents where the army has acted wrong. Are you a paradigm of perfection that never makes a mistake? Nor is anyone.


Yes? That's what I've been saying this whole time? I support the IRA despite the few events when the IRA attacked civilians. Irregular events shouldn't impact the whole thing right? So I commemorate the IRA without commemorating the Omagh bombers etc, as a whole they weren't terrorists. But if someone said your support of the British army was supporting terrorism, because look these guys shot civilians in 1972 you would laugh. That's clearly not what the poppy represents (to you).

null,null,wessexboyofsidney,SidneySussex,Sidney Sussex,null,"I'd go along with /u/thenumber0. It's important to realise there is no sure fire way to bag a place in Cambridge; the admissions process is difficult and imperfect, and there are more people with perfect A Level grades than there are places in Oxbridge. I know a guy who got rejected from Oxbridge with 4A*s.

Ultimately I'd say you should go to 6th form where you will be most comfortable, but I agree with /u/thenumber0 that it seems silly not to take extra support where possible, the interview is a vital part of admissions and practice for that can be handy. I was rejected from Oxbridge twice before getting in third time, and I think the experience of having done (albeit unsuccessful) interviews before helped me to be relaxed and to think straight in the one that worked.

If you're talking about choosing a Cambridge College, choice of college makes absolutely zero difference to your chances of getting in. The Cambridge Pooling system is excellent and will ensure that if you're good enough but your college was oversubscribed, another college will pick you up. A huge proportion of Cantabs (Cambridge students) were pooled, so don't choose your college based on trying to game the system. Visit and choose your favourite!

If you're talking about choosing a 6th Form college (which on rereading your post is probably what you meant, sorry!), again I agree with /u/thenumber0 that Cambridge does account for background, but imagine being an admissions tutor, trying to decide the perfect amount of leeway to give a student who might have done better in a different school, and trying to judge this correctly for everyone who applies; it's an impossible job to do perfectly. It seems safer just to go the better school if you really have that choice.

You say going to a further school would reduce your study time a lot, but how would it really?

Finally it is worth asking a very basic question. Are these two schools of similar size? I mean it makes more sense to think in terms of % of students in a school going to Oxbridge rather than in pure numbers. If Symonds is ten times bigger (I understand this is unlikely) then it is no better than Alton.

Anyway, do ask any further questions you think of. Good luck! And also presumably congrats on the GCSEs :P

This season we've been weakened in midfield by selling Capoue, Stambouli, Paulinho etc (I expect at least one of them to be replaced with a DM signing, and Alli looks promising) but strengthened in defence by signing Trippier, Wimmer and Toby. Up front we've only got Kane and N'jie, who is unproven. Hopefully we'll also bring in Berahino. 

I think that we have a good, solid squad. I think we're missing a lot of quality needed to win matches, particularly against the top teams, and I think other teams seem to have strengthened in those areas. 

I don't find your point hard to understand (I've been a Spurs fan for 30 years) and I'd say that it's great to have young players coming through but ultimately I'm interested in a player's quality and character, rather than their postcode. Every club has young players coming through and every fan loves to see young, homegrown players, but the reason so few of them make it is because ultimately they aren't good enough.

You can say the same for any airport that is near a major road or a residential area. See BA Flight 38 or the Kegworth crash. No one on the ground was killed or injured in those crashes but they both had the potential to be a lot more devastating. Imagine if the BA flight had crashed into the A30 or any of the built up areas in Hatton Cross. Imagine if the BMI flight had crashed onto the M1 instead of the embankment. [Look](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/G-OBME_Aerial_photograph_of_site_%28AAIB%29.jpg) how close it was to the M1.

Three matches in, but Managala/Kompany has been the best CB pairing in the league thus far and they both look world class. I like the addition of Otamendi, but he’ll have to be amazing to get into the XI. They’ve taken on Costa and Lukaku and shut them down with rarely a problem. 

Navas has been much better this year, but his finishing is the reason why KdB is practically necessary in this squad. Sterling’s finishing will come along, but City need another threat from goal and KdB offers it more than Jesus. 

Nasri also showed why he still warrants a spot in the team and is integral. There will be slow matches where somehow, City need to create a goal out of nothing, and he offers that ability. He’s the best replacement City have for Silva as of now, too. 

Kolarov and Sagna likely won’t come out of the side, as long as they continue to perform well. 

Injuries and rotation will come, but for now, this is some of the best football the squad has played since the purchase. City are title favorite, and maybe a lot more.

I'm mostly concerned about the attack. Pellè does a lot of work with very little reward. His shots to goal ratio is incredibly poor, if not the worst in the division. I can't see it happening, but I really think Reed needs to be looking at bringing in a new goal threat. I'm not at all convinced about Rodriguez. He's had very little impact since returning and we can't really afford the time it'll take for him to adapt and be match fit. Mané is too inconsistent and Long doesn't really score, although does contribute well.   

We need our version of Gomis/Lukaku. A strong attacker with an eye for goal that Pellè just doesn't have consistently enough.  

We'll be fine. It's going to be a long old season but we'll find our stride.

null,null,powatom,null,null,null,"&gt; How am I misrepresenting Corbyn’s position? He says that he is not an anti-semite. I agree.

Then what are you arguing? It sounds rather like you're willing to insinuate Corbyn's position, but you're not willing to outright state it. If you agree that he's not an anti-semite, then why is there any question over him speaking to people who either are outspoken anti-semites or 'secret' anti-semites? If he's not an anti-semite, then isn't engagement with those people what we actually want? Somebody who disagrees with their assumptions but nevertheless wishes to open a dialogue about moving forward rather than endlessly kill each other?

&gt; JC is close to both Hamas &amp; Hezbollah. Hamas wants every Jew in the world to die. Now, I don’t think Corbyn wants that but he has to be aware that associating with these people, calling them his friends, saying that the UK govt. made a mistake by classifying them as terrorist organisations is going to reflect on him badly.

It only reflects on him badly because people keep saying that it reflects on him badly. JC has already discussed his use of the word 'friends' - we either take him on his word or we don't. We don't have to ask *why* he did it however. You either believe him (in which case it's a non-issue) or you think there's more to the story. Which is it?

&gt; Let’s take the view that JC has only ever talked with Hamas for the cause of world peace. Really, he hates their views on Israel. In that case why does he write in support of Stephen Sizer, Raed Salah, Dyab About Jahjah et al? These people hold no political power and are in no way connected to the peace process.

Perhaps he believes that simply refusing to allow discussion of certain topics results in a chilling effect which ultimately means that those with power dictate the questions that are allowed to be asked. In each of those cases, the problem results from the conflation of anti-semitism, holocaust denial, and anti-zionism. People with horrendous views on Jewish people are still allowed to question Zionism and the actions of Israel, just as everybody else is. If one were to question zionism and even go so far as to want to protest zionism, then it stands to reason that this would ultimately mean that you ended up rubbing shoulders with anti-semites. The two positions are not necessarily related, but they do often come together. As far as I can recall (although I don't have any specific articles to hand), JC has made statements about these instances - and in all cases his position seems to be that either he does not agree with anti-semitism, or that anti-zionism is not the same thing as anti-semitism. I'm not really sure what position you expect him to take. What should he say or do? He is free to speak his mind, and I don't find his words or actions particularly incriminating or offensive. What is it about him that you find so troubling, if you don't believe he is an anti-semite or a holocaust denier?

&gt; So he says. Paul Eisen says a chequebook was involved. 

So it's one word against the other. What makes you the judge? Let's see the evidence.

&gt; What good has DYR done, exactly? The core purpose of DYR is to spread holocaust denialism. The core purpose of the Church is very different!

Why is it my job to validate the work of DYR? I've never donated to them - I'm simply saying that they do not present themselves as a holocaust denial platform. If their job was to promote holocaust denialism, why wouldn't it simply be their stated goal? Why would JC know any more than any other lay-man when asked to drop money in a bucket? I'm not saying that it is impossible that JC is lying to us, but it is not helpful to act as though he **is** lying without any evidence to support that. JC has addressed all of these 'issues' - what is it that you want him to do?

&gt; I think that yes, giving money to an organisation openly promoting holocaust denialism is supporting holocaust denialism. 

Not if you are unaware that promoting holocaust denialism is the core purpose of an organisation which claims to be a memorial fund for the victims of a massacre and mass displacement. What would you have done, in the same situation, with the same knowledge that JC had at the time?

Honestly, all of these attempts to paint JC as some kind of terrorist sympathiser don't make any sense. He's addressed everything that has been asked of him - not always satisfactorily, maybe - but I'm not really sure what repeating the same questions endlessly is going to achieve except to muddy the waters and make it more difficult to have a fair leadership election. If you don't believe JC, then that's up to you - but asking questions which have already been answered does nothing but suggest that there are still questions which need answering.

The good was that we weren't really overpowered by City's attack. The goals were due to a combination of silly errors and exceptional skill. Against any other team, I think we'd have a clean sheet. Coleman was fantastic, and looks like he's getting back to his 13/14 form. Howard also looks better than he did last season, although the first goal is on him.

The bad - although we threatened a bit, we couldn't get a shot off. Very disappointing considering the number of times we found ourselves in promising position. Lukaku pondered on the ball too much, but he also didn't get the support he needed from Barkley (who I didn't think was too bad except for his final balls).  Browning unfortunately looked out of his depth, but I'm not too worried in the long term. It was a bit of a harsh match to judge him by, and he wasn't exactly horrendous. Deulofeu's touch was horrendous at the end. We need to start him against a lower-mid table club for him to find his feet, I think.

The noise it makes is still going to be tremendous compared to stock, and you should get less hassle (its still loud, baffle does very little if you choose to use it).

When I rang my insurance company, Hastings Direct, I rang them 4 times and got 4 different answers. But the most sensible answer I got was that they don't cover exhausts over £500, and that they don't cover it if it increases performance. I told them that the Delkevic is purely cosmetic, 2bhp is negligible and should fit within a margin of error for the stock bhp output of your bike. Your bike will lose bhp as it ages, unless you take tremendous care of it (although not by much). This margin for error should also count for the 47bhp rule, but I don't know how strict they are.

MOT inspection may cause issues if you are running illegal pipes, the inspector may give you an advisory or fail you entirely, depends on the inspector. Police can stop you and tell you to prove that the bike and its parts are all legal. I'm not entirely sure what the process is, but you may have to produce paperwork etc at the local police station (don't quote me on that).

I know nothing about the tail lights, sorry. However, as with the pipes, if they aren't road legal the MOT inspection or Police may give you an advisory for it or worse. YMMV.

My advice, if you really want a smaller can, go for the 350, take the baffle out, put it back in for MOT time. But if you really must buy the smallest loudest pipe you can, wear ear plugs, and put the stock pipe back on for MOT.

Unfortunately there were both errors, and we didn't get the luck we needed. It could have been a different game if Lukaku wasn't given offside, and if his freekick was a ball length lower- but as I say, the lucky breaks didn't come.

I don't understand the criticism of Lukaku. He worked hard, and showed a good linkup with Barkley once again. Strikers are not going to score every game, but Lukaku showed that he is not just a one trick pony today with some half decent work with his back to goal, and a decent attacking of space. He hustled both Kompany and Mangala, who are a world class defensive partnership, and he actually got some joy in positions he had no right to. Something very few are capable of. 

I think we did well breaking up play.

The US is a minor on the political world stage, a mere child when it comes to international politics and their heavy handed approach for the last 150 years has been the cause of nearly every destabilisation in another country across the globe. Let's not forget this is the country that removed people from office they didn't like in OTHER COUNTRIES via the CIA and installed their own sympathetic leaders. You expect them to play fair if allowed to decide who benefits in trade agreements?

Like it or not, we have benefited from passing the baton of world superpower status to America- they ensure that the NATO alliance is viable and for the most part tries to promote democracy, free trade and human rights like we do. They bugger up occasionally, which is why I think a strong, united EU that can counter America were necessary would be desirable (i'm not saying the EU is united, just that it ought to be). Still, I'd rather have a nation that espouses liberal values shaping global politics than a nation that doesn't. 

&gt;What's with all the fucking China bashing

I haven't seen any of that ?

&gt;Except said corporations already have their chips on the table with the politicians doing the negotiating. So the only unrepresented people are the actual people.

That's not the same as actually having corporations sat round the negotiating table though. You could say politicians have a vested interest to work a deal that would suit the major corporations which I'm willing to concede as a valid point, but they have a bigger vested interest in making a deal that would get them re-elected, that's how democracy works.

&gt;you expect the elected officials to look at what this means for their actual people and not how much hassle they could just remove by allowing megacorporations to sue other nations for loss of profit for passing laws that protect it's people? We already know that kind of bullshit clause is in the TPP and for that exact matter it should be rejected.

Go and read /r/tradeissues, in particular the content written by /u/savannahJeff, i'm not convinced that these free trade deals will threaten national sovereignty.

It was like we reverted back to last season today with just lazy defending and poor passing throughout. Once again Cleverley was fantastic but he is being played out of position and he's not exactly getting the players to move for him all he can do it loft it up to Lukaku or play it around most times. Barkley looked like a good threat as well, looked like scoring a few times really impressed with him so far this year compared to last. Coleman was good as well looking like he's recapturing his form. 

Now onto the negatives. Howard was poor enough for the two goals especially the first but to be fair he had a great game otherwise, was really thinking he was going to get back on track the way he's been playing but he's always had a mistake in him and it's so frustrating when it comes. We were fucked all day on our left side with Galloway and Browning playing. I thought Galloway done reasonably ok when you take into account his experience and who he was up against but Browning was much worse. Seemed like he didn't know what to do most of the time which I guess makes sense seeing as he was playing out of position completely. Was Jags playing there for a bit after he came on too? Thought McCarthy and Barry didn't do too well either. They both made a few mistakes but played ok in segments. Rom was bad as well as I said seemed like he reverted back to last year with his touch and passing. Kone was meh really. 

The worst thing that happened in my opinion was the Naismith sub. I mean no offence to the lad but he's shit. And not even the Kone level of shit where Kones alright at times but he's generally not up to our standard but Naismith is much worse. I can't think of the last time I've seen him properly impact a game positively like Kone did against Watford. I mean what sense does Roberto see when arguably our two best attacking threats are on the bench in Deulofeu and Mirallas yet Naismith comes on? Baffles me really the man is a poverty player and I wish we'd sell him because in all honesty he's totally unnecessary for the squad especially if we get Yarmolenko. 

I was expecting a loss or a draw today to be honest so I'm not really that annoyed over it but I'd have still liked to get some points. Hopefully Galloway isn't too badly injured and maybe we'll try Mori at left back or 3 at the back now that he's virtually signed for next week.

As far as I could see in that match, Fonte was our only real defender. As expected he was a reliable rock for us, making tackles where others don't. I was also pleased with Cedric's performance as he was making some good attacking runs down the wing, but also getting back to make some good tackles. Targett on the other hand, was struggling in defence, he was showing off some nice skills down the other end of the pitch, but his side was particularly weak defensively. Yoshida and Caulker I thought played OK, but nothing of particular note to make them stand out.

In the midfield Romeu seemed to be making a good impression on me now he has had time to train with the squad. He is obviously not Schneiderlin standard (yet) but he didn't play appalingly. Wanyama on the other hand really shouldn't try to go forward much, his shots were just wasting possession, and his passing was not up to scratch. I know he isn't exactly a playmaker, but he just didn't like he was putting much effort into the match. Davis was also particularly unimpressive. He likes giving away fouls, and doing bad free kicks. After JWPs performance against the Danish team (I'm not going to look up how to spell it) I would start him over Davis any day. His delivery's are far superior, his passing is normally much better, and he doesn't try and get booked at every opportunity.

Unfortunately I missed the first 20 minutes, so I can't comment on how Mané was playing, although Shane Long wasn't doing a terrible job supporting the attack. His first touch was letting him down from what I could see, although when he got to a header, he was looking very dangerous. Pellé wasn't given as many opportunities as he should be, although he really messed up his shot after chesting the ball down late on in the game. In his defense it was on the turn, but he should be able to at least pull the keeper into some kind of save. He had the odd attempt that he maybe could have done better with, but I don't think it was so much his fault with the outcome of the game, as the rest of the players needed to give him more chances. Jay Rod still doesn't look match ready to me. He was good in pre-season, but, that was pre-season. He needs a bit more work away from BPL matches before he will be up to standard.

People will say someone like Burnham or Cooper won't win because they don't appeal to the public. But no evidence suggests that's true at all. All our leaders are these obvious politician types. Whoever wins the Labour leadership will be second favourite to George Osborne, hardly the man of the people that people seem to think the public will flock too. 

I can see why people like Corbyn but as a politician, he's simply unelectable. You get people saying Labour won't win anyway under the other leaders but these same people's logic also suggests that Cameron or Osborne would be unelectable.

Someone like Corbyn would be great for a fringe party, like Farage is for UKIP,  they've a dedicated fanbase and appeal to them strongly.

You need to reread what i wrote it would cost the state less not more, the problem is a lack of cheap family homes, if you let people who don't need them take up family sized social housing you need to put up a family in private accommodation 

Renting a 2 bedroom privately and a 4 bedroom council house, is cheaper than renting a 4 bedroom family house privately and a 4 bedroom council house, so family's should get the cheaper social housing couples and singles should be in private accommodation.

&gt;but I think people should be able to live as a family unit without taking in strangers from the street, don't you?

Its nice but not if it means someone has to be homeless, i know family's not on benefits who take in lodgers to make ends meet, its not a big deal, if your getting a free house as well i imagine most would say that was a pretty good deal, plus it means we can get more people off waiting lists an into housing.

Thursday 15th - Sunday 18th of October [Mayhem Film Festival ](http://www.experiencenottinghamshire.com/whats-on/mayhem-film-festival-p574841)

 Now in its 11th year, Mayhem Film Festival has grown from a single short film programme to a four-day event, offering the best horror, sci-fi and cult short and feature films from around the world.

Over the years, Mayhem has welcome numerous filmmakers such as Canada’s cult heroes Astron-6 and hosted exceptional events such as masterclasses with Gareth Edwards (Monsters, Godzilla) and Mike Hodges (Get Carter, Black Rainbow), specially-commissioned live scores from 8MM Orchestra, and a screening of Don’t Look Now at St Mary’s Church with British Director Nicolas Roeg.
 
This year, Mayhem Film Festival moves away from its traditional Halloween slot to reflect its much broader programme. Originally created as a horror film festival, Mayhem has expanded its horizons, looking at the darker side of sci-fi and cult cinema and television, whilst keeping its core horror focus. Last year, Mayhem also hosted Teen Mayhem, a day of events dedicated to pre-teens and young teenagers with a curiosity for the genre.

I don't think waiters are better than anyone, and perhaps that assumption you've made is part of your disagreement.

&gt;Way I see it is if you want more money get a better paid job. Don't expect your customer's to supplement your pay check because your employer doesn't value you above minimum wage.

Or if you hate that waiters get tips and you don't, be a waiter...? It's easier and better paid according to you. Go for it! Also, this argument is moot, simply because I left the service industry about a year ago. You know what's changed in the industry? Nothing. Another person will fill my shoes and tell you exactly the same. It's not my own individual problem, it's a problem within the culture of service.

I will hold my hands up and say I HOPE I haven't explicitly said I EXPECT customers to pay up. It's completely optional! If you don't want to tip don't do it, but don't belittle the work done in the service industry. I don't like it when I see waiters ASSUME that tips are mandatory, or that they can get away with treating people like crap and then get mad that they didn't get a tip because it makes us all look bad, and breeds the kind of perspective shared in this very thread. In fact, I hate those waiters more than I dislike hearing people undervalue and underrate the work service industry people do, because they simply reinforce it all.

Sure you could have an easy ride but earn potatoes, or you could take it seriously, learn the art and earn a hell of a lot more. I've arguably earned more money in a year as a waiter than I have in any of my recent ""proper jobs"", because I did more than smile and carry food. I took pride in my work, and always will.

Y Ddraig Goch has often been seen as a symbol of Wales dating back as far as Roman times, but as he pointed out this is the dragon of Cadwaladr. Yet, he doesn't talk about any of the symbolism behind it. It harks back to the 10th Century poem Armes Prydein (roughly meaning the Prophecy of Britain) where it is claimed that Cadwaladr would return from the dead to help lead the Welsh to victory over the Saxons and to claim there rightful place, as they would have seen it, as overlords of Britain. Henry using the symbol of Cadwaladr would have inspired people as every Welshman would have been aware of the propchecy at the time.

It was said in Armes Prydein that Y Mab Darogan (The Son of Prophecy) would lead the Welsh to victory in battle, and Henry was keen to make the Welsh *know* that he was none other than the prophesised son so they would be more likely to join him. This was not limited to flags as he sponsered a number of Wales' top poets to write poems describing him as Y Mab Darogan.

Furthemore, he correctly says that green and white are the Tudor colours, but he neglects to mention the history behind that either. Green and white were the ""battle colours"" of Wales (specifically Gwynedd - where the Tudors came from), as it was common for Welshmen to wear those colours whenever they went to war. The first recorded mention of these colours was in a 12th Century poem, although the name escapes me. Nevertheless, there is also a record of Welsh archers wearing these colours at the battle of Crécy, 200 years before Bosworth.

To turn the attention to Baner Dewi Sant he completley neglects to mention that the flag was a [20th Century invention](http://nathenamin.com/2011/11/08/history-of-welsh-flags/), based off two colours which were often associated with David.

null,null,JohnMulroy,num20,,null,"This article by Windy puts the transfers into context. Here is the most relevant part

""In an ideal world, Mitchell and Mackenzie would have come up with a list of fantastic young players who are all under the radar, gettable for £5m (with no competition), and will be big hits straight away. The reality is that the pool of strikers able to improve a top 5/6 team in one of the best leagues in the world is really quite a small pool.

For every Wilfried Bony and Dimitar Berbatov there’s an Emmanuel Rivière or Roberto Soldado. I imagine we’ve started off enquiring for strikers that aren’t attainable and have moved down the list as the window as progressed, ending with Saido Berahino and possibly even with Charlie Austin (ugh). If we can’t get the players that we want, we move on to the next on the list, but time has passed. And if we can’t get that one? We move on to the next, but more time has passed still.

Fans ask why we didn’t sign Berahino in the first week of the transfer window for £25m. Assuming that he was at the top of our list (and let’s face it, that seems unlikely) there are two practical issues there.

West Bromwich Albion will drag their heels – just like we did with Gareth Bale – in the hope that we get fed up and look elsewhere.
They want £25m, which is arguably about £5m-10m too much.
If it was just a case of stumping up another £1m or so to get a deal done, do you not think Levy would do it? I absolutely do. It’s clearly not that simple – so do we just take a £10m hit and pay £25m?

There are reasons why that would be a bad idea. Firstly, because the next time we go to negotiate a deal, the team we’re negotiating with will know that we’re willing to pay over the odds just to get a deal done. We don’t have the endless funds of Manchester City or Chelsea and so we can’t operate like that. And secondly, because we have a stadium to finance, and so all funds must be used carefully.


Teams are reluctant to sell. They try to hold onto players (as we have in the past) and that drives prices up. If they know a player wants out then they need to find a replacement. It all takes significant time.

So what is the impact of not getting deals done? Tom Collomosse – a writer I respect – wrote yesterday:

‘Between 2010-11 and 2012-13, Spurs won just one of their seven League games in August as first Harry Redknapp and then Andre Villas-Boas worked with squads still under construction. In two of those three seasons, they finished only one point outside the Champions League places.’

Further digging into statistics showed that the effect of not signing players early might not be so significant. Dazzazzad, a poster on COYS worked out that the points per game tallies with the seasons as whole:

‘Looking at the first 5 games from the last 5 seasons brought up 44 points for an average of 1.76 points per game. Looking at the full season points totals of the last 5 seasons we average – guess what? – 1.76 points per game.’""",null,0,null,1440350923,null,null,false,0,cucyskm,null,t3_3i2eoq,null,null,null,t1_cucyi0s,null,null,null,1441424156,null,4,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,4,null

How do you work that out? They were certainly on top at the time of the goal, but our counter was working. The goal allowed them to be conservative in their attacking phases, which meant we couldn't expose them on the counter in the same way we were doing before the goal. 

&gt;You're bootstrapping a lot of the hate that was put on him during a comprehensively bad spell last season. I wouldn't be so critical of it if I didn't see so many absolute shit comments from armchair goalkeepers.

I am not sure what context you are using bootstrapping in there mate, but I guess I understand what you are trying to say. If it was an isolated patch of fuzzy form last season, then I agree- people could be considered overly harsh. The fact is though that time and time again Howard has had these months of utterly idiotic football where he has cost us majorly. He has had one genuinely good season in the past 5, and that is just not good enough. 

&gt;Nor should it blind you to the real problem, three on Sterling, zero on Kolarov. Marking has been a far more significant issue than goalkeeping fundamentals - and if you disagree we should do a clip show battle.

I was in the showground at the time and just felt sick. I was with people who were sending water up to the crash site in bottles/containers, I assumed for people to drink as it was a hot day, that was not the case.
The kerosene had caused loads of people, more than the media are saying, to get badly burnt, and the guy who I spoke too said a small boy ran up to him with a huge laceration on his back that had been corterised by the fire, and all he could do was pour water over him and wrap cling film (plastic wrap) around him.
And recently, seeing images of the crash site it's self, flattened cars etc. That made me feel genuinely sick. It's amazing how something that you see for yourself is thousands of times worse than a photo or video.
To know that I saw the crash that killed 11+ people is just sickening. Especially as there was little I could do to help.

EUMETSAT is just the observation satellites and is one of many      things that get put into the weather models.

You need access to the models to be able to predict the weather, so most companies just buy the rights to access each of the models and then create forecasts based on that.

Note the Met office runs one of the main models! It also has a few none public models which nobody else has access to which enables them to provide further detail, which is well beyond what any other service can offer. Note they don't only use their own models they use GFS and ECM and their own collective experience to create the forecasts. This is all in danger if they lose the BBC contract as it makes up a massive chunk of their budget. I.e the UK will lose a world leader in a very important area all for a few million pounds.

Poor service isn't my problem at that point, it's the managers. I'm a waiter, my primary job is to see the customers have what they expect. That is exceedingly easy to meet. I don't mind busing tables if I can, or rolling up silverware, or whatever. But if I'm not meeting the service levels the customer expects it is probably because the manager is actively making the decision that X is more important than Y.  They are the boss. 

I am an American though. It is often shit pay. Usually my manager leaned on us because someone was leaning on them. You would be called off frequently and called in frequently.

I ask because under Mancini, Manchester City pretty much exclusively played a 4-4-2 with non-traditional wingers. Nasri played from the left and David Silva played from the right. It wasn't a diamond with 3 central midfielders. It was more like [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=8gy2n).

I think we could definitely play a 4-4-2 (or maybe you'd like to call it 4-2-4, doesn't really matter) with the wide players we have.

Don't think the diamond with 3 central midfielders would do well at all. Our fullbacks are just not good enough technically. Athletically they'd have no problem covering an entire side of the pitch but they would have to create a lot more than they're capable of. 

I don't think any team in England has the right type of fullbacks for a diamond, which is why it always seems to fail when teams try it.

All our leaders are these obvious politician types. Whoever wins the Labour leadership will be second favourite to George Osborne, hardly the man of the people that people seem to think the public will flock too. 

I think the main issue (and one i haven't really seen counter arguments for) is that all candidates are somewhat inferior on the leadership/image front to Ed Miliband. I didn't vote for him but I thought he was a reasonably decent leader, if a little uninspiring, yet he still didn't manage to win the election. I can't see any of the others doing much better (at this stage, early days admittedly) considering their lack of appeal compared to Miliband. I have no studies or hard evidence to back this up, only my own feelings and perceptions from the media, but I think a labour victory in 2020 with any of these four would come on the back of any perceived failures of the Conservatives, not the leadership quality of the Labour party.",null,0,null,1440352330,null,null,false,0,cuczk5z,null,t3_3i37sp,null,null,null,t1_cucygr9,null,null,null,1441424518,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Then, they pick up experience in free agency. It's lead to us punching above our weight for a long time.

Despite that, in my 21 year old lifetime we've won 2 superbowls, 3 NFC championships, and won our division 11 times. Any fan of sports could appreciate what Ted Thompson has managed as far as drafting talent. He's consistently gotten us players in late rounds that manage to impact the team in some way, depth at times, within a year or two. It seems he goes after the players with athletic traits you can't teach and high ambitions. Sorry for the long rant, but I've always wondered if people on this sub thought talent was won in some crazy gene lottery at birth or if it can be grown.

Right now it doesn't look like Koeman rates him in the slightest, which is worrying state of affairs given that he also doesn't trust the defensive capabilities of another new signing, Cedric the right back.

Is Les fucking up this transfer window all on his own, or is it a team effort?

The actual policy, with costings is [here if you are interested](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/assets/files/Policy%20files/Basic%20Income%20Consultation%20Paper.pdf). 

Although the policy is a good starting point its not quite what I would like, it still has areas that would require government interest in people living arrangements and is set at a low level, although higher than current JSA.

As a Corbyn supporter it might be of interest that Richard Murphy who is assisting with Corbyn's economic policy  co-authored a pamphlet with Howard Reed [Financing the social State: towards a full employment economy](http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/08/uk-jeremy-corbyn-richard-murphy-and-basic-income/), in which they advocate a Basic, or Citizens’ Income as part of a comprehensive reform of the tax and benefit system.

The kind of jobs that involve skilled, expensive labour and knowledge workers have been the most eroded. Our stereotypical image of a car production factory is no longer the Ford factory with the lot outside crammed with 7,000 workers, it's a conveyor belt surrounded on both sides by robot arms.

The only reason this isn't happening to YOUR job (if you have one) is that no-one found a way to automate it economically. Yet. If your job is taken by a robot, are you going to walk into a new one with higher pay? No. Not only are your now redundant job skills no longer as valuable, you have all the other guys who used to do your job vying for what's left, driving down pay even more.

That isn't going to support a thriving economy of consumer goods. It's creating a larger and larger class of people struggling to get by.

null,null,powatom,null,null,null,"&gt; I think Corbyn doesn't care that much about anti-semitism. He sympathises unthinkingly with those aligned against Western interests, regardless of their (often odious) views.

Perhaps, but I think it is probably more accurate to suggest that Corbyn favours 'the underdog' - perhaps naively in some cases, depending on how you view things. Not every underdog is worthy of sympathy, sure - but it is also true that things are very rarely black and white - and whilst Israel's opponents are often also vehemently anti-semitic, there are also legitimate grievances which can and should be addressed. Extremes of opinion hinder progress.

&gt; I want him to consider who he associated with more carefully. Promoting Hamas &amp; other anti-semites/homophobes/misogynists damages the pro-palestine cause, and it also makes it difficult for more moderate anti-Israel parties within Palestine &amp; elsewhere to get going.

This may indeed be true to some degree, but we also have to deal with reality - which is that Hamas and other similar groups do in fact control arms, wealth, power and people. Pretending that they don't is never going to solve anything. I would love to be able to just tell Hamas to fuck off and have them actually do so, but the world doesn't work like that.

&gt; His actions have real world consequences.

As do the actions of the people who can actually implement policy, sit down with warring factions, and attempt to figure out a way forward. Demanding absolute concession to Israel is not going to work. Hamas and groups like them are not going away without either a fight, or some other kind of resolution. We do too much harm to that part of the world via both direct and indirect measures to ever hope that they'll just forget about it all and move on. Whether it happens in 5 years or 50 years, or 500 years, an agreement must come and *both sides* must make concessions to the other. We cannot choose our enemies.

&gt; It's interesting you mention ""chilling effects"". Corbyn is a no-platformer - he supports boycotts of Israeli Universities who are doing weapons research, but not those Isreali academics who agree with him. This is bizarre, because Hamas, which is also involved in trying to make its weapons ever more deadly, is a ""friend""!

Inconsistent application of philosophy is hardly a trait that only Corbyn exhibits, and I'm not saying that he is perfect, but boycotting specific research undertaken on behalf of Israel is not the same thing as boycotting Israel in totality.

&gt; Can you explain to me why you don't find associations with anti-semites concerning?

Because I recognise that politics is not black and white, *especially* situations as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - and I do not believe that 'associating' with anti-semitic people or groups actually says much about a politician who must necessarily associate with all kinds of people, even those they disagree with. I'm sure Islington North has plenty of racists. It doesn't make Jeremy Corbyn racist - but he still has to represent their interests to at least some degree.

&gt; What do you think of conservative politicians hanging out with Islamaphobes - OK?

I probably don't have to mention this first part, but strictly speaking, without that goal it's 0-1 and still zero points.  You can absolutely argue that the shape of the game would be different, but then, we've historically been far better on the attack when chasing a match.  Also Browning was enough of a liability to unilaterally give up a goal in a different situation.  And, if you're going to argue shape of the game, Howard needs credit for it not being 0-1 or 0-2 due to some early defensive lapses.  That is, swap him for Robles or Ospina and it *might* be an even worse result (but might not!).

&gt; I am not sure what context you are using bootstrapping in there mate

On the whole, we seem prone to vitriol and confirmation bias.  See: Howard, Alcaraz, Distin, Kone, Barry, Bobby, etc.  Some of it is well-placed, some of it is not, but none of it is monotonic.  E.g. Alcaraz was MOTM just before he ruined our Europa campaign.  I absolutely agree that Howard has had some bad matches last season, but also see people conflate that with the poor run of form, teamwide.  I also identify him as a keeper that tends towards both brilliance and simple mistakes, which leads to a genuine economic controversy (and this match is a perfect example).

But you're right, I should not assert that you're guilty of this symptom I see so wide on this sub (and /r/soccer in general).

&gt; The defenders did their job.

Partially disagree.  It is better than letting Sterling run riot, but when I look again

Stones is on Sterling well, Cleverly picks up Kolarov, but is wrong side and doesn't attempt to help out, McCarthy is ball watching, expecting help if Sterling cuts inside.

In any event, Kolarov has to be picked up.

Dembele is good at tackling, fair enough, but his positioning is completely different to Matic even when he plays in central midfield. Matic cuts out a lot more passes.

I disagree even more on the idea that Dembele attempts to make incisive passes. It's really the exact opposite of the scenario you describe. He'll often very clearly see an opportunity for an incisive pass but then for some reason will hesitate and keep the ball. He uses the ball so completely differently from Matic it's just not close.

He's just too limited to be compared to such a complete player. He keeps the ball really fucking well, but that is literally all he does.

null,null,BritishHobo,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"&gt;The night sky over London was thick with choking black smoke, but in the hellish glow of the flames rising from a myriad burning buildings, the rioters, looters and demonstrators fighting on the city streets could just make out the United Nations helicopter taking Jeremy Corbyn away from 10 Downing Street to his retirement cottage in Ireland.

&gt;Not for him the Prime Minister’s Jaguar in which his hated Mrs Thatcher had departed on the night she, too, was deposed. All Government cars had long since been sold in a desperate bid to pay off the £3 trillion National Debt, after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank had refused to hand a bankrupt, basket-case Britain any more emergency loans.

&gt;In any case, the streets weren’t safe enough for a Prime Minister to drive along. Not since the police, furious at being unpaid for months, had gone on an indefinite strike.

&gt;People who saw Mr Corbyn as he said goodbye to his staff were shocked by his frailty. The strain of his thousand days in power had all but broken this 73-year-old man, the oldest Prime Minister since Churchill. His hands were trembling, his back bent. The look on his face was not one of anger or bitterness, instead he seemed baffled, bewildered and bemused. ‘I almost pity the old Commie,’ one American member of the UN peacekeeping force said. ‘He just can’t work out what went wrong.’

&gt;It had all seemed so different on that glorious day in May 2020 when Corbyn had stood on the doorstep of No 10 – by himself because his hatred of ‘all that personal stuff’ was so intense that he refused to be photographed with his third wife Laura Alvarez – and told the wildly cheering crowd: ‘This is a new dawn for the people of Britain.’

&gt;Corbyn’s chief of staff Owen Jones – a princeling of the Far Left elite as the son of two members of Militant Tendency and the grandson of a Communist – declared that the people had taken back their country. The Red Flag was hung from the windows of No 10. Russell Brand kept his garbled verbosity in check for once and simply tweeted: ‘YEEESSSSSS!!!!’

&gt;But perhaps the revellers should have paid more attention to the reason for Corbyn’s success. For it was the failure of even the mighty Chinese Communist Party to buck the laws of economics that had led to the China Crisis of 2016. The world’s second largest economy imploded, taking the rest of the world with it.

&gt;By the time the 2020 General Election came, the worst of the depression was over. But after four years of austerity and unemployment the electorate didn’t see it that way.

&gt;Voters believed Corbyn when he told them that their troubles were the fault of the super-rich, who grew ever wealthier while ordinary people were trapped in poverty.

&gt;The young in particular, galvanised by a brilliant social media campaign, had responded to this silver-bearded revolutionary who promised them free university education, no student debt and guaranteed jobs.

&gt;An astonishing 83 per cent of 18 to 25-year-olds turned out and gave him their vote. They, and the support of the 52 MPs from the Scottish National Party, were enough to get Corbyn into power.
And even if their elders were shocked when this passionate, lifelong republican point-blank refused to go to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen, his young supporters were thrilled by such a visible symbol that things had changed. Here, at last, was a politician who was going to keep his promises.

&gt;And what promises they had been. Corbyn pledged to clamp down on once-legal tax avoidance as well as illegal tax evasion, claiming that a staggering £120 billion a year could be raised just by forcing the rich to pay their due.
He would renationalise the railways, scrap Britain’s nuclear deterrent and do away with independent schools and the state system’s academies in favour of a centrally controlled National Education Service.

&gt;Even more eye-catching was Corbyn’s scheme for a National Investment Bank to back a massive programme of public works and house building, funded by the simple expedient of ordering the Bank of England to print more money.

&gt;‘This is quantitative easing for the people, not the bankers!’ he had declaimed to cheering fans, waving ‘Jez we can!’ banners. 

&gt;A plan to impose rent controls on private landlords had proved hugely popular, as was a total ban on fracking. And the same women who had once thronged Mumsnet to say how sexy they found Corbyn’s passionate commitment to his beliefs were delighted by his promise of a ‘gender-balanced Cabinet’. But as with all revolutions, there were casualties. The Labour establishment had persuaded themselves that somehow Corbyn could be controlled.

&gt;They hoped that wise heads such as the veteran party fixer Tom Watson or Corbyn’s rival for the leadership, Andy Burnham, would be the stabilising forces in the new Labour Cabinet and rein in some of the Corbynistas’ wilder fantasies.

&gt;The tide of extremist party members who had joined Labour to make Corbyn leader swept away anyone and everyone who had any link with the hated Blairite past.

&gt;One moderate, centre-left MP after another was deselected by constituency activists. Night after the night the TV news showed them making the slow walk from their front doors to the cameras at their gates, waiting for their confessions of failure.
In the run-up to the 2020 Election, Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, had issued warnings that no Government, of any party, could buck the markets. Printing money to fund otherwise unaffordable policies ‘had the same effects in every country that’s tried it, from Argentina to Zimbabwe’.

&gt;‘If you drastically increase the amount of money in the system, you drastically reduce its value. So you need more money to buy the same goods. That causes hyper-inflation. And with that comes disaster’.

&gt;Within days of becoming Prime Minister, Corbyn took his revenge. He stripped the Bank of its political independence, renamed it The People’s Bank and sacked Carney.

&gt;As he strode through Heathrow’s Terminal Five on the way to the plane returning him to his native Canada, Carney was confronted by a BBC reporter who asked: ‘How do respond to the Prime Minister’s comments that it’s the people, not the financial markets who control the UK economy?’

&gt;Carney gave a wry smile and said: ‘Well, I guess we’ll just have to see what the markets have to say about that.’

&gt;They soon spoke, loud and clear. The seizure of the Bank told Britain’s creditors that their money was no longer safe. The pound plummeted in value. There was a global sell-off of Treasury ‘gilts’, the Government bonds that finance the UK’s National Debt. The Government found that, instead of paying interest rates of less than two per cent, it was suddenly contending with Greek-style borrowing costs of ten per cent or more. Pundits spoke of a ‘Wonga economy’ as debt repayments alone became the Government’s single biggest expenditure.

&gt;Within weeks of the Election money was flooding out of Britain as the billionaires who had seen London as a safe haven realised that it had suddenly become a much more dangerous place.

&gt;The capital’s property prices started tumbling as the lavish mansions of Russian oligarchs, and the overpriced apartments bought off-plan by Far Eastern investors, deluged the market.

&gt;‘We will use these empty, unwanted homes for social housing,’ Corbyn said. That earned him plaudits with the public, who had yet to appreciate how the collapse of the London luxury property market would have an impact on the value of ordinary homes across the country. But the rest of the world was less impressed.

&gt;The IMF called for drastic cuts in Government spending. The Germans made it plain that Britain could not escape the medicine taken by other EU nations that had found themselves in crisis. London would have to take its orders from Berlin, just as Athens had done. Corbyn simply refused. In an emergency Budget, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Diane Abbott, revoked the tax exemptions given to foreign residents in the UK, announced a Capital Levy and Land Tax and raised the top rate of Income Tax to 95 per cent on incomes over a million pounds.

&gt;‘For too long,’ Corbyn said, ‘the poor have borne the brunt of the cuts. Now let’s have some austerity for the rich.’

&gt;Corbyn also attempted to reintroduce exchange controls, limiting the amount of money anyone could take out of the country. But in a world of instant electronic transfers, money was simply too mobile to be kept in any one place.

&gt;And now it really began to move. In a throwback to the 1970s – the last time the Labour Left tried to defy economic reality – the rich proved why sky-high tax rates raise rock-bottom revenues.

&gt;Faced with giving 95 per cent of their money to Chancellor Abbott, they simply left the country and paid nothing at all.",null,0,null,1440353823,null,null,false,0,cud0e8x,null,t3_3i3pzk,null,null,null,t1_cud07zp,null,null,null,1441424911,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,Jbwasted,England,'11 CBF125,null,"If you have a full car licence I don't believe you have to have a separate, physical provisional license. I showed my full car licence just before my CBT and that was fine. 

I'm pretty sure whatever licence you go for you'll start by doing a CBT. Upon completing that you'll be allowed to ride a 125 with L plates, no pillion and no motorways. I had a moped many years ago, so I did a geared CBT straight away, you'll probably be able to as well, or your licencing place may start you on a moped and then move you upto a geared bike later on the course. 

A CBT doesn't require a separate theory test. They also expire after 2 years. 

Post CBT you have the options of A1, A2 and A. From what I know; A1 is the same as CBT: limited to a 125 but no L plates, allowed pillion and allowed motorways (although 70+ mph multi lane traffic is no fun on a 125) however you'll have to take a mod 1+2 and a theory test as well as costing more. A2 licences I don't know much about other than they're not as limited but involve the same amount of testing and training. A is then a complete unrestricted/ride whatever you want licence, subject to a mod 1+2 and theory. 

I've gone the path of gain a CBT and theory, ride around on a 125 with L^^oser plates until I'm confident and skilled enough to go for a DAS/A license.  A1+2 licences seem to be aimed at restricting by age, so as I'm old enough to do a DAS but not experienced enough to, I figured it's more viable for me to learn on a CBT rather than try to get each and every licence with slight rewards/unrestrictions they bring, whilst being rather costly. 

Edit: I'll just add that I'm 25 and that I don't know everything about the licensing, so I may have got some things wrong. If you can't get a clear answer here/are still unsure, the best thing to do is get in touch with your local bike school.

&gt;British Airways reported record ticket sales on first-class flights out of London. And none at all coming back. One Direction went off on a US tour and never returned. Multi-millionaire comedians who had once cheered Labour couldn’t see the joke when confronted with a Labour Prime Minister who actually meant what he said about soaking the rich. The summer transfer window saw the Premier League’s biggest stars departing en masse. One club after another came up for sale as its Arab or American owners ran for the exit. A multi-billion pound league became a two-bob back-water with second-rate players, poverty-stricken clubs and half-empty stadiums.

&gt;The windows of Bond Street’s designer fashion stores were boarded up. The office-blocks of the City and Canary Wharf emptied as the banks that Corbyn hated so much left London, taking their high-spending, tax-paying employees with them.
It became a bitter joke that Corbyn, who loved immigrants and asylum seekers so much, had solved the immigration crisis at a stroke. He’d made Britain a country no sane immigrant would ever go near.

&gt;The Government’s debt payments were rocketing as the economy was contracting. Tax revenues were way down, unemployment and the cost of welfare way up.
Inflation approached 25 per cent. It was a perfect storm of financial catastrophe. But that wasn’t Corbyn’s only problem.
Ever since the darkest days of the Second World War, Britain and America had been bound by the Special Relationship. But to Corbyn, the US was not our closest friend but our most wicked enemy. And the feeling soon became mutual.

&gt;With Corbyn abandoning the nuclear deterrent and slashing defence spending, US President Donald Trump announced that America could no longer regard Britain as a reliable ally.
Corbyn did not have time to leave Nato of his own will. When he sold our nuclear submarines to President Putin at a cut-price rate, Trump called for the UK’s expulsion from Nato and imposed an embargo on the import of British goods.

&gt;Corbyn was entirely unrepentant, and his defiance delighted his supporters. He made a grovelling apology for the ‘illegal’ Iraq War, promised that British soldiers would never again go to war in support of American imperialism and called for the prosecution of the ‘war criminal’ Tony Blair.

&gt;His fans loved the contrast between the billionaire Trump and Comrade Corbyn, happily digging the vegetable beds at his allotment.But Corbyn’s foreign policy did not sit so well with the public. Protesting that he had never been guilty of anti-Semitism, the Prime Minister declared that Israel was the chief obstacle to peace in the Middle East, and described Islamic State as a partner in the peace process. He was photographed shaking hands at No 10 with the leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Islamic terrorist organisations.

&gt;‘Let’s be thankful for small mercies, at least Her Majesty won’t have to dine with these ghastly people,’ sighed one Palace official. Corbyn had, of course, abolished all state banquets.

&gt;As the third year of the Corbyn administration dawned, public unease was rapidly turning to outright opposition. His allies in the public sector unions were disgusted when their members’ salaries were cut by a quarter, then half, then two-thirds as the Treasury ran out of money to pay them.

&gt;A loaf of bread passed the £5 barrier. Blackouts became increasingly common. The nation’s few remaining factories fell idle. Hospitals could no longer afford to pay for basic medicines.

&gt;Declaring a ‘siege economy’, and ‘socialism in one country’, an increasingly exhausted Corbyn made desperate pleas for the people to rally against the forces of capitalism. But the introduction of food rationing was the final straw.

&gt;The disorder that had played out on the streets of Athens a decade earlier were now replayed on a vastly bigger scale. As riots became commonplace, families lived under self-imposed curfew.
Meanwhile, the media reporting the growing opposition to the Government, and the whispers of a ‘no confidence’ vote in the House of Commons, were accused of treachery. The Far Left had always believed that their inability to win elections was due to the machinations of Right-wing press barons who poisoned the people’s minds against them.

&gt;They needed little excuse to censor the press and broadcasters in the interest of ‘fair, honest and truthful reporting’. A blogger who wrote that Britain was descending to the level of Zimbabwe was prosecuted for libelling the memory of President Robert Mugabe.
Ironically, it was Corbyn’s better nature that finally defeated him. He lacked the Stalinist zeal to force the people into submission. 
&gt;Like his hero Tony Benn, he still believed in Parliament and refused to give in to radical Ministers who called for its abolition, or, at least, the banning of the Conservative Party.

&gt;And thus, on the day it was announced that international peacekeepers would have to be brought in to help bring order back to Britain, the Leader of the Opposition, Boris Johnson, was able to call a vote of no confidence, secure the necessary two-thirds majority and force a General Election.

&gt;‘Give him enough rope and he will hang himself,’ a Blairite had said when Corbyn was elected Labour leader. That was true enough.

For those reasons, I think it's very dependent on the opposition left back and defensive style which player will be the better choice. Against Watford though, both would be phenomenal. Nasri for the little time he's been on so far has been fantastic, and Navas is clearly on form. Either can take on Watford in this form so might as well give it to Nasri.

null,null,Crusadaer,EN,england,null,"John Terry was, I feel, sent off wrongly today. 

If you watch the replay, JT is trying to get in front of Rondon, and Rondon is holding him off, which both are fully entitled to do.

Now, the 'issue' here is our Captain having his arm in a place other than firmly at his sides or up in the air. He was making contact with Rondon, but was not pulling him down any more than Rondon was pushing JT away. It was a clear, fair contest for the ball.

Clattenburg was too far away and did not have a good enough line of sight to make the call. The Assistant Referee (linesman) has the perfect view, and chooses not to flag for a foul. There is no way Clattenburg could have seen what JT's arm was doing, and having seen the replay from multiple angles there is no 'downward' or 'backward' motion coming from JT's arm at the time of the player falling, meaning that it definitely isn't a pull for me.

Rondon definitely dived, that goes without saying, but there was contact of some sort so it is to be expected. Just not enough for a foul.

No line of sight by Clattenburg, no flagging from the assistant, no obvious foul by Terry, just a dive followed by a foul. As a referee myself, you tend to give benefit of the doubt to the defender in this situation.

IF you call the foul however, it's a red. Every time. In this regard, Clattenburg was not wrong for producing a red, but for blowing the whistle at all. 

Either way, it's an injustice, and hopefully the FA overturns it. But I doubt it.",null,0,null,1440354710,moderator,null,false,0,cud0w32,null,t3_3i30yf,null,null,null,t3_3i30yf,null,null,null,1441425145,null,10,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,10,null

Falcao was a stupid idea at the time and I feel no loyalty to the man. He's done nothing for us yet except miss chances just like Torres did. He's forcing a player who actually played well for us in limited minutes onto the bench and giving absolutely nothing back. Costa *will* be out for at least a month this season and I'd be pretty if I were you about our title chances if we had to rely on Falcao.

null,null,casisa,null,null,null,"No, the term ""useful idiot"" refers to someone working against their own interests under the assumption of helping themselves, this is contextual given the accusations of anti-Semitism aimed at Corbyn, it's not an attack on anyone's race or religion, it's providing additional context to the usage of the phrase.

You've switched from accusations of racism (which we have laws against in this country so feel free to report the tweet you find to be racist), to accusations of being patronising, which is not a criminal act. Which is it?

I see a problem here, and it's not hypocrisy or racism, I'll agree that it's patronising, but that would be the case without the word ""Jewsish"" in it, ""Useful idiot"" is a patronising phrase. 

By the way, maybe calm down a bit before attacking me for words I haven't used, I don't. ""patronisingly think"" anything of the sorts. 

Edit. Guys, broaden your horizons, get off the computer and talk to real people, this is not something to be offended about, I'm Jewish, I look Jewish, I live in Bradford, I've seen and been victim of real, tangible anti-Semitism, this tweet is most definitely not anti-Semitic, no matter how much you love and want to defend Corbyn.

2. You cannot predict where Remy would've been or what he would have done with any accuracy whatsoever.
3. Falcao's hold up play is brilliant. He is incredibly strong despite being short and plays the CF role really well. With Remy, he's more like Anelka and likes to drift from the CF position.

Where I used to work a while ago I'd often get thrown into the kitchen when a chef let us down. Granted I wasn't doing the harder stuff like steak but I was still cooking. It's not the cooking that gets you, it's the plating up. Fuck them lightbulbs that keep the food warm while waiting for service, there is a special place in hell for them.

Anyway, I'd actively try and get shifts in the kitchen rather than front of house. To me both were just as stressful as each other when busy, but at least in the kitchen you don't have to deal with customers clicking their fingers (literally..) at you and on one occasion being called an ""absolute idiot"" because I served a gentleman exactly what he had ordered. I know you shouldn't let it get to you, but there is nothing as demoralising as being treated like absolute shit by a customer when all you can realistically do is smile and apologise (that goes for all customer service jobs).

What I would say though is that when things go wrong in the kitchen, it spirals into madness far faster than it does front of house (at least in my experience).

I personally believe kitchen staff deserve a share of tips. But on the other hand, when I tip I tip for service which is above and beyond the basic required of the job, whereas in my mind cooking the food, plating it up and getting it out to me is the basic job required of a chef. Having said that, I often have to mess waiting staff and chefs around due to allergies (I try not to as I know how hard it can be, but sometimes it's unavoidable) and for the most part everyone is lovely about it, and it's not uncommon for the chef in nicer places to pop out and draw up some recommendations, in them cases I think the chef deserves a little tip, he's gone above and beyond the minimum required of them to accommodate me, and that, to me, deserves a 'reward'.

I recommend finding a cheap and cosy pub to spend time in over the winter - break up the monotony of being indoors.

I mentioned the fact that one sector of society is expected to survive on NMW without tips while the service industry almost expects tips in my comment. I was simply pointing out that, as things currently stand with regard to the minimum wage, tips do benefit workers - which you said they do not. I fully understand the economic implications of tipping becoming the norm, thus allowing businesses to get away with paying a sub-living wage. I dont disagree on an ideological level.

The problem is, banning tipping won't force businesses to pay a higher wage. If tipping were banned tomorrow, I couldn't afford to refuse to work unless I was pai more. My options would be to remain working where I am on minimum wage, find another job, or quit out of principal and starve. If I went to another service industry job at the same level, I would still be on the same money; why would I be offered more when the industry is already full of people desperate for work who would do the same job without complaint for the pay I'd be arguing about? If I went to retail I'd be on minimum wage without any expectation whatsoever that I would be tipped. The other option is to find a ""real"" job, but I can attest that that proves to be very difficult when all your work experience is in retail and service. I've been looking for a 9-5 since I graduated with a First last year; I've got 13 years retail and bar experience, 6 of those at a managerial level, and I'm more than happy to talk about how my skills are incredibly transferable. Unfortunately a lack of office experience makes it rather hard to transition out of the service industry.

This post has become much longer than I intended, so apologies for that. To reiterate; I don't disagree with you at all, but changing the culture of low, unliveable wages requires a much larger culture shift than simply banning tipping.

Let's not forget this is the country that removed people from office they didn't like in OTHER COUNTRIES via the CIA and installed their own sympathetic leaders.*

As opposed to the subtle Europeans who, last time they had the power to play on the world stage, subjugated the entire African continent, Indian subcontinent, the entire Americas, and fought actual shooting wars with China to ensure their continued trade dominance? When the British and French didn't like a ruler, they invaded the country and installed not only their favoured man, but a couple hundred soldiers and a colonial office. Or China, who last tried to impose their will on a nation (Vietnam), by invading it, and are now posturing in the South China Sea to near the point of military confrontation? Or Russia, which, as you may have seen recently, is not exactly subtle or unimposing when it tries to get its way?

The US as hegemon has been the least heavy-handed Great Power in world history.

*You expect them to play fair if allowed to decide who benefits in trade agreements?*

You expect the EU to? Or the Chinese? Or the Russians? This is international relations, not a college debate society.

*Fact of the matter is, if they WANT to create this worldwide structure, why not announce it? Why not say outright hey, here's what we want to do, are you on board?*

Because that's how the world works. Because there's always going to be someone who opposes a plan like that. Because admitting things like that brings out all the people who think international relations is a college debate society, and then they scupper all progress by throwing up a pointless shitstorm because they see the world working in a way that doesn't match their utopian dreams.

*No, the US slinks around in the shadows, pulling strings from behind the scenes like it has some kind of RIGHT to tinker with the world. Fuck that noise.*

null,null,cock_blockula,null,null,null,"&gt; Let's not forget, this is the guy who endorses Venezuela's economic policies

From the link, the policies he seems to be endorsing are that the poor aren't left to starve (which to be fair was standard and pretty uncontroversial here until recently), that people get to see doctor no matter their income (hang on a minute we have something like that), and can get a decent education (something that we also have to large degree). Actually these are the norm acThe only controversial policy is the one of land reform, which is currently taking place in Scotland just now, and rich people hoarding land is generally not good for an economy if it can be put do productive use. I don't see him endorsing running Britain in an analogous way to Venezuela. Is he planning on making petrol practically free and opening up a massive black market that feeds corruption? Is he planning on having an economy dependent on natural resources for over half of GDP and &gt;90% exports. 

&gt;Success for radical policies in Venezuela is being achieved by providing for the poorest, liberating resources, but above all by popular education and involvement.

It's also worth noting that the article appears to be from between 2005 and 2007 given that he mentions Blair as leader and refers to a 2005 trade conference. Between those years the Venezuelan economy was growing around 9-10% a year according to the World Bank, so Chavez's social policies would have been having success at that period so the statement is not inaccurate.

&gt; But, I guess it's smearing to quote his own words verbatim from his own website. The rule seems to be that we shouldn't judge Corbyn on anything he said prior to July 2015.

I didn't work in a flashy bar, I worked in a local pub and tips were scarce at the best of times. So, whilst I realise they may benefit a few people, they certainly don't benefit everyone.

To be honest, it is my personal opinion that we should all fight for a higher minimum wage, even those of us who now earn more than minimum wage, because noone should have to rely on voluntary contributions when they work full time, in order to get by, and as I said I'm my original post, I am now reaching the point where I think tipping *should* be banned. Not least because it appears to prop up a too low minimum wage, but also because it is clearly being abused by unscrupulous businesses.

Look - this is straight out of the socialist play-book.  Venezuela is good, because they're socialist and because they stick two fingers up at the Americans.  It's been a cause celebre of leftists for years.

I've been a Spurs fan for 6 years now. I'm a firm believer in you don't pick the team, the team picks you.

I can't recall the exact moment when I became a fan, I just remember going to the Premier League website in 2009 looking at all the current teams looking for a club to support. I knew I didn't want to like a Big 4 team that everyone outside of England supports (IE. Chelsea, Arsenal, Man Utd, Liverpool) but I wanted to like a team that is consistently in the Premier League because it's hard to watch Championship games in Canada.

I remember being a fan of the logo, a cockerel standing on top of a ball. I remember looking at the name Tottenham Hotspur Football Club and loving how unique it was, I loved their colour scheme. They had a great team at that time, Van der Vaart, Bale, Modric, Lennon, Defoe... they also had him.. my favourite player at the time, a fan since his late goal against Trinidad and Tobago in the 83rd minute in the 2006 World Cup.. my boy, the human string bean himself...

Peter Crouch.

They ended up qualifying for the Champions League that year, beating the defending champs Inter in the round of 16. They eventually lost in the quarters, but I wasn't super disappointed, they were my team.

Since then I've learned to appreciate and love the club even more. The songs the crowds sing, the passion they have, the love they have for the team even through the tough times. It disappoints me when people tell me they're Utd, CFC, Man City, or Scum fans because I believe they really can't learn how to fully appreciate a club the way I appreciate my Spurs (Let's face it, Canadians only like these teams because they are consistent Champions League clubs). I love Spurs not because they're winners (sometimes they are) but because they've always hung around, they have the best fans, and doggone they are the most proper football club in England!

null,null,JavaTheCaveman,null,null,null,"Nah, bus and train are your only real options.  Overall, I reckon it may be pretty similar either way, in terms of time.  Here're the pros and cons of each, as I see them.

Note: for both the bus and the train, your cash saving obviously improves the more months' worth of ticket you buy.

**BUS**

+ PRO  runs all night - okay, it's not frequent, but it runs all night.
+ PRO about the quarter of the price for a rail season ticket.  Fares for Oxford Tube [here](http://www.oxfordtube.com/tubefares.aspx), and X90 [here](http://x90.oxfordbus.co.uk/fares/).  Note that they're exactly the same.  It's almost as if it were a fucking stitch-up or something.  
+ PRO (Oxford Tube only) I find it quickest to get off at Shepherd's Bush and catch the Central line from there, and not Marble Arch.  Yes, that makes it a London zone 2-1 journey, but I think that's worth it for speed.  This is why I usually catch the Oxford Tube over the X90.
+ PRO it runs through your side of town
- CON traffic can make it take *far* longer than the train, by a magnitude of *hours*.
- CON ridick crowded at peak times - I've often had a full bus blaze past me unless you board at either Gloc Green or Victoria.  Note that there are a few stops in town before it hits you at St. Clement's.
- CON you can't buy a ticket that covers both the Oxford Tube and the X90.
- CON (EDITED) you apparently *can* take your bike, but may need a special reservation.

**TRAIN**

+ PRO way faster - by at least 30m each way.
+ PRO far fewer overcrowding problems.  Source: spent two months commuting to be in London at 9AM, and returning at about 6PM.  The journey back can be a little busy as far as Reading, but overall I found it fine (especially chilled in the morning, actually).
+ PRO more comfortable than a bus, IMO.
+ PRO There are going to be twice as many trains per hour, with the opening of [the new line to Marylebone.](http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/oxford-london)
- CON cost.  I couldn't link, so [here's a screengrab](http://i.imgur.com/JpWSkoC.png) of the fares.  Oh God, is it expensive.
- CON as far as I know (I could be very wrong) you'll have to pick between FGW and Chiltern Rail when picking which route to use.  Again, this may be my mistake.
- CON probably a 10-minute cycle (on a good day) to the rail station from Cowleyland.

**HOW I FOUND COMMUTING**

Get some decent earphones.  I found it most bearable by listening to a staggering volume of podcasts and audiobooks.  (Time for me to plug *The Stand* by Stephen King, read by Grover Gardner!)

I've done rail and road.  Overall, when I can afford it, I go for rail.  This is partly because I live in Witney, and still have an hour-long bus journey on either end.  Oxford rail station is on the right side of town for me.  Plus, it's incredibly frustrating how much time the buses waste stopping everywhere in Oxford.  I'd happily pay more for the extra 90m I saved each day by catching the train.

The buses were really pissy (or at least inconsistent) about hot drinks - something I really enjoyed in the morning.  A big plus for the train!

I've been following [Mensch's twitter feed](https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch) for a while - and I haven't seen any hint that she's trying to deceive people or resort to underhand tactics.  It's just not in her nature.

Another I feel should be up there is Chaula's Indian Restaurant, just because it's dish 'Masala Dosa' is absolutely incredible and they do it to perfection. I completely recommend it.

Rondon really showed what he can do. He played alone up front for most of the game and played well considering that, you know, Chelsea's defence is pretty damn good.

Lambert will take a few games to get back into the swing of things, and a run of games/some clear confidence in him from Pulis will go a long way.

We can probably all agree that Boaz was fantastic the best part of last season, but after today I really don't think he can cut the mustard long term. Will be nice when Foster comes back and they can both play for their places!

Our defence was the worst part of our game. At times it was comical. However we do have a potential new signing in the works and we did have a lot of defensive money and experience on the bench, so I'm not too worried. 

Some of you may disagree, but I really don't think Berahino is off just yet, even after being left out of the squad. In January? Sure, But Peace has said he's not going, and that man hasn't taken a wrong step recently.

Nope. If you did it within 6 months then it'll affect it because you applied for lots of credit within a short amount of time.

Also, a car costs nowhere near a house, so if you were doing it the other way around, then you might have had an issue, because your total level of credit is already really high.

You have absolutely no understanding of the Local Housing Allowance and/or the ""bedroom tax"" do you?

If a family requires 2 bedrooms then they get paid the LHA rate for 2 bedrooms. If they live in a 2 bed council house then they get the LHA rate for 2 bedrooms because that is what they need.

If they live in a 3 bed council house then they still only get the rate for 2 bedrooms because they only require 2 bedrooms. However, because of the fact that they have a spare bedroom - and bear in mind every council has different interpretations of bedroom, based on its size - then they would lose 14% of the LHA.
At no point were the family ever paid anything for the third bedroom because it had already been determined that they didn't need it. 

However, if that same family lived in a private rental then they wouldn't get penalised for having a third bedroom.

If you think this Tory Policy is fair then I suggest you actually go and read exactly what LHA is, how it is paid and how the bedroom tax affects it because you clearly have no clue.

null,null,sb452,Homerton,Homerton,null,"In maths, Trinity differs from other colleges in its size (~40 undergrads per year - the highest other college is 16, and the average is nearer 8), and quality. Trinity attracts a disproportionately large number of International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) contestants. Not all IMO-ers go to Trinity, and not all Trinty mathmos are IMO-standard (there are some normal ones, as well as some IMO-ers who don't adapt well to Tripos). This means that Trinity has a group of very able mathmos. But also, 40 people is too big to be one clique - Trinity is probably the only college where there will always be more than one social circle of mathematicians - so there will definitely be a more serious circle of mathmos, but there will also definitely be a less serious circle. In some of the smaller colleges, it may be that you won't find a ""study buddy"" as easily. It also means that not everyone at Trinity will be taught by the same supervisor for each subject. Anyway, the overall message is that everyone at Cambridge is intelligent, everyone (well, 97% of people) works hard (although not all admit it), but there will also be people in each college who enjoy having a good time. Trinity is an outlier for maths in quality and quantity - it is not unique in having a core of highly talented mathmos, but it will have this core every year, whereas for other colleges it's a bit more hit and miss.",null,0,null,1440361117,null,null,false,0,cud4l46,null,t3_3i3oql,null,null,null,t3_3i3oql,null,null,null,1441426952,null,4,null,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,4,null

Just to make clear, I ride my bike 40 miles every day on average, come rain or dry. It is my only mode of transport and I work in an office roughly 20 miles from home. Once or twice a month I go about 60 miles in one day to a contractors office, and I use the bike for that too. 

Because it's used so often, I try to keep it in the best shape I can. Get new consumables when they're needed, give the bike a good health check at least once a week, make sure it's fit and ready to ride. I'm quite strict with it - if I feel in any doubt with regards to it, I don't ride it. It's a nuisance sometimes because I do use it so often and I am so strict about its condition. I make sure I get quality materials when I do do it - proper brand oil, battery, plugs etc etc. I don't want to skimp out, because I don't want this thing to let me down when I need it most.

That quite often unfortunately results in there being a lot of outgoings per month on the bike. I have to shell out about £130 for a rear ~~wheel~~ tyre replacement tomorrow, because a selfish 2"" nail decided to bed itself in there late last week (need the bike picked up as I can't actually get it to the garage - its a very nasty nail!). Second puncture in two months, probably just bad luck, but that will be £240 on the bike in two months - only on tyres!

So the costs for riding are quite high, probably similar to the costs of driving if you do the same miles in the same conditions I do. It's certainly more expensive with a bigger bike - 125 consumables tended to be pretty cheap (change out of £100 for a full tyre set change, £10 instead of £35 on new oil and filter, one spark plug instead of four..!) - so it's something to be aware of.

Your might spend a heck of a lot less than I do, you may spend a lot more... I don't just roll the bike out on weekends, nor do I only ride when the sun is shining.

Which is not what social housing should be. Social housing should be affordable for those on low incomes. 

Penalising the poor for having a spare bedroom by removing a minimum of 14% of their entitlement for the actual number of rooms they require is ridiculous.

Especially considering there is a severe lack of 1 bedroom properties, so those that live in a 2 bed have nowhere to go.

They could of course, move into a private rent, take more in LHA and have a spare bedroom without losing any money at all - which ends up costing the tax payer more.

Politicians of all colours are overly positive about those they align with economically, socially, strategically etc. Cameron falls into this regarding the likes of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt. Personally I would rather buy my oil from Venezuela than Saudi.

&gt; Venezuela is good, because they're socialist and because they stick two fingers up at the Americans. It's been a cause celebre of leftists for years.

I agree many on the left are overly fond of defending Venezuela, but at the same time I don't think you should take the reluctance to criticise as a full endorsement. People pick and choose their battles and logically it makes more sense for the left to criticise those who are further away from themselves, at the same time this is arguably one of the cons of solidarity as legitimate criticism is less often aired. I wouldn't endorse running a country like Venezuela but of the policies I noted in my previous post why shouldn't Corbyn praise these things? The Chavez government did achieve some positive things it also handled other things disastrously. Talking up the good and ignoring the bad is not unique to socialists or left wing politicians.

I don't know what her explanation is, but I can certainly make an educated guess.   If you look at her twitter-feed over the past few weeks she's been trying to expose antisemitic Corbyn supporters and those who have used misogynistic slurs against Kendall.  Hence, the presence of those terms in her search history.  She was using them to search for antisemites and misogynists.

&gt;The person he insulted was just a random Jewish guy who didn't like the fact that he's pushing Corbyn as an anti-semite.

I honesty don't know.  Do you?  It may be that they have a history exchanging tweets or this 'random' guy said some very stupid things to Hodges, and Hodges was trying to retaliate in kind.  I'm sure a guy like him gets hit with constant trolling.

&gt;I gather that the reason inflation is not scaling out of proportion is the the BoE limits how much fake cash banks can create

Sort of true, not sort of true. The BoE declares how much of a bank's assets have to be ""liquid"" (mostly in bonds). So this limits the amount of loans banks can make and keep on their books. The way banks can get around this is by packaging up their loans and selling them on. Financial organisations tend to think mortgages are a bit dodgy these days, though.

The other way inflation is limited is that people have to take a mortgage. This ties the money creation to something physical. And is also a good reason for the price madness that is going on, and the government's support of it.

The biggest reason inflation is not going crazy, is that the rich who are doing the best out of this situation are investing their money rather than spending it.

Both of the managers want to play champagne football but City have the horses for it and we don't. We can play that way against many clubs in the league but not the sides built off petrol money. Howard should have saved the match winner but he made a couple of massive saves early on that kept us in the match. I was hoping for a nil-nil result honestly.

Now to the ugly part. I must say it has been a long time since I was embarrassed by fellow Evertonians but today was a day where I heard from this vocal minority who want to take every chance to attack the board and Goodison. I confronted one of them after the match and I had to remove myself from any further contact with this young lad.

null,null,ByresRd,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,null,"In a sense, I am lucky because I have a strong CV and background in work. While I am looking for any work that will pay me £6.50 an hour simply to get back in action, it just so happens that there are more jobs available in my field (higher paid) than there are at the bottom end of the scale. However, my interview around 10 days ago was for minimum wage and would have been the lowest wage I have received since leaving school all that time ago. Unfortunately I didn't get it and I'm waiting on feedback back but, it wouldn't surprise me if it was because I am simply too qualified. There is a greater chance of me getting the job I am going for this week which pays double.

Also consider that the job process for minimum wage work can also be a much longer process than it used to be. Take for example a job I applied for a few months ago (to work on top of my full time job for extra cash). It was to work 8 hours per week in a warehouse for a large retail company. It required a numerical reasoning + situational judgement test. I mean, come on. I used to manage a stockroom.

In February, I also applied for a job as a cleaner on a local ferry service for 10 hours a week to top up my existing wages. Again, interview went well but didn't get it. I'm not capable of mopping the floor.

So there are two examples of low paid, minimum wage jobs that I couldn't get. It can be difficult to get those ""trivial"" jobs just, as you say, to stop yourself from going crazy. I'm one of those people who would say ""you need to take responsiblity for yourself. If there are no opportunities out there then you need to create them"". But, unfortunately, now being in a situation where I need a safety net, it isn't that simple. 

But, anyway, here's the real issue I have with all of this: the change in system leaves no safety net for 5 weeks for signing on, right? So the job centre hand out food vouchers to get you by. My issue with this is that the food bank service is provided by the good nature of volunteers out there giving up their free time. The food is provided by the public (and businesses of course). So basically, the system fails as a safety net for 5 weeks for those who are actively seeking work and the actual safety net that you think you are paying your taxes for comes down to a volunteer service provided by those same tax payers.",null,0,null,1440363879,null,null,false,0,cud68fr,null,t3_3i2o0s,null,null,null,t1_cud5bn4,null,null,null,1441427728,null,17,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17,null

There is a need for evidence in all of these cases and personal statements from people involved.

You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to get a sense of something funny having gone on in the past and high up powers covering things up.

what many/most fail to realise is the 12-15mph speed is actually quite logical. It's my understanding that the 12mph figure is based on the avarage speed that someone hits the ground from a falling hight. This Is important because you can have the forward momentum of say 60mph (for example) and when you fall from your bike no matter what your forward speed you will still hit the ground with a downward force of around 12-15mph.

Of course your forward momentum will still be 60ish mph, and that's another problem all together ;) 

This is illustrated in motorbike racing where racer regularly fall from their bikes at 40-100mph. They always hit the tarmac with the same downward force.

null,null,Collosis,null,null,null,"In itself I'd be wary of investing too much in London property.  To me it smacks of 1999 where people have seen such huge gains that they've forgotten about fundamentals.  I rent a small flat in west London that's probably worth around £330,000 yet is a small place for only a couple to live in.  In any other part of the UK that valuation would seem absolutely ridiculous.  

There are a couple of economic effects that have caused this updraft.  Imbalance between supply and demand of investable opportunities, fear of investing in financial assets due to the 2008 meltdown meaning people are favouring tangible assets, the bulletproof British legal system coupled with QE across the world meaning that cash has to be invested in something and London property is the safest bet for the ultra rich, the belief that London is overcrowded and hence must have constant pent up demand for housing that can't be met by supply, the idea that London will forever have a world-leading economy and never-ending supply of jobs for renters, etc. etc.

All in all, investing in London property means you have to assume the upward factors will continue and that there isn't a reversal.  I'm looking to buy a place with my girlfriend and we're looking at other English cities because it would be so easy to buy a small, 2 bedroom flat for £400,000 only for the property bubble to pop and we'd be left thinking ""why the fuck did we spend almost half a million on a property that in Manchester / Birmingham / Cardiff / etc. would be worth a third that?  Were the warning signs not there?""

The main reason I'd be wary of investing in London is immigration.  The surge in property prices has been because so many young Brits moved to London as the powerhouse of job availability and have done so with tons of Eastern &amp; Southern Europeans.  Demand for accommodation has gone through the roof (wheyyy property joke).  The British economy is starting to pick up across the country, and it is my belief (hardly concrete though) that economies in peripheral Europe, Asia and north Africa will start blossoming again at some point in the next 10 years.  When that happens a number of those immigrants will likely start going back to where their families are, much like how young people will flock away from the capital to cities where their income actually enables them to thrive not survive.

Property partner: I've had a look at property partner and probably wouldn't recommend it.  2% initial investment fee is huge and because it comes at the start this will eat into your rate of return.  I couldn't comment on on whether the 15% fee on rental income is good or bad but if that's low then I would consider it.

Investing in just 2 or 3 properties is really weak diversification too.  If you want to invest in UK property but with far better diversification &amp; liquidity (ease of sale if you need to) and lower fees, I'd go for this:

We can demolish and rebuild sub par post-war housing but that doesn't really net us any increase. There is no one policy we can employ across the whole of the country, each case needs to be assessed on its own basis which is both time consuming and costly, but it absolutely requires levels of investment that simply aren't there.

That said, i do think we could benefit from some new design and architecture philosophies rather than just copy pasting pretty much exactly the same houses we've been building since the 40s. I think there's definitely scope for maximising our use of limited space without impacting on quality of life, and introducing variety in design.

I doubt that specific set up is common but I would find them a 1 or 2 bed flat in the area they can afford and offer them this, if they then reject this I don't think an under occupancy charge is unwarranted. However the situation I have described in many cases does not exist. There is a shortage of 1 and 2 bed properties due to lack of house building and changes in our society that has led to more people living alone. Given that we have a square peg and a round hole we have to think of the problem in the long term i.e build more affordable housing that is suited to a changing society's need as none of the short term solutions are sustainable e.g the bedroom tax.

I ran a small self-harm support charitable organisation, and while my experience is still VERY limited, I had counsellors and mental health organisations calling me for advice! I felt very much out of my depth but actually helped more than I gave myself credit for.

I'm not saying there isn't a problem, and I'm not supporting the Torys (I'm a Labour voter). But suicide in these scenarios speak more of Mental Health cuts than general Austerity.

Until people are dying of starvation in Britain, poor sanitation, poor water and poor health on a more than individual basis, like they are elsewhere on this planet then in the UK we're still in a very good position. 

The Tories are making things harder for for the poorer people in society, but even under cuts, the worst off are able to get food, clean water and medical attention, even if they do have to fight for it at times.

I have been homeless and jobless for several months, and yet have still not spent a single night on the streets (nor in friend's/family houses). Obviously not everyone is as lucky as I was, but knowing in an accident I'll be picked up off the street and not sent home without a clean bill of health without paying a penny outside my NI and tax contributions is amazing. Knowing if I run out of food, there are council stores and charities is a lifesaver. Knowing if I end up homeless again there are several options available to me is something unique to our islands!

If you look at her twitter-feed over the past few weeks she's been trying to expose antisemitic Corbyn supporters and those who have used misogynistic slurs against Kendall. Hence, the presence of those terms in her search history. She was using them to search for antisemites and misogynists.

Possibly, but if that was the case she could have explained it, instead she's deleted every tweet in relation to it and refused to comment. 

&gt;I honesty don't know. Do you? It may be that they have a history exchanging tweets or this 'random' guy said some very stupid things to Hodges, and Hodges was trying to retaliate in kind. I'm sure a guy like him gets hit with constant trolling.
In any case - it appears he's made an apology and it was accepted.

They don't, it's easy to check

Wrong?  If you work in politics and can't put forward your best face on a platform which lets you choose what you put down and analyze it before hitting send you do deserve to be judged on them.  If it was something written before he was in the public eye i could see that argument holding water

&gt;Honestly - it does strike me as hypocritical that supporters of a guy who has spent his entire political career rebelling against his own party should be so intolerant of dissent. Seems his supporters don't value 'principled dissent' - not when it contradicts with their opinions.

If Corbyn becomes Labour leader then at the next general election you will have to vote for a party whose leader has no chance of becoming PM, not that that's a bad thing... one can only hope that FPTP will have been ditched by 2020 though.

&gt;  I think that he's an ideologue who throws in his lot with various causes based on whether they align with ~~Marxist-socialist~~  values

Surely this can be criticism that can be leveled at any one though, just replace socialist with whatever is relevant. People align with those who they share common goals and interests and put aside the negatives. I think aligning Corbyn's support of Venezuela with implication that he'd be economically incompetent is stretching it a bit. I'm yet to see him put forward price controls on a wide range of commodities or say he is going to un-diversify the economy so we are dependent on one, volatile, sector. I don't see any policies that will lead to the kind of endemic corruption in Venezuela. Most of the main issues Venezuela does seem to have are ones that I don't think could be imported to Britain by Corbyn, he has said he will build bridges across the party so ther's no chance of the 2020 manifesto consisting of unfettered socialism. He will use his socialist principles to get some leftward movement on issues that the public do support e.g rail nationalisation. Personally I'd like to see what a Corbyn Labour would manage to come up as the other 3 don't seem to be much of a change from the status quo.

&gt;some ~~jackass~~ highly trained, certified professional performed a ~~risky, high speed stunt~~ routine, planned and certified aerobatic manoeuvre ~~above their heads without their consent~~ over an airfield on a course designed to minimise risk to any bystanders.

You seem to be assuming that the pilot intended to get close to that road, that he deliberately got close. That isn't true, had the manoeuvre gone as planned he would in fact not have been anywhere near them.

The problem is that something did go wrong, and thats why he ended up where he did. The things that need looking at are the contingency planning for when something does go wrong.

Which brings me back to my three points. The fact is that there are regulations governing airshows and aerobatic routines designed to protect bystanders so one of three things happened.

1) This pilot deliberately ignored those regulations.

2) Some unknown unexpected factor forced him to violate those regulations.

3) The regulations failed to protect people

Personally I suspect a mix of 2 and 3, something about that loop is weird and I know for a fact that regulation design has focused on protection the crowds at airshows not necessarily people off site (this is the first time an airshow crash has **ever** killed someone not present at the airfield). 

Hopefully the report into this incident will find the causes, it probably will, the AAIB is very very good. They will explain why this specific manoeuvre went wrong (cause 2) and hopefully suggest sensible regulation changes in light of this accident (cause 3).

I'm not going to change your mind, but I think it's fair to treat religions by how well their followers actually behave and how they implement their religion, as opposed to how great their ideology *claims* itself to be.

And by those standards - there are clearly *enormous* problems with much of Islam.  Not least being the fact that the Ahmadiyya sect is facing enormous persecution from within the Islamic world.

Honestly, I think the Ahmadiyyas are the one sect who don't deserve to be lumped in with the rest of my criticisms about Islam.  As far as I know, they're a pretty moderate group who really are able to live in peace with others.  (Although - I'm not an expert.  I'll have to find out more.)  

&gt;i can tell you being under one leadership of the Khalifa keeps lot of us in check

I think that's a fascinating point.  And it's something I wasn't aware of.  It strikes me that many of Islam's current problems are because it's a leaderless religion, and so bad ideas can go unchallenged.  Also there's a lack of responsibility when things go wrong.  Everyone can claim to be acting as an individual when it suits them and nothing ever gets sorted out.

OK - well, I'm still an atheist - so don't expect me to completely come over to your side - but I should try to find out more about the Ahmidayyas and whether they've truly managed to solve the problems besetting the rest of Islam.",null,0,null,1440367749,null,null,false,0,cud8df6,null,t3_3i4agj,null,null,null,t1_cud7vrd,null,null,null,1441428735,null,8,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

&gt;The talk about enslavement and how the government is doing this makes them sound crazy.

In the present system you're exchanging your time (labour) for fiat currency that is not backed by anything and year-on-year declines in value. As it has no backing, if it takes a tumble (like the euro), your time (labour) has been devalued and the currency has not worked as a store of value.

Dual Corsair Air Series AF120 Quiet Edition Fans.

I'm selling these due to a purchase error. 

I hope this is an acceptable [time stamp format.](http://i.imgur.com/pXOVGYE.jpg)

*The full story*

I purchased another set of fans, Corsair SP140 Performance to replace the stock fans on my recently purchase Corsair H110i GT Hydro Cooler. However I failed to realize the new fans I purchased were not PWN fans and were significantly inferior to the stock fans, they are good but they tend to rattle between 1500 and 1700rpm. Above of below that RPM and the vibration goes away.

So I replaced these fans I'm selling here (AF120) with the SP140's.

In Venezuela they have shortages because private businesses are underproducing due to the disincentive created by price caps.

null,null,lizrosemccarthy,null,null,null,"I did this for a year (East Oxford to UCL), and have a few thoughts...  
* IF you cycle to the station or don't mind the walk from East Oxford, train trumps bus for offpeak travel, almost always. Yes, it will be late from time to time but it's SO much faster. If you're taking the train, it will take you approximately 18 minutes from Paddington to your classroom (taking the circle line to Euston Square and walking really really fast). I had it down to a science - it's London, so things happen, but it went smoothly most of the time, believe it or not.  
* Get a student railcard if you can (think you have to be full time? not sure). If you book advance tickets with the railcard, you can often get them dirt cheap for off peak times.   
* I'm going to assume that you have to be in at least sometimes for 9am or so, and it's pretty much impossible to get a reasonable peak train ticket. You may decide it's worth paying the money to leave later, but the bus made more sense for me on these days. If you have to be in at 9, you usually need to be on the 6.30am bus at the latest - any later than that and you end up in too much traffic to make it. I found the X90 easiest, as then you can get off at Baker Street and take the circle line or a bus to Euston Square (or even walk). If you finish at 5ish, I find that it's worth booking it out of class and trying to get to the X90 stop by about 5.15 - you'll miss a lot of heavy traffic.  
* Although the Oxford Tube is an option, it's actually kind of hard to get to UCL from Marble Arch without a longish walk. Tottenham Court station is closed, and even that was a 15-20 minute walk...  
* Don't know if it's an option at all, but I was really lucky and was able to stay with friends one night per week, saving me quite a lot of time and money over the course of the year!

No, I don't think so.  I think that some people are more ideological than others, and Corbyn is on the extreme end.  There are plenty of politicians who are political pragmatists who don't let some tribalist ideology guide their every decision.  

&gt;I think aligning Corbyn's support of Venezuela with implication that he'd be economically incompetent is stretching it a bit.

Well, who knows what he would be like - but I'm going to support people who *don't* hold up Venezuela as some kind of socialist miracle.

Also - don't forget, it's not just Corbyn we have to deal with.  He's no doubt going to be bringing in other people from the hard-left who may not be so pleasant.  And, time and again, we've seen that Corbyn has made some very odd choices for the company he keeps.  People who support terrorism, or antisemitism.

Look - the Americans made the same mistake when they voted for  Bush.  He also seemed like a genuinely nice guy.  In fact, I think he probably *is* a nice guy.

follow this with tons of TV shows about house prices rises, buy to let, making money off property etc, to fuel the market.

take no action to stem to rise.

to what ends? well, i thought maybe its an elaborate way of getting people to be ambitious, earn more, and pay more tax. for to get a house one needs a mortgage, and to get a mortgage one needs proof of income, and get proof of income one needs to both work, and declare and pay tax on that income.

Now, I've been a postman, no problem with early starts, but I had to explain that the first bus leaves my town at 6:15, and then there's not a train to the town the offices were in til after 7, and then I'd have to walk a good 20 minutes across town as the nearer station didn't have a Sunday service.  So I could do 8, just, although if any part of my chain of public transport on Sunday services let me down, I'd likely be delayed at least half an hour.

Boss says 'Well, it's the rota, you agreed to work shifts.'

Eventually he backed down and allowed me to come in at 8 instead. 

I could understand if he didn't have about half his workforce either driving in or in walking distance of the office.  No, I had to magically change the train timetables to please him.

It was the attitude that I was somehow being 'difficult' that bugged me, as I'd already done overtime at short notice for him.

*The full story*

I purchased another set of fans, Corsair SP140 Performance to replace the stock fans on my recently purchase Corsair H110i GT Hydro Cooler. However I failed to realize the new fans I purchased were not PWN fans and were significantly inferior to the stock fans, they are good but they tend to rattle between 1500 and 1700rpm. Above of below that RPM and the vibration goes away.

So I replaced these fans I'm selling here (AF120) with the SP140's.

Par for the course for a political leader. Find me a leader who has not done similar. [Here's a recent one from Cameron](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/11685029/David-Cameron-invites-Egypts-Sisi-to-London-after-Morsi-death-sentence.html).

On the wider point though is it not good political discourse to engage in dialogue with a wide range of people with differing opinions?

&gt; People who support terrorism, or antisemitism.

Guilt by association again. Is Corbyn an antisemitic terrorist supporter? Our government are happy to share platforms with regimes who suppress democracy and women's rights and actively endorse their regime's stability/trade or whatever else they can spin to a positive.

&gt; He's no doubt going to be bringing in other people from the hard-left who may not be so pleasant.
