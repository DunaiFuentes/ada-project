null,false,going_dicey,null,null,null,"What you linked is social housing. Anything operating under a shared ownership scheme is social housing (ran by a housing association). Typically a portion of these flats will be partially owned by people similar to you (good wages, but not able to afford the area outright). Another portion will be let out to the same type of tenant who'd qualify for traditional council housing. Another portion could even be stock used as temporary housing for the council. I personally think shared ownership schemes are terrible ideas for the following reason:

A) You are buying into a quasi-council estate. There can be anti-social behaviour attached. Shared ownership housing is not exempt from this anti-social behaviour. Not saying this is a problem for me, but its one to be aware of. Also note that resale value of council housing can be up to 30% less than market rate. More on resale value of shared ownership at point D, but also note that shared ownership can face similar resale value issues as council housing.

B) Shared ownership build quality is usually terrible. When a developer seeks planning permission, they usually must allot circa 25% towards 'affordable housing' (this is a codeword-- do not confuse 'affordable housing' with housing that is actually affordable). The portions of the building assigned for this shared ownership scheme will be of a lesser quality because the builder will sell it all in bulk to a housing association.  

C. You don't own the damn home. You own a portion of it and pay rent in the portion you don't own. That means you capture the negatives of both renting and owning. You pay maintenance costs and you pay rent.

D. When it comes time to sell, you will not make money. You'll be lucky to break even. You will be required to seek permission from the housing association to sell the property. Once they grant permission, they will be very vocal in what price it can be sold at and who it can be sold too. You will not be selling into a free market. You will be selling into a controlled market.

Finally, and I say this with the utmost respect...do yourself a huge favour and don't even consider a 5% deposit mortgage. That's just plain stupid. It does not make sense over renting, financially, provided you rent intelligently. Pop some numbers into a rent vs. buy calculator and you will see that the interest rates + risk of having 95% of your home leveraged just does not make sense.

With a home you will need to devote 5% of the home value to various closing costs (SDLT, conveyancing fees, valuation, mortgage booking fee, etc.). These closing costs, generally, cannot be paid with a loan. Your annual maintenance on a home will be circa 1% of the value. YOU have to replace the boiler. YOU have to fix the roof.

People say renting is throwing money away. But don't forget half your mortgage payment will be interest (higher on these ridiculously leveraged mortgage products) for half the term of the loan. In fact, in the lifetime of the 5% deposit mortgage you will actually be paying double the value of the mortgage over the term. Owning a home is nice and all. But there is a lot of cost that is literally 'thrown away'.

* BTL landlords get the poor tenant to pay off the mortgage for them, or the cost of buying the house, and then they get the house to sell at a later date for today's insane prices - it's not like an owner occupier that has paid for the house themselves - so arguably the BTL landlord actually does get a much better return. In some cases they additionally get some of the monthly rental as immediate pure profit
* BTL in general has contributed to the housing shortage (and before someone inevitably points out, it is one factor and not the only one), boosting prices and inflating rents.

2. BTL in general provides roofs to many people as social housing has shrunk and property investors have filled the gap vacated by government and councils.... Not only that but landlords have to get 20-25% deposit, residential just 5%. Thats just £6-7k for a new build ""Up north""...
... Landlords are not leaving the properties empty - how does it contribute to the housing shortage.

A faulty wheelbearing would have given weeks if not months of notice that it needed doing. 

You got what you deserved for spending the last 6 months ignoring the droning it was doing every time you turned a corner and then when it got to the point it did it all the time.

I find it quite ironic you complain about the mechanic coming pretty close to having a crash when you've spent the last couple of months quite happily driving a car about with a wheel that could potentially part company with the car and probably at quite a lot higher speeds than the mechanic was doing.

Doesn't change the fact that private tenants are handing over several hundred quid a month. Where is it going? That the landlord chooses not to use it to pay down the mortgage is neither here nor there - but that they could if they wanted.

&gt; Landlords are not leaving the properties empty - how does it contribute to the housing shortage.

Except that it does create a shortage if you want to buy - so that you don't end up renting forever. Can't buy because you can't get a house or you can't afford one now due to the shortage pushing prices up, but you can rent from people who bought the houses up, and pay off their mortgage instead of the one you could have got had there been enough houses and not a BTL craze

It does; as what you said is false. Stick by your guns by all means.

&gt;Can't buy because you can't get a house

Just bought one; had to save £7k deposit. A landlord would need £28k. Then would have to keep their offer low; to ensure ""rental yield"" covers monthly mortgage - bearing in mind interest rates are higher for landlords.

So yer - landlords are highly disadvantaged in the market. On a 1v1. Except your original argument is landlords are making loads of money when selling.

&gt;due to the shortage

So are landords making profits by selling or not?

By the way; first time buyers is highest its been since 2007. Im getting you've been reading too much into left-wing press - housing shortage is caused by:

1. inactive social housing sector; glorified letting agents.
2. land banking
3. lack of finance to build

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"I can entirely understand that there exists a line of thought in which nuclear weapons are unjustifiable relics that have no place in the modern world, and regardless of what other nations do we ought to set a moral example by unilaterally disarming. I disagree with the logic entirely, but I can see how one could arrive at that conclusion. 

Having said that, I can't understand SNP policy on Trident at all. They want to get rid of trident (boo, hiss, evil trident... right there on the Clyde, because you know, it's a target or something supposedly...). All the whilst they simultaneously support NATO. Now I do appreciate that most countries in NATO are not nuclear armed... but it's essentially a nuclear defense alliance. Being in NATO is, by extension, to morally sanction the use of nuclear weapons in defense of each others nation. By being in NATO, you are authorizing the US, the UK or France to use their nuclear weapons on your behalf in defense of all members.

To put it in context, being in NATO and wanting to unilaterally disarm is a bit like being in ISIS but not really *""believing in that whole Islam thing""*... It's an awkward juxtaposition between purporting to support the moral highground, whilst simultaneously supporting the very thing you purport to oppose. To me it just demonstrates that SNP policy is fundamentally populist... they support NATO because its membership is popular in Scotland, they oppose trident because it's been made into a bogeyman in Scotland. They support ending austerity because austerity is unpopular in Scotland. They support spending cuts through Full Fiscal Autonomy because the idea of FFA is popular in Scotland. Their entire party is out for one thing... to win the confidence of Scotland so they can either unilaterally secede from the UK or hold (and win) another referendum on independence. They will say or do anything they can in support of it, and as a result their manifesto is just a hodge-podge of painful contradictions.

It's not that they're lying per se, it's that they don't know how they will achieve their goals. This is something that has been very clear in interviews and debates involving Natalie Bennett. She states lots of aims but few objectives and that has made me lose confidence in both her and the party. In other words, she doesn't seem like she knows what she is doing and if she ever got into office she would need to re-asses her position on a hell of a lot of her unrealistic policies in order to make it work.

Now compare this to Nigel Farage who has very strong objectives (One in particular is a clearly outlined plan to leave the EU in order to control immigration) but his party's aims are loosely defined  hence why people accuse the party of xenophobia (i.e. He is basing his aims on the possible outcome of reduced immigration; but leaving the EU and controlling immigration may not solve all of the problems he says it will and it will likely create new ones that his party hasn't forseen or simply chosen to ignore).

Looks like that was the amount of National Insurance (NI) contributions you paid, assuming you were an employee and your employer was automatically taking taxes/NI out of your pay-packet, which is standard. Your payslip will list NI contributions if your employer was deducting them automatically. NI is separate to income tax. The PT is the threshold above which you start paying NI contributions (like income tax, if you don't earn enough you don't pay NI and the first £x per week is exempt).

According to this page, it seems like Canadians could carry on paying the equivalent of Canadian NI instead of UK NI if you have some sort of certificate. Presumably you didn't have that arrangement? I don't didn't know anything about this before finding this page and don't know whether it's usual to pay Canadian contributions instead.

&gt;__St Albans Cathedral__, formally known as the __Cathedral and Abbey Church of St Alban__, is a [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England) cathedral [church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_(building\)) within [St Albans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans), [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England). At 84 metres (276 ft),  its [nave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nave) is the longest of any [cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral) in England. With much of its present architecture dating from [Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans) times, it was formerly known as __St Albans Abbey__ before it became a [cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral) in 1877. It is the second longest cathedral in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) (after [Winchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Cathedral)). Local residents often call it ""the abbey"", although the present cathedral represents only the church of the old [Benedictine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine) abbey.

- Thanks to the feedback on the women prison policy, there is planned to be a vote on it in the autumn conference. Generally though, in regard to prisons and justice has a whole, the Green Party plan to make it more equal, and to reduce the overall prison population. I do admit though that this policy does need revising.

- In regards to Nuclear power, this has been open to wide debate within the Green Party. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/greenpartyanswers/comments/2z448q/why_are_you_against_nuclear_power/) thread covers the core views over this issue (some standing for a decentralised and more renewables solution, whilst others advocate for advancing our nuclear research and resources).

Aside from the Citizens Income, I would highly doubt that these policies become core points for the Green Party and what they stand for in their manifesto. The Green Party are mostly focusing on the NHS, the Economy, Homes, Education and Transport as part of their current campaign.

Quite frankly Cameron has everything to lose, for not only himself, losing the PMship, but also his party as a whole, while he is always getting elected as an MP, his artificially created resolute stance of a leader, could sway the swing voters to vote in their respective constituencies, and any blunder could achieve the exact opposite.

Everyday on the tube people get in more of a scuffle trying to get on and off than what happened in this video. It is just the fact these people are clearly just a bunch of cunts that is the problem, but I don't think being a cunt is illegal. 

Lets put it this way, it isn't assault, he doesn't threaten him, it could technically be battery because he does knock into him and he does fall, but to quote wikipedia (however relevant that might be): ""Battery involves unlawfully touching another person (this does not include everyday knocks and jolts to which people silently consent as the result of crowds)."" Now he clearly isn't in a crowd, but this could easily be classed as a everyday knock or jolt, in this situation he gets slightly knocked, stumbles, stumbles again and can't regain his balance, if also inebriated in any way, that could be the cause here, and one would argue that someone so unstable permanently would probably be carrying a cane for walking.

This of course will be tried in the court of public opinion, and the only reason any criminal proceeding will occur is due to pubic outcry, as being a dickhead isn't a crime.

Edit: What is even the point in having a discussion section on this subreddit, why not just have a circlejerk button, apparently anyone who want to actually talk about the actual legal standing of the issue gets downvoted by a bunch of idiots who couldn't even attempt to use their tiny brains to assess evidence from a legal perspective.

Poch has nearly invariably played the exact same starting XI week on week since fairly early in his reign.  Players like Mason, Chadli and Dier can have entirely off matches for long stretches and he still persists with the same personnel.

With the triple whammy of losing the LC final, getting knocked out of Europa and then having some crummy EPL results knocking the wind out of 4th place, there's little for the team to play for, and even less when your position is never contested.  How many poor matches does Eriksen need to have before Poch is gonna consider giving him a rest?

Chelsea are motivated because they've got a title within their grasp.  And besides, they did suffer in the Champions League for not rotating enough.

Of course this is entirely true, being a moron doesn't make you above the law just because of your own idiocy. 

&gt;  should the drunken idiot have foreseen that his stumbling around in a chaotic manner could have resulted in an injury to someone on the street?

Indeed, but if you are arresting him you are arresting the entire town centre of every major city on a Saturday night. 

I was considering breach of the peace, but really that is an offence to remove people who are acting in a disorderly manner from the area and not an actual criminal charge, the charge would be assault, or battery, or drunk and disorderly. It is just an all encompassing phrase to remove someone from the scene quickly and isn't applicable here.

There is also no failure to provide assistance law in the UK and, as is quite apparent, assistance is already being provided by other people and this prick is in no place to be providing it anyway. 

You can then look at section 5 of the public order act, but even that is a stretch, it all revolves around intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress, now this action could easily be encompassed in that, but it does rely on the ""intent or awareness"" that the behaviour might be disorderly and it is a stretch given the technical definition of disorderly to even class it as so, disorderly behaviour normally requires provoking, harassing or distressing someone, the aftermath is distressing but the action is mundane, it is the outcome that is distressing and the response to the outcome that is disgusting.  

So what does fill this role you ask, the court of public opinion, yes they wrote it into law, the Outraging the Pubic Decency law:


-     the act was of such a lewd character as to outrage public decency; this element constitutes the nature of the act, which has to be proved before the offence can be established, and
-    the act took place in a public place and must have been capable of being seen by two or more persons who were actually present, even if they did not actually see it.

And to add to its all encompassing nature it is punishable by an unlimited prison sentence or unlimited fine.

null,false,TranslatedComment,null,null,null,"&gt; Supermarkets save government money by reducing number on unemployment benefits.

Actually, it's the opposite when it comes to benefits. The largest number of people who claim benefits are people in work and claim housing benefit.

If you're working for a supermarket and you're on minimum wage at around 30-40 hours a week, you're most likely entitled to housing benefit, council tax benefit, and working tax credit. Not the full amount, but you will be entitled to a discount.

And those are just the ones for single people with no kids. If you have a partner and/or kids, the eligibility for benefits differs, typically involving a reduced amount of hours to be approved for those benefits.

This is why a lot of people are pushing for what's called ""a living wage"". It's a wage, typically around £8-£9 an hour depending on region, that would mean that anyone working over 35 hours a week would not need to claim any benefits.

Supermarkets that pay below this rate for workers on 40 hours a week or less are actively subsidising their employees wages with government benefits. 

Supermarkets like keeping people on low hours because it means they pay less in national insurance contributions towards those employees, and less tax, and they don't have to provide a pension scheme for people who work under a certain number of hours (the pension scheme might have changed recently with the introduction of a new law that came in this month).

A lot of these factors combined means people find themselves dependant on these jobs, mainly because they can't find other full time work, and also can't find other part time work that also allows them to carry on working around the hours from their first job.

http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ec.html#EC730

&gt; It will not be subject to means testing and there will be no requirement to be either working or actively seeking work.

^ That's why it won't work, because in the current political climate, it will never pass.

A basic income that replaces benefits like JSA/DLA/Pensions, etc is reasonable and would probably pass if we lower the initial amount and then push it up after a few years, but trying to pass a law like this where people get money for doing nothing simply won't be voted through. There are far too many petty minded people who have the opinion that ""I work for my money, why should they get it for free?"". **Even though they would get the same amount**.

People, as a group, are often quite stupid, petty minded, and will vote against their own best needs on a regular basis.

It's pretty easy to see how the media will spin the vote against this policy. Why should scroungers do nothing and get free money? Why should we encourage people to not work? etc.

There's also the argument of why we're giving money to people who are working in the first place. If we're giving the same amount of money to people who are working, why do they need the same amount that unemployed people need? Do we need to pay working people less, or unemployed people more?

We're already have similar discussions about the level of benefits in regards to council tax with people on benefits. The government are saying that these benefits are what the law says is the bare minimum you need to survive, yet many local councils are now requiring people on benefits to pay towards their yearly council tax bill. So which one is right? Should your entire council tax bill be paid for while on full benefits, or should you be required to pay towards it?

And then we've not even touched on pensions and pensioners. The 12million strong group most likely to vote, and in large numbers, will have a huge issue with a massive new cost that will certainly affect their pensions in the coming years. At least, that's what the Daily Mail will tell them.

There is more info about it at the bottom of [this article.](http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/01/uk-green-partys-basic-income-proposal-scrutinized-experts/)

&gt; SECOND UPDATE: Malcolm Torry has shed further light on this subject, saying, “The Guardian made an assumption that the Green Party scheme was the same as the scheme that the Citizen’s Income Trust published in its introductory booklet 2013. But the Green Party had not published the details of its scheme, so this was not a valid assumption. The CIT scheme does generate losses, although mainly small ones. This is why we did some more research, which was published in an Institute for Economic and Social Research working paper in September 2014. This shows that it is possible to implement a CI of £72 per week which doesn’t generate losses, but only if residual means-tested benefits are retained and a household’s CIs are taken into account when their means-tested benefits are calculated. What the Green Party will put in its manifesto we still don’t know. For the avoidance of doubt: There is no conflict between the Citizen’s Income Trust and the Green Party. Links to the relevant publications can be found at the top of the home page of our website, www.citizensincome.org”

Malcolm Torry is the CIT director.

Also, on your point re the policy about Women's prisons - I do agree that this should be gender-neutral, with science-based rehabilitation/preventation always coming before punishment. However, I think, the fact that it states women does not mean that the green party believes men are incapable of rehabilitation.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"I know /u/asteroid_9's post was two days ago (which is an eternity on Reddit. Lol.) but I have been on this subbreddit for a number of years (yes, years!) and felt I should drop in my opinion on the matter.

First off, yah, I wish there was more in-depth discussion, yah, I wish there were higher quality posts. And, yah, for those of you have seen my posts, I tend to be long-winded (as a bit of a writer, I do enjoy more long-form posts; though, I'm not above the frustrated ""FUCK OFF"" in a match thread. Haha) and I enjoy writing more in-depth posts.

However, I do not think we need a separate subreddit for a variety of reasons including:

* As much of a ""fuckin' student"" as I might be, I can't shake the feeling that there is an elitist nature to a subreddit only focused on ""higher quality"" posts. ""Only *smart* people go to *that* sub.""
* And then there's the definition of what ""high-quality"" and ""in-depth discussion"" really is; Who decides that? Me? You? And what happens when *that* subreddit is deemed ""low quality,"" do we split again?
* There's just a sheer laziness issue for me; I go to /r/Soccer and /r/LiverpoolFC frequently and I don't think I'll go to yet another subreddit to talk football and Liverpool FC.

***

I am proud and happy with the growth of our subreddit. I remember years and years ago when there were only a dozen of us who actually posted regularly. I honestly don't care about Reddit Karma, but just as an example of growth, I would post a link years ago and I'd get about 20-30 Karma and these days a similar post will generate 50+ points with relative ease.

That being said, yah, with growth also comes a wider variety of opinions, demographics, etc. With 27,000 subscribers (think about that: *27,000!!!!*), you're going to get a portion of people who are new supporters, old grizzled cynical supporters, people who like GIFs and Memes, people who like in-depth discussion and people who like to upvote a ""Happy Birthday Coutinho!!!"" post. [*Shrug*]. It happens.

***

So, what now?

Tags seem to be the most popular suggestion. But I don't really like it.

I know many people like tags and it's a nice idea but I don't think we would be able to effectively execute a widespread use of tags because - considering the size of our sub - it would be hard to implement. Then you get petty arguments about how this should be tagged this or that and then the petty defensive argument that tags are silly, etc. etc.

Now, if people started to organically use tags and it evolved that way? Then, yah, that's fine. But, again, I think it would be difficult for mods to implement that rule. And besides, if the mods implement it strictly, it's a waste of time for them to police the subreddit while others will complain the subreddit is being policed to heavily (or not heavily enough). But if the tags are not policed, then why bother with tags if we're not going to enforce it?

Therefore: I don't like the idea of tags.

***

I think the simple answer is to just demand more from ourselves and maybe a bit more from the mods.

* Don't like the Karma-whore posts? Downvote, hide (that's what I do), and move on.
* If you think there's not enough high-quality discussion then maybe the OP needs to look at themselves to see if they are writing posts that actually encourage and generate high-quality discussion.
* Or maybe one shouldn't sit back and say, ""I won't bother trying to add high-quality discussion because this subreddit is full of children"" and simply continue posting what they feel is high-quality discussion and hope that other people who enjoy those sorts of posts will upvote and/or respond in like-kind.
* Finally, I think mods should be a bit more involved in encouraging high-quality posts. But, more importantly to me, I think mods should be more involved in consolidating threads that discuss the same thing. And the acceptance that it is the mods discretion to close/consolidate a thread without any need for silly discussions splitting hairs about why this post is different from that post.
* For example, maybe find a way to close a self-post about, say, the new kit and post a comment that directs people to a thread where conversation about the kit is already happening. Like, why is does the ""I... I like the new kit"" post exist? I mean, it's not a bad post, I don't mind it, but isn't that conversation already happening in multiple kit threads already? (I like the new kits, btw).

***

So, in conclusion, my opinion is:

* No split.
* No tags.
* Write better posts; Encourage others to write better posts; Or write better comments in allegedly ""shit posts."" Upvote/downvote, hide.
* More mod involvement to curb redundant threads (ex. only one birthday post is necessary, only one highlight of so-and-so's goal is necessary, etc. etc.).

Doesn't fit the system? I don't necessarily believe that is a big turn off. Unlike, say, a defender or a midfielder, there is relatively far less need to adjust an entire tactical philosophy around a striker like Zlatan. Tactically-speaking, I'd argue that *any* manager or squad will be happy to accommodate a Zlatan.

So, the argument of ""he wouldn't fit our system"" doesn't carry as much weight with me.

Therefore, in a vacuum, I would love Zlatan in a red shirt.

However, we don't exist in a vacuum and, as many have pointed out, there are clear business and long-term strategy hurdles to actually getting Zlatan:

* Transfer fee.
* Wages.

Obviously, it is quite unrealistic to think that PSG would accept a reasonable transfer fee, it is quite unrealistic to think that Zlatan has this overwhelming desire to prove himself in the Premier League and in a Liverpool shirt and accepting club-friendly wages to do so.

And, most importantly to me, I have to ask myself the question: ""Are we a Zlatan away?""

No, I don't think we are a Zlatan away.

I'd rather worry about locking up our core group of players, continuing to encourage and improve our youth to step up, get the most out of players who are at the cusp of breaking out, adding/subtracting solid players throughout our future transfer windows.

And then maybe we'll get to a point where we are a ""Zlatan away.""

As it stands now, Zlatan is a cherry-on-top for the biggest of clubs poised to win titles and Champions League trophies (Chelsea, Man City, Real Madrid, Barcelona, etc) and an unnecessary luxury for clubs like ours especially considering Zlatan is 33-years-old.

That being said, I think we're only a few seasons away from actually seriously considering a player of Zlatan's caliber.",null,0,null,1428811197,null,0,false,0,cq9hqp8,null,t3_32a119,null,t1_cq9hqp8,null,t3_32a119,null,null,null,1432341345,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

You know how much of a struggle it is for someone to move to live in the USA from another country? Well, it's even harder for someone from the U.S. to live legally in the UK.  Without specialist skills, getting a work visa in the UK is incredibly difficult - an employer has to prove they can't find anyone else from the EU to fill a post - and then they have to go through the hassle and expense of sponsoring you. Without a valid work visa an employer risks prosecution and fines.  

Below is the skills shortage list - if you have shortage skills you may be in luck - it's much easier to sponsor someone with these skills.

Otherwise, you could get a job in a U.S. firm that has offices in the UK and transfer over.  Or you could come over to go to university (not cheap compared to in-state education). Or you could marry a UK citizen. If you have any family connections to a EU country you may be able to claim an ancestry visa.  

Please do not just turn up and hope for the best. As an illegal immigrant you could not access free medical help and will most likely find yourself homeless in a strange country.

The second policy is based on the recommendations of the [Corston report](http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/projectsresearch/women/corstonreport) and focuses on the implementation of their recommendations. The policy isn't based on the fact that women should be treated differently to men on account of being a different gender, but that women criminals are less likely to commit more serious crimes, are more likely to suffer from mental illnesses and are also more likely to self harm while in prison. Overall this means that women criminals on average would be easier to rehabilitate without the need for prison when compared with male criminals. Though it's worth noting that they want to reduce the prison population for both genders as a whole.

Finally the [Green policy](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ey.html#EN261) on nuclear is different than what is being described in the piece. They're not opposing all usage of nuclear energy currently but only the building of newer plants, because it'll be too slow meet our energy needs and will cost more than comparable sources.

In the hands of a freshly qualified driver however it is a means of going 120mph and getting there relatively quickly, that's a big risk for a young male driver in the eyes of an insurer.  You can do plenty of damage in a little punto, there's no denying that, but the rationale of pricing young drivers out of more powerful cars is pretty sound. 

Don't get me wrong, at 17 in a 1.2 litre clio (my first car) I was a lot more willing to take risks and drive like a dickhead than I am now in vastly more powerful vehicles but the insurers will have done their sums and determined that the less powerful hatchbacks in the hands of young drivers cost them less in claims.  I don't mean to sound condescending or anything like that but the fact is young guys are a fucking liability when it comes to insurers bottom line, that's why you're paying so much.

Just suck it up until you're 25 and then drive pretty much whatever takes your fancy, keep a spotless record with no claims until then and you'll quickly find that your insurance cost pretty much drops to the point it's of no real concern.   You might get unlucky and get into a smash, sometimes there's no avoiding it, but you can still have fun in a little low powered car and really what matters is the fact you have independent transport available and even though it's not the fastest car on the roads doesn't really matter when you think of all the benefits that are now available to you.

And for what it's worth there's a lot to be said for an economical little hatchback, as much as I miss my big 2.5L Subaru I'm now getting a lot more miles to my pounds in a little 1.6L Focus, eventually that does become a concern when you start commuting etc.  At least these days the little hatchbacks have the option of turbochargers etc. with their small engines, that's something we never had.  Look into diesels if you really cant stomach the thought of an 80hp car, the extra torque of a diesel in a small, light hatchback can be a lot of fun and the insurance is often the same as the lower powered petrol equivalent.

&gt; 

No it isn't, it is a annualised levy on non realised assets. Taxes like that are a cancer. Its like asking someone who owns stocks &amp; shares, but hasn't sold them and so hasn't realised any gain, to pay a tax on the present value.

It is being levied because people are likely to be able to pay it, not because it is fair, just like VED. Its proportionality of cost is not aimed at stopping people hurting the environment but an algorithm to determine the consumers likelihood to be able to pay. 

What the ""mansion tax"" will do is hilarious.

However a brief mention of the type of ""work visa"" you might be able to get will give you some indication of how realistic your goals are (if you're serious about this, you will probably want to budget ten years and between $50,000 - $100,000 spent to enable you to make the move). That's because the only visas realistically available to US citizens are:

1. Skilled employee visa. To get one of these you must apply for a job at a British company where that job is one of the occupations on the [Government's shortage occupation list](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/420284/Shortage_Occupation_List_-_April_2015.pdf). Note that simply being qualified to do one of those jobs probably isn't good enough, you will most likely need several years of experience at doing the job already before you'll be accepted.

2. Intra-company transfer. For this you need to be working for a company which has offices in both the USA and the UK.  After working there for a minimum of six months you can ask to be transferred to one of their UK sites. Obviously you need to be good enough at your job to convince the company to spend approximately $10,000 (over and above your salary) filling in the appropriate forms and paperwork and arranging the move.

3. Marriage to an EU citizen. Note that simply marrying an EU citizen isn't enough -- that person will need to have been earning at least £18,6000 p.a. for six months before the marriage, otherwise you will not get a spousal visa to come and join them. There are ways around this requirement (google for Surinder Singh) but that's a legal minefield and if you make a single mistake then again you won't get the visa.

And that's about it. There are of course various other visas available for people to come to the UK but they're even more obscure and difficult to get than the three listed above.",null,0,null,1428821762,null,0,false,0,cq9ljet,null,t3_32avl2,null,t1_cq9ljet,null,t1_cq9l2mi,null,null,null,1432343135,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

Mobile phone bill: £50

Other bills that could be applicable to you depending on your situation are credit cards, car bills, how much you want to spend on fun, gym memberships. I with agree with MDKrouzer about £300 for bills which leaves you a bit tight so make sure you have a safety net for emergencies, for example I have a £215 dental bill (NHS) due next month which was a bit of a surprise.

You picked out one policy (Citizen's Income) which they aren't going to implement in the next parliament anyway, and another (the prison policy) that is incredibly unlikely to ever become party policy and which most party members (including leadership) probably don't even know exists. And Bennett has set out her reasons for opposing nuclear power [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2uez88/i_am_natalie_bennett_leader_of_the_green_party_of/co7t7zj) and I think she actually makes some good points worth bearing in mind:

&gt;There’s also cost issues - but the big one for me is that nuclear is slow to get approval and build: way too slow for the urgency of our energy needs or our need to cut carbon emissions.

&gt;Solar energy is taking off and costs are plummeting, there’s exciting developments in tidal power, e.g. starting with the Swansea Bay lagoon proposal that’s part of a scheme set to provide 9% of the UK’s electricity demand via tidal in ten years—and hopefully we’ll soon get serious about energy conservation, which would also tackle fuel poverty.

It just feels a bit dishonest. What you should really be focusing on are their actual policies for this election: if you want to tackle their just-announced 60% top rate of tax, go for it. If you want to talk about their policies in building homes, again, go for it.

What paper does he read?! I first head of TTIP in a newspaper (The Economist, and later The Financial Times).  Since then, I've seen in The Telegraph and The Guardian.  It's been covered by the BBC, but that's not a paper.

&gt; has anyone received an insightful reply from their MP?

There isn't much to understand at this stage vis-a-vis TTIP.  It's a still in negotiation and consequently, we don't know what the end result will be.  Of course, this means that replies can't really be very insightful.

Despite this we have a few documents that set the case for TTIP and explain its potential in some detail:

[This is a response by the Government to the House of Lords](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/329716/42014-Cm-8907-Transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership.pdf).  It may be a little more detailed than what you get from your MP (I skimmed through it - it looks informative).

[Here's a summary of the important bits](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership-ttip-benefits-and-concerns).

Remember that since this is being discussed at EU level you have representation in the European Parliament.  You can address questions to you representative there.  [You can find your representative here](http://www.europarl.org.uk/en/your_meps.html).

&gt;  Is it as bad as it seems?

That depends.  It looks good to me.  You probably mean all the FUD being thrown about regarding the NHS and so on so forth.  The EU Trade Commissioner has repeatedly said that public services are not at risk.  The question has been asked of our government too and they've said the same.

[Here is a helpful brochure from the EU Trade Commissioner](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2015/march/tradoc_153266.pdf).

[Here's is their more substantial FAQ](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/about-ttip/questions-and-answers/index_en.htm).

You might be concerned about ISDS.  [Here's a UK Government brochure explaining it](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311247/bis-14-695-investor-state-dispute-settlement-faqs.pdf).  Let me point out that since 1975, 94 trade agreements have been signed.  Almost all have ISDS provisions.  If I recall correctly, the UK Government was taken to ISDS courts twice.  It never lost in ISDS arbitration.

[Here's a list of publications by the government regarding TTIP](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership-ttip).  If you read them, you could come to one of two conclusions:

1. TTIP could be hugely beneficial and is worth a shot.
2. There is some huuuuge conspiracy.  Everyone is lying: The EU Commission, the European Parliament, our Government, most of the press.  We can only believe people who don't know what the final document will say, but claim to know what will happen.


At the end of the day, TTIP will be voted on by the European Parliament, 28 national parliaments of the member states and has to go through the US congress.  There will be plenty of public scrutiny and opportunity for review when (if?) the agreement is finalised.  You can rest assured that with such a wide scope, it will have to please everyone so it can't be as controversial as some will have you believe.  If it were, it would be voted down in at least 1 of 29 countries. 


**Is there a government organisation to address concerns to?**

If you have questions about EU Trade you can address the to the Trade Commission. [Here are instructions on doing that.](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/trade-policy-and-you/contacts/).

If you feel a burning desire to get in contact directly with the Trade Commissioner, [here is her page and contact information](http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/malmstrom_en).

TTIP seems to be handled by the [Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-innovation-skills).

EU business on a more local level is handled by the FCO (more specifically by the Minister of State for Europe).

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"I wont be voting green because I want to see these policies. Let's face it, it isn't going to happen. But what are my alternatives?

I consider myself to have left of centre social and economic views (Boo! Hiss!) so I was never going to vote Conservative or UKIP. I'll be voting in England, so my choices are now Labour, the Liberal Democrats or the Greens. 

1) Labour are very much a centrist party, even economically right wing in quite a few areas. They aren't a *bad* party to vote for but by giving them my vote I reinforce the idea that the Labour party needs to aggressively occupy the middle ground, which in the past has meant the privatisation of public services and assets that I don't think should have been privatised. They are also fairly keen to distance themselves from the idea that as a socialist government they will intervene in the free market, which is something I *absolutely* want to see over the next few years if I am ever to start buying a house. And whilst failing (in my eyes) to intervene enough economically, I think they are far too happy to intervene socially; they have a horrendous record for eroding civil liberties and I don't want to encourage that any further by endorsing it at the ballot box. 

2) The Lib Dems do have a much more progressive stance on civil liberties and I think their social policies are fair enough for me to consider voting for them. Obviously they wont be re-nationalising the railways any time soon but I could live with that if they were able to deliver a more equal society. Unfortunately, I am very much unimpressed by their performance during the last five years in government. They made several promises in their 2010 election manifesto before then voting the opposite way -and no, being in a coalition is not a valid excuse in my eyes. They were elected to represent people who agreed with the policies outlined in their manifesto and then behaved differently once in Westminster. As far as I'm concerned it's an insult to representative democracy and I don't think it should go unpunished. They may have prevented a few of the nastier Conservative policies getting through, but they still enabled a (in my opinion) harmful Conservative government when they really had no requirement to. I would have much preferred it if the Lib Dems had gone into opposition and supported the Tories ad-hoc on policies they actually agreed with (or even just got themselves a better deal when entering the coalition). 

3) The Greens have some batshit insane policies but they can promise the moon on a stick because they aren't going to get a sniff of power. I wouldn't vote Green because I wanted to see Trident scrapped in the next parliamentary term (I don't by the way), I would vote Green to split the vote from the main two contenders in my constituency and demonstrate that 1) I don't want Labour or the Conservatives to represent me in Westminster, so I'm not going legitimise that representation by endorsing your candidate at the election and 2) I really feel I should have more that two choices when it comes to general elections. The FPTP system is shameful, and I'm going to do my bit to try and break it. The Greens are a fairly radical left wing party, which I don't necessarily think is a good thing, but it might squeeze Labour away from the middle ground if it sees a market for the left wing vote. 

Whatever I do, the representative in my constituency will be a Labour or Conservative candidate. I would prefer Labour to be honest; not because I strongly agree with them, but just because I agree with them more than the Conservatives. By voting Labour though, I endorse a system that I fundamentally disagree with. If I vote for the fringe party, there is a chance that the pitfalls of FPTP will be addressed when it becomes clear that none of the traditional parties will see support significantly above 30% ever again, and that their democratic mandate for forming government becomes tenuous. When I have a real choice of who to vote for (i.e. when there is some form of proportional representation), or when there is such a stark contrast between the two contenders that I really am compelled to vote for the lesser of two evils, then I will give due consideration to voting for the party who I think can give me the best future.

What wouldn't go away is the debts (loans etc) owed to the bank on its balance sheet. These would still exist, be sold off cheaply and recovered by another bank so everyone who owed them money would have no change in their assets and debts.

Whether or not it would actually solve anything is another question, I personally think what we need is a limit to salary vs position in a company. E.g. If you are at the top of your company and there are 10 levels below you, should only earn (10+x)*the lowest salary. X being a number which I haven't worked out yet.

People who earn £150,000 a year don't tend to be who reddit imagines. Quite often they are people like very senior headteachers,  doctors, lawyers, engineers etc. Basically they are everyday normal people who are at the peak of a professional career. They only tend to earn salaries like that for 5-10 years right before they retire and its a mark of the fact they've simply come so far in their profession. 

The big bag evil bankers that we all love to hate don't tend to get paid *salaries* like this though... people who earn above £150K tend to do it in more abstract ways... for example a salary of say £120K, an annual cash bonus of £30K, shares worth £50k, a company credit card with a very generous limit and a very expensive executive company car. 

Basically my point is, measures like this won't actually end up taxing many people. Those people they do tax are probably not the people you want it to tax... they're the bloody honest-do-gooders who've done really well for themselves. 

I understand it's painful for all of us to see such a small number of people ingratiate themselves with such a large piece of the pie... but I'm not sure a simplistic measure like this will go any ways to addressing it... and I think the green party pursuing this is little more than populist campaigning.

She basically increased tax on everyone while lowering it for a small number of very rich people, which /u/maverixx99 is passing off as a sign rich people were avoiding tax less.

I mean, that doesn't even make sense. Most of the income from the top bracket comes from the very rich anyway, and the difference in tax rate wouldn't be big enough to mean paying the tax was cheaper than hiring an accountant just because their income in the top bracket was hundreds of thousands of pounds anyway.

When some of their MLAs have openly admitted to being beholden to the doctrine of the Free P church, people are not voting for fair representation.

As has been said in here already, people need to differentiate when it comes to ""Ulster Unionist"" as the UUP don't tend to have a policy on such issues, but they're basically the Tories in disguise so their members will vote as you would expect.  There's a difference between being conservative, which is your right, and being a bigot.

An interesting point op made is that the DUP seem so averse to British policies.  Their opinions on marriage and abortion willfully keep us in line with the Republic, which makes no sense.

What I would ask people is they keep a level head on their shoulders and remember just how unrepresentative politicians are these days.  The culture of the far right had been effectively stamped out of mainland Britain but we only need to look at the trends to know it's still there.  And (as flawed as vox pop surveys inherently are) the Belfast Tele recently found that there is majority support for extending the 1967 Abortion Act to NI (*more* than current support for the act in England).

null,false,Hhhaamuus,null,null,null,"&gt;The big bag evil bankers that we all love to hate don't tend to get paid salaries like this though...

Yes they absolutely do, because we have specifically brought in laws which means to maximise their income they need to earn a higher base. Even their share payouts are based on their basic.

&gt;or example a salary of say £120K

Taxed at 20 and then 40.

&gt;an annual cash bonus of £30K, 

Taxed at 40.

&gt;shares worth £50k

Already highly restricted, this would not be possible.

An employer can give anyone £3.6k free shares a year.

Then they can give you up to £1.8k additional shares (bought out of your salary) plus 2 shares for each of these.

You can then use **the dividends** from these shares to buy more provided you don't sell them for 3 years.

There is nobody earning 120k basic who gets 50k shares. Before dividend shares they can get a max of 9k in shares. I think you have a core misunderstanding of the system.

You can also just buy 30k shares, out of your salary, which requires a higher base. You only avoid the tax and NI on the earnings you get from them, not on the initial value.

So even with using both of those schemes, max share options are 39k, and a lot of that has come out of taxed salary.

&gt;a company credit card with a very generous limit and a very expensive executive company car.

Very easy to audit expenses and see if any of them were benefit-in-kind. The car you can't do much about, unless they can't justify needing it. E.g. banker working in London central office has no justification for a company car.

GPU's have been used for bitcoin/altcoin mining and also folding@home for a long time now, the only thing to fail on cards that have not been run at reasonable temperatures (low/mid 70's) is the fans if they have been running at 80+% for extended periods of time.  I started a thread on this topic not too long ago and /u/DefiniteMethAddict gave an interesting reply [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HardwareSwapUK/comments/2xgew7/discussion_gpus_that_have_been_used_for_mining/cp0utyq) about differences between constant temperatures of mining and fluctuations of a gaming rig, fluctuations being bad.

I have run mining set ups myself, some 40+ gpu's and not had a problem benchmarking (3d mark, furmark) with any of the cards before selling them on and I have had only one card returned that the buyer says was not working in their machine.  I have since tested and sold the card on to a new buyer with no issues as it was working when I got it back, looks like the original buyer did not install windows in UEFI mode and didn't bother changing the switch on the card to see if that worked.

If the mining setup was done properly with sufficient cooling then it really is just a datacentre and these have been running under varying loads for quite a long time now.

People have pushed PCs/Servers pretty hard and far these days, if there was going to be an issue with GPUs that have been used for mining, I would have expected a thorough published write up on it by now to have surfaced.

It's pretty understandable really; he was the most experienced CB, playing in a team he's hardly played for, with a partner he's hardly played with, in a league he hasn't played in much at all. 

The fact of the matter is that he's much better than the average fourth choice CB for a club which probably won't even get sixth. I don't see what is hard to grasp about that. I think it's very unfair to judge him yet really, considering how much time we've given Soldado, Lamela etc to settle. Give the guy a break, we got a really experienced CB, who has been very successful in Europe, for a cheap sum of money, and he seems okay to not be first choice. That's above average for a squad player for a club of our stature.

 But even so the point isn't so much the make up of members, the point is that you can't make decisions that way ever. You need a party leadership coming up with a set of coordinated ideas that all make sense together and have had all the math and research done by people with the experience and knowledge to do that. Then you have X number of parties putting forward their set of ideas to run the country **that could work when the set is put together** and you vote for the one you want.

If you just say ""What shall our policies be everyone?"" Then you get a wishlist (or a set of future ambitions as they'd put it). It all sounds great because you're suddenly suggesting ideas that on their own would be awesome. A million new houses a year? Thats awesome, Vote Green! Ramp up the minimum wage? Awesome, Vote Green! Everyone gets free money? Awesome vote Green!

And those individual ideas aren't bad per se, but they cost, and they aren't independent of eachother or the rest of our services we like. Can we afford X number of houses a year? Where is that money coming from? Will the rate of building crash the housing market? Will we suddenly have to employ millions of builders who will all become unemployed at the same time in a few years? 

None of that is considered because the people suggesting and deciding the policies are just random members, and most people don't have the experience/knowledge to make an educated decision about it. All most people know is there aren't enough houses and we need more. If someone DID have the expertise and knowledge to make a workable way to build more houses then A) People would vote for the unreasonable one with more houses and no cuts, and B) That policy STILL wouldn't be coordinated with the rest of the policies. 

If building houses was part of a coordinated, costed and integrated plan that a real party made (which some real parties have) then you could vote for them because you want the country run that way. But if a party just says ""Oh these things are the things we think would be cool"" but hasn't figured out how they would all be implemented or how the hell a country could be run with their ideas, then they're not a real political party and voting for them is sort of a protest, but one that just says ""We like these things that other parties like but are trying to get to in a proper way that doesnt destroy the country""",null,0,null,1428836113,null,0,1428836329,0,cq9oqbq,null,t3_329xeq,null,t1_cq9oqbq,null,t1_cq9h44d,null,null,null,1432344650,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

This is why I said we shouldn't tax it directly. Wealth tax is a very bad idea for many reasons, but that doesn't mean wealth isn't a good *target* for tax. We should tax only monetary flows, but those rates of taxation should be based on the average wealth (after some statistical analysis).

For example, if a person earning £10k has £0 wealth, they should pay no tax. If a person earning £30k has average £250k wealth (pension + house + whatever), they should pay £5k tax.

Of course, since we have multiple rates of tax, we could use this to target specific 'wealth brackets' quite easily.

As a hypothetical to why targeting wealth is a good idea, suppose two people earn £100k per year. One person spends £20k and the other spends all £100k. I would argue the person spending more should pay less tax, since the economic advantage of wealth is passed on to others in the economy.

They're both rich now, but it's their upbringing that has determined their political beliefs.

More seriously though, what about being English necessitates being a unionist? There are plenty of pro-independence arguments, from the political right and left, Welsh and English.

Personally, I'm voting for Plaid because their politics are progressive. They have a similar stance to me in terms of austerity, human rights, public services, immigration, defence etc. Nationalism isn't a major issue for me, and even for Plaid independence is something they think is a long-term goal to work towards rather than something viable tomorrow. They have the potential to be a positive, leftward-pulling influence on the next government, and that's something I think is necessary. If it's eventually possible for Wales to stand on its own two feet, I think it's something people living in Wales should have the right to choose.

As an anarchist, I'm an anti-statist. In the more pragmatic, shorter term, I feel that smaller states are states that have less power to wage war and suppress their populaces, and allow individuals to speak with a proportionately louder voice.

Of the top ten countries on the Human Development Index, 9 have a lower population than the UK (only Germany is more populous, and 6 have a population under 10m.

On the Global Peace Index, of the top ten countries, again, 9 have a population lower than the UK and 8 have a population under 10m.

I'm not saying that less populous countries are categorically better to live in - that isn't necessarily a defensible claim. But it seems that statistically, the very populous ones are unlikely to be among the best places. In a manner of speaking, I'm a nationalist internationalist. Short of the end of coercive, political government worldwide, I think we'd be better off in a world committed to international co-operation and collaboration, made of a larger number of countries and city states, each with around a &lt;10m population.

OK, well you still haven't provided any real evidence of any ""diatribes of hate"", nor have you presented for me a video and/or transcript of a diatribe made by one Clare Balding. As far as I know you seem to take issue with Clare Balding being both openly gay and openly showing opposition to Russia's ""Anti homosexual propaganda"" bill. Well here's something you should know...

In the UK, we have this odd thing where you can express dissatisfaction and disagreement with something someone or something does or says and you can openly express this in any way you please. This is called ""Freedom of Speech"" and as long as you don't call for anyone to be killed or subjugated or indeed, carry out that threat, it's something everyone has the freedom to do. This means you, and others, can say things that others disagree with and you can do the same. If you disagree with them, you can present them with a counter argument or indeed, if their argument is beyond that, call them a wanker.

This is something not everyone, everywhere enjoys. Like Russia for example, where if you openly express support for LGBT rights or campaign for gay rights, you can be arrested and imprisoned for that under the Anti-gay propaganda law. The AGPL states that you are not allowed to say anything deemed ""pro homosexuality"" because somehow people's sexuality can be changed by saying nice things about a certain sexuality (something that is of course, bullshit). This has lead to people having their homes raided for saying something or performing acts of peaceful, non-violent protest.

Now I don't really care if you disagree with Mrs Balding, it is your right to no matter how stupid it may seem to me or factually wrong it may be, but the simple facts are that sport presenters have the right to not only be open about their sexuality, but also express dissatisfaction at the actions of a state that are holding an international sporting event and your opinion, no matter how factually wrong it is or stupid it may seem to me, has the right to exist and I have the right only to refute this (and whether or not you will listen is up to you) or simply tell you this:

You are an idiot.

Regarding the Laffer curve I'm certainly no expert but most people would put 60% below or around the mid-point but yeah it's not a factual thing, I just find it strange that it's only 15% more than the Tories and 10% more than Labour's prospective one but is treated as if it's in absolute cloud cuckoo land.

How about something more high-tech, like aerospace? Nope, 90% of those [earn about 50k](http://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Aerospace_Engineer/Salary).

Lawyers and corporate lawyers both do fairly better - 90 percentile is at 90k salary. Still well short of 150k. 

Headmasters do even better: [median salary at 55k and 90 percentile at 120k](http://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Principal_%2f_Headmaster/Salary). I figure this is because there are fewer headmasters than lawyers.

Now Neurosurgeons, on the other hand.... [Median at 100k, 90 percentile at... 300k](http://www.payscale.com/research/UK/Job=Neurosurgeon/Salary). Or Hedge fund managers, with 170k median. But considering that not even one percent of one percent of the population are neurosurgeons... And I'm not losing sleep over taxing hedge fund managers.

&gt; The victims in road accidents are not seen as unworthy of justice, it's more the case that simply assigning blame based solely on who has the larger vehicle would not be justice.

Who said it was?

&gt; We have a fair legal framework for assigning fault and blame, it is a fair assumption that in the vast majority of cases such a legal framework provides the correct verdict of exactly who is culpable and exactly how far their culpability extends.

This is where we disagree.

I was thinking about this sort of thing myself. I was lucky enough to go to a private school, and there was a huge mix of people there:

 - Statemented (which means their council paid the fees).
 - Mum and dad earned good, but not stupendous money - they'd be in the equivalent of your ""£100k/year"" bracket (probably rather less than that because it was nineteen years ago now, but you get the idea). They'd doubtless had to make substantial sacrifices to pay the fees, particularly if they had two or more kids in the school. Bursaries (basically a discount on the fees) were available which made it a bit easier, but with a 25% discount it'd still be £9.75k/year.
 - Very wealthy parents - usually company directors or people in the media.

null,false,kittysaysmeownow,null,null,null,"I'm a US expat. You guys do NOT want your market flooded - American style. It's brutal. America runs on completely pure, unbridled capitalism. Money is the only thing that makes the rules there. If it's profitable, it's acceptable, end of.  There are no standards in any industry that can't be lobbied away. 

I thought I'd note some things that maybe y'all have never experienced in day-to-day life, that are completely standard over there:

- You use the cash machine to withdraw a small amount of cash from your current account. You are charged £2 by the bank and another £2 from the machine provider for this service. There are no free machines, but you can save half of it by only using your bank's machines.

- A synthesized food substitution has been proven beyond doubt to cause cancer. But it is substantially cheaper than the ingredient it substitutes, and so it suddenly appears in every ready meal on the market. 

- You need medication for an illness. Without it your health is at extreme risk. The name brand medication costs £200 a month, the generic only £50, but your GP won't prescribe a generic version because he has an agreement with the name brand supplier. 

There are quite a few cultural differences that make the UK an amazing place to me. Most of that has to do with quality control, consumer and employee rights, the safety net for those who fall financially, and health care.

While there are a few things America does better, like technology and infrastructure, the implications and cost to the European consumer would be tragic. It's just another way to fleece the masses, except this time the fruits are handed straight over to the Americans.

Maybe I'm over-simplifying, but this kind of sounds like the EU is just handing over it's economy for American pillage. And I can't wait for Chinese imports to start flooding the market via the US, seeing as how UK importers still have to pay Chinese import duty and they don't.

 [**Tax rates of Europe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax%20rates%20of%20Europe): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;This is a list of the maximum potential [tax rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate) around Europe for certain income brackets. It is focused on three types of taxes: corporate and individual taxes and value added taxes (VAT). It is not intended to represent the true tax burden to either the corporation or the individual in the listed country.

&gt;The quoted income tax rate is, except where noted, the top rate of tax: most jurisdictions have lower rate of taxes for low levels of income. Some countries also have lower rates of corporation tax for smaller companies. In 1980, the top rates of most European countries were above 60 percent. Today most European countries have rates below 50%.

Breakdown, paragraph by paragraph. 
I want a HOME not money, why would I want my company paying me more just to cover the cost of rent, so they would effectively be putting money again straight back into the pockets of the banks and those with 2 homes. You want someone on a low wage to be paid more purely to make the rich richer. Excuse me whilst I take a moment to call you a cunt, you cunt.

The population increase isn't a factor, it's the refusal to allocate unused land by the government for new homes. Farmers are paid money to leave their fields fallow whilst thousands of people desperately search for space to build an affordable property. This won't happen, due to the property bubble and lack of space the cost of building a new home is completely irrelevant compared to its land price. Open up the land and you pop the bubble, the rich have to sell their second/third homes as rental properties have a shift in supply and demand and we end the housing crisis. But, the rich won't be happy. Theres so, so much unused land where nimbyism isn't an issue. (look at the Olympic village) 

Nice false dichotomy, just because I want to see an end to the marginalisation of the poor or disabled doesn't mean we have to turn to an even worse system. You also fail at reading comprehension - I don't want to live in Dalston/Camden/kings cross, but on benefits it's my only option. I would rather live in the countryside in a property that cost half as much as a London bachelor pad, but the London pad is free whereas the country cottage would cost me a lot. I'm costing the tax payer more (MUCH more) for no good reason.

You say I have no basis, my old man's a landlord for a string of student properties in bath, I know exactly how they work. The rental market is a sellers market at the moment, a property will be let within 24 hours, 95% of the time, prices are literally being pushed up on a monthly basis and this has been going on for at least the last 4 years. A friend was renting a 3 bed for £900 up until the rent was increased to £1600, the property was re-let the next day. And again, who is benefitting here? Billy 2 homes. Why would a government prioritise the man with 2 homes over the man with nothing.

To give you an idea of how the government treats and marginalises the disabled, if you were to become disabled tomorrow and wished to claim benefits, you would have to prove you don't have assets worth over £15k, you have to sell your home, your cars, your jewellery, antiques, heir looms, empty the bank accounts. What do you get in return? Having to move house every 2 years as the market shifts, saying good bye to all your local friends and family. Oh and good luck going out and making new friends, in your new area when you're in a chair plugged into a catheter.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"&gt; As far as I can see, median salaries for [assorted professionals] are well below

No, I am actually right... and it links back to what I said... You are looking at median salary - the people who earn those salaries aren't the median... they are the **career peak**. These are the guys who have been working for 30+ years. So for example to use your first example of doctors, your average starting salary for a a newly qualified doctor is about £22K basic (worked out on a 40 hour week), but they actually take home closer to £35k (because of the extra and anti-social hours). A more senior doctor like a newly qualified consultant, aged probably between 35 and 40, **[earns £75K](http://bma.org.uk/practical-support-at-work/pay-fees-allowances/pay-scales)**... so, exactly like you said **median** pay is nowhere near £150K. **HOWEVER**, the more senior consultant aged about 60, in his or her last 5 years of work would **[earn a basic of £101K](http://bma.org.uk/practical-support-at-work/pay-fees-allowances/pay-scales)**, with a level 5 clinical excellence award giving them a further £14K. Their private practice could then earn them £40K+.

&gt; Now Neurosurgeons, on the other hand.... Median at 100k, 90 percentile at... 300k.

Payscales isn't very accurate, I would avoid it. For example neurosurgeons are doctors like any other type. Doctors are not paid by specialty but rather by grade. A consultant psychiatrist earns just as much from the NHS as a consultant plastic surgeon. The only difference is certain specialties lend themselves more to private work where pay is dictated by demand, and significantly larger incomes can be gained... and probably the most lucrative are plastics, orthopaedics and dermatology. 

&gt; Headmasters do even better... 

This again is a deceptive error of the way payscales is calculating the figures on a median. You don't walk into work on day 1 of being a teacher and be made the head teacher... for most it's a **career peak** position that they only occupy in their last 10 years of the job. That's why headteachers are 55-60 and not 30. 

Which all ties back into my original point.. taxing these people heavily is a bad idea. These aren't the sort of people society is out to rinse dry... these are lifetime do-gooders who have worked hard usually largely in the public sector. The rest of the *""boo hiss 1%""* that everyone seems to love to hate get their incomes in more convoluted ways. They don't just get £200K of PAYE into their account each year... that sort of earning is very unusual. Few people earning those sorts of take homes are receiving it as a simple monthly income.

Nonetheless, GDP describes the amount of money in the economy. Money is conjured out of the air and given to a class of people comprising a tiny minority of our society. GDP is a mathematical figure given to present a view of the health of our economy as a simple shorthand to help you to believe that there is growth and that the society you live in is ""successful"" (which is why your fragile ego is so attached to the bullshit that comes with the discussion of GDP) but GDP doesn't represent anything about the health of society and it incorporates the results of the financial sector's fraudulent gambling casino world which is generally harmful to those of us not involved, it represents things like arms sales and the profits of companies paying their staff inadequate wages. The uptick in GDP reported is happening even though millions of people are being attacked via the medium of money. It completely ignores the ""externalities"" of economic activity and to who the benefits go. Therefore, it is a lie that is there to convince you to believe a story that is harming you. It doesn't measure anything. It is propaganda tool.

They are the people who have, through a career of dedication, simply become so valuable to public services that they are **worth** those sorts of salaries. I wouldn't want to run an entire hospital or all the secondary schools in the south east... and if someone does, and they want to take home £160K for the pleasure of doing it then fucking good on them!

&gt; If you can't counter the 90-percentile figures then you don't have much of an argument.

As I pointed out, this 1% concept has become a simplistic bogeyman. I don't disagree with the underlying sentiment that there exists a group of people who are absurdly wealthy whose extravagances only make the fact the rest of us don't have much even harder to swallow. I don't think the people this tax measure will target are those people though. 

The people you are thinking of tend to be extremely wealthy in assets, and it is from those assets that they derive much of their actual income. For example the property tycoon with swathes of valuable north London properties, or the oil baron living a jet set life of luxury on the benefit of millions of pounds of black gold in Russia.

Yes.

&gt;even though only a small minority of them have HIV?

Are you in capable of reading any statistics on the matter. The majority of them have HIV.

Edit: I believe all populations with significant risk factors should be excluded from giving blood. Including, but not limited to, intravenous drug users, people who have sex in exchange for drugs/money, and MSM (men who have sex with men). All these populations have significant risk factors for contracting and possessing diseases. Someone please tell me, where is the logic in allowing those populations to give blood? Why risk the exposure to the rest if society?

Its a simple numbers game and the health of the general population cannot, and should not, be compromised simply because the current narrative is that we must make concessions to homosexuals because otherwise it *might* disparage them.

When they stop spreading AIDS so much, then I'll consider supporting their bid to donate their blood.

Then from Enniskillen you'll need to get the 94, it'll say Omagh on the front of it and usually say via Ballinamallard. They have shite times at the weekends though and don't run after 6:30pm on week days. So when you get on that one, get a ticket for Trillick and sit back. Watch the world go by but make sure to keep a watch on things.

After you leave Enniskillen the first town will say Ballinamallard so don't get off. The next wee place you'll go through will be Kilskeery it'll have a big hall on the right hand side. Don't get off there either. The next notable place is another village but it's signed as Trillick as you go past a big black chapel. It's actually huge. So press the bell and get up and the bus driver will stop in the middle and you'll be outside Costcutter/Nisa in Trillick before you know it.

Has anyone here ever had an issue where religion was a factor in any way? I struggle to think that anyone in the U.K. cares what other people believe in real life, beyond jockeying for votes or proving a preconceived opinion.

On the frontpage of Secularism they talk about ending 'enforced worship' in schools. I went to a Church of England school and we were never forced to do anything. Even R.E. was well balanced and they never preached the entire time. If you didn't want to recite the prayer in assembly, you didn't have to.

null,false,Sky-Sky,null,null,null,"&gt;When we talk about a fair society, it seems fair that people that earn more pay more tax. But where does it stop? 60% of all your earnings over a certain amount, in my mind, seems unfair to people who already contribute far more than I do. Yes some of them are just there because of luck. But most are there because they worked harder, or made smarter decisions, or invested more in their education.

I am not sure this is true. The mega rich are not there because they worked 100000 times harder than the barrista in my local coffee shop. Wealth is clearly not a meritocracy where how much money you earn is directly proportional to how hard you work.

Traits like selfishness, lack of empathy, meanness, intelligence are the sorts of things that get you a lot of money - look at the banking sector. Those are psychopathic traits too.

Not all rich people are like this, of course, and the definition of rich will vary from person to person - but the idea of wealth being proportional to your hard work just clearly isn't true.

I imagine someone who is intelligent and hard working but also kind, caring, empathetic might not be motivated as much by accruing money and instead set other goals for themselves in life - goals that might well have more social value anyway than the rich CEO, such as healthcare, public service.",null,1,null,1428844184,null,0,1428844427,0,cq9qns7,null,t3_32bceo,null,t1_cq9qns7,null,t1_cq9pnxd,null,null,null,1432345559,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I've always found in the UK that the people around me are more offended by racism than I am. Here's a few of my life experiences as a half 'black' individual:

- I only have contact with my mother's side of the family (all white) and I have always lived in a very rural, suburban area, so I think the first non-white person I remember in life was Patrick from Eastenders.

- In primary school a boy used to call me 'chocolate girl' and 'Scary Spice' all the time, as a small child I was only offended because Baby Spice was my favourite. I was once off sick with the flu for a few days, when I came back I heard that this boy had been seriously disciplined and the teachers had spoken to his parents because they thought I was skipping school because I was upset by the names he was calling me.

- Another time in primary school, I got out of class because I said I was sad that the only other brown person (they were Indian so no relation at all, just not white) was leaving so I had to go and say goodbye. I was fine to go, no questions asked.

- Another boy in secondary school used to refer to me by the N word, I wasn't too bothered but warned him to stop because he might eventually come across someone who did care and might hurt him. Word spread and I had offers from the 'hard kids' to beat him up for me.

- On a bus once my friend, who is Chinese, and I were shouted at by a drunken man who told us we weren't British. Everyone else's response was disgust. Me and my friend just found it ridiculous.


The weirdest thing is that my (white) mother and I once had an argument because she told me how disadvantaged I was probably going to be in life being a mixed race daughter of a single mother. I've (luckily) never had any problems due to either of these issues, to be honest, if anything I swear it's given me an advantage?

http://ukscblog.com/case-comment-durkin-v-dsg-retail-limited-anor-2014-uksc-21/

&gt;The court addressed the reality of such arrangements by suggesting that the law implies a term whereby the survival of a credit agreement is conditional upon the survival of the supply agreement. By rejecting the goods and thereby rescinding the supply agreement Mr Durkin could also rescind the credit agreement by invoking the implied condition.

&gt;Furthermore the court found that HFC were under a delictual duty to investigate whether a supply agreement had been rescinded and they should not have intimated a default to the various credit agencies without having investigated the matter first.

They arrived at this figure [by extrapolating data on the total death rate of all migrants in the country](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/26/qatar-world-cup-migrant-workers-dead). 

What they didn't highlight is that the rates include all deaths, including those from natural causes. Taking that into consideration, 4,000 deaths from 1.4 million working age males is actually a low rate and suggests that they are safer working in Qatar than if they had remained in their home countries. You could therefore argue that Qatar hosting the world cup is actually *saving* lives.

However, they chose to gloss over this and go with the headline implying that these workers are dying off in droves because of poor health and safety on site, which is of course more dramatic.",null,0,null,1428845566,null,0,1428846458,0,cq9r3gc,null,t3_31zjgd,null,t1_cq9r3gc,null,t3_31zjgd,null,null,null,1432345764,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

How is driving your vehicle at speed into a space you can't see not negligent?

By 'a sectarian state', I'm assuming you mean the Unionist-controlled Stormont government. Which was abolished. In 1972. By Edward Heath's Tory government. The UK governments - both Labour and Tory - then tried and failed to put in a power-sharing government, and dismantled some of the worst parts of the sectarian discrimination that had been instituted in the province over the previous 50-60 years. Clearly the Tories are unionist (the clue is in the name, after all), and they're generally horrible shitbags, but mainland tories couldn't give a rat's fuck whether the serfs they rule over happen to be Roman Catholic, Church of England, Judean Presbyterian Church, or free love Zen Rastafarian, just so long as they're a useful source of cheap labour. And when sectarianism turns out to be bad for business, they're only too happy to get rid of it. Nonsectarian, but unionist, see?

(And of course, any government in the circumstances would be limited as to what it could do. For instance, making material reforms to the RUC, while you still depended on them for police work AND helping fight against the paramilitaries would be a tricky thing for ANY government to pull off.)

For example, allowing me to retire early.  Or if I need that money, I close the company and issue dividends to myself and my wife, which is taxed at only 25%.

One place I worked a few years ago had core hours of 9-6 but you were regarded as a clock-watcher if you actually left on time, or arrived even a few minutes late, and you had to book a half-day off if you had a doctor's appointment, and that had to be booked a few weeks in advance. That was a shitty place to work in general though, and the company directors/owners were utter wankers. 

Another place I worked, the director had a thing about 'presentee-ism' where he didn't want anyone with a cold coming into the office to infect other people, and was fine about working from home as and when, so long as the work got done. He also sometimes declared 'fuck-it-friday' at about three o'clock and called a team-building exercise in the local pub. The problem with this was that you were expected to do whatever it took to get things done and available on the phone or email to sort things out for clients as soon as they wanted it, so it was flexible and not structured, but you could get a call on a weekend and you'd have to sort something out.

I'm worried about us being static in the final third and not doing enough with possession and being killed on the counter. 

We've all had the love hate relationship with 4-4-2, but I'm hoping Pellers will opt for the 4-2-3-1 instead. Dzeko, Nasri and Aguero together don't do enough on the defensive phase. Ideally I'd like Kolarov and Zabaleta to play for width and their overlapping runs. I want Milner to start with Navas and Silva in the centre feeding Aguero as the sole striker. 

I know Navas has been receiving flak but I'd use him over Nasri, because he's excellent in the transition phases. He doesn't hold up the ball and his pace is excellent. He tracks back as well. Milner to give support for the left back given United's pace on the wings.

totally irrelevant emotionally driven nonsense, just like this policy suggestion

It's not about being comfortable, it's about keeping what you earn. If you earn £10m, and the government of the place you're living tells you that you need to shell out £6m for staying there, compared to Switzerland who'll charge you £3m, you'd get up and go.

If we're talking about comfort being the issue then just tax everyone over the living-wage 100% and then it's truly fair.

We can all sit here and rabbit on about how we'll ""help them pack"", but what the fuck is the point in that?

null,false,wherearemyfeet,null,null,null,"&gt; Many argue Organic is better for the environment than conventional food production, if he believes that then maybe he is doing it because he wants to protect the environment.

Indeed they do. They'd be dead wrong though, and I doubt someone as involved in the agricultural industry is sold so easily by the marketing fluff.

&gt;Protecting the environment is obviously an important thing to do and ""the right thing to do"".

Using organic pesticides that have legal usage limits because they leave permanent heavy metal deposits in the soil (copper sulphate) isn't protecting the environment. He's not an idiot or someone who only hears the PR fluff, he knows this.

&gt;I still have not seen what personal benefit he gets from supporting the organic industry

As I said before, I'm just speculating. However the most likely answer will be the same as any other wealthy individual who directly funds a for-profit industry lobby group: It promotes and benefits their business interests. Again, I don't have access to his personal financial information so I don't know where his assets are held, but there is literally no reason why he would fund a lobby group other than it the fact that this lobby group benefit his business interests. If I were a wealthy individual, why would I fund a lobby group for, say, the road-laying industry for any other reason than their lobbying efforts benefitted me?

&gt;his support of organic is actually bad for his political career in the Tory party and the possibility of any donations from agrobusiness. 

Hardly. Organic food isn't a hot political button (it's supported by both the ""hippy"" element of the left and the ""it's all *natural* element of the upper-middle classes), and receiving funding from the agricultural industry (not that I've seen any evidence to suggest this is the case) isn't exactly going to be a career-killer.",null,0,null,1428847311,null,0,false,0,cq9rpj3,null,t3_31w94l,null,t1_cq9rpj3,null,t1_cq9pua6,null,null,null,1432346053,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

And besides your admitted personal bias, what makes you think this is actually what happened? Dude, they're a bunch of politicians! They will happily pander to the emotional bias of their demographic for votes despite their position flying in the face of the evidence. Look at their policy on GM foods: Literally all the evidence suggests GM food poses zero harm to humans, and the global scientific consensus echoes this point. This clearly hasn't stopped them from banging the ""GM foods are something to be *scared of*"" drum to pander to their demographic, just like the Tories/Labour do with drugs and UKIP do with climate change.

&gt;Regarding the Laffer curve I'm certainly no expert but most people would put 60% below or around the mid-point but yeah it's not a factual thing, I just find it strange that it's only 15% more than the Tories and 10% more than Labour's prospective one but is treated as if it's in absolute cloud cuckoo land.

The laffer curve isn't a fixed amount. It varies depending on a load of variables. In one scenario, it could be 70%, in another, it could be 35%. Even then, it's still not an exact science. So the Greens stating they'll increase it to 60% while showing they've done nothing whatsoever to ensure that this is viable shows that it is nothing more than pandering to the emotions of their demographic.",null,0,null,1428847632,null,0,false,0,cq9rtv7,null,t3_32bceo,null,t1_cq9rtv7,null,t1_cq9pdap,null,null,null,1432346110,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It's only very recently that secularism has become the norm, a few generations of unbelievers does not undo the influence of Christianity over hundreds of years. 

I think most people who are avowed atheists drastically downplay the extent to which they are influenced by the Christian ethos of their parents' or grandparents' generation.  Even when you offload the theology you're still seeing the world through that prism. It's not something you can opt-out of. It's so embedded in our culture that we can't really shake it off. Not when it informs concepts as basic as property rights, sanctity of human life, or the distinction between public and private spheres. 

The idea that people invent their own holistic moral outlook and culture from scratch the moment they stop going to church is just absurd. Our secular political philosophies, from conservatism to socialism, have their roots in Biblical exegesis and the legacy of the generations who went before who did believe.

Put it this way? Your GPs earn £150,000. Suddenly they are being hit with a 60% tax. Everyone goes ""well? You are rich! You can afford it!"". The problem is? The people who tend to be in this bracket aren't footballers who are ALWAYS the example brought up. They are people who work more than 50 to 60 hours a week doing a job that's desperately wanted and often thankless. 

Now they earn less. Begging the question? 

Why did they spend so many years wasting their lives, stressing out, working at such excellence and meeting often insane targets when the idiots are now just going to take more than 50% of their income as taxes THEN demand they keep dancing through hoops. 

If doctors salaries take home pay goes down, do you think people would become doctors in fields like A&amp;E and Obs and Gynae (Fields with high scrutiny and high rates of litigation.). 

The NHS would have to increase doctor's pay across the board and that's not really happened in years. Even with increases in NHS funding, very little has reached the lowest rungs of doctors. Unless the NHS is going to maintain the same standard of living for its doctors who are already clamouring for pay rises, I am afraid they are just going to vote with their feet. Australia pays more and offers enough incentives to poach a fair few of our doctors.

Drogba is depressingly short of spark. After coming out the gate and making a few runs in the opening quarter hour he barely fucking moved the rest of the match. Without a doubt one of my favorite players ever but God damn he was worthless today.


Sandro did quite a good job handling Hazard today. Probably one of the best performances we've seen against our no. 10 this season. He played aggressively sure and there were some tough tackles but nothing Hazards not expecting at this point. That in mind, I think an earlier switch to the 3 behind the striker could have allowed us to grab hold of this game a bit earlier.


I've said it once, I'll say it a thousand times, our corners are just pitiful. Seriously we need to go back to the drawing board on those things (and set pieces in general). We could have changed a lot of games by getting even just a few attempts on frame from them, especially today but noooo, Cesc and Willian and Oscar keep hitting these bullshit inswingers 5 feet off the ground into the near post where they are cleared by the first man, so frustrating.


Courtois is just unbelievable. This is the kind of slow dragging game where one wouldn't be surprised to see a goalkeeper concede a somewhat soft goal because he has rarely had anything to do. But not with fucking Thibaut. His concentration is always 100% and that save on the inform Matty Phillips was glorious.


Good to see Cesc and Matic not getting booked despite that prick Barton targeting Matic all game long.

Maybe this is the problem. Have you met any of them? Do you personally have any justifiable account of pathologically negative behaviour on their part?

If you're bothered personally about making loads of money, or don't think it desirable yourself etc., what business is it of yours to dictate what others do with what might be the fruits of their own labour and desire to pursue financial wealth? (Remember: not everyone who seeks wealth is inherently psychopathic, or would need to do so by psychopathic means.)

I don't think anyone would disagree when asked whether all those negative traits were good. It's like taking the 7 deadly sins and just saying they're not healthy. Of course they aren't!

null,false,AimHere,null,null,null,"&gt;If you think the Stormont government was the only thing sectarian about Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s 

I didn't. You mentioned a 'sectarian state', and that was the only sectarian state around at the time. I did also say that the government was limited in it's ability to act. Nobody could have eliminated sectarianism in Northern Ireland, but the UK governments did curb some of the worst parts by outlawing discrimination and abolishing the government.

&gt;Collusion between the British army and loyalist paramilitaries? The RUC? 

I did already note that taking something like the RUC to bits in the middle of the war would have been very difficult (you'd be talking about increasing the likelihood a loyalist revolt, and a loyalist revolt inside the security forces no less). The UDR would be something similar, and of course, the UDR was the *result* of already taking the B specials to bits because of it's notorious history of abuse. It was an attempt at reforming a sectarian institution, though clearly not a successful attempt.

Now the collusion certainly did exist, but the bulk of the collusion allegations relating to specifically sectarian murders happened in the mid 1970s, with the retroactively named Glenanne Gang, and it's alleged relationship with the undercover military units led by Robert Nairac and Julian Ball. Now this would be far below the level that a Tory or Labour party politician would generally have oversight (it mostly took place under Labour's watch, and if you saw that [After Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caUG4L-3S30) programme with Merlyn Rees, it was clearly obvious that he knew *fuck all* about what was happening in the departments on his watch. I don't expect other Northern Ireland secretaries were any better informed). 

The other thing was that many the sectarian murders of the Glenanne Gang were aimed at thwarting UK government policy. Remember, this was the runup to the Kingsmills massacre; the Provisional IRA had a ceasefire and was talking to the British government, so the UVF, and sympathetic British Army officers, had a strategy of drawing the IRA into a squalid tit-for-tat sectarian murder campaign to blow the ceasefire. The collusion here was actually acting *against* the elected government; remember at the same time 'Clockwork Orange' was happening, where the British Army press office was deliberately smearing Wilson, Heath, and other politicians. Add to this the MI5/MI6 turf wars, and the battle between the Stalker Inquiry and the RUC, and it turns out bits of the British government aren't always all on the same side, you know...

The other big swathe of collusion allegations relate to the FRU and Brian Nelson in the late 1980s. This time round, they weren't acting against the government, though, again, ministers likely didn't know about it - preferring a 'don't ask, don't tell' situation, I'd guess. Instead this was a terror campaign aimed at Republican activists and relatives of paramilitaries (the statistics show that loyalists around this time were actually a bit more discriminating in their targets, and only about half of their victims were civilians - and even some of those, such as Pat Finucane, would have been a targeted assassination, rather than a purely sectarian murder). 

I'm not saying that what the British government did was good, or anything, but it wasn't generally motivated by religious sectarianism, the way that local Northern Irish institutions were. 

&gt;The Military Reaction Force? Can you please explain to me what part British army personnel murdering civilians in drive-by shooting played in ""[dismantling] much of the sectarian discrimination""?

It had nothing to do with sectarian discrimination one way or another - in fact, at the time, people thought the war was mainly between the IRA and the British army, and they thought IRA was just shooting civilians, left, right and centre. Loyalists only started murdering people in earnest around the middle of 1972 (there was a long lull from 1970 and some shootings in late 1971, but it wasn't until Bloody Friday that the shit hit the fan). Even then, they didn't claim the killings, so most people (and certainly most people from outside Northern Ireland) assumed the IRA was behind the bulk of the shootings, until mid 1973 - after the MRF was disbanded - when two Belfast journalists, Martin Dillon and Dennis Lehane, pored over the stats and realised that it was Loyalists who were doing the bulk of the killings at the time.

Essentially, the MRF were doing their thing before the British realised they were dealing with a proper sectarian war, and were disbanded before they realised otherwise. It doesn't relate to sectarianism much at all, other than their intended targets happened to be drawn from one side of the community, because that's who they honestly thought were committing all of the murders.",null,0,null,1428849713,null,0,1428851607,0,cq9so58,null,t3_32b92b,null,t1_cq9so58,null,t1_cq9rr16,null,null,null,1432346506,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Sorry but this really isn't true. UK government officials and MEPs current do not have a comprehensive list of terms already negotiated and are unable to scrutinise. Once the agreement has been made the government will have a short scrutiny period but ALL documents are then locked away for 30 years to prevent the public from reading it. Can you think of a single justification for locking the documents away for 30 years? 

&gt;But TTIP has wide support from governments, and national parliaments will only get a brief period to scrutinise the deal before being asked to ratify it.

&gt;And if they do, it'll be hard to call anyone to account. All the documentation will be locked away for 30 years.

People are blowing this proposal way out of proportion, it's not going to hit ordinary working people hard.

Also: interesting to note that there's relatively little difference according to political voting intentions:

- Tory voters are the most likely to believe in God (40%), UKIP voters are the least likely (34%).

- UKIP voters are the most likely to be practicing Christians (37%), Labour voters are the least likely (31%). (By the way: that means that 3% of UKIP voters are practising Christians who *don't* believe in God...)

- Lib Dem voters are almost as likely to be practising Christians as UKIP voters (36% vs 37%), but with a very different breakdown by 'flavour' of Christian (26% of UKIP voters are CofE/CofW, compared to only 16% of Lib Dem voters).",null,0,null,1428850614,null,0,false,0,cq9t239,null,t3_32bpjv,null,t1_cq9t239,null,t3_32bpjv,null,null,null,1432346688,null,151,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,151,null

ahahahaha

http://www.avert.org/hiv-aids-uk.htm -- ""An estimated 98,400 people in the UK... are currently living with HIV"" of which ""an estimated 40,900 MSM were living with HIV in the UK"". So that's less than half of HIV+ people are MSM straight off the bat.

So how many LGBT people are there in the UK, anyway? http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/oct/03/gay-britain-what-do-statistics-say ""Altogether, amounts to about 545,000 homosexual and 220,000 bisexual adults in the UK.""  Okay, around 800,000.

The paragraph ""Gay men outnumber gay women?"" suggests there's a 2:1 ratio of gay/bi men to gay/bi women. This means there's around 500,000 gay/bi men in the UK. Now, if we assume that 50% of gay/bi men are MSM (it's probably more than that in reality), that's 250,000 MSMs. If you consider 41,000 MSMs with HIV to be a majority of 250,000 MSMs in total then I suggest you stop commenting on Reddit and pick up a year 1 maths textbook.

Hard as it may be to imagine, some people don't actually work solely for money. I would imagine that if your job was running a hospital you might find yourself working 70 hour weeks for reasons other than money. For example, because the job is challenging and requires a big time commitment. Those are the sorts of jobs people spend an entire career building towards - and you're not just in it for the money. It's probably because they've been in those companies/institutions for the better part of 2 or 3 decades all the time thinking *""Christ, I could do this better if I was in charge""* - and are finally given that opportunity.

When you work at Sainsbury's etc. you **work** for them. You turn up at 8, you go home at 6 and you stick your food in the oven and get on with **your** life. When you run 12 schools you probably find it extends a little bit beyond working for them... in a sense, you **are** the job you provide. That's probably why these sorts of people - senior doctors, headteachers, regional managers etc. tend to come across as a bit monolithic, because their job is pretty monolithic. If it boils down to *""put the hours in, or get my face in the newspapers come Monday morning""* I'm pretty sure they'd be ploughing the hours in. 

Anyway, I don't think it's necessarily fair to tax these people heavily simply on the basis they are well paid... their pay is **FAIR** remuneration for hard work. And that is what this boils down to, whether or not it is fair for someone to earn that much money. I would argue that *a)* it is fair and *b)* it is also part of the incentive that pushes people to strive in their work.

EDIT: I thought I'd explain this a bit better.  Both Attlee and Blair, in their very different ways, changed the UK significantly in ways that outlasted their premierships.  Whatever you think of the impact these Prime Ministers had on the country, you can't deny that it was lasting and significant.

* Attlee founded the modern welfare state and moved vast parts of industry into the public sector.  His administration also presided over the independence of British India (now India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, comprising almost a quarter of the world's population).
* Blair presided over some of the most significant constitutional reforms in recent UK history:  devolution to Scotland and Wales, reform of the House of Lords, reform of the judiciary and the introduction of the Supreme Court, and the Human Rights Act.  Two other changes: independence of the Bank of England  and the Freedom of Information Act, also proved to be lasting shifts in the structure of power in the UK.
* By contrast, I think of Wilson as *managing* a series of problems rather than making permanent changes to the political landscape.  He made many significant decisions: such as devaluation, sending troops to Northern Ireland, the referendum on the EEC, and keeping the UK out of the Vietnam war (thanks /u/alexgmcm), but few seem to have had a lasting impact on the UK today (although I guess there are still troops in Northern Ireland).

I like how you try and counter his fallacious argument with an equally absolute and fallacious one. The *only* people that would leave are the super wealthy? Take a look at France, made a shift from a right-wing Government to a left-wing government with a top-rate tax shift to about 70%. The result was that London is now France's sixth biggest city and they're now less economically stable and the average poor person is slightly worse off than they were under Sarcozy.  

The reasons you list grow less and less important year on year:


* visas - Not so much of a problem within the EU.  

* friends, family - Not so much of the problem seeing as it takes me longer and is more expensive to get from my house to my parents house (both in England) than it does for my co-worker to get to Poland.  

 
* language - Again, for many jobs this is not a problem especially if you're English.  


* uncertainty - Risk vs reward argument. A shift from 40 to 60% top rate tax might be deemed sufficiently high to try working in Germany for a bit.  

* culture - Relatively irrelevant.  ",null,0,null,1428852309,null,0,1428852672,0,cq9ttu7,null,t3_32bceo,null,t1_cq9ttu7,null,t1_cq9q1rt,null,null,null,1432347052,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

If you are owed 30,000 pounds and someone wants to give you only 20,000 you would be mad. If you were getting 150,000 quid when your salary hasn't risen and your work load has gone up you too would want a raise. 

That's nice that you have taken the moral high ground but here is the thing? It's easy to take the moral high ground when you don't have our hours, our work load and our stresses. We aren't in it for the money, no doctor is mate. It's  easier to become a lawyer and cheaper too. My lawyer cousin has a porsche. I cannot even afford to buy a car. My lawyer cousin has a nice flat in London. I live in a bed sit. 

High ideals don't put food on my plate. 

Also? Replace doctor with any other job and you will realise how unrealistic your demands on us are. Not only are we supposed to treat you but we cannot earn a profit and you are dictating to us that the 15 odd years of minor salary increases not keeping up with inflation and increased cost of living should also be more taxed so we take home less salary and we are supposed to be grateful?

Cesc pulled a Lampard at the end, but most of the game he looked really bad.

Cahill was amazing today. He saved our ass a few times, especially in the first half when we were really under threat.

Oscar made an immediate impact. As soon as he came on we looked like a different team

Courtois is just incredible. I don't understand how anyone can do the things he does.

Hazard looked invisible for most of the game, but had a moment of magic to set up Cesc for the winner. Even in a poor performance he can change the game. This man deserves player of the year.

They want to 'standardize' banking regulation between both sides of the pond as part of this. American banking regulation is one of the most lobbied and politically protected practices over there. Those banks won't be rising up to the European standard - I can promise you that. So the only option would be for the EU to lower it's bar, making things like this quite commonplace, as it is over there.

In terms of this particular point, you would indeed expect increased competition to minimize this. But America is as free market as it gets, and what's happened there is all the banks collectively do the same thing and collectively profit. I had a small bank that didn't do this once, and they were promptly bought out by a larger, richer bank, who took up my account, and added their fees to it.

All of my points have to do with regulation. America will NOT be raising it's standards on carcinogens in food, banking regulations, or pharmaceutical costs. In order to 'standardize' these things with across the pond, the EU will need to lower it's bar substantially, on all these fronts, and many others. 

Also, FYI, I do ecommerce for a living and I could actually save a lot of money with this, I do pay loads in customs duties on US imports currently, and it would surely boost my business. I'm still against it because I've been there. I know whatever I save is not worth what the sacrifices will be. I'll take the consumer protections instead, thanks.

No you didn't, you said ""The only people who may leave would be the super-wealthy who are truly global."" That's not saying ""it would be more likely"" it's an absolute statement implying only the super wealthy would leave.

&gt; and their absurd labour laws which are: biased towards seniority instead of merit; make it hard to fire unproductive workers and force companies to give ridiculous paid vacation (the state radio must give those employees who have worked there for more than 8 years 14 weeks paid vacation a year.)

This has been the case in France for years, not just one year. The top rate tax might have only been in place since November in 2013 but the Labour laws and excessive Government interference have existed for ages. Also this is exactly the sort of business interference planned by the Green party.

&gt;You forgot (or maybe just ignored) that Hollande came to power during the euro crisis of 2012, external circumstances may have something to do with France's poor performance

And Cameron came to power in 2010 and we're doing relatively well compared to France. The external circumstances applied to the whole of Europe and to date we've recovered better from it than anyone.

null,false,spiz,null,null,null,"&gt; Once the agreement has been made the government will have a short scrutiny period but ALL documents are then locked away for 30 years to prevent the public from reading it.

This is always an odd point.  If no one knows what's in the agreement, how are we supposed to use it?  How am I supposed to know if I can export British eggs to the US, if I don't know what we've agreed on?  Other FTAs like [CETA are publicly available](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf).  Do you have a source for this?  No confidentiality agreements have been signed according to EP President Martin Schulz, so there should be no reason not to publish the text of the document.  

I hasten to add that it would be a remarkable feat if a document of this importance that is circulated to several thousand people in 28 EU countries, the US and the EP does not leak in the two years it is expected to take to ratify.  I'm that at least the Pirate Party MEPs would see to that if it's necessary.


The plan is to ratify the agreement after passing it through both houses.  [Under part 2 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, the government will have 21 days to review the legislation](http://www.parliament.uk/Templates/BriefingPapers/Pages/BPPdfDownload.aspx?bp-id=sn06688, http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;ved=0CEMQFjAG&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.uk%2Fbriefing-papers%2Fsn06688.pdf&amp;ei=eZEqVda8HYPuarePgIgH&amp;usg=AFQjCNElFYVjfZyS4KS557fJgUoJMHCUDA&amp;sig2=ycD3uvbIQHMeQv-bRPGJ5Q&amp;bvm=bv.90491159,d.d2s).  It will be debated in both the Lords and the Commons.  Are you suggesting the debate will be behind closed doors?  If so, why?  The ratification process across Europe is expected to take over 2 years and will likely be debated in all the parliaments.

&gt; Moreover, those highly skilled migrants which move to the UK are still coming here despite the high taxes and there being plenty of other English speaking countries which have lower taxes. This suggests that taxes aren't their main concern when moving to the UK and it is most likely due to cultural/societal reasons.

That's a horrendously naive statement. There are hundreds of factors that you don't control for and basically make the conclusion ""it's not taxes so it must be culture."" You think the majority of people moving here do so at an economic sacrifice because they enjoy the culture? Are you insane? 

People move here with the main incentive of earning more money or at least getting a job. Tax is irrelevant, income tax in Poland could be 1% and you could still earn more in England with 45%.

Freeing trade means that everyone can focus on what they do best (i.e. best value for money) and we can sell it.  For example, we do financial services well and we do coal mining badly.  If we extracted coal, it's relatively expensive, so we couldn't sell it abroad and if we made our companies buy it, it would drive electricity prices up.  Instead, someone else mines the coal and sells it to us more cheaply.  In return, we sell them our financial services.  Because we aren't wasting effort making coal no one will buy, we can focus more effort on selling financial services that people will buy.  In the end the consumer gets a better value product.

With specific reference to TTIP, EU countries and the US trade **a lot**. The EU exports €296.4B to the US and imports €206.3B.

But if you look at the media as a spectrum, there are plenty of outlets which are more left wing. The fact they simply aren't as popular isn't some grand conspiracy to alter public opinion, it's because fewer people are willing to pay for what they're selling.

You can't just throw terms like ""the media"" around as if it's a single body.

Care to explain to me what is okay to spend money on and why you take that view point. 

&gt;You seem to think people should take it as their duty yet if I'm earning £1 million a year I won't be using public transport, won't be using the NHS, won't really be using anything public sector thus making most of my taxes a waste of my own money.

You use public roads, your workers use the NHS and you was born in a NHS hospital.  Education was likely to be state funded etc etc etc 
Indirectly you're using services which come out of others pockets.  If everybody stops paying most of these services don't have the money to carry on. 

&gt; Its like a charity right now. If you don't work I'll pay your benefits so you can live how you like, smoking, drinking, going on holidays etc.

Charity in which you have to jump through hoops in order to get any money and money can be stopped.  You don't even get that much money.  Very much doubt you been on benefits or know people who have been.  

&gt; Would you pay a charity you don't like/agree with? No? Then my point is correct.
What public sector spending do you disagree with? And why?

&gt; If I were to work hard on a minimum wage job and there are people on benefits earning more than me and being supported more than me who go on more holidays and buy more stuff.

What about the people who are richer than you getting more support?

&gt; Your point about how you shouldn't be able to do business if you don't pay tax will again push people away from the UK and they will do business elsewhere, thus ruining the economy.

Only going to hurt inflated profit margins profit and unfair competitive tax advantages. Just like the minimum wage won't have a negative impact.

This means that large sums have been made available for companies like a a shade greener to offer free panels. They take the payments over 20 years. You get the free electricity. Free electricity yay! How could there be a downside?

Well there are a few. You're entering into a lease for 20 years, so they own the panels on the roof. They want those panels working for the entire time, because if the panels aren't working, they're not getting paid. Therefore if you want to make roof repairs or change your mind, you're likely to have to pay a penalty. I'm not sure about a shade greener in particular but I've known some contracts to include steep penalties. The penalties are large enough to wipe out any benefit you get from the free electricity. 

For reference, every kWp will save you about £65/yr in bills. They tend to look to install 4kWp systems. So you're looking at about £260/yr max. 

The other big problem is if you come to sell you house. A rational buyer would understand the lease and the benefits. But house buying decisions aren't always rational. People get nervous easily. If you have to include tons of documents and declarations about this lease a random company has for equipment on your roof (including penalty clauses) it might put people off. This is one of the biggest risks IMO. And potentially not worth the cash you'll save if you can't sell your house or have to discount capital to persuade people. 

Alternatively, solar panels fully owned by the property owner are quite an incentive when buying. You have a system that can generate between £500-2000 tax free, index linked for 20 years. A lot of people see that as a big positive, but it still takes some explanation. The intricacies of solar and the FIT aren't understood by the vast majority of the population.

Then the BBC took their licence back and there were even more books.  Occasionally other things would happen.  Webcasts, for example.

The EU member states gave the EC a negotiating mandate, which are the parameters within which the EU is allowed to negotiate, what they can give up, and what they want out of it. 

&gt;Once the agreement has been made the government will have a short scrutiny period but ALL documents are then locked away for 30 years to prevent the public from reading it. Can you think of a single justification for locking the documents away for 30 years?

Complete and utter garbage. The negotiating documents will be secret - because public officials dont want people to know what they were willing to negotiate on. If you offer to lower steel tariffs to zero, regardless of whether you actually meant this or whether it was just a negotiating tactic you will forever be branded an enemy of the steel lobby. So for this reason, the interim documents are kept secret. But the final agreement will be made public *for more than a year before it's even voted on in the EP*.

When the McGann movie came out, I was excited and hoped it'd turn into more, but it didn't and I went on being a fan of something I didn't expect to get more canon. My parents and I would check out episodes on VHS from the library fairly frequently.

I was a weird kid who loved off-the-air TV shows (TV Land and Nick at Nite were my favorite), so it wasn't really weird to me, specifically, to just like and obsess on a show that was over.

I eventually discovered Big Finish, but could never really get into it. (Still can't. I would love to and have tried, but I just can't concentrate on audio-only things.)

And then I heard it was coming back and could hardly believe it! Of course, being American...almost no one I knew had ever heard of it, let alone got excited about it. So I was kind of alone in my excitement outside my family.

**Two Level Game Theory**

2LG is pretty much the authoritative theory on success in international negotiation. As you can see from a quick google scholar search, the theory has been cited in academic works [over six thousand times](http://scholar.google.pl/scholar?q=Diplomacy+and+domestic+politics%3A+the+logic+of+two-level+games&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5), so it's not some crack-pot minor theory no one has ever heard of. For those that are curious, there's a link to it [here](http://portal.uam.es/portal/page/portal/UAM_ORGANIZATIVO/Departamentos/CienciaPoliticaRelacionesInternacionales/personal/fernando_rodrigo/pagina_personal_fernando_rodrigo/teoria_relaciones_inter/Textos/Putnam-%20The%20Logic%20of%20Two-Level%20Games.pdf) if you'd like to give it a more thorough browse. It will provide a much more and precise explanation than the one that I hope to give, and it's only thirty pages so it's not very long. I very much recommend all of you read it. 

What 2LG essentially stipulates is that there are two levels of playing field in international negotiation; the domestic, and the international. In the domestic playing field, groups are formed to apply pressure on the government to adopt favourable policies (these groups may be anything, from companies and NGOs, to public or party opinion - the important thing is not to just consider them to be organized, clearly delineated groups), whilst politicians seek to get the power to push the agreement through by building consensus amongst the groups. The international playing field, however, is where the national governments want to alleviate their domestic constituents concerns, whilst at the same time ensuring that the development of the policies of other parties in the negotiation does not adversely affect their constituencies and power bases.   

One of the clearest ways to represent this is through ‘win-sets’. A win-set is the full spectrum of acceptable outcomes to the party in question. Thus, in a two level game, the possible win-set for the international negotiation is in large part dependant on the range of acceptable outcomes in the level 2 negotiation; that is, the larger each of the negotiating parties level 2 win-set is, the more likely they'll overlap with the other parties in a place where both sides are satisfied with an agreement. Perhaps the best way for you guys to visualize it is through a [Venn Diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Venn_A_intersect_B.svg/1280px-Venn_A_intersect_B.svg.png), except imagine that there are 12 actors and they all have to overlap in one spot. 

Now, the reason the negotiations are conducted in secret is to keep each of these Venn Diagram bubble countries as large as possible. Each time one of their possible negotiating is constrained, they get smaller, and thus less likely to overlap with all of the 11 other actors potentially leading to deadlock or abandonment of the agreement. This can be especially troubling if the negotiations were done in public, with every individual, every company, every lobbyist, knowing at each stage what is being discussed and what has been provisionally agreed to. 

**Minimizing lobbying**.

Thus, for negotiations to be succesful win-sets need to be maximized, which means minimizing the influence of vested interests during the negotiation process. Imagine the following scenario. 

The party governing a country gets a lot of its funding from a certain demographic, say dairy farmers. Dairy farmers have access to the text (under this public text proposal of the Greens), and see there's something they don't like there. Maybe dairy tariffs will be lowered. Maybe their export subsidies will be cancelled. Maybe they'll lose Protected Designation of Origin status. Whatever, they don't like it. So the Dairy Union Lobby launches a massive advertising campaign trying to scare the shit out of Joe Public about the new treaty, whilst simultaneously threatening the ruling party about how they're going to fund the opposition if this goes through.

So, ruling party of course says that that clause can no longer be part of the treaty. Except imagine this multiplied amongst every industry sector of every country negotiating. It'd be an absolute clusterfuck, twelve countries all drawing red-lines over certain issues would lead to a treaty with absolutely zero teeth, and everyone would wonder what the fuss was about because it would really amount to nothing.

And I'd also like to preempt the comments of ""but the corporations are already heavily involved"". Those aren't corporations that are hammering out the deals. What actually happens it that a number of different industry specialists are part of consultative groups (for example one on agriculture, one on chemicals, one on pharmaceuticals), as are consumer rights groups, environmental groups, and others. There's nothing clandestine or shady about it, but if you're coming up with a deal that's going to change tens of billions of dollars in trade, then you definitely want to get a sense of how it would effect various stakeholders, and those stakeholders give input on those elements of a treaty. Joe Citizen generally doesn't have the knowledge, nor the expertise, nor the specialization, to be able to have a meaningful input into how a given provision would affect environmental standards, or consumer standards, or the steel industry, or the chemical industry. But just as representatives of key sectors are given some access, so too are consumer rights groups, environmental groups, and the like. Groups like the Consumers Union, and for the environment, the Center for International Environmental Law (and CIEL is world renowned organization) are part of the group as well, are they to be viewed the same way? They're all under strict NDAs and security clearances. If they talk to people about it, they're going to prison for a long time, as well as paying a huge fine. It makes sense to have representatives of those most affected taking part.",null,0,null,1428856979,null,0,false,0,cq9w6y2,null,t3_32bdez,null,t1_cq9w6y2,null,t1_cq9sccj,null,null,null,1432348236,null,26,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,26,null

This meritocracy sounds fantastic on paper but we don't live in a society like this unfortunately. Jobs today, and considering this tax change, large companies pay their employees based on *how much* they generate for the company.

This is why there is a huge disparity, for example the average CEO earns just above £150,000 in the UK excluding bonuses and benefits. However the CEO of banks such as Barclays (cliche I know) earn an awful lot more. 

Your pay isn't based on the fact that you did or didn't go to university or that you do or don't work 40 hours a week, but it's based on what you generate for a company. If you make a £400,000 sale as a broker you get paid a wage and commission appropriate to the fact that you just earned your company 400k.

There are other reasons why the position based fixed pay doesn't work as well, but realistically it's not going to happen unless the system is radically changed. I personally don't have a huge problem with it at the middle level, I mean if I'm a better salesperson that my equally qualified colleague I should still earn more.

Hymns generally sound nice. That's why they are sung. You might not like them, but plenty of people do. Turns out a couple of thousand years of monopolising the best singers and songwriters mean you end up with some good quality songs.

As to a religious school, obviously there is a sliding scale between crazy cults and harmless religious and cultural education which teaches them to be nice, good to others and make the most out of life. I would not send them to the former, I would very much like the latter. I don't have the benefit of choosing the magical secular alternative atheists claim they want to make which does the same without God, because none of them have bothered to make one in my catchment area yet.

Monarchy, I find it to be an exceptionally effective constitutional tool which outsources plenty of the pomp, circumstances, non-political and pointless crap associated with being a head of state that provides stability, continuity and an alternative interpretation of civic nationalism that is not linked to the dominant politician of the time. They stop us from being just another irrelevant European Republic, and I like the history of it. 

Bishops in the Lords; religion and morality is important in general life to a lot of people and there are specific aspects of legislation and public life that one needs specialist knowledge about the church for. I think there is a role for religion in politics, but would prefer the church to not get involved in the election side of things. Having a small number of individuals who are generally of a far better quality than the average peer intervening on specific issues there to answer such questions, yet being statistically irrelevant and unable to write legislation seems to me to be a good thing.

Anyway. None of this is really surprising. UKIP are the most car centric party by a country mile. They usually see any encouragement of any other (free/cheap/healthy) mode of transport as an attack on their lifestyle/ideals.

null,false,APersoner,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"I'm assuming you're in Cardiff University, as opposed to UWIC/USW/Glamorgan, but all the areas are the same, I'm just not so certain about transport (I don't live in Cardiff itself anyway, I just happen to know where most of the uni accommodation is).

In Cardiff you're in the area of the world with the highest number of castles per square mile. Check some out! Two that are definitely worth checking out are Cardiff and Caerphilly castle, and Castell Coch isn't terrible (but it's not a 'real' castle). If you break out an OS map you can also check out the ruins of Dinas Powys castle, but that involves trespassing over some barbed wires - head to the Dinas entrance of the woods to see that (again, check out a map to help). Cosmeston Medieval Village is also nearby, and free (like all the castles). It's also where they filmed scenes Merlin, if you've ever seen that.

Check out the Bay and barrage - that's where the Torchwood tower is, and if the weathers nice it's a pretty great place to walk around (also great for running, but a fair way from Cathays). If you want to get around anywhere, just use the trains. My cousin's in the university, and reckons there's a decent bus service to the city centre (only a 20 minute walk anyway). The train service from here is awesome, Penarth has 3 stations, Dinas has 2, Barry has loads, Cardiff has loads, each of the Valleys has their own train line - Cardiff was historically a coal-mining port, so the rail links were needed.

No reason to not check out Bristol sometime, I'm in university there, and with a railcard it costs about £9 for a day return, about an hour journey. A railcard is definitely worth getting since it makes train journeys 30% cheaper. Also check out the Gower sometime - I know there's a train to Swansea, but I'm not sure about public transport on the other end though sorry. Beaches there are amazing.

International sports village is great, swimming pool, white water rafting, and later this year they're meant to finish a fancier ice rink which'll serve as Cardiff Devils (our ice hockey team) new home. Also meant to be an indoor ski slope, dunno when that'll be done. When the Six Nations (rugby union) is on, you'll want to make sure you watch at least one of the games, although town will be packed. Just make sure you're supporting Wales not England! Our local football (assoc) team is Cardiff City FC, but they're doing poorly at the moment. Tickets will be expensive but at least they won't sell out anymore. If you want to do track &amp; field/cross country I recommend joining Cardiff AAC in Leckwith - there's trains to get there or you could walk/cycle, the university isn't amazing for sport, and their best athletes (David Omoregie and Dan Nash off the top of my head) are with the club/self-trained. Uni-sport isn't a big deal here, but I've heard that varsity with Swansea is still highly contested. Actually, on that note, our football rivalry with Swansea is *intense* - just call them jack bastards and we'll all be good.

When the weather's lush (if you don't use that word, you will soon), Barry Island is probably your best local beach. Barry's a *dump* (but I'm from a posh nearby area, so I'm possibly biased), and Gavin &amp; Stacey is pretty much correct, save for their accents since it was filmed there, but the beach is still pretty nice. Still trying to get over the new nickname Barrybados it's been given myself though, jars in my throat haha. Also check out Penarth Pier when the weathers nice, it was recently renovated. You can either catch a train in, or just walk from the far end of the barrage under the cliffs. The cliffs around Penarth/Lavernock side of Cardiff are pretty notable too, first over-water radio transmission, and they're layers of limestone and shale (iirc). They also filmed some scenes of Doctor Who there, and the whole of Sarah Jane Adventures pretty much was filmed in Penarth.

Also, all museums in Wales are free too!

Learn to love Greggs too, Cardiff is *full* of them, and they're cheap calories (cheaper than Subways and much nicer imo). If you have any questions, defo ask since I'm sure I forgot something.

null,false,Humanatee69,swans2002,Ashley Williams,null,"Not much noise has been made, but I think we could get Rudy Gestede from Blackburn for around £5 million. He's a strong target man with a pretty good touch and really fits our mold at striker. Additionally he has been lethal with his chances this season and he's outperformed Jordan Rhodes who is supposed to be a premier league quality striker. 

We can't afford 3-4 million for a back up keeper at this point. Tremmel is fine as cover and soon enough Zabret should be filling that role in my opinion.

Kolodziejczak would be a great signing. I think it would put more pressure on Taylor and even give us an emergency winger if we go throught an injury rut. This move would in all likelihood push Taylor out though. Which I'm iffy on because I quite like the guy and its always good to keep the Welsh identity of the club intact.

World peace is more likely than Aubamayeng coming to Swansea. He's been Dortmund's best offensive player (not named Reus) this season. He's not leaving for less than 25 million and definitely not to a club outside of continental competition. 

Jelavic is a decent shout. At 6million that would be pretty decent business I imagine. I think the name on everyones lips is Aleksander Mitrovic. He'll be £15 million IMO, but I think he'd be worth it. Mitrovic would really make this team a continental challenging squad.

*So for people coming in my shortlist would be:*

- Rudy Gestede, Blackburn, ST

- Aleksander Mitrovic, Anderlecht, ST

- Kolodziejczak, Sevilla, FB

- Martin Olsson, Norwich FB

- Adam Matthews, Celtic, FB

**Out:**

Emnes, and Tiendelli are dead weight. Emnes has utility, but I'd rather give Barrow time that we give him.

Taylor may end up leaving as clubs seem to be swarming over him.

We'll have to fight to keep Fabianski here, but I'm optimistic we can. If Roma is after him though we might have some trouble.

Clubs seem to like Gomis as evidenced by the winter transfer window. Given his spectacular return to form in the Hull game we might see Newcastle, Stoke, Palace etc. weighing him as an option. I can't believe I'm going to say this, but we shouldn't let him go. If nothing else he is an established striker in our system, selling him would leave us with Barrow and Donnelly as familiar strikers. That is putting a lot of pressure on whatever forward we buy.

**CONTRVERSIAL** : I warned you. I think that if we get a good bid for Siggy it might be worth selling him. By good I mean at least 15 million. Shelvey is developing rapidly and Gylfi is not very adaptable. 4-2-3-1 with Siggy in the hole he's an assist machine, however he's failed to adapt especially well to anything else though. He can't play holding midfield, can't play box to box, can't play striker, can't play on the wing. He's been uneffective as anything other than our primary creative outlet and even then he needs a creative partner (ex. Bony). I love Gylfi and I think he's been a great addition this season, but his utility is quite limited. Shelvey is quickly becoming our primary threat from the midfield and unless this diamond is permanent one of the two is going to leave eventually. 

God that hurt to write.

This is probably bad, as those people are by definition the ones who are best at creating wealth. So a progressive tax system, (desirable though it may be for social and moral reasons) has the side effect of slowing down the rate at which wealth is created.  
  
You may well argue that the pros outweigh the cons in this regard, but giving people who are already wealthy enough to not *need* to work, an additional incentive to lie in bed all day is definitely going to affect their output.
