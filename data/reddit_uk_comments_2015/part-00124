He's been good in both of his starts, against Burnley and Everton. He's been dreadful, and I mean, dreadful, any time he's come off the bench, that you're right about. You can tell he's so much more comfortable when he's starting the game, then when he is on coming on as a sub. Every time he's come on as a sub, it's usually in a high tempo game, where he's looking to impress, and it's extremely tough to get acclimated to. 

But in both his starts, he's played fine, in the match against Everton, his link up play was good and he started a few really good counters that resulted in a near chance (IIRC Stones beat Remy to Cuadrado's nice through ball by half a step). Against Burnley, he was roaming throughout the pitch, and he was repeatedly linking up with Hazard, and people forget this because of the missed penalties and the Matic incident, but our attack for most of that game was pretty good, we were creating lots of chances, we just got hosed by **fucking** Martin Atkinson. The other thing I liked is he making runs in behind into the box, which NOBODY on our team does besides Costa which is annoying when we have no box presence, and we end up passing it around the final third of the pitch trying to walk it in. 

You're right about his corner kicks though, there's no fucking way he should ever take a corner kick again. Then again neither should Willian. Fab hasn't been great at them recently. None of our guys recently have hit a corner past the first man, it's annoying as fuck. I'd actually prefer Oscar to take most of the corners now tbh. 

Also I'd argue against a physical overaggressive side like Stoke, having Cuadrado who is better at taking on defenders than Willian, might be better because he can draw some fouls, and that leads to more set piece opportunities to use our height in the box. We're going to have to get chances on set pieces too because we won't have Costa.

(I remember Willian being the prominent one in the everton game and shifting over to the right side to help out juan and brana) In the games where he came on he was like a black hole, our attacks disappeared when the ball reached him because of how easily and cheaply he gave away possession, I'm just saying this is enough to say he shouldn't be given a start next game. The reason I mentioned the physicality was because he was getting muscled off the ball by not-so physical sides like soton and tottenham, and it gives me the impression that he'd be taken out of the game against a rugby side they call stoke. Not to mention the BPL is overall a far more physical league than the serie a, which may be playing a part in his rather slow adaptation.

Because the Doctor is struggling through a massive existential crisis (basically, who and what am I and what am I here for, and what -- good or bad -- have I done?), she steps up to act as a moral compass for him while he needs that, even though at the same time she's got these major concerns about her own life choices.

Actually, the directive is about a lot more than rights to holidays. Why is the question focusing on holiday entitlement?

Also, while I appreciate that they are trying to match extant policies, things like

&gt; Should we stop paying Winter Fuel Payments to pensioners on higher rates of income tax? 

Well, no. I think it should be scrapped outright. It was initially conceived as a one-off bung by Gordon brown to win over the grey vote and its now become entrenched as an entitlement to paper over the fact that energy costs are becoming increasingly affordable. 

Similarly, I dont think Child benefit should be limited to the first two children. That benefit was conceived to increase the post-war birth rate. We dont have a problem with birth rate, in fact the population is growing at a frightening rate - another million people every 3 years - so why are we persisting with this?

I think I've also seen XBMC/Kodi and many forks (VidOn, SPMC, etc) relatively recently add support for blu-rays and a toggle to use the full-menu rather than a generated menu. This relatively recent [guide](http://libregeek.org/2014/01/05/a-guide-to-playing-blu-rays-on-ubuntu-linux) might also be useful to delve into if need be.

If there's yet a way to reliably play/rip blu-rays on linux distros, though, would you be open to dual-boot (or virtual-machine) windows specifically for blu-rays? Reddit has a popular [swap](http://reddit.com/r/microsoftsoftwareswap) to get extremely cheap full retail copies of Windows 7/8 editions for ~$15; which claims to not be an msdn/volume-license scam. I had purchased one from s5ean awhile ago and verified it is a retail license rather than a sketchy volume license; [this](http://theverge.com/2015/3/18/8241023/windows-10-free-for-software-pirates) also looks promising.

Several months ago I had purchased the Doctor Who season 1-7 and 50th anniversary blu-ray box-sets, tediously ran everything through MakeMKV on Windows, stored the video-files on an internal cloud-drive, and (bob's your uncle) can now play them drm-free on any device including a Fire TV and Nexus Player. I would much rather have purchased 1080p digital copies of every new-who episode/special to have an accessible master collection in one place, but the higher-quality versions are still only available via blu-ray for the first ~4 seasons (hence my earlier rant; apologies).

Perhaps the elusive [BBC Store](http://digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/video-post-production/bbc-confirms-bbc-store-sell-tv-shows-boxsets-in-2015-launch-buzzfeed-style-bbc-earth-site) will solve some of these problems if/when it opens its doors to the uk and possibly the world in the not too distant future.

It's America you want to blame for that.

Liberal in the UK always meant ""economical liberal"" (i.e. laissez-faire free-market advocate) right up until the 1970s. At that point in time there was a huge shift in most western countries towards what are today called progressive social policies. In most of Europe that got given the name of democratic socialism, but because the S word is political suicide in the USA they started calling it social liberalism.

And because we share a common language (mostly) with the US that meaning of liberal quickly spread over here. It became even more of a thing once the old Liberal Party joined up with the SDP (oh look, there's that democratic socialism term again). But in the rest of Europe, where they don't speak English and so are less influenced by US media, ""Liberal"" parties are usually closer to what we'd call Conservative in policy.",null,0,null,1428043398,null,0,false,0,cpzr4cy,null,t3_318quu,null,t1_cpzr4cy,null,t1_cpzkhqg,null,null,null,1432169561,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

What they were doing wasn't superficial or obvious, which may be just what viewers expected to find, so they stopped at ""grumpy old man"" and ""bossy control freak"", when there's so much else going on there.  It's not surprising.  Our culture is just starting to come to grips with the idea that it's not true that the only important relationships men and women can have with each other are explicitly romantic ones. Series 8 was an effort to delve deeper, to find something that easily eludes us: levels of affection and bonding that *aren't* based on sex.  I attended a panel on asexuality at a con last year, where people self-identifying as asexual described the disbelief they encounter when they describe their relations with their SO's as powerful and passionate love that's just not expressed through sexual activity.  Think about Slash fanfic, which creates explicitly sexual attraction (and action) between characters who, in their original fictional settings, have strong and caring friendships with each other but not sex (Kirk and Spock, an outstanding example of this Slash trope).  An example of relationships based on non-sexual love and bonding that we do seem able to understand is the bond between soldiers who've been through war together, protecting each other and taking risks together.  That could describe Clara and the Doctor, come to think of it: adventures are full of danger, like battlefields, and you can love your brother-in-arms or a gifted officer with great affection, trust, and loyalty (and efforts to help him be the best person you think he can be, not the worst) without being drawn to sleeping with him.

We're happy to commit to 11 billion in foreign aid, but **how dare** some people feel betrayed when we have such crippling poverty on our doorstep that isn't being addressed, while we squander billions propping up corrupt regimes.

It's pretty disgusting how we've all been manipulated into thinking that putting our citizens first is somehow ""disgusting"" or ""despicable"". Gonna get downvoted to shit for saying anything even remotely positive about UKIP, because this is reddit after all, but who gives a fuck.

I guess what I'm complaining about is more the mindset that somehow that 15m is our absolute hard and fast limit now, as though pure numbers were all that had to do with our recent recruitment failings.  It's the failure to buy players who actually fit in with the side, rather than the dollar figures, that was the most galling thing.  Any fan of La Liga, for example, could've told you that the kind of service Soldado thrived on at Valencia was entirely incompatible with the way AVB intended to play.  So was the miscalculation in the amount or the decision itself?  Had we paid 10m for Bobby, he still wouldn't have been any less of a flop.

I would still like to think that if a player of the equivalent of today's VDV became available for around 20m and was interested in us, that we would stretch to that, even as an exception.

So, in a perfect world, that would mean that you go to one of those, find which party you align with and then vote for that party.

Unfortunately, due to FPTP, that may be utterly pointless. So, if you google ""Your area election results 2010"" then you will find out how each party did last time. Now, as I mentioned, in an ideal world, this wouldn't matter and you'd vote for who the hell you want. (And you probably still should and if everyone did it would be much better).

So, let's say for example that you find that your views align the best with Liberal Democrats first, Green Second, Labour Third with Conservative being like fifth, UKIP sixth and BNP seventh. If you go onto the last election results and find that all parties got about 500 votes apart from Labour and Conservatives where one got 83512 and one got 83511, then you can probably realise that your vote for the Lib Dem isn't going to affect the election, so you might thing ""Well, I like Lib Dem's but out of the two candidates who have an actual chance of winning, I prefer Labour to Conservative, so I'll vote for them"", and so be voting for your third choice party just because they stand a chance.

Enoch Powell is the latest – conveniently dead – politician to be accused of awful crimes. This nonsense has to stop

As headlines go it was a belter. “Enoch Powell accused of satanic sex abuse,” the Mail reported at the weekend. “Bishop of Durham gave his name to Met detectives.”

Bishops are sedate and careful creatures, you might think, not given to being impulsive. If the Bishop of Durham (for it was he) passed on Enoch Powell’s name — along with those of Thatcher’s home secretary Willie Whitelaw and the Labour MP Leo Abse — to the authorities, then he must have had reason to do so.

Durham had the names from Dominic Walker, the former Bishop of Monmouth, who in turn, he revealed, got them from three individuals claiming to be victims of abuse whom he had counselled as a parish priest in the 1980s. As the Mail put it, this new story had “emerged amid mounting claims of a paedophile network involving Establishment figures”.

Except the story wasn’t new. And the details of where it came from, how it emerged and how it was reported then tell us a great deal about what is beginning to feel to me like a period of collective madness; a madness in which almost any dead politician or celebrity can be accused of anything, and — for the most part — no one asks “where’s the concrete evidence?”

I am indebted to the debunking website Swallowing the Camel and to a blogger called Richard Bartholomew for having noticed in old reports what so many others missed. And here’s the story.

In 1983 a confidence trickster called Derry Mainwaring Knight appeared in a parish five miles from Brighton and convinced the vicar and several wealthy parishioners that he was a defecting satanist who wanted to destroy the demonic organisation — “the Sons of Lucifer” — to which he had belonged. Pretending to need money to purchase and destroy satanic artefacts, he hornswoggled the gullible Christians out of tens of thousands of pounds.

It couldn’t last. He was rumbled, tried and sentenced to seven years in prison and fined £75,000. However, part of his defence was to claim that three of his fellow cult members had been — wait for it — Enoch Powell, Leo Abse and Willie Whitelaw. The same three names which others apparently vouchsafed to the vicar at about the same time.

In 1991 a journalist called Tim Tate published (and then, after legal action, pulped) a book called Children for the Devil: Ritual Abuse and Satanic Crime. It carried an interview with Bishop Walker who claimed to have met troubled people who had been involved in satanic cults and who had told him “the names of those they say were involved. Sometimes... they are the names of famous or highly respected people.”

In the wake of the Savile revelations in 2013, a child sex abuse campaigner recalled this passage in Tate’s book and wrote to the Bishop of Durham demanding that he “ensure that Dominic Walker contacts the police as a very high priority”. The Church of England sought this week to emphasise that, by complying, “it was not making any judgment but simply fulfilling its responsibility to pass on information when it is widely known that the police are conducting a serious investigation into the possibility of past abuse by politicians, including the possible cover up of some stories”.

In other words, the church passed on the allegations without the smallest notion of whether they might be true, for fear of being accused of covering up if it didn’t. And so Enoch Powell’s reputation was trashed by the 30-year-old inventions of a convicted conman.

Well, this is it. Crunch time. If we drop 8 points behind United then I think top 4 is over. This is an absolutely massive game. Up there with our games versus City and Chelsea last season. If we get Top 4 again this season then I will be a lot more optimistic about our general direction. I was one of Rodgers' biggest crititcs at the start of the season and I'm happy to eat humble pie. I think he is the right man for the job and I'm looking forward to seeing what he achieves at this club. That said, if we finish outside the Top 4 this season then it makes his job much more difficult. Without Top 4 we can't bring in the quality of players we need. 

I have to say I'm not overly confident about this game. Arsenal are in good form, bar a shocking first leg performance against Monaco. Skrtel's suspension is more than annoying. He gets quite a lot of stick on here but when he is on his game he can be the difference between a clean sheet and conceding. I will be watching Sterling with interest, nothing to do with his contract but at 20-years old he is one of our big players and with Sturridge looking iffy he might have to provide the goal. Coutinho will be just as important, if he is marked out of the game then we are in trouble.

Secondly the amount of pure speculation and conjecture is staggering. There is no evidence that Sterling has demanded any specific salary and even less so that he's considering moves elsewhere.

Thirdly are the factual errors.  You report Arsenal made a bid of £40m + £0.01 for Sterling. I presume you mean the bid they made for Suarez in the summer not Sterling. You also report the 'issue' with being played at wing back. This has been the case in the last 2/3 games whilst Ibe has been injured and he has often rotated with other players such as Lallana during these games.  Whilst he might not consider it his best position (clearly it isnt) you report it as though this is his main position for Liverpool.

It's fine to speculate and draw out possible scenarios but as far as possible these should be based from a factual basis, not rehased from other sources and incorrect facts.

I liked Capaldi from the start -- my style of guy, the greyhound model rather than the doberman -- but I've found since that re-watching just deepens my admiration and respect for the skills and talents of the actor and his writers, and my enjoyment of the Doctor they've created.

Peter Capaldi is amazing at creating a convincing impression of depth and reality -- maybe it's that he's a virtuoso performing on a spectacular set of instruments (I mean the instruments common to all actors: body, face, voice, and a sense I don't have a word for but  that's about pacing and space).  I think the high quality of his work encourages the best in his colleagues (Jenna excelled, making her Clara more and more real throughout Series 8).  It also creates layers of nuance that you might not fully ""get"" until you look again, attentively, and step slightly outside of the story to see how it works. That's one reason that re-watching is so effective.

For example, the volcano scene in Dark Water. The Doctor refuses to give in to Clara's threats, then calls her bluff -- ""Throw away the key!"" -- with a dismissive gesture (see if I care!).  When we learn that the volcano was an illusion that he created, that moment changes in meaning.  The emotional charge didn't come from a furious recklessness on his part about losing the Tardis, since that threat was never real except in Clara's distraught mind. What's powerful is the Doctor being determined to force Clara to choose -- loyalty her friend and companion, or loyalty to dead Danny -- regardless of the consequences. He's enraged that she has turned on him this way, but when she does throw the last key and insists that she's sorry but she'd do it again, he doesn't just relent.  He melts.

Anger vanishes in the pain of being not just betrayed but decisively rejected in favor of Danny. It's replaced by compassion for powerful grief that has driven her to such extremity, and remorse for his own part in breaking her down this way.

""Look in your hand,"" he says.  His expression softens with remorse for having selfishly pushed her so hard.  His voice is suddenly gentle, a bit rough with empathy for her misery.  ""Yes, yes, yes, look -- "" He's not actually saying, ""There there, it's all right"" (because it isn't) but something much more concise and useful: the keys are fine, there is no volcano. The Impossible Man has a deep streak of fine Scots practicality in him: hard information trumps sentiment even on the rim of a volcano.

UKIP included.

From their policy page.

&gt;– Migrants will only be eligible for benefits (in work or out of work)  when they have been paying tax and NI for five years and will only be eligible for permanent residence after ten years.

Just off the top of my head that sounds similar to Labour's policy just different in time scale. I think there's was 2 years.

&gt;The tuition fees stuff...we have no idea how that went down behind closed doors. It almost certainly wasn't the case that Clegg was like, once he had a foot in number 10, *Fooled those cunts, £9k please!* 

There was compromise. The deal was lib dems could vote yes to the increase, or they could abstain. They couldn't vote no. They voted yes.

&gt;As the junior coalition member you have to assume that a lot of compromise was had, and maybe he was just outmanouvred on this one. Who knows. For me, at least, it's no enough to call him a liar and a promise-breaker because the reality is almost certainly more complicated.

Oh they definitely got out manoeuvred, they got completely shanked this term. They had enough power to be meat shields, they alienated their voters by basically turning their lib dem vote into a conservative one. 

The biggest concession they got from the Tories was the referendum on AV, which they then got battered with when it happened shortly after the tuition fee debacle. The conservatives turned that referendum into party politics at a time when sentiment against the lib dems was an all time high, of course the vote came back no. 

The liberal democrats and Clegg compromised nearly every aspect of their policies and went back on their pledge by voting yes (not abstaining like they could have) to tuition fees in an attempt to gain political capital to use later in the term, it didn't work. They lost the trust of the electorate and worse, they all but consigned the referendum to a ""no"" vote. So we're stuck with this bullshit FPTP system that is clearly inherently broken.

&gt;**Save As You Earn (SAYE)**
&gt; 
&gt; This is a savings-related share scheme where you can buy shares with your savings for a fixed price.
&gt; 
&gt; You can save up to £500 a month under the scheme. At the end of your savings contract (3 or 5 years) you can use the savings to buy shares. The tax advantages are:
&gt; 
&gt; the interest and any bonus at the end of the scheme is tax-free
&gt; you don’t pay Income Tax or National Insurance on the difference between what you pay for the shares and what they’re worth
&gt; 
&gt; You might have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you sell the shares - but not if you put them into an Individual Savings Account (ISA) or pension as soon as you buy them.

With regards to ISA:

&gt; **Transferring your shares to an ISA**
&gt; 
&gt; You can transfer up to £15,000 of employee shares into a stocks and shares Individual Savings Account (ISA) if you have shares in a:
&gt; 
&gt;* Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme
&gt;* Share incentive plan (SIP)
&gt; 
&gt; Your ISA provider must agree to the transfer.
&gt; 
&gt; You won’t have to pay Capital Gains Tax on any gains you make on your shares if you move them to an ISA.
&gt; 
&gt; You must transfer your shares to your ISA within 90 days of when you took out your SIP or SAYE shares.
&gt; 
&gt; These shares will count towards your £15,000 ISA limit. They can’t be in addition to the limit.
&gt; 
&gt; Ask your employer or ISA provider for more information on how to transfer.

Back-of-a-napkin calculation says you can transfer £15k of your £17k into an ISA and pay no CGT, leaving the final £2k subject to CGT. Assuming you've made no gains in the tax year this is far below your allowance (and, in fact, the gain on the whole share save scheme will probably fall below your allowance, which is £11,000ish).

Keep good records of all dealings with your landlord, and try to get all actions on his part and yours confirmed in writing with appropriate notice.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/election-2015-32164815

I think everyone came across quite well last night. It's really good to see a proper mix of parties being represented. My thoughts:- 

- Shame Natalie is in charge of Green party, she's a bit rubbish at public speaking.
- SNP have that strong Scottish oomph we all know and love, looks like their party leader is a good representation of the people of scotland and I hope they do quite well out of that debate as far as seats are concerned.
- Farage lol. Let's not treat people (if they're not british) with HIV? That's how you get MORE HIV in britain you pleb. What a nob.
- Clegg came across quite likeable I thought and I think it's good he took a jab at Cameron when he disagreed and stood by the 'Let's finish what we started'-ness of things when he felt that was right. You can tell he'd rather not share with the conservatives but at least he understands that the country needs a bit of stability at the moment.
- Plaid Cymru was a bit nervous. I'm sure they'll get better and stronger with time though and it's definitely good they were featured in the aspects of fairness.
- Miliband. Did quite well actually. I used to hate him but he seemed quite strong. Labour do seem to have come along quite well under his leadership but I don't think shaking the whole country up again is ever good for us in this situation. We're on the rise we don't want to collapse that for a year and start from scratch.
- Cameron. He's still a nob. But I think he's a nob that is a good strong leader. The fucking tax breaks for wealthiest is sickening and hopefully with enough pressure that could still be addressed under his government. I hate to say i'm siding with the tories but I truly do think we should at least finish another full term of the stuff we're going through, if at least to pull the country's socks up and strengthen us again. All though some shifting needs to definitely be done at some point. I don't think it's good hitting a COMPLETE change in government right now.",null,0,null,1428054749,null,0,false,0,cpztlwo,null,t3_318h6z,null,t1_cpztlwo,null,t3_318h6z,null,null,null,1432170734,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

- Cutting council tax

- Restrictions on alcohol purchasing

- A ""Football Act"" which, regardless of intent, is pretty much an attack on free speech

- Wide sweeping centralisation of power

- With some exceptions (as some members voted in favour), a rejection of the ""End of Life Assistance Bill""

- No desire for any nationalisation within the party. Criticised for alluding to rail nationalisation (to win votes no doubt) then continuing the franchise. [EDIT: Apparently Scotland is waiting for rail powers to be devolved so can do little at this moment in time]

I'd like to remind people that the SNP only call themselves ""Social-Democrats"" because before then they were known as the ""Tartan Tories""

Also, a little bit of history. The SNP worked with the Tories in the 1970s to take down Labour's Callaghan government.

They might offer Theo Walcott in exchange of this unhappy forward. Earlier Man City manager Manuel Pellegrini expressed his interest in the young talent. He addressed the media that City would like to spend £100m to land him at Etihad.

It's a bit of a jump to go from what he said to what you're claiming.

&lt;3

I live in Wales and am voting Plaid. That said, I was a little disappointed with Leanne's performance last night. She isn't a bad speaker but she doesn't have the delivery required to thrive in that loud, interruption-riddled debate style. It's too easy for people to speak over her and drown her out. Nicola Sturgeon on the other hand has very good delivery - in that regard and hopefully that regard alone, she's obviously taken a page from Thatcher's book.

I think there were only three rounds of applause for things purple said in the debate last night. One was for Wood/Plaid and one was for Sturgeon/SNP, which restores a little of my faith in, well, that studio audience anyway. I just found myself wishing I could put words into their mouths some of the time because they missed some great opportunities to make really impactful, soundbite-friendly statements.

Because 1 in 5 people in West Belfast aren't disabled. 

&gt; West Belfast is one of the most deprived areas in the country. The health of the working class is significantly worse than the health of the upper classes. 

Yes, I agree with you. 

As for your demands that I back up my ""fear mongering"" (what fear mongering are you referring to, by the way?) how about you back up your statistics? If you think 0.7% of benefit claims throughout the UK are fraudulent, what specific relevance to West Belfast does this have? Are you trying to say it's only 0.7% in West Belfast? Would you like to back that claim up with any evidence? I'll be waiting.

&gt; Maybe people with disabilities move to West Belfast to take advantage of the cheap housing, no longer able to afford their semi in the south? 

Maybe this, maybe that. I can't imagine there are many people handing over the keys to their Malone detached just because those West Belfast rates bills are so enticingly low! I get your point, but it looks like you're more interested in rationalising this silly number than having anything resembling a normal discussion.

Who knows. I know loads of westies taking the piss on DLA, so let's not pretend it isn't rampant just because you want to play the hero of the working class. I am about as left wing as it gets, but even I'm not going to fall for the moronic argument that one in five fucking westies are disabled. It's absurd.

Now, about what we're going to do about it? Well, that would involve our government creating opportunities for us. And since when has that been their goal? As West Belfast consistently votes Sinn Fein and Sinn Fein have evidently done fuck all for them, maybe the residents of West belfast and Sinn Fein should be the target of your ire, rather than someone who made a 2 line comment effectively saying they didn't begrudge people playing the system as long as its not in-your-face obvious. Which this is. Have a bit of fucking subtlety, like - not too much to ask.

Or is it actually nothing to do with any of that, and it's just ""don't ever attack any cynical behavior ever because West Belfast, as the city's Republican heartland, is inherently above reproach and must always be defended"" - because that attitude's been around for decades and it helps no one, least of all the people of west Belfast. I don't think you were doing that particularly, but that nonsense has directly contributed to the absolute lack of real change, opportunity and prospects for those brought up in the west of the City. It's fucking shameful. And you want to attack me? Away on.

Not everyone who claims disability living allowance is in a fucking wheelchair. It's *all* debilitating illnesses, mental and physical. You don't have ***any*** idea how many are actually disabled. How many do you think are actually disabled? I want a number.

&gt;Yes, I agree with you completely. I don't think you have any evidence whatsoever to back up the number that 1 in 5 poor people are actually disabled, though.

Eh, the fact that they get DLA? They have to get approval from government doctors. It's not easy to claim it fraudulently, despite what you read in the DailyMail.

&gt;1 in 5 people? Get a grip.

Well, as I said it's 1 in 10 in the richest area in the country and if you read the article, North Belfast and Tyrone are not too far behind. The statistics for the rest of the U.K. are all pretty similar too. 

As I said, 0.7% of benefits are claimed fraudulently. So if anything, your problem is with the government definition of who qualifies as disabled. Take that up with Westminster, not the people of West belfast 

You absolutely are fear-mongering. *'Look at all the scrounging tramps in the West taking our hard earned tax for sitting on their arses all day! There's absolutely nothing wrong with them,. get a job!'*

If anything, the better the SNP do the better the Tories do at Labours expense - as after 5 years of being told it would be UKIP that squeezes the tories, it seems it's actually labour that are being squeezed by the SNP in what were traditionally safe labour seats. 

Personally, whatever your political orientation I would caution against buying into this holier-than-thou ""left of centre"" paradise the SNP claim to be driving for. The reality is they are a one issue party, and that one issue is independence. In the same way that UKIP might have policies about education, the reality is we all know theirs is a party based around separation from the EU. Similar thinking can be found in the SNP - whilst they do have policies and a manifesto (that purports to be left of centre) the reality is they are a party that makes every single decision on the basis of ""Does this help the case for independence?"". That is their ultimate test. Not, ""Is this good for voters"" or even ""Is this good for our voters?"". They will not be happy until they achieve independence, it's their *raison d'etre*.  

It's interesting the media have run with the story so much. In reality Sturgeon did ""okay"" in the polls, and was broadly in line with Cameron, Farage and Miliband. I think the real story from last night was how poorly Clegg did... whilst he didn't make any slip-ups he probably cemented his parties fate in the upcoming election. Essentially he had nothing new to offer and struggled to defend his parties record in office. Ironically he seemed to try harder to defend the incumbent government than Cameron actually did. Miliband landed a solid broadside on him with the tuition fees remark and his retort about the economy didn't really hit home like he'd obviously hoped.

I would be very suprised. 

I think a Labour-SNP coalition or confidence and supply deal would be suicidal for labour... it would basically be sending a message that they are finished as a serious party in Scotland for the foreseeable future... and are prepared to shoot themselves in the foot in England in order to try and squeeze into power. The only thing a Labour-SNP deal will do is help secure the strongest Tory government afterwards - probably under Boris Johnson after the inevitable Cameron leadership challenge. 

From an English perspective, as a guy who has voted for labour twice in recent memory, I wouldn't vote for them again if they went into a coalition with the SNP. They are the most despicable political group in the UK at the moment.

Any majority government or coalition can whip its members to push through any number of terrible things. I think that needs to end. If a bill can only pass on merit, perhaps a few of them might actually have some. 

2. It's hard to say. Labour's attitude to the SNP has been pretty pathetic. Obviously if they say they will work with the SNP, that's an open admission that Scottish Labour is done for. On the other hand, Scottish Labour is done for. The people of Scotland at least want to move to the left. Lib/Lab wouldn't be the end of the world. Lib/SNP is unlikely and would probably drag the SNP through the mud like Con/Lib has with the LibDems - another whipping/coalition issue.

My reasons are that I don't think it's a good idea to buy a property in a place where the prices are at historical highs, and most importantly, a city where I don't see myself living in the long term. A house should first and foremost be a home, and when you're buying at these prices, it will most likely be your home for quite some time. I just don't see myself sticking with London long enough to justify living in a shitty 1 bed flat, with no garden and probably terrible neighbours. At these prices buying for an investment doesn't really make sense, so unless you are buying it to live in for a decent chunk of time I wouldn't bother.

When buying a home you loose about 5% of the value immediately in tax and fees. Then there's the cost of a huge mortgage. After adding these costs onto the asking price of a shitty 1 bed in a terrible area in London, it becomes clear to me that it's too expensive for enjoying the advantages of being a home owner. 

You say you're already in index funds, I would keep on doing that, while making sure they're well diversified across asset classes and location. Historically, equities have out performed the housing market. Good luck!

These areas also tend to be a very long way from the dense population centres where the power is needed, meaning more pylons crisscrossing the country.

Damming up rivers on a massive scale also prevents nutrients flowing downstream which is bad for agriculture in the area and leads to increased fertilizer use.

Politically, we'll have more of a say in how the country is run, being 1/6th of the voice instead of 1/36th.

Economically, we will no longer compete with Dublin on an unequal basis. Yes, we are getting investment, but theres a reason MS, Google et al have their EU HQ in Dublin and not Belfast. There is a reason many people bus down south to fly abroad rather than take the same route from Belfast International. If we are under the same tax code as Dublin, we can pull some of that investment and spending up North more easily.

Infrastructure wise, well we've a single Energy market, gas market etc all in place or underway.

Lets say you're looking for a 1 bed flat, £250k is probably about average, but I suspect a lot higher in most cases.

However, this is assuming the bank will even lend you that. They tend to only lend around 3-4.5x times your gross income, so realistically on £35k a year, they're probably going to lend you between £105k (worst case) to £157,500 (best case)

They used to have some good investigative journalism and real social issue critiques, but now it is basically the bastion of the north London academic liberal elite. Stuffed with legions of privileged hereditary media moguls who look down their noses from their great ivory towers sneering, belittling and degrading others. They imply that anyone who holds a different view to their own is somehow heartless, stupid, or prejudiced (or a mix of all three). They are so enshrined in their own elite liberal snobbery and believe themselves to be so enlightened as if they have some kind of monopoly on morality and justice. They are the masters of hypocrisy, sensationalism and scaremongering on par with the Daily Mail but perhaps done more subtly. Their comments section is full of absolute nutters and dissenting opinion is regularly censored by the moderators.

1) They always castigate people for tax evasion/avoidance. The Guardian Media Group it set up through various holding holding companies based in the Cayman Islands and paid almost no tax on an £800m windfall a few years ago. They did post in defense of it, that what they did was legal, but this is the kind of stuff they abuse people for on a regular basis.

2) They constantly rail against both private schools and Oxbridge, despite the fact it is almost impossible to write for them unless you have been to both. They rally against nepotism and the supposed elite who sort out all the best jobs for their friends and kids, unless you happen to be the editors daughter - Bella Mackie who is Alan Rusbridger's daughter, writes for the Guardian and uses a false name to try and hide the nepotism.

In a country such as the UK, the area is so small that it is likely that when one wind turbine is generating energy, most of them are across the country.  This causes huge swings from zero to near max energy.  When most of the wind turbines are generating electricity the market price for it crashes meaning that they can't make money without subsidy.

I'd like to see more research in what we can do when that happens.  I think one of the best things right now would be to feed the live market price of electricity to consumers with electric cars.  If Tesla cars could receive data on the current electricity price; and charge accordingly then it might be able to help balance things out.  Another good user would be those properties with electric heating.  They could warm up a degree or two higher when the wind is blowing; so that the energy gets absorbed into the house and doesn't need heating for a while afterwards when it dies down.

As far as renewable energy goes I've got more hope in the tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay.

19 countries, and no, just that NI would be just as irrelevant, perhaps if Ireland left the Euro and returned to the punt but that doesn't seem very likely. 

I like what Robert Kennedy said about GDP ""it measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile""; it says nothing about the quality of those jobs. HDI, Gini, GDP per capita, better measures of the wealth and fairness of a country are all better in the ROI that the UK (not sure how that breaks down for Northern Ireland).

&gt; A large econemy can facilitate more trade, more infasturcture. You're giving me ""reasons"" why we shouldn't be in the UK but none of why we should be in the Republic.

Infrastructure like HS2, that will be good for Northern Ireland won't it. You only need to compare Northern Ireland's motorway and railway network to the ROI to see who has the better infrastructure, doesn't seem unreasonable to think a motorway from Dublin to Londonderry would have been built at the same time as the other motorways in the ROI; they may end up paying for it yet.

If Celtic can't continue to attract as many fans without them, that isn't the fault of anyone else, you'll just have to deal with it.  I'm certainly not going to be upset about it.

I don't know how much you know or care about Killie, but we are trying to make our club better, lots of excitement about our new chairman (a little less so around our new manager) and that will continue regardless of what is going on with you or your business partners.  Maybe Killie will continue to be shite or maybe we'll continue to be a relatively successful team, from a small town.  We simply can't compete at the same level as Celtic, we will never ever ever ever ever have a fraction of the money they do, ever.  It's really that simple. However days like March the 12th 2012, make it all worth while.

Our entire economy depends on handouts from Westminster. It's not sustainable. The strength of the UK's economy comes from the City's role as a global financial hub; that's not generalisable to the rest of the nation, and this is a problem for northern England as much as for Scotland, Wales and NI.

Ireland's seen the excesses of both boom and bust. In the global marketplace, Ireland may not be rivalling the south east of England, but it is doing much better than NI. As an Anglophone Eurozone country, it's been able to attract investment in global industries like pharmaceuticals and technology, and the effects haven't been limited to the M25.

There's also the democratic argument. Though a lot of the important issues are devolved, NI has little say in UK politics.

Everything about him seemed fake and he could do nothing but repeat the same catchphrases over and over again, desperately trying to get any opportunity to start a shit-flinging match between him and Cameron.

Cameron was just reminding us about how terrible Labour is while spitting out figures that are skewed in his favour, like how zero hour contracts bump up his employment figures, bollocks to that. Lib Dems did little else than show off their newly-found Tory collar and leash.

UKIP once again proved that they are little more than a one trick pony with Farage completely unable to enter any debate topic without bringing up immigration and our EU membership. Along with their plans to cut funding for Wales and Scotland they are increasingly showing their true colours as an English nationalist party.

Greens actually managed to come across as more sane than they've portrayed themselves in the past, although some of their policies do tell a different story and I really disagree with their idea to scrap Right to Buy.

Sturgeon smashed it; she fought Scotland's corner incredibly well, she had all the right facts to hand and was confident and assertive throughout. Only so much I can say about the SNP while not being Scottish.

Plaid had a very difficult job ahead of them from the start, talking about Welsh issues to a mostly English audience, but Leanne kept to the task at hand and did a good job of standing up for Wales. I was really pissed off at how Miliband ignored her when she confronted him about issues in Wales, all he had was ""muh mansion tax"" and didn't even bother to address any issues specific to Wales.

After all that, I can imagine my vote probably going to Plaid Cymru. I don't agree with every single one of their policies (although their plans to improve public transport really appeal to me) however, I think it's long overdue that the people of Wales have someone in power who is genuinely going to represent our interests and not London's.

Lithium battery tech has come a long way and it is already cheaper NOW than the projections said it would be in 2020. The increased use just pushes the price down further.

Moreover, the lithium *is* in theory 100% recyclable after the end of the batterys life, however at the moment its simply cheaper to get new lithium and not recycle it by a margin or 2-3x if I remember correctly. With the increased use though, that will flip eventually and we'll be looking at it being majorly recycled if lithium battery trends continue as they have.

Of course I'm sure it's still not an end-all and as you say there isn't really a single solution to electricity generation and storage, but the solutions are getting more varied and cheaper by the year.

The parties themselves are effectively coalitions of people whose views overlap to some degree. At the extremes the Conservatives have both John Bercow and Philip Davies. One to the left of Labour, the other to the right of UKIP.

A coalition of the SNP and Labour could legitimately be described as a coalition of the Left, which might legitimately have more votes than the Conservatives. Now, I'm entirely amenable to the idea that a coalition of the Right could be formed from the Conservatives and UKIP, but after spending the last couple of years talking up UKIP as racist bigots, I doubt the Conservatives would be keen.

&gt; I wonder how it'll go down with the media / public if the largest party by votes can't find enough support to be the party of government.

The media will peddle any pile of bollocks they can sensationalise. They'll run it as if it matters any time they can't find either a, ""Look how huge Kim Kardashian's arse is!"" or, ""Politician X is a kiddie fiddler (according to person Y who told person Z thirty years ago)!"" story.

[100 Players Who Shook The Kop 2013](http://liverpoolfc.wikia.com/wiki/100_Players_Who_Shook_The_Kop_%282013%29)

This is part of a series that was first proposed by /u/CaptainDSid in this thread http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2wrgsm/suggestion_indepth_profiles_on_the_100_players/. They're a series of original articles written by Redditors explaining why some of the Kop's most revered players are so important. Hopefully it'll give newer fans a glimpse of the history of Liverpool FC. 

If you want to write one of these yourself, check to see if it's been assigned on the original thread, if it hasn't write away. If a player you want to write about has already been claimed, but not posted maybe you could contact the user listed in the original thread and offer to write it. 

Try to post on /r/Liverpoolfc on quieter days. Match days can get are pretty busy and it'd be a shame to see a nice piece of writing getting swamped. 

Finally, it'd be good if you were able to copy and past this text onto your own article to explain what's going on, and how to get involved.

Plus I would argue thaf there is a massive difference between the two in any case. The primary contribution of KSA to the world is oil, and decisions regarding purchases of crude are made by the petrol companies and at the highest levels of government. The consumer really has little say in these purchasing decisions and given that oil is a natural resource, the petrol companies, should they wish to keep supplies coming in, can only buy from places where the geology and chemistry have allowed oil deposits to form. 

  Israel however has an ecomony which does produce consumer goods, including fruit,  vegetables and electrical goods. These can be found in most shops and supermarkets, and given consumer choice and the fact that things like fruit/veg sources are not unique to Israel, the decision of any large group of people to choose non-Israeli over Israeli goods will have a better chance of an impact.

However, the key point for a minority gov't is that even if they come to arrangements with other parties for support, the government still consists of just one party, so every Cabinet minister would belong to that party and the other parties would be free to vote against them if they wanted to.

A coalition means that more than one party forms the government, that's the current situation we have where Cabinet posts are shared between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems. Because they're both in government, both parties in a coalition would have to agree to a set of policies at the start of parliament and vote together on all matters for as long as the coalition is maintained. This means that the government should be more stable - less likely to lose votes - but that the smaller party in the coalition would have less room to maneuver and vote against government policies it doesn't like than if they were just propping up a minority government.

No party is talking about house building on the scale needed to make a difference so I don't see it being different if Labour or Tories are in charge. 

An EU referendum that led to a UK exit from the EU would bring down net migration and so ease the stress on the property market but I'm sceptical that we'll get one as the Tories will drop that pledge in a coalition and I'm not convinced it'd even win in a referendum.  

The big change that will affect most people is when interest rates start to creep up, how high will they go and how soon? A long fixed rate is good security against uncertainty in that regard. 

Governments always tinker with pensions but I'm not aware of any big differences between the two on that subject.

2. More cynical: it's a way of saying ""they're not like us"" and dredging up old memories of the huge differences (images of sad people queuing for too little bread from the state).

It's also a way of saying you won't help the poor without blaming them, you're blaming the old political system for messing the countries up.

Finally, all debaters try and frame things as a ""yes or no"" question. Everything can only have two sides, nothing else is allowed. If you can replace the question of ""should we help those less fortunate than ourselves"" (one of the debaters opinions) with ""will you pump money into former communist countries, to pay for the communist regimes mistakes?"" then you leave people thinking ""ooh, they want to prop up old communist mistakes!"".

You'll see the two-side thing all the time. This then leads to each side pushing further and further into corners or trying to be the most ""outraged"".

For example, say you want to lower prison sentences because you have a body of research suggesting they aren't much more effective when longer and with the money saved you could fund X treatments in the NHS saving a bunch of lives. That all sounds pretty reasonable, but if your opponent can frame the debate as ""Do you want to be nice to criminals?"" or ""You want to let child molesters out early to save money?"" then you can get stuck defending paedophiles and that'll be the image everyone sees.

let me ask you, what does lallana have to do to earn 25m? that's a very subjective comment. and surely we did? he wasn't injured all THAT often with saints. 

wrong, we bought markovich based on his potential. its the same thing that happens in us sports when these guys get drafted number 1 and get paid a guarantee contract of 40-50m...we bought off potential and if he starts coming good (and he's only 21), he could be another 50-60m player in near future. he is an incredible talent and im sorry that you do not see that even in the slightest.

Council tax is a regressive tax. The SNP struck a deal with councils to compensate them the shortfall through income tax.

&gt;Restrictions on alcohol purchasing

Minimum pricing laws designed to rid supermarket shelves of 50p gut rot. Some communities in Scotland have a serious problem with alcohol. This is social engineering, of course, but only in the same sense as alcohol and tobacco taxation already is. It just attempts to target the primary enabler of alcoholism. Its not about temperance.

&gt;A ""Football Act"" which, regardless of intent, is pretty much an attack on free speech

Slightly more controversial, but again, intended to tackle a specific Scottish malady of sectarian abuse at football games. I'm agnostic on this one honestly. Provided it is an exceptional, short term targeted policy, I'm broadly in agreement, but it still makes me uncomfortable.

&gt;Wide sweeping centralisation of power

This has been greatly exaggerated by Labour, but it does exist to a degree, and is my least favourite aspect of the SNP. In particular police Scotland, which is a complete misstep IMO. I fundamentally disagree that the police should develop policy at a nationwide level. Especially in a country which has radically different social issues across its breadth. No policy designed to tackle Glasgow's social ills will be relevant in Inverness, let alone Orkney. So yes I agree. This is why I intend to vote Green at Holyrood. On the other side of the balance sheet, the SNP did strike a very decentralist deal regarding the western isles and the northern isles, ceding them lots of local powers and controls, so its not a entirely straightforward issue.

&gt; With some exceptions (as some members voted in favour), a rejection of the ""End of Life Assistance Bill""

Again I was disappointed with Sturgeons lack of support for the bill. I agree.

&gt;No desire for any nationalisation within the party. Criticised for alluding to rail nationalisation (to win votes no doubt) then continuing the franchise

You've already edited to correct this. I don't disagree completely though. Under Salmond, the leadership was definitely not rushing towards nationalisation, but Sturgeon is noticeably to the left of Salmond, who had a tendency to favour a corporate solution and a light touch.

A little correction to your historical account also..

They were called tartan Tories prior to the left wing coup of the party in 79. The 79 group which included Salmond, took the reigns of the party and drove them left. They aren't called the tartan Tories because they colluded with the Tories - your account of this event is just the labour spin I'm afraid. 

The SNP voted aye in the vote of no confidence, because 34 labour MPs had added an amendment to the 79 devolution referendum, requiring 40% of the electorate to vote yes in order to win (effectively a supermajority, considering voted turnout in the 70's). The yes side won the referendum, but didn't reach the 40% mark. The SNP held labour responsible for their amendment. Even Jim Callaghan himself blamed those 34 labour MPs for the 79 vote of no confidence, in his memoirs.

This wasn't the SNP cheerleading the Tories (who did not yet, let's remember carry the baggage of Thatcher's societal vandalism). It was the SNP punishing labour for what they saw as their disregard for Scottish democracy. You don't have to agree with them. But the alternative reading is not that they are tartan Tories, cheering Thatcher on.

* It makes one-party majority governments very unlikely. I think this is a good idea overall, but it's worth noting some drawbacks, such as less government stability which could promote lack of confidence from voters and markets.

* As a consequence of the above, coalitions would effectively become a necessity. This means that government policy would be based on what parties negotiate between themselves rather than on their manifesto promises. There would be an extra step removing leaders from accountability to voters. (An example - at the last German election the centre-right CDU/CSU soundly defeated their main rivals, the centre-left SPD, almost winning a majority, but because of the distribution of seats they were nevertheless forced into a coalition with the SPD and had to give away concessions such as a minimum wage which they were opposed to).

* Following on again, smaller parties who can act as kingmakers can have disproportionately large influence on governments because they can dictate terms knowing that their support is crucial for the government's survival (just as parties like the SNP and UKIP would seemingly like to do, but all the time).

* MPs are less accountable to their constituencies, more accountable to their parties. How it typically works is candidates are placed on 'lists' for each electoral district, and the more votes a party gets the more candidates from that party list are elected. Parties decide who is on that list and in what order, giving voters less of a say regarding who actually represents them.

* It's easier for fringe and extremist parties to gain seats and influence, which can serve to destabilise countries (Ur-example: early 1930s Germany).

* As a solution to the above, most PR systems have a threshold. Rather than being purely proportional parties have to reach a certain percentage of the vote, usually about 3-5%, before they are allocated any seats. This can conversely be unfair on smaller parties, especially regional parties if there's not a compensating mechanism. It can also distort results; again looking at the last German election, the CDU/CSU came just a handful of seats short of a majority despite winning just 41.5% of the vote, this is because 15.8% of the vote went to parties who failed to reach the threshold and so those votes were wasted and did not count towards the distribution of seats.

Just a handful of criticisms off the top of my head. Like I say, I'm broadly in favour of PR, but it's far from perfect. My favoured solution is a mixed system like [MMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation) which elects some members by FPTP or AV but balances these results out by making up the disproportionality with party list members.

The Closure of AGEAS; they are moving all of the [jobs to Stoke](www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-31753369), these were sizable, workable and profitable companies in both the private and public sector; yet they up sticks and moved across the water. The tendency for economies is not to cater for the extremities in times of crisis, but to cater for the centre. Being part of this sphere of influence is having a negative impact on the NI economy. Resources are being continually drawn back to the hub of this operation; which is the city of london and its immediate subsiduaries. NI simply cannot compete on that level, in fact it would be much better if it was part of an All Ireland economic model outside of the Influence of the UK.

Northern Ireland is an [Economic Basket Case](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/northern-ireland-is-the-lame-duck-of-the-uk-29669915.html) and has been for some time. Being Part of the UK has had a [deeply negative](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/over-a-quarter-of-northern-ireland-workers-paid-less-than-the-living-wage-29730081.html) impact on the economy on this part of the island. Borders in general have negative economic impacts, but it has been disastrous for this island.

&gt; A product of the balance of coercion between Britain and nationalist Ireland in 1920,
&gt; the partition of Ireland installed an erratic and meandering international boundary of
&gt; 450km, cross-cutting 1400 agricultural holdings and 180 roads, and bisecting villages and even some individual houses ...  (O’Dowd et al., 1995: 274). 
 
&gt; From a more economic perspective, the Irish border shares many of the characteristics which Mitko et al. (2003) suggests are typical of other border or frontier regions, and which may be contributing to their underdevelopment. For example,Mitko et al. (2003: 21) cite low population densities in border areas in Southeastern Europe which, it has been argued, may lead to a lack of agglomeration economies and a reduction in the scope for local cooperation
&gt;  and learning (Petrakos and Tsiapa, 2001). ^[Source](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforInternationalBordersResearch/Publications/WorkingPapers/MappingFrontiersworkingpapers/Filetoupload,175403,en.pdf)

If you need a stark image to realise the negative impact on Infrastructure and it's subsequent effects on both sides of the border take a look at this [image](http://www.discoveringireland.com/images/stories/Ireland/train_routes.jpg) this covers the railway network, but could be taken as an indicator as to the serious underdevelopment of all areas of the economy, never mind the doubling up and replication of services due to having two separate states on this tiny Island. Partition quite simply is bad for the Economy.

The untold story of the peace process, is that cross border co-operation has been its greatest success story, every effort has been to minimise the effect of the border.The republic of Ireland is Northern Ireland's primary external trading partner and its leading export market.

&gt; There is now general agreement that inter-firm cooperation through networks, partnerships and supply-chains can, by facilitating knowledge exchange and reducing

Case-studies of areas with high levels of such inter-organisational cooperation have generally also been characterised by social and economic uniformity, geographical contiguity, high levels of social capital (including, in particular, trust), and stable and supportive governance and support institutions (Braczyk et al., 1998). **Border regions are often characterised by exactly the opposite conditions: economic discontinuity, low levels of social capital, and governance which is at best divided, and at worst, antagonistic (Mitko et al., 2003). The result can be both a lack of knowledge sharing, diffusion and organisational learning (Petrakos and Tsiapa, 2001), and disproportionately
&gt; low levels of trade. In this context, cross-border cooperation can play an important role, countering the structural discontinuity of border regions and generating a potentially positive growth dynamic**. ^[Source](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforInternationalBordersResearch/Publications/WorkingPapers/MappingFrontiersworkingpapers/Filetoupload,175403,en.pdf)

There is a trend in this Sub to spout overly simplified economic arguments ""such as NI needs 11Bn to be supported, the South doesn't have it"" it is indicative of a complete lack understanding of economics. First of all,  no one asks what led to the situation where we have to be spoon fed, why are we so reliant on subsidies, why is the economy stagnant? It has little to do with the troubles because Northern Ireland has not been a Net Contributor to the UK since the 1930's.

&gt; The weakness of the Northern Ireland economy became apparent in the 1930s, with its reliance on traditional industries which went into decline during the decade. Economic decline, halted only by the Second World War, put strain on Northern Ireland's social structure. ^[Source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/sectarian/brewer.htm)
&gt; 

The reality is that Northern Ireland was only really Economically Viable for about 8 or 9 years of its existence with mild reprieve during WW2, Creating an artificial state on this island was a dreadful mistake economically. The only saving grace was the [Welfare State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c86Gwsb5LY). 
If you have not been paying attention it is under attack. At the moment a free trade Agreement is being Negotiated; EU/US Free Trade Agreement (or TTIP). It will have a devastating impact on public services. The minimal advantages of being Part of the UK, such as the NHS, [won't exist](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/privatisation-agenda-drives-tory-policy-on-nhs-says-andy-burnham-9052640.html) in the near future. 

&gt; The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership The European Commission (EC) is currently involved in negotiating an FTA of unprecedented scale between the US and European Union (EU). This is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (or TTIP). The initial aim was to conclude negotiations at great speed (or ‘on one tank of gas’) by November 2014. It now seems that towards the end of 2015 is more realistic.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to reducing tariffs and increasing protection for transnational investors, TTIP also aims to remove (or ‘harmonise’) regulatory barriers that restrict profitable trade between the US and EU.  These ‘barriers’ are often our most prized and hard-won regulations and standards that protect, for example, our labour rights, environment, food safety, digital privacy, and banking standards.^[Source](http://www.patients4nhs.org.uk/eu-us-free-trade-agreement-or-ttip/)

The advantages of being in the UK are being swept away, the Economic arguments for the state of Northern Ireland are paper thin (and on the verge of being torn to shreds). There are real economic advantages to an All Ireland state that have yet to be tapped. The trend of business is already seeking greater co-operation north and south, it is time for the institutions to follow suit. 

In terms of a United Ireland, real searching questions have to be asked, Has the Northern Ireland experiment worked? What would be good for the Economy?

I'm not extremely worried about our defence like I was previously, Skrtel out is obviously a big blow but we're not going to be waiting forever for Lovren to become good so he needs to step up and play well. I hope in our attacking sense that we bring in Sterling for Lallana's position because his beyond the last man runs really help Sturridge out and as we've seen, we're losing a little bit of focus up front. 2 creative midfielders come at a price to a lot less movement and that would be fine if we had a maniac like Suarez running all game but it's not Sturridge's game.

The only reason this would make it harder for Labour to win, is that Labour are currently (weakly) benefited by the existing boundaries being out of date - typically Labour win urban seats and Tories win rural ones, and there has been a small shift of population from city centres towards suburbs, meaning that Labour seats are on average slightly smaller (and so it takes less Labour votes to elect an MP).  New boundaries would still have been drawn up by the independent boundary commissions, so no danger of US-style gerrymandering.

Decent overview at http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/2015guide/electoral-bias/

The Lib Dems originally agreed to play ball (it was AV Referendum alongside reduced number of MPs on new boundaries):

&gt; We will bring forward a Referendum Bill on
electoral reform, which includes provision for
the introduction of the Alternative Vote in the
event of a positive result in the referendum,
as well as for the creation of fewer and more
equal sized constituencies. We will whip
both Parliamentary parties in both Houses
to support a simple majority referendum on
the Alternative Vote, without prejudice to
the positions parties will take during such a
referendum. 

However after the Tories put the boot in during the AV Referendum they decided to take their ball and go home unless they got Lords Reform too.  Tories didn't agree with that, so the ball went home and we're still using the old boundaries that were determined in [2007](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Periodic_Review_of_Westminster_constituencies) at best.

In more depth, [this article](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/37245/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-The_proposed_constituency_boundary_changes_will_hurt_the_Liberal_Democrats_and_not_help_the_Tories_mu.pdf) suggests the net effect would be the Tories losing 15 seats, Labour losing 18, the Lib Dems losing 14, and others losing 3; this perhaps suggests a cynical reason for the Lib Dems changing their minds and opposing the change too!",null,0,null,1428071731,null,0,false,0,cpzyuxb,null,t3_31av7a,null,t1_cpzyuxb,null,t1_cpzxnf7,null,null,null,1432173281,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

&gt;

&gt;The __West Region__ is a [NUTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature_of_Territorial_Units_for_Statistics) Level III [region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland) of [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland). It consists of the area under the jurisdiction of the [county councils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_council#Republic_of_Ireland) of counties [Galway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Galway), [Mayo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Mayo) and [Roscommon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Roscommon), along with [Galway City Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway_City_Council). The West region spans 13,801 km² (20% of the total area of the state) and has a population of 380,057 (8% of the state's total). The regional capital is [Galway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway) city.  Its NUTS code is IE013.

&gt;The region is located on the western seaboard of Ireland with the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the [River Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Shannon) delimiting the region to the east. The West Region is largely rural, with only 30% of its population living in urban areas. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] It is noted for its continuance of Irish traditions, such as the Irish language in the region's [Gaeltacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaeltacht) areas.

A majority government controls at least half the votes in parliament - so numerically it has a majority over all other parties put together, and as long as its own MPs turn up and don't rebel it can guarantee that votes will go its way.  Example: almost all UK governments in recent history, at least immediately following the General Election.  By the end of the 1992-1997 Parliament, John Major's Conservatives (who won a narrow majority in 1992) had lost sufficient MPs at byelections that they'd transitioned from being a majority government to a minority.

A minority government, on the other hand, controls less than half of the votes, and so is dependent on at least some opposition MPs either abstaining or supporting them.  Example: 2007-2012 SNP administration in Scotland, where they were unable or unwilling to agree terms with any of the other parties to form a coalition, but equally nobody else was prepared to put together a larger coalition either.

In short, a majority government is much more able to push through radical or controversial legislation, while a minority government generally needs to pursue consensus and ""not scare the horses"".

Coalition is where two (or more) parties agree to band together, *normally* to achieve a majority.

But, for example, you could've created a Labour/Lib Dem coalition in 2010.  That would've had 315 seats, 8 more than the Conservative total of 307.  Providing the other parties (DUP's 8, SNP's 6, sundry other minor parties) didn't band together with the Conservatives, they could have taken power as a minority coalition - but would forever need to risk losing legislation unless they could convince other parties to support it, as you (nominally) need 326 MPs for a majority.  I say nominally, since Sinn Fein win seats but don't take them, and the Speaker doesn't vote.",null,0,null,1428072717,null,0,false,0,cpzzdbc,null,t3_31atw3,null,t1_cpzzdbc,null,t3_31atw3,null,null,null,1432173520,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Men and women used to be able to be dear and good friends and express that *philia*, when today they would be called gay--despite the fact that there's no sexual or romantic love involved. 

Ok, so moving on. I felt that Series 8 was Doctor Clara and less Doctor Who. I feel like she became more front and center than companions in the past. I *loved* her as the Impossible Girl with 11, and the mystery and the intrigue over her identity. She was great. But the chemistry that she enjoyed with Matt seemed forced with Peter. Danny and Clara seemed to belong more on Torchwood than Doctor Who. Torchwood's people are people who try to do good  but often can't see beyond their own whims and wants and desires. Clara was willing to destroy the TARDIS, for goodness sake. Rose and Martha and Donna and Amy and Rory gave so much and lost so much, and would never have done what Clara did (even though it was just a dream, she thought it was real). But even beyond those issues, Capaldi is a great actor and I'm not seeing him shine. I'm seeing him get tied up in Coleman's crap.

&gt;When [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) was declared in 1939, it had a negative effect on [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football); competitions were suspended and players signed up to fight, resulting in the deaths of many players.

If Northern Irealnd was to be just another region of the RoI we should compare it to other regions removed from Dublin, such as West region Ireland where the GDP per Capita is 70% the ROI average.

There is an inherent geographic disadvantage Northern Ireland faces by being isolated from Europe with Dublin and London in between. I see no reason Dublin won't have a similar effect to SE England on being the primary magnet for investment at the expnse of other regions. Arguably our current status as a seperate 'country' allows us greater foriegn investment opportunity , than merely being just another region of the RoI.

Also considering we had the 30 years of the RA trying to ruin the Northern Irish economy, we are only slighty worse off than the Border Midlands &amp; West area of the RoI.

Reintegrating Donegal, Derry, Tyrone Sligo and Galway with a massive investment in infrastructure would change this islands Economy immeasurably.

&gt; There is an inherent geographic disadvantage Northern Ireland faces by being isolated from Europe with Dublin and London in between. I see no reason Dublin won't have a similar effect to SE England on being the primary magnet for investment at the expnse of other regions. Arguably our current status as a seperate 'country' allows us greater foriegn investment opportunity , than merely being just another region of the RoI.

Except it doesn't, any real outside investment is going to Dublin, investment in Northern Ireland is dismal and further hampered further by the various Tax free crown dependencies that the UK has to offer.
 
&gt; Also considering we had the 30 years of the RA trying to ruin the Northern Irish economy, we are only slighty worse off than the Border Midlands &amp; West area of the RoI.

NI has not been a Net contributor to the UK since the 1930's it's economy was in trouble long before the troubles started.

null,false,rrea436,,Lisnaskea,null,"economically the short term would be disastrous, unifying or splitting countries causes massive strain on the countries, early 90's Germany was hurt immensely, and that included a Federalized system, going from having a partially devolved state into a Unitary one, is going to hurt. Were not dealing with as large a scale as Germany, but we arguably have even less infrastructure than what is needed.

Long term it would probably be fine, the republic is not exactly a shit-hole, it's had good growth, good GDP, and it's business laws are modernized for a globalized world quite well. Swapping to Euro would help tourism to places like Fermanagh, and Belfast that under the strong pound are actually suffering.

And then we'd have the political shit-storm, that is getting rid of Stormont. Stormont and the Dail have conflicting laws, and mindsets.
  As of November 2013 every party in the Dail supports same sex marriage, compared to a the""conscience clause"", Politics has stopped certain schools integrating, and supports segregated housing.

Those last two are huge problems, Sinn fein is scared of normalizing Northern Ireland and setting the default to partition, but all it does is mean that in the case of a UI we would still have the social problems between communities, there are annual riots, and parades, this doesn't happen in the south. 

 What would happen to the Unionist populations? they would still be segregated, worse than that they would feel attacked, their is a difference between having a voluntary Irish class scheme in east Belfast and forcing their children to learn it in school. What happens to the 12th? good luck shutting that down in Belfast. 

And then we have public spending. The PSNI is kitted out more than some armies, they need to be - remember those annual riots- the Guards don't have the training or resources to deal with NI's problems. Public sector employment is 28% in Northern Ireland that's about 200,000, that the Dail would need to pay (to keep them on) or find new jobs for. 

And finally the 1/6th of a voice argument that people always make. Ireland has 6.4 million people, with the republic having under 4.6 million and the north over 1.8 million. What you end up with in a UI is 1/6 of a country not wanting to be there.

However, if party A wins 49, party B wins 40 and party C wins 11, A+C can together control a majority and win every vote. This is a (majority) **coalition government**. Majority because it controls more than half+1 of seats, and coalition because it is formed of more than one party. (This is what happened in 2010)

If party A wins 49, party B wins 40 and party C wins 11, but no-one can agree enough to form a coalition, party A could form a **minority government**. Parties B+C can gang up on them so party A has to negotiate for support on every single bill. Sometimes party A+B will support a law together, sometimes A+C. Party B+C can also team up to chuck out party A from government. This will likely result in a new election.

Now, if we add more parties into the mix, we might have party A on 44, party B on 41, party C with 5, party D with 5, party E with 3 and party F with 2. This fucks things up for everyone to be honest. party A+B could get together to break the deadlock. This is called a '**grand coalition**'. In our country that would be a coalition between Labour and the Conservatives.

Or, A+C+D could get together. That would be a **majority** (because it controls more seats than the other parties put togther)** coalition** (because two or more parties have negotiated a common government programme).

You could also have A+C get together. That would be a **minority coalition**.

null,false,Woodentop_renegade,null,null,null,"It is a civil dispute, no criminal act has been committed at that point. There is no such offence here of ""breaking and entering"". If they're using a key to enter the door (which belongs to them anyway) then there is no criminal damage offence there. There is no offence of burglary either. At least until they actually steal something or commit assault occasioning grievous bodily harm against any person in the building. 

The two clauses that outline burglary are 9(1)(a) and 9(1)(b) of the theft act. Without wanting to dribble on about it a says that a person is guilty of burglary if they enter any building, or part as a trespasser with the intention to steal, damage things or commit GBH. B says they're guilty of burglary if they have entered as a trespasser and then stole stuff or committed GBH. It makes no mention of unlawful damage. NB the term criminal damage is not used as this act pre-dates the criminal damage act. 9 1 b means that if someone enters as a tresspasser for a look round and nothing more but then nicks things they can still be done for burglary and it just cuts off what would otherwise be a very commonly used statutory defence.  

 Proving A with a landlord entering a premises, more or less impossible and you could argue the finer points about tresspass too really. Although in my opinion the landlord would enter as a trespasser since they have no lawful authority to enter and don't have the occupier's permission to enter. At that stage the tenant would be well within their rights to ask them to leave and to use reasonable force there after to get them to leave. Should the tenant who's not been warned that the landlord is going to enter the premisses should believe that the person who has entered is a burglar and winds up wrapping a frying pan round the landlord's cannister well that's unfortunate. The Landlord doesn't really have any recourse in that situation unless the force used continued after the tenant realised who it was or would have been excessive had he have been a burglar.

And we already have an historical precedent, The Northern Irish State was brought into existence with the threat of looming violence from unionists as they had done previously over home rule, it confirmed the worst of possible fears for northern nationalists. 

&gt; The Unionist government ignored Edward Carson's warning in 1921 that alienating Catholics would make Northern Ireland inherently unstable. After the early 1920s, there were occasional incidents of sectarian unrest in Northern Ireland. These included the brief Northern campaign in the 1940s, and Border campaign between 1956 and 1962, which did not enjoy broad popular support among nationalists. In 1962, the IRA called off its campaign for the same lack of popular local support. Northern Ireland was relatively stable.^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles#1922.E2.80.931966)

Rather than heed these warnings the Unionist Government, set about creating a one party state with it's inherent discrimination in all aspects of daily life. rigging elections,denying housing, jobs and a fair opportunity on the basis of religion; ""a protestant state for a protestant people"". Yet the nationalist population did not rise up, it had the opportunity in the 1950's with the IRA border campaign, yet it failed to garner support.

Violence, as we know it is not and never has been fueled simply by national or ethnic identity; Violence is however inextricably linked to material conditions and quality of life, a pattern emerges from periodic violence it is always linked to the economy and the active participation in it.
 
&gt; After the Partition of Ireland in 1920, sporadic violence continued between the two communities. The violence was cyclic in nature and **often coincided with downturns in the local economy** (e.g., riots during the depression of the 1930s). Conversely, when the economy picked up, as it did in the post-war years, ethnic violence subsided; for example, during a peak of the economy in the 1950s, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was unable to launch a successful bid for secession due to apathy in the Catholic community (Darby 1976, 13). The pattern of separate settlements, school districts, and employment, however, continued as before ^[source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/landon.htm)

It took the Northern state 48 years to erupt in violence from it's inception. It was a one party gerrymandered state that habitually discriminated against it's minority. Even then there was no appetite among northern Nationalists for the IRA border campaign, which was abandoned in failure. A lesson could be learned there that national identity alone was not a catalyst for violence even when faced with such discrimination. The key change in all of this was demands for improvement in material conditions within the NI state, not a United Ireland, i.e Civil Rights. It is important to remember that these demands where not calling for a United Ireland but an end to discrimination in electoral representation, policing, employment and housing. It was the fact that the state reacted so violently to these reasonable demands that led to mass violence. 

None of these conditions will be met in the event of a United Ireland, firstly it will be a democratic process; namely not against the will of the people. There will be no intention to discriminate against the protestant population or deny them rights.In fact they would be more likely to be embraced and culture respected.

If there are protests no doubt they will be boisterous, possibly unwieldy they will however be carried out by a smaller number than you imagine; in reality the last big hurrah of [Unionist Mass protest](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/rally1.jpg) was in 1985, after the signing of the [Anglo Irish Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Agreement). Since then there has been a steady increase in cooperation between the British and Irish Governments, with even further participation and cooperation of the Irish Government in NI affairs. 

As for the Irish Army they have garnered an International reputation dealing in war torn regions and specialise in peace keeping missions, they would be more than capable in dealing with any resurgent paramilitary forces. Loyalist paramilitaries would never again receive the weapons, intelligence and Logistical support it enjoyed from the British Security Forces over the period of the [troubles](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2955941.stm). Most likely the British Army and security services would follow international protocol and accept the democratic wishes of the people and provided logistical support against Loyalist insurgents. Much like the Logistical support provide to Pro-Treaty Forces in the south in 1921.
 
&gt; By contrast, the Free State government managed to expand its forces dramatically after the start of the war. Michael Collins and his commanders were able to build up an army that was able to overwhelm their opponents in the field. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, armoured cars, machine guns, small arms, and ammunition were much help to pro-treaty forces. The National Army amounted to 14,000 men by August 1922, was 38,000 strong by the end of 1922, and by the end of the war had grown to 55,000 men and 3,500 officers, far in excess of what the Irish state would need to maintain in peacetime.^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Civil_War)",null,0,null,1428077349,null,0,1428080340,1,cq020bg,null,t3_31ako0,null,t1_cq020bg,null,t1_cpzxyet,null,null,null,1432174762,null,9,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,9,null

&gt;The __Global Commission on Drug Policy__ (GCDP) is a panel of 22 world leaders and intellectuals which issued an assessment in 2011 of the global [War on Drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs), opening its report with ""The global war on drugs has failed, with devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world.""  The emphasis in [drug policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy) on harsh law enforcement over four decades has not accomplished its goal of banishing drugs and has in fact spawned wide, dramatic eruptions of violence, the report continued. By way of alternative, the GCDP report ""advocates [decriminalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_liberalization) drug use by those who do no harm to others.""

That's a ridiculously short-sighted statement. The current state of politics looks unlikely to produce a majority but it doesn't mean it's going to stay that way. All it would take is for Labour or the Tories to boost their polling to the high 30s or low 40s, which is far from impossible, and they would almost certainly win a majority.

&gt;Give the people what they want and switch to PR. You use Germany in your example, we could do a hell of a lot worse than by run like them.

I agree. I think the German constitution is, in most respects, brilliant. But it nevertheless has flaws that are worth thinking about.

&gt;Also, save for an election every 5 years, we have absolutely no accountability over our MPs.

The point is that, if enough voters are unhappy with their MP they can vote them out at election time.

No. He believed in Klopp and has now been developed into an awesome attacker. We played some of the most exciting attacking football I've seen in years last season. If Sterling looks at the departures of Suarez and Gerrard and wants out because of that then he hasn't got the mentality to succeed. But it's not that. Sterling's talking about success as if he's an established and consistent attacker scoring goals and being let down by his team mates when in reality it is not like that at all. He's speaking about wanting trophies and leagues but ignores the fact that if he improves, there is a greater chance of winning trophies. That tells me that this has been set up (most likely by his agent) to get more money. That's it.

I believe that Rodgers is a better coach than Pellegrini and Wenger. Pellegrini has badly failed this season and Wenger didn't win anything for a long long time. When Rodgers wins his first trophy, lots more will follow after, I am sure. He needs to first learn how to jump the first hurdle and understand what gives success and what doesn't to jump the rest of the other hurdles. Which is why the FA Cup is so important.

**Guardian beliefs**

* Everything was better when Brown was in power.

* It's okay for a Muslim to spray-paint ""Islam will rule the world"" on a monument to fallen heroes and get off scot-free but utterly unacceptable for friendly Christians to bring cakes to sick relatives in hospital.

* Cuba under Fidel Castro wasn't nearly as oppressive as England under Thatcher after you put aside little issues like torture because let's face it, there was less class discrimination.

* If a home-owner shoots a burglar he deserves to be imprisoned for life whilst convicted child-molesters deserve nothing more than a brief stay in a luxurious rehabilitation centre complete with X-Boxes and plasma screen televisions.

* People who walk into public places and blow themselves up, killing tens of innocent pedestrians, such as women and children, are simply misunderstood human beings and anyone who calls them ""evil"" or ""terrorists"" and says that they should be shot is a tiny-minded, racist, bigoted Neo-Nazi.

* Homosexual men kissing in public is benevolent and praiseworthy but lesbians doing so is lewd and inappropriate because lesbians appeal to heterosexual men who are after all the scum of the Earth.

* Gay marriage is completely acceptable and normal in a modern society but straight men going out with, or even fancying younger women is disgusting, degrading and misogynistic.

* If you like trains to arrive on time, or anything to be on time for that matter, you're a fascist!

* If you are Christian you are a moron. If you are a Muslim or almost any other faith (providing it is a non-white religion of course), you should be allowed to do so freely without any criticism. All churches should get knocked down and replaced with Mosques.

* A Guardian vision of Utopia for Britain would be a country made up entirely of gays, lesbians, non-white people, Muslims, and cyclists. No white straight men who even remotely believe in God would be allowed to stay unless they regularly advocate gay rights and feminism, promote immigration and multiculturalism, pretend to be fiercely atheist,and cycle to work.

Man-made [tidal lagoons](http://www.middlemarchcomms.co.uk/plans-for-worlds-first-series-of-tidal-lagoons-unveiled-in-uk) can produce energy for up to 14 hours every day.

&gt;Second, tides are not at the same time every day. We know when they happen, but peak tidal power generation will not always match up with peak power usage in the areas.

This is where we diversify between wind, solar, nuclear, fossil, and work on battery storage technology.

&gt;Thirdly, tidal power is still not as consistent as fossil or nuclear power. You have 2 high tides and 2 low tides each day, and neither will be as high or as low as each other. There are also Spring and Neap tides, where the high and low tides are at their maximum each month. All of this effects the hours and power generation that tidal can provide.

Just read about tidal lagoons, seriously.

null,false,strifeblood,null,null,null,"Because he can be a valuable asset right now in the title race. Look at good to great players who have left the club and achieved success near instantly. It's not a coincidence that getting a string of games helps a player return to form. It's why players like Salah, Sturridge and Schurrle have had success at their new clubs. Sure, they were out of form their first 1 to 3 games, but after then they've really improved their team by making it much harder for the opposition. 

This title race will likely come down to 3 big games: United at home, Arsenal away and Liverpool at home. In those games, having an in form Cuadrado would give us a better chance than Willian. I love Willian's effort and work rate, but he's just lacking in the final third whether it's his finishing, final balls or crossing. Cuadrado has shown just this football year in the World Cup, international breaks and with Fiorentina that he's better than Willian in terms of scoring and creating for his team. Not saying Willian is a bad player because he definitely has his moments of brilliance, but Cuadrado would offer so much more consistency-wise, especially in those big games where we don't have as many chances as say a game against Leicester or Palace. 

How can you be certain if he needs a preseason to contribute at his level when we've never seen him play a string of fixtures to get adjusted? We've seen just this year how Salah and Schurrle just needed like two games together to become effective for their new teams. What if he's a quick learner? If he's still mediocre, then we can go to Willian for the remainder of the season like you suggested. 

Plus, it's not like we're in a position where can't take any risks or we're going to lose the title. We're 6 points ahead of City with a game in hand. We also play Stoke and QPR next, which realistically are the easiest (relative terms, I'm not underestimating these clubs for sure) set of consecutive fixtures until Leicester and Palace. This is the perfect time to get Cuadrado a chance as we *should* be getting past these teams regardless of who plays at right attacking mid/winger. 

We've also seen so many times in the history of the sport, whether it's in a single game or over the course of a season, that often times the team who's ahead but doesn't dare to take risks ends up losing in the end because they're too scared.

Not to get too involved in this larger discussion, but do you really believe this to be true a day after a Nationwide, cross-party debate that completely excluded Northern Ireland from it? 

The DUP is the fourth largest party in Westminster at the moment, and even without the rest of the 18 Northern Irish seats will easily outnumber UKIP, Green and Plaid Cymru combined, yet Northern Ireland is excluded from the rest of the General election because the Tories and Labour do not field candidates/win seats here. 

Our votes don't impact who is in Government, whilst the Welsh and Scottish both hold sway, largely over Labour support in those countries (the loss of it this year in Scotland is almost certainly going to lead to another hung parliament and a powerful amount of seats for the SNP). 

We have 5 MPs who refuse to even be involved in Parliament at any level and the rest of our MPs have some of the [highest rates of non-attendance in Westminster](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/sep/08/mp-attendance-lords). 

Our 'voice' in Parliament is usually only heard when a Donaldson or a Paisley is standing, talking to an empty room and complaining about how the Republican parties make their life difficult in the Assembly. 

The rest of the UK does its best to ignore Northern Ireland politically and we let them by being too involved with the same old sectarian crap arising from a conflict that's now been essentially over for as long as those just now of voting age have even been alive.

We don't *need* to leave the UK to fix NI - we need to finally move on from the us-vs-them politics and focus on growing the country economically and culturally beyond it - but we shouldn't pretend that being IN the UK gives us any voice in its Governance.

The irony is Scots voted no in the referendum for primarily economic reasons... and those issues haven't been in any way addressed by the SNP.

Goals:

 * reduce road congestion, maintenance &amp; accidents
 * improve life for families with working parents
 * slightly reduce demand for housing in greater London
 * increase demand in local rural economies

Downsides:

 * requires workers to live somewhere with stable &amp; fast internet connections
 * favours some industries over others due to feasibility
 * reduced income from travel taxes (fuel &amp; rail tickets)
 * favours younger workers who are more familiar with computers

Implementation approach:

 * grants &amp; technical assistance to help businesses set things up
 * zero employer's NIC for all employee-days at home (so work 50% of your time at home &amp; employer pays 50% ENIC)

Effect on UK PLC finances:

 * initial hit to finances from grants
 * ongoing reduced NIC income
 * CO2 compliance (Kyoto) will be easier with less road travel &amp; congestion
 * reduced operating costs (office &amp; tax) make British businesses more competitive

The only real winner last night was Sturgeon but they're already going to take pretty much all of Labours seats in Scotland anyway.

Roberto played it safe, bet on our talent and against the relative shit that was below us, and it payed off.

&gt;

&gt;A __war crime__ is a serious violation of the [laws and customs of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_and_customs_of_war) (also known as [international humanitarian law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law)) giving rise to individual criminal responsibility. Examples of war crimes include: 

&gt;


&gt;* [murdering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murdering), mistreating, or [deporting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation) [civilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian) [residents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(domicile\)) of an [occupied territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_territory) to [slave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave) [labor camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_camp)

&gt;* murdering or mistreating [prisoners of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_war) or [civilian internees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Internee)

&gt;* forcing protected persons to serve in the forces of a hostile power

&gt;* killing [hostages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage)

&gt;* killing or punishing [spies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage) or other persons convicted of war crimes without a [fair trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial)

&gt;* wantonly destroying [cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities), [towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town), [villages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villages), or other objects not warranted by [military necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_necessity)

&gt;
Similar concepts, such as [perfidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidy), have existed for many centuries as customs between countries, but these customs were first codified as [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law) in the [Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hague_Conventions_(1899_and_1907\)). [The modern definition of a war crime was further developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_principles) under the auspices of the [Nuremberg Trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials), based on the definition in the [London Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Charter_of_the_International_Military_Tribunal) that was published on August 8, 1945. Along with war crimes, the charter also defined [crimes against peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_peace) and [crimes against humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_against_humanity), which are often committed during [wartime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War) and in concert with war crimes.

&gt;Article 22 of The Hague IV (""Laws of War: Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV); October 18, 1907"") states that: ""The right of [belligerents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belligerent) to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.""  Over the last century, [many other treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_treaties_on_the_laws_of_war) have introduced positive laws that place constraints on belligerents. Some of the provisions, such as those in the The Hague and the [Geneva Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions) and the [Genocide Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention), are considered to be part of [customary international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_international_law), and are binding on all.   Others are only binding on individuals if the belligerent power to which they belong is a party to the treaty which introduced the constraint.

I'm not saying *every* Scottish person with the intentions of voting Labour is thinking that, but there will be plenty of people who sit on the fence between Labour and SNP but would much rather be under Labour than the Tories so they vote Labour for the 'safety' aspect, rather than gamble by voting SNP. Obviously the best situation for Labour is to win their own seats in Scotland, rather than end up in a Labour-SNP coalition - regardless of how likely it is - so they're never gonna just say ""yeah go on then, vote for the other guys"" are they? 

At the end of the day, some supporters of the SNP (and especially those that are unsure) would rather see a '50% Labour - 40% Tory - 10% UKIP' government where the party most conforming to their ideals (outside of the SNP) has a majority, than see a '30% Labour - 20% SNP - 40% Tory - 10% UKIP' government where there is much larger chance of the majority being completely opposed to their ideals. Labour are just playing into their own hand by denying the chance of a coalition,  because it enforces the former of these options. By saying the only way to get a Labour government is to vote Labour (despite this maybe not being their actual intentions) they are just trying to maximise on the amount of votes they get, and the subsequent amount of power. Whether you like or agree with tactical voting is irrelevant,  because it happens in just about every constituency in the country.

PR for the commons to represent the national mood of the people more accurately.

Basically my point is that tidal lagoons are a great idea for generating electricity in coastal areas. However, my argument is that they are not a complete solution.

About that political and funky bit. I think this was the logical step forward for him. He played around with all of those concepts on GKMC and I was looking forward to how those concepts would carry forward. It was the same with Radiohead. Nobody knew how these artists are going to move forward with their masterpieces (GKMC and Ok Computer) but when the next project came out (Kid A and TPAB), even though it was something from the left field, it just...made sense. 

It's easy to say in hindsight but yeah, it made sense. To me at least. Section.80 was him looking at the world with an immature point of view. GKMC was him processing a more mature series of events, as well as a society, but it was still rough. TPAB was him going all out, looking at society, criticising it. His trip to South Africa changed him too and a lot of influence from that change can be seen here. I was watching an interview the other day and he says that he had to deal with the futility of his project. One in the sense that even though many people talk about him now, digest these concepts he's brought to the table, he'll be seen as another artist with something edgy to say and he'll be forgotten. Another reason for this futility was also that he changed so many lives around the world after the release of his two albums, he still hasn't been able to reach out to his close ones. 

Knowing about his ideas and the back story definitely helped. Maybe it's not just for everyone, but I just wanted to say why I loved it. ",null,0,null,1428082996,null,0,false,0,cq05eju,null,t3_31ahua,null,t1_cq05eju,null,t1_cpzy2so,null,null,null,1432176433,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

One of the Cambridge colleges (Trinity) publishes a [list](http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/acceptable-level-subject-combinations) of which A levels they think are generally suitable, which they think are only alright if you want to go into certain subjects, and which they won't look at at all - this roughly corresponds to respectability, particularly from an academic point of view. TL;DR for the link: Maths, Further Maths, Individual Sciences, Foreign Languages (including Latin/Ancient Greek), History, Geography, Music, and the like are respectable. Law, Government and Politics, Computing, Art and Design, and various other things are ok if that's what you want to keep doing. Anything that ends in ""studies"" that isn't religious studies, or is trying to combine the sciences together, is not.

This doesn't mean that ""softer"" subjects aren't worth doing if you're interested in them, of course, but they are unlikely to help much with going into something that's not directly related to them (particularly before you have other experience or qualifications), and in some cases aren't actually necessary to go into the area (study or work) later.

Even within the ""respected academic"" subjects, some are considered harder than others, and hence mainly more respectable - although it can be hard to judge since everyone finds different things difficult. As for the most common, I'm not really sure overall.

I'm not saying it can't, just that it hampers it, a great deal. Why bother invest in the UK if you are doing it offshore? If the Island of Ireland is an Option the overwhelming majority of FDI is in the south every study indicates this. 

&gt; Forgein investors don't give a shit about partition or infrastructure links to the rest of Ireland, the RoI is an irrelevantly small market. The only infastructure links that matter are the Belfast and Larne harbours.

Sorry; but this is not the case. ROI is the amongst the Largest trading partners of the UK.
 
&gt; In fact, Ireland imports more goods from Britain than the rest of Europe combined, according to the British Irish Chamber of Commerce. This close trading relationship is not surprising considering the trading advantages UK companies have; they share a timezone, have close sea and air links, use the same language and have similar regulatory frameworks. ^[Source](http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/feb/11/exporting-to-ireland-small-business)

And specifically for Northern Ireland

&gt; The republic of Ireland is Northern Ireland’s primary external trading partner and its leading export market.^[Source](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/419739/Northern-Ireland/44647/Finance).

The Idea that potential FDI's do not take into account the Infrastructure of the whole island when doing business here is absurd.

&gt; Much of the south's prosperty comes from US companies setting up tax havens that have create job strongs attached. Hardly homegrown captial creation. If they were to up sticks and move to Poland, the Irish ecnomy would be in dire straights.

This is the nature of all FDI's worldwide it is a risk everywhere, what exactly is your point?

&gt; If you are interested in serving the wider UK market, why would you locate off shore? Stability and transparency etc., is certainly questionable and the potential productivity increases available by locating to say Belfast are unclear. Even Labour costs while cheap by Irish standards, are considerably higher than those of say Poland. Labour costs may be an issue for manufacturing projects, it is the quality of the local workforce that matters for most projects locating on the island of Ireland. Germany’s lost territories of Silesia &amp; Prussia win hands down and have the direct transport links that enables products to be with customers within hours. A quick squint at the website of Wroclaw, the former German city of Breslau shows what you can attract when you tick all the boxes.  (Wroclaw/Breslau’s university can boast 9 Nobel Prize winners, such as Theodor Mommsen, Philipp Lenard, Eduard Buchner, Paul Ehrlich, Fritz Haber, Friedrich Bergius, Erwin Schrödinger, Otto Stern and Max Born, admittedly mainly Germans.)
&gt; 
&gt; Looking at individual cities, Dublin (4,615 jobs) is the third largest recipient of FDI jobs in Europe, beaten only by the Paris Region and Barcelona. The only city comparable to Belfast in the top ten is Freiburg (597 jobs). However it is located in Baden Wurttemberg, with a top class university, 500 years older than Queens, and at the centre of a massive transport infrastructure.
&gt; 
&gt; Dublin is clearly a major hub of investment, attracting a substantial number of FDI projects in the ICT sector. Assuming it is Belfast’s intention to go after such projects, why would a company locate there over Cork, Limerick or Galway, which, despite having existing ICT sectors, struggle to compete against Dublin? Cork has Apple, EMC, Amazon, McAfee and VMware   for example and all three locations provide the same wider benefits as Dublin, other than they do not have the concentration of activity that Dublin has.^[source](http://sluggerotoole.com/2014/12/20/why-would-you-bother-investing-in-northern-ireland/)

The fact of the matter is FDI is a risk but the south of Ireland is doing it much better at it, our current link to the UK is doing us damage.

&gt; Greater Belfast still has quite a strong industrial sector. I still can't find a breakdown of gdp per region but I would bet money on Northern Ireladn overall weak economic picture being due to unde rdevolpment west of the Bann, which has a number of historic causes other than partition. 

Firstly the attempt to pass the west of the Bann of as underperforming economically; as if it where some natural occurence is absurd. It's underdevelopment, is directly linked to the colonisation, plantation and subsequent extraction of resources which fed the industrial revolution in Britain, this is inextricably linked to ensuing partition of this Island.

Interestingly enough if you want a look at Export figures for Industry in Belfast you will find it here on [page 25](http://www.idaireland.com/news-media/featured-news/multinationals-exports/IEA-Top-250-Exporters-July-2011.pdf), the report is by IDA Ireland, the Irish Governmental body dealing with FDI, in the Report you will find and entire section devoted to Northern Ireland, Written by Dr Vicky Kell,
Director of Trade, Invest NI. It's also sponsored by the The Irish Exporters Association an all island body.
 
&gt; The Irish Exporters Association office and Council is located in Dublin, with regional councils in the South, Southwest and Northern Ireland.

I think this shows the business community all ready see the benefits in All-Ireland co-operation when it comes the economy, in fact regardless of the border this tiny island already has a deeply interconnected economy.

And that level of belief gets even further reduced when you look at the more elite of those scientists. 

For instance - see [this page](http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/reason-and-reverence):

&gt;Among elite scientists (those with an asterisk by their names in James McKean Cattell's American Men of Science), the percentage of believers was lower, at 31.6 percent. Among elite biologists, the subset who believed in God was even smaller—16.9 percent. In 1996 and 1998, Edward Larson and Larry Witham replicated Leuba's study, publishing their findings in the April 23, 1997, and July 23, 1998, issues of Nature. Their surveys revealed that of all scientists questioned, 39.3 percent professed belief in a personal God, about the same as in the 1914 study. However, among elite scientists—now defined as members of the National Academy of Sciences—the proportion who were believers had plummeted to 7 percent, with biologists showing the least religious conviction at 5.5 percent. In the general population of the United States, some 86 percent profess belief in the existence of a personal God, according to a 1999 Gallup poll. These figures dramatically indicate the great no-mans land separating the religious convictions of ordinary citizens from those of the scientific community, especially its leading members. This dissensus has fueled many of the bitter battles recently fought over evolution and stem cells and has ignited explosive devices laid along several political byways.

&gt; The relevance of party membership is massively overstated. All it really does is nominally give parties more ""foot-soldiers"" on the ground... however, in this day and age of digital media you have to wonder how useful that really is. 

It's incredibly useful. Don't get me wrong, social media is helpful for talking to your own supporters, and the media. It's important to have a social media campaign, and the SNP have one of the best. See [here](http://www.totalpolitics.com/print/254837/the-snpand39s-social-media-success.thtml), or [here](http://www.thedrum.com/news/2011/04/29/how-snp-using-social-media-win-votes), or [here.](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/snp-praised-for-social-media-use.15566873) And look at last night's tv debate - there's a reason that [twitter says Nicola Sturgeon won](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11512203/Election-debates-Who-does-Twitter-think-is-winning.html). The SNP are fantastic at social media, **and** they have a growing party membership. It's not one or the other with them. But that's besides the point. It's people chapping doors that win elections. No one's mind is ever made up by a snappy put down on twitter. 

&gt; The other trouble is that not all party members are equal. Some are more engaged than others - and in the case of the SNP they tend to have large numbers of subscriber-members that don't actually really engage on a ground level.

There really is no other way of dealing with this than to say that you are fundamentally wrong, and it really shows your lack of knowledge in Scottish politics. The SNP are consistently praised for their ability to get activists out on the doors. I've been involved in the last 3 elections in Scotland, and the SNP have consistently had more activists on the doortstep than any other party. You don't see the SNP paying activists. You don''t see them bussing in activists from other areas. Labour have literally just concluded a campaign where they bussed Labour activists from England in to campaign in Scotland. Earlier this year they advertised for something like 20 local organisers specifically for Scottish seats. 

The SNP didn't do that, you know why? Because they don't have to. They're campaigns are run locally by local activists. I'm sorry but the idea that you are trying to spin the SNP having over 5 times the number of members as the next nearest Scottish party is completely mental. 

&gt;If you look at SNP membership, the numbers are big since the referendum but the level of political experience is poor and the actual engagement (i.e. volunteering, canvasing etc.) is not that great. 

No one joins a political party without being engaged in politics. Besides anything else it costs money. The SNP isn't even one of the cheaper parties to join - it's a minimum of £12 a year - but it's open ended, some give way more, and I think the average for my local branch is around £20 a year. Very few pay that and then just disappear - apart from anything else, most new members of the SNP come from the experience of having campaigned in the referendum. 

All of this ignores the fact that even before the rise in membership, the SNP had more members (by quite a margin) than any other Scottish party.

After the 2 years are up, you will be switched to a higher rate VARIABLE rate at say 4% currently. This rate will increase when interest rates increase, and decrease when they go down. I expect your sister (after having her mortgage for 9 years) is on one of these Variable rate deals. Be under no illusion, that when interest rates rise, this rate will also rise.

I personally have a lifetime tracker mortgage from HSBC. The interest rate is 1.49% above the BOE interest rate for the life of the mortgage (so currently 1.49%+0.5% = 1.99%) of 25 years. These are good because you can benefit from the low rates for as long as they are low, and don't have to worry about remortgaging at the end of any fixed rate periods. I will always know I'll be paying 1.49% above the base rate. This spread of 1.49% is very low, and better than the spread offered on many variable mortgages (e.g your sister if paying 4.79%, which is 4.29% above the base rate!)",null,0,null,1428084164,null,0,1428084603,0,cq06426,null,t3_319mfp,null,t1_cq06426,null,t1_cpzui69,null,null,null,1432176767,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

The debates didn't actually go anywhere because none of them were willing to offer any depth to the reasoning behind their policies. It felt a lot like PMQT, more of a rehearsed politics show than anything substantial. Part of that is likely to do with the number of leaders.

I'm not so sure about the cost - we don't have negative wholesale electricity prices in the UK, like they regularly have in Germany and in California. Negative pricing effectively means that generators are paying to get rid of their electricity - for subsidised plants like wind and solar, this isn't a problem - the government gives them a guaranteed fixed price - but for conventional plant, it means that plant operators have to idle the plants and pay to get rid of their minimal power generation - or shutdown the plant, leaving it unable to provide a rapid response and putting high levels of start-up wear on the plant systems (start-up/shutdown cycles are a key feature in determining power plant lifetime).

We have the advantage that wind in the UK is reasonably season specific - it's lowest in Summer when demand is lowest, so the risk of negative pricing, even with a doubling of wind generation is low. So, there is a positive correlation with demand on a season-by-season basis.

The problem is that in Winter, wind generation is strongly inversely correlated to demand. In other words, during cold snaps, wind drops, and demand surges, causing extreme demands on rapid-acting backup plant - both in terms of quantity and response-time.

As much as I love Liverpool myself, there hasn't been consistency since Benitez managed the team. A lot of the glow got lost in the end of the last owners handling of the club, and the period after the sale has been a weird period for the club with a volatile performance ranging from rock bottom to almost clinching the top of the table. What I miss is fans at least expecting CL play and at least comforting themselves that they are very sure of reaching the last spot among the four big teams.

The danger involving Sterlings development is that he may get sold to a bigger club with more experienced players and a much wider bench, and miss out on the spotlight he is enjoying in a club that no longer is a treat to the top clubs of europe or in england at the moment.

United won't be winning the league any time soon and Chelsea have spent massively over the years, they will be guaranteed success as long as they keep spending.

You're not understanding what I am saying about Reus. After the Champions League final, he could've turned around and said 'I want to leave, Dortmund's aspirations don't match mine'. In fact, he could've said it now before he signed his contract but he didn't. Do you consider Dortmund to still have world class players in every position? No. But he believed that as an individual footballer, he would improve under Klopp and didn't see fit to move elsewhere. And the same should be about Rodgers with Sterling.

I believe that our current way of thinking is to grow with this young team and eventually be successful. I agree that if we sell as soon as we've had success then the writing on the wall is to not compete with Europe's elite but to maintain a good enough standard. But we haven't reached that and that may not be the policy at all. Sterling's suddenly become too big for his boots about winning things. He's 20.

Each Option depends severity of the crime with least severest being first. 

Option A: The criminal will serve out their time in a British Jail, then shipped back to their country of birth after the sentence is done.

Option B1: The criminal is shipped back to their home country where they will carry out their sentence according to their home countries rules, while being over watched by the British Government to ensure the term is carried out. 

Option B2: The criminal is shipped back to their home country where they will carry out their sentence according to the U.K's rules, while being over watched by the British Government to ensure the term is carried out.

Option C: The criminal serves their sentence in the U.K and then continues their sentence if the home country has a longer sentence for the crime committed. 

All three scenario's see that the criminal in question is suspended from all future travel to the United Kingdom. In turn, all U.K citizens will see that they are treated the same way in foreign countries.

---

&gt;Saganowski joined Southampton initially on loan on 30 January 2007 until the end of the 2006–07 season.  He made a successful start to his Saints career, scoring ten goals in his first 13 league games including a [hat-trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick#Association_football) in the 6–0 defeat of [Wolverhampton Wanderers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.) on 31 March 2007.  His goals helped lift the Saints out of the doldrums they were in at the end of January and push them into a play-off position. Although he featured in both play-off games he failed to score despite hitting the post as Saints went out to [Derby County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_County_F.C.) in a [penalty shoot-out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football\)).

Best estimate is that with current battery technology, on a commercial basis utility-level reliability basis - to store 5p worth of electricity, you have to pay 25-50p. Obviously, cheaper solutions can be made by keen DIYers using 2nd hand inverters and reconditioned 2nd-hand fork-lift batteries, etc. but that's not really a utility grade solution.

So battery technology has the problem - why would you pay 25-50p to store 1 kWh of electricity, when for 5p you could buy some from a gas or coal power station?

The trial battery storage units have a use where the problem is getting power from the national grid. There are a number of towns and areas in the country where the power lines from the strong ""supergrid"" to the local grid are at maximum capacity. Upgrading the power lines may be cost prohibitive if the amount of new capacity required is low, in relation to the existing capacity. A new power line on pylons or wooden poles can cost £2-4 million per mile, assuming you can get it past planners. It is becoming increasingly difficult to get power lines past planners, and in urban areas, the population density may make it infeasible anyway - in which case you are looking at underground lines - typically £20-50 million per mile.

----------------------------------------------------------------
On August 9th 1971 ""Internment without Trial"" was introduced by the British Government in Northern Ireland. Men and women, young and old, were arrested and jailed without trial or reason. This was a date that would change the lives of Joan’s family forever. On this August evening the Parachute regiment of the British Army murdered Joan, a 45 year old mother of eight.

Joan was shot as she left her place of safety and went to the aid of a young boy (Noel Phillips) who was shot and wounded by the same regiment. **Joan was shot several times in the head and body, with injuries so severe that part of her face was blown off**. Joan's autopsy report indicates that Joan bled to death. Eye witnesses of the events claim Joan was blatantly refused emergency medical attention, even as she cried out for help.

The murder of Joan, the only woman shot in Ballymurphy during one of the trouble's worse events, left husband Denis without a wife and left eight children without a mother. The extent of Joan’s injuries was so horrific that Denis struggled to identify her body; he finally did on his third attempt aided only by Joan's red hair.

Whether or not it's true or not, the feeling was that the North shared Scotland's tendency toward 'progressive' politics, while the perception of the South was that it was the heartland of Conservative support.

Of course the North wouldn't want to just up and stop being English, but the point I'm making is the SNP's support is less based on rampant nationalism and more on the fact that a left-wing expression of the utter disillusionment with Westminster appears to be a Scottish phenomenon.

&gt; Of 33 economists surveyed by the Centre for Macroeconomics two thirds disagreed with the proposition that the Government&amp;#039;s policies since 2010 have had a &amp;quot;Positive effect&amp;quot; on the economy.

&gt; Richard Portes of the London Business School said the UK&amp;#039;s recovery since 2013 was a consequence of the Government&amp;#039;s easing of austerity.

&gt; The Treasury&amp;#039;s own forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, estimates that the Government&amp;#039;s austerity was a drag on GDP growth in these years.

Also if Rom is committed to this club he should know much better than to hire this notorious dickhead. If however though Roms wishes are a move in the summer and he doesn't want to play for us anymore well then him and Kev can leave and make us £50-£60m. Can't stand players disrespecting the club and even more so when they are in no position to disrespect. If Rom was still at Chelsea he'd be on the bench and starting cup games. At Juve again on the bench behind Tevez and Morata. Wolfsburg would be the only choice he had on the table that he would've been given proper playing time at and theyre no better than us. In fact we've proved this season we are better than them. 

I hope Rom sees sense if he doesn't feel this way and sacks this idiot but if not I can see Rom leaving and jumping ship as soon as he can but it will be the biggest mistake of his career. Just think if he leaves us in the summer what ""big"" team would pay the extraordinary fee we'd demand and have the right to demand and what team aside from us and others in our position would put up with his form? PSG? City? Juve? None would because they all have equally good and better options than him. He isn't good enough to be the #1 at a ""big"" club no where near it.

As an Arsenal fan, you don't ever have to worry about top 4.  It's a done deal.  Sealed etc... But that's it!  The rest is all disappointment.  We nearly won the frigin' league last year.  

I agree that after Benitez, we had a really bumpy ride and I too was wondering wtf with all the strange signings and managers coming and going.  We had no identity.  The new ownership and BR are starting to prove they have a long term plan and it's exciting.  There is no more exciting team to watch in the PL.  You want rock solid defense and patient build up play, look elsewhere.  Mignolet is in goal behind a back three with a young German midfielder and anything can happen!

I agree with you.  I don't think we have the kind of squad to guarantee top 4 every season.  We've got too many youth players and not a deep enough squad to really compete in the CL anyway.  We also don't have the kind of owners that can afford to fix that right away (not to mention Fair Rules making that tougher.)  I'm okay with that.  And I think most of our players (even Sterling) are okay with that.  But I think we just have to convince the fans and the players we are on the right track and that the end result is not going to be Man United 2003 or Man City Last Season or Chelsea this season.  The end result is going to be Liverpool.  And it's going to be a team you're going to be proud to have been a part of.

I'm not blind to all of Liverpool's faults.  I think BR cost us the League in two games last season.  He didn't seem to understand that a draw with Chelsea was just fine and the goal differential was insurmountable.  He's young and I hope he learned from those mistakes. 

Back to Sterling.  I don't think he's desperate for the CL just yet.  I also don't think he has his heart set on any team, like Suarez with Barca.  I think he's young and he's trying not to make any mistakes now that he'll regret later.  This is more a test of LFC management and its fans than a test of Sterling.

Yeah, there's really not.  You could probably name about 10 famous scientists in the past century for every scientist who professes faith.  

Is Freeman Dyson religious?  Maybe a little bit.  He goes to church, but he's more of a cultural Christian.  [According to Wikipedia, Dyson says:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson#Science_and_religion)

null,false,DrHydeous,null,null,null,"A one month season between St Albans and London is £290.70. It's only £391 if you then add an all-zones Travelcard.

Given that you're so obviously trying to pull a fast one there, I checked your ticket from Naas to Dublin. Iarnrod Eirrean's website says a one month ticket between Sallins/Naas and Heuston is E164. E119 will only get you as far as Park West And Cherry Orchard on the outskirts of Dublin. I think we should be fair and compare fares with like fares. For £391, you can get from St Albans to central London, and then use all buses, trains, tubes and trams in London, as much as you like. From Naas that means spending E164 to get to Heuston. You then need to spend a further E171 for an ""Adult Monthly Short Hop"" ticket to give you the freedom of Dublin's much smaller transport network, for a total of E335, or £246.

If we look at the commute my father did before he retired - Bexhill to East Croydon on the outskirts of London - that's £271.20 a month for a 70 mile journey. That's cheaper per mile than Naas to Park West And Cherry Orchard.

So, well done, you found an expensive ticket, and it's still more expensive (but nothing like as expensive as you tried to make it look like) when you compare like with like. I agreee, there exist anomalies (and there are some much bigger ones than this - compare prices for season tickets between Croydon and Horsham and Croydon and Brighton). However, their existence does not demonstrate that train travel here is expensive in general. At most, it demonstrates that the fare structure is different. As a result of the fare structure being different, some journeys look expensive, and some look cheap. Overall I find that, at least for the journeys I make - and I travel extensively by train both here and abroad, both for work and for leisure - tickets here tend to be cheaper.",null,0,null,1428088468,null,0,false,0,cq08p9g,null,t3_31as6k,null,t1_cq08p9g,null,t1_cq05pdk,null,null,null,1432177987,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

A better option is tidal power. Tides are slow and predictable. By ""damming"" up water in estuaries you can store the energy for a period allowing a degree of response to demand. The disadvantages are extreme environmental impact and vast cost - you completely change the dynamics of the water in the estuary and disturb the unique and sensitive ecosystems. Environmental mitigations necessitate reductions in the energy collectable and storage capability (often by huge margins). Cost is also exceptionally high - with costs for the power generated ranging from £250/MWh to £1200/MWh based upon a 120 year working life for the system.

If not, then your fortunes are already heavily tied to house prices (with leverage!) If you bet even more on the upside of the property market, either by buying a bigger house or a BTL, you're making a big gamble, and could win big, or lose big. Even with a rising property market, you're talking about only one or two properties, which is terribly un-diversified - local factors could do you in even in a rising market. If you buy a bigger house than you need (and don't, say, let out rooms) then from a financial point of view you have an asset not earning income and are *purely* speculating on price rises. 

I don't think anyone can give you a ""correct"" answer, but without substantial other investments I personally would likely seek to lower the interest rate and put spare money either in to paying-off the mortgage quicker (depending on fees for over-payment, etc) or investing in non-property assets.

Having said that I don't hate them. My local Lib Dem MP is quite good (as are many in their constituencies) and I like the stance they take on things like drugs policy, energy, and civil liberties.

But, there's no way a KLR will keep up with an er-6 on open roads unless your friend is very patient, I've spent time and effort tweaking mine to get a little extra (klx carb mod, bigger jets, drilled carb slide, open exhaust, pod filter) and I'd be surprised if it makes more than 45bhp.. and with me on it (6'3"", heavy and broad) it tops out at ~70mph with 60mph being it's comfortable cruising speed.

If you're set on a klr650 though, and I still say they're great bikes if you're willing to accept the limitations, there are a few things I'd do to make it better for distance:

- Hagon progressive front fork springs &amp; 10wt oil (maybe 15wt if you're really heavy / carrying a lot of gear) the front suspension on a klr is really soft, if you're not off-roading stiffen it up.

- front fork brace, do a web search for Eagle Mike (US Aftermarket parts builder, makes good quality stuff for KLRs), the front forks on KLRs are very thin, the brace makes a good improvement.

- whilst you're on eagle-mike's site it's worth investing in a drill-through rear subframe kit, this replaces the two bolts that hold the rear subframe onto the top of the main frame with one long bolt. If you're planning long distance with heavy gear it's better safe than sorry

- Ask the seller if the KLR has had the ""doohickey"" upgrade - the main mechanical weak spot on a KLR is the engine balancer adjuster, they can wear out and snap. There's a kit to replace the lever with an uprated part &amp; spring (eagle-mike again) if it hasn't been done.

At this point you're probably looking at ~£500 plus labour time added onto the purchase cost of the bike, you'll end up with a pretty bombproof bike but it'll still be slow, depending on your budget have you looked at the KLE650 (Versys)? it's a parallel twin dual-sport, they look a bit weird but they're really good. If you're not going further off-road than gravel tracks it'd be faster and more comfortable than a KLR :)

I kind of know where you are coming from. I started a university course that I hated, dropping out was one of the best decisions I have made in my life. Sticking with that course would have made me horribly unhappy and I'd have been run into the ground. Granted, I went on to study something else and I absolutely love it - the difference in studying something I don't enjoy to studying something I do enjoy is as clear as night and day.

If you aren't happy studying at uni right now, don't do it! My friend recently dropped out of his degree half way through (2 out of 4 years!), he struggled for a month or two but he's now working as an apprentice of sorts with an accountant. 

He was worried he might be able to make something of him self outside of uni as well, but not only is he very much doing better than any of my other friends, he's a much happier bloke now.

There are plenty of apprenticeships that are a waste of time, but there are just as many degrees that are a waste of time too. There are some absolutely fantastic apprenticeships on offer!

We (as in people in the early late teens to mid 20's generation) seem to have had it well and truly drilled into us that no degree = no success. Sure, plenty of jobs do require a degree. But plenty of them don't, and despite it being an old cliche, being happy is probably worth more than making another £5k a year...

Instead, I think sterling's just saying it would have been easy to sign last year when we were riding high and only looked like getting better. Pretty obvious. 

I agree with sterling somewhat: he's still got 2 years left on his contract, why would he want to jump in and commit straight away to an even longer one when he's seen how incredibly inconsistent and poor this team can be. We've lost players and dropped off significantly while others are only getting stronger. It's hardly inviting. No wonder he wants to wait. 

Also, comparing him to Henderson is a bit daft because Henderson hasn't been linked to Madrid, Barca, Bayern, City etc over the years.

I think the requirement for Irish in certain jobs and education would certainly be dropped. I can't see any reason why in a united Ireland there wouldn't be Parades and Bonfires (no tires of course!), there is an Annual Parade in Donegal every year.

&gt; You argue that such things are linked to economy. Like the economic problems that hit every country after unification?

Like where, Germany? Most of the difficulties facing Germany where due to to two separate Economic Models, State Socialism and Capitalism as well as differing levels of development. Of which none is relevant to this situation.

They could stagnate the entire political system through protest votes. If you honestly don't think that Tribal politics could do that you haven't been paying attention to Stormont.

I think it would be wonderful to have active engaged citizens participating in the democratic process, but you just can't call referendums at the drop of a hat.

null,false,holyjesusitsahorse,null,null,null,"I'm late coming to this, and it's been a while since I dealt with these sorts of things, but:

- There are certain exemptions to normal contractual law when it comes to utilities. In principle, if you buy a house, go inside and start running the taps, you've agreed to pay the going rate for the water. If you didn't have that, you'd have to have someone come round and physically disconnect and reconnect supply every time someone moved out. So you'd struggle to get anywhere on the contractual issue alone.

- You can, however, ask for a new prepayment meter to be fitted (I'm assuming that this is something that your landlord is happy with). If they ask for a fee, call around other suppliers and most of them will be happy to do it for free, particularly if it gets them new custom. Beware that if you have an outstanding debt (real or imagined) they may load this into the new prepayment meter.

- As has been mentioned, they're subject to the back-billing code. Anything older than 12 months (than the actual paper bill) they shouldn't be asking you for, and if they do, point to that and politely shoo them off.

- Also as mentioned, you can't go straight to the Ombudsman, they'll tell you to go through normal channels first, but those normal channels are that you write a letter headed ""COMPLAINT"", detail the information here, the multiple visits, the fact that you've been threatened with a back-bill, the fact that they clearly had the wrong meter registered on *their* systems, and then send this recorded delivery. Honestly, that may be enough. If all you've done is talk to somebody in a call-centre, their default position is going to be ""send us a reading"", because that's what it says on their sheet and they normally don't have the authority to write off a debt over the phone.

- If they then don't resolve the complaint within eight weeks, or they send you a deadlock letter (a final decision against you), you can *then* go to the Ombudsman and state your case. Although you do pay more for prepayment than contract, you could potentially highlight here that you missed out on being able to sign up for cheaper tariffs in the period that they didn't inform you that you were using a standard meter.

I'd also be interested as to what was happening with the other meter. Was it just charging you for a standing charge? If not, that's also presumably hooked up to something and would need to be resolved. I'd consider asking them to refund any funds you put into it if they don't choose to write off the back payment.

The initial claim was that Labour has always relied on Scotland to win. That isn't true because without Scottish MPs they still would have had a majority. For the future perhaps it is a consideration, but it's false to suggest Labour have relied on Scotland in the past which is what I was responding to. If you remove Labour's Scottish MPs from calculations you have to remove all the others too.

You can't remove Labour's MPs from the 2005 election and leave in the rest of the Scottish MPs for other parties to say Labour then wouldn't have had a majority.

&gt;* The S&amp;E region of the Republic of Ireland (consisting of [Munster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munster), Counties [Dublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin), [Wicklow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Wicklow), [Meath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Meath), [Kildare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kildare), [Kilkenny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kilkenny), [Carlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Carlow), [Wexford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Wexford)).

&gt;Throughout the 1990s, the Northern Ireland economy grew faster than did the economy of the rest of the UK, due in part to the Celtic Tiger rapid growth of the economy of the Republic of Ireland and the so-called ""peace dividend"". Growth slowed to the pace of the rest of the UK during the down-turn of the early years of the new millennium, but growth has since rebounded; in 2005, the Northern Irish economy is estimated to have grown by 3.2%, almost twice as fast as the UK as a whole, and future growth is expected to be stronger than that of the rest of the United Kingdom,  though lower than that of the Republic. In April 2007 a [Halifax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_(United_Kingdom_bank\)) survey found Northern Ireland's average house price to one of the highest in the UK, behind London, the South East and the South West. It also found Northern Ireland to have all of the top ten property ""hot spots"", with the [Craigavon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigavon) and [Newtownards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtownards) areas increasing by 55%.

The party's strength has always been at the local level, and this government has demonstrated that.

The population of Newham, consists of a large number of immigrants. Recent immigration rates are high, and include large number of people from regions where TB is endemic.

There are a large number of illegal immigrants, a large number of migrants who are uneducated and unskilled, are unable to speak English and may be illiterate even in their native language. It is therefore very difficult to educate people about TB.

For many reasons, there are groups of the population who view the normal authorities with suspicion and try to minimize contact with authority, including the NHS.

TB is seen as a highly stigmatising disease, and people actively refuse to go for TB screening. There is a well resourced TB screening program in Newham.

There is poor compliance with treatment - again, likely due to poor education and difficulty communicating. Fewer than 10% of people in Newham given treatment for TB actually finish the antibiotics. Similarly, high levels of migration within or to neighbouring boroughs may mean that people miss the opportunity for vaccination (which is given routinely to all babies born in Newham, but not necessarily in other parts of London).",null,0,null,1428098044,null,0,false,0,cq0e4jx,null,t3_31c8nt,null,t1_cq0e4jx,null,t1_cq0dkhi,null,null,null,1432180614,null,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22,null

To (not) answer your question - I simply can't say to you that it would be safe to tackle a very small fire, you would have to use your judgement, but as that judgement is based on no experience then the safest thing by far is to leave and phone the fire service.

Why. Because you think so? 

&gt; I can't see any reason why in a united Ireland there wouldn't be Parades and Bonfires (no tires of course!), there is an Annual Parade in Donegal every year.

Are you serious the parade in Donegal is an entirely different thing to the 12th in Belfast. they burn Tri-colours, their are riots, their are people collapsed drunk everywhere at one in the afternoon. I don't know if your Naive or blindly ignorant.

&gt;Like where, Germany? Most of the difficulties facing Germany where due to to two separate Economic Models, State Socialism and Capitalism as well as differing levels of development. Of which none is relevant to this situation.

And what side is west Germany here? West Germany carried the east Germany economy and it still does. the Republic cannot support NI. you want examples of what unification looks like when neither side has the economic support to do it? it looks like Yemen.

Thats completely forgetting that unifying countries changes nothing other than the boarder on a map. Why is East Germany so much poorer than west Germany even after 20 years. Why is south Italy so much poorer than Northern Italy. money in a UI won't go to  Belfast it'll go to Dublin, under devolution in the UK can remain competitive, but how you could maintain that in UI is unknown.

&gt;I think it would be wonderful to have active engaged citizens participating in the democratic process, but you just can't call referendums at the drop of a hat.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;At the __Battle of Edington__ an army of the [Anglo-Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon) kingdom of [Wessex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wessex) under [Alfred the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_the_Great) defeated the [Great Heathen Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Heathen_Army) led by [Guthrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrum) on a date between 6 and 12 May AD 878. The primary sources locate the battle at ""Ethandun"" or ""Ethandune"", and until a scholarly consensus identified its location with the present-day [Edington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edington,_Wiltshire) in [Wiltshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltshire) it was known as the __Battle of Ethandun__, a name which continues to be used.

&gt;The battle soon resulted in the [Treaty of Wedmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Wedmore) later the same year.

&gt;*TO COMMEMORATE THE BATTLE OF ETHANDUN FOUGHT IN THIS VICINITY MAY 878 AD WHEN KING ALFRED THE GREAT DEFEATED THE VIKING ARMY, GIVING BIRTH TO THE ENGLISH NATIONHOOD. UNVEILED BY THE 7TH MARQUESS OF BATH 5TH NOVEMBER 2000.*

&gt;An additional inscription reads:

&gt;*THIS STONE, PRESENTED BY F. SWANTON AND SONS, NORTH FARM, WEST OVERTON, IS A SARSEN STONE SIMILAR TO THOSE AT KINGSTON DEVERILL, THE AREA WHERE KING ALFRED RALLIED SAXON LEVIES FROM HAMPSHIRE, WILTSHIRE AND SOMERSET TO MARCH AGAINST GUTHRUM'S VIKING ARMY BASED AT CHIPPENHAM.*

&gt; Are you serious the parade in Donegal is an entirely different thing to the 12th in Belfast. they burn Tri-colours, their are riots, their are people collapsed drunk everywhere at one in the afternoon. I don't know if your Naive or blindly ignorant.

So it won't be much different in a united Ireland and not unlike St.Paddy's Day in Temple Bar.

&gt; And what side is west Germany here?

Well it's certainly not the North

&gt; West Germany carried the east Germany economy and it still does.

Again this is the legacy of a transition between two very different economic models
 
&gt;  the Republic cannot support NI. you want examples of what unification looks like when neither side has the economic support to do it

It won't be ""supported"" it will become an active part of the economy; regardless of whether or not there is a United Ireland, the days of NI being supported are over, the clear intention from westminister is to remove the heavy subsidies from this failed state.

&gt; Why is south Italy so much poorer than Northern Italy.

What's your point here? Italy was never partitioned, its legacy of state building leaves a lot to be desired, but i might as well ask why is the North of England so much poorer than the south of England?

&gt; under devolution in the UK can remain competitive

Well that clearly isn't true is it, it's certainly not competitive now.

&gt; Look at how many referendums there are, the republic loves them, unionist populations could legitimately destroy the republic after unification.

Again i don't think you understand the process; you can't call a referendum at the drop of a hat and even so, if they wish to vote for or against an amendment to the constitution that is their democratic right.

I'd like to see this lineup

                                   Mignolet


           Manquillo         Can             Sakho          Moreno



                                     Lucas

         Henderson                                             Lallana

                                   Coutinho

               Sturridge                            Sterling


While I think Sterling has proven devastating at the tip of the diamond in the past, he's also proven deadly this season leading the line/pressing high. I also waived having Balotelli because I think Sterling and Sturridge can press well together. I've loved Allen's renaissance of late, but I think Lucas is more equipped to deal with Giroud. Henderson picks himself, and I think this is Lallana's ideal position in this formation. 

Bench: Balotelli, Lambert, Marko, Toure, Allen, Enrique, Ward.

This formation could come as a surprise to Wenger, and I think it puts more bodies in midfield, and a more consistent press, which I think Arsenal could find hard to cope with.

2005 election, Labour had 355 seats. All other parties combined had 289 seats. 324 seats were required to form a majority government. Labour achieved this and had a majority of 66 (the difference between their seats and the opposition seats, i.e. 355 - 289).

If the 41 Labour MPs elected by Scotland had instead been any other party, Labour would have had 314 seats versus the combined opposition of 330. This would have been a hung parliament. Labour would have been unable to form a majority government.

Note that when people say the government *has a majority of 66*, this can be counter-intuitive. You would think that 41 MPs wouldn't matter if the majority is 66. But a majority of 66 actually only requires 33 MPs to overturn. This is because an MP not only leaves the government but also joins the opposition.

The SNP withdrew their support because a Labour MP introduced a ""[40% rule](http://www.scottishpoliticalarchive.org.uk/wb/pages/referendum/1979/40-rule.php)"" into the devolution referendum which meant that even though 52% of votes were yes it was deemed to have not passed.
