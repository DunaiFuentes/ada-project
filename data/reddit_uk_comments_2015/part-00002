If you liked Call the Midwife &amp; Dr Who you might also like historical, drama/comedy/weirdness like:

Black Adder,

Foyle's War, 

Mapp &amp; Lucia (1985-86 with Geraldine McEwan, Prunella Scales and Nigel Hawthorne (for my money it beats the one that just came out starring Miranda Richardson and Anna Chancellor)), 

and Upstairs Downstairs.

If you liked Sherlock and Peaky Blinders, you might also like: 

Inspector Frost, 

Agatha Christie's Marple starring Joan Hickson (NOT the Geraldine McEwan/Julia McKenzie version - they're *adaptations* that take unwarranted liberties with the PLOTS fer gawd's sake!), 

Wallander starring Kenneth Branagh (though we prefer the Swedish version w/ English subtitles starring Krister Henriksson, but you did ask for Brit shows), 

Vera starring Brenda Blethyn as DCI Vera Stanhope

and Case Histories starring the wonderful Jason Isaacs (Harry Potter's Lucius Malfoy) as Jackson Brodie, a former Edinburgh cop trying to make a living as a private detective.

And for a general Brit sitcom you could try The IT Crowd.  Stars Chris O'Dowd, Richard Ayoade, Katherine Parkinson and Matt Berry.  Some of the lines like, ""Leg disabled"" which make no sense if you haven't seen the show, have become standards in this family, right up there with Monty Python's, ""Run Away!""

Some people got to remember you weren't born Liverpool to be optimistic ; you were made a Kopites to be winners.

Are you optimistic about what? That every single year we spent the same money with title contenders and the vast majority of the years we end up with 95% mediocre players? Are you optimistic that after a finally good season, the next one we most propably won't gonna make a Champions League place?

Most of the fans have grown not to be demanding at all. No winner attitude, no nothing. No demands from the board, from the coach, from the players. Only hopes and sighs at the end of every PL. You end up with Lovrens and Lallanas when most of the title contenders are or are building war machines. And you put up with that. You place blind trust on the board and actually never ever remind them what kind of team we should be.

Without Stevie G, you can only imagine the last 20 years would be far deeper dipped in mediocrity. Yes, with Liverpool through the harsh and with Liverpool through the good ones, but 20 years isn't a simple drought; it's becoming a standard. We do Christmas leveled up with Swansea and West Ham on the table, and it apparently is all good; have faith, support the team, better days will come. 

Liverpool becomes every year a smaller club. And next year without Stevie's leadership do expect far worse. Liverpool needs 2 things.

1) Another coach. Brendan Rodgers has lost the game. There is no plan. The players don't play for the coach anymore. He's lost their trust. He's finished from Liverpool. Every game he sits on the bench, Liverpool will keep gasping for its life in the ER. I am not saying he is a bad coach. He's just over at Liverpool. Nobody can look at him the same way. No locker rooms, no success. He seems not knowing what he's doing. I can't believe he's worked next to Mourinho and this is a defence he is proud to present. 

2) The new coach should be an ESTABLISHED coach. No Hogson, Dalgish and stuff like that. He comes in, get every single key from the Anfield, and brings in ESTABLISHED players. Give a BIG coach (like Del Bosque, Ancelotti, Klop, Scolari, Capello, Conte, Trappatoni) or an at least PROMISING but yet ESTABLISHED on winning championships (like Klopp, Valverde, Luxemburgo e.t.c.). No more bets, no more Andy Carols, 1/3 of the budget for talents and rest for NAMES who know what it is to WIN, to be a CHAMPION, like all the other title contenders do with players like Fabregas, Sanchez, Mata, Di Maria, Falcao e.t.c.",null,0,null,1420231843,null,0,false,0,cncgsg9,null,t3_2r36oq,null,t1_cncgsg9,null,t3_2r36oq,null,null,null,1425095382,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

If.its less than 45p/mile (might be a bit more nowadays) if you drive your own car you can also claim back the tax on the difference in rate.  At a prior firm we could only claim 12p a mile. With the annual mileage I was doing I got an extra £1500 added to my tax free allowance.

A friend of mine had a VW bluemotion jetta as his company car which took £3,100 of his allowance.  Like you at the time I got £4,500 annual allowance.  After tax (40%) the swing was £3,600 per year to run a car.  I ended up getting a the year old Mercedes, which was a lot of fun but turned out to be an unreliable dog of a car (I was unlucky with it) and even with the repair work, insurances, etc, it only cost me an extra £50 a year  compared to my friends Jetta and at the end I still had the car as an asset I could sell.

I looked again recently, again at a Mercedes but this time a brand new one and the swing, without the mileage claim) was £450 a month and leasing the car was £400 pm so there wasn't much in it.

Basically I think if you don't go new the allowance will give you more money but you'll have to pay for repairs. Its typical that once people have a family and they need a car to be on the road they opt for the company car.

null,false,BraveSirRobin,null,null,null,"&gt; it just looks like the police and the CPS were trying it on because they ""knew he did it""

I guess so in some cases but occasionally it comes down to things like the credibility of witnesses where there is a strong case but they jury just isn't convinced on the day. 

A great example could be the modern discovery DNA evidence to a historic case. It's sensible that such evidence should be allowed to exonerate an innocent person via an appeal so why shouldn't a miscarriage of justice in the opposite direction also make use of this?

The main argument for having double jeopardy limitations is to prevent a malicious state from using repeated trials as a form of harassment. I'd say it was possible to satisfy this goal while still having an occasional retrail.

&gt; Perhaps I'd be more in favour of this if there was a third verdict - that besides guilty and not guilty, the jury could declare that you'd been proved innocent, and CPS could never come after you again.

Hmmm, that creates it's own issues. We already have this in Scotland via the fairly unique [""not proven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_proven)"" verdict. Most nations which inherited aspects of Scot's Law dropped this but it's still in occasional use here. 

It's sometimes called ""the bastard verdict"" and the joke is that it means ""not guilty and don't do it again"". It's not quite as you describe but it pushed ""not guilty"" into being the ""innocent"" verdict you suggest, with this being the middle ground. 

The big issue is that it's the flipside of the ""beyond reasonable doubt"" ideal. When is someone ""more not guilty"" than others? People who get the ""not proven"" verdict have a stain on their character which AFAIK cannot be appealed or removed from their public record.

So Currys salespeople are also misleading people into thinking they have to pay for iCloud and instead go for their service.

If the racists outweigh the non racists, certain worldviews are isolated and certain worldviews are ramped up beyond all reason. 

It's all well and good saying ""everyone gets a voice and the most reasonable one wins"" - in an ideal world I would agree that's how it *should* go... but it only takes a quick flick through an American, Rwandan, German or Bosniak history book to see this isn't how it works out in the end. 

It only takes a quick flick trough /r/Worldnews to see no amount of dissent or sources is going to stop that train once it gets going. Once the ""kill the other"" mindset reaches 50% it's basically game over until it's reached it's logical conclusion. 

That's why ""hate speech"" laws exist, because no matter what I say as a gay man or any evidence I have, it doesn't take much for the majority population to ignore everything and just do their thing if it appeals to their prejudice better and is what they want to hear. 

Free speech is a numbers game. It doesn't matter who has the truth, all that matters is who has the majority. Look at Germany, look at Rwanda, look at the increasing hate crimes towards immigrants and Muslims in the UK these past few years. It's all the same story. In all of these cases, what we call ""hate speech"" plays a primary role in setting the foundation for escalation of violence, although I would say there are groups who are at risk and groups who aren't, and these can fluctuate with time. 

So I would say gay and black people aren't so much at risk anymore, because we have majority backing, we have the science on our side and the jokes and the myths aren't taken as seriously anymore, so it's not so risky. Muslims on the other hand are still at risk, and I'd say trans people still suffer from prejudice and myths perpetuated and propagated primarily through speech, media or humour. 

So ""hate speech"" is risky for some but not others, it doesn't have to be a black and white issue, I think nuance is important here and I think you *can* draw the line when necessary and say ""this group is at risk today, this group is not"" - there doesn't need to be hysterical ""slippery slope"" fallacies when it comes to hate speech 

I think people who shrug their shoulders at hate speech or even advocate for it as part of their larger ""free speech"" campaign are either ignorant to how big of a role speech plays into escalating violence, how powerful it is, and are conveniently not part of a group who is actually at risk of suffering the real consequences and logical conclusions  of hate speech ",null,0,null,1420234214,null,0,1420235483,0,cnci4dn,null,t3_2r3kgm,null,t1_cnci4dn,null,t1_cnc5zst,null,null,null,1425094760,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

The following will cause the value of your bond to drop:

* If the risk of default increases.  
* Bonds are paid in a foreign currency and the pound rises in value.  
* If the Bank of England base rate increases sooner than expected.

The opposite will cause the bond value to increase.

There are rarely any real bond market crashes, so you could lose a few % in the short term, but it's generally seen as a safe investment (certainly cheaper &amp; safer than Funding Circle if that's your alternative).

Bennet and Bohn in 1999 estimated the cost of a UK ICU admission at about £1,000 - £1,800 per day.

For a 90 day admission in an adult intensive care unit in the UK, it would cost the NHS between £90,000 and £167,000 (that's in 1999 and doesn't include inflation).  An adult ICU admission will have different costs but is comparable.

While I don't object to your view (I find them small minded and xenophobic if not a structurally racist party), I think I speak for many here, and certainly all the mod team, when I say that we're fed up of you constantly interjecting your opinion that UKIP is a racist party, especially when said opinion has nothing to do with the subject at hand. This thread is just one such example. It serves only to antagonise other users of the subreddit and to derail the debate at hand. It adds nothing to the discussion that we haven't heard before.

So I will ask, this once, that you **either engage with the subject at hand in each thread or refrain from posting at all**. We will be much less judicious about removing posts that threaten to derail the subject at hand because we feel we have given you plenty of chances, and now you return from another short term ban and your posting behaviour has not changed a bit. If you prove yourself unable to change your conduct in this forum, then we will have to curtail your ability to post here. This is a moderated space and your conduct thus far has not been acceptable.

This has been dealt with by a public post rather than a PM because we wish to be seen to be dealing with such uncourteous behaviour while showing neither fear nor favour to users of all political persuasions. This forum arose from the need to escape obnoxious right wing posters in UKP but we don't tolerate such behaviour from users on any side of the political spectrum.

No they're not.

See this is what happens when you google something and don't understand what the question is, let alone the answer. Those are limits on driving time which doesn't include other non-driving work, such as loading/unloading, or driving breaks. Because of the requirements for daily rests (11hrs a day which may be reduced to 9hrs three times a week) and weekly rests (45hrs which may be reduced to 24hrs every other week), the total duty time you can do is 84hrs (3x15 + 3x13) but only every other week as you have to have a full uninterrupted weekly rest period of 45 hrs every other week plus pay back the reduction of the 45hr weekly rest period you took in the week you did 84hrs.

A truck driver on one of the few jobs exempt from the EU Drivers Hours Regulations driving under GB Domestic Rules is limited to a maximum 11hr working day but there is no weekly rest period requirement so they could work 77hrs a week in perpetuity.

We had a blistering run of form in the first 15 or so games but now we've slumped into inconsistency which is akin to that of a mid-table club. A mixture of a young, inexperienced side and some attitude issues resulting in suspensions has caused us to drop points where we really shouldn't, such as to teams like Telford and Alfreton.

A real talking point this season though has to be the officiating, it is just terrible, I get that refereeing is hard and comes with tough decisions but they always seem to make something out of nothing like they get a bonus for producing cards or giving penalties.

As for the players themselves, we have some exciting prospects in our squad, most notably Luke Young, our board will have to show some real grit to keep him through January, though I think they'll accept any 6-figure number given our finances. In terms of goal-scorers Bowman could do with being more prolific but he has promise. A disappointment for me this season has to be Ashley Yeoman, after a run of form at the end of last season I thought he'd be banging them in constantly. His opportunities have been limited though so I suppose CH is seeing something he doesn't like on the training ground.

In conclusion I think we can make a late run into the playoff spots, but will probably get beaten by Rovers in the final, as I see Barnet taking the automatic spot.

Best result: Beating Barnet 3-2 at their ground on TV.

Your main argument seems to be that the French found it first, gave it to Spain, and when South America claimed Independence from Spain it claimed all the land that came with it in the region. 

This is probably correct but there are a number of issues. First all of the territory was always been in dispute. Britain doesn't appear to have recognised Spain's claim or Frances right to sign it over. When the colonising nations left the islands they both left it with plaques claiming their own sovereignty over the islands. The entire history around then seems to be a giant game of who said what. 

Either way it doesn't matter. Getting there first doesn't not automatically give you a claim of ownership. Look at how many countries around the world change changed hands multiple times. Do you really think you are going to win a claim on the islands by going back hundreds of years to France/Spain/Argentina?  

The longest inhabitation of the islands have been by Britain. Here is the timeline of when people have lived on the Islands: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Falklands.permanence.png.

You can't claim these people are invaders. They've been there for many generations. 

Incidentally Britain has tried to take to the International court. Argentina refuses.
The UN does take dim-view of colonies but it places a higher importance of self-determination so you won't win there. 
Argentina tried to take it by force. They lost.
Britain isn't going to give up the islands whilst the islanders want to remain British.

So nothing is going to change. I don't actually know what you want to happen? ",null,0,null,1420237203,null,0,false,0,cncjqap,null,t3_2r216c,null,t1_cncjqap,null,t1_cncanpv,null,null,null,1425093938,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I'm all for letting Fazio and Vertonghen develop a partnership, but we cannot rely on them to play every minute. 

We also need a striker who can spell Kane. Maybe that's Soldado given more time (who knows how long though), but I doubt it's Adebayor. Kane cannot continue to play as much as he has.

And the same goes for Eriksen. There's really no one who can do what does as effectively, but as it stands right now he's playing too many minutes and will get hurt or burn out. Maybe Lamela could fill his role, but that remains to be seen.

I said the same with regards to our deeper midfielders elsewhere in this thread. Overall, I think we have a large squad but the relative lack of rotation indicates to me that Pochettino doesn't really trust many of the players who aren't in that group of say 15-17 players that are getting all the minutes.

This has the effect that even if you, theoretically, get the most hypothetical hippy dippy policeman partnered with a meat head, queen and country belching thug. THey will still co-operate and if need be, lie to back each other up.

Overall I have very little, baseline respect for the police. Because it is riddled with ""law unto themselves"" thugs, who dominate the institutional attitudes and gain praise from higher ranks who essentially dictate power.

GO to a picket line, don't know if you're active or go many demonstrations, or what your particular view points are. Go to any picket line which is displaying the grievances of workers with their management.

As a Uruguayan, watching Pepe Mujica try to push Latin American unity by jointly rejecting the British from our ports and then within two years get spit on by Kichner (by blocking our ports and bridges along with illegal tariffs) has made me realize that the Argentine government is simply unable to be negotiated with because they break every agreement they ever sign.

Argentine governments are very poor at diplomacy and the chances of anything to change with the Falklands is slim to none.

Britain has offered to take it to the International Court but your Government has refused. Fair enough, Britain know they would win due to the right to self-determination otherwise they wouldn't have offered it. Still, it's not an option Argentina have taken. 

Argentina have also refused any trade deals because in doing so they would help legitimise Britain's claims to the islands. Argentina's position is that the islands belong to Argentina and that the current administration on the Island is illegitimate. Talking to them and doing a deal with them will be de-facto acceptance of their position. 

By the way it's worth reading up on why Argentina invaded in the first place. Britain was scaling back it's empire across the world and it had no real desire to keep the Falklands either. So it withdrew a lot of military from the islands and then Argentina bet we wouldn't defend them. However giving away the islands is different from having them invaded so we had to take them back and now Britons died defended it it's impossible to ever give them away. 

If you want this to be taken to court or for Argentina and the Falklands to begin trading then you need to take it up with your own government. Britain is fine with either of these, you don't need to convince us. 

The real situation here is that there won't be any discussions because they isn't any prospect of an agreement, Argentina can't take it by force, Argentina won't go to court and the UN isn't going to force the UK to do anything as the right to self-determination conflicts with the no-colonies policy.

I'd say you could probably do level 1 courses (two modules at once) as well as working full time, but level 2 and 3 would definitely be a struggle unless you have some knowledge regarding it already. 

To be fair friends are usually surprised I still manage doing full time work and a uni degree on top, as it takes a lot of dedication, planning and general commitment. I'm not saying you don't have this, but really do be realistic in whether or not you'll keep up with it.

Having said that, the OU do have 10 or 30 point short courses, as well as things like FutureLearn, which may be worth trying and seeing how you get on with to dip your toe.

- Salah has played on the left wing.

- Reus played second striker/striker for most of the time at Monchengladbach prior to playing predominantly out left at Dortmund. He also started the CL final in the #10 role.

- Ronaldo was played on the right at United before playing on the left at Madrid.

- Bale played left back, left wing, some bizarre roaming position at the end of his time at Spurs, before playing largely out right at Madrid.

- Robben played on the left wing early in his career. He's also played through the middle for the Netherlands.

Our defence is a shambles nothing good to say about that I'm afraid. 

As far as losing Stevie goes he wouldn't have been getting games next year which is why he is going. If he was in Rodgers plans he would stay so obviously Brendan has told him he will only get a handful of games and sub appearances (which IMO is all Gerrard is up to these days 90 minutes a week seems like too much for his legs). It's a shame he couldn't be persuaded to stay as a player/coach with an emphasis on the coaching because he would just be an incredible person to have in the dressing room and around the kids and who knows future manager in the making but he obviously feels he wants to be playing football more than he would have been doing for us next year.

I have very little social life, and the amount of perseverance you need in order to get shit done can be seriously overwhelming at times. Time management is *essential*, especially as you head towards exam time in June. Most OU students seem to think I'm an insane masochist when I tell them I'm doing it full time, and I fully admit it does feel quite like that when I lose another Saturday to my books and assessments. I'm almost thirty and well past the weekend bar hopping point however, so missing out on nights out with friends doesn't hugely bother me. I also have a set goal in mind (teaching) that I am using this degree for, so I am determined to put in all the work it needs to get it done. 

Honestly, as you're 21, I would say take advantage of your lack of Scottish tuition fees and go to uni properly, or move out and work full time to sustain yourself and do an OU degree part time over six years to get the academic credentials you want.

I went from riding on my CBT to passing my DAS and buying [my first big(ish) bike](http://i.minus.com/iVKTjWQJH92bu.jpg).

Got to ride my first inline four when they provided me with a loaner bike while mine was being fixed up. [Probably not the best representative of the species!](http://i.minus.com/iO8C2u7erKabo.JPG) As soon as I got my own bike back I headed off on my first [solo tour](http://www.reddit.com/r/MotoUK/comments/2nrqv8/autumn_touring_through_lancashire_and_yorkshire/), which took me through Lancashire/Yorkshire in October.

Finally, I met a brilliant man at MCL. With him I tried [off-roading for the first time](http://i.minus.com/ibxwpNSfb1mzVp.jpg) - in Wales in December. It was excellent.

Finance options include lease type options for convenience (Returning the vehicle at the end of the contract, for example). But the finance is in effect a loan secured against the car; as long as you make payments on time, then the seller has no right to the vehicle and at the end of the contract, if you have the money, they're obliged to take payment as you've settled the debt - they have no right to demand the vehicle instead of the payment. 

On a lease contract, as soon as the contract expires, you have no right to the vehicle. If it comes with a stipulation that you can purchase at the end, this is entirely at the lease holders discretion; they do not have to give you it and can refuse. 

TL;DR: With finance you own the car from day 1, and assuming you make payments and don't violate your finance agreement, that cannot change.

The Junta was extremely concerned about this as a major justification for the coup was to return Argentina to its former glory as one of the world's most powerful economies as it had been at the turn of the century.   Whatever little legitimacy it had with the general populous hinged on the fact it had the support of the industrialists and economic elite of the country and that they were working to reform the country to recapture it's former economic dynamism.   It was becoming evident the opposite was occurring and the Junta saw that an economic meltdown would lead to widespread revolt and a full on civil war.   

The plan was simple and clever.   It hinged on the fact that the United Kingdom was also in the midst of a period of great social and economic turmoil, and counted that the government would not have the will to engage in an armed conflict over an unimportant archipelago in the middle of nowhere.   However it didn't help that General Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri, president and head if the Junta at the moment,  was an complete and total buffoon,  a fall down drunk,  and arrogant to a catastrophic fault.   The complete mismanagement,  lack of foresight (like not considering that Chile would help the English,  despite the fact they had been at war with them only a couple of years prior), and complete level of unpreparedness that Argentina had in the war are all testaments of the ineptitude of The Junta and Galtieri.

The former is financially a much better situation for a government and for most people in this country. I'd rather pay for a ticket knowing the service is being run sustainably while also still returning money to the state rather than into Brian Souter's or Richard Branson's bank account or into the accounts of foreign state-owned train operators like DB or SNCF.

Any new train is expensive. Delays can happen whoever is ordering the trains. It's the private sector ROSCOs paying for them anyway. When trains are ordered by train operators acting as if it's private firm (like Eurostar) they still don't get their trains delivered on time (Siemens haven't delivered). Likewise when Virgin Trains ordered their pendolinos they sued Alstom because the trains were over a year late. Meanwhile TfL, a public sector organisation, is getting its S stock trains delivered on time and on budget.

The fact that a government or government organisation is leading a process doesn't make it more susceptible to delays or higher prices.

I wouldn't normally have used them, but they had an excellent price (after rebate only if bought in store) on a very satisfactory laptop, and it was in in-stock at the local CPW just round the corner, so I reserved it for store collection.

When I arrived, I was told that they didn't have any stock, and that it was a mistake, but that the CPW in the next town did have it in stock, and they reserved it for me from within the store on their computer system.

I went to the other store to pick it up. In this one, it also was out of stock. The sales assistant was very apologetic, and promised to order it in to the store so that it would be ready to pick up the next day. Then, there started the hard sell. ""You look like a professional. This is a business purchase, isn't it?"" 

I told him it was a personal purchase. He persisted. In the end, I had to tell him it was a personal purchase 4 separate times, before he appeared to get the message.

He then went to the store's internal system, and ordered the laptop. When it came to the end, the laptop was £12 more than the in-store price. I paid, and got a till receipt (which just said ""invoice payment"" - not laptop, or anything else). I was told it would be ready the next day.

Called the store the next evening. They couldn't trace any order. I was even told that they don't order goods for in-store collection. I gave the till receipt number and order number. No trace of the order.

Another 2 days pass and there is no sign of the laptop. In the end I visit the store. They have no idea what is going on. They can't trace the order. They ""don't offer in-store collection"". I show them the receipt and they can't trace it. I then wait about 1 hour while they search the store rooms. They can't find it. In the end, they find it left in a pile of boxes at the back of the shop - not even in a locked store room.

It turns out that the order had been put through as a business order. It had been ordered for Mr S User, Sole Trader, Unit 123, Craptown Retail Park. 

I was a bit annoyed as it caused a lot of stress not knowing what had happened to my expensive laptop. It also delayed me picking it up and resulting in several wasted journeys and a lot of time in store.  However, I was more cross because I specifically didn't want the restrictive business T&amp;C. I was especially cross at the fictitious business they created for me, in order to get the sale.

Perhaps you're right about Parecon, I can't say I know enough to judge. But my point was that there are ways to organise resources in society without markets, I can't say I know exactly how yet but we managed it for thousands of years and we can sure as hell try again.

&gt;forcing such a lifestyle down peoples throats always ends in tears.

If you examine economic history, you'll see that the market was forced down the throat of society in the first place. But all the same, I'm arguing that we should create alternative forms of organisation than simply leave the market unnecessary - not use force to try and abolish it.

&gt;I'll take that over ""electing delegates"" any day. Because those delegates will eventually need to be given the power to trample over someone's rights (maybe them damn proprietarians!) and then you're right back to politics like we have today.

Delegates must be distinguished from representatives, like we currently have. Delegates merely convey the opinions of those who elected them, rather than speaking for them. They are immediately recallable and ideally will volunteer to serve for a brief period of time, rather than professionally. All the same, I'd rather that we have direct democracy with no delegates. 

Sometimes in society the rights of some must be trampled upon. I'd rather not have that as the case but we don't live in a utopia, and I'm not trying to create one. 

&gt;I understand that free markets and capitalism are two separate things. They seem to go hand in hand though, or at least work well together.

They do, which is why I'd like to abolish both ;)

But despite that - capitalism has horrible flaws which mean it will continue to exploit, oppress and dominate the working class of the world until its abolition.

That's one thing foreign fans/fans from other cities won't be able to feel, sure they can love the club and the man, sure they will be hurting as well and rightly so, but as a scouser it hurts just a bit more because not only was he this top top player, he was also a local lad.

I remember the first time I got to go to Anfield, it was July 13th 2005 and it was given to me as an early birthday present and we were facing Total Network Solutions in the Champions League First Qualifying Round and whilst sure they were a little shitty team from Wales and we were the Champions of Europe, Steven Gerrard looked like an absolute beast  who nobody could stop and scored a hat trick and I knew I loved that man even though that whole almost joining Chelsea shit happened.

I have always been disappointed I wasn't alive to see many of the greats of Liverpool such as Dalglish, Souness, Keegan, Barnes, Rush, etc. But I'm so glad I got to see Steven Gerrard in his prime, playing for mine and his local team and enjoying the success which came and being devastated by the lows as well.

I can't even count how many memories this man has given me, Olympiacos was the first time I went fucking mental when a ball hit the back of the net, when he scored that goal vs Milan and lifted his arms in a 'let's fucking do this' manner and gave me hope when their was none. The goal in the dying ambers of the 2006 FA Cup Final to take it to extra time, I mean the man single handedly denied Alan Pardew the pleasure of winning a trophy, he'd be a legend for that in its self and so many others including the Basel game recently even though that didn't go to plan.

Over the past 12 months we've been lucky enough to see 3 of the worlds greatest ever footballers play on the Anfield pitch, two for us and the other against, but their are only two men who are on a level of their own who can say they've ever stepped on that pitch wearing the mighty red of Liverpool and not only be the man on the pitch, but also of it as well, for ages Kenny was the only man up their but now Stevie joins him. And I could think of anyone better to do so.

Thanks for all the memories Stevie.

3 of the people on the list are now charged pedophiles. 

You have to remember this is a time where Sir Peter Hayman, a senior diplomat, was a known paedophile and member of the ""Paedophile Information Exchange"" or ""PIE"" a pro-paedophile activist group.

When police raided his Bayswater flat, used to conduct obscene correspondence, they found 45 diaries describing sexual fantasies concerning children and activities with prostitutes.
Seven men and two women, including Hayman, were named as possible defendants in a report submitted by the Metropolitan Police to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

When Geoffrey Dickens tried to get Peter Hayman prosecuted, Sir Michael Havers (now Lord Havers) said he was against the idea, saying in writing;


&gt;“Although Sir Peter Hayman had subscribed to PIE, that is not an offence and there is no evidence that he was ever involved in the management.”

There was a lot of stink in the press about that and the SNP Govt. got critcised for it by the usual labour-backing media...

All of whom neglected to mention legally they couldn't nationalise it (and won't be able to unless westminster hands over that power), and that they had to therefore pick the best commercial operator.

Personally I'd rather the profits, if it can't be nationalised, at least go to improving SOMEONE's rail services if they can't go to ours...better the dutch rail system than some private company's bank account.

... And you're the one who brought up criminal damage? What does that have to do with anything? I guess you could argue that the regulation of serotonin and dopamine releasing drugs such as ecstasy and marijuana could decrease alcohol consumption, therefore reducing criminal damage? It's irrelevant. 

&gt; The risk of dangerous drugs, and also of going to prison is a sufficient disincentive for most people.

Given that 'most people' drink alcohol, which is far more dangerous than most illegal drugs, that is definitely not the case.   Most of the risks associated with taking drugs are due to them being cut by dealers, a factor removed with regulation. 

Again, the risk of going to prison is a problem only associated with prohibition. Treating addicts as criminals not only ruins their job prospects, but is expensive to the tax payer.

That doesn't mean that the event should be off-limits to comedy, I've laughed at plenty of good potato famine jokes in my time (and rolled my eyes at substantially more lame ones), but the jokes have to be told in a knowing way. It's hard to imagine that a foreigner would be able to properly capture the Irish mentality and strike the right balance between humour, respect, and horror. Such a premise could easily descend into unintended offensiveness.

But I don't see any need to be offended at the moment, especially considering the fact that the writer of the show is Irish. I'm unconvinced that the famine will prove to be fertile ground for a comedy series, and there's every chance that the show will be trash that cynically uses its setting to attract attention, but there's no point in getting up in arms about a program that hasn't even been made yet.

null,false,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),null,"&gt;Thinking of moving to a different part of the UK, probably Scotland, and was wondering how much money I should bring with me?

Generally when moving, as much as possible! In your situation, I would bring enough for 3 months rent, utilities, food, and the fare back home incase it goes sour.

There is a slight problem in your plan, and that is where you are going to stay. The Jobcentre will want somewhere they can forward mail to notify you of all the sanctions you'll be getting. I'm not entirely sure, but I doubt they'll be overly happy with your NI address.

But how are you going to get somewhere to stay without proof of income? Some Letting Agents will let you get by with perhaps a guarantor or a massive deposit, but if you have neither of these then perhaps you are up shit creek? Although you might get lucky by talking to landlords directly I suppose (Gumtree et al). Very few accept those on 'DHS' (benefits) however.

Do you know anyone where you will be going? Perhaps you can try Couchsurfing for awhile? Or perhaps you can afford a hotel or hostel for a bit?

But ultimately, this is entirely the wrong way to go about it. You should secure the job before leaving permanently ideally! What type of work are you skilled in? If you're not really skilled in anything, here is what I would do in your situation (no couchsurfing);

1. Look up airbnb/hostel prices in say, Glasgow (~£15 a day).
2. Presume I will need to stay there 4 weeks. (£420). Live frugally (£80 per month for food / drink).
3. Get over to Glasgow.

Gladys Street: fucking fantastic if we're doing well. Everyone in here seems to believe if we cross the halfway line with the ball, it's going in the fucking goal.

Main stand: pretty shit atmosphere, but I there's a lot kids here. It's also pretty steeped, so you lose that 'someone behind you is screaming vibe'. Not too many singers, and not too many conversations in my opinion. Good view, but you almost feel too far away to communicate.

Park end: it's okay! The get involved in chants if they're circulating but it's very family orientated so it's a bit flaccid. A lot of taking about the team, but feels a bit pointless.

Bullens Road: I've had some of the best conversations about Everton in this stand. Fantastic if you're a regular, terrible if you're a newbie. Great view, if you can the tickets

1) Kane picked the ball up on the left and cut inside  
2) This one came from Chadli coming down the right  
3) Kane won the penalty after an errant pass from the left  
4) Chadli drove down the left wing and slid it in to Kane  
5) Kane drove down the left wing and passed it to Chadli who shot from the left edge of the box  
Townsend wasn't involved in any of those if I'm remembering correctly plus only one came from his side of the pitch, and goals aren't everything but he didn't do much else of note either.",null,0,null,1420254767,null,0,false,0,cncsivk,null,t3_2r5mgf,null,t1_cncsivk,null,t1_cncp2dw,null,null,null,1425089764,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

""Of course, UKIP’s full 2015 manifesto is yet to be published. We’ll know more when it comes out, but the signs aren’t encouraging thus far. With complete about-turns on previous pledges, increased complexity in the tax system, new levies on business, as well as flirtations with protectionism and unpleasant envy taxes, their economic policy is in a troubling state.

Foggy, deniable language might work on TV, but not if you seek to be a “kingmaker” in Government. None of us can afford for someone to play games with the British economy.""

null,false,agentdcf,flair8,,null,"I'll reply to your other post to me here as well, since we're sort of having parallel conversations. I didn't realize that Paulinho had scored 6 in 30 matches last year. That's respectable. Thinking about it more, I suppose he did play a big role in AVB's half of the season which was statistically speaking a lot better than it was given credit for. So, okay, Paulinho is probably a bit under-rated by Spurs fans.

What is demonstrably false, though, is the claim that he's playing more and more. Check out the data [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2ohb09/is_fatigue_an_issue_raw_numbers_of_minutes_played/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/2r2qln/fatigue_revisited_minutes_played_in_the_last/), both posts I made compiling the minutes played in recent runs of fixtures. In the first post, the data covers the four matches up to and including Palace on 6 Dec (Partizan, Everton, Chelsea, Palace). In those four matches, Paulinho played 87, 10, 33, and 25 minutes, for a total of 155. That was a run in which Pochettino did not rotate very much, and just twelve outfield players accounted for nearly 90% of the total minutes played. So, he was one of the guys putting in substantial time, even if he did play less than half the total. 

In the seven matches since then, he played 70 minutes against Besiktas (11 Dec, immediately following Palace), and then saw just six minutes against Leicester on Boxing Day before the 24 minutes against Chelsea. Moreover, that was a period when, during a schedule as dense as any club in Europe, Pochettino was actually increasing his rotation, so that for the first four matches of that seven, 13 players accounted for 83% of minutes played, and in the next three 13 players accounted for 91%. So, even while more players were featuring in the team, Paulinho hardly got off the bench. He is most definitely not playing more and more, and thus I find it hard to believe that Pochettino has a whole lot of trust in him. At least, the one piece of evidence for that--his appearance at an admittedly critical moment in an important match--stands next to contrary evidence in the many matches that Paulinho did not play at all. 

Now, I'm not saying that Pochettino hates him or that he's shit or any of that. I've been underwhelmed by him in his time with us, but that doesn't mean that he couldn't be a very effective player in the right circumstances. And, I'm happy to believe that Pochettino may be starting to see things he likes and may fully intend to keep him on as a useful contributor. I just don't see a lot of convincing evidence for that yet. I guess it's most accurate to just note that Paulinho's future at Spurs is an open question.",null,0,null,1420258723,null,0,false,0,cncudu4,null,t3_2r4zmr,null,t1_cncudu4,null,t1_cnckzb6,null,null,null,1425088896,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

&gt;I'm not trying to be facetious but what is your main gripe?

Do you honestly think the British public could give a fuck about a programme that display's the famine as poignant? It just feels like C4 cashing in on the misery of 2 million people. Not to mention the loyalists in NI who I'm sure have been waiting for a comedy about the famine. 

We've never seen comedies from the point of view Jews in concentration camps because we know it would be too contentious to air and just plain disturbing.  

&gt;Would you feel different if it was being written for RTE or do you think the subject should never be covered by comedy?

Yes but I know RTE would never create content like that because no Irish person wants to see such a harrowing time in Irish history turned into a comedy.

I was most worried about him being shackled and therefore killing our creativity.  And in a sense, Matic did shackle Eriksen pretty well, because he wasn't directly involved in any of the goals.

However, what I wasn't expecting was our other players to rise up and do the damage they did.  Eriksen is such a smart player, but it's rare for us that players around him profit from just how good he is (notice how many goals he has this season compared to assists... we haven't had the players to take advantage of his play despite him creating stacks of opportunities).

At last with this game we finally saw the team's attack come of age.  We pretty much did to Chelsea what Chelsea generally do to other teams - that is, flood forward in numbers, get your attacking band of three players between the lines to create havoc, swap positions lots in order to drag defenders around the pitch, and generally be fast and clinical in attacking transitions.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top 1,000 words are included under the third image.

We have semi-official groups. We have victims' groups for republicans, for loyalists, for relatives of security forces, for specific major incidents. We have self-appointed, untrained, but not unpaid, victims counsellors. We have groups demanding inquiries into particular incidents, others into the behaviour of whole groups of state forces. We have a victims' minister and a victims' commissioner.

Here, the country accepts immigrants at a very high rate, but is able to integrate them by spending money in things like free english classes for permanent residents. They even gave me a pass to enjoy most of Canada's attractions for free for a year after becoming a Canadian citizen. The result is clear: a booming economy with immigrants that want to call themselves Canadian and integrate to the Canadian society.

When you use immigration the right way the ""they are taking our jobs"" argument doesn't work, although it's hard to explain why. While you may be competing head-to-head with a newcomer for a specific job, that job may not have even existed if it wasn't for immigrants coming in and creating more jobs with the money they bring, the jobs they take, and the businesses they build.

* Your Facebook page says: ""26th December: After The last kick starter wasn't a success we have started a new one"" - If your last one didn't work, what's changed since then? 

* Your Kickstarter page says: ""if we are being honest we think 250 seated is very small"" - If you're confident about it being so popular, why do you need to raise a measley £1,000? That's a pretty small sum, compared to what you'd get in entry fees and the like. If it was £10,000, sure, I could understand running a Kickstarter, but £1,000 is chump change for what is supposedly an event that will attract more than 250 people. To put it another way, if you can't convince 10 close friends/family to put up £100 each for this part of the event, there's even less chance of a stranger giving you money.

* Your Kickstarter page says: ""There are no risks involved with this project"" - This is always a warning sign. There are ALWAYS risks. I think you've put no risks because this part of the event is just for the server, but if I'm giving you money for the server and the event fails, that's still a waste of money. You need to rethink that section.

* You need better rewards. For £25, I get a tshirt. Tshirts just aren't good enough as a reward. Scrap the tshirt idea and go with something more personable to the event. Some reward ideas (low and high level pledges): Stickers (NOT of your branding - something gaming-related (that doesn't infringe on anyone's IP)), branded ""Supporter"" lanyard - for special treatment at the event (like queue jumping), drinks with the organisers, complimentary drinks/snacks. These things make a supporter feel special. A tshirt with your logo on doesn't.

* You need some better branding. Your logo looks like a knockoff Vodafone. It's just not suited to a gaming event at all. Marketing the event is as important as the event itself and currently both the logo and the website aren't up to scratch. They do nothing to entice me to pledge nor sign up to the event.

Please consider cancelling your Kickstarter and addressing these points and only then start it again.

Schurrle has been more selfish recently but he looks like he just wants to prove himself because he won't get a fucking run even when Willian is god awful going forward and costs us points because he can't create. People seemingly look at Willian's work rate and ignore everything else, but I sure don't know what people are seeing offensively. Tell me what exactly he brings to our team going forward? I'm tired of overly defensive fans saying vague bullshit with no substance like, ""Oh Willian brings a lot of the team and he looks like he just fits in more!"" Every time somebody asks what he brings, people only bring up his defense and nothing else. 

Willian can't shoot. His shots are either on ground with no power and straight to the keeper or saying way above the crossbar. He can't cross. Can't tell how much times I've seen a cross go straight into a defender or goes behind the recipient, slowing the counter. He's way too conservative with the ball. As soon as he gets to a defender, he doesn't dribble past them or try to make an aggressive pass. He always passes it backwards/sideways to Matic or whatever midfielder is next to him. Even Matic tries to dribble past players occasionally. Willian looks like he's afraid of the defenders taking the ball away. 

At least Schurrle can shoot well and pass decently. He always makes runs unlike Willian who never seems to get into the right positions to either score goals or create space. Can't tell you the amount of time he just stands next to Costa and congests the middle. Willian doesn't score that goal against Burnley or the City away goal because he doesn't make those type of runs. He's not as good defensively, but he still tracks back a ton.

Because he's played a fraction of the minutes Willian has due to illness and being in bad form? Hard to expect Schurrle to have just as good chemistry.

null,false,oldcat,falkirk,,null,"&gt;you have more chance of being raped by someone who has never been convicted of a crime than someone who has commited rape in the past. Stastically speaking Ched isnt a threat.

You confuse your statistic, it isn't someone who has committed a rape, it's someone who has been convicted of rape. You also look at the start in a weird way, the chance of me being raped by Ched Evans is obviously miniscule but the chance of Ched Evans raping again is quite high. A study in 1994 found 25% of sexual offenders went on to commit another crime and 15% of them committed a sexual offence. That makes Ched relatively likely to rape again. Given he still believes fucking someone who is unconscious without prior permission is cool I'd guess it's more likely than someone who understands what they did was wrong but even at 15% I'd call that relatively high. (If we look further down to a study of just rapists, smaller sample size, the rate is 28%). 

You also ignore conviction rates for rape which are low due to the evidence frequently being one person's word against another. Given this number of false negatives the numbers who commit rape will be higher than the conviction stats. There are little bits on this in my source but not for rape so I don't have numbers. 

From a more personal stand point, Ched Evans deserves to be able to work, earn and eat. He does not deserve his job of choice. When an MP is convicted of a crime do you insist they get their job back? Clubs are communities and that community has every right to say no to someone they don't think would be a positive part of that. I would say no to him at my club because he willfully refuses to understand what consent is. I don't want that near my club. 

Besides, his only offer is from Malta, he's clearly shite.

My girlfriend wanted to buy a new laptop after Christmas and we had read the other thread when it was first posted and were pretty shocked by it all. However, after looking around local businesses and alternatives, PC World was the only place nearby that had the one she wanted  (HP Pavillion). We popped down there and agreed that if they try and screw us over we'll just walk out. 

We wrangled a staff member and they told us they had the Pavilions in stock and he walked us over to them. Despite being heavily advertised on TV and all around the store as £399, he took us to a pile of them on the shop's floor near the entrance which had either a £80 or £90 markup, I forget which. He instantly went into a ramble about how the pre-set up ones came with a recovery USB as well as McAfee security and cloud storage. When I told him I wasn't interested and that I could set up the recovery drive myself with my own USB stick, he kept saying that you could ""only do the set up one time"" and this was easier. He literally didn't make it seem like this was optional and implied that without the pre-set up option I wouldn't even be able to make a recovery drive (I'd already seen this young sales assistant make a tit of himself doing the same thing trying to explain to a elderly couple what Steam was and why some laptops didn't come with a DVD drive).

Anyway, when I said I'd only be interested in the advertised £399 price he went over to the sales area to check if they did have any which weren't pre-setup. Lo and behold there was a big fuckoff stack of them and we had to wait in a queue to have a sit down with ANOTHER staff member at the checkout who tried the same thing with us. Thankfully, this guy did drop it pretty much immediately when I said I'd already been told about the deal and I wasn't interested, but his colleague behind me had managed to wrangle a family into taking it out on there new laptop. She even went through a bit of a song and dance saying ""I'll just check if we have any pre-set up units"" despite there being about a hundred on the other side of the partition.

I suspect it's ""very popular with customers"" because they manage to fool many people with this awful bait and switch. It felt like a timeshare presentation when we had to sit down with the second sales assistant at the checkout area (incidentally this wasn't at the normal check out line, it was a small open office near it - obviously only for products where they can add on the Know How extras). We were surprised it was so much more than the original £35 posted in the other thread, which doesn't seem as bad in comparison. This was a big PC World on an industrial estate (Aintree in Liverpool) so maybe they try their luck more than the smaller stores? I can't even imagine the amount of people they must have managed to sell the more expensive units to by making out that they only had the pre-set up ones in stock.

* 1764: France arrives to the islands
* 1766: Britain arrives to the islands
* 1766: France gives rights of the land to spain (they also renamed the port to ""puerto soledad"")
* 1774: Britain leaves the islands voluntarily because of economic reasons of the time (I think it was related to the american independance, but I'm not sure)
* 1811: Spain also leaves the island, only leaving some ""gauchos and fisherman who stayed voluntarily""
* 1820: Argentina sent Luis Vernet to explore the area and try to gather resources to start a settlement.
* 1829: Bernet was named military and civil commander of the islands. Tried to regulate seal fishing in the area by USA and was confronted with resistance because his authority was not recognized.
* 1832: A mutin happens, which apparently destroys or seriously hinders any control of the argentine over the islands. After this happened the british returned to the islands (after 59 years) to reassert their claim. The argentine stood no chance against them, and could not resist the change of the argentine flag for a british one. They later left the island , they were allowed to stay, but under british sovereignty. 

Argentine goverment of the time protested immediately about british actions, but could do nothing about it, and we've basically tried to take them back since then. So the islands were from either spain or britain,  This is the part in dispute, as both countries had claims and battled each other about it, with some documents helping one side and some helping the other one. After the spain right's to the land were given to argentina we tried to explore and use the islands, but were taken out by britain.

The part to discuss is who it belonged to when the british came to them in 1832, because it's the difference between defending your land and invading it. This could go either way, as most of the details are lost to time.

For example it is not known if britain knew the french were even there when they claimed the land, maybe the french settlement was so insignificant it did not matter, maybe they just decided to ignore them.

But no, you can't because of the eviiiillll conspiracy of climate scientists which ignores all the oh-so-brave denialist papers. It's not at all (And I'd like you to picture my voice dripping with condescension and sarcasm here, because it is)  that the denialist ""papers"" get taken apart, disproved, debunked and demonstrably proved wrong. 

Tinfoil hat much? You sound like every other crank: established science  won't give your scrap a fair hearing. Aye *right*. As I alluded to earlier, if there's a field where a startling new iconoclastic discovery really could be successful it's thus one because there's tonnes of money and political clout ready to stand behind you if you actually gave something ... but you don't. 

Lets look at all these climate scientists whose hard wire and expertise you denigrate. You have a pretty shabby view of their morality and ethics so explain this to me: why don't they jump sides to where the money is? You've got to admit the Koch brothers and other fossil fuel interests can pay orders of magnitude more than government grants. Why don't they? Could it be the facts actually point opposite way to what you want them to? 

Have to admit I've not seen ""wait and see"" out of a denialist for a while. That was mostly the line along with ""not enough study"" about a decade or two ago. They got followed up with ""let's wait and see a bit longer"" and ""even more study is needed"" (while hypocritically trying to choke off funding for study - nice touch). 

I thought after the weight of data started to make those tactics laughable you guys moved onto ""well ok it *is* happening but it would be too expensive to fix"" or ""well it's too late to fix it now"" and even ""it could be a good thing"".

CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.

CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

CJ383 Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. More supported accommodation should be provided for women on release to break the cycle of repeat offending and custody.

I think I probably agree with the thrust of the idea that there isn't enough focus on rehabilitation, but I'm not sure whether it should be *so* focussed on just the one sex, and I definitely don't think their should difference in sentencing for different people if the crime is the same.

No, the bazaar and agora are two of the oldest and most universal cultural practices in humanity. The only way you're going to be able to prove your point is by spouting theories about pre-history. Mankind became 10x more economically free when we picked one or two commodities to represent prices, and started exchanging our hides, flints, mushrooms, wheat wool and veggies in bazaars.

&gt;But despite that - capitalism has horrible flaws which mean it will continue to exploit, oppress and dominate the working class of the world until its abolition. If rescuing the population of this planet means sacrificing the efficiency of the market then I'd do it in a second.

Erm we've never had capitalism in any form. We've had state-controlled markets. Which is basically the monkeys of this world trying to exploit hardworking craftspeople and businesspeople using legal forms of theft, rape and murder. Tell me how that is related to capitalism, if we agree that capitalism is owning oneself and one's affect and not trampling on that ownership through theft and taxation.

It's never been tried. We've always let the leeches (i.e. the political class and their crony, lazy, regulatory ""businesses"" and ""corporations"" which are actually anti-competition and anti-business) in our society have an opportunity to ruin the entire experience for everyone.

Arguably, if the technology and powers got better, they wouldn't need to use a wider net to catch everything as they'd be able to filter ""interesting"" things more easily.

It's absolutely inevitable that GCHQ, police, border patrol and everybody else is going to be more online. The whole world is online now - from our hobbies, financial transactions, crimes and everything else, including actual attacks with financial consequences (demonstrated by Sony, or North Korean hacks on Japan and S.Korea who have suffered losses to the tune of $100Ms). In my opinion, more and more attacks will be carried out in that way, and it's sensible (and inevitable) that UK security agencies will have to combat it.

It's simply impossible to try and deny those powers to the authorities. I don't want my privacy to be invaded but I really don't believe they care about my dick pics, my Facebook or my email content. I *would* however be extremely angry if my identity was stolen, or my bank account drained, or my details stolen from a company, or services I depend on were hacked.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"Indeed. However, there are some very clear differences, I think.

First off, I think the idea of a footballer's 'boyhood club' is often overrated, however, when a player reaches a certain point in one's career, I think the idea of 'home' becomes much more important.

For example, if you follow basketball in America, LeBron James ultimately went back home to Cleveland. To a lesser extent, the 32-year-old Rickie Lambert is at the sunset of his career and jumped at the chance to return to his own boyhood club.

Frank Lampard is a fantastic player, however, it is hard to say that Chelsea was his boyhood club - especially considering his family history (i.e. his father played for West Ham for a very long time) - even though I'm sure that he respects and is very loyal to Chelsea for all that they have done for him.

Now you take a person like Steven Gerrard who was born on Merseyside. He quite literally has the city of Liverpool in his blood; Has friends, family who have Liverpool in their blood (whether they were Everton or LFC). He had the very unique opportunity to only grow up in the Liverpool region but ultimately sign a professional contract with Liverpool FC, work up through the ranks, make the first team, and not just play football but become a legend for club and country.

There were times that Gerrard and the ugly business of football didn't see eye-to-eye but, thankfully, the club showed loyalty to Gerrard and Gerrard showed loyalty to the club.

Flash forward to 34-year-old Steven Gerrard at the tail-end of his career. At this point, I think a man like Gerrard considers much more than just money or trophies or glory. I think at this point a man like Gerrard takes into consideration his *legacy* and I think Gerrard does not want to tarnish that legacy by playing for another club or even another club in Europe.

Steven Gerrard is in an incredibly unique position to state that he was able to play for his boyhood, become a legend at his boyhood club, represent LFC as captain of England and *never* play for another English or European club other than LFC.

That is his legacy.

Five, ten, fifteen years after Gerrard hangs up his boots and we start to talk about legends and we start to split hairs about who is a legend and *why* he is a legend, I think many will point to Gerrard and say, 'Well, he never played for another English or European club other than Liverpool.'

I think that will matter to supporters; I think that will matter to Steven Gerrard.

I'm not naive about the business of football, though. Sure, Lampard said the same thing about Chelsea. Gerrard could turn around and shock us all by staying in England.

But... my gut says that Gerrard will honor his words. He will ride off into the sunset of the MLS in America, do well, hang up the boots for good and come home to Liverpool untarnished.",null,0,null,1420281951,null,0,false,0,cnd1qmu,null,t3_2r4vdt,null,t1_cnd1qmu,null,t1_cncpxap,null,null,null,1425085394,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

Again, I point out that _I_ would have to be insane to do this.  You can put your sarcasm in as much as you want, it doesn't make it untrue.  For the record, I don't believe they are evil.  I don't even believe, for the most part they are being consciously deceptive.  I believe they are falling prey to the problem that we have developed the scientific method to combat: ourselves.

&gt; It's not at all (And I'd like you to picture my voice dripping with condescension and sarcasm here, because it is) that the denialist ""papers"" get taken apart, disproved, debunked and demonstrably proved wrong.

Where are these denialist papers being published that they are subsequently debunked?  There are a solid set of ""deniers"" (which incidentally is fairly offensive) who don't get papers published.

 - Steve Mcyintyre
 - Judith Curry
 - Freeman Dysan
 - Richard Lindzen
 - Roy Spencer

All spring to mind -- these are all respectable people.  Where is the debunking of _their_ papers?  When you talk about debunking, you will be talking about the debunking of papers that are by the loonies (and loonies exist in all fields).  They are an easy target, and I'd likely agree with the debunking.  When UKIP politicians speak out about it for example, they sound like idiots -- but that proves nothing other than they are idiots.

&gt; You sound like every other crank: established science won't give your scrap a fair hearing.

As I said, _I_ have no scrap.  I've got a job that pays, and would be insane to give that up to be a climate scientist who doesn't get papers published.

&gt; As I alluded to earlier, if there's a field where a startling new iconoclastic discovery really could be successful it's thus one because there's tonnes of money and political clout ready to stand behind you

&gt; Lets look at all these climate scientists whose hard wire and expertise you denigrate. You have a pretty shabby view of their morality and ethics so explain this to me: why don't they jump sides to where the money is?

They already have.  The ""money"" is firmly, unbelievably held by the catastrophic climate change side.  Why do you think so many of the skeptical side are ""amateurs""?  That it's being done by bloggers, and scientists from other fields who are retired or do it in their spare time?  Why hasn't this money you talk about flooded to them?

Big Green has spent, and will have spent on it, hundreds of billions.  Big Oil is also Big Green; and the more subsidies we get for industrial green projects, the more those Big Oil companies will create or buy up the companies receiving those subsidies.

&gt; Have to admit I've not seen ""wait and see"" out of a denialist for a while.

I'm on that because I got fed up of threads like this.  Why do you care what I think anyway?  Besides, ""wait and see"" isn't just ""well things are going to change... _then_ I'll be right"".  The world hasn't met _any_ of the predictions of the climate scientists, so it's _them_ who are now on ""wait and see"" not me.  The current stance is that ""the last 18 years of (unpredicted) cooling, are just a temporary state of affairs -- that we are storing up future trouble... just you deniers wait and see.""

The problem of course is that it's the catastrophic climate side that needs to have the money and the faith, because they are the ones with the extraordinary claims.

I'm done now, because this is how all these threads go -- I get massively down voted and told I'm an idiot (which is fine, I couldn't care less) and that I personally am responsible for coming up with the evidence to convince every climate scientist to give up their career and funding.  To end though, here's some random links and statements that make up evidence that convinces me (I don't hold any illusion that it will convince you, so please don't feel you have to reply, as I certainly won't be):

 - Antarctic sea ice at record high 2014; pretty much [unchanged](https://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2014/12/30/antarctic-sea-ice-same-as-40-years-ago/) over 40 years.
 - World temperature has been dropping for 18 years.  During those 18 years 25% of the CO2 _ever_ emitted by humans has been emitted.  If the resulting warming isn't happening now, then something is wrong with the theory.
 - Hockey stick ... quietly brushed under the carpet now it's been debunked.
 - Tree ring reconstruction of temperature data... quietly brushed under the carpet now it's been debunked.
 - [100 years of failed predictions](http://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/12/05/friday-funny-over-a-centurys-worth-of-failed-eco-climate-quotes-and-disinformation/)
 - [13 ridiculous Earth day predictions from 1970](https://ricochet.com/archives/13-ridiculous-predictions-made-earth-day-1970/)
 - IPCC revises down feedback fraction... again
 - IPCC recognises that the lack of warming needs some explanation, but doesn't provide it.
 - Catastrophic change would require massive positive feedback of CO2 effect.  CO2 has been much higher in the past -- why was positive feedback suspended in the past?  In fact, CO2 concentration today is lower than it has been for most of the world's history.
 - The medieval warm period occurred before industrialisation.  What explanation is there fore _that_ warming and why wouldn't that explanation cover any present or future warming too?
 - All the evidence is that CO2 is correlated with temperature.  Except that it lags temperature not leads it.  That reversal of the usual cause-and-effect ordering requirement needs explaining.
 - CO2 heat absorption is logarithmic in nature -- i.e. ever decreasing as more is added.  It's only getting less significant over time.
 - The portion of radiative heat that CO2 absorption actually has available to absorb is _already_ 97% absorbed by the CO2 in the atmosphere -- that only leaves 3% more that could _possibly_ ever be absorbed.  The [IPCC](http://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/08/10/the-diminishing-influence-of-increasing-carbon-dioxide-on-temperature/) themselves have published charts that acknowledge that.
 - There is no economic case for acting to prevent warming regardless of whether it's happening -- a warmed planet would benefit more than it harmed -- as it has in the past.
 - Even if it were a good idea to try and stop climate change, the [evidence](http://joannenova.com.au/2014/12/the-carbon-tax-figures-are-in-australians-paid-14b-to-reduce-global-emissions-by-0-004/) is that it is economically impossible.  $14 billion for 0.004% of change?  Was it worth it?
 - [Politicised science is bad](http://www.michaelcrichton.net/essay-stateoffear-whypoliticizedscienceisdangerous.html)
 - Computer models are not observation, they are hypothesis.  When tested against reality and are shown wrong then that demonstrates the the hypothesis is wrong, not ""right but give us some time"".
 - Raw thermometer data that other scientists then use as basis for their research are [mostly interpolated, not real](https://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/top-debunker-of-the-year/)
 - James Hansen year's ago offered a ""Scenario C"" as a prediction of global temperature if, miracle of miracles, he got exactly his way and the world managed to achieve ""zero emissions after 2000"".  The [world's temperature](https://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/the-0-01-degree-shell-game/) has kindly been lower than even that most positive of potential outcomes.  Are climate scientists cheering at our good fortune?  No, of course not, because that would reduce the funding for them.

Couple of things you should note, when crossing back into Russia from Kaz you dont need to cut back as far as Pavlodar - &gt; Omsk, There is a good road from Pavlodar directlly to Novosibirsk or Barnaul. 

That bit from Barnaul to the Mongolian border (Russian Altai) is really beautiful, Good Wild Camping. If you want a real off-road challenge from the Western Mongol Border the northern route, rather than going south to Olgii and then cut back up there are paths in the earth that lead to Ulaangom, and a couple of River crossings. Some of the hardest riding but i look back on it as a challenge achieved. 

I dident take the southern stans because at the time it was a real visa headache, I understand that has been relaxed now so that should be cool.

When in Almaty a day trip east towards the Chinese border to Charyn Canyon is good, nice wild camping out in the desert, amazing stars at night.

The only general advice i could give you would be keep weight to a minimum where possible. As the roads give way to nothing you will be glad off a light bike and it will make the off-road portions much more enjoyable.

Source: Office for National Statistics

http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/public-sector-finances/november-2014/sum-public-sector-finances--november-2014.html

The Independent gives the reasoning behind claiming halving the deficit:

&gt; In cash terms, the deficit has only been reduced by about a third.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt; most people understood the word “deficit” to mean the amount, in cash, between what is spent, and what is raised.

&gt; But the Tories claim that the deficit had been halved was based on saying the word “deficit” has another meaning: the ratio of deficit to GDP.

I am aware they have backtracked on previous policies and such but that was the 2010 manifesto, I didn't particularly like a lot of things they put in that manifesto and I hope they'll put a lot more thought into this one, from what they've said I'll trust their new manifesto is a lot closer to the views of the party and I'll make further judgements from there. 

As for backtracking due to being tired, I assume you're referring to the Romanians comment? Farage said that in a very silly way causing it to sound as if he was racist towards Romanians, he said that he meant it in a way that with the amount of crime Romanians cause in the London area, he'd be more worried to live next door to a group of them. I doubt he'd have been openly racist like that, he's a very intelligent man and whether he's racist or not, he wouldn't say something openly racist.

For me personally, I'm more interested in the main policies they're pushing forward right now, leaving the EU is a desirable for me along with a fair few Libertarian values, if UKIP gets any sort of power at this point it will only be a coalition, this means that the vast majority of their policies, like the Lib Dems are unlikely to implemented.

Plus, his lack of integration into the side at the moment can only be hurt by a loan deal.  I think it's pretty clear he hasn't fully clicked with his teammates yet (unlike Chadli, who I think is a technically lesser player, but is making far more of his abilities at the moment), and so the one thing he needs is time to play with them more.  Not to mention he needs to get a clearer idea of his role within Poch's plans for the side.  Going away for a stint and learning how to plan another person's system with other players is not going to help us in the short or long term.",null,0,null,1420287108,null,0,false,0,cnd2nyd,null,t3_2r72i9,null,t1_cnd2nyd,null,t3_2r72i9,null,null,null,1425084964,null,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null
null,false,panda_burgers,null,null,null,"What you're describing is basically [value investing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing). You'll need to decide what makes a good company for you based on the company's fundamentals, but essentially, you're looking for a good dividend yield, which expresses the annual dividend distributed per share.

&gt; Is it even wise to do something like that? Or are there better ways to start investing for someone who has very little to start off.

If you have a lot of money, then this approach can make you money (i.e. be Warren Buffet), but with a small investment capital, you won't be able to diversify much. That's bad, because it means your portfolio is more vulnerable to fluctuations than a larger one made up of more companies.

As an alternative, there are funds that aim to achieve returns through dividend yields. These are large pools of money, managed by someone with a specific aim, and can be used to reduce the risk over buying a small handful of shares.

That said, passive investment is considered the smarter way to do it. Expense ratios for index funds are typically lower than actively managed funds as they don't try to beat the market.

See, there's another thing. You can't always wait for the police or an authority figure to step in and make things right, because by then it could be too late. If someone's breaking down my front door *right now* for some nefarious purpose, I don't have time to wait for the police to maybe respond.

The pistol I typically carry around town (when not hunting) is about 3""×4""×1"". It weighs a couple of pounds... and it weighs more than anything else I ever carry. There's an enormous weight of *responsibility* in choosing to carry a handgun for defense of yourself and others. It means that I now lose any verbal altercation I'm ever in by saying ""okay, man"" and walking away from insults hurled at my back. It means not responding if I'm provoked, spat on, whatever because it's now *illegal* to escalate a situation. I'm now going to turn the other cheek until I'm absolutely sure that you're going to take my life or someone else's. And then I have to accept the potential responsibility of having taken a human life.

That's weightier, also, than you might think. We aren't hardwired to kill each other easily, and I'm not a violent man despite what you might expect of a man who enjoys hunting and shooting. I've been put in two situations where I might have to kill a man, and they both kept me up for weeks afterward-- analyzing, replaying them in my mind, looking for a chance to de-escalate or walk away.

Realizing that you may have to kill a man, that moment of hard truth, is terrifying. I believe that anyone who tells you that it's exhilarating is either a liar or a psychopath. In that moment, any option to walk away or change the course of events is gone. You're just praying that they stop, that they pause before it's too late. You're talking, anything to get them to *stop* before you have to do this terrible thing, this unforgivable, monstrous thing that can never be taken back or amended in all the future turnings of the world. Before you take the life of someone's son, once someone's baby. Your mind feels clouded by the chemical dump even as you're trying to stay sharp, to hunt in such desperation for the right string of words to turn things back. Everything's in overdrive, so much adrenaline that you're shaky and sick. It's the scariest thing I can think of, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

So... I guess folks think that guns are both more and less than what they are. It's a tool, like an extension of your body almost. Just a couple of pounds of steel... and an infinite burden of responsibility.

I suggest you open a complaint (via phone, or email) and then prepare to wait 6 months+ to have it resolved. I had an account with Scottish Power for a short 6 months during which time they billed me random amounts, closed my account (telling me someone else had moved into my address), then re-opened it and billed me an imaginary amount.

I finally moved out (and emigrated). On December 11th they billed me another £91.90 for a house I haven't been in for 4 months. I'm reported them via the Energy Ombudsman (very helpful, recommended) so now I just sit back and wait.

Plagiarism detection software gives a percentage likelihood that the work is plagiarised, and that percentage may affect what happens. The decision is ultimately down to the universities you've applied for.

If it's quite a high percentage, it's probably pretty bad. If it's a fairly low percentage, it could be that you've simply over-relied on stock phrases. If you're applying for creative writing at a competitive university, that indicates a lack of originality, and honestly, it's probably not great either. If you're applying for mathematics at a less prestigious uni on the other hand, it's probably looking a bit better. Some software can also be set off by inconsistent syntax and vocabulary level; if most of your statement demonstrates an intermediate level of English and you've got one amazing sentence, that sentence looks out of place and suspicious (this is certainly something we're warned about on my uni course, but I know not all software checks for it).

A lot of universities publish their policy in these cases on their website, so check there. While I haven't ever seen a plagiarism email from UCAS, I find it highly unlikely they're expecting you to work out what to do for yourself. There are probably some instructions and advice in there. Also contact the teacher who is supervising your application as soon as possible.

In more long term advice, if and when you are accepted to a university, check their plagiarism policy very carefully.

The problem is that too many people think it is good to cut services and benefits to delete a deficit. That there are better, more profitable ways does not occur to many but investment is one of them. Investment in infrastructure including the railways, schools and health. That would be forward-looking and not going backwards.

After all there is an awful amount of money in the UK. How to get at it? Higher taxes for higher earners would be a start (but no one is prepared to suggest that as it does not sound good). Effective measures against tax evaders would be another. Agreement with other EU leaders on stamping out tax avoidance in the EU would be a third. 

These three measures would bring billions to the economy very quickly to improve public services and reduce the deficit.

Where as Seattle averages something like 40k in attendance which is huge for MLS considering the league average over the past 2-3 years has hovered around 19k.  

Portland has a much smaller footprint, but they, along with Seattle, attract a lot of people to their brand, by being the hip options.

To be a little more scientific about it here's /r/MLS [flair breakdown](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/2a3iug/latest_rmls_flair_stats/) as of 6 months ago. 

Or a [map](http://i.imgur.com/nXdHfHp.png) based on where supporters are located. 

To editorialize a little, one of the problems MLS has, as a growing league is that while people may be passionate about their local team. Such as myself, with Metro season tickets. No one really gives a shit about the league as a whole. Which is to say, ""I'll watch every one of my teams games, but I'm not tuning in to see how the Colorado Rapids fair against Real Salt Lake.""

null,false,syntax,null,null,null,"&gt; Plagiarism detection software gives a percentage likelihood that the work is plagiarised,

Not quite - they give it a 'score'; normally out of 100, which describes how similar it is to other materials.

There is no software out there than can detect 'plagiarism', just how similar a particular piece is.  The 'market leader', Turnitin, calls it an 'Originality Report' - and talks a lot about how it can 'reduce plagiarism'.  UCAS use Turnitin for the personal statements (from memory; I don't have the docs to hand).

Plagiarism is a specific thing, that requires intent on the part of the guilty party - and determining that by software is a claim that would be extraordinary [0].

What that really means in this case: UCAS should provide an argued case for why they think it was plagiarised.  I'd write to them, and ask them for that (and emphasise that you did not copy anyone else).  Once you have the detailed argument, you should see why from that, and know where to go.

Specifically, if there's a large number of matches to very small fragments, then one can argue that it's co-incidence - (which it probably is).

In the private sector you earn more (bonuses, pay increases, maybe you have shares in the company, etc - it's all up to you to negotiate when you take a job) when times are good and you earn less when times are bad, so your reward is related to the performance of the private company you're working in (and obviously this is related to the performance of the sector of the economy you're in, etc).

In the public sector you accept a job with a particular wage band and incremental increases (to factor in inflation). When times are good you don't earn as much as you potentially could in the private sector, but your job is more secure and wages remain stable.. you tend to get a competitive pension at the end of it too (keeps you from upping for the private sector with all your experience for one thing). When times are bad then you might even do a bit better than the private sector.. but not by much.

What I see is that the private sector wants to win on both counts - from what you just said.. the private sector doesn't care when it's doing well but as soon as the public sector is looking like it's doing the same/worse.. bring on the cuts - seems a bit unfair to me.

Assuming your younger brother is not an adult, she'd see a 25% reduction in council tax and a third reduction in food bills. I suspect she'd pay the same for TV and internet. Other bills like gas and electric are much more difficult to work out because, for example, heating the living room costs the same no matter how many people are in it. You might be best just dividing those by three for simplicity's sake.

However, that's a starting point for negotiation, not a final calculation. You need to be an adult and discuss the situation with her. She may be embarrassed to discuss her finances with you, but explain that if she wants your help, she'll have to. Also, at 22, you will probably want to move out eventually, so make it abundantly clear that you cannot provide a permanent solution to her money problems. You could also help with things like making sure she's claiming all the benefits she's entitled to and getting the best deal on all her bills.

null,false,ninereeds314,null,null,null,"I don't really know that much about Irish history. I see some curious gaps in the [Wikipedia timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Irish_history) though.

Apparently nothing much happened between 1647 and 1740. Which is odd, considering that right in the middle of that there was a war where Ireland supported the already-deposed catholic King, providing armed forces to help him invade and try to regain the throne. Also no mention of whether the Irish helped during the plague around 1665, or whether they sat the other side of the Irish sea feeling smug that English protestants (and everyone else) were dying en masse.

Of course the Irish Catholics had grievances even then. So did the English and the Protestants. That's history. As in no-one alive now has any responsibility for these events that happened centuries ago. I personally am neither catholic nor protestant nor in any way religious, and have no real idea about my ancestors beyond my grandparents. Maybe some of them were fighting against others in the Battle of the Boyne? Maybe some of them were hiding in Ireland while others were dying of plague. Maybe some of my ancestors were starving in the potato famine while others of my ancestors were able to help but willfully negligent about it. Just because I happened to be born in England doesn't place me on any particular side.

The potato famine was more recent, sure, but it happened more than 120 years before I was born. The second world war is much more recent, and I really don't care if the Germans mock the English war effort. The English mock the English war effort. Denial of the atrocities is a different thing, but the Germans now are no more responsible for the Nazis or the second world war than I am. And the English alive now are no more responsible for the potato famine than you are.

There's a difference between learning the lessons of history and refusing to ever let it go.

I'm not going to try to pedant whether a natural disaster can be called a genocide - huge numbers of people died, though I'm mostly ignorant on the subject AFAICT there was willfull negligence spanning years, pedanting word definitions isn't the point.

But even so, even though I've never mocked the potato famine, I don't see why it would be offensive for the English in particular to mock the famine, yet presumably OK if an Irish person is responsible. After all, 165-170 years later on, maybe I had Irish ancestors back then and maybe you had English ancestors back then. It doesn't matter the slightest to me. You aren't your great great great grandparents.

Regarding your second question, 40%-50% is a very high deposit by UK standards, where 10% mortgages are frequently advertised by banks. I would be surprised if you had trouble getting accepted for a mortgage based on a deposit of that size.

Read up on ISAs, which let you earn interest on £15,000 a year tax-free (the money can be held as cash or in investments, or a mix of the two) and you can withdraw the money at any time. ISAs are similar to Roth IRAs in the US. You will want to max out your ISA allowance each year.

I was trying to save up for stuff like a suit for interviews, driving lessons, deposit and rent on a flat + living expenses for that first month before payday if/when I did get my proper job, but I was constantly having to help my mum out with the mortgage, council tax etc. I don't begrudge her it at all, but it certainly puts a huge strain on the relationship when you're trying to save up to move out and get on with your life, and it seems like she's deliberately trying to hamper your efforts by conveniently being short on cash every time you manage to get that sweet double overtime at work.

Again, there is a vast body of peer-reviewed literature for you to critique at your leisure. The tabloid press may publish some sensationalist stories, but they obviously shouldn't be treated as credible sources. As for the projected economic and social impacts, I wouldn't describe it as hysteria if it is based in fact.

Gas, electricity, Internet, phone, all food shopping for the month and then everything else like meals out together and emergency fund. 

Also make sure there is enough for emergency fund, my mate stayed over and closed the window with force and cracked a pane - £110 having to fork out from nowhere. How? Shared account. 

Also, unfortunately, I struggled getting a job after graduation for a few months, thankfully there was quite a lot of excess in the shared account where I could take from. I DO NOT ADVISE THIS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. Tension over money between partners is hell. But the fact that we had both been putting in £525 a month (thank you, student finance) and having excess left, it was doable but now obviously I am paying it all back. 

So yeah, it might not be ideal for everyone, but that was the best decision my gf and I could have made in order for us to live together while I wasn't working full time and in uni.

Not really, the private sector is still more volatile than public sector.  The issue is, many in the public sector still want to pretend as if change never happens.  Change is disruptive, I completely understand why people think it's bad, but it's efficient and long term it's better.  Imagine if we'd simply banned electronic communication to save postal worker jobs, I swear a nameless department I briefly consulted for had this exactly when it came to filing and similar, they had to keep a staff of 20 to do a job, that would be performed better by a small server or three.

When it comes to the quagmire we find ourselves in, I agree that this is possibly the least opportune moment to cut things, ten years ago, I would have described myself as a Keynesian, but the issue was we'd had terrible miss management, overspending during boom times, rather than saving a little or just even being flat.  We've been splurging as a nation, the same way as consumers, with credit used badly.  Credit can be a brilliant thing, I'd have never been able to build my current company without the money we'd raised, thats ten jobs created so far.  But at the same time credit can be used poorly, such as someone buying a gratuitously expensive TV, that asset is only going to fall in value, and offers little improvement over a model half the price.

As such, I'd argue that the benefit has been received during the 'boom' times disproportionately by many of those in the public sector and those who were benefitting from it.",null,0,null,1420298240,null,0,false,0,cnd5b2q,null,t3_2r707n,null,t1_cnd5b2q,null,t1_cnd3j6k,null,null,null,1425083731,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

---

&gt;Major League Soccer operates under a single-entity structure in which teams and player contracts are centrally owned by the league.    Each team has an investor-operator that is a shareholder in the league.  In order to control costs, MLS shares revenues and holds players contracts instead of players contracting with individual teams. In *[Fraser v. Major League Soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_v._Major_League_Soccer)*, a lawsuit filed in 1996 and decided in 2002, the league won a legal battle with its players in which the court ruled that MLS was a single entity that can lawfully centrally contract for player services.  The court also ruled that even absent their [collective bargaining agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining_agreement), players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.

Yet again I feel compelled to point out that sitting in the House of Commons isn't the sole purpose of an MP nor should it be how we measure their performance.

They do a large amount of casework, committee work and travel back and forward between Westminster, their constituency and even overseas if they are members of particular parliamentary groupings.

I have absolutely no problem with my MP missing a session in the Commons because he is in Whitehall meeting a Minister to discuss a matter on behalf of a constituent, nor have I any problem with them missing several sessions because they are on an overseas delegation to the United States, Brussels or wherever else it is that their Parliamentary work takes them.

Edit: on [transfermarket](http://www.transfermarkt.com/miralem-pjanic/profil/spieler/44162) it says he is worth 27 mill EUR, thats 21-22 m GBP so maybe inflated to 30-35m to buy him.

null,false,TheAnimus,null,null,null,"Think of it this way, let's use the oldest profession.

A lady can 'create' value by having sex with a man.  That man was a farmer, and the only way to motivate him to work that extra hour per day is by the sex he can buy.  That means that the lady of the night created some potatoes, a physical good, by her ability to provide a service.

So whilst she isn't directly creating anything by having sex for money, the system underlying it will.   But this farmer has a problem, he only has money some months of the year, during harvest.  But that's ok, this whore is an economist so understands, she let's the farmer issue an IOU, and services him the rest of the year, for something that will be delivered during the harvest season.

So now not only has she created something that wouldn't otherwise existed (the food) but she has also allowed an issue of a I Owe yoU note.  She has facilitated in the issue of debt.

But the effect to everyone else of this, is that more food will be produced, so food will be cheaper as her actions didn't create more demand (she didn't get knocked up), the farmer is happier, it's a win-win. 

Money is best thought of as a promise for something, people make the mistake of trying to think of it as a tangible substance such as gold.  This means that the promise can change, just as much as it can be completely broken, the goal posts of that promise are constantly moving, prices for things constantly change, it's all floating.  So that isn't very useful, which is why financial services industry exists, they can facilitate people exchanging this floating risk for a fixed risk.  The basis of any trade can be modelled as one or more fix:float exchanges.  Now when the real world is changing, changing for the better, the cost of activities change rapidly.  That lady used to be able to charge a lot of money for her services, but now, there are a bunch of cheaper prostitutes who are on the market, as migration rules have changed.  This can suddenly mean a reduction in her prices, which means the farmer works less hard, as he doesn't need to produce as much food to afford his fuck.  This results in less food available for the general market.  The economist did a piece a while back about the cost of prostitutes around the world, it's pay walled but an interesting read.

Everything is a constantly moving target.  Money is worth less, worth more every day, depending on what you are wanting to exchange it for.

Now in your assertion that the BoE issued more debt, that's not true at all, the BoE did a lot of QE, which results in driving inflation, which effectively deflates debt, and I highly doubt that the debt will be paid off in most peoples life times.  The issue is that we borrow money and spend it on things that are short term benefit.  For instance retired people's health, such as my mother, are a big cost, meanwhile things like crossrail which are a big cost, will benefit some people enough to pay for it directly.  The unfair debt, is one of services that are consumed, but provide no lasting value.  Now if you are wanting to tell me my aged mother shouldn't get her knee surgery funded by you, whilst I see where you might come from, I don't like it.",null,0,null,1420299473,null,0,false,0,cnd5pyf,null,t3_2r707n,null,t1_cnd5pyf,null,t1_cnd3tdn,null,null,null,1425083538,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

* Gas / Elec £48 p/m for both
* Internet £21 p/m
* No council tax due to being students

I paid for everything and then would get the half of everything transferred back to me. It helped to have both people with mobile banking apps, so the transfers were quick ‘n’ easy.

PS: This arrangement was easy, until we broke up. So I'm posting also some lessons learnt:

* Split the costs, of things. Asking for money when you're together is easy, once apart it's not.
* Decide what happens when you break up. Does somebody take over the contract or not? Do we move out or not? Basically there were massive disagreements, and I lost a lot of money on this.
* 50/50 split everything, else you'll get used for your higher contributions towards rent, etc.
* If possible sign the contract not as a joint tenant, but as separate individuals. This means you're not liable for your gf's errors, and vice versa. This also means that each guarantor is not held accountable for the other.

When asked in 2013, Leon Brittan claimed he had  “no recollection of these matters”, but in 2014 issued a statement which admitted he was handed the dossier.

null,false,SpartacusFC,null,null,null,"Doneil Henry is a solid young central defender with huge potential. His raw athletic metrics are considered anomalies for his age range and apart from a few rookie blunders, he has not looked a touch out of place in a starting back line. 

His areas of strength are in his ability to head and clear the ball in 50-50 challenges, even against big forwards like Robbie Keane or Chris Wondolowski. His footwork is very good, too. He has a tremendous confidence and isn't afraid of taking a deft touch to trick onrushing forwards into taking the wrong lane before he passes it over. 

He has a great long pass that can pick out rushing wingers or forwards. His one area of weakness, in my opinion, is his decision-making in the build up. He sometimes makes poor passing choices that lead to dangerous counterattacking breaks from the opposition. But, with proper mentoring from Sam Allardyce I have full confidence that he will learn. He is, after all, only 21 years of age. 

Henry is also somewhat penalty-prone but, again, that can be ironed out with experience. His positives far outweigh his negatives. 

He is also capable of playing as a right fullback, and has done so with the Canadian men's national team.

During a down turn, they would get just a bit more than private sector employees - so would be saying of the downturn: ""we are not feeling it!"", and would still have enough to maintain their lifestyle acting as a stimulus helping the economy recover.

the ups and downs would be covered by long term Govt borrowing, taken out during those low interest recession years, repaid during the high tax receipt boom years.

He didn't always receive the most praise while with us as he costed us the game on several occasions. Mistakes like handballs in the last 10 minutes of play occurred I believe twice in the last season resulting in a red and a penalty for the opposition. His positioning needs some improvement but I'm excited to see what you all do with him as he is after a Canadian international.

He won't be ready for a couple a seasons, that's for damn sure. Expect some loans, he is not even close to being ready to making that big leap to the Premier League. Good luck with him, develop him well for us will you? Canadians would like to try and make the World Cup...

I just don't understand how they can be classed as left wing. They are/were the political wing of the UVF, a right wing paramilitary group who amongst other targets, targeted members of the working class indiscriminately, and to this day target members of other ethnicities or nationalities in purely xenophobic-driven attacks - this goes against something someone on the left wing would do. As recent as 2010 they agreed to maintain their relations with the UVF *and* the Red Hand Commando, another right wing group. The PUP are loyalists, loyal to the 'British Empire', yet again another contradictory thing to do for a left wing group to do. They actively, with arms, supported the extreme right wing government of pre-GFA NI, even allegedly collaborating with the security forces in order to kill underprivileged, second class citizens of the working class - yet again, not something a left wing group would do.

So let me get this straight, they are left wing *only* because their electoral target is the working class loyalist community?
