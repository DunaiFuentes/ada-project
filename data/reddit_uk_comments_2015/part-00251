And to an extent, I know what you mean. Big money, player seems like he fits a certain system.

However, in my experience and opinion, Benteke is miles ahead of where Carroll was when we signed him. Better goalscoring record, better international career, more games played.

Couple this with the fact that despite some similarities, they actually play quite a different way. Benteke CAN play with his back to goal constantly, bringing people into play from a long ball, but he also drops off to receive the ball, runs channels, and runs beyond the defence; Carroll has never done this.

Benteke is quicker, he's technically more accomplished (though I actually think Carroll was better in this regard than some people give him credit for) and he's played for a number of managers and systems.

In short, Benteke IS a better player; am I still a little worried about the purchase and money spent, yes.

null,false,brackan,null,null,null,"It depends on how risky you want to be and how long you are looking to invest. Over the long term shares generally have higher returns than other asset classes that you can put your money into, so the more of your portfolio that is held in shares the higher your return should be, however the risk is also greater. If you go for the LS100 it's all invested in shares and if everything goes well the value will increase more than the LS80 or 60, which are 80 and 60% invested in shares respectively.

In your mid 20s you should really be looking to invest for at least the next 30 years which is a great amount of time for shares to increase in value significantly. I haven't checked but I'm pretty sure whatever isn't invested in equity in a vanguard portfolio goes in to bonds - bonds are more for providing steady income as cash and capital protection (not losing value rather than gaining value with the possibility of loss). Because of this you would expect the LS100 to increase more over the long term than any of the others which have a lower shares to bond ratio, while the others would be less risky due to the bonds they are invested in.

I haven't used nutmeg but from what they say on the website they do a similar thing to Vanguard. They say that they focus on ETFs which I prefer in comparison to unit trusts like the LS funds, however they also add their own charges on to your portfolio which are higher than Vanguards ongoing fees. I can't tell from the website whether you are directly investing in underlying securities through nutmeg or if you are investing in one of the nutmeg funds which then invests for you and I can't tell whether you have the ability to buy or sell individual shares at any time or if they only allow their own investment advisors to do it for you when they want.
Personally I don't like that lack of control but if you're new to investing or don't really care about that then you'd only need to worry about the extra charges that nutmeg levy, whether you think it would be worth paying extra for portfolio more personalised to yourself than what you would get investing in one of the more generic vanguard funds for a lower cost.",null,0,null,1435831129,null,0,false,0,csppl2g,null,t3_3bqv36,null,t1_csppl2g,null,t1_cspoxjz,null,null,null,1437519299,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

Halls are pretty interchangeable bar Langstone. It's further away and makes the commute a bitch. Any of the others were fine.  

Portsmouth people are a mixed bunch, but you'll be interacting largely with Southsea people, which is like a friendlier denomination. As with anywhere, we have our fair share of dickheads. There is a distinct accent and look to the lower class of Portsmouth person (If you've ever watch Peep Show, think the kids that harass Mark on his way into his house) but they are by no means all that bad. Generally a friendly bunch, but worth keeping your wits about in certain parts of the area you'll likely be living/travelling/studying. Southsea is the section of the Portsmouth you will be spending most of your time and that is largely fine.  

You have 4 main choices for nights out that I will try to summarize, though there are exceptions to most of my generalizations:  

Albert Road/Elm Grove - Honest Politician, The Deco, One Eyed Dog, Fat Fox are all student heavy pubs, open till late most nights of the week, playing a variety of music, all with specialty nights, (DnB night, MC nights, Live Acustic, Pub Quiz, Rock&amp; Metal nights) as well as the [Wedgewood Rooms](http://www.wedgewood-rooms.co.uk/) where you will find bands, comedy and club nights in a decent enough intimate sized venue.  Many different options for food to cater to most tastes. 

Palmerston Road: Hong Kong Charlies, Drift Bar, Slug &amp; Lettece.....and others. Not bad for daytime drinking but I don't head there for much more than that, maybe someone else can shed some more light if you need it.  

Guild Hall Walk: The Fleet/Popworld, Lord Isambard, The Terrace/Library, Liquid, Guild Hall. Lots of options for a cheap club night and where I spent most of my time as a student. Close to most halls and campuses, pretty decent but expect your shoes to stick to the carpet.  

Gunwharf - Tiger Tiger, Bar 38......lots of others. Other than on student geared nights, Gunwharf complex likes to bill itself as the high end of nightlife. It's all a bit more expensive, lots of restaurants, a good night out can  be had for sure, but again, not my cup of tea, so maybe someone else can give it a better write up. Again, walking distance from most halls, so that's a bonus.  

For a newbie, particularly a student, I would recommend Albert Road. Find a pub you like the look/sound of and stop in. Not sure what the smoking laws are in Hungary, but here you have to go outside to a designated area. It's usually a good spot to strike up a conversation with others. If you are an /r/trees subscriber, this will also be a good place to make subtle inquiries.  

A word about Kens Kebab. As a student, you owe it to yourself to try it. To this day I have a love hate relationship with Ken in that at 2:30 AM when drunk, I fucking love him and his greasy goodness. 10 AM when I wake up and my gut feels like WWII is happening inside of it, I hate him. Doesn't stop drunk me going back time and time again.

Yes they can rent but you never know when and if you will be made to move out and many tenancy agreements are quite restrictive on what you can and can't do. People don't like change which is why they like to own their own home as it gives a feeling of stability. 

Renting could also be an issue soon too for many young people if the Conservatives still have plans to remove housing benefit entitlement for under 25s. I was kicked out and made homeless at 17.

- Fruit machines are par for the course in any pub, there are normally just 2 or 3 dotted around in the big branches.

Another thing to mention is that Wetherspoons often go to great lengths to keep the feel of the original pub, and emphasize the history as much as possible. The local in my town, Newbury (The Hatchet) is a very good example if you're ever down here.

Well Sherwood is a cryptic fellow but I imagine he meant being more offensive than Villa had played under Lambert, getting Benteke more involved in the build up and try and get him one on one with defenders or in good positions to score from.  

By being a player that can hold up play, it allows the midfielders and wide players to get into quality positions.  By being a large focal point he will draw defenders opening up space for other players to exploit.  By being a player that seems to excel under managers that motivate him, I think Rodgers could very well get him into a good state of mind.

This chart: http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sickness-and-disability-benefits-1-500x205.png
Shows how the amount of people claiming sickness and disability benefits has inexorably climbed since the late 70s. You can draw one of several conclusions from this, maybe more people are physically disabled than before (very unlikely), maybe the requirements for receiving it are easier than before, or maybe people are living longer?  

Ultimately it really does not matter, its more people claiming a state benefit without us having more money to pay for it. The cost is way higher than before, and we either have to raise more taxes, or cut the amount of benefits paid.  

Some people would raise taxes, others take the view that would harm growth and actually make things worse. Neither side is 'evil' or 'cruel'.  

The weird thing to me is how that number of disabled people keeps rising. In the 1950s, being stuck in a wheelchair meant you pretty much could not work, but not any more. You can be a very productive office worker in a wheelchair, and very productive if you are profoundly deaf or blind. Technology has allowed to us to provide useful work for people who previously would be on the scrapheap.

Son if anything the number of claims should be falling as people who previously would have been out of work forever are retrained, or apply for office or work-from home jobs that never existed just twenty years ago. Why is this not happening?

For my course I have often felt as if a low 2.1 requires little effort (though I am told this changes during 2nd/3rd year) whilst a high 2.1 or first requires a great deal of effort (unless you are especially gifted at a particular module). 

We have been told that exam marks get progressively harder to attain as you move up through the 2.1 range, which would explain this phenomenon. This probably suits everyone, as the average student can be confident of getting good job offers (with a 2.1) whilst the grafters can work to differentiate themselves.

Truthfully, a 2.1 is a bare minimum to find professional employment today however. Industry experience through internships or work placements are fast becoming a requirement for a competitive application in certain industries. Thus whilst attaining a low 2.1 may not be the challenge it once was, students are having to do a lot more outside of studying to ensure their careers start right. Additionally, competitive MSc courses require at least ""high 2.1's"" (which I presume to be at least 65), which, as I have been talking about, are still a challenge to attain. 

Edit: It also depends on each individual lecturer's standards. One of my first year lecturers seemed to revel in the fact that students averaged 58% in his exams.

Now it comes to working out how much the costs are. All parties have an obligation to minimise a cost.

For a while, I filled in for him, he did the first, I did the second, He did the third, I did the last. Three notes each, two times.

It worked because he knew the whole song fairly well, just didn't want to sing it alone, since we learned it as a group activity.

Then it because ""our"" song, at least until the next one, so he would do it as soon as I disappeared or changed rooms, he would do just the first three notes, and hope to hear me back.

One day I just did my second part, he did his third, and I forgot to do the rest because I was fairly occupied trying to reach something on a high shelf. He waited, and waited, and eventually filled in himself. When I came back to the room immediately to praise him a lot and give him a bonus seed, he just looked at me, disapproving, like ""honestly, I have to do all the work, you suck at this ""social singing"" thing.""

But then he realized that when he finished the song himself, he got praises and seeds and ""good boy""s, so he's happy to do it.

It comes with a price, though, in order for it to be consistent, I have to respond every time he begins the song, otherwise it's not really fair to him. As usual, it will last a while and then we will learn something new, then it will be all about the new song / noise. I have to choose carefully what I'd like him to learn, because once it starts, he will be practicing a lot, and singing it (awfully the first times) ALL DAY LONG!


If you think you're ready for a parrot, it's a good thing! Honestly, read a lot beforehand. Read about them, you can start [here](http://www.wikihow.com/Decide-if-a-Parrot-Is-Right-for-You) or [here](http://www.birdchannel.com/bird-species/find-the-right-bird/facts-about-parrots.aspx).

Read about THE WORST that they can do, and think about whether you're prepared to put up with it or not. Parrots are messy, they are noisy and they tend to destroy things. Important things are yummier. But yes, you gain a friend for life. The same you put up with babies and kid's lot of work in the first years (and then all along their lives). Think about all that could go wrong (possible SO afraid of birds, what to do if you want to go on a vacation, other family members feeling left out, that sort of thing, the same as with any other pet), and then.... think again!

Then if you're ready, welcome aboard! If you have time and attention to give to another living creature, you'll probably make someone very happy!

On the other hand, they have three windows domains - test/ release/ live, allowing a fantastic way of thoroughly testing any changes to the live system (different staff for each domain, so if you make a change plan someone else executes it on the release domain and comes back with any isssues;, then a third team deploys it).

&gt; What I disagree with is alliance acting sole arbitrators in the whole thing and ignoring advice from real neutral community organisations, and the argument that taking the flag down for most days was in the name of equality. Because if that's the case we sure don't have equal treatment in any nat dominated council.



Can you expand on this? I was of the opinion all of the neutral advice was that taking the flag down was the right decision?

null,false,EmilioRebenga,null,null,null,"&gt;The weird thing to me is how that number of disabled people keeps rising. Technology has allowed to us to provide useful work for people who previously would be on the scrapheap. So if anything the number of claims should be falling as people who previously would have been out of work forever are retrained, or apply for office or work-from home jobs that never existed just twenty years ago. **Why is this not happening?**



Part of the reason is medical advancements.
The same reason we have an ageing population, it isn't that people are lying about their age we simply, on average, survive longer.

The same reason that conditions previously like heart attacks, cancers, pulmonary disease and the other big killers are increasing in their post disease state burden, is because they are now more treatable. Instead of dying from the disease you now survive it but then you are faced with the problems as a population and individual of the recovery from this.

If you look at cystic fibrosis patient info you would see similar, as you would with many diseases like IBD, RA and the list is endless. 
These diseases increase in prevalence largely due to the fact that as we get better at diagnosing disease, the incidence is artificially inflated.

Better treatment also leads to greater survivability into far older ages than previously seen. 

With the exception of alcohol  /hepatic disease the big killers of cardiovascular and cancers are generally decreasing, so people are generally living longer with the disabilities they may have.

Even at birth ante-natal medical advances have resulted in viability dropping from near enough 28 weeks to far lower than this, the result is greater numbers surviving but sometimes you have to accept that individuals will have to live with the disabilities and recovery required from their condition. 

There are literally thousands of examples of conditions that used to be life threatening that are now not and you live with them. Organ transplantation, bacterial sepsis, modern ICU survival rates compared to the 1980s, MI, stroke, dementia, many cancer types, autoimmune disease, foetal birth abnormalities, COPD/Emphysema, Diabetes, PVD, Trauma, Neurological disability. The list is genuinely endless.

This could indicate a reason to why disability claims are increasing from a medical perspective.
There may well be social / bureaucratic reasons too I wouldn't know, but it is well established that multi morbidity is increasing and this will only increase in the future, that is one of the "" downsides"" of a good medical system. (not a true downside but a consequence, living longer often means living longer in poorer health.)

You could even argue that the increasing disparity in wealth is driving the increases in ""disabilities.""

Alcoholism is on the rise across the board.
Smoking is decreasing but it is widely accepted poorer socio-economic demographics have greater morbidity. Multi-morbidity will accumulate to cause disability.
So the country getting poorer may actually be the reason for this, as the inequality rises the prevalence of the working class diseases (mainly CVD, COPD, certain cancers, alcohol and other drug related) increases. 
This would again suggest that making cuts to these areas is counter intuitive and makes the problem worse, not better. And that policy decisions are actually causing greater burden on the NHS and taxpayers etc, so in effect some types of austerity may actually be counter productive.

[Multimorbidity obviously closely matches disability and the ability of a person to work, this shows how rates change over many factors to simply illustrate a small part of what I was saying.] (http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960240-2/abstract)

Yes, it may be that people are claiming more than ever and I am sure there is some dishonesty behind that somewhere, as with all things, but this could well be in the minority and there are plenty of legitimate reasons for this too, the Sun may not point these out but they are there and potentially far more significant than the population suddenly , for some unknown reason, becoming lazier or whatever over 30 years which wouldn't seem right.

null,false,Milemarker80,null,null,null,"&gt; You can draw one of several conclusions from this, maybe more people are physically disabled than before (very unlikely)

Or maybe you've drawn completely the wrong conclusion here?  There are many more physically disabled people than in the 1970's - both due to the increase in population (approx. 10 million / 15% from ONS, 1970 to 2013), but also due to advances in healthcare.

Cystic Fibrosis sufferers alone have seen an increase in life expectancy from around 10 years in 1963 to around and upwards of 41 now.  Advances in treatment, drugs and lifestyles mean that disabled individuals can live longer than ever, and this is expected to rise into the future.  And generally this applies across every long term condition in working age adults - people are living longer, both healthy and unhealthy.

In some cases, this may mean that disabled people can work - or work longer than in the past.  In many cases, it doesn't, advances in medicine may mean a more comfortable and longer life, but not to the extent of bring them into the 'workforce'.  In other cases, people are suffering bouts of disabling conditions more often, after which they may make a recovery and re-join the workforce.

This latter group is a common situation for cancer patients especially, where advances in cancer screening and treatment means that we are identifying and treating more cancers than ever before - but resulting in an increase in people claiming short-medium term disability while undergoing treatment.

Honestly, if you really wanted to dramatically cut disability benefits, the most effective way to go about it would be to cut back medical treatments to those available in the 1970's.  Since that's obviously inhumane, I guess this proposal is the next best thing - cutting off the support available to a particularly vulnerable section of society is likely to have a similar effect with it's impact on living conditions, diet and ability to access transport for treatment.",null,0,null,1435836238,null,0,false,0,cspqu3q,null,t3_3bujgy,null,t1_cspqu3q,null,t1_cspq152,null,null,null,1437520365,null,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17,null

It will most likely take mod intervention to get these threads off the ground, which would be fantastic if the mods were willing to do that.

Another suggestion I would have would be to maybe add a rule where you can delete posts with misleading or false titles.

I provided an example illustrating why this was incorrect.  When I was studying for my GCSEs we did have such calculators available, and someone did write a cipher program - purely because of interest in the subject.  If we've now reached the stage where modern calculators aren't even allowed it's very sad, but might explain why even students who've studied maths at A level have no apparent ability to do maths relevant to my workplace.  I would not expect calculators to actually be banned, but it's a fair illustration of how silly the reasoning is.

The point is that even if you restrict the ban to 'online messaging' you will fail, since even a twenty year old graphics calculator is capable of doing the crunching, and easy to use libraries are available and widely used.  The idea of banning encrypted messaging is reminiscent of King Canute expecting the tide to not come in, and as someone who's had to implement it, the whole concept is completely farcical.

Nobody is denying that a programmable computer, including some models of calculator, can perform encryption.  That doesn't lead to 'students can't use calculators if encryption is banned'.  At all.  First of all because most calculators used by A-Level students aren't programmable in that way.

There's discussion below regarding our chances of top four: at the moment I think we have to be considered more likely than City and United.

Both have real problems in their squad, and these haven't been addressed. But the key definition is the term ""YET"". Both teams have the money to strengthen above and beyond us.

As it stands though, I'd take our team over City's and maybe over United.

Think about our attack in comparison to City:

Lallana/Firmino/Coutinho/Sterling are all pretty much nailed on for a starting spot, plus Ibe and Markovic as potential/backups.

City have Nasri/Silva/Navas/Jovetic. Nasri has not looked the same player as a couple of years ago, Navas is unbelievably quick but his end product is shocking, Silva is of course pure class but Jovetic can't stay fit. I'd take our players ahead of them.

United have Di Maria/Depay/Young/Valencia/Rooney. On paper, pretty decent. But Di Maria has never looked settled in England, and out of form, Depay COULD be a huge flop (though I doubt it), Young played well last year but he won't maintain it, Valencia is average and Rooney will probably alternate his positions. So United are NECESSARILY in a much better position than us.

Basically, if Sterling stays, I think we'll nail top four especially if that involves not moving to City.

As I understand it the main issue here is that it seems it has become perfectly acceptable to poach all the best talent around, create a squad of 30 international level players for 11 positions and let the rest rot in the reserves with ridiculous buying prices based on potential that you willingly admit your club will never look to explore but it is not acceptable for other clubs to take advantage of this situation to give the players a chance to showcase their skills and get a move to a club where they can continue and expand their careers. If you think about it hypocritically like this the story suddenly makes sense, how dare we, the poor relation, look to compete without the money of our frivolous rivals, we should just accept our place and only buy mediocre players on outright contracts. To call the loan system a temporary structure negates the fact the parent club still owns the player after the loan spell, they save on wages (sometimes also profiting from a loan fee), they were not going to use the player so the players potential actually gets explored and they get experience at the top levels of the game and that they will profit from increased transfer values of successful players (and be able to let unsuccessful players go). It completely ignores the benefits to the parent clubs who all willingly participate in the system and instead gives the impression that the loan system has been forced upon them.

The big problem with changing the way relative poverty is quantified, if indeed it can be is that previously we had a baseline and with a new set of metrics we do not.  This means even if the previously created figures were a bit woolly, we have no way of saying if the problem has got better or not because the goal posts have changed.  By introducing factors such as single parent families or how far you live from a library or what ever dilutes the argument that if you can't afford to heat your home or buy clothes for your kids, something is wrong. 

To quote Imran Hussain, the director of policy for the Child Poverty Action Group âProducing a way forward for tackling poverty that doesnât recognise that poverty is about money is pretty astonishing,â

As an example of this - look at the way Gove has handled education with changes to Ofsted and grading of kids progress.  The figures created now have no relationship to the last 2 incarnations over the last 5 years.  We have no idea how kids well are doing at school nor do we know if the changes in curriculum have been effective because there is very little meaningful way of correlating results.  We can't even tell whether a failing school that has been forcefully acadamised is preforming any better because its classed as a new school so previous data across the board is not applicable. 

My concern is that if the child tax credits are introduced and something like 66% children from working parents are effected, there will be no way of quantifying the change.  What the government seeking to do is deliberately and effectively hiding this data before it can be created.

By repealing the 2010 Child Poverty Act, the government is no longer responsible for meeting its own targets - and that is a very bad thing for anyone affected by it.",null,0,null,1435838824,null,0,false,0,csprmaj,null,t3_3brpzt,null,t1_csprmaj,null,t1_cspqm7u,null,null,null,1437521064,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Given your level of income and the tax advantaged options available, listed in the bullets below, it is unlikely that you'll need to hold shares/funds/ETF in a taxable form.

* **ISA:** Money is taxed before it reaches an ISA (i.e. as you earn it) and so any gains or income from an ISA is tax-free. 
* **Pension:** Money in a pension is not yet taxed (i.e. as income tax gets added back on to it as you contribute), is free of capital gains tax, but is taxable as income when withdrawn (some additional rules apply like 25% can be withdrawn tax free).

If you do hold assets outside of an ISA or Pensions (again, unlikely considering the options already available) which you sell for a taxable gain then the gain can be split amongst you equally (i.e. 50/50) if it is jointly owned. This goes for a joint taxable trading account (shares/funds/ETFs) or for a jointly owned second home or investment property (your primary residence is free of capital gains tax anyway). You *could* put an asset entirely in your spouses name so that later down the line the capital gain is entirely in their name but that potentially comes with a whole set of other problems and is generally not worth the risk. Shares/ETFs/funds in a taxable account can be sold/bought to make use of the annual capital gains tax allowance to reduce your potential tax bill in the future (just be aware of the various rules regarding bed &amp; breakfasting (wash sale?)). Stamp duty makes this less effective with shares.

Most people nowadays (maybe not in fan spaces like this) would probably go with Tenant/Smith/Capaldi. Only the highly touted episodes of past doctors are likely to be seen by wider audiences.

As much as I liked John Hurt as the Doctor, his character still lacks development and it's not likely he'll have the chance again as the only new stories don't involve Hurt.

My personal favourites are Tenant, Capaldi and McGann.

McGann will probably stick out as a hideous choice to many, but I listen to audiobooks all the time and really enjoy the Eighth Doctor plays - they've expanded his character and motivations and there's a lot of interesting interactions/background we don't see nowadays.

Tenant, well, he revived my interest in Doctor Who after only having seen a small amount of Baker's Doctor. It probably helps that he had modern SFX to help with the suspension of disbelief required to enjoy a good sci-fi, but his Doctor was also much more affable to me than Eccleston.

Kyle was so highly revered because not only was he a good old country boyo who was a real salt of the earth bloke, not only was he just a squaddie, but he was a navy seal. Which is fair to say it made him a pretty hard cunt. Then after he came back from his tours he started working with his fellow vets who had suffered ptsd as a result of serving overseas. 

If we had a similar culture of squaddie worship we'd probably treat Chris Ryan or Andy McNab the same.

 Like when that Royal Marine spotted a taliban in a field who'd been mortally wounded by I think an apache gunship or something, then he dealt him a coup de grace and forgot to switch his helmet cam off or something and got convicted for it iirc loads of ukip and bnp types were saying ""He was only doing his job."" Despite him having shot an unarmed combatant in cold blood which is against rules of engagement and the Geneva convention etc

Back on point though. Why doesn't Boyle seem to hold other ethnic communities to our standards? I don't see him write about BME rioters or BME people comitting hate crimes except for when he blames it on whitey.

&gt;""According to the Labour Force Survey, disabled people are now more likely to be employed than they were in 2002, but disabled people remain significantly less likely to be in employment than non-disabled people. In 2012, 46.3% of working-age disabled people are in employment compared to 76.4% of working-age non-disabled people. There is therefore a 30.1 percentage point gap between disabled and non-disabled people, representing over 2 million people. The gap has reduced by 10 percentage points over the last 14 years and has remained stable over the last two years despite the economic climate""

I just don't see it, Ibe wasn't even picked for the U21 Euros and I haven't seen him rated by many other people other than some Liverpool fans. Meanwhile Sterling at 17/18 was receiving praise from pretty much everyone including Henry, Gary Neville etc and loads of others.

Ibe seems pretty one dimensional, all he can really do is run, dribble and be strong. His passing and vision seem pretty average for his age and his finishing doesn't seem that good either. Sterling at Ibe's age showed he was better at passing, finishing, vision etc.. his stats last season were up there with some of our best players. Ibe's stats for this season just gone are some of the worst in our team. 0.87 chances created per 90 minutes is just so bad... even if he's playing wingback that's awful, Markovic was on 1.83 per 90... all Ibe really showed this season is he can run really fast down the line and get past the defender and put in a bad/average final ball.

&gt;You're right, he's had to work hard. But there's a difference between going to training every day and doing what you need to, to cancelling your holiday to do extra training.

Ibe wouldn't have done this if he was in the U21 Euro squad, or if he had played 60 games in the last season off of the back of playing in the WC like Sterling just did.

Then again? I think we have found out the secret ingredient of Sugar Puffs. I also kind of know now why the Honey Monster is Yellow. 

I figured since we are on the subject of interesting smelling urines and food/urine combos... 

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup_urine_disease 

Yep. It's a pretty horrible disease with a 50% scrumptious name. 

MSUD has an estimated incidence of 1/150,000 live births. There is no data to suggest what number of patients has intermittent MSUD but it is probably underdiagnosed.

Unlike classic MSUD (see this term), patients with intermittent MSUD show normal growth and intellectual development during infancy and childhood. They may develop symptoms (mainly in childhood) with any catabolic stress (i.e. fasting, dehydration, fever, infections or pregnancy (in adults)). These precipitating factors can lead to a potentially fatal episode of acute decompensation with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, ataxia (in infants/toddlers), cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, hyperactivity, mood swings, acute dystonia, and choreoathetosis (in adults), that can progress to stupor, coma and cerebral edema. Intelligence and development are not usually affected by these episodes.

The prognosis is good if metabolic control is maintained during times of stress and any episodes of acute decompensation are immediately treated.

To date there has been no discovery of Sugar Puff Urine Disease. If so? I bagsy it as *INSERT MY REAL NAME HERE* Syndrome.

basically you'll end up with about half the interest you may expect because you won't be able to put all the money into the account all at once. You could consider using an additional high interest current account (lloyds is 4% up to Â£5000, santander is 3% up to Â£20,000) or read about ISAs etc, depending on whether you want easy access to your money or not.

With regards to the TSB regular saver, the max you can put in is Â£250/mo. So the max you can have in there at the end of the year is Â£3000. On average you'll have Â£1500 in there, so vaguely speaking, before tax you will make Â£75. If you chucked Â£5000 in lloyds you'd make Â£200. With Â£7000 in santander you'd make Â£210

null,false,RedScouse,lfc12,,null,"Sterling was decent in the second half of last to last season, with Studge and Suarez. He was exceptional during the World Cup. He was above average for the first half of this season (in a very underwhelming side might I add), and he was rubbish the second half of this season. 

You're thoroughly overestimating his ability. He's good no doubt, as can be gleaned from his performances with SAS and the first half of this season, but he is nowhere near consistent enough to command a starting place in a top side (apart from maybe City, but that's a maybe). He makes the wrong decision quite often, especially when under pressure. He missed a ridiculous number of sitters last season, ran into cul de sacs, and delayed when he should have picked a pass or shot. These things can obviously be rectified if he learns and develops, but if you're not taking into account his potential and his current level of play is his limit, then those types of errors guarantee that he's not worth 30 million. 

Moreover, Schurrle went for Â£22 million (not Â£28 like your post says) to Wolfsburg, and they overpaid slightly considering he was going from a CL team to a Europa League team. Additionally, he did well for Chelsea and scored and assisted some really important goals, considering he came off the bench a fair bit. 

Bony went for Â£27 million to an oil rich team that love to overpay. That being said, Bony has performed better at Swansea (I think he's scored something like 35 goals in two seasons), than Sterling has over the past two years, whilst playing on a worse team. Bony is a better player than Sterling, if you take into account just current level of ability; he basically carried that Swansea team with his scoring and creative ability.

Anyways that's just my two cents. This sub overestimates Sterling a fair bit. He's a good player no doubt, but players of similar ability are a dime a dozen; he is mostly sought after because of his potential and because he's English (at least for City). Top 15 AMs sure, but that's because we can't think of that many top level attacking midfielders. I mean Steven N'zonzi is a top 5-15 defensive midfielder in the league, but does that mean he's world class? I wouldn't say so. It just means he's pretty good.

It's the cheapest, which is great (although the price has gone up by 30% since I was there), but at least when I was there, it was fucking awful. Rooms were tiny (take a small single bed, the room is about 2.5x the width and 2x the length of that bed), furniture was as cheap as it gets, and the only 'common room' (aka, accessable comfortable chair) was in another building which didn't seem to have heating.

The kitchens are ok, but I wish I'd been able to lock the cupboard I stored stuff in - several of the people I shared with would steal my food or use and not wash my utensils. This is normal for students, sadly. Looking at the website, they've at least painted the walls now, so it doesn't look like a miniature prison cell at least.

If you need to save money, and you don't mind being in a tiny room, or are likely to not spend your time at home, it's not too bad an option. The price sounds sort of steep, but given it includes bills and really fast internet, it's really pretty good.

The location is no more than ten minutes from almost any part of the university, so being late shouldn't be a problem.

Get an underground map from the station. I will use the line colours below.

Board a Picadilly line (dark blue line on map.) train to Cockfosters (Eastbound Platform). Take this train all the way to South Kensington station (about 40 minutes journey).

At South Kensington, change for the Eastbound District Line towards Tower Hill / Upminster (green line) or Eastbound Circle Line (yellow) towards Edgware Road. I prefer the Circle Line as it's air conditioned and bigger (so sometimes worth waiting - especially in summer).

Take this to Monument Station (around 15 - 20 minutes).

Monument Station is also known as Bank station - the two are interconnected and share lines.

At Monument, look for the DLR (Docklands Light Railway). Follow the signs to the DLR (might be a 5 minute walk) - this brings you into Bank station. There is only one platform from here. Wait for the train that says **I THINK** St George via London City Airport (it will defo say London City Airport) - or ask someone who works there.

Take that train to London City Airport (maybe another 40 minutes).

Would get into City's over Navas probably, and with Milner gone also he'll probably start quite a few games. But what 20 year old is consistent to start for a top side anyway? it's quite rare to see.

&gt;He makes the wrong decision quite often, especially when under pressure. He missed a ridiculous number of sitters last season, ran into cul de sacs, and delayed when he should have picked a pass or shot. These things can obviously be rectified if he learns and develops, but if you're not taking into account his potential and his current level of play is his limit, then those types of errors guarantee that he's not worth 30 million. 

Coutinho makes the wrong decision a shit ton too, the amount of times he shoots from outside the box instead of passing it/keeping possession is shocking. He also ran into defenders a lot whilst trying to find a way through. Do you also think he's not worth Â£30m due to that?  Sterling missed a few sitters, but it was only like 5,that's really not that many - especially considering playing upfront isn't his position.

&gt;Additionally, he did well for Chelsea and scored and assisted some really important goals, considering he came off the bench a fair bit.

Yeah so did Sterling, without him last season we wouldn't have finished top 4. Up until December we had Victor Moses in the team over him, we wouldn't have finished top 4 if Moses had stayed in the team over Sterling.

&gt;Bony went for Â£27 million to an oil rich team that love to overpay. That being said, Bony has performed better at Swansea (I think he's scored something like 35 goals in two seasons), than Sterling has over the past two years, whilst playing on a worse team. Bony is a better player than Sterling, if you take into account just current level of ability; he basically carried that Swansea team with his scoring and creative ability.

Maybe so, but that doesn't mean Bony is worth double what Sterling is worth surely.

&gt;Anyways that's just my two cents. This sub overestimates Sterling a fair bit. He's a good player no doubt, but players of similar ability are a dime a dozen; he is mostly sought after because of his potential and because he's English (at least for City).

But we could not go out into the market and simply pick up a player of a similar ability to Sterling for Â£15-20m unless we got pretty lucky.

Your conclusion does not follow your premiss. We can make society more tolerant by making people more tolerant or by removing intolerant people from society, no?

I used to work with a devout Christian. Being irreligious myself, I'm often in the habit of saying ""Jesus Christ"" when I'm exasperated. My colleague let me know that he found it upsetting when I did that. 

Do I think that's a reasonable thing to be upset about? Not really (I think anyone who ascribes to any theistic dogma that I am aware of, is naive and and suffering from delusional thinking). 

Do I think I have the right to say Jesus Christ, whenever I feel like it? Yes.

Did I tell him he's stupid, that I have the right to say what I want and then continue to say ""Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ"" just to piss him off? Of course not, that would make me an arse hole and would serve no purpose whatsoever. I apologised for upsetting him, explained that wasn't my intention and said I'd try to keep it in mind for the future. 

Why? Because I'm not a arse hole who enjoys upsetting people for no reason, I didn't even particularly like the guy.

Gerrard eating a sandwich - probably not the type of post we'd allow here. Gerrard scoring a nice goal for the LA Galaxy - nothing wrong with that.
I think you're worrying a little too much. We're not going to have LA Galaxy match threads here, but when Gerrard does something of note people want to see it. That's not going to happen every minute of every day. So when he scores a goal we're not going to remove those highlights. At that point we'd have to ban all the other former players highlights that get posted here.

Which I'm ok with, however I've gone through this before. I am a huge LFC fan but this is very similar to the way Paul Pierce left the celtics. He represented the celtics for 15 years, and I had to watch him drop everything he built (including a championship which hadn't happened for the Celtics in many many years) and go play for another team. I get the feeling that he will always be part of the team, and is by any standards a legend, but now he's part of the Galaxy. If all we do as a sub is talk about former players we really aren't looking towards the future.

""Barcelona are confident of beating Chelsea to the signing of this player with him expected to complete the Â£25M move as soon as personal terms are finalised. Barca coach Luis Enrique requested the 28-year-old Atletico Madrid midfielder be signed before he went on holiday. It now seems that when he returns to begin pre-season training the captain of the Turkey national side will be under his orders although he will not be able to play for Barca in an official match until 2016 because of their FIFA-imposed ban on registering players. His willingness to give up five months of football is not the only extraordinary thing about the transfer. He had an indifferent season last year and neither his age nor his price appear particularly appealing but although the prospect of his switch to the Nou Camp has raised eyebrows among some Barca supporters it seems Luis Enrique sees something in the fiery playmaker who last year through his boot at a linesman in a cup defeat against Barcelona. Chelsea were interested in signing Turan but he seems set on a move to Spanish champions Barcelona. Barcelona do not see the pending acquisition of Turan as a barrier to them signing Paul Pogba who they expect to take next summer after laying the foundations for an agreement with both the player and Juventus this week. Barcelonaâs midfield has lost some big names in recent seasons with Thiago Alcantara and Cesc Fabregas being sold and Xavi moving to Qatar. Now with Turan and Pogba looking well on their way that imbalance will be righted over the next two seasons. Turan signed for Atletico Madrid in 2011 from Galatasaray and was due to stay at the club until the end of the 2017 season. The playerâs agent Ahmed Bulut was still insisting on Wednesday night that his player had still not spoken to Barcelona but all major sports dailies were reporting the deal as good as done on Thursday morning.""",null,0,null,1435849923,null,0,false,0,cspwz4o,null,t3_3bqi2z,null,t1_cspwz4o,null,t3_3bqi2z,null,null,null,1437524522,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

Kane has a smaller sample size. He could turn out to be a flash in the pan, but I don't think so. He's very intelligent and reads the game fantastically. He has a lot of intangibles to push him forward. But he will certainly fall off this season. If he gets 15+ I would say it's a good season for him following the monster he just had.

The plans for Chelseaâs new stadium have, apparently, been inspired by the architecture of Westminster Abbey. It is a bold claim, and perhaps a bit of a red herring. Going to Premiership football at the weekend might be a contemporary version of weekend worship â but has little in common with time in the pew at prayer.
The stadium plans were revealed, in outline form, at a three-day public consultation in a room beneath Chelseaâs looming East stand. They have been designed by Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron working with London practice Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands. Herzog &amp; de Meuron are also the designers of the Tate Modern and the Beijing âBirdsâ Nestâ Olympic stadium and this week they received permission to go ahead with a huge glass pyramid tower in Paris.
Although only sparse detail was revealed, the few glimpses show a huge leap in capacity from the current 42,000 to 60,000 and there were some intriguing details.
Much research had been done into the original Stamford Bridge (after which the stadium is named), apparently a 14th-century structure which stood near the site and belonged to the Diocese of Westminster â hence the connection with the Abbey.
Inspired by this historical titbit, a long new bridge has been proposed to take supporters from the adjacent Fulham Road directly into the stadium on a long elevated walkway. Looking like Chelseaâs answer to New Yorkâs High Line, this structure is expressed in a long run of brick arches â which echo the familiar railway arches that snake through the centre of the city â and is intended to accommodate a row of cafÃ©s, bars and supportersâ shops.
The stadium itself was only sketchily revealed but the drawings indicated a gothic-influenced structure with slender uprights rising to roof level where they run along the roofs to converge at a circular ring beam supporting the continuous roof. Each roof support points towards the centre circle on the pitch, which would certainly look impressive in aerial shots.
Stamford Bridge is a determinedly urban stadium, built in 1906 and set in the dense fabric of west London between Fulham, Chelsea and Earlâs Court. It is a fast-changing cityscape with huge redevelopments of land around Earl's Court and the railway lines.
The plans indicate an appropriately urban response. There are soaring brick arcades terminating in complex vaults, sculptural concrete stairs and a rather retro feel to a brutalist-inflected architectural language. Perhaps it was influenced in part by architects Darbourne and Darkeâs industrial East Stand, as well as Londonâs tradition of tough public buildings â from the National Theatre to Tate Modern.
The extra capacity comes from a new upper tier running all the way round the ground, which will allow fans to more or less keep their existing seats. The pitch will be slightly lowered, keeping the seats as close as possible to the action. Two hotels on the site will be demolished â the ground will be dedicated solely to football. Herzog &amp; De Meuron have form in stadium design. The Birdsâ Nest was widely acclaimed (even if it now stands an empty tourist attraction) and they recently completed a remarkably elegant stadium for Bordeaux, a slim roof supported on a forest of impossibly slender columns. Bayern Munichâs inflatable stadium meanwhile â encased in see-through pillows of illuminated, puffed-up plastic, is one of the most striking stadiums of recent years. They also designed the ground for FC Basel, a more modest but very effective ground â attended at weekends by the football-mad Herzog himself.
Each of these though is, in its own way, the diametric opposite of the solid, urban designs for Stamford Bridge.
These earlier stadiums stand alone, outside the city. For Chelsea the designs take on a deliberately urban form, embedded in the city. The proposals follow years of speculation that the club would move â to Battersea Power Station, to Earl's Court. The clubâs owner, Roman Abramovich, has now ruled out moving and with these designs shows how serious he is about staying. The project is expected to cost at least Â£500m and would entail the club moving from their ground â speculation has revolved around Twickenham â for at least three years.",null,0,null,1435849978,null,0,false,0,cspx0bt,null,t3_3bvotu,null,t1_cspx0bt,null,t3_3bvotu,null,null,null,1437524534,null,14,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,14,null

So basically the gist here is that we ought not get a new manager because the current one knows the current batch of players?

This is amusing since we are getting 6 new players by the looks of it but either ways how long are we going to keep Rodgers because he has had one good season?

We all get high and mighty with those unbeaten runs but we also have to look at other teams during the period.

Many of them are known for struggling during that period. Like how some teams are able to start strongly and some are able to finish strongly.

Anyways what I am trying to get to is: the fact that Rodgers did get us to finish second.
But look at it objectively.
He was not meant to go for a win against Chelsea, a draw was all that was needed but he was too deluded to even grasp that fact and was outsmarted.

The man doesn't really know much apart from one style of play and it takes makes it easy for opponents to play against us.

There were many instances last season where he was lost and you could see that he had ran out of ideas.
How long are we really going to keep up with this in the hopes we will finish second again?

Wishful thinking at best but it still is not good enough.

But Ibe other than just being pure potential, I think has the edge on him in a few areas that I think are really important.  The most important of which is his ability to strike the ball with real pace and precision both when shooting and crossing. Also, I think he has more physical potential in terms of overall strength, and I think he will continue to improve his ability to take on defenders with time in the premier league as he gains confidence.

I don't think Sterling is likely to improve much in his physical prowess.  I don't see him getting much pacier or tricky, and it remains to be see if he will improve the quality of his finishing/crossing.  If we can anywhere close to 50 million I think we should take it.  If nothing else because Sterling himself seems to believe he's already arrived and is less likely to be honest with addressing and working on the weaknesses in his game.

They'd also argue lots of Muslims who have nothing to do with extremism die as a result of our foreign policy, indeed, that our foreign policy has been the cause of much of the extremism.

It's why discussion on here is virtually dead, you showed a non conforming mentality to the typical left wing socialist ideas (that you hint at not even being your own you just want it discussed) and you get downvoted as if you are morally wrong to ask such a question.
You really do stifle debate on here by just downvoting anything that doesn't resemble left wing socialism. But thats never going to change so accept it, its why I rarely comment on these threads anymore except for rare examples like this for this reason.

Your question certainly has merit and there is no way my response could justify ALL of the increases, in any situation there are many factors at play and your post was a good one and made me aware of something I wasn't previously, so I appreciated even if the rest of reddit clearly doesn't. I am sure bureaucratic reasons may be down to figures being altered over time too as you eluded too. A post that made me more aware of something I didn't know previously is useful for sure.

null,false,Freeky,eng-durham,County Durham,null,"Well, it's kind of fundamental.  You're using encryption so the user can't decrypt it and post it to a torrent site or whatever, but with the same breath you give them the keys to decrypt the data so they can use it.  There isn't really any way around it.

It pretty much always boils down to security by obscurity.  That's all most of it is - make the code too complex to follow so an attacker finds it difficult to extract the key.  And this can be very effective - StarForce, with its [obfuscated polymorphic virtual machine](http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=1728) lasted a good year or more.

Things like Blu-Ray players have it easier, since they can keep their keys locked away in hardware security modules, but it's much the same principle.  And they still [leaked like a sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy).

All that's an aside, though.  The real point is my last sentence:

&gt; I'm pretty sure they're not going to mind too much handing them over to the government

There's no talk of banning encryption outright, ""just"" making sure the government can always get the keys - you could be using a one-time-pad for all they care, so long as you hand them over.

&gt;__Cambridge North railway Station__ is a proposed [railway station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_station) that will be located in the [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge) suburb of [Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterton,_Cambridge), close to [Cambridge Science Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Science_Park). The official proposal from Cambridgeshire County Council, which has the backing of the rail industry, is to locate the station at Chesterton Sidings on the [Fen Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fen_Line), which runs from [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_railway_station) to [King's Lynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Lynn_railway_station). The station will connect to the [Cambridgeshire Guided Busway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire_Guided_Busway) and provide an interchange with [Park &amp; Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_%26_Ride) and [local Stagecoach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagecoach_in_Cambridge) bus services. The station was approved in December 2013. Construction commenced in July 2014 and the station is due to be operational by December 2016. The currently proposed name for the station is __Cambridge North__, but it has also been referred to as __Cambridge Science Park station__ and __Chesterton station__.

Service history is good to see, too, the more work it's had done recently, the better. If you aren't sure on any of this, ask somebody to come along with you, or read a lot of guides on the internet.

So, the TL;DR seems to be:

- **Barry Hunter** is the chief scout, compiling reports on key targets and players recommended by other scouts.

- **Michael Edwards** analyses data from various leagues to make suggestions about players worth scouting, and to provide statistical analysis on possible targets

- **Brendan Rodgers** outlines which positions need strengthening. He'll suggest his own targets and have to state the case for them to the committee. He can rule out players that he doesn't think are good enough, and he can veto signings (but is sometimes forced to accept something over nothing)

- **Dave Fallows** co-ordinates the club's scouting. More of an administrative and overseeing role compared to Barry Hunter. When Rodgers outlines the areas that need improvement, Fallows draws up a shortlist of potential targets using the information from Edwards, Hunter and the rest of the scouts.

- **Ian Ayre** gets on his bike and handles negotiations.

- **Mike Gordon** pulls the plug if the deal doesn't make financial sense; otherwise, makes it rain.",null,0,null,1435854517,null,0,false,0,cspzw8x,null,t3_3bvuyp,null,t1_cspzw8x,null,t3_3bvuyp,null,null,null,1437526648,null,39,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,39,null

null,false,RedScouse,lfc12,,null,"Coutinho at least makes a decision; sometimes it's the incorrect decision to shoot, but at least he makes it without delay and we get a chance on goal. Sterling will delay, then either get dispossessed or completely lose the opportunity. It is his inaction that leads to issues; and when he's forced to act, ie the only thing he can do in that scenario is shoot, he will miss completely. He lacks that decisiveness and composure that is so important for players in his position. Additionally, Coutinho has moments of absolute magic. Did you see that backheel volleyed lob last season? That trickery and just out of the box thinking is something Sterling can't do, its why I rate him higher. 

Regarding the Moses comment, you could put a brick wall on, and it'll be better than Moses. Sterling did well for a stretch of 7 games with SAS, and he was good, but keep in mind, we were playing with SAS. Those two opened up numerous spaces for Sterling and got him the ball in very good situations. Sure Sterling's movement was very good off the ball, but SAS were still instrumental in the success Sterling had that season. 

Â£27m for Bony, and Â£20m for Sterling; that's a difference of Â£7 million. Take into account City overpay, January window tends to have inflated prices and Bony is a better player, that's a very reasonable difference between the two. It's not double, as you said. 

We just bought Firmino for Â£22m not including add ons, Bony went for Â£27m and he's a better player as mentioned above, Jovetic went for Â£22m and he had better seasons for Fiorentina than Raheem has ever had with us while City is also a club that tends to overpay. Navas was also signed for Â£15m and he was an absolute monster at Sevilla for years before he justified that price tag. There are many alternatives of similar current, or perhaps better, ability to Sterling that have been signed in the past. Â£15-20m for Sterling is a very accurate price in my opinion for him, if his current level of play is his limit.

null,false,uknowSawyer,null,null,null,"&gt; *Who will they buy/sell this transfer window?*


With Clyne gone and most likely Schneiderlin to follow Southampton are gonna have to splash some cash to make up for the hole in the squad that selling two of your big players is gonna make. They clearly need a new RB and possibly a new CB after the end of Toby's loan spell, since I don't rate Yoshida/Gardos good enough for the starting lineup. If they play the 4-2-3-1 formation in your post, which I think will make the most sense, they could possibly get away with replacing Schneiderlin with Ward-Prowse, although they would have to somewhat change the way they play if that was to happen. It would probably not be ideal but on the other hand I don't think it would be too terrible either since Ward-Prowse is a huge talent and getting him as much first team football as possible will be the best outcome for Southampton in the long run.


&gt; *What needs improving?*


This is kind of the same question as the one above but I don't think they can afford not to get two new players to replace Clyne and Toby in defense. Personally I'm not too sure about their striker options, I doubt they will make any real improvements to the position this season but I really think they should if they can afford it after they are done with the priority signings which should be in defense. I'm not a big fan of PellÃ© and in general I'm not too keen on a big stationary striker who couldn't outrun Mertesacker to save his own life. I think that type of striker is fine to have, but I really don't like that type of striker to be in a starting 11 since it just seems to limit your tactical options so much. Shane Long is a decent striker, I don't really think he is good enough and I thought hey overpaid for him when they bought him, and over all I think they are lacking a proper striker.


&gt; *How will they do next season?*


Although they showed last season that they can adapt very fluid and very quickly to massive changes in the squad I don't think it will be the same story if they lose Clyne and Schneiderlin this transfer window. I think they overperformed last season and if they're gonna lose another two huge players for them then I don't see them finishing near European football. Of course it all depends on which signings they can make in this window but I think they will probably end up as a mid table team finishing around 10th this season.",null,0,null,1435854755,null,0,false,0,csq01nx,null,t3_3bpep2,null,t1_csq01nx,null,t3_3bpep2,null,null,null,1437526787,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

**Me:** If he can work only 15 minutes a day, and even then not reliably, that is considered good enough to put them in the WRAG?

**Her:** Yes, if he can do *any amount of work* then you are put in the WRAG, even at home work counts.

**Me:** No offence but he is basically unemployable. Can you think of any job in the current market that would have an unreliable 15 minute a day employee, even at home or volunteer?

**Her:** Not really.

I think she knew it was a farce but had to go through the motions anyway; after five appointments you don't have to see them again, but i've heard they are changing that now.

One of the biggest problems with our defense is positioning, whether it be centerbacks or wingbacks, we are very prone to being caught out of position. After watching Ilori play for Portugal's U21 team and his performances last season, it seems as though his strongest quality is positioning. He always seems to be in the right place at the right time; just watch Portugal's semi-final for an example of what I'm talking about. This is also not to mention he's stupid fast, breaking Cristiano Ronaldo's sprinting record at Lisbon, strong, a good tackler, and very good with the ball at his feet.

Actually not that hard to do. The last BBC content I consumed was the 6 nations and even that was recorded and not live.

&gt;Also would say that scoring for fun in the Dutch league is a far cry from doing it in the Prem. Plenty of players have good World Cups and score in lower leagues, move to a tougher environment and fall off the radar.

null,false,uncrnd,null,null,null,"OK I'm reading the 'profile section' now.

Remove 'I am' - or 'he is' - in general on the CV.  It takes up space and it's obvious who you're talking about ;)

You have good experience, not vast - vast would imply you've been at it for years and years!  You also need to focus less on soft skills because all you're doing is saying you have them, not how you got them.  Anyone can write 'I am a team player' on their CV, it's not really measurable.  But if you say more like 'I am a team player having worked on a team of 10 to staff the shelves at a very busy period at xmas requiring us to support each other' (or whatever) then you can back this up.  This also goes for your interviews.  Hard facts and figures sound better.

I would write your profile more like this:

Confident and hardworking individual with experience in customer facing environments in both a corporate and retail setting.  Degree study was combined with part time work with a range of well-known brands, gaining a 2:1 and developing excellent communication skills.

Some general tips from the rest of it - 

Have an idea of how to explain your frequent moving.  If they were contracts, fine, if they were part time or summer jobs, also fine.  But you will want to have a good stint somewhere permanent because otherwise people will think you're a job hopper and won't want to interview you - recruitment and onboarding cost time and money and there's no point if you'll be gone in 6 months.

You don't need to write all your GCSEs out.  At this stage in your career they only care that you got A*-C and that includes Maths and English Language.

Bullet point your interests, don't write them out.

Don't bother with the references bit, everyone knows.

The one piece of advice I have for anyone, and if you take anything away from this thread, is this:

WRITE IN BULLETS NOT FULL SENTENCES.

I have 50 CVs to read and I know 80% at least are going to be irrelevant.  You are just one in the pile.  I want to know asap if I should put you forward.  If i's in bullets, I know quickly. It also looks cleaner.

In total, by not buying the Daily Fail and getting a TV license instead, you could save Â£135.30. The Daily Mail is almost twice as expensive as the TV license, and you get far less decent content.

edit: This is a good idea, I think you should keep this going for the other players.

Martin Skrtel is very interesting player to me as I progressive seem to dislike him and like him at the very same time.

Since he joined in 2008, I wouldn't say there has been a season when I've spotted his name in the starting 11 and been confident that he'd do a great job. He of course has his good attributes, and this isn't to say he isn't a good footballer, but he personally doesn't give me confidence.

Whilst he's been here, I'd say his best work has been in the 2014-15 season during the time we used him as the central defender in a  three at the back, he showed he can command his defence to do well in front of their keeper (the fact that Liverpool didn't concede an away goal in the league from Christmas to April is a magnificent achievement from the defence). He's also proven himself to be quite good at making a challenge when it is most needed and puts himself on the line if it can be for the good of the team.

In his 7 years at the club, the Slovakian captain has proven that he is a danger from set pieces, scoring 17 goals in his time. Mostly proven in the 2013-14 season in which he scored 8 goals (which made him the top scoring defender in the Premier League that season) which is very impressive considering his position where his attacks 95% of the time will come from corners.

Springing onto his 9th season at Anfield and now the 2nd longest serving player at the club (After Lucas Leiva), the 30 year old has shown a massive amount of loyalty to the club. It's very rare these days especially in the top leagues to see a footballer stay at a football club for a long period of time, especially with the drop Liverpool have had since he joined, he could have easily left for somebody who had constant Champions League football, but has stayed and helped the club.

However despite this, in his time at Liverpool he has also proven himself to be very susceptible to making errors which come costly to the club and results. This of course can happen to anyone, but it feels as if it happens a lot to Martin.

As part of this, in recent years it's felt as if he has taken the role over from Jamie Carragher as a player who is likely to score an own goals (he recently got the unfortunate Premier League record for most own goals in a Premier League season with 4 in 2013-14)

Whenever he's in a four at the back, it just feels like he can be dragged out of position quite easily (which might be why he works better in a 3 at the back has he would have two covers) and has let to teams taking advantage of this and proceeding to find the back of the net.

Skrtel also has quite a big history of causing heart attacks with Liverpool fans with some of his antics within our own box with things like handballs, dragging shirts, etc. And sure whilst thankfully he's never really been caught over it, it would be much preferred if it just didn't happen.

In my overall opinion, I feel that Martin Skrtel is a player who can be of very good use to Liverpool and is probably one of the best we can have currently, but I would much rather be in a position where he is the 3rd choice defender and can bring on if needed to tighten up or even need a goal.

TL/DR - Pros: Set pieces, does good in a three at the back, important tackles, experience and loyalty.

Cons - Prone to mistakes, can be lead out of position easily, doesn't do as good in a four at the back, own goals and a bit to hands on in our own box.",null,0,null,1435858376,null,0,1435858829,0,csq2cww,null,t3_3bvwum,null,t1_csq2cww,null,t3_3bvwum,null,null,null,1437528690,null,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12,null

And Zuculini still didn't start for them most of he time he was there and when he did, he was poor. 

I also had a chuckle when you put ""earned him a _half season loan to valencia_ when it was a season long loan they cut short because he was just dead weight. You worded it very optimistically for him haha.

Not really sure why to make of it, because he _did_ look decent in preseason. Maybe we'll get a PL loan for him next season and get a better understanding of what went wrong. From the sounds of it he's been enjoying the footballer lifestyle too much and forgotten the football part of it. 

What I will say though is that I'm 95% confident he won't be our 4th choice midfielder next season even if we don't buy one. He's not HG, he's over 21 and there's not a hope in hell he's going to take one of the 17 foreign player spots over any of our current players, even Fernando. Not unless he turns into Vieira reincarnate on the preseason tour.

Coutinho makes the wrong decision a lot more, as seen by the ridiculous amount of possession he wastes with his shots every season. Seriously 103 shots in 35 league games, that's more than Sterling with him being played as a striker.. Sterling has created more chances than Coutinho over the last 2 seasons simply because he wastes less of the ball than Coutinho does.


&gt;Additionally, Coutinho has moments of absolute magic. Did you see that backheel volleyed lob last season? That trickery and just out of the box thinking is something Sterling can't do, its why I rate him higher.

So something Coutinho does about 3 times a season makes a big impact in your decision? 

&gt;Â£27m for Bony, and Â£20m for Sterling; that's a difference of Â£7 million. Take into account City overpay, January window tends to have inflated prices and Bony is a better player, that's a very reasonable difference between the two. It's not double, as you said.

Well yea, but Â£15m*2 is  Â£30m.. so close :p

&gt;We just bought Firmino for Â£22m not including add ons, Bony went for Â£27m and he's a better player as mentioned above, Jovetic went for Â£22m and he had better seasons for Fiorentina than Raheem has ever had with us while City is also a club that tends to overpay. Navas was also signed for Â£15m and he was an absolute monster at Sevilla for years before he justified that price tag. There are many alternatives of similar current, or perhaps better, ability to Sterling that have been signed in the past. Â£15-20m for Sterling is a very accurate price in my opinion for him, if his current level of play is his limit.

Why not include addons? it's likely we'll hit them. So it's Â£29m.  Jovetic being better is arguable. 13 goals in 31 games in Serie A is pretty bad, not that far from Borini's record of 9 in 24 about 4 seasons ago. I don't think Navas was ever going to go for much more than that due to his goalscoring record always being shit/average.. there aren't many other examples are there?

You're really underrating Sterling, I bet if he was Brazillian and did some fancy flicks you'd be all over him though.

So for the top 3 leagues that get 4 CL slots, the top 3 (4**-1**=3) make the group stage. The 4th team starts at the playoff round. Now moving a tier down to the leagues with 3 CL spots (Italy, Portugal, France). The first 2 (3**-1**=2) make the group stage, but the 3rd-placed team makes the playoff round or lower*. This is the case with Monaco, probably because Ligue 1 is the lowest-ranked of the 3 leagues with 3 CL spots. 

There are also other details, like Spain getting 5 spots because of Sevilla winning EL and stuff like that. But that's a basic way to look at it. It's why you'll usually see a different colour on the league tables denoting things like CL/EL spots.

Cool. I disagree.

&gt;This whole 'error prone' stuff is complete bullshit in my opinion.

He made 5 statistically significant defensive errors in league play last season and 3 in Champions League play and 1 in Europa League play. You can look it up yourself on Squawka. Doesn't even count the times he was out of position (which was often). That's why you see him having to do hollywood tackles all the time.

Redfield also seems to have an extraordinarily large number of hairdressing salons / barbers. It's kinda weird.

The pubs are working-people's pubs mainly, so don't expect too much hipster shit... perhaps with the exception of *Grounded*, which is nice.

Supermarkets....Aldi. Can't go wrong with that, although there's a Tesco here too. There's a large Polish community here, so there's lot of nice Polish supermarkets too. There's also a few health stores, organic wholefood shops.

Links to the centre are easy. Bus lines on either side of the Park and the cycle path is just a stone's throw. To be honest, a brisk walk can  take you into the centre in about 30 minutes.

My issue with the previous post was that it gave absolutely no credit to Rodgers, which is completely unfair. How much credit he should get is something the fanbase will never agree on, but it's just silly to say he deserves none (I realise this is not what you're saying).


As for premier league flops, Ukrainian Premier League all-time top scorer [Sergi Rebrov] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serhiy_Rebrov#Dynamo_Kyiv) scored 93 in 186 games for Dynamo Kyiv and impressed in the CL before moving to Tottenham and scoring 10 in 60. On loan at West Ham he scored 1 in 27.


His teammate [Andriy Shevchenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Shevchenko) scored 60 in 117 appearances for Kyiv, 127 in 208 for AC Milan winning the CL and the Ballon d'Or, moved to Chelsea and scored 9 in 48 before moving back on loan to Milan. Serie A, especially back in that time period, was miles ahead of the Eredivisie.

Not a prolific goalscorer but [Juan Sebastian Veron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Ver%C3%B3n) was considered one of the best players in the world when he signed for a record English transfer fee from Lazio to Manchester United. After an impressive World Cup in 1998 he earned a move to Parma for Â£15m, then on to Lazio where he [helped his team to a treble and their first title in 25 years](http://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2015/mar/30/sven-goran-eriksson-lazio-serie-a-1999-2000-mancini-milan). He stayed with United for two years before moving to Chelsea, where he was equally unimpressive. From his wiki:
&gt;The Times listed VerÃ³n's transfers to Manchester United and Chelsea amongst the 50 worst transfers ever in Premiership history.[19] His several big-money transfers made VerÃ³n then the most expensive footballer in history with a cumulative total of Â£77 million at that time.

Resource shortages are very real, and just because they're not going to end with Mad Max doesn't mean they're going to be painless. I can point to a number of places right now that are suffering chronic water shortages, for example. Life goes on, but the residents of Australia and California will hardly tell you that everything is hunky-dory. 

E: I still fail to see how you can argue this while at the same time arguing that scarcity is real and the Greens just don't get it. Are you trying to say that money is scarce but resources aren't? In that case, what do you think quantitative easing is?

Unmanaged economic growth certainly doesn't do anything to prevent wealth accumulating in the hands of the already wealthy. In a constantly growing economy, it's not particularly difficult to make a reliable return on investment of ~7-10% per year (diversifying investments across the entire market, as index funds do, is a good way of achieving this). As with any investment, this still constitutes taking a risk, but when you make these sorts of investments you're effectively playing at a casino where the deck is stacked in your favour. You and I can play at this same game, sure - as long as we're patient and rational and educated, and we have enough savings to our names to make it worth it (which a lot of people *don't*, through no fault of their own). But when you have hundreds of millions of pounds and nothing better to do with them, your returns are proportionally greater, and you get proportionally richer - for doing no work more productive than gambling when the odds are in your favour, or, more to the point, precisely no more work than you or I if we had made the same choices with our own, much less substantial capital.

I'm sure in some circumstances it does. If you're a single person under the age of 35, it most likely doesn't. In my neck of the woods an average 1 bedroom flat costs anywhere from Â£300 - Â£325 PCM. Housing benefit will pay Â£260.00. Assuming a 10% reduction in the amount of LHA / Housing Benefits, that'd mean that for the most basic [and god lord almighty they are basic!] damp and infested hovel, a person would need to supplement their rent by Â£66 per month.

In addition, that is, to the increased contribution towards council tax - previously covered entirely, it was changed a few years ago, with local councils able to allocate which groups contribute what - so your pensioners obviously pay nothing; those on unemployment benefits now typically pay 10 - 15% of the monthly cost. It might only be ~Â£10 per month, but combined with the above noted Â£66 per month short fall, that's a combined reduction in welfare each month of Â£77 - or approximately 26%.

And I agree he doesn't have the talents maybe to start everyweek for a top 4 club, but when has that stopped Arsenal or Liverpool for example by signing reletively cheap strikers with limited talents? Lol, Liverpool signed Danny Ings ffs, haha.

Yes but how has that worked in their favor to win things? 

&gt;And what's your opinons on where we need to stregthen to seriously be in the mix for winning the CL?

To be honest I don't think we need to strengthen anything to be a serious contender. I think we are already that. But it does make sense to buy world class talent to push our starting players and who knows maybe find one that is even better than our starters. It wouldn't hurt to add a player who can play CDM and CM. And add a CAM that can also play LM. Also find a Centerback that can play parts of the season and be a good prospect to be a future starter. Terry played outstanding but we won't be able to keep asking him to play at that high of quality. Our strikers will be fine this season. But really if we don't strengthen any of that and try out some youth I still think our Core team can play for the CL.

The equivalent would be flying the union flag in the Republic. 

Not quite, you were talking about Alliance being hypocrites for not responding the same way in Nationalist councils and I asked what you meant, one of the things I thought you might mean was they were flying tricolors. You still haven't explained what exactly you meant if they weren't flying the tricolor? 


I do see flying the tricolor as the same though .As a Nationalist interested in peace I would think it's would be incredibly moronic to fly it however because of how so many people who live here don't recognise it, and so we think the same should apply to Unionism and the Union flag, in the interest of shared peace. Not one single SDLP or Sinn Fein politician has even uttered the phrase 'tricolour' when it comes to what we should fly on the City Hall  .

That to me sounds like an exact replacement for Higgy, to be honest. Higgy was incredible for the second half of his first season for us, and mediocre at best for the other parts with anonymity thrown in every so often. 

Also checked Carlisle forums, and this matches up with what Carlisle fans are saying: they've been mince for 2 years.

Altogether lets say it brings in about Â£40-45 million. EDIT: I'll even sell Remy for Â£20 million seeing as Griezmann can be the 2nd striker if need be and we bring back Traore for free

Now I buy Begovic (6million), Stones, Verratti (for Â£60 million) and Griezmann for Â£43 million . Its a bit over 100 million but I think I cover the cost of Stones and the 3 million for Griezmann with my players sold and I buy Baba for 18 million (euros)

I play 3 fast defenders at the back FIFA style and make Roman the money back by building a team so dominant it wins 3 champions leagues in a row and dominates England for years. We then get a huge influx of support in the middle east which naturally catapults shirt sales and other merchandise items. Remember we keep the current players so we have the option to play 4 at the back and have CB depth with Terry and Cahill also Ivanovic for RB

How can you say Ibe is more composed? Based on what exactly? A comparison between the two is pointless as the sample size for Ibe is too small. A comparison is also ludicrous because Sterling's resume is far better. 

Of course Ibe would have more stats if he played more, in a better Liverpool team, and with better players. But, you have nothing to back that with. Ibe hasn't won the Golden Boy award, he doesn't have the appearances or return in the PL, and he isn't an established England international. You can't just assume that Ibe would be better if they were switched. Doesn't work like that.

It IS NOT a law. REPEAT: NOT A LAW.

The EU Commission (which proposes new laws - the European Parliament has no ""legislative initiative"", it passes laws proposed by the Commission, it can't propose laws itself) is currently poised to write new copyright legislation to deal with some of the problems that have arisen in the internet age. They will consider the report when they draft any new laws, but are not bound by any of it's findings.

This amendment was proposed and pushed through the small committee by Jean-Marie Cavada - a French MEP. France is pretty much the only place in Europe without Freedom of Panorama.

There's basically no way the EU Commission (which consists of professional law writers - not clueless MEPs) is going to suggest the entire EU harmonises with France.

He struggled this year, pretty much across the board, yet he still acted like he was banging in goals on the regular and expected the same treatment and reaction from the fans.

I often have this thought when I watch Sterling - would he be worth a shit if he wasn't 20 years old and extremely fast? He's not clever, he's not particularly smart, he doesn't have a great touch or a great shot, he doesn't have great decision-making, but yes he's good at taking people on 1v1 and trying to run past or around people. Speed will leave him (sooner rather than later), and even now good defenders can simply give him the space they need to keep up because Sterling is not creative or intelligent enough to take advantage of that space (or at least he hasn't shown that he is, [as Coutinho has](http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/LWqHhdTbemRthx2UoFAaLg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NQ--/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2015-02-22/a03b2320-bab3-11e4-90b8-055d38e1be64_premierleague.gif)). In my opinion, this is a big reason for his decline - once defenders got used to his speed and didn't have to focus on Suarez, Sterling's ability to impact matches was reduced considerably.

You realise that even animals understand deferred consumption right? Birds have been observed taking bread and using it as fish bait.

&gt;Except perhaps we should be making some sort of concession to those who aren't buying to let, but buying to own. 

I've mentioned it before, rental income on tax returns used to be Schedule A. It is still treated differently before lumped into to incomes. Dividends are currently considered as top slice income as dividends are un-earned income and therefore every other form of income is considered first. A stroke of the pen could change rental income and all other un-earned incomes to the top slice. This defers rent seeking and encourages wealth creation, land lording isn't wealth creation of course.

&gt;When landlords group money together to buy a house that lets them scalp younger people because they have nowhere else to turn, then it's a problem.

Which is why I've often said unofficial settlements ought to be allowed, but many people have a terribly negative image of shanty towns. Â£10K would buy you two 1TEU shipping containers you can stack them and probably build a fairly decent dwelling in them. But the government recently outlawed squatting and crush any unofficial settlement site.

Ahem. Politically charged, I rest my case your honour.

Btw, most nationalists do recognise the state of the United Kingdom, NI being a member nation. You're an exception.

&gt;Not quite, you were talking about Alliance being hypocrites for not responding the same way in Nationalist councils and I asked what you meant, one of the things I thought you might mean was they were flying tricolors. You still haven't explained what exactly you meant if they weren't flying the tricolor?

Nationalist dominated councils fail to observe designated days. If designated days was to be the compromise, then why is it only Belfast that needs to compromise? Simple reason - Alliance failure to look away from their target seats which made their stance as politically motivated as anyone else in flag gate.

&gt;As a Nationalist interested in peace I would think it's would be incredibly moronic to fly it however because of how so many people who live here don't recognise it

Lol sorry but you talk of jurisdiction as if it's a state of mind. It's not.

Wrong again. Many councils across the UK observe 365 day flag flying.

You don't have extremely creative play that can come from either wing (see Navas all the time, Nasri the second half of the year). Even when it's working, it does leave the central midfield a bit open against most opponents. Although it's proven in the past, I think in 14-15 we saw some teams really figure it out, and the team indisputably played better the first half of the year when they also happened to be playing 4-2-3-1. All of that makes me think we should be playing 4-2-3-1. 

That makes me think that Bony was an unwise signing last year in a bit of injury-induced desperation that once everyone was healthy again opened up the opportunity for MP to play the 4-2-2-2. The unreasonably stubborn way he stuck with it after it was clearly not working well and the team needed a big change was the most frustrating part of last season and in my opinion is a big reason Chelsea pulled away in 2015.  

At this point, I'd be looking to offload Dzeko and either convert Jovetic to someone who can play in the 3 below the striker (he's got some creativity) or sell him as well, and keep Bony as the second top-class striker a team with serious European and Cup ambitions will need. 

I agree that we are not going to buy the world. In fact, I think we can fix 4-2-3-1 with the same three signings you identify. We clearly need at least one starting quality wide player. If we're playing either 4-2-3-1 or 4-2-2-2 he needs to have considerable creative qualities. That's why I'd much, much prefer KDB over Sterling. Sterling makes more sense to me in a true 4-3-3. If Nasri doesn't recover his form, we may need a second wide player in the Winter window. We need a CM. Personally, I would pencil in Fernandinho as a starter and Yaya as a rotating man, hoping we can get a starting caliber CM. And lastly we need a young-ish quality LB to shore up the defense further. 

3 key transfers. The one I haven't heard many rumors about lately is the LB. 

If Pellegrini sticks with his 4-2-2-2 to begin the season, I suppose I can accept that with (hopefully) important new pieces after the transfer window. However, if it's not working and he keeps sticking with it, I'll be near the front of the line to turn up the heat on his job. Good managers find systems that suit their players well and get results, they don't stubbornly insist on their preferred system after it's clearly not working.

His tactical awareness and intelligent use of space? Not so much... His ruthless finishing in front of goal? As if... His excellent decision making and awareness? Nice try...

Again all I'm left with is beating players 1v1 by getting them a bit off balance then blowing past them with speed. Admittedly, he is *very* good at this. But he won't be able to do this forever, because a) Sterling will lose pace soon enough, and b) he's not as accomplished at wrong-footing defenders as Suarez for example (meaning Sterling needs more pace to get past defenders, which he won't have). This is also a very one dimensional game which can be pretty well shut down by intelligent defending - which is what we saw this weekend.

Another problem is his technical ability. With BR we need to start offense with good passing at the back and neither Migs nor Skrtel are good passers. With only Migs, Skrtel, and sakho in the back triangle, we have too much liability. It worked in a back three because of the extra man to pass too, but doesn't in a back two with Skrtel.

If 'the left' thinks that the terrorism is justified, then obviously they don't think that the reason behind it is dumb savagery and a lack of self-control. Also, even many conservative sources celebrate Nelson Mandela, terrorist, so the idea that terrorism is only acceptable to 'the left' isn't really convincing.

Have you seen Sakho play?

The argument for the BBC having any influence over ITV's advertising practices holds no weight whatsoever. The truth is that the old school channels are a dying breed but at least ITV has the decency to fund itself. All you have to do is to look at Netflix and Amazon Prime to see that people are willing to pay for (ad free) content - if you were to subscribe to them both then the annual cost would be comparable to the licence but the added convenience of being truly on demand.

&gt;

&gt;The phrase ""cold enough to freeze the balls off (or *on*) a __brass monkey__"" is a [colloquial expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquial_expression) used by some [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) speakers. The reference to the [testes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle) (as the term *balls* is commonly understood to mean) of the [brass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass) monkey appears to be a 20th-century variant on the expression, prefigured by a range of references to other body parts, especially the nose and tail.

&gt;During the 19th and 20th centuries, small [monkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey) cast from the alloy [brass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass) were very common tourist [souvenirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souvenir) from [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) and [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan). They usually, but not always, came in a set of three representing the [Three Wise Monkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Wise_Monkeys) carved in wood above the Shrine of [Toshogu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshogu) in NikkÅ, Japan. These monkeys were often cast with all three in a single piece. In other sets they were made singly. Although three was the usual number, some sets of monkeys added a fourth, with its hand covering its [genitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitals). Old brass monkeys of this type are collectors' items.   [Michael Quinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Quinion), advisor to [The Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oxford_English_Dictionary) and author of *World Wide Words* says ""Itâs more than likely the term came from them"".

We seem to have just as many adverts on independent channels as American TV, considering an episode of say Dexter takes an hour to watch on both sides of the Atlantic. And hasn't the BBC's vaunted impartiality been repeatedly called into question in recent years? Certainly the BBC seems to have a self protective tendency to support the status quo that with accusations over the last few years demonstrates it is at best inept and at worst corrupt?

The thing is, I am not generally anti BBC, no more than I am pro or anti any channel. What I am against is the growth of the television licence to encompass other forms of media. By the letter of this webpage:

http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/technology--devices-and-online-top8

I would require a TV license for my household in order to watch Scott Manley broadcast kerbal space program live from his house in California via twitch.TV on my mobile using 3G whilst on a ferry in the middle of lake Windermere (I would also be very fortunate with my connection). Does that not seem somewhat outside the remit of the TV licence to you?

*admittedly I might be being a little hyperbolic with twitch.TV, however the page explicitly says ""online-only TV services"" but fails to define exactly what that is. Forcing a liberal definition for those that wish to comply with the regulations.

The main difference to those products you mentioned. Are that our prime focus is to enable deep analytical research into the providers complete financials, assets administered, funds available and charges / company / fund structures. That are regularly updated in realtime directly from providers.
 
Ideally it will be a one-stop shop for the whole research and risk process. With no need to leave the application or pick-up the phone to contact providers with realtime fund manager commentary also. Making the research experience as simple as Duedil.com made accessing and analysing financial information on companies.

For us it is about creating greater clarity and simpler access to deeper information on Wraps &amp; Platforms for advisors. And a far more interactive lead generation and support process for providers. Within a strictly no advertising based based business model.

null,false,SongsOfDragons,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,null,"**Data:**

* Country - GB stands for Great Britain, which geographically is the largest island in out little archipelago off the coast of Europe. Technically it only counts England, Scotland and Wales and forgets Northern Ireland, which is on the second largest island. The UK is the technically better initialism for our country, but the reason GB is considered equal in use is because both the United Kingdom and Ukraine wanted the 'UK' icon, and GB and U were agreed on as a compromise.

* Place Name - Stechford and Yardley North is a ward in Birmingham, making up part of a constituency. I did have to look that one up as I wasn't sure. We have lots and lots of little subdivisions here XD

* State - I suppose the four constituent countries could be considered states...No, generally I wouldn't say they're used in addresses, unless there would be confusion over borders etc.

* Community - Um...That may well be a city.

* E something - Google leads me to the ONS, the Office for National Statistics. Possibly this and the last categories, or in fact most of these, are to do with data collection and analysis, and not for addresses.

**Equivalents:**

* Street - In America your numbers go up into the thousands, and your streets are all laid out in neat grid patterns, turning an address into a city co-ordinate as it were. In the UK our numbers start at 1, or 2, then go up sequentially (3, 5, 7... or 4, 6, 8...) on opposite sides of the street. Sometimes they are boustrophedon numbered (starts at 1 at one end, goes up and around the street to finish at e.g. 27 at the other) or can be bizarre, starting at 3, going to 6, 6a, 6b, then 8, 10, 11, 12, before ending at 20. This can happen when old roads are intersected or the houses adjusted. Some don't even have numbers, they're named instead. Our street names are not sequential, twist and turn everywhere, have no bearing on where in the city/town it is, and can be named all sorts of things with names like Street, Lane, Road, Way, Gardens, Close, Row, Crescent, Drive, Terrace, Avenue, named as one chooses.

* City - Is a settlement. You have the big ones like Birmingham or Southampton which are actually cities, then large non-cities like Reading or Middlesborough, towns like Newbury or Chesterfield, and other small towns or villages. Cities in this country are cities because they have been granted said status by Letters Patent from the monarch - not because they have a cathedral or a university. Town statuses etc are more nebulous. Sometimes small places will have an extra line in their address saying they are 'near XXXtown'.

* County - We have counties. A lot of them end in '-shire'. Some are very big, some are very small. They are administrative boundaries that cover wide areas. Many major cities are now unitary authorities, which are better suited for urban areas, sit outside county council control but for all intents and purposes they are similar to counties. A subdivision of a county is generally the same as the city above (the borough council, for example) but in some cases (London?) you might need to know the name of the borough itself (e.g. Hackney, Camden).

* State - As I said above, generally the country (England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland) don't get on our addresses. That's probably mostly because we're a lot smaller than the US. I think three UKs fit into Texas alone...

* Zip - We call them Postcodes. They're not just numbers; you can look at a postcode and figure out approximately where it is. They are divided into two sections, outward and inward: the postal area, and where within the postal area. The outward code consists of one or two letters then some numbers; the letters generally refer to a major town, but sometimes they don't (London's are all compass directions). B is Birmingham. The numbers then refer to a district within the area, so wherever 33 is. The inward code, 8BB, then directs the post further within the district, referring to a particular street or group or properties, or even a single property like a tower block.

This is what happens when you try and make sense of higgledy-piggledy UK over the course of several centuries...XD Many addresses can be written in multiple ways, especially in small areas, rural places or places close to borders. Just get the postcode right, and the number/name of the house, and you should be okay to post them something...unless you're visiting and using a satnav, in which case be watchful as sometimes the postcode can lead you far away from where you want to be.

I work in this field.

http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/1141/ - A good low-level walk for bad weather.
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/3234/ - As above, but with a little hill.
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/1142/ - Very pretty but a pain to get to from Windermere (where we usually stay.)
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/1565/ - A longer wet day walk. We often combine it with the Rydal Sheep Dog trials in August.
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/1463/ - another good low-ish one for when the clouds are in.

Higher ones that want better weather to enjoy most (not that there's anything wrong with being up there on your own in the cloud!)
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/1356/ - The crags themselves are really pretty as is the walk.
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/2036/ - Can get really busy on very good days but has amazing views.
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/1171/ - Excellent walk that I keep meaning to go back to when it's not blowing half a gale and driving rain. That's if I can convince the rest of the group...
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/2841/ - Great walk. The tarn is awesome for swimming/paddling in!
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/1235/ - Another awesome Tarn walk :)

Getting into the better part of a day long walks now :)

http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/3110/ - The walk is well worth it for the old man, The rest makes it into a real epic :)
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/1241/ - Loadpot hill is really interesting with lots of old mines and whatnot to explore. Different walking to the rest of the lakes.

The big 'uns. Full days of walking, you've earneda  pie and a pint at the end of it!
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/1002/ - The Fairfield horseshoe. One big horse-shoe shaped ridge with several wainrights on the up to and down from Fairfield, the biggest peak in the middle. A really great hike!
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/2652/ - another epic hike. Like the better known Fairfield horse shoe this is a big up then down in the classic shape. I prefer this one as I think the ridge Froswick-Ill Bell-Yoke is simply spectacular.
http://walkingbritain.co.uk/walks/walks/walk_a/1911/ - an amazing walk that I had to abandon due to poor weather on the tops. Must get back and finish one day...

null,false,listyraesder,null,null,null,"I'm sorry, but that is just not true. For one thing, the BBC is the biggest broadcaster in the world, with 200,000 employees in over 50 sites around the world. BBC News alone creates over 100 hours of content *every day*. While all major UK broadcasters went tapeless-delivery early this year, it was a long road to get there. 

At the time DMI started, there was no existing solution. The BBC either had to have separate systems for archive, production, news, new media and radio, or had to design one from scratch. As the point was to allow news producers to dig into the archive at will, or for radio to access tv news etc, the latter had to take place.

By the time DMI collapsed, the first integrated systems were starting to come on the market, partly to fill demand started by the BBC scheme. 

You make the mistake of trying to compare tapeless feature film production with tapeless broadcast TV. Yes, the end result of both is pretty moving lights with sound accompaniment, just like apples and oranges are both sort of spherical fruits. 

Features are dealt with in closed-ended pipelines on networks where there is normally no access from outside the building. They use single-purpose software and hardware to do a limited number of things to a finite amount of data over an extended period of time. 

In broadcast, you may need to record something in a studio in Glasgow, send it to an edit suite in Manchester for post, where they'll pull up news archive from down in London, record narration from a radio studio in Bristol and then send it to the playout facility in London all in the space of a few hours.

There is no mention of whom that property should belong to, which leaves open the defence that you broke one piece of a person's property in order to save another piece of that person's property.

As this is a defence in law, the burden is on you as the defendant to prove that the danger to the property you were trying to save was immediate, and that your actions were reasonable under the circumstances.  There is no need for your belief to be correct or even reasonable, it just has to be honestly held (i.e. You are still protected from consequence if your motionless dog turns out to be a pile of rags, or already dead, as long as you honestly believed it was a dog in immediate need of rescue). 

However, as I always counsel when asked this question, being immune from criminal consequence does not make you immune from physical injury when the vehicle's 24-stone 6'6"" owner sees you smashing his window.  Additionally, police only need reasonable grounds to suspect you have committed an offence in order to arrest you, so if you do an act like this, the police may still lawfully arrest you for it, even if you would never be convicted at court.

A guy who looked exactly like him walked by towards the exit...he wore an expensive-looking white button-down short-sleeve shirt with many visible tattoos. He had a few similarly-dressed friends walking out with him. 

I did a double take, but dismissed it because he was so fucking short. A bit later I googled him and found out that he's actually only 5'9. I initially estimated I was 4-6 inches taller than this doppelganger and surely the imposing Tom Hardy couldn't be that short, but it turns out he is indeed that short. 

It was one of those mock British pubs that shows all the football matches every week, but I still don't think he'd have any reason to be in Minneapolis last year. Some research tells me that Tom Hardy doesn't even like football. 

I gotta be honest, I don't even really like Tom Hardy all that much...I probably wouldn't have even said anything to him if it was him. I just need to fucking know if it was him. It was probably just some meat head with a tribal tattoo and a polo shirt getting ready to go home and play some Call of Duty, but this will haunt me forever.

Fourthly, Baba is nowhere near Chelsea quality. If Luis isn't going to get games Baba won't, and if we do buy him he'll end up as another Bertrand and just sit on the bench or on loan until we sell him. Rudinger is better, but still not great.

Fifthly, your transfers leaves us with one RB, one GK, a young second-choice LB who's only top-level experience has been with Ausberg, and four attacking midfielders, of which our best two are by and away best starting on the left of the pitch.

The back five pick themselves. Questions about Howard and Robles exist, certainly, but Howard is the better keeper in my mind. If we pick up Ospina, though, he goes straight into my starting XI, and fuck the fact that I'm an American. Garbutt's defensive quality is not where it needs to be for a team challenging for Europe. I'd much prefer to see him out at Bournemouth and regularly starting with Galloway and Oviedo around for cover as needed. 

Macca is an obvious choice in the middle, and based on how Gaz played the last three months of last season, I want him starting next to Macca. I don't think his style fits well with Mo.

I've got Cleverly in attack because almost all of the criticism that's been leveled at Cleverly has been from when he's played in a deeper, holding role. He really shone under Sherwood at Villa because Sherwood played him as an advanced playmaker/inside forward type player, similar to what Stevie P played so well.  We need some direct running in attack, hence Kev/Geri on the right, and Ross in the center of the park. But we also need someone who can pick the defense apart against teams that will just sit back and challenge us to break them down. Ossie's pretty good at it, but he can't play 90 minutes week in-week out, so it's Cleverly.

And really, was there any question about who'd lead the line? Rom.

I think the biggest thing they need to improve on is their defensive shape and discipline. Their fullbacks especially need to improve that part of their game. Clyne could be a promising signing but he is used to playing in a system with 2 DM's so it didn't matter as much if he bombed forward as 1 of the DM's would have covered for him. At Liverpool it looks like they won't even play 1 DM. Also they don't really have much cover if one of them gets injured.  
They also need to have a plan B when the opponent has a packed defense. At the moment it looks like Rodgers has just told the team to take long shots if they're struggling to break through. 

I think in the transfer window they will try to get rid of some of their deadwood like Borini, Lambert, Balotelli and Enrique. I think they will try to buy another fullback for cover and it looks like Benteke as a different option for striker. Sterling will probably go as well. I think they should try and get in another DM for cover to Lucas but I don't think Rodger's believes in DM's. 

I think they will do better than this season. I don't think they'll make the top 4 unless one of the other teams under perform. Just looking at their signings shows that they are the level below the top 4. They are good signings for Liverpool but would be average to poor for the rest of the top 4. Firmino being the only good one.

We've barely even scratched the surface, quite literally. Some elements are of course rarer than others but even so we're talking in the billions of tons with few, few exceptions. Rare earths aren't even rare, its just a name that stuck. Real rare materials are likely to be harvested from asteroids within the century or so, in that case especially it will not cause shortages on Earth. We have absolutely no problem with water resources in western nations, distribution and in extreme cases desalination can easily solve any shortages.

I would argue that resources issues are almost exclusively an issue for the third world where they lack the capital and human resources to get around the lack of natural and mineral resources they have.

Scarcity is effectively our limited human capacity to produce and use what we have. It is not limited by natural resources especially if you consider we can effectively grow petrol. Metals and such are effectively unlimited, the scarcity comes from the inability to process large quantities without great effort. Not sure why you're tying money printing (also known as QE) into it though.

I think its on you to prove that economic growth actually directly causes wealth instability. A society with a broadly equal strata of income, perhaps a more socialist leaning country such as in Scandinavia still has growth while having a more equal society economically.

Is it really such a bad thing that people can actually make money from moving money around? Someone who makes a poor investment that is to a bad cause or an unprofitable venture will lose his money. The system rewards success and punishes failure, a venture capitalist is a very helpful and necessary thing for businesses, small and large alike. I personally don't see anything wrong with it, the money had to come from somewhere in the first place and I'm glad that this system we have encourages money being held in the riches hands to be constantly and continuously reinvested. 

I have yet to really see a practical and level headed argument for zero or negative growth. Besides that point try selling the idea to the poor that they need to get even poorer than they are to help the system.",null,0,null,1435876470,null,0,false,0,csqdxif,null,t3_3bojsh,null,t1_csqdxif,null,t1_csq3r1v,null,null,null,1440503362,null,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0,null
null,false,nine8nine,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt;  I have allowed considerable latitude in this hearing in an attempt to unearth what has gone wrong. It has emerged that certain key facts are not in dispute and they are as follows.

&gt; Firstly, in 1988 the Crawfords took out an Endowment mortgage with Bradford &amp; Bingley with the capital advanced being Â£41,800.

&gt;Secondly, it has become clear that the endowment policy taken out at the same time as the loan has been surrendered or lapsed. Either way it is no longer available.

&gt;Thirdly, following the original mortgage loan of Â£41,800 the Crawfords took out a second loan in 1989. This was for Â£5,000 for home improvements and was repayable on a more conventional capital repayment and interest basis. There were thus two different types of mortgage accounts although both were secured against 3 Fearn Chase through the original mortgage deed.

&gt;Fourthly, the Crawfords were in discussion with Bradford &amp; Bingley about the lack of an endowment policy in 1999.

&gt;Fifthly, in 1999 Bradford &amp; Bingley offered to move the Crawfords to a repayment mortgage but the Crawfords refused. This is important because Mr Crawfordâs case has been that Bradford &amp; Bingley changed his mortgage to repayment without his agreement. Today the position has been clarified. It is clear that Bradford &amp; Bingley offered to convert the mortgage to repayment and it is agreed that Mr Crawford refused this. However Bradford &amp; Bingley did not unilaterally change the type of mortgage the Crawfords had. I observe that in many ways the refusal by Mr Crawford to take up a repayment mortgage has been the source of this problem.

 And that I think is the main thrust of the judgement.

So nothing really to see here. The banks aren't always evil and the little guy isn't always in the right. It's just a shame whatever caused him to stop paying the mortgage (which it looks like he could still afford, according to the judgement), has now lost him a house.",null,0,null,1435876480,null,0,false,0,csqdxor,null,t3_3bwews,null,t1_csqdxor,null,t3_3bwews,null,null,null,1437536137,null,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22,null

Can't tell much from his whoscored profile, however, some positive points:

* Has made 132 appearances for the top Belgian club (Anderlecht) at just age 21. A good sign that he's the real deal. 
* Has played Champions League 3 years in a row. 
* Young (21)
* 7.47 rating from his champions league matches against top opposition this season, garnering 1 goal and 2 assists in 6. (Galatasaray, Arsenal, Dortmund)
* Belgian international at every youth level, even 1 appearance for the full NT. 
* S'oton/Everton also after him. 


Looks like the real deal, although I'm not 100% sure where an attacking midfielder would fit into our squad given Grealish, Gil(sigh...), and N'zogbia(hope he's sold though). Looks like the 2nd one would be on the way out, and N'zogbia.... I dunno. Would we also be pulling out 9 or 10 million quid for this kid as well?

edit: though i want to add, i think Gomez should get a chance. IMO he will be a better player than Ilori. but to think that Ilori is gonna come in and turn into Varane is absurd. people are basing this off of his U21 performances and need to look at what he did at his loan club.

If you would rather have a candidate who is basically identical to the Tories you would probably be better off voting for the Tories.

&gt;2) People who think wanting to win makes you a Tory are a cancer to the Labour Party.

I am not a member of the Labour Party and have never voted for them and probably never will. I voted Green in the general election. I'm only interested in this because I would like to see an opposition party who aren't a carbon copy of the ruling party.
 
&gt;3) Not being Jeremy Corbyn doesn't mean you're a ""Red Tory"".

No, but the fact is that all of the other candidates are basically ripping off the Tories in an attempt to stay relevant. Some of them are even swallowing the retarded Tory ""Labour caused an international financial crisis"" bullshit.

&gt;4) Failing to appreciate the existence of a divergence from the narrow worldview of Corbyn's ridiculous, out-dated and politically suicidal brand of left wing thought is completely typical of Labour's hard left.

Again, i'm not a Labour voter or supporter but it's interesting how you seem to think that he is terrible yet during the last leadership debate his responses seemed to get the most positive reaction from the audience. It's clear that people liked what they heard from him.

&gt;5) The Labour Party achieved the most it ever has since Atlee under Blair, who was, I'd imagine, exactly what you stupidly describe as a Red Tory. The only way we'll ever have any influence again is for the left of the party to wake up and realise the country wants something positive.

Your mate will need to apply for a replacement V5, until this turns up you can't do much. If you are buying the bike or he's giving it to you he needs to send off the replacement V5 and give you the new keepers slip. Without this you wont be able to tax the bike. Police and petrol stations have ANPR to check for untaxed vehicles so riding it without tax isn't a good idea.
Insure it as soon as you have the V5, then make sure you pre-book an MOT test. You can ride it to an MOT station without tax or MOT but ONLY if it's pre-booked. If it passes you can then tax it and you're good to go.
If it fails the easiest thing to do would be just to get the tester to fix it so take it to a bike mechanic not just an MOT station, otherwise you'll need to collect it in a van and take it somewhere to be fixed.

It's a pain I know and I can see why people just don't bother and ride about without tax/mot/insurance

My point was that it is not difficult to avoid BBC consumption, not that I didn't consume. I do, though rarely, and I pay my TV licence as required by regulation.

&gt;challenge to a corporate worldview

And that was fine when the choice was BBC vs corporate channels. That is not the case any more. There are a plethora of effectively independent media sources for almost and demographic or target audience available online.

&gt;educating children is worth it

I Never said it wasnt

&gt;Do you object to paying for schools?

Not at all.

&gt;Are you happy for corporate interests to be the sole media influence for the nation's children?

The choice is by far greater than corporate vs BBC, and more importantly there is a huge difference between children's programmes and educational programmes.

For example with my hypothetical child I would by far rather go to you tube and use channels like smarter every day, scishow, crash course, veritasium and others than I would BBC programming. Channels that I can fund directly via sites like patreon, channels that are committed to producing educational content free, for all, for all time. Once upon a time the BBC was practically the sole provider for educational content. Those times have long since passed.

&gt;The changes made in the last decade are as a result of massive corporate pressure

And technological change. The licensing commission has made grand changes to licensing regulations in order to ensure that they can continue to justify the TV licence (however contrived the justification) as substantial swathes of the populations seek their media consumption through other means.

&gt;and a government that didn't like being called our who filled the trust with their cronies

If it has been filled with cronies it can no longer fulfil its function as being impartial and apolitical.

I agree, and that's why it needs to be either put to rest or massively overhauled. I would personally prefer it be trimmed down to a by far more lean state of core functionality and funded out if general taxation as a national asset than via poor attempts to continues to justify the licences existence by extending its mandate into domains it has no business being in.

Hah, as if this is a move toward a similar system. No this is a botch job that will shut the issue up long enough that it will be too late for people to realise that the Tories have effectively broke English democracy.

The problem with this bill is that representative democracy is a delicate balancing act. There are complicated procedures in play to ensure that the votes are allocated to seats in a way that ensure the closest to a fair outcome for the given population. 

Westminster parliament constituencies are balanced according to the population of the UK. If you look at say the Scottish parliament constituencies, they are different to the Westminster ones as they are balancing according to the population of the Scottish population. Same goes for the northern irish assembly, welsh assembly and london assembly.

This bill would effectively create a separate English mandate, without any of the democratic due process. People voted for a UK parliament and the seats that can vote in English matters were balanced for a UK-wide parliament. Nothing short of a full English parliament with English specific constituencies will be a solution to the Lothian question.

That the Tories are even presenting this solution is at best a dangerous display of incompetence and at worst dangerously corrupt. I am for EVEL-reform, but this plan risks creating a system that is even more broken than it currently is.

You're right, the Lothian question has been around for 38 years, so it just makes it even more shocking that what they came up with is some back of a fag packet solution that is fundamentally flawed, and would effectively destroy democratic process.",null,0,null,1435878870,null,0,false,0,csqf8u0,null,t3_3bvw8h,null,t1_csqf8u0,null,t1_csqao5k,null,null,null,1437537210,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

The fact they're probably looking to ban asymmetric encryption (it's more secure since only the person receiving the message has the key required to read the message) would result in SSL/TLS being unusable, so while your passwords stored on websites would be safe (since one-way hash functions most likely wouldn't be banned by this proposal), you'd be sending them, as well as your cookies, via an unencrypted connection every time you log in to a website, making it trivial for someone to snag your details with a Â£20 Wi-Fi adapter and some open-source software.

Someone with a good amount of patience can monitor your activity, waiting for you 
 to order something on Amazon in public or even in your own house (since most routers use WPA-2 out-of-the-box, which uses AES encryption for privacy between the router and the user's computer, which would be banned) and grab a copy of the webpage asking you to log in (which automatically fills in your email address if you ask Amazon to remember you) and the details you send back to log in (which is your email address and password, make sure your email account's password is different). Logging in and buying a ton of digital music, films and ebooks with a VPN using your debit/credit card details (which they either snatched if you entered them or you have saved to your account, doesn't matter either way really) is simple by that point. And that's just an Amazon account. If someone gets access to your email account this way they have everything they need to breach nearly every account tied to that email address. Use two-factor authentication if your accounts support it, it sends a text message to your phone with a single-use code, so if someone does end up with your password they still can't get into your account.

Also, speaking of phones, Android 5 and iOS 8 have device encryption enabled by default, so if you lose your phone or it gets stolen nobody can access the data on the device, like your emails, text messages, contact list, any saved addresses, calendar, visited locations or game high scores. If this thing actually somehow makes it into law that layer of security will be gone, so hopefully you don't have a calendar entry saying ""family holiday"" and your address saved in Google Maps.",null,0,null,1435879874,null,0,false,0,csqfsk8,null,t3_3bw2ss,null,t1_csqfsk8,null,t3_3bw2ss,null,null,null,1437537654,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Asfla is great too but only a small village near Goumina/Goulmim (can't remember which), possiblt by a place called Tadeghoust/Tadehroust (sp).

Of their starting lineup, I reckon only Sterling would break into some of the top 4 starting 11s. Coutinho realistically wouldn't make CAM for any of them, Sturridge would for Arsenal but if he played for them he'd be in a body-cast for 6years, maybe Hendo could break into Utds midfield and perhaps Clyne at Utd or Arsenal but thats literally it.

Their signings in Ings, Clyne, Firmino and Manquillo are that of a team happy with 5th place. I know this isnt a popular opinion but I'll be fucked if signing Milner should ever be considered phenomenal, ill let you have the words useful, versatile, solid and homegrown but thats all you're getting.  

Other than that great post. However, unless Rodgers gets this team playing as a well-oiled machine and they scrap a lot of one goal victories, this team will be lucky to still be in the title race by December. Great potential in Can, Ibe (a personal favourite), Clyne and Sakho (to an extent) to couple the very good but inconsistent Sterling and Coutinho, but this lot have taken a step side ways in my opinion.

I think that will be our core expenditure, but either a) I think people on here have taken it too literally, figuring it to mean we will NEVER buy a player who's more, even if we got offered a chance to buy Bale back, and b) I think that it's foolish to categorise us into a price category that even Stoke are looking to break with Shaqiri.

Like it or not, but football is about spending power nowadays.  You can't underspend all your rivals in terms of transfers and wages on a consistent basis and hope for consistency in challenging for top 4.  You can do it for a stint, but eventually you fall away, like has happened to us in the last 2 seasons.  We're not underperforming any more, we're performing right on par with our fiscal status.

So to me the situation is this - either Levy stops talking top 4 as though failing to get it is an immediately sackable offence and settles for Europa year on year, or he puts his money where his mouth is and gambles on some high value acquisitions playing us into contention.  And yes, I see those two as mutually exclusive, because I honestly can't see how we can keep being the only EPL club to turn a tidy profit and yet still push for UCL.

Alderweireld, like Fazio, Dier, Wimmer and Trippier, is a solid enough defensive purchase.  But he's not the kind of player who will make the difference between getting into Champions League or not.  For that we need to be more ambitious, and spend big on key players in the exact areas we need them (for me, winger and CDM at the moment). When even Wenger has been forced to break the bank for players like Ozil and Sanchez just to retain their grip on top 4, then I don't see why we should be stuck in the 10-15m zone, perpetually crossing our fingers and hoping for the best.",null,0,null,1435881248,null,0,false,0,csqghzc,null,t3_3bus4o,null,t1_csqghzc,null,t1_csprirp,null,null,null,1437538328,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null
