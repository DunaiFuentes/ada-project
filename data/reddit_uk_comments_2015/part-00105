&gt;when Yaya isn't on the pitch the team doesnt do nearly as well.

This is true, but that isn't because of how good Yaya is, it's because we have only got 3 CM's, and 2 of them are defensive midfielders. 

Yaya's role in the team is to start the attacks from the back, and link Nasri and Silva when they are on different sides of the pitch. He gets the ball and passes it, thats the crucial part of his game which we don't have when he's playing.

There are many good players in European football who can do that, but he's the only one we have for some reason.

&gt; Yaya toure is like Pirlo

This is fair enough when you talk about free kicks and passing, but Pirlo doesn't have 1 player covering him like you are suggesting, he has 3. Not only does Vidal do all his defensive work, Pogba or Marchisio do most of his attacking running, and Juventus have 3 centrebacks, so when Pirlo makes defensive mistakes, theres an extra man covering. 

So you really can't compare Yaya and Pirlo in any real sense - the entire Juventus team is set up for Pirlo's benefit and still they are moving him towards the bench because they can't afford to carry him in big European games - he was dropped for Dortmund.

And if his defensive work rate was the only thing that had dropped I would agree with you - but he's reached a point where he just doesn't run *at all*. He's just as lazy in attack as in defence - and you can see that in the stats. 1 assist in 31 games! I think [this was the last time he actually ran](http://gfycat.com/AdeptOpulentAntbear) and he still had an awful game that day.

We can't afford to have a player who doesn't attack or defend. He just walks around receiving and passing the ball and not much else. His attitude is terrible and he constantly tries to flirt with other teams to get more money. His lazyness is awful for the team as well. Everyone knows that he will do no work and still get picked every week and I don't see how any manager could motivate a team to work hard when a star player gets a free pass.

Lastly there's the old ""leave them wanting more"" thing. We need to sell while he's still attractive to someone instead of waiting until he's declined so much we're paying a bench warmer £250k/week. Mancini seems to really want him, Inter seem to have the money. If they offered £10m+ I'd take it. 

£10m fee and his £12m wages being lifted off the books would be enough to pay for a £30m player signed on a long term deal and paid £150k/week.

We took the dog, the ~~empty tea bag box~~ pinhole projector, and camera and tripod, and had a wicked good stroll through the woods by the quarry marvelling at all the spring flowers on the way, and then toddled off up the hill where a couple of dozen other people were gathered.

It was mostly hazy sunshine up there but we were above most of the mist and I think we've probably had the best of it weather-wise. It certainly wasn't like Bodmin in '99 but it got very chilly and gloomy and I took some pictures and the projector worked and it was all rather jolly and bloody good to be alive in the early spring. The dog had a tennis ball with an unbelievably comic squeak and everybody was happy.

Then another stroll home and by 'eck I had an appetite, so I've just had bacon, fried salami, avocado, and about a pound of ground pepper on a baguette - abso-fucking-lutely glorious!

Rosaceans have changes to many aspects of their skin including the vascular network (blood vessels).

Some rosaceans do fine with topicals in the early days and others do best with at least a 'kick start' from a course of antibiotics (but think of them as being anti inflammatories for rosacea, lots of drugs have more than one action). Sometimes rosaceans need to try more than one oral or topical drug before finding the right one, other people get the right drug for them first time.

The doctor may keep you on antibiotics or they may switch your to a topical drug, both are fine depending how your skin is at the time. It is very positive you have been correctly diagnosed at an early stage, sounds like your doctor is aware of best practice.

It is great that you know your diet needs cleaning up: that is a positive step you can take to hep you feel in control of your own skin.

But of course the specifics aren't the real point, the real point is very clear;
  
&gt;I’ve been the recipient of this normal male anger many times. If I write or say something about electric cars, wind turbines, solar panels or the fact that’s it’s time we ditched the tired old internal combustion engine, I get abuse from this same, small minority.  
  
There is a machismo infused ideology floating around which Clarkson and his manchildren droogs typify, the absurd notion that loud noises and fast moving metal equates to manliness is absurd and dumb. It's Anti-intellectualism in it's most invidious form because it's self-supposed superiority acts as a filter poopooing anything 'hippy' or 'new age' while championing the most immoral, wasteful and absurd uses of the world resources simply because it's what they've decided, based on circular reasoning, is 'real mens fun' 
  
Robert Llewellyn, as you'll probably know, deeply enjoys a very similar form of mechanicalism and mechanical excess - actually most humans do, scrap heap challange was brilliant in this regard. The point he's making in his post is that this isn't 1950 anymore - cars aren't the future anymore... He isn't interested in being associated with the moribund world of machismo mechanic meatheads purposely wasting fuel just to prove their cubic capacity is far greater than their cranial capacity - the greats of motoring have all passed on long since and it's not drawing new, certainly not to combustion engines, because sharp minds race to the cutting edge- they don't obsess over antiquated and answered ideas. 

The clarkson supporters wing are as much as i can tell made of three groups of people; those in the main are losers that've invested so much effort in crafting what TV told them was a 'real man' image they'd lose face were they to switch now [Hammond], then there are the genuinely regressive minded old stick in the mud types [May] and of course a few rich brats scared a changing world might mean a change in their fortunes [Clarkson] -- back when cars were new these same people would be clinging to the machismo of horse riding and attacking any new thing or associated ideal...  
  
The point of topgear isn't to marvel at the shifting trends in transportation rather it's a rallying point for those resisting what they see as 'PC culture' but everyone else see's simply as the modern world. 

Top gear are not running studies on economical cars because they hope to discover more and to educate and inform, they're not spending their vast budget inspiring people to find out more and to take steps towards becoming a responsible member of the human species - they're looking for ways to attack, deride and dismiss anything and everything which doesn't conform to the weird 'more power' model of machismo they've devoted themselves to. 
  
Of course topgear has proven economical cars aren't as economical as we think, it's the exact same failed attempt at an argument as your 'who's the real racists?!' joke, find a tiny theoretical flaw or some way of looking at something which is negative then make that basically the only thing you talk about while trying to totally reframe things so you can switch around the places in the argument and when you zoom out a totally absurd conclusion seems to have been justified... 
  
I see it happen all the time among my friends, 'that one car in our likely suspect test did a little worse than an over exaggeration we found' becomes an argument which equates to 'economical cars aren't that economical' which equates to 'we shouldn't bother trying to shift towards a sustainable and ecologically positive mode of existence because it wouldn't work anyway...' to 'real men burn tires instead of josssticks'

It's not that we don't like the EU, it's that conversation focuses on retreating from it.  We don't want to get involved in Ukraine, we're recalled troops from the middle east and we have only very minimal involvement in stopping ISIS.  

Diplomatically, forget any involvement in a peace agreement between Palestine and Israel. We only ever made half-hearted attempts as managing/helping out in Libya and other countries in North Africa after revolutions there.  We didn't even seem to care about the pro-democracy revolutions in Hong Kong - a former Overseas Territory until less than 20 years ago.

With this mess in Ukraine, it turns out almost no one at the Foreign Office can speak Russian.  France and Germany go off to figure something out, but we don't want to get involved (neither the politicians, not the people).  

Beyond Europe there is only minimal foreign policy.  The political parties are quite silent on TTIP.  I think they both agree, but leaving it to the EU (probably because it's not terribly popular - again with the people of Europe looking in, and not out).  We like the US, but that's pretty much it I'm not aware on any other new initiatives on that front, except for letting them borrow our new aircraftless carrier.

Outside the western world altogether, there's a general idea that we should be exporting more to developing nations.  Joining the AIIB is an *interesting* idea, but our whole BRICS policy seems to be focused on brown-nosing China after hosting the Dalai Lama. 

The odd thing, is that it's not top down.  No one gives a shit.  No ordinary person seems to volunteer an opinion that we could have made a difference in a place like Libya (probably because nobody does, although we probably could - if not alone, with France and Italy).   The popular cry is to cut foreign aid budgets.  Not only do we not want any immigration - we don't seem to want to intervene to help dampen the problem.  It's the same across Europe with Italy, Greece and Spain bearing the brunt of it, but no one wanting to sort out the problems outside their own border, let alone a concerted effort to reduce it at source.

There a lot that we can contribute from a humanitarian perspective and a dodgy invasion of Iraq is no reason to retreat completely from the world stage.  I think today's world is more dangerous, at least in part because of we, and our allies have collectively retreated from it.

Secondly, It depends on overall study -  I resat my AS at A2 and got almost full marks on those exams as they were easier.

You had to be at at least county/ national level to achieve full marks on sport assessment which was part of the syllabus at the time in 2009.
 
It is not an easy A level. People seem to think its about playing sport. In actual fact many people find it difficult to achieve a decent grade as you may be good at sport but not pass Anatomy and Physiology (Not easy) and that would really take a bulk of the grading critera for the overall A level. 

The area's were surrounding the main disciplinaries in sport and exercise science: Biomechanics, Psychology/Skill acquisition, Anatomy and Physiology and Contemporary issues in Sport... then of course the sporting assessment - video or a presentation that would link these disciplinaries up (Sport Science).

That's the one young player that is ready. I don't think we should start youth players just because. Plus I like our loan program. It gives them plenty of time to shine. If they can't cut it at a loan team then they are not going to be good enough at Chelsea. Its really that simple. Finding a youth player that will turn out to be world class is not an easy thing. World class is what belongs on the pitch when we play. Our players that sit on the bench barely get time. They deserve playing time before youth players do. Youth players need to be playing every week.

What does this mean? If he wasn't at City he wouldn't be anywhere near Liverpool. Not on those wages. So what is the point? Yes, Gerrard could have got a massive wage increase at another club. Fact is he didn't. He stayed regardless of the cash being waved in his face by other clubs. 

The club can't afford to give the sort of cash that Hendo's agent wants for Hendo. It doesn't matter what other players at other clubs get. Give Hendo 120k+ or more and where does it stop? It sets a precedent. That is the top end of the wages scale for any player at Liverpool. The sort of cash that players who are proven season after season.

This is just a case of agents being greedy and it would be extremely dangerous for the club to give into those demands. It means any player joining who is better or current players who develop and perform well can reasonably demand 120k minimum. Where does that leave LFC on the wages front? Fucked.

Hendo has played well recently but in context he is nowhere near the likes of clubs legends like Stevie G. As I've said he needs to prove himself as a player and as a leader for a longer before demanding that sort of wage.",null,0,null,1426851765,null,0,1426852072,0,cpkw94u,null,t3_2zkhg6,null,t1_cpkw94u,null,t1_cpkvqhu,null,null,null,1427872376,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

We might not be able to hold back the tide, but that doesn't mean people won't gain a little comfort from the friendly offer of an umbrella. I mean, what's the point in feeding and warming yourself if not the recognition that, whatever the macroscopic direction of society, our microscopic individual lives can be better or worse than they are? I was raised in a cult and it's had an immeasurably destructive effect on me. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, and I certainly wouldn't enable it because the people saved will only eventually die anyway. The only response to nihilism that makes sense to me is that a life improved even in the smallest possible sense, whether it matters in the grand old scheme of things or not, is still a better life for the person living it, and I don't think it's ever fair to begrudge someone that. A tiny step up, or an avoided step down, can only be a good thing. I hasten to add that people have been calling the world a lost cause since the advent of language, but in many ways humanity has never had it so good. We wiped smallpox off the face of the earth. We invented ways of making food vastly safer. We can build incredible structures that keep us warm and safe, we can span the earth in hours and communicate across it in milliseconds.

The issue with one of your analogies is, I think:

* Driving over 70mph is (technically) illegal and you're not supposed to. Whether your car can do 75mph or 125mph, you're not using it within the law.

Cigarettes, on the other hand, are addictive, known to contain toxins in every single one, cause disease, health conditions and premature death. Smoking one is not illegal, but every single one is potentially dangerous. A car, used correctly, is not (ignoring that they are pretty dangerous and in 50 years time kids will look at us aghast when we tell them we used to let people drive their own cars).

However, your comment on foods &gt;2kcal is interesting as I can see parallels there. I suppose you would have to ask: is an individual likely to eat the entire product in one sitting. Is the individual likely to eat more than one a day or regularly? Can the manufacturer use alternative ingredients that would not produce such a high calorie level? etc. If yes, then I imagine there are regulations in place?

The only difference I see is that it is a comparison to a foodstuff and so the rules and regs would be different.

We have plenty of space for Drs, who are paid well and can afford higher rents that demand has brought.  Indeed we have space for everyone living here now, by simple fact that they (immigrants) are not on the streets.  Yes, of course housing is too high and needs addressing, and no, UKIP will not be addressing this issue (or Tories for that matter).

And it's an absurdly moronic to analogize a country as a business.  You also see people do it with budget and deficits and drives me crazy.  

Also, from my point of view it seems racist to be ok with free movement from only a few Commonwealth (Canada, NZ, Aust) countries... 

you also act like we don't allow skilled non-EU immigrants - and we allow in quite a few actually...

&gt; Non-EU labour immigration has also been the focus of considerable policy change since the coalition government came to power. Perhaps the most well-known new policy is the annual cap on skilled non-EU workers (Tiers 1 and 2 of the point-based system), which was initially set at 21,700 for the year April 2011-April 2012, and then frozen at that annual level until April 2014. The cap excludes intra-company transfers (ICTs) and migrants on very high salaries. As of April 2011, the government also raised the minimum earnings threshold for ICTs wishing to come to the UK to work for more than 12 months.

I don't think we should keep Howard after this season. The thing is I'm not sure if anyone will take him other than maybe some MLS team. Joel was really good during his run but I'm not entirely convinced that he is Premier League starter material.


RB:

Hibbo is done. But there isn't anyone pushing Coleman. Kenny is way too young to be introduced to the first team. Maybe we should start looking at maybe getting Browning more involved. Browning looked good in the preseason and he is at the age where if he can't make it, he needs to be moved on.


CB:

Stones and Jags are obviously the starters but we have no depth after them. Distin has another year after this on his contract and Alcaraz is out of contract in the summer (thank god!). This is the area I think we need to spend some money to get someone who is around 26 to provide cover for Jags who will need to be replaced in the near future. I think we have to look at an old school stopper type of CB to play with the ball playing Stones.


LB:

Arguably our strongest position. We definitely need to keep Garbutt. That leaves Oviedo, who is better running from deep than playing as a winger. I think Oviedo should be moved on, as much as I love him.


DM:

I think we are quite strong here as well with Gibbo, Besic, McCarthy and Barry. If someone wanna take Barry, sell him but I doubt any would. 


RM:

Mirallas is as good as gone. He's arrogant and selfish but I think we are a better team with him than without. However we might need to cash in on him and I would be a sad panda when he does move on. McGeady is a good rotation player but we need an upgrade. I think we should really make a play for Deulofeu again and try to get him on loan. 


LM:

We have played Pienaar, Osman, Oviedo, Barkley, Atsu, Kone and Naismith there. Obviously we need someone who is an out and out winger. Maybe we can look at players from teams that get relegated. I really like Adam Johnson but his legal trouble might deter us from getting him even though he looked really good playing with U16's. Well we might just see another revolving door sort of situation again if Martinez stays.


AM:

Barkley is good but inconsistent. Naisy does provide something different when played there. However I hope we get someone with experience to mentor Barkley a little bit and to provide cover as well. Actually I think we are fine with Ossie playing there. I don't think Green would ever make it to the first team. 


ST:

Rom is still going to be the main man but other than him, it's really troubling that our backup striker is Kone who only has 1 goal all season. Kone is also past 30 and hasn't shown consistency in getting on the scoresheet. We really need to sign another striker who can come in when Rom isn't going.



Conclusion:

Our squad is young and needs some leadership and experience as back up. We need to spend money but we probably don't have it. Probably looking at mid table finish next season.

Zouma is a central defender that had already made a name for himself in France and cost the club £12m, that's not a sign of giving a youth player a chance. 

&gt; If they can't cut it at a loan team then they are not going to be good enough at Chelsea

This right here is rubbish, there could be a multitude of reasons a loan signing doesn't work out. Hell, look at McEachran, his career has been ruined by loans. He certainly didn't look out of place under Ancelotti when he played for Chelsea, and had he continued to have a managers trust and be kept and played at Chelsea he might well still be with us, instead he had a succession of disappointing loans and will never reach the potential he once showed. One article about Loftus-Cheek compared Ross Barkley at Everton to how a Chelsea loanee is treated, Barkley was loaned out but didn't play well, but rather than abadoning him Everton still gave him chances and he's steadily progressing there. Compare that to Chalobah, Mourinho claimed he'd be with the first team this season, but instead he had a disappointing loan campaign last year after an extremely good one the year before and he looks to have been leap frogged and forgotten now by the next big thing Loftus-Cheek. Young players are going to have growing pains, to go back to a Man United example of Fletcher he was hated by Man United fans for a good while and seen as not good enough, but Ferguson persisted with him and now United fans talk about Fletcher being missing in the 2009 Champions League Final as the reason they lost. 


Chelsea do not need, and will never have, 25 world class players. No team does. What they can be doing though is supplementing the squad with the best players from the youth academy instead of what has happened in the past where shite like Benayoun have been given contracts to sit on their arse. Instead of playing Zouma out of position you could have had Chalobah filling in. I always think it's a bit rich calling him a Chelsea academy product, but even the Bertrand sale made no real sense, he could easily have played back up LB for Chelsea if he was ever given a proper chance. 


All the talent in the world is completely worthless unless the players are given the opportunity by the manager to showcase it and grow. The leap from U21 to Premier League football is huge, but Chelsea thus far have done very little to show they can help a player bridge that gap, and the next two years we're going to see if that has changed in my opinion. Personally at this point I feel like we could have an 18 year old Messi in our academy and we'd rather send him on loan to Vitesse than actually give him a chance in our often disappointing attacking midfield.

Social workers didn’t help Victoria Climbie, for instance, because they didn’t want to be seen as high-handedly intervening in an African family’s culture; the predominantly Asian gangs who groomed girls in Rotherham were allowed to do so for years because the police didn’t want to get involved with something so politically sensitive, and so on.'

null,false,foreign-scouser,null,null,null,"Fellaini could potentially provide lots of thread if he will be given the same kind of free-role he had against Spurs.
I agree with the MNF lads saying that the battle between Fellaini and Can will be interesting. Fellaini is really good at doing dirty work with elbows and bending the rules, it provides players like Rooney space upfront. We saw Rooney having a game of his life last Sunday and i believe he has Fellaini to thank for that (not mentioning how bad Tottenham were at picking Rooney up). If Can is at the top of his game he can deal with him, but he will need help from the midfielders. Could see us atleast changing to a diamond midfield if not starting it to help deal with Fellaini.

Personally i don't think that it will matter much if you lot start Di Maria or Mata. Moreno matches and betters the pace on Di Maria and Mata seems really unspectacular to me of late.

Uniteds attacking threat comes from the left side in Fellaini and Young, as they will be matching their stronger side with our weaker side in Can and potentially Markovic.

I think they have little chance breaking through on our left and their right where Sakho has been brilliant and Moreno has superb pace to recover and staggering work-rate.

Though the key-battle in this match will be Coutinho vs Carrick.
Carrick was superb last Sunday at closing that space between the midfield and defence, but i don't believe he will have an easier time come Sunday. Coutinho, as everyone knows, has top-class techinque, vision and shooting, but what he seems to be doing pretty much week-in/out is surprising his opponents with his work-ethic and strength. He really likes to press and that will be key come Sunday.
But if Carrick closes him down, then i think he will have a decisive factor in the game.

It's a 50/50 match, and i'm more excited than ever.

 [**Racism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;__Racism__ consists of both [prejudice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice) and [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination) based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples. It often takes the form of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems that consider different [races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_humans\)) to be ranked as inherently [superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism) or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities. It may also hold that members of different races should be treated differently.   

&gt;Among the questions about how to define racism are the question of whether to include forms of discrimination that are unintentional, such as making assumptions about preferences or abilities of others based on [racial stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_stereotype), whether to include [symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_racism) or [institutionalized forms of discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism) such as the circulation of [ethnic stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_stereotype) through the media, and whether to include the socio-political dynamics of [social stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification) that sometimes have a racial component.

&gt;In sociology and psychology, some definitions only include consciously malignant forms of discrimination.   Some definitions of racism also include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on cultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes.   One view holds that racism is best understood as 'prejudice plus power' because without the support of political or economic power, prejudice would not be able to manifest as a pervasive cultural, institutional or social phenomenon.   

&gt;While race and [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic) are considered to be separate phenomena in contemporary social science, the two terms have a long history of equivalence in popular usage and older social science literature. Racism and racial discrimination are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis, independent of whether these differences are described as racial. According to the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) [convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Racial_Discrimination), there is no distinction between the terms *racial discrimination* and *[ethnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group) discrimination,* and superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and that there is no justification for racial discrimination, in theory or in practice, anywhere. 

&gt;In history, racism was a driving force behind racial segregation such as in certain [U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) states in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa) under [apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_in_South_Africa).  Practices and ideologies of racism are universally condemned by the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) in the [Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights).  It has also been a major part of the political and ideological underpinning of genocides such as [The Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), but also in colonial contexts such as the [rubber booms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_boom) in South America and the Congo, and in the European [conquest of the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Americas) and colonization of [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonisation_of_Africa), Asia and Australia.

It's not just a simple case of figuring out how much the cost is then making sure the taxes match-- it's absolutely impossible to estimate the healthcare cost of smoking accurately, and even if it brings in more, there's a maximum number of nurses, hospital beds, doctors, treatment options etc. Regardless of the amount of money it brings in, smoking is strain on the NHS that it doesn't need. 

Prevention is always better than cure, there's a reason the NHS is currently blowing a significant chunk of it's budget to stop people smoking in the first place. Visit any clinic or hospital and they will be plastered to the brim with posters advising people on how to quit.

You can't just use a simple cost vs. benefit analysis when dealing with healthcare bills which run into tens of billions.

However,my main problem with the topic is I see the plain packaging as a very ineffective method. Customers know what they smoke, and will just ask the cashier or their brand. It only effects the shopkeeper, not the customer. Never have we had customers ask ""What looks nice?"" They all know what brand, size or ""taste"" (Smooth, menthol etc) they want and base any new choice over that.

If people were allowed one packet, they are more inclined to go to the stores, and also they could switch to vapours which both provide a less harmful product(Although not the best) and a greater profit margin, which cigarettes to do not offer. Not many switch without seeing the actual product by the tills funnily enough and giving it a go for the fruit flavours.

You'd be surprised how little money there is in selling cigarettes. They are stocked just like Newspapers, and only to increase foot traffic. It's not ONLY solely based on money, but a middle ground for now. 

My opinion is based around the roots, and to stop the youth from picking up the habit in the first place. The time and effort going into this packaging topic would be much better used to be more effective/blunt and ban it altogether but they won't.

In the post-war period until the 1970s, there was still a large attachment in the UK to the Commonwealth. However, this was a complex relationship. Many in the political sphere wanted to maintain links, like freedom of movement, with the Old Commonwealth countries, like Canada, Australia and other settler colonies, but not necessarily the New Commonwealth countries, like India and those in Africa. Much of this opposition, in the 1950s and 1960s, against New Commonwealth migration, was racialised. It based on the idea that those from the New Commonwealth weren't as 'British' as those from the Old Commonwealth. This meant that more principled members of the government, especially those from the colonial office, came into conflict with the idea of setting up links with only the Old Commonwealth countries. This impasse is what led to large amount of immigration from the Commonwealth during the 1950s, and is what led to such strict immigration legislation from the 1960s onwards. 

It wasn't simply a case of pro-European politicians needlessly calling pro-Commonwealth politicians racist. It was a case where many racist pro-Old-Commonwealth politicians created a conflict with the anti-racist politicians, therefore closing the door on any major Commonwealth links.

null,false,joepo32,null,null,null,"&gt;Alright fine, Mourinho might deem none of our players having the potential to be worth getting playtime, I'd find that odd though considering everyone else seems so high on some of them. Zouma is a central defender that had already made a name for himself in France and cost the club £12m, that's not a sign of giving a youth player a chance. 

Yes but he was only 19. Now 20. That's a youth player. 

&gt;This right here is rubbish, there could be a multitude of reasons a loan signing doesn't work out. Hell, look at McEachran, his career has been ruined by loans. He certainly didn't look out of place under Ancelotti when he played for Chelsea, and had he continued to have a managers trust and be kept and played at Chelsea he might well still be with us, instead he had a succession of disappointing loans and will never reach the potential he once showed. One article about Loftus-Cheek compared Ross Barkley at Everton to how a Chelsea loanee is treated, Barkley was loaned out but didn't play well, but rather than abadoning him Everton still gave him chances and he's steadily progressing there. Compare that to Chalobah, Mourinho claimed he'd be with the first team this season, but instead he had a disappointing loan campaign last year after an extremely good one the year before and he looks to have been leap frogged and forgotten now by the next big thing Loftus-Cheek. Young players are going to have growing pains, to go back to a Man United example of Fletcher he was hated by Man United fans for a good while and seen as not good enough, but Ferguson persisted with him and now United fans talk about Fletcher being missing in the 2009 Champions League Final as the reason they lost. 

Fletcher really isn't that good. It just an excuse they can come up of why they lost. Loaning players doesn't stunt their growth. That's rubbish. Yes some loan stints don't work out but you can still judge if it was because the player failed to improve or if the team they are loaned too fail to provide the help needed to improve. Some players just don't grow as well as everyone hopes. There are many reasons for this. But more playing time is not one of them. 


Chelsea do not need, and will never have, 25 world class players. No team does. What they can be doing though is supplementing the squad with the best players from the youth academy instead of what has happened in the past where shite like Benayoun have been given contracts to sit on their arse. Instead of playing Zouma out of position you could have had Chalobah filling in. I always think it's a bit rich calling him a Chelsea academy product, but even the Bertrand sale made no real sense, he could easily have played back up LB for Chelsea if he was ever given a proper chance. 

So you would rather have our youth players sitting on their arse? You can only offer so much playing to bench players. And I don't see any youth players making enough stride to break into the starting line up. And Bertrand didn't make it because he wasn't the best at his position here. He never was. He wanted to play more. And with the roster we had there was no chance of that. Some player might be good but they still are not good enough for what the manager wants. If Bertrand was here would he even have a chance at starting? No I don't think so. And why should be lower our quality so he has a chance?

All the talent in the world is completely worthless unless the players are given the opportunity by the manager to showcase it and grow. The leap from U21 to Premier League football is huge, but Chelsea thus far have done very little to show they can help a player bridge that gap, and the next two years we're going to see if that has changed in my opinion. Personally at this point I feel like we could have an 18 year old Messi in our academy and we'd rather send him on loan to Vitesse than actually give him a chance in our often disappointing attacking midfield. 

Often disappointing midfield? Are you fucking kidding me? We have one of the best midfields in the world. They have played outsanding this season. We are a top of the league for a reason. To think a youth player is going to improve our starting line up is naive and a joke. And we don't have an 18 year old messi in our academy. If we did he would be starting in our line up. The reason messi started that young was because his talent was undeniable. We dont have that. Honestly no team has that at the moment. He is a one of a kind. Rare.

I was also a fan of Ross when he played there for a game or two so I'd say we leave this. If we were going to replace Barry, Aberdeen have a player called Ryan Jack who would fit the bill and could get for possibly between 2-5 mill and he's outstanding for his age.RM: Mirallas is clearly leaving as you said, id say we'll get around 15m for him at best. Would like to see us get Lennon based on his performances so far. Also would like Zaha if he wasn't too pricey but as you said getting Gerry on loan would do the ticketLM: Celtic have a young player called James Forrest who I am a fan of. The sort of pacey winger that will take players on. If we could get him for about 5 mill I'd be pleased. Also, Ryan Gauld is a young winger for Sporting Lisbon who isn't getting the game time he deserves. He'd probably be between 5-10 but again id be excited to get him.AM: with Barkley, Osman and Naisy I'm happy to leave this position.

You're right, there are some issues that only affect men, but very few which affect all men, and none which give men a reason to unite against a common stifling of their identity as men.

National men day suggests a reason why men need to make the assertion that ""we are awesome as men, and shouldn't have to feel inferior to any other gender."" Father's rights is the only area you suggested that is close to this, but I would suggest that Father's Day would be a far more appropriate vehicle to address that issue.

The other areas are not exclusive to men, and so only addressing them on a Men's Day would be limiting focus. Why not just have Homelessness Day, or Suicide Awareness Day?

I guess that's the point. For the issues that affect men, you can refocus them all onto a demographic that is not exclusive to men. If you did the same for women's issues, or lgbt, you find that there'd still be that issue of identity and perceived inferiority that affects that group in particular, and that is ultimately the core of what those days are about, and why I think men don't need one.",null,0,null,1426861366,null,0,false,0,cpl04l4,null,t3_2zmlpq,null,t1_cpl04l4,null,t1_cpkylxm,null,null,null,1427874183,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Certainly, Netanyahu is making no friends right now, and he is raising questions about the special relationship between the US and Israel. The reality is though, it's completely ignorant of the situation and to no small degree arrogant to think that any Western country, save maybe the US, is going to make either side change their position on things.

Furthermore, the recognition of Palestine is fundamentally detrimental to the Palestinian cause. It is currently divided into two pseudo-states, one of which gets along relatively well with Israel while the other breeds its population to hate Israel and believe that only through armed struggle can Palestine ever be free and their rightful land be returned to them. Is this really the type of country we should be trying to cement in place? Also, recognizing Palestine in its current state removes legitimacy to land swap demands and right of return for its refugees. If we are saying that Palestine as it is right now is a state then we are providing leverage to the argument that no land swaps should occur as its borders will be defined as they are now.

**About you:** Combo dehydrated skin, prone to diet related break outs, sensitive to exfoliants.

**Your opinion:** Most people are pretty well informed about the effects of L-AA so I'll just talk about the other bits.

Firstly, I feel like taking a photo of the serum and laughing at everyone else's L-AA serums, mine's so ""fresh"" it's clear without a hint of yellow, there is some cloudiness which I suspect is the Ferulic Acid (my Dr DG Ferulic serum has the same cloudiness). The only indicator it's an L-AA serum is the acidic pH, it ended up semi-bleaching the strip I'd left out at the end of the day.

Texture-wise it's watery and stickier than the Celsignal but not absurdly so, haven't noticed any residue left over but the acidity does cause my moisturiser to slide off my face if I dot blobs of it on without spreading. It's not fragranced but does smell slightly metallic because of the Ferulic Acid.

Depending on how my skin handles the extra acid long term in my routine this could be a repurchase, unlike the Celsignal it doesn't incur any extra taxes so is around £5 cheaper.

If you do go for a Corsa, I'd recommend the 1.0-litre petrol engine because it's cheap to buy and run. The entry-level model will be fine but the Excite trim presents the best value.

The Fiesta, on the other hand, is a slightly dated model now. It's been produced in its current form for about seven years, so it's a little old-fashioned compared to its competitors. It's still arguably the best though, if you can overlook a five-speed gearbox (as opposed to a six-speed) and slightly behind-the-times interior gadgets. The Zetec Econetic is a good choice but the entry-level model is fine too, if you're OK without air conditioning. The Fiesta scored five stars in Euro NCAP testing and is probably the better car.

I really like the Corsa, but if you're looking at the middle of the range for either of these models then the Fiesta would probably win. They're both £139 a month, with a slightly bigger deposit on the Ford. Both are good, so don't let me put you off the Corsa if you want one!",null,0,null,1426862110,null,0,false,0,cpl0jck,null,t3_2zo8ka,null,t1_cpl0jck,null,t3_2zo8ka,null,null,null,1427874374,null,5,false,CarTalkUK,t5_2w2lq,5,null

null,false,brownbear1992,null,null,null,"The gantry was a good idea in one sense. It was great for consumers and allowed shops to highlight the Vapours which are cheaper and less harmful, but also helped stores to make up for lost revenue from customer buying other things along with their cigarettes rather than just going to asda for one big shop.(I.e Impulse buying would be gone).

The plain packaging is ineffective as a means to prevent smoking. Also if it's a person who does not often man the till, it's very easy to have mix ups and then have queues form. As silly as it sounds in the UK, not everyone likes to queue and people walk out or get pissy. Especially around the 6.30 am/evening times. Those customers will go elsewhere.

There will also be the introduction of more frequent dodgy brands. All in all, leading to bad reputations for small stores. It all builds up. 

I just think, if you're going to do something about, what's stopping them from focusing on the younger generations, or going to an alternate method which does not affect one side of the coin just for the sake of popularity.  

I believe that cutting down to one packet unless medically prescribed (Mental +health concerns) would allow foot traffic to remain, allow people to do their side shops, see the other alternatives in the store fronts and buy those to make up for any loss in cravings. Better for both than simple packaging concerns which do not affect anyone, considering you're not allowed to put up boards/adverts anymore.

I don't want to come off a a shopkeeper patriot, but after reading the comments , many had the idea it was a win win for all with no consequences.Even minor, lives can be affected.

&gt;So far, so successful – but perhaps not astonishing.  The remarkable thing is that during his time with Innogy, running a wind farm business, he became concerned and disillusioned to find that the business performed well below expectations, and started looking for the reasons.  He also started to look more closely at the whole theory of climate change, and became convinced that the IPCC position – that CO2 is the primary driver of climate – was simply mistaken.

&gt;His book assembles an overwhelming case that climate correlates rather poorly with atmospheric CO2, whereas it correlates extremely well with solar activity and astronomical cycles.  The IPCC quotes the fact that solar irradiance is fairly constant, and concludes that the sun therefore cannot be a major factor.  But it largely ignores the fact that the solar magnetic field varies significantly and cyclically, and it largely ignores the work of scientists like Svensmark, who have demonstrated the link between solar magnetism and terrestrial climate.

&gt;The solar magnetic field tends to shield the earth from the cosmic ray flux arriving from space.  A weaker magnetic field allows more cosmic rays to reach the earth, which leads to more cloud formation, higher albedo and therefore lower temperatures.  It is well established that the extreme cold periods of the little Ice Age, like to Maunder,  Dalton and Sporer minima, were associated with very low levels of sunspots and a low solar magnetic field.

&gt;There are also major variations in ocean current activity, notably the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which appear to be associated with solar cycles and with climate patterns.  This too is not fully recognised by the IPCC.

You need what's called a DRO, or Debt Relief Order. You'll have to prove hardship and an inability to restructure your finances to pay off the debt. Council tax arrears are not under a DRO, so that needs to be paid regardless. 

DO NOT go to Wonga. You're drastically better off even defaulting on Council tax and having to argue it in court than if you borrow £200 and end up owing five times that before you even start acquiring money.

I am not advice trained, so I'm not comfortable giving more than this. Go see your local CAB and ask for a standard Debt Pack, they can help you fill everything in and will assist with the DRO if they determine that's the right course of action.

Thus emerges the myth that these gangs got away with it because people were scared to investigate for fear of being labelled racist. If officers across the country were really in fear of this, the stop and search figures would be inverted, with black and Asian people less likely to be stopped than white people. Why would it possibly be that in every other aspect of the criminal justice system the evidence is that black and Asian people are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted and to receive a prison sentence than white people? Yet somehow, for these particularly grotesque crimes, Asians were given an easy ride. There’s been much conjecture on the possibility that “political correctness” prevented their crimes being detected, but absolutely no evidence.

null,false,killa22,null,null,null,"That's fantastic. But I don't see why one day, which was set up to focus on the marginalization of women and serve as a celebration of women generally, has to be mirrored precisely in order to justify the creation of a men's day. I also believe that celebrating men as equal partners in the human experience is a worthwhile venture. There are, after all, plenty of areas where men are marginalized, not historically, but right now, such as education, at every level. White working-class boys are the underclass in education, and these people are often the most derided. They have 'white privilege', 'male privilege', and all the rest of it, yet they are the least represented group at university, and along with Afro-Caribbean students, are the worst performing group in education. This distinction exists all the way through primary, secondary, and further education. Do you not think the failure of boys to match their female counterparts in education is an epidemic? We hear so much about women failing to take their place in STEM. What we hear less of is the fact that universities are 60% female, and rising. 70% of law graduates are women, 55% of social science graduates of women. These do not sound like traditional female areas either. Areas where you would once consider to be male-dominated, are not certainly not (e.g. women are a clear majority in medicine). 

Men are falling behind at an alarming rate, and this is just one area where men and boys are in need of help. Attitudes which are dismissive based upon the idea that these groups have never suffered social disadvantage, and hence they do not need to have their problems examined will only increase the education divide. In our knowledge economy, the lack of degree holding boys will disadvantage them massively in their pursuit of jobs, and wealth, and we are already seeing young university educated women out-earning men in their age bracket.


&gt;Father's rights is the only area you suggested that is close to this, but I would suggest that Father's Day would be a far more appropriate vehicle to address that issue.

I suppose fighting for equality under the law for men and their rights to see their children would be apt on this day. I don't see why a championing of men's contribution to raising children has to be limited to one day though. Father's rights is just one area where men are in need of help after all.

&gt;Why not just have Homelessness Day, or Suicide Awareness Day?

Because men are far more likely to be homeless or commit suicide. It is a gendered issue. Suicide rates among women in the UK are stagnating whereas male suicide rates are increasing, especially amongst young people. Suicide or homelessness is terrible regardless of the gender, but men are more likely to be a victim of these things. Furthermore, the motivation for suicide is different dependent on gender. For example, men are many times more likely to kill themselves after a divorce, or losing their jobs. If you had a blanket 'Suicide Awareness Day', the necessary focus on why men are killing themselves in such numbers would be unlikely to gain sufficient focus. I'm in favour of any directive which will curb the number of people themselves, and I think a suicide awareness day would be a good thing, but a focus on the reasons why different people are killing themselves would also be important.

&gt; you can refocus them all onto a demographic that is not exclusive to men

The reasons for male suicide cannot be refocussed in such a way, and to attempt to do so would not address the problem. It would serve as neglectfulness and the explosion in the male suicide rate in this country would likely continue. Neither can be said for health issues that singularly impact men, or father's rights/divorce laws etc. Furthermore, we have discrepancies in law where men are sentenced more harshly for the same crimes. These are areas which deserve focus, and International Men's Day can give it that focus. 

&gt;If you did the same for women's issues, or lgbt, you find that there'd still be that issue of identity and perceived inferiority that affects that group in particular, and that is ultimately the core of what those days are about, and why I think men don't need one.

Again, the reasons underlying the creation of the days which mark the marginalization and suffering of these groups do not have to be mirrored exactly within a men's equivalent. I see no reason why that would have to be the case. I also do not believe that a men's day devalues these days/movements in any way.",null,0,null,1426864013,null,0,false,0,cpl1me0,null,t3_2zmlpq,null,t1_cpl1me0,null,t1_cpl04l4,null,null,null,1427874881,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I'll post a couple of sources that show it was exactly to do with not wanting to be labelled racist:

&gt; The leaders and officers of Rotherham council were not banning binliners. Or removing Enid Blyton from their libraries. They were standing back and watching while children were raped, abducted, beaten and trafficked around the country as sex slaves. And they were standing back because the victims were white and the rapists were not.

&gt;Even now – despite everything we have seen and everything we have read and everything we have heard – there is an unwillingness to accept that fact.

&gt;Race, the central factor in everything that occurred in Rotherham, is still being brushed under the carpet. 

&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11392781/Rotherham-abuse-didnt-happen-because-of-political-correctness.-It-happened-because-of-racism.html


&gt;The inquiry team noted fears among council staff of being labelled ""racist"" if they focused on victims' descriptions of the majority of abusers as ""Asian"" men.

&gt;The report found: ""Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought as racist; **others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.""**

&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-28939089

&gt;For years these girls have been told they’re “white trash”, that they’re worth nothing, that their lives are dispensable - so they believe it.

&gt;And all because a bunch of cowardly cops and councillors didn’t want to be branded racists.

&gt;In their pea brains they were convinced that accusations of racism would damage community cohesion, not realising what really WILL damage 'community cohesion' is 1,400 emotionally damaged girls who will now believe all Asian men are evil.

&gt;Who will forever hate them and who will teach any children they bring up to hate them too.

&gt;That - and the hellish knowledge for these girls and their families that political correctness was put above their safety.

&gt;http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/rotherham-sex-abuse-how-can-4119359

&gt;The latest investigation, sanctioned by the government, has finally come out and said it: political correctness was at the heart of the appalling sex abuse scandal in Labour Rotherham where the cries of thousands of children, who were raped and sexually abused, were ignored because the perpetrators were mainly of Pakistani Muslim origin, and that just didn't fit the narrative.

&gt;Whose narrative? Let's be clear. Political correctness is quintessentially an ideology of the political Left. It has been pushed, mainly, by the Guardian newspaper, and then given a far wider audience through mainstream media, the BBC at the head of the field.

&gt;http://www.thecommentator.com/article/5589/instant_view_political_correctness_raped_rotherham_s_children

&gt;There was ""denial"" that such events could happen in Rotherham and issues of ethnicity were ""played down"" by senior managers.

&gt;""Almost all"" the abusers were described by victims as being of Pakistani origin, but authorities ""wanted to play down ethnic dimensions... for fear of being thought racist.""

null,false,Jadunka,null,null,null,"Hearing the current state of Parma F.C. makes me really sad. The first hugely professional football game I ever attended was Juventus vs. Parma in ~2003. I was like 9 years old and my family didn't speak a lick of Italian. We were visiting a friend and colleague of my dad's who lived in Parma, and my dad told him we were interested in watching some football. We were expecting to get hooked up with some tickets to a local match or something, and we went to meet my dad's friend somewhere (I don't remember where we were exactly). Much to our surprise, he hands us 4 tickets to Juventus vs. Parma and told us to get on a bus that would take us directly to and from the stadium. We hopped on the bus, expecting Pietro to follow us, but he just smiled and waved and went back to his car. 

It was a crazy ride to Juvetus' stadium. The Italian people were trying to talk to us, but since we spoke no Italian whatsoever it was pretty unsuccessful. They were all really friendly and kept passing my brother and I snacks. Two guys even gave us their scarves! My brother got a Parma F.C. scarf and I actually was given a scarf of the Brigate Gialloblu. We got to the stadium and were ushered into a caged in section of the stadium with the ultra Parma fans. I don't remember much of the game, but I do remember that the game turned out to be completely rigged. Parma was up 2-1 in the 90th minute, and the game entered stoppage time. 5 minutes passed, 10, 15...until around the 17th minute of stoppage time, a Juventus player basically punched the ball into the goal to tie up the game. The whistle blows and it ends as a draw. The Parma fans went absolutely nuts and started trying to destroy everything. It was insane. Being a 9 year old American kid that spoke no Italian at all surrounded by super pissed Parma fans was pretty intimidating. We were actually hustled onto the bus back to Parma by a bunch of riot gear decked police officers. I don't really remember much after that, but I always feel a bit connected to Parma since the fans were so friendly and inviting to my me and my family. Sucks to see them going in such a bad way now.

&gt; How many MEPs, councillors and MP's have to do things like this before you stop repeating this?

I honestly don't know. UKIP is bound to attract many idiots, especially since they are the furthest to the right party that has significant support. 


&gt; In your opinion how many is ""too many"". Would you continue to support UKIP even if it was proven over half of UKIPs elected representatives were racist and or thieves?


I don't have a number, since I personally vote for policies, not candidates standing to be a MP in my local area. I'd say if over half of the MEPs were proven to be commiting crimes, it would really discourage me from voting for them. The party really should have had a total review of every candidate and representative before the EU elections last year, and since they haven't done this it has caused them a constant problem. The party really needs a thorough review of every candidate and representative asap, aswell as a better method of vetting possible candidates/members/representatives.

There is a pretty damning account on page 10 (see for full conversation), which in summary went as follows:

SF:  you get support for it, that is well and good. My understanding was that Sinn Féin approached you about possibly signing up to the petition of concern to bring the Bill down.

GP: One thing that I have learned is, if I go into a meeting with Alex Maskey, to bring a tape recorder. The simple fact is that that is an inaccurate summary, and Mr Maskey gave it before.”



According to the document, the Green Party put forward amendments and the two big parties vetoed them all. The most shocking one I notice was #49 which I have pasted below. I would have assumed that all Acts would undergo a reviewing system; are we really going to be stuck with this decision?

Conclusion/tl;dr

The GP accuse SF of lying and playing face for the Southern elections next year. The document reads as though the GP were ignored as blamed of not acting, but for some reason I read it questions what SF were doing during this time, only to remember the talks around Xmas and realise that like every political party ever to exist, they were playing their own game.

That's my point.

&gt;  since I personally vote for policies

So you don't particularly care if a large portion of UKIP candidates/representatives are xenophobic and or racist as well as being thieves (including Nigel himself see his fisheries committee attendance for 2011 and 2012). You ""vote on policy"" instead?

So that basically means you will vote for UKIP no matter what they say or do. As long as their ""policy"" talks about leaving Europe?

&gt; The party really needs a thorough review of every candidate and representative asap, aswell as a better method of vetting possible candidates/members/representatives.

What makes you think that would have any impact? This same woman has already been pretty offensive to a Thai constituent. What did they do then? Not only did they completely ignore it, they actually prioritised and promoted her amongst voters so she would get a seat.

I am sorry /u/_Brutal_Jerk_Off_ we have had this discussion before, and i am sure we will have it again. But UKIP is absolutely disgusting to me, and i am utterly repulsed by it as a party, the ideology it espouses; and those of its members.

To be honest, I'm not fussed about the tuition fee rise.

I'd put the disparity in your statistics down to Thatcherism again. Older generations are generally richer than younger ones today - this generation is the first to grow up poorer than their parents. Young people typically don't own their homes while their parents do. Why would older generations impose themselves on younger ones when they have the capacity to support themselves?

As for RB we are in need of cover for Coleman a good signing would be Montoya from barca, however don't know if it's possible with their transfer ban

CB, alcaraz to leave especially after his shocker yesterday that leaves us with stones, jags, Distin. We need another back up but wouldn't waste too much on this formation

As for LB, I think we should keep baines and Oviedo or GARBUTT and shift the other one to LM or this is last resort but baines to defensive midfield?

Defensive midfield we have a range of good options we should try and keep all of these maybe offload barry if it's possible.

Moving forward to attacking midfield barkley osman Naismith we don't really need to strengthen

Wingers, I would love to see Lennon on a permanent maybe it would involve mirallas but I think we could get a good deal, I think move on of the left backs forward for LM and try and get Deloufeu back and again I don't know where barca can and can't deal in transfers.

For strikers we've got lukaku who we need to keep hold of he's a great young player hopefully see McAleny back for the squad next season and henen who can play on the wing as well, we also have naisy who can play as a striker. As for kone I've gave him time and still don't like him he doesn't work enough sometimes you see him jogging round and not getting involved.

There are lots of reasons she could have money in her account - including bank error, holding money for a friend, money from a will, money from work that's saved to pay tax bills, money from sale of possessions that's pending use to settle a debt, money from a life insurance policy that matured, a pension lump sum (maybe from her [late?] husband's pension), lottery win, ... and yes she may also have been lying to them and have another source of income.

You've committed a crime and provided material evidence. It could go sour IMO - theoretically you could do time - but unless the victim goes to the police then it will probably go away.

My take on the situation as described.

Anyway despite that the car itself cost me about 2200 for almost 2 years motoring (not including fuel and insurance)
After building up 2 years no claims I now drive a RenaultSport clio 182 with all the bells and whistles (recaros, speedline turini wheels you name it) and maybe more importantly it has 34k on the clock and this car cost me 5k all in. I'm 19 now.

I'm telling you all this because on actual cars and parts I have spent around 7k... you will be spending almost double that for a new corsa/fiesta! and trust me you will be bored of the corsa/fiesta after a year.

Please, find me a source where someone says 'The rapists did nothing wrong'. I have seen countless people suggest that the council, the social services and the police are *all* at fault, but that doesn't mean no-one's saying the criminals are at fault. That criminals are at fault is contained within the definition of 'criminal'. It literally goes without saying.

&gt;I see little condemnation of the rapists and the culture that allowed these people to flourish. 

I particularly enjoy the cognitive dissonance that allows you to say this then post a wall of quotations from multiple souces that consists almost entirely of 'condemnation of the rapists and the culture that allowed these people to flourish'.

They're not comparable. Yaya is a big man, and he relies an lot on his explosive athleticism, it's a big part of his game. This quality will rapidly recede in the immediate future, we've seen much less of it this year as it is.

Yaya has always been somewhat of a liability when we're out of possession. He doesn't cover enough ground, isn't defensively disciplined and is woeful at pressing the man in possession.

This is only going to get worse. And it won't be compensated by an explosive attacking threat.

Sure, Yaya will retain his passing range and shooting ability, but it simply won't be enough. This season has been a very poor one, all things considered. We need a rebuild.

We need to look to the future, relying on an old, very highly paid player, whose heart likely isn't in it, will not be a wise move next season.

The best thing for all parties would be a mutual thanks and a parting of ways in the summer.

A reasonable fee and move to Italy would be a great move for both parties. Yaya's declining athleticism wouldn't be so glaring in the much slower paced and tactically orientated Serie A, and he could be a success there. Apparently though, highlighting that Serie A isn't what it used to be and it isn't as strong a league as the other major European leagues is a controversial opinion, so I won't go there.

&gt; Interception warrants issued on serious crime grounds are valid for an initial period of three months. Interception warrants issued on national security/economic well-being of the UK grounds are valid for an initial period of six months. A warrant issued under the urgency procedure (on any grounds) is valid for five working days following the date of

&gt; Section 2(7) of RIPA defines a communication in the course of its transmission as including any time when the communication is being stored on the communication system in such a way as to enable the intended recipient to collect it or otherwise have access to it. Making the contents of a communication stored in this way available to a person other than the sender or intended recipient therefore constitutes interception. A communication remains in the course of its transmission regardless of whether the communication has previously been read, viewed or listened to. A communication stored in this way remains in the course of its transmission.

outside the British Islands. They include those which are both sent and received outside
the British Islands, whether or not they pass through the British Islands in the course of
their transmission. They do not include communications both sent and received in the
British Islands, even if they pass outside the British Islands en route. For example, an
email from a person in London to a person in Birmingham will be an internal, not external
communication for the purposes of section 20 of RIPA, whether or not it is routed via IP

null,false,Pieloi,eng-durham,Durham - Chestleestreet,null,"&gt;The big French influence in their genes seems to have come from a wave of French immigration prior to the arrival of the Romans, but there were insufficient historical explanations to account for this.

I believe a theory was put forward that continental celts were often pushed out of France and Swampgermany (in the case of the Belgae's) due to strife otherwise caused by warfare and this occurred right the way up until caesars invasion. And it's funny because they'd land in Britain amongst other celts/germans with the exact same problems.

1. Young players don't usually express themselves as well as they would like on the pitch. If by chance the player performs poorly, he will be doing so on a world stage. That can cripple a player's confidence and his career. Look at how negative media pressure affected Kakuta.

2. Possible injuries. Youth players aren't used to the compete level of the Champions League playing in the Reserve Team. They're usually slower and don't have the experience to properly time when to pull out of a tackle and when not to. This means there is a strong possibility of them getting caught in a late tackle. 

3. More game time isn't always what a young player needs. Look at Walcott. Prodigy at 17/18 and he is still struggling with injuries/expectations of being the player who was supposed to be a generational talent. Same with Oxlade-Chamberlain.

&gt;I think it's been hindered by austerity because our economy was showing improvement (growing GDP etc) then the 2011 budget hit, and instant stagnation.

No question, but austerity wasn't implemented to spur growth, it was implemented to balance the budget. As for stagnation? That’s southern Europe. The dip you refer to has consistently been revised upwards and was not as deep as first thought.


&gt;Comparison with other european countries is pretty irrelevant

Comparison is useful when dealing with countries that have similar levels of development, similar trading partners and economies? A good example of this is labor market policy, France's rules require businesses to practically adopt an employee which has clearly hindered their employment. The UK’s labor market is far more flexible and has helped support employment and keeps people working. Now I know the big bone of contention here is job quality and that is important too, but it is of less immediate concern than keeping people working. Long term unemployment is a big issue and often has far longer lasting consequences than the economic damage a recession causes, to quote Krugman “* long term unemployment is deeply demoralizing for workers everwhere*”.  

Krugman also states that youth unemployment is even more of a pressing issue, commenting on a previous study done into long term graduate prospects. The study tracked students who gradated in times of high unemployment and times of low unemployment. The study concluded that those who graduated in times of high unemployment suffered “*long term damage*” to their working lives. 
Youth unemployment in the UK is about 16%, the euro average about 23%, France 23%, Spain 54%, Italy 41%, only Germany 7.9% is the only major economy lower than us. 


&gt;All your comparisons to Labour are irrelevant

In the years leading up to the financial crisis, the UK economy had
GDP growth averaging almost 3 per cent a year, but despite this,
at the time of the March 2008 Budget, public sector net borrowing was £36.4 billion or 2.6% of national income and debt stood at just over 40% of GDP.    
“*To believe this was genuinely cautious fiscal management really
would require you to believe that boom and bust had been abolished – as Gordon Brown claimed on a number of occasions that it had been.*” IFS 2015    

There is no question here, Labour was careless with the economy and left the UK ill prepared for dealing with any future crisis, like the one just around the corner for them.    

&gt;I call out the massive increase in debt, because the tories keep banging on about how they're paying back our debts, when frankly they're not at all.

You do understand the difference between deficit and debt right? Deficit first then debt.

&gt;20% VAT for one is regressive

Curious point on that, the IFS actually argue VAT is more progressive than it appears. “*VAT looks regressive as a percentage of income: the lowest income decile in particular would lose 1.0% of its income from a VAT increase, compared with 0.6% for the population as a whole. This impression is misleading, however. It arises mainly because, at any given point in time, low-income households typically spend a lot (and therefore pay a lot of VAT) relative to their incomes. But households cannot spend more than their income indefinitely. Over a lifetime, income and expenditure must be equal*” [link]( http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/gb/gb2015/ch10_gb2015.pdf)
 


&gt;cutting benefits disproportionately affects the poorest. 

I have said this many times before, if the state is your only income and the state is broke your going to be in trouble. It’s not evil it’s obvious. 

&gt;So yes, the recovery is just for the rich.

Admittedly this is where my own knowledge runs dry, however I think you are presenting a very simplistic view of it. 


&gt;You can say that because of their welfare reforms that are leaving people literally starving to death

Welfare reforms that had to be made, the UK still has a better safety net than many countries we are just in unfortunate readjustment phase.   
“*In free societies, people will fall through the cracks--drink too much, eat too much, buy unaffordable homes, fail to make prudent provision for health care, and much else. But the price of being relieved of all those tiresome choices by a benign paternal government is far too high. Big Government is the small option: it's the guarantee of smaller freedom, smaller homes, smaller cars, smaller opportunities, smaller lives.*” 
(Steyn)

&gt;if we just got our large businesses to actually pay the taxes they owe we'd be in much better shape 

Except they know how to avoid doing just that and if we attempted to stop them they would just leave, it has to be a large global effort, which takes time. We are however heading in that direction with things like the google tax and other international agreements. Change is not instant. 



&gt;Fuck the tories, they're the worst of a fucking terrible bunch.

You have provided very little of tangible argument to support this statement I’m afraid.

Ancelotti would be a good appointment, we'd certainly improve in the Champions League, but his record in domestic leagues isn't great. He's the one I'd be most unsure of, and I'd probably put him down the pecking order in that list, in spite of his pedigree and experience.

It's an enormous culture clash.

The most staggering thing is that many of these very people think their support of City is entirely equivalent of someone who's only ever known City, and will only ever know City - whether we won the Champions League next season or went bankrupt and were relegated to the Championship.

This was your original point which I dispute, that a black family is going to be so different to the white family that one simply has to move out because of it.

I'll turn it on it's head and try to use an opposite example, so we can see it through the same lense. If a white family moved into a house in Tokyo, and Japanese neighbours moved out because they're white. Yes, that's racist. Perhaps racist isn't the right word, but xenophobic, certainly.

City and Chelsea can't afford him due to FFP.

Here's the link gents.

Here's some quotes from page 32-36:

&gt;“Rotherham isn’t a very PC place, I think
that is why the Council overcompensated
too much. It doesn’t want to be accused of being racist. It is known that this happens,
perpetrators have been known to say ‘I’ll use the race card.’”
A former officer 

&gt;“We weren’t allowed to hold forums near
pubs because it might upset the Muslim
people...Muslim colleagues thought this was silly...”
A former officer 

&gt;“They (the politicians) wanted to use any ot
her word than Asian males. They were
terrified of [the impact on] community cohesion.”
A current officer 

&gt;“[My] experience of council as
it was and is – **Asian men
very powerful, and the white
British are very mindful of ra
cism and frightened of racism
allegations so there is no
robust challenge.** They had massive influence
in the town. For example, I know all
the backgrounds to the Asian Councillors...
but don’t know anything about white
Members. Not about race only but the power
and influence – the family links in those
communities are still very strong.
Definitely an issue of race.”
A current officer 

&gt;“It’s difficult to ask questions
regarding Pakistani heritage.”
A current Councillor 

&gt;This predominant involvement of Pakistani
heritage men was certainly the view of all
those who Inspectors spoke to who had been
close to operational
work around street
grooming and CSE in Ro
therham in the previous 15 year
s. Victims shared this view.
Our review of case files and strategy
meetings held about perpetrators and victims
as well as other information we came
across, confirmed that perpetrators were
usually described as being Pakistani m
en. *This was a matter of fact.*

&gt;“Everyone here will say it’s not a race issue,
that white people abuse
too. That’s true,
but there is a race issue here.”
A social worker 

&gt;“I got my knuckles rapped by [manager] on t
hat occasion for mentioning Asian taxi
drivers... **she had been told [what I’d said
] was controversial and not to mention
ethnicity.”**
A youth worker 

&gt;“They were running scared of the race issu
e... There is no doubt that in Rotherham
this has been a problem with Pakistani
men for years and years... **People were
scared of being called racist.”**
A former police officer 

&gt;On the ground, individual profe
ssionals felt under pressure. “
We had specific
instances where taxis were involved [in C
SE]. We tried to follow it up with taxi
licensing, but I can’t remember how far
we got. **We were constantly being reminded
not to be racist**.”
A former social worker 

&gt;**“If we mentioned Asian taxi drivers we we
re told we were racist and the young
people were seen as prostitutes.”**
A former social worker 

&gt;**“...you couldn’t bring up race issues
in meetings... or y
ou would be branded a
racist**
.” A key partner 

&gt;“The number one priority was to preser
ve and enhance the [Pakistani heritage]
community – which wasn’t an unworthy goal
but it wasn’t right at the time. **It was
difficult to stand up in a meeting and say
that the perpetrators were from the
Pakistani Heritage community and were
using the taxi system - even though
everyone knew it.”**
A former key partner 

&gt;**“People were afraid that they’d get into
trouble if they said something that was
perceived as racist....that was probably wh
y the issue had been a
llowed to escalate
so far, and that if someone
had had the guts to stand up and say ‘I don’t care what
colour you are, that’s a child’, then
maybe they could have dealt with it.”**
A police
officer

Hell, lets take a look at some of the other horrible stuff in there:

P26/7:

&gt;Many of those raising the problem of CSE with the Council did not do so quietly.
There were reports to senior staff, to Members, to Scrutiny committees, to
Safeguarding Boards. There were externally commissioned reports about CSE that
were not acted upon. Anyone who wanted to know more only had to ask.

&gt;Yet when Professor Jay brought forward the undeniable and cohesive facts of CSE
in Rotherham, her report was met with denial and challenge. That children had been
exploited and abused, that perpetrators had not been brought to justice, that the
Council had not been able or willing to protect them was not, with some exceptions,
at the forefront of many people’s minds. 

&gt;RMBC had commissioned Professor Jay, provided her with the terms of reference
and indeed paid her to undertake her inquiry. But what we found was a case of
‘shooting the messenger.’ The attitude was ‘it’s not us at fault, it’s her report.’

&gt;As we highlight later in this report, RMBC’s Audit Committee risk register of
September 2014 cited Professor Jay’s report as the second highest risk facing the
council. **It is striking that the risk identified focusses not on the problem of CSE or its
victims, but on the potential for ‘major reputation damage and loss of confidence in
the borough’ and ‘potential impact on inward investment’.**

Or how about:

P55
&gt;A number of similar issues and themes emerged from the evidence in the files, which
point toward overall service failure: 

&gt;• There was either no understanding of the law or a failure to apply it to the
children being abused; 

&gt;• There was no recognition of what CSE was, and how and why they should
intervene;

&gt;• There was huge inertia in dealing with cases which were left to drift for too
long, allowing the problems to escalate. When services did intervene, it was
often too little too late;

&gt;• Social care thresholds were too high so that children were not getting help
when they needed it. As a result their vulnerability and increased risk was not
recognised;

&gt;• There was a normalisation of pregnancies, miscarriages and terminations in
children under 16;

&gt;• The victims were themselves criminalised. There was no understanding that
their difficult and challenging behaviour was a manifestation of the
exploitation;

&gt;• Perpetrators were not pursued. Often they were believed over victims and
their families;

&gt;• There was no understanding of the level of intimidation victims were
experiencing and neither was this accounted for by professionals;

&gt;• Overall, there was inadequate recording in case files with no chronologies and
no case summaries. 

P57

&gt;**A section 47 report (an investigation when a child is considered at risk of harm) was
written which put the responsibility for K’s behaviour fairly and squarely with her.
There was no reference to her age and or that the sexual abuse was unlawful let
alone any understanding of grooming or sexual exploitation.** It was clear that from
this victim’s care files that there were repeated attempts by the family to get protection and support for their daughter. **Yet the documentation shows that the
social worker assessed that there was no statutory role for social services.** Between
September 2003 and May 2004 the social worker made five home visits. No support
was offered. In the end her family ended up moving overseas to escape the
perpetrators. 

And many, many more.

&gt;It doesn't feel right that you dismiss everything I have said because you disagree with the racial element in your own damned personal views and yet it was TRUE.

I dismiss you here Joe because you do not read what I have written:

&gt;Complete and utter horseshit. Race did have a part to play, but it was incredibly small against the backdrop of massive incompetence on the parts of Rotherham council and the police.

And again, you focussed in on the five pages that covered the racial aspect to the exclusion of all else. In the two reports there is a mountain of evidence of institutionalised incompetence, corruption, fraud, links between the local police and the paedophile gangs themselves and more evidence of ostrich like behaviour of the council than you can shake a fucking stick at, but the ONLY thing I EVER see you post about is that the majority of people who did it were not white and never a single fucking thing about the incompetence of the people in charge to stop them.

 If you were to close your eyes, flick the pages and stab a finger in at random, youve got less than a 4% chance of hitting a page detailing people being afraid to bring things up because of race. It is *incredibly* curious that you never bring anything up from the other 96% of pages.

I was near-on excited when I found reddit, and specifically /r/mcfc years ago, since I think (though should probably say 'thought' now) the layout of a reddit forum is much better than a standard one like bluemoon's. I'd absolutely love to discuss interesting topics with a mulititude of like-minded blues on an upvote/downvote system, where pointless posts are banished to the bottom. That's why I was happy when i found reddit - as at the time I'd gotten sick of trying to do it on bluemoon. An obvious example is the thread on United over there - I'd love to be able to dissect where it's all going wrong for them with fellow fans etc. etc., yet instead 50% of posts on that thread seem to be people just shouting ""RED SCUM"" or ""RATS"", whereas the other half are blues accusing other blues as being secret united fans because they didn't use the word 'rags' when discussing them. Such a fucking joke.

And yet on here, instead of a great forum for blues to have decent discussions, we simply have a subreddit bloated full of meme's, and johnny-come-latelys who think the world is over because we lost to fucking burnley and barcelona within one week.

I'm gonna be honest, I don't mind the foreign fans. In fact, I think they're really good for the club, and are what we need to take it to the next step. If you support our club, if you watch the team, then fair enough. You don't even have to buy city shirts/city cards to get involved - simply increasing foreign support for city increases our sponsorship attractiveness, which as we all know from looking just over the city walls into Trafford is part and parcel of being a top-class football club nowadays (though I do put the limit at fucking 'official noodle partnerships' ;). 

However, what I do have an issue with is the attitude of some of these new fans. Like the lad below me. 

&gt;""I just don't get EXCITED like I normally do to watch City play, cause I'm like oh shit, what's going to happen today, oh we lost to Burnley...fucking great."" 

I find that attitude disgusting. It annoys me because there's absolutely no way he would have been a city fan in any other circumstance other than us being the best in England. If hitting a poor patch of form, and coming second in the premier league whilst getting knocked of Europe by the very best makes him not want to bother anymore, then don't bother to begin with. That's exactly the kind of flakey support I've laughed at United fans for having for years, and now the same thing is happening to us.

Torres:

1) Was sold to Chelsea for an incredible amount. The club knew he was past it. They were happy to sell him. Jamie Carragher fucking said so on MNF. 

Suarez

1) The Evra incident. We'll give him the benefit of the doubt on that one. But the way he handled it afterwards wasn't great. He admitted to saying ""negrito,"" which was stupid.

2) Biting Ivanovic and being banned for nine games.

3) After all the club did standing by him after Evra and Ivanovic (at the expense of the club's reputation) he tried to force his transfer to fucking *Arsenal* by any means. On the fucking cheap too after his agent shadily exposed his buy out clause. 

4) He sourced an interview with Marca as a way to manipulate the media in his favour. In that interview he accused Brendan Rodgers, our manager, of being a liar.

5) On the summer tour (which he tried to back out of but was *forced* to attend) he turned up and looked like he couldn't give a fuck. He was asked to train alone because he was becoming a distraction.

You've got your head firmly up your ass if you think Torres going to Chelsea was as bad as the shit Suarez did. Really.

Edit: This sub is hilarious. This shit people are prepared to ignore is astounding. I love both those players. All I care about is what they did on the pitch and the memories they gave me. Even Gerrard had his fucking dark moments. It doesn't matter. But I'd love to hear someone explain away all that Suarez shit, and justify why it's OK to despise Torres and *not* Suarez.

Total is £1181.39 outgoings

My total groceries spend is £6361.10 since Nov 2013 (I have a finance app to log every transaction) = £397.56 a month.  I'm aware that's high.  I go the gym 4x a week and cook ALOT of meat.  I am trying to reduce my spend by eating cheaper cuts of meat.

Petrol works out at £112 a month but since I had to spend £1000 on car repairs in Jan it seems to be using less fuel so perhaps that will come down.

The app says I've spent £3822.60 on ""Myself"" - broken down £1087.99 on eating out/takeaways.  £877.84 on nights out.  £648 on ""technology"" and £900 on clothing.  That's an average of £283 a month but I haven't bought any takeaways this year and eat out rarely

£2141 on ""transport"" that includes train tickets and car repairs.  I bought a 2002 mercedes c-coupe last year but it has ate a lot of money in repairs...hopefully it's all sorted now and it will only require servicing..

£823 on supplements for the gym, this includes protein powder and other various supplements.  But I've since reduced the number of supps I buy and only stick to the absolute essentials

£541 on ""home stuff""

£351 on ""grooming"" - this mostly getting my haircut once a month for £23.50

£55 on ""healthcare"" - dentist appointments 

£46.53 on parking meters

Bluemoon is a good forum, there's some really great discussion on there you just have to dig through a lot of crap to find it nowadays. Bluemoon's changed a lot post takeover as well though.

It used to be a much tighter knit forum, a smaller forum with a greater community feel. You grew familiar with posters and there was always a lot of good natured banter, you could always find some interesting debate and discussion there also.

It's grown so much now though, and the user base has changed a hell of a lot. There's a great deal of new fans and younger fans posting on there now, and the quality of the forum has suffered, in my opinion.

Years back if a thread had reached several pages long you knew there'd be some interesting debate or good natured humour in it. Now, every thread has several pages to it. You really have to dig through the threads to find some interesting debate.

The moderators are also much more stringent now as well. Deleting and removing threads. Specific match threads etc.

Still miles ahead of /r/mcfc as a place to discuss City though. Ultimately because the core culture of bluemoon remains, and it's a fairer representation of the City we all know - rather than swathes and swathes of new fair weather fans dictating what it means to be a City fan, and outright gloryhunters attaching themselves to the new in vogue football club.

I don't have a problem with foreign based fans simply by virtue of them being abroad either by the way, I'd just like to make that clear. I have a problem with those who have jumped aboard the City bandwagon for the wrong reasons, you could be from Bolton or Boston, it makes not a jot of difference. I take issue with those whose motives for supporting a club have always disgusted me. I grew up in Manchester in the 90s and that breeds particular contempt for gloryhunters.

It's why I so often lose my patience on here, a lot of people here know how I feel about particular new fans, and many take great offence to this and I take a great deal of flak as a result.

I really can't help it though, I'm not going to change the way I've always felt about people who attach themselves to successful clubs because now we're a successful club and those very people say they identify with me and we share a common purpose.

It's a mindfuck.

its not just you. Its something of a morbid running joke in cycling circles. 



Theres something called ""dashboard perspective"" its the idea that a jury can and do usually empathize with the motorist because they are all themselves motorists. They all no doubt have used a phone, they have all broken the speed limit, maybe jumped a few lights in their time too - and no doubt they have also seen their fare share of cyclists using the pavements or jumping lights... Confirmation bias kicks in - they look to defend the motorist, give them the benefit of the doubt. They tend not to do the same thing for cyclists.

And when the cyclist is dead, he cant defend himself, but the motorist can. In fact the motorist can pretty much say what they want when there's no witnesses.

I wonder though how any motorist (who was in court for killing a cyclist) would feel if they jury was made up of all cyclists. I suspect there would be a national outcry as to how its unfair and unjust. But the reality is that's what happens when a cyclist is killed by a motorist. The jury are always all motorists....

He is the prime candidate, but a long shot for this summer unfortunately.

The problem is, we can't afford to wait around for Guardiola and if we replace Pellegrini this summer I doubt Guardiola will ever manage us. Guardiola will likely see out his contract at Bayern and we'll have a new manager a year into the job then, it wouldn't be the right time.

Neither will I directly criticise you for the claim ""everyone is racist"" as that very wikipedia paragraph makes it clear everyone isn't racist.

However I hope you spent more time reading through the [source](http://www.cos.gatech.edu/facultyres/Diversity_Studies/Nosek_HarvestingImplicit.pdf) of this information than trying to find that paragraph in the first place. 

Now before I say anything else let me make it clear this is actually a very good paper, mostly because like any good paper, it's honest about the research it has conducted. So I won't spend any time copy and pasting the MANY issues STATED, that could corrupt these findings and ultimately lead to a TL:DR attitude, I'll just paste one.

&gt;Because participation at the IAT Website was open and uncontrolled, individual respondents could choose to participate as many times as they wished. Multiple data points from
single respondents obviously pose serious problems for data interpretation

Because if you didn't know, this was an anonymous internet survey started in 1998.

What I will spend some time copy and pasting though are some of the conclusions of this paper:

&gt;These effects are consistent with recent ﬁndings suggesting that personal standards and practicing nonprejudiced responses can inﬂuence the magnitude of implicit biases (Moskowitz, Gollwitzer,
Wasel, &amp; Schaal, 1999).

&gt;The meaning and consequences of this dissociation between the explicit–implicit nature of the attitude and social group (Black–White) will no doubt be a continuing focus in our research because of its potential to understand the deep reach of **culturally acquired attitudes** that are reﬂected in behavioral and brain activity (see Phelps et al., 2001).

&gt;Although the exact origins of all forms of attitude and beliefs are not known, **we regard implicit attitudes** to reveal the **deep inﬂuence of the immediate environment and the broader culture** on internalized preferences and beliefs.


This is a good paper, but as I suspected (with MANY psychological papers) it is widely open to interpretation and criticism. And above all, the paper is certainly a far cry away from an ""inherent"" or ""instinctive"" racism in ""everyone""....

I found on one of my older bikes that if the chain was way too slack, it caused a real delay when opening the throttle and would make the tyre prone to spinning a bit more. 

That was a dirtbike though. 

Main cause is likely to be tyre pressure, lack of tread or probably, cold tyres. 

Road temperature makes quote a large difference. My tyres don't even get up to temp on a 15 min ride to work, when it's cold outside. 

Roundabouts are awful this time of year though. Even then dry, it's usually rained recently, so all the oil, diesel and crud is on the surface.

null,false,theHM,null,null,null,"“BLATTER rival gets hefty backing for Fifa presidency,” ITV News reported last week, claiming that an obscure Jordanian prince had “statements of support from the King of Bahrain and Prince Sufri Bolkiah, a senior member of the Brunei royal family”.
High-level, perhaps, but unlikely to prevent the 79-year-old Sepp Blatter being re-elected for his fifth four-year term as the most powerful person in world football on 29 May – since, as the ITV report eventually admitted, “neither of the royals will have a vote at the election”.

There has been similar overexcited jabber about the candidacy of former Portuguese star Luis Figo; but the truth is that Blatter’s victory was secured long ago, with $1.7bn of unaudited development grants to his 209 national associations, plus all the World Cup tickets that will fit in the overhead locker. A more interesting question is who will succeed him after his final term – assuming that even he must retire one day. Despite all the talk of clean hands and new brooms, a new generation with some highly questionable connections seems to be quietly preparing to take over.

**Inherited presidency**

The first sign will be the arrival on Fifa’s executive committee this spring of Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad. The 51-year-old Kuwaiti royal, a former head of Opec, is already the single most powerful operator in world Olympic politics, controlling a $440m development fund. His father created the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) in 1981 and Sheikh Ahmad inherited its presidency and papa’s International Olympic Committee (IOC) seat in 1990.

He can be confident that Asian football will elect him next month as one of its three members of the Fifa committee, enabling him to attend the congress a month later and vote for Blatter. Around the world national Olympic committees and football associations are tightly linked, and his financial support for Olympic football means that the presidency of Fifa could be his for the taking in 2019.

**‘Racist attacks’**

Not surprisingly, he insists the 2022 World Cup must be and will be held in Doha. Last June, when the Sunday Times revealed massive bribery by Qatari official Mohamed Bin Hammam, Ahmad dismissed the reports as “racist attempts and attacks” and promised to “stand with Qatar”.

The sheikh is clearly loyal to his associates – none more so than Gafur Rakhimov from Uzbekistan, a leading official in international amateur boxing who has worked with Ahmad since becoming a vice-president of his Olympic Council of Asia in 1999. This was four years after the FBI had opened an organised crime file on Rakhimov, alleging that he associated with Russian mafia bosses, although it is not known if Ahmad knew that at the time.

**Eurasian crime syndicate**

Rakhimov was denied a visa for the Sydney Olympics in 2000 because of these alleged connections, but that didn’t appear to disturb OCA president Ahmad. Nor did the sheikh seem bothered when the US Treasury froze his vice-president’s bank accounts worldwide in 2012; or when it officially announced in 2013 that Rakhimov was “a key member” of the Brothers’ Circle, a Eurasian crime syndicate, and “one of the leaders of Uzbek organised crime”, specialising in the production and trafficking of heroin.

Rakhimov made more headlines in January last year on the eve of the Winter Olympics, when ABC News in New York alleged he had bribed IOC members with “bags of cash” to give the Sochi games to Russia. A Rakhimov aide confirmed that he helped Russia win votes through his IOC contacts – “He has great influence” – but denied that he had bribed them. Meanwhile the US Treasury repeated its drug-trafficking allegations in a further report last July. Yet none of this has affected Rakhimov’s position as a vice-president of Sheikh Ahmad’s OCA.

**Hefty kickbacks**

The sheikh’s long-serving OCA director general, Ahmad Muttaleb, was caught ripping off $62,400 in a scam on the gullible promoters of Salt Lake City’s bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics, but he too kept his job. Muttaleb was later revealed to have trousered hefty kickbacks from Fifa’s marketing company, ISL, but he was only eased out of the sheikh’s retinue after the BBC’s Panorama caught him, on camera, in the very act of selling IOC votes. With no hint of sarcasm, when Kuwait’s football association nominated Sheikh Ahmad to Fifa’s executive committee this year it praised his “commitment to promote equality and good governance”.

Having spent so long running the OCA the sheikh should feel at home in Fifa. As Blatter slithers towards his ninth decade – and a fifth term in office at the organisation – it must begin looking for an heir. It may just have found one.",null,0,null,1426890424,null,0,false,0,cplhgui,null,t3_2zqz1f,null,t1_cplhgui,null,t3_2zqz1f,null,null,null,1427882354,null,2,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,2,null

What will nationally be dampening the figures are the elderly and christian, what will be dampening the figures in London will probably be people from Africa, the Middle East, Russia, Eastern Europe or Asia who have no education on LGBT which add that extra 5% because of the high immigrant populace

I know people will be quick to blame this on Muslim Immigrants. But let's not forget that Chinese people, Korean people, Russian people, African people, Eastern Europe. All of these people ""import"" their homophobia with them as well. I have a friend who suffers terrible homophobia from his Chinese parents. But because everyone acts like the only immigrants who bring homophobia come from Pakistan, he is basically unacknowledged. 

I think If you insist that immigration brings homophobia and that's bad, that's fine.  But don't focus entirely on Muslims, because it equally applies to China, Korea, Russia, Eastern Europe, Africa and so on. If you want to stop Muslim Immigrants because of homophobia and this is your justification, you will have to extend it to the Chinese, African, Eastern European and so on in order to be consistent. Because they bring over just as much homophobia as Pakistan. 

And of course, it's not like American, Australian, German, French or other immigrants can never be homophobic as well just because they aren't from some poor country.

He was injured on his 4th season with us. For 3 seasons, he was an absolute monster and wrecked havoc in the heart of the oppositions midfield. What is even more shocking is that he played in numerous positions for us when other players were injured and still looked world class. You can argue 2006 and 2007, he was the best player on our team and without a shadow of doubt he was the best player in the world in his position. The Bison was a force, something even Yaya would have been envious of. Ballack best seasons was 2008/09 and that was mostly because of the absence of Essein. Michael Essien was one of the main reason why we won the League 05/06. He formed a great partnership with Makelele and Lamps.

Both options are money pits, and the only advantage is driving a car from new, you know it is reliable, but that is something that has no where near as much importance that it did say 20-30 years ago, when the day to day reliability of cheaper used cars wasnt sound. I've owned 4 cars in the 4 years I've been driving, one of which I took round Europe. All cost lest than £1000, and all have been, as much as you can ask for, reliable. If you are taking time to make a decision about what you drive, and really evaluate your options, then that's something to be proud of, but I would use that interest and common sense to realise that your better off buying a 5-10 even 15 year old equivalent of these cars. For £3-4000 you can pick up a 6-9 year old corsa in cracking condition, and reasonable mileage, which will feel like a new car as much as your instructors car will have. Think of the savings!

Presumably if you subscribe to the Spectator then you'll get more content and the article will turn out to be more than 336 words long. But this extract alone really isn't enough to draw a meaningful conclusion of any kind.

Any seemingly anomalous result here could be attributed to the fact that an unrepresentative sample was used (i.e. those answering a survey on attitudes to homosexuality are likely to have strong opinions on the matter).

( you can read it here https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/2zl6zk/z/cpku4hq?context=3&amp;sort=confidence)

 Now The  first problem with him accusing me of having a army of unionist alts is  this is I'm actually more nationalist leaning on the political spectrum why would I have an army of unionist alts?

The tone of his post was to spur a witch hunt against us it was totally and utterly inappropriate.

He accused other users also he seems to think because certain users like harry potter they must all be in some massive conspiracy. Which is ridiculous since as john locke pointed out harry potter is the 3rd most popular fantasy franchise on Wikipedia and has a massive fanbase. Also I don't really like harry potter that much.

He also decided because I posted on /r/marvelstudios I must be the alt of another guy because he posted there as well. Which makes no sense because I only discovered that subreddit in December. That and I have never seen  that dumbledore guy before on that subreddit until he brought it up  we browsed the same sub  he essentially tried to shit stir.

The only subreddit I knew me and the  dumbledore guy both subbed to was /r/christianity.

TL:DNR lit-up tried to connect dots that didn't exist and accused me and other users of being part of some conspiracy searched through   our posting histories then posted old comments we made and tried to draw dots were there were none tried to start a witch hunt. 

All I can say is I don't have any alts  nor am I part of some massive  conspiracy nor do I  know any of the people he claims I know and others know. Maybe one of the other guys he named is behind it but I know im not and it was completely messed up he searched through other users (including me) to try and spur up a witch hunt against us.

That and im not even a unionist which makes this even more silly.

Of course I would take a raise, but the company I work for had very little to do with my development, has very little invested in me currently, and will function identically should I leave, as is the case with most professionals. 

Similarly, if I leave to take a raise, that raise entails a drastic improvement in quality of living. £60,000 to £70,000 a year isn't even the same conversation as £100,000 to £150,000 a *week*. Also, a smaller proportion of the population supported me as I broke into my company's first team and continue to overlook my flaws in the name of youth and potential. 

It's absolutely bitter and selfish to want a player to struggle because of their behavior, but 'workers in an industry' is too empty a justification in this context.

&gt;Farage insisted that he had not ""pocketed"" the money but had used the ""very large sum of European taxpayers' money"" to help promote Ukip's message that the UK should get out of the EU.

We can't just give in to anyones demands.  In this market he probably deserves just a little north of 100k, but his agents know that he could get 150k if he went to another club.  The main issue is that if we pay him 150k now, what will he (and his people) ask in another year or two?  He is not wrong in asking for the big pay day, its the system that made him this way.  Now my main question is that is it cheaper to sign him to big contract (100-130k pw) or sell him and sign a replacement (Walcott, Depay, etc.) for their transfer fee and wages?  I think we will meet somewhere in the middle and I cannot imagine Sterling going to another club just yet.  By the time his next contract is up and if he continues to make progress, then I can see him leaving and earning himself that big payday.  For now, I think he realizes Liverpool is the best place to nurture his career, but he may as well get as much as he can in the meantime.
