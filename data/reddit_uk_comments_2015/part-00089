Why not just give the companions a better role, make them even more independent?

I don't think The Doctor could be played by a woman for the same reasons I don't think Batman could be played by a woman. Because  he just isn't a woman. Make the companions stronger characters, fine. If it's really just about strong female leads. But when casting for the Doctor, you're casting for a male character. 

That's not to say that Batwoman doesn't have her place in the comic books, but they didn't replace Batman. I'm not saying a woman couldn't do a very good job of playing some version of the Doctor, but it wouldn't be *the* Doctor. It would be Lady Doctor in the same way that we have Spider-Gwen, Super-Girl, Batwoman, etc. And yeah, I know they've recently substituted Thor for a mystery woman wielding his hammer... But they didn't outright give Thor a sex change.

Introduce a female timelord? sure. Make her equally as important to the show as The Doctor? go for it. Retire the male Doctor entirely and have the female timelord take on the mantle of The Doctor?

Right.  I live only a mile or two from Chat Moss (which Barton Moss is connected to) and pass through there regularly.  Last week I was out running across the Moss and you wouldn't believe the amount of fly-tipping dumped along the old tram lines - it's everywhere.  In fact, it's a fucking disgrace.  But it's been like that for at least ten years - there are sofas galore, industrial plastic containers with frightening looking labels on them, building materials - it all gets dumped down there.  The council clear it out now and again but there are so many ways onto the moss that there's little that can be done about it.

So basically, what I'm trying to say, is that in my opinion there's as much chance of these chemicals coming from the scumbags who drive over there at night and chuck their shit into the irrigation channels as there is it coming from the fracking test.  And people tend to forget that for almost 100 years Chat Moss and the surrounding area was used as one of the primary dumping grounds for Manchester's human poo, along with whatever was swept up from the streets.

null,false,marktbde,null,null,null,"Sorry for taking so long to reply dude - I was out on the ran-dan last night! I completely understand where you're coming from with the feelings-dump. It's incredibly cathartic to just write it all down and have it out there, the anonymity of the internet is a wonderful thing sometimes. I was in a similar situation before I left home (I lived with my mum in Scotland till I was 25 - please don't hold that against me! hah) I was stuck in a shitty town and I wasn't meeting any girls and all my previous girlfriends were starting to get engaged or were in long-term relationships and I felt so, SO low. I was stuck in a dead end job and I truly thought I'd NEVER find anyone. 

Then I decided to change it all; I quit my job and applied to a University down in the south of England (as far as I could possibly move away in the UK) as I had never went to University before. I got accepted, moved down to residences on campus and my entire life changed. 

Back home I saw myself as just ""some guy"", another down and out 20's something guy with nothing to offer. Now I see myself in a completely different light, I have so much to offer and my life is incomprehensibly better now that I am here. I have met loads of lovely people and girls who I could genuinely see futures with. I still have issues with some things but life is definitely better than it has ever been. 

What I'm getting at is that maybe you need a change? Now I was in a fortunate position financially in that I could get Government help to go to University here and I could rely on my family to offer support as well, I'm not sure your position, but if you CAN and if you actually want to, I would say go and change your life completely! It has worked out amazingly for me. 

On the other hand, if you have an amazing job/are at university or something already, please disregard what I'm saying :P Just saying what worked for me!

Your pension may be grown by contributions from your employer, but that's not the primary way that it grows - the money you put into the 'pot' is invested - in stocks/shares or bonds or funds or other investment products. 

So it doesn't *stay* as a pot of cash to earn interest on; the overall value will fluctuate year to year depending on how the market performs. But on the whole the market tends to go up in the long-term, which increases the size of your investment and provides for a larger payout at the end than the sum of what you (or your employer) put in.",null,0,null,1425838607,null,0,false,0,cp8b463,null,t3_2ych8s,null,t1_cp8b463,null,t3_2ych8s,null,null,null,1427646656,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

null,false,DukePPUk,null,null,null,"But it isn't that simple. The world isn't divided neatly between sociopathic rapists and normal people who would never commit a sexual offence. Consent can be a complicated subject (which is why there are all these court cases defining it in legal terms). The [report](http://www.pshe-association.org.uk/uploads/media/17/7910.pdf) that led to this change in policy noted:

&gt; A Sex Education Forum survey of young people in 2013 found
that the majority of young people knew basic legal facts about consent to sex but were much less sure about how to deal with the
complexity of real-life relationship situations and where and how to get help if they needed it.

They specifically stated that it wasn't enough to teach people how to say ""no"":

&gt; Pupils should be taught about all aspects of the law and sexual consent - notably that, in the law on sexual offences, the onus is on getting rather than giving consent. As a principle, SRE should promote equality in relationships and emphasise the importance of
seeking and gaining mutual consent through positive and active communication, and go beyond teaching how to say ‘no’.

&gt; Pupils should be taught how to identify behaviour in a relationship which is positive and supportive and that which is exploitative and controlling. Pupils should understand the impact of a pernicious culture that reinforces stereotyped and gendered expectations for both boys and girls, including blaming victims for the abuse they experience and other cultural norms and negative stereotypes that they experience and observe. Pupils should also develop the skills for negotiating consent and managing the feelings associated with their experiences, and how to seek help and support if they need it. Crucially, learning should open up discussion about real-life situations.

Legally consent involves having the freedom to consent, and being capable of consenting - there could be situations where ""yes"" doesn't mean yes, ""no"" doesn't mean no; and there can be questions of what silence means.

When presenting for inspection, you got a ""Doctor Who tattoo."" You let us decide if it's nifty, son. Of course *you* think it's nifty. You got it.

Now, for the inspection. Line-work is legit. Outlines are solid and consistent. Detail lines are straight. I'd like to see a little more saturation in bow-tie and upper part of the screwdriver, but at least it's consistent. Shading is rather well done, as well as reflective areas.

&gt;""You cannot let the people who want to break up our country into the government of our country."" In just a few words, David Cameron revealed everything you need to know about the Conservative party's attitude to the Scottish people.

He isn't referring to the Scottish **people**, he's referring to the SNP, which is by it's own admission aiming for a withdrawal from the United Kingdom. So David Cameron revealed everything you need to know about the Conservative party's attitude to the SNP. 

&gt;The meaning of his comments could not be clearer. We cannot let them into ""our"" government. We cannot let the Scottish people have any say in how the country is run.

What the fuck does this even mean? I'm quite sure David Cameron doesn't care about LibDem MP's from Scotland, or Labour MP's from Scotland. Conflating his comments about the Scottish Nationalist Party with the Scottish people is deliberately manipulative. They're not the same thing. 

&gt;But to rule out allowing Scottish MPs any voice in government, undermines any sense of belonging the Scottish people still have and puts at risk the very future of the union itself. 

No, it's to rule out SNP moving into a coalition with Labour so as to institute intentional chaos to play up their role as under Westminster's thumb at home, while fueling anti-Scottish sentiment from English voters to further antagonize Scots into voting SNP. 

It's very careful and elaborate, but it is undoubtedly the SNP that are the greatest threat to the *Union* not David Cameron. ",null,0,null,1425840421,null,0,false,0,cp8c2du,null,t3_2ycd76,null,t1_cp8c2du,null,t3_2ycd76,null,null,null,1427647170,null,31,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,31,null

null,false,toothl3ss,null,null,null,"I've been fortunate enough to have travelled all over GB and I've still not seen everything I'd like to see, despite having lived here for my whole life. There's a few places though which are really memorable for me, places that don't feel like anywhere else I've ever been. I'm leaving a huge amount of stuff out, and I'm more of an outdoorsy sort, so there'll be some bias. Also, I've only been to Northern Ireland once, so I can't really comment on there. I'll start in the south west and go northwards. 

Cornwall and The Isles of Scilly, especially Tresco, St Just &amp; the Crown mines at Botallack, St Ives &amp; Godrevy beach. It's the sunniest and warmest part of the country, and the abbey gardens on Tresco are famous for having plants that have no business growing at 49°N. The north west coast of Cornwall is beautifully rugged, there's a museum-mine just down the road from St Just, which is the birthplace of the Cornish pasty, and the crowns form one of the most dramatic landscapes in the country. St Ives is the epitome of the Cornish town, chock full of tourists in the summer, really cramped and really attractive, and Godrevy beach is huge and gold and blue and beautiful whatever time of year you go. 

Second is probably Bath, which I'd put alongside Edinburgh as our most beautiful cities. It has the ancient hot springs and so has a Roman temple right in the city centre. Down the road is the Clifton suspension bridge, one of the first in the world and cheddar gorge, the birthplace of our national cheese. On the road to London there's the famous Stonehenge, which is a very boring collection of big rocks from one viewpoint - though I felt a huge weight of time about it, which is definitely something I'll never forget. 

Then you have the capital, which has been done to death but it definitely worth a visit. When you are in the city I'm not sure if it's even possible to see countryside around, which is quite awe-inpiring. There's obviously all the famous landmarks and so forth. 

Leaving London, the remains at Sutton Hoo are absolutely extraordinary, the craftsmanship of the famous mask is unbelievable. I can't remember when I visited, it was some time ago, but I think there was a reconstruction of the way they lived, which was fascinating even to a kid in primary school. Further up the coast, Norfolk is great, has the biggest skies you can find anywhere in the country and Sheringham is a very atypical British seaside town, and has some of the best fish and chips you'll find.

In north east Leicestershire and neighbouring Rutland you'll find the countryside that you think of when you think of England. Little hamlets like Lowesby and the surrounding area echo with the old sleepiness of the imagination. You also have Melton Mowbray, famous for its pork pies and Rutland water, which is the biggest reservoir in England iirc. 

If you're looking for castles, there's nowhere better than the borderlands (either of them!) But you can also find some excellent specimens elsewhere, especially Warwick. Caernarfon and Beaumaris are fabulous examples, the one complete and vast, the other never completed but still amazing, especially with the awesome views over Snowdonia and the Menai bridge. 

Then there's the variety of Yorkshire, from the desolate moors in the north to the Dales in the west and the city itself, with the Viking settlement of Jorvik, which I loved as a child. 

In Scotland, you have Edinburgh, as I mentioned already, but the highlands and islands are the highlight for me. The western highlands and Skye make up without a doubt the most beautiful place I have ever seen, and there is nothing like them anywhere else, certainly in the UK, possibly in the world. The inner islands are magisterial, full of whisky, local music and stories, the outer,  more desolate, but just as beautiful. If you don't visit Stonehenge, visit Callanish. In my opinion they're more atmospheric, and there are fewer tourists. If you're looking for time though, give Orkney a visit. The village of Skara Brae is older than the pyramids and the weight of time at Stonehenge is as *nothing* compared to the sight of a house which is closer to the last ice age than it is to us. 

I've missed far too much, but I think that's what you need if you're trying to do a whole country in a few days then it's a necessity. ",null,0,null,1425840850,null,0,false,0,cp8cagx,null,t3_2ybp6s,null,t1_cp8cagx,null,t3_2ybp6s,null,null,null,1427647274,null,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4,null

North Wales is alright on a nice day, Anglesey specifically. 

Plenty of history, with more than enough [castles,](http://www.worldpropertyjournal.com/news-assets/Beaumaris-Castle.jpg) in the general north Wales region, the photo above is one of the finest examples of a concentric castle there is, despite never being finished - if that's your sort of thing.

Even got a few stranger bits of [history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryn_Celli_Ddu).

There are relics of past industry dotted all around the island, ranging from ancient mines to [obvious relics of the sea.](http://www.visitanglesey.co.uk/ImageGen.ashx?image=/media/72574/south-stack-1280-x-618.jpg&amp;width=1280&amp;height=618&amp;altimage=/assets/images/missing-image.jpg)

Decent [beaches](http://www.visitanglesey.co.uk/ImageGen.ashx?image=/media/72539/llanddwyn-1280-x-618.jpg&amp;width=1280&amp;height=618&amp;altimage=/assets/images/missing-things-to-do.jpg) (again, see note about nice days...) some of which are pretty empty even in the depths of the summer tourist seasons, despite being as good if not much better than the popular ones.
Obviously being an  [island you can't really](http://www.celticcruising.co.uk/Resources/Images/penmon%20point.jpg) get away from the sea.

[Plenty of big fancy homes,](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoNa7UlkQIw/maxresdefault.jpg) if that's your thing.

The island has some unique ecology - and it's not just sea birds, the island is one of the strongholds of the red squirrel for example.
The island is also notable for it's geology, it sounds like hyperbole but Anglesey is truly unique in some of it's geology - that's a bit more niche but if it's your thing then you won't be disappointed. 

Obviously Snowdonia is just over the [bridge,](http://www.photoforbeginners.com/users/2034/thm1024/1344329476_IMG_0160.JPG) where you've got views like [this!](http://i.imgur.com/ClpIPYU.jpg) (that photo is actually mine, not just shamelessly taken from the internet like the rest!)

Oh and if you're into aviation you are guaranteed to see some [Hawks knocking about](http://www.drivearchive.co.uk/xplanes/xtra/atah1.jpg) in summer, if not large or faster aircraft. 

Anglesey is a popular tourist destination, but there are so many places, things to do and things to see that are off the beaten path. Didn't appreciate it when I grew up there, but I'd recommend it to anyone on a sunny day (again, note: Sunny day. Don't bother during a winter storm, unless being blown over is your thing.)

Hazard is consistently the driving force behind Chelsea's attack. The amount of dribbles he makes into the final third, and the passes he opens up are second to none. I think everyone agrees that he should score more, but that is also a product of his attitude. He isn't a selfish player. His role is as a creator, not a finisher. That is what Costa is for. 

Hazard is among the 'game-changing' tier of players. He may not be god tier, but he is certainly the most influential attacking player in the premier league, and he is a driving force behind Chelsea's success this season. 

EDIT: Also consider that Arsenal, Dortmund, and Liverpool rely heavily on Sanchez, Reus, and Sturridge for goals. Chelsea finds goals from everywhere on the pitch, and we have one of the best strikers in the world to rely on for goals alone. We have essentially 6 players on the pitch who you can go into a game assuming they will have a hand in a goal: Fabregas, Hazard, Costa, Willian, Oscar, and (now) Ivanovic.

A woman entering the work-force as a single parent with a young child, for example, is not going to walk into an industry where she has to work long, unsociable hours, even if that industry is where she wants to be. A woman who is in a partnership may also feel the same way, if it's generally understood she's 'on call' for sickness, problems, etc, at school.


Conversely, a woman who might be approaching the peak of her career might not go for promotion, not because she can't do it and not because she wouldn't like to do it, but because she's solely responsible for the care of elderly relatives and needs to be able to strike a balance. While men might face similar choices, the stark numbers of men versus women who stay home and parent (and have a break in their career accordingly) and the statistics would indicate this is more of a 'woman problem'.

Far from being unable to make up her mind, that woman's mind might be made up for her by those external factors she has no control over. And I would argue that when factors back you into a corner until you cannot make the choice you would make otherwise, it ceases to be a choice, much the way one cannot 'choose' to give up work, unless there's money there to do it.

One argument I can't stand. I think by trying to revert to Classic Who lore, he is making a biiiiig mistake. The show was cancelled after 30 successful years, but for legitimate reasons: interest in sci-fi died down a little after all the business of space became old, and it simply outlived its time.

The show only succeeded in its reboot because of RTD adding in heavy drama elements to the writing, because that is what people like to watch now. Moffat is reverting that. Although he may write some great individual episodes (Blink, SitL, GitFP, etc) his drama element is just horrible, I don't know if that is ""intentional"" (he doesn't care) or he is just a bad drama writer. Nothing in series 5-8 was emotional or dramatic, the closest we got was one episode where Amy left, but nothing had a big feeling of loss like we got with Donna or Rose leaving.

Most of all, I think trying to bring the Time Lords back is a big mistake. That is the entire basis of the reboot, and that is the idea which saw it succeed. Bringing it back is reverting to a show which has already been cancelled, and for good reason.

TL;DR: Classic Who was great for its era, outlived itself, cancelled for good reason, and reverting to Classic Who will only end the show again.",null,0,null,1425843232,null,0,false,0,cp8dju5,null,t3_2yc516,null,t1_cp8dju5,null,t1_cp8aufm,null,null,null,1427647862,null,-5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-5,null

I also watched some stuff on hooliganism (firms) and its development over the years which was also interesting to watch. Still have to buy Bill Buford's Among the Thugs.

The fascist is a collectivist.  His glorification of tribe and state renders the individual expendable.  His relentless war-making generates ""National Security"" paranoia that he can then use to silence dissent and nullify individual rights: Why should the rights of one aberrant individual be allowed to stand in the way of the Almighty State.

❧

At the end of World War II, the victory over fascism seemed complete.  That was an illusion.  Let's start with the 1930s and look behind the mask.

&gt; ""The World is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes."" -- Benjamin Disraeli, English Statesman, 1844

From 1932 onwards, the Soviet ambassador Litvinov tried desperately to interest Britain, France and Poland in forming a collective security pact to contain Germain and avert war.  Britain mocked these efforts.  Neville Chamberlain, the head of the British Conservative Party, was more interested in ""Appeasement"" -- giving Germany whatever it needed to attack the Soviet Union.  Hitler, the founder of the [Anti-Comintern Pact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Comintern_Pact), was vehemently anti-communist.  Everyone expected Hitler to attack to the east.  At Munich in 1938, Chamberlain put the gun in Hitler's hand, then proclaimed ""peace in out time"".

Britain maintained a maintained a [naval treaty with Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-German_Naval_Agreement) right up till 1939.  The treaty was dissolved by Germany, not by Britain.

Charles Higham, in the book *Trading With the Enemy*, reveals that major respectable blue-chip banks and corporations based in the U.S., Britain and Scandinavia were trading with Hitler and providing Hitler with war materiel.  The trade continued throughout the war.

We're led to believe that the U.S. ""Saved The World from Hitler"".  But Hitler was already beaten by the time D-Day was launched.  The German war machine was first stopped at Moscow, then broken at Stalingrad -- 23 Aug 1942 to 2 Feb 1943. The Battle of Kursk Bulge -- ending 23 Aug 1943 -- sealed Germany's fate.  D-Day , 06 Jun 1944, was billed as the decisive battle against the Nazis, but the real aim of the Normandy Invasion, most likely, was to prevent the U.S.S.R. from liberating all of Europe.

❧

In the fall of 1945, we saw [""Operation Paperclip""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip) -- thousands of Nazis were brought to the U.S., given refuge and employment in anti-Soviet intelligence.  The whitewashed wikipedia article on ""Operation Paperclip"" suggests that these Nazis were all innocuous apolitical scientists, but that is not the case.  Take [""Klaus Barbie""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Barbie), for example, 

&gt; was known as the ""Butcher of Lyon"" for having personally tortured French prisoners of the Gestapo while stationed in Lyon, France. After the war, United States intelligence services employed him for their anti-Marxist efforts and also helped him escape to South America.

Also in the fall of 1945, we saw JIC-329, a plan drawn up by the Joint Intelligence Chiefs that called for dropping atomic bombs on 20 Soviet cities.  

&gt; &gt; JIC-329 envisioned the use of 20 to 30 atomic bombs to obliterate 20 Soviet cities: Moscow, Gorki, Kuibyshev, Sverdlovsk, Novosibirsk , Omsk, Saratov, Kazan, Leningrad , Baku, Tashkent, Chelyabinsk, Nizhni Tagil, Magnitogorsk, Molotov, Tbilisi, Stalinsk, Grozny, Irkutsk, and Jaroslavl.  The U.S. has developed nukes small enough to fit in a backpack, and has tried to blur the line between nuclear and conventional weapons.

On 05 Mar 1946, Churchill gave the speech at Fulton, Missouri, in which he used the term ""Iron Curtain"" -- the same term used by Goebbels on 25 Feb 1945 (""Das Jahr 2000"", *Das Reich*).  Churchill and Goebbels, it seems, were talking the same language.  

Implementation of this new ""iron curtain"" began in 1949, with the formation of NATO.  The Warsaw Treaty Organization (aka ""Warsaw Pact"") was not formed till 1955 -- six years later.  As I recall, it was after a Soviet request to join NATO was rejected.  The Soviet Union did not want such a curtain.  The Soviet vision was a neutral Europe -- the model used in Austria.

❧

Because the Third Reich is cast as ""Absolute Evil"", the Anglosphere is seen as ""Absolute Good"" -- the ""Savior of the World""!  But we see now that the ruling elite in this ""Savior"" were actually collaborating with the German fascists, appeasing them, trading with them, urging them on, then coming to their rescue at the end of the war and adopting their methods.  From 1948 onwards, the U.S. has been colluding with Israeli terrorists.  In the 1980s, we saw the U.S. collaborating with Mujahedin terrorists in Afghanistan, contra terrorists in Nicaragua, RENAMO terrorists in Mozambique and UNITA terrorists in Angola.  In 1999, NATO made war in behalf of the KLA narco-terrorists of Kosovo.  In 2011, NATO made war again, this time in behalf of Islamist terrorists in Libya.  Many of those terrorists have now been sent to Syria to cause devastation there.  Now, in 2014, we see the U.S. collaborating with neo-Nazis in Ukraine.  This is the ""Savior of the World""?!

&gt; We destroyed the village in order to save it.

-- U.S. colonel in Vietnam, as he looked out over the ruins of Ben Suc.

The clowns who wear Nazi regalia are not the Nazis we have to worry about.  The dangerous Nazis are the ones we do not see.  They are deeply entrenched in the highest circles of power, and they use their influence to steer us into war.  They are loyal to an ideology, not to any one country.  Global domination was their aim in Hitler's time, and it is still their aim today: a ""Unipolar World"", a Global Plantation, ruled by the ""Chosen Ones"" of the ""Master Race"", with the rest of us serving as their disposable slaves.",null,0,null,1425844112,null,0,false,0,cp8e05t,null,t3_2xwwd0,null,t1_cp8e05t,null,t3_2xwwd0,null,null,null,1427648074,null,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0,null

My current foundation is Sleek's bare skin foundation in Shell- looks *very* dark in the bottle, but sheers out to a perfect match for warm-toned pale. Not great coverage, but it goes really well with my concealer (Collection's Lasting Perfection in Fair, cheap and very good!).

I've dragged out the rest of my foundations to see what I've got:

L'oreal Infallible in porcelain- high coverage, lasts through whatever you throw at it (did a 12 hour night shift and it looked fine at the end!), is a tad pink for me but if you're more cool toned it might be a good match? I used Infallible almost solidly for 2 years, so it used to be my HG.

Revlon Colourstay dry/normal in Ivory- high coverage, lasts well, and they do one for oily skin (can't vouch for whether it's exactly the same, as I've never used it). Again, it's not a perfect match for my skin tone, but I do use it occasionally when I need more coverage.

Rimmel Match Perfection in Light Porcelain- coverage is pretty good, but not great on spots. Very light (cool toned, so again too pink on me), and feels nice and natural on the skin. I'm not a huge fan as it doesn't cope well with long shifts- gets a bit patchy on my dry areas, but maybe works a bit better on oily skin?

Makeup Revolution's The One in shade 2- very light, cool toned, and very poor coverage. Comes out of the bottle like water, and I've tried to build the coverage before but it's not that good on me. In fairness, it's very cheap! I also have shade 1 (white) which I sometimes use to lighten other foundations, but it makes them very prone to going patchy so I can't really recommend it.


As for concealer, as I said above I use Collection's Lasting Perfection in Fair- definitely the best I've ever found, light and neutral with amazing coverage and lasting power. I buy a tube of it maybe every 6 months, and I use it almost daily! Only £4 and definitely the best you will get for that price.

Primers- I don't usually go for primers, but I like the Revlon Photoready and the MUA Matte one. I use a pore reducing moisturiser (Nivea Q10 Pore Refining day cream), which does the trick for me- can't say I've noticed a huge difference in the size of my horrendous nose pores, but it makes makeup go on lovely and smooth.

Powders- I use Beauty UK's Face Powder Compact in No. 1. Nice and light (I find the Collection loose/translucent powders make me too pink), and does the job.  
I've heard good things about Gosh's Prime 'n' Set HD powder- supposed to be a good translucent powder, or you can use it beneath foundation as a primer. Tried it at Superdrug and liked the texture and effect, but was skint so didn't buy (£10 for a powder seems expensive to me!).

null,false,neenoonee,null,null,null,"1) Strict full suit-and-tie dress code
My uniform was black trousers, school logo polo shirt, and a blue jumper. The blue jumper changed to purple when you got into your final year at aged 15/16. Black shoes.

2) Students separated into ""houses"", and you take all your classes with your house.
No, we were put into ""forms"" and I was in form B. That letter would follow you all throughout your school career, so in Year 7 you were in form 7B. As you got into your final two years and were allowed to chose your own subjects then you very rarely took classes in those forms anymore - you were mixed in with people from other forms who were taking the same subjects as you.

3) There is a common room (for non-day students) for each house.
My school wasn't a boarding school. Schools are really either boarding or day attendance, there isn't a mash up of both. We did have a common room for final years to use when they wanted to hang out between classes and lunch.

4) There is a captain/prefect for each house
We didn't have this for each form - in the final year the teaching staff chose a prefect from each form and a Headboy/Headgirl and School Orator.

5) Each house has a captain for a respective sport (like football, rugby, etc.)
Nope.

6) There are many inter-house competitions.
When we had Sports Day it was easy to say ""All forms against each other"" but not throughout the year. Once a year.

7) There is one head boy and head girl for the whole school
Yep

8) ""Double"" classes sometimes, taken with other houses (e.g. ""Double Latin with the Waynfletes"")
All my classes were 1 hour long. No more, no less. And as I said above, by the time we were in our third/fourth year at High School we were allowed to pick our own subjects so we were all mixed in anyway.

9) Rigorous study of the Classics, as well as ancient Greek and Latin
In my school you did Latin if you were good at other languages. You didn't really study ""Classics"" till you were aged 16+ in college.

10) Deep, sometimes centuries-old traditions, customs, rituals, school songs, etc.
We went to church on ""Founders Day"" which was the day the school was founded but otherwise, no.

11) Teachers are on a last name basis with their pupils (as in, ""Mr. So and So, what mistake did Louis XII make in 1500 that damaged his alliances with Italian powers and led to France being expelled from Italy by the Swiss in 1511?"")
Only if you were in trouble, otherwise it was your first name.

12) In-depth study of European and British history from the Byzantine Empire up to about 1945 or so
I stopped taking history when I was 14 but from what I can remember, we covered 1066, Tudors, Stuarts, First and Second World War, Slave Trade.",null,0,null,1425845422,null,0,false,0,cp8eohm,null,t3_2yamr1,null,t1_cp8eohm,null,t3_2yamr1,null,null,null,1427648456,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Please bear in mind that this is just my opinion! I find NI weddings to be very samey - there's unspoken rules that people tend to follow.

It sounds like you're still in the early stages of looking for a mortgage, so you might find [this page from the Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/choosing-a-mortgage-shop-around-or-get-advice) useful. You might also want to consider speaking to an independent mortgage broker (you can find one [here](https://www.unbiased.co.uk/)). 

The majority of First Time Buyer mortgages these days are arranged through brokers, and if you find a good broker they will walk you through the process and handle a lot of the administrative side for you. Brokers do usually get paid by the mortgage lender, but that doesn't mean that they won't find the best deal for you. 

Whether you choose to go with a broker or to go direct to a lender, there are some very low rates available at the moment. However, make sure you don't just compare the rates, the 'total cost' of the mortgage also depends on the associated fees. A lot of people don't take this into account and end up paying more than they should - in fact, even some of the price comparison websites will just rank the various lenders based on rates, rather than the total cost.

It's difficult to give you any specific advice without knowing more about your individual circumstances, but in general be prepared for the whole process, from application to completing on the house, to take a few months (depending on your circumstances) - I'm yet to meet anyone who completed on a house purchase earlier than they expected to.

It NEEDED to be a soap opera because that's what people wanted to watch. That's just the age of television we are now in. The classic series existed in a totally different era where people enjoyed watching a different style of show.

People who say that RTD's Doctor Who was too much about the characters and their lives have no idea what they're talking about. RTD knew exactly what the show needed to be and it wouldn't be the multi-million pound brand that it is today without him. Frankly, I believe Moffat has undone a huge amount of work that RTD put into Doctor Who and I actually wonder if RTD can sit back today and say he made the right choice with Moffat. I think RTD refuses to take part with the show now because he knows it's no longer the show he created. Moffat has sculpted it into his own show, under his own rules and desires. Having one head writer is too much of a dictatorship and actually quite unusual for such an enormous show. I've said this a million times over and I'll never stop believing it - Doctor Who needs a team of writers. Only then will it be consistently strong.

I'm sorry but Moffat HAS to go. He's long out-stayed his welcome. Time to move on. The show has better places to be.

No offense, but nothing you say in this paragraph has anything to do with reality. These legitimate reasons, as you say, was in the BBC's attitude towards science fiction, in general, and Doctor Who, in particular.

As for the ""30 successful years,"" not all of the 26 years were quite as successful as you say. The series nearly ended after ""The War Games"" and if it wasn't for the Letts/Dicks years, we wouldn't be talking about this.

And again, they *are* in prison for rape. At least, according to this data. As I understand it there are at least two ways this can happen.

Firstly, whether someone is a woman doesn't depend on whether or not they have a penis (as far as the law is concerned). It depends on what their most recently-issued birth certificate says. I suspect that at least one of these women was an individual who was legally a man when he committed rape, but is now legally a woman (there was a case involving those circumstances, but I don't know if she is still in prison). Similarly, someone could legally be a woman and have a penis, and so commit rape.

The second, and probably more common, way (although I don't know of any specific cases under the new law - just the old law) is if the penis is attached to someone else but the woman is sufficiently involved. In those circumstances the woman can be convicted of rape.

Yes, these are very rare circumstances, which means it will be rare for them to be convicted of rape, but it is possible.

null,false,ctesibius,UnionFlag,Various Triumphs,null,"It's ok to do it for a couple of gears, but not the whole range. The reason is that even if you are intending to come to a complete stop, there may be a reason why you need to suddenly switch from ""slow"" to ""go"". The commonest example would be that you see a traffic light turn to green, but you might also need to get out of the way of another vehicle which is about to hit you.

If you to have to suddenly drop the clutch to do this, your engine revs need to roughly match road speed otherwise the rear wheel will skid. If you are only changing a couple of gears, this is unlikely. If you have shifted four or five gears, unless you are remarkably in tune with your bike, you will not have the right revs. Hence I'd advise that you don't shift through the whole gearbox without releasing the clutch.

One source you might find useful to read is *Roadcraft*, the police rider's manual. It costs about £14 and is easy to find. They acknowledge both sequential and block changing, but say of block changing:

* ""*During the later stages of braking*, hold in the clutch lever and change down the gears..."" [my emphasis]
* ""If too low a gear is selected there is a risk of locking the rear wheel and causing a skid.""

For sequential changing:

* ""The appropriate gear for the speed is engaged throughout, and because the drive is engaged except during changes, the bike remains stable. The rider also has teh option of immediate power if needed"".

Comparing them:

* ""Riders should be able to use both techniques but whichever you use, it must be properly incorporated into your planning.""

One final note, which is from me rather than *Roadcraft* - don't keep the clutch in while cornering as this will reduce your stability.",null,0,null,1425850370,null,0,false,0,cp8hby8,null,t3_2yd0j3,null,t1_cp8hby8,null,t3_2yd0j3,null,null,null,1427649693,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

As I understand it this was quite controversial when the law was passed; it needed to be gender neutral, with the focus on the action and actor, not the victim. It was thought that the ""harm"" involved in rape was the non-consensual penetration, specifically involving a penis. Assault by Penetration is similar to Rape, covering penetration with anything, but it doesn't cover penetration of the mouth - that would be the catch-all Sexual Assault.

In theory the law isn't gender specific. In practice it is, as men are more likely to have a penis than women. I understand why some people object to these definitions, but I also see what the Government (and in theory Parliament) was thinking when drafting the law.

null,false,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,null,"I reckon it's because we lack two things - self belief and discipline.

Our level of self belief is changing under Poch... I love that we can go into the 85th min in a match a goal down and still win.

But I still don't think the players truly believe they can put opponents away properly, not even shite teams.  So we lack intensity in our play for most of matches, and only seem to ramp it up when we're a goal down and 15 mins from time.

That lack of self belief and intensity means that we're content against QPR to sit on a 2-0 lead, or a 3-1 lead at Swansea, instead of really trying to ram our ascendancy home.  But you know what?  They're not content with it.  So they sense us taking the foot off the pedal, and push, score a goal and then it takes a Lloris wonder-save to prevent us drawing with Swansea at the death.

The problem is that teams above us don't settle for 1- or 2-goal leads.  They continue to be hungry and intense throughout a match, and that's why Utd, Arsenal or Liverpool can win 3-0 or 4-1 without playing particularly well.  They just want it more.

I don't really see that intensity and hunger in our team.  Even in our best performance of the season, against Chelsea, once we went a few goals up we still took the foot off the pedal and they scored three goals against us that they probably didn't much deserve.

We just don't know how to play with intensity and self belief for a full 90 mins.  Some people will say that's because Poch's style of play is so intense and demanding that you can't sustain it over the full 90 mins.  But it's a problem that's been persistent over the last three seasons... it's nothing to do with Poch's style of play.  It's mental conditioning, not physical, that we lack.

In terms of discipline, other posters in here have already explained some of that... too many concentration lapses, and the lack of defensive protection in our midfield means we're always going to be vulnerable, even to relatively crappy sides.",null,0,null,1425851360,null,0,1425851866,0,cp8hvjt,null,t3_2yc77k,null,t1_cp8hvjt,null,t3_2yc77k,null,null,null,1427649947,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

Oscar links up well with Willian, Cesc, Ivanovic Costa, and Hazard. He loves to hold on to the ball and go at defenders. He doesn't beat  a lot of them with skill, but his work rate is unmatched; the mere fact that he's always behind the run of play, tracking back from our half when everyone else is going at goal, is a testament to that. Not to mention his free kick efficiency. 

I want him to show his U20 World Cup form, or his Internacional form, but that's a one way ticket to Mourinho's bench. But Alas, he's scoring goals, and assists aren't that hard to come by for him.

**BRAVOS:**

a. Curtailing the repetitive posts would be great. We don't need a ""where's yedlin"" thread every damn day.  Or four ""OMG &lt;3 Berba"" threads in the same day.  Or five ""I'm new, please save me the horrible burden of reading your very well-made Welcome post"" after every victory.

b. Relatedly, curtailing opinion-specific posts after matches.  I think there is a broad consensus that we want post-match opinions in the post-match thread rather than in their own unique posts, so this is a good rule to put down in writing.

c. Guidelines on titles.  Yes please.  *Can we also ban utterly uninformative titles like ""Quick question."" and ""What do guys think about ..."" that don't actually indicate the topic of the thread?*  We should at least require titles to be as clear as ""What do you think about Lamela's future?""

d. I love the new weekly topical threads.  Free Talk Friday is beautiful and Throwback Thursday is super-value-added.  I also used to really like the weekly player profile we had over the summer.  Thing is, at this point we all know a lot about this season's team. If we could get something like that going again for youth players, or maybe for club staff (especially people running the academy, or even what the hell Steffan Freund or Ledley King have been doing as ambassadors), that would be neat. 

**CRITIQUES:**

a.  Upvote parties. I'll repeat my point about upvote parties that I made in the thread a few weeks ago:  They provide a useful outlet for the pure emotion drivel posts that lots of us like to make.  *Without them that stuff will clutter up the post-match threads*, which ought to be for serious discussion.  The *post-match threads are already huge and cumbersome to read through* and to later go back to read new posts from the few hours since you last read the thread.  The last thing we need is 200 ""GET IN YOU DOLPHIN!"" and ""KANE &amp; THE DANE!!"" posts making the post-match thread even more unwieldy.

So I think we should allow one upvote party per match.  Anything more should be removed as repetitive posting. 

b. I enjoy memes, as do many members of the sub, as long as they're not the same old memes we've had 12 times before.  So maybe we can allow novel memes (even if the OP didn't create it him/herself)? 

**TL;DR:** I agree with most of these guidelines, and offer a couple of minor expansions on them.  I *do* think upvote parties have a place, and are actually helpful for keeping the post-match thread more focused.

Point A: Moffat is not arrogant. He barely praises himself, even when he would have all the right to do it. He's even humble about *Blink*. But of course that doesn't work right with your Tumblr Theory of Moffat being the incarnation of ultimate evil, so you ignore it by choice.

Point B: I've seen at least three people quote the interview as a whole and in parts, and this bit was common to the three of them. I'm sorry to smash your beliefs, but this is definitely a Moffat quote.

Point C: Moffat needs to publicly ask for people to stop being mean to him because of people like *you* who need a *proof* to believe Steven Moffat is a human being. People like you who make no constructive criticisms and simply bash him any time they can.

And let me tell you: he's right to refuse to step down. There are many people who still like him and like what he does, and your silly vocal minority (because that's what you are outside of Tumblr: a minority) should take down a peg or two.

null,false,JackXDark,null,null,null,"'Government' schools, no, not at all. Independent private schools, somewhat although confusingly for colonials, these are called 'Public Schools'. I went to a Naval school that was sort of somewhere in-between a public school and a state school, because it was largely funded by the military, but didn't have the educational standards of a public school.

Most schools are known as comprehensive schools, and don't have any of the attributes you're imagining here. 

Even independent schools put pupils towards GCSEs and A-Levels, which have common syllabuses, so what's being studied is largely the same as at any other school.

I'll answer your points though:

&gt;Strict full suit-and-tie dress code

Sort of. A blazer and grey trousers and tie is more usual. 

&gt;Students separated into ""houses"", and you take all your classes with your house.

Yes and no. I don't think I've ever heard of classes being taken by house. Usually they're by year group, and occasionally by capability streams within these. 

&gt;There is a common room (for non-day students) for each house.

Sometimes. Sometimes it's by year group instead, or several for year groups within each house. Sometimes you have studies where you do your homework outside of class which double as places you go to eat toast/smoke/peruse pronography. 

&gt;There is a captain/prefect for each house

There's usually a head of house and several prefects. Sometimes these prefects only have responsibilities within the house. Sometimes they're nominated by the house but have other responsibilities in the wider school too. My school had its prefect system based on the Royal Navy NCO structure. So you had petty officers, senior petty officers, and chief petty officers, known by the abbreviations PO, SPO, and Chief. Some other schools have similar military rankings from other services used too, or different names for prefects, but the basic idea is the same. 

&gt;Each house has a captain for a respective sport (like football, rugby, etc.) There are many inter-house competitions.

Depends. There's usually one sport per term, depending on the school, which runs as a knockout tournament, for the major sports, with other individual sports having one-offs. My school had a Rugby tournament in Winter, Football in Spring, Athletics in Summer, with sailing, shooting, swimming, and other things like that as one-offs where all house compete in individual large events. You have the captains for each team, but this isn't any sort of big deal. 

Inter-house events are very much secondary to inter-school events though, and house teams don't do much training together, if any. Inter-school sports events are held on Saturdays and there is a hell of a lot of rivalry between certain schools. Violence and foul-play are barely condemned and often covertly condoned by team coaches that are particularly competitive. 

Ignore anyone that tells you that private school Rugby or Hockey are gentlemanly or lady-like endeavours.

If you do well at a sport you can also compete at county or regional or national level. I played Rugby at county level, but going to regional level or further takes a lot of dedication and money as you have to travel for training, keep up your other school work. 

&gt;There is one head boy and head girl for the whole school

Yes. 

&gt;""Double"" classes sometimes, taken with other houses (e.g. ""Double Latin with the Waynfletes"")

Yes and no. Double classes, yes. Never heard of it in house groups. 

&gt;Rigorous study of the Classics, as well as ancient Greek and Latin

No. Classics used to be a requirement for Oxford or Cambridge. They no longer are, so there's less of an emphasis on them. Latin is commonly an optional subject. Greek is more uncommon, and certainly not offered in all schools, but not rare. 

&gt;Deep, sometimes centuries-old traditions, customs, rituals, school songs, etc.

Yes. You also sometimes had notices that went up that said '*From Monday the 15th March, we will be observing the following tradition*'. Which shows how much of a load of old shit they are. Half of the things that are claimed as old traditions were just made up sometime a few years back, and they fade in and out of popularity. 

&gt;Teachers are on a last name basis with their pupils (as in, ""Mr. So and So, what mistake did Louis XII make in 1500 that damaged his alliances with Italian powers and led to France being expelled from Italy by the Swiss in 1511?"")

You'd be lucky to get a 'Mr'. More frequently you're just referred to by your last name. If you've a brother, or if there are others with the same name, you're assigned a number as well. Usually denoted with a Roman Numeral. eg - Phillips I, Phillips II, and referred to as 'Phillips One and Phillips Two'. Sometimes, even if someone with a lower number has left the school, Phillips II would remain Phillips II and subsequent Phillipses would continue to be numbered. I recall situations where there was a Phillips IV and V, but no I, II or III and the system wouldn't reset unless there were no Phillipses in the school at any time. 

&gt;In-depth study of European and British history from the Byzantine Empire up to about 1945 or so

No, just the bits the British won. Actually, history was just like any other curriculum subject.

null,false,Pete-the-meat,null,null,null,"A recommendation you sometimes hear is that when you start paying into a pension, you should pay half your age as a percentage of your income. So if you started paying in at 23 you would pay 11.5% of your salary into a pension, every month until you retire. 

So on that basis, 43% of your annual salary would get you up to speed on your missed contributions - round it up to 50% to include for gains you'll have missed out on and there's your lump sum.
Then start paying in 11.5% every month after that.

But it's all subjective and really you should set a target as to what income you want at retirement and then work out what numbers you need to put in to make it happen. Have a play with a pension calculator like this: https://www.hl.co.uk/pensions/interactive-calculators/pension-calculator

Put in how much you think you could afford as a lump sum (under 'my existing fund'), then put in what you think you could pay in monthly and see how it comes out. Like 99% of the population you'll probably find you're still way off hitting your targets, so play with the numbers to see what it'd take to hit them, see if that's achievable and if so, if you'd actually want to do that or if you'd rather be putting that money away for a house deposit etc...

As to your question of 'where' to  put the money... if your employer offers a contributory pension, take it up and put the money in through there - then you can deduct whatever they pay from your 11.5%.

His writing style is all about making the audience believe he's got something really clever planned and that's what it's all been leading to, only to reach the ending with a dismal conclusion because he never actually thought the pay-off through. My opinions are certainly not the minority as others have clearly vocalised, the Moffat hate across the Internet is overwhelmingly strong.

What I'm saying is that I don't hate Moffat as a person. Moffat is a perfectly normal human being with a job.

One of my biggest ""problems"" with Moffat's writing style is that I don't think that his two-parters are any good.  However, he can write an amazing episode, like Blink.  Blink is my, and many other's favorite episode.  However, you look at something like the most recent season finale, and I am seriously dissapointed with the difference in quality between part 1 and part 2.  Part 1 was brilliant, a spectacular episode, and would be at the top of my favorites list if it weren't for (in my opinion) the train wreck of a second part. Davies, on the other hand, is well-known for his two-part finales that often blew the doors off many other episodes.  ~~Silence in the Library is a great example of this.~~ Silence in the Library was written by Moffat, pick literally any other two-parter in seasons 1-4 and it is most likely written by RTD. 

TL;DR You said that you liked Moffat for what Davies is commonly though to have been/be better at and said that you didn't like Davies because of what Moffat is commonly though to be better at, and I would like to hear your reasoning.

null,false,bobsizzlack,null,null,null,"&gt; Is it possible to make a voluntary contribution to a pension pot large enough to be of the equivalent size as if I'd been putting 10-12% of my salary into a pot since I was 23?

Yes unless you're on a 7 figure wage as the maximum amount you can contribute to a pension in 1 tax year is £40,000 net, and you can do carry forward exercises for a few years if you need to back date and use up allowances you didn't get chance to. 

&gt; I understand that pensions are basically a tax free lump sum of money grown over many years with the help of your employer (free money)

Not quite. Pensions sit in a tax free environment until you draw them, so any growth they gain is tax-free, plus you get tax relief on contributions made by yourself, based on your marginal rate of income tax. Most pensions are invested in the market, though you can buy into government bonds and gilts as well which aren't quite the same as stocks and shares, but I digress. Your employer will be forced to run a scheme for the entire workforce by 2018 (if they haven't already done so), and unfortunately for you unless you're in a position to make the decision for all then you won't be able to choose the exact insurance company your workplace pension will be with, but in most cases you'll be able to choose within their range of funds. It's worth paying into that as you'll get the employer's contribution, which is free money for you. If the scheme really doesn't float your boat then you can always make a personal pension as well and contribute to that personally, and then only put the minimum needed to participate in the workplace scheme.",null,0,null,1425854246,null,0,false,0,cp8jgy5,null,t3_2ych8s,null,t1_cp8jgy5,null,t3_2ych8s,null,null,null,1427650691,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Have you worked out how much (if any) tax you'll need to pay? https://www.gov.uk/tax-property-money-shares-you-inherit

Many years ago I inherited £60k.  I was a bit older than you, and probably with different priorities.  I used it to pay off my debts and put a deposit down for a house.  In your case, I'd be tempted to

* Pay off any debt you owe.
* Max out your ISA.
* Get an instant access savings account and stick a few thousand in there.
* Find a long term home for the rest of the money.

Because you're under 18, I expect you'll be locked out of some of the more ""exciting"" investment opportunities.

You can put up to £40k in Premium Bonds (http://www.nsandi.com/files/published_files/asset/pdf/premium-bonds-brochure.pdf) although I'm not sure if a parent / guardian would need to do that for you.  You *might* win a million quid - or you might have your savings eroded by inflation.

There are also Children's Bonds - http://www.nsandi.com/childrens-bonds - again, you might need a relative to open them up.

I'll give you two small bits of cautionary advice.

1. Don't splash out on a car, holiday, or racehorse straight away.  Think about what you want to do long term. Will this let you study at university?  Will it be seed money for you first company?
2. People get weird about money.  If your friends know you're loaded, it can affect them in funny ways. Some get angry that you won't pay for everything, others will resent your good fortune, a few won't treat you any differently.  Families... well, you know yours better than we do! Will they be angry if they find out that you've been hiding this windfall?

And when it fails, we get 2007/2008. Repeatedly.

First, they won't be able to build a star studded team around him in the way that Barcelona or real can. Regardless of what you think of him as a player, it'd be stupid to think that having 3 or 4 other world class players on the team wouldn't improve his game. The same player, given the same game time at real will have a better chance of winning than at Arsenal. 

Additionally, him playing at Arsenal while they struggle to win trophies will always leave him open to the ""he's good, but what has he won"" argument, which will hurt his chances.

If Alexis was playing like he is now at Barcelona, it's a different story. But no one is going to say that the best player in the world is playing at a team who can't make it past the round of 16 in Europe and considers a champions league birth a successful campaign domestically.

Series 5 was mostly terrible and showed just how dumbed down the show had been to appeal to a younger audience (plus Smith and Gillan's acting was mostly horrible). The transition from everything before it was quite striking and unflattering. Don't get me started on the Power Ranger Daleks who, thankfully, have mostly been abolished now (which actually brings me back to my point about appealing to a younger audience, it's as if those Daleks were designed as toys first and then put into the show.)

I still believe, to this day, that Smith was far too young and inexperienced an actor to have been given the role he was. Gillan had barely had any acting jobs before Doctor Who. They were both a risk. Smith improved somewhat, but Gillan was fairly consistent in her poor acting (although her performance in The Girl Who Waited was very good.)

If we're gonna talk about facts...the facts are that people have been switching off because of Moffat's writing. I've heard hundreds and hundreds of times from people around me, in real life, that they stopped watching Doctor Who after Tennant left because the writing is terrible now (I end up in these conversations because people know I'm a fan of the show.) These are people who weren't even fans and had no commitment to the show. They took an objective view and decided the quality had declined. These people are not extraneous variables. 

This debate is too little too late anyway. We both know Moffat is very near his end as show runner and soon someone new will be given a chance. The show needs it and it cannot come soon enough.

Anecdotal story: When I was younger I took acid alone in the house when my parents were away on holiday. I was having a great time until I heard the front door go and my parents shout my name. Basically they'd come back early from holiday, I was peaking like fuck, totally out of my tree. My trip went from having a great time tripping my box off to absolute terror and from that moment on my night turned into a trip into hell. 

I managed to escape my parents by running out of the back door with them literally chasing after me wondering what the hell was up. I was about 2 seconds from telling them which probably would have resulted in them talking me to hospital worried sick. They were just that way. 

Anyway I managed to escape the house, but I couldn't shake the feelings of dread and paranoia and it lasted for hour after hour thinking they were out looking for me and it would not go away. They weren't, but still, every car that passed and every person on the street was them. 

I could go more into this story ( it's a long one )  but to cut a long story short 'Set and Setting' is absolutely bang on with acid. 

And for that reason I think taking acid on your deathbed could turn your last hours on this earth into an absolutely inescapable nightmare, the ending to which would be your own death.  

Just. No.

Can in defence is great for those exact same reasons, all of the things he does well in midfield are considered worldclass qualities for defender. Dribbling and turning under pressure, passing short and long balls, making runs into space when the other team doesn't pressure higher up the pitch etc.


Ultimately he will remain midfielder, but I think letting him play wingback/wide midfield and CM the last 20-30 minutes will let him get up to pace much better. After all he was on bench for nearly the first half until BR finally found a palace for him.

The thing that annoys me about this attitude is that RTD didn't even really write arcs if you go back and watch. An arc should have some ongoing element of story leading up to something. He just used to stick a random word/phrase into every episode and then come up with an explanation in the last episode.

* Series 1: Bad Wolf - these words literally have no meaning. They just happen to be on a sign in the last episode. There was no clue element. No explanation as to what this might be. No way to theorise or develop the story from noticing the pattern. They could have had them mean anything in the last episode. ""Oh yeah. it turns out that 'The Bad Wolf' is the name of a sex toy that Jack owns and Rose catches him using it and remembers the name.""
* Series 2: Torchwood. It wasn't really relevant in any way to the stories of the episodes in which it was mentioned. If I remember it was established as some kind of group or organisation, but that was it. It's appearances in episodes was entirely separate to the events of those episodes for the most part.
* Series 3: Harold/Mr. Saxon. Again, this was just a word that came up over and over. We knew he was a person/the Prime minister, but he wasn't story relevant. Sure, some people guessed it would be The Master, but that was just typical fan guessing rather than piecing together clues or story points. They could just as easily have had it turn out to be Davros, or the Valeyard, or another Doctor without changing anything in the episodes leading to the finale.
* Series 4: They mention like 3 missing planets in different contexts throughout the series. That's it. There's even less to go on there than normal. There's not even really a suggestion that they're linked as they're all mentioned loosely in different contexts.

Next when I was working as a manager at a cinema we had Irish travelers that started to come fairly regularly and they were constantly trying to sneak into cinema screens without paying, trying to trick staff to give them money or free food (often picking on the most vulnerable young staff member), were often extremely disruptive in the films and in more than one case being extremely aggressive to staff (which meant we had to get security).  They would also just dump their kids in the cinema for hours with no money every Sunday so they could go get pissed in the pub across the road (until they got barred).  Thirdly when they moved onto some local public land where dogs were walked (a different location to the first) by cutting through a chain link fence and basically told everyone they were no longer welcome to come there and made a point of trying to intimidate anyone that did.  When someone did ignore them and tried to walk on the field two of them tried to run his dog over with a car and when they failed they tried to beat the guy up (luckily he was ex-forces and knew how to handle himself).

Again you're selecting children on some criteria other than their own merit.

The guy was out cold for on the field for at least three minutes, and this isn't the first head injury we've seen him sustain. I know he's a warrior and I know you don't want your guys to get taken off the field easily, but post-concussion syndromes like CTE are a thing and being allowed to play on after sustaining  a concussion is extremely dangerous.

Head injuries like the one Skrtel sustained today need to be taken *very* seriously and he shouldn't be allowed back on the pitch until he passes a thorough protocol.

My Mom loved the show when she was a kid and tried to share it with me but I was too young. The I saw the nu who on Netflix a little over a year ago and binge watched all of it. Sometimes a whole season in one sitting. I got caught up on 11's last episode. I waited patiently for the new season and watched it episode to episode. The point I'm trying to make is I love the show, all of it. 

Would I like them to change the Doctor's gender? No not particularly but that's because I am a guy and I identify more with male protagonists. Would I quit watching the show if they did change the gender? Probably not.

The whole show is good I'm not saying every episode is great but it doesn't have to be.

I watch it because I like it. It isn't always what I want but that's ok because even if they wrote an episode where the Doctor showed up at my house,met me, and take me on a journey through time and space it still wouldn't play out how I pictured it

I guess what I'm trying to say is if you like the show continue to watch the show. If the show is becoming something you don't like please stop watching it and leave those of us who still enjoy it alone!

I'd recommend not telling anyone about this. I'm assuming that your family already knows? But don't talk to friends about it. As soon as you tell a 15 year old that you've got loads of money, they'll treat you completely differently, and it'll make your life much more difficult than it needs to be.

Then, I'd recommend making a plan from what others have said here (and a fixed fee financial advisor). Then, put your money away, and don't touch it until you need to. Stay with family until you go to uni (if that's what you want to do), then take student loans and act like you never got any money. If you start taking from it here and there over the next few years, it'll make a big difference. Plan what you need now, and leave the rest growing for a few years. When you need it, say to buy a house, it'll make a massive difference, taking off 10 years of a mortgage payment easy? It might not sound exciting now, but that's huge. Much more important than buying a new CPU or something.

Arthur's super-serious clap in that first bit made me laugh.

Gaius is so sassy with Merlin, I love it. The comment last week about his head not fitting in a pointy hat, and this week he's poking fun when Merlin's all googly-eyed over ""Kara"".

Arthur is too cute, dressing Merlin up in the silly outfit. NOBODY else is wearing that, Arthur, we all know it's just for your own personal lolz!

Morgana makes me really sad in these early episodes. She's so sweet and good, and such a big factor in turning Arthur into not-a-douche. [spoiler] (/s She should have turned out so different. =()

Uther, however, is very much a douche. I get his point about Arthur's life being worth more than Merlin's, I really do. But it's so important to Arthur to save him, and Uther completely disregards his feelings. And that ""I'm proud of you"" crap in the end is just mean. I also don't know how that guy maintains a hold on his kingdom, doing things like trapping peasants in the lower city to die, fanatically killing anyone who has any passing contact with magic, and forcing poison on people who save his kid's life.

When I watch a show/movie or read a book I like to pick ones that I could imagine myself in the lead part.  And since I'm not a woman, I can't imagine being one.  So I prefer ones that are male-led.   And YES, he would still be a 1300 year old MALE in a woman's body.  The doctor changes a bunch of things when he regenerates, but he is still a man and he has been for 1300 years.  You think that after 1300 years of being a man, the transition wouldn't be difficult?  Please tell me you're not that stupid.  He doesn't get a full memory wipe.  If he DID, I could see you having a point.  But he doesn't, it's gone for a few hours and it starts to come back.  Also you need to look at this as the actor, not just the character, changing.  Women have ""women"" mannerisms, you can't make the argument that they don't...  Sexual dimorphism is a thing in humans, which means the genders are fundamentally different.  They're built differently with different muscle mass and bone structure (how forensic scientists can tell the difference between skeletons).  The bodies are shaped differently so they walk with a different gait.  They carry themselves differently.  The shoulders are more narrow.  They're usually smaller.  I could go on...

Also, since when is there a ""women's day""?  When is ""men's day""?  Isn't Valentine's day enough for women?  They need ""sweetest day"" and ""women's day"" and ""mother's day"" as well?  Hell, I'm surprised men even have ""father's day"" (which in my experience, not one single dad gives a fuck about).

Leave the Doctor's gender alone, and create a spin-off with a female Time Lord.  Watch it implode in less than one season...  I guarantee it.

Not to mention, the dynamic between The Doctor and the Companion has always been the driving force of the show.  If there was a male companion to a female doctor, it would be a nightmare.  Him constantly trying to bang her, and her constantly being like - ""You know I was a guy a year ago, right?"".  Then they get into a sticky situation with how he responds to that.  Either way half the audience would get pissed.  It's better to not fuck with a winning formula.  Let the Master be a woman.

Rights wise it's pretty similar to the US. If arrested you have the right to a lawyer and the right to remain silent. You'll get a phone call at the police station. 

I've heard a few times on Reddit about Americans being arrested for public intoxication - I've never heard of that here.

You don't have the right to use lethal force to defend your property. Otherwise it's very much a grey area. You can defend yourself and your property but expect to find yourself explaining it in a court.

When you design interfaces put your self in the user shoes.

For example I want to search for jobs available for my skill let's say python.

So as soon as I come to your site if under your search box you show me python, I quickly click on it n get wat I want i.e results for hiring with python skills. I love your site and share it to others.

But I come on your site n you show me a search box, I don't know wat to search for, I just try type in python but i get results forhire and they results show me 3 months back data where the positions might have already been filled I dont like your site

Also check what competitors have done like http://www.monster.com/

Social Sciences puts you in George Square, I reckon. It's a good central location in the city. 

Lots of students live in the neighborhood south of George Square and around the Meadows. I've friends there, Morningside (even further south), and along Holyrood Road (the eastern leg of Cowgate). 

Uni housing is typical uni housing. I'm in it, and am glad I did for the people I've met and the lack of having to shop around physically in town. UoE does have housing only for postgrads and flats for couples. However there's lot to be said for non-uni housing. There are private flats and more dorm-type buildings that'll be full of students. 

Pro's: Gorgeous city, very walkable. Decent nightlife and things to do for students, but you get out what you put in (as is with most things). 
Con's: Big concerts don't really happen here. You'll have to go to Glasgow for that.

You say it's notional because nobody pays it, I say it exists because everybody pays it.

Deposits in the UK are paid net of 20% income tax. Is this notional for a basic rate taxpayer because they never actually write a cheque to HMRC?

The 10% tax credit is in respect of the corporation tax already paid on the profits from which dividends arise.

It is technically incorrect to state that Stocks &amp; Shares ISAs are tax-free for this reason. It just so happens that the tax paid is unavoidable (since 2006, from memory, when Gordon Brown removed the ability for non-taxpayers/PEPs to reclaim).

Though saying that, years ago at the restaurant I used to work at, we had a table run out without paying. I wasn't on shift that day and my other half was walking back to our place after having been at the pub. The police stopped him because he matched the description of one of the table party and he had to spend about 30 minutes convincing them that it would be extremely dumb of him both to do a runner without paying anyway, and also to do it at the place his missus worked. So I guess if something random gets reported then police might be on the lookout for people to stop and ask, but unless you match a particular description or are behaving oddly, I can't see why it'd be you.

A Sponge is a type of cake - it's light and moist and looks like a sponge, hence the name. It's the base for a wide variety of cakes and toppings, but it's most commonly called sponge when served with a jam filling and a dusting of icing sugar.

Pies here refer only to main course dishes - traditionally these were made in a large bowl filled with cubed meat of some variety, some vegetables and stock, covered with a pastry lid (either shortcrust or puff pastry). These days, the pie has evolved to routinely have pastry sides as well, and common fillings are fish (fisherman's pie is a favourite, topped with mashed potato instead of pastry, and with no pastry sides), mincemeat (again topped with mashed potato), chicken &amp; gravy, chicken &amp; wine (usually white), chicken &amp; mushroom, steak and ale, steak &amp; gravy etc etc. Pies also include pork pies, which are a traditional staple - these are usually small, and are packed with pork and pork gelatin, and can be enjoyed cold or hot.

null,false,Colvestone,null,null,null,"Some answers to your post and secondary question:

There are a few current accounts that pay better interest than the the Santander 123. I currently hold all of the below.

1. Club Lloyds. If your balance is &gt; 4000, you earn 4% on the entire balance that is &lt; 5000. (If you have &lt; 4000 interest rates are lower). You can deposit as much as you like but any money in excess of the 5000 will not earn you any interest. (I.e. there's no point keeping &gt; 5000 in club lloyds.)
2. [TSB classic plus](http://www.tsb.co.uk/current-accounts/classic-plus-account/) - 5% on anything up to 2000. You can have **two** of these (at least when I signed up)
3. [Halifax reward current account](https://www.halifax.co.uk/bankaccounts/current-accounts/reward-current-account/?WT.mc_id=&amp;WT.srch=1). You get £5 a month however much money there is in it. Also there's a switching bonus.
4. [Nationwide flexdirect](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/current-accounts/landing-page/flexdirect?ppc=1&amp;cmpid=PaidSearch_114490&amp;gclid=CP-A0pqMm8QCFSX3wgodjpgA4Q). 5% interest on up to £2500.

Most of these have various conditions about payments in each month, using switching services, and direct debits, but these are pretty easily fulfillable. (You **can** move the same money around different accounts and it will count as 'income' - as long as it's between different banks).

&gt; First Direct's £125 reward for joining - can I open this account, collect the bonus and close it a month later?

Yes (I haven't closed mine yet but I got the bonus and transferred it out, so I can't forsee any problems when I do).

&gt; I have a further £4,000 in a awful ISA that is making nothing

Makes sense to put this ISA money in one of these current accounts, there's no cash ISA that's better than the top current account rates. (Unless possibly you're a higher rate taxpayer).

The advantage of the Santander one is that you can stick all your money in there and don't have to think about it, with these other ones it takes a bit of admin to sort it out as you have to split your cash between various accounts - however it will maximise your interest. Although practically £5000 at 5% isn't going to make you more than about £15 a month. I found it quite interesting setting up all the accounts and payments, but if you're looking at a strict time invested vs financial reward basis it may not be worth it.

The amount of commentary and opinion that accompanies this kind of issue which glosses over the fundamental differences is infuriating. People see 'selling off' and bring out their issues with normal privatisation and don't seem to know or care if such complaints are relevant to the issue they're talking about. 

Eurostar is already a private company. It's just one the Government owned shares in. Selling it off doesn't mean privatising a national asset to shareholders who'll dismantle the company. It means selling off our shares in a private company. The difference is important because the benefits of a nationalised service don't apply in this case, we can't force them to service unprofitable routes, we don't get an insurance of service and we already have prices set to turn a profit for shareholders - that's how the Government get their cut in the first place. 

Lastly the shares are not certain to rise in value or always return a dividend. Having an investment in Eurostar is a risk. It could go down as well as up. In fact Eurostar lose their monopoly on the line next year and a German company will operate a rival service. This could mean a reduction in value for the state in which case selling it now may prove to have been wise. Especially since they beat city expectations on the value they could raise.

By all means debate if selling off the shares is a wise decision but let's stop this economic illiterate attempt to position this as a nationalised service that is being privatised. It isn't. I know everyone has a copy and pasted argument about the evil Tories selling off the state but at least modify it to incorporate the difference. The shares are still a 'national asset' but the company isn't and the Eurostar is not a nationalised service.

ISIS always has been and always will be an anti-Shia organisation. Their goal is to create a Sunni caliphate of their own to control, and their main target from the beginning has been Shia Muslims.

to be honest, most of us don't really know what that signifies. I think we are familiar with some accents due to TV and movies (Texas, general traits of Southern Accents, New York, Boston, maybe California) but telling us you're from Chicago is just the same as my mate telling you she's from Birmingham. You probably don't know much because Birmingham's most well-known TV portrayal is in a netflix show about a gang from the 20s. All I know about chicago is people die on Valentine's day :).

When she said ""A guy from New York is not the same as a guy from Texas."" she means that we don't generally stereotype Americans as one thing. Well we do, but it's a joke, and if we meet an American we can tend to leave stereotypes in the garage and talk to you like human beings.

As for the rest of your question, not many people find American accents sexy or cute. There's definitely some but it's not an easy find.

Radical Islamism is the new fascism.  It's a cult of death, which would result in the end of civilization if it ever got any power.

There is no moral comparison with Tory policy or David Cameron.  I've never liked the Conservatives, but get a grip.  This government legalized gay marriage.  Compare that to radical Islamists who would quite happily execute every homosexual in the country without feeling even the slightest remorse.

null,false,mallardtheduck,null,East Midlands,null,"The Eurostar thing is a complete red herring, it's government selling its share in an already private company, it's not a ""privatisation"" in any meaningful sense. Since Eurostar is losing its monopoly soon, which will likely lower their value, it's probably a good idea to sell now.

However, in a more general sense, privatisation of public-sector functions has become something of a necessary evil over the last couple of decades. There's a reason why the previous government were as keen on it (if not more so) than the current one.

The key problem is pensions. After WW2, the UK was pretty much bankrupt, but long-term projections were positive. This meant that employers (including the government) couldn't afford high wages at the time so instead offered generous salary-based pension schemes. Over time, the economy has changed making these schemes much more expensive and in the private sector the vast majority of these schemes have, as the very least, closed to new members. In the public sector, however, the unions have fought tooth-and-nail to prevent that happening, leaving the government saddled with a _huge_ and ever-increasing pension liability. The cost to the taxpayer has more than doubled over the last 20 years and will only continue to go up.

This leaves the government with only two real options; go head-to-head with the unions (impossible for Labour, since they rely on the unions for funding and still pretty much suicidal for even the strongest Conservative leadership) or reduce the number of people directly employed by the government. By contracting out the formerly public-sector work to private companies, even with the proviso that transferred employees keep their (government-funded) pensions, they effectively close the expensive pension schemes to new members and reduce the future liability. That's why even the previous Labour government was privatising every low-profile thing they could think of (leaving the headline-grabbing stuff for the Conservatives) and Labour don't currently have any serious plans to re-nationalise anything (except possibly the railways, where privatisation was primarily done for different reasons - to raise funds to cover the cost of replacing life-expired trains).",null,0,null,1425902856,null,0,false,0,cp91cge,null,t3_2yfcq8,null,t1_cp91cge,null,t3_2yfcq8,null,null,null,1427659240,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

As of the 6th of April a new set of regulations will be introduced which mean that my job is erased within six months because it cannot be performed by a consultant with an independent role in the project team, with some minor duties falling to the client and most now being carried out by a design practice (generally an architects firm). The problem for my employer is that the law will state that the duties must only be carried out by a designer, meaning that half of our current workload will cease within 6 months. 

For me specifically the problem is that my job will be reduced to, at best, being a health and safety paperwork monkey for an architects firm (meaning a likely drastic pay cut, loss of advancement opportunities, the rendering useless of six years CPD and much less meaningful labour), and that's assuming I'm able to get into a design practice because competition will be fierce. For the industry as a whole the problem is that clients will no longer given independent advice from specialists and that the introduction of independent consultants such as myself correlated to significant improvements in accident rates within the industry.

&gt; Labour were not profligate. Debt to GDP was lower before the recession than when Labour took office and the current balance was almost zero.

You have to be kidding. We had an inflated economy due to debt mixed with reasonably strong economic growth of course the figures looked good. Most of it evaporated in 2008.

Watch/listen/read each Labour budget after 2001 (when they dropped the commitment to keep to Tory spending plans) they hyperbole gets as ridiculous as the spending plans. Sure the UK needed some investment and a very stong case could have been made to relax the Tory policies from pre-1997 but Labour went mad, in addition to the debt they also sold off a lot of assets.

No, it's worth the brick and mortar and a little land. However land prices have spiraled out of control. This false evaluation on house makes people want to buy houses as an INVESTMENT.

Comparing travelling expenses to JSA is such a ridiculously faulty, unfair and improper comparison it's not funny.

Most people go home at the end of the day and can cook, using ingredients they have bulk-bought at value prices.

Someone who is required to split their time between two offices is going to have higher costs than that average person.

My girlfriend's brother is an electrician - he has no fixed ""office"" as obviously he moves from site to site with each job.

But each day he can come home and cook. If the company sends him off on a big contract sufficiently far away that he needs to stay in a B&amp;B during the week, he does indeed get a meal allowance for an evening meal, and to buy stuff for lunch.

MPs are in that odd position of spending a huge amount of their time away from home, and incur costs accordingly.

They spend substantial time at both, and therefore are going to incur substantial travel and subsistence expenses for whichever one they are not based at. Unless they claim for a second home, which is equally bad for the taxpayer.

£20/day for 200 days (which is way more than most non-London MPs would spend in London) is £4k, which is a lot less than renting a London apartment!

In this case, the guy has claimed for a second home, so should be cooking for himself and not claiming subsistence allowances, but the notion that £20/day is in any way unreasonable for an ""away from office"" food allowance is wrong.
