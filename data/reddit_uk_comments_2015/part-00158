null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"i think it's a combo of everything. it's not one thing and not the other. our lack of transfer business at the top end/attacking end of the pitch really hurt us. lallana being hurt all season hasn't really helped us either as he has been great for us when he's been on a healthy run of matches. 

i think br has dealt with a lot of 'lemons' so to speak which include injuries, suspensions, extra match load, some dud transfers, etc...every manager goes through this and i think he made some mistakes. now with that said, he has shown me many flashes that he can be the right guy going forward, and i believe 100% whole heartedly that he is, but this is his make or break season. we have a squad, we are tying down our core key players down (ibe, skrtel and sterling are 3 of the remaining guys i would like to see us tie down), we are extremely young (without gerrard, jones, toure and glenjo our average age comes out to be around 23.5 years of age), and we have a young manager. i think if we sign 3-4 players, 2 of which are starters for us (cm, striker and rb would be my focus and where i would throw most of our money) and bring up some more of the youth for cups and such, we can perform very well next season. early FA cup, early league cup and europa league group matches against lower quality teams should be for younger players/players who need fitness and matches and we should really be putting a lot of focus on the league in the first half of the season. in the second half of the season, our top XI need to be playing as much as possible and granted we're still in cups, we need to go for as many trophies as possible. i think after this summer, we can plausibly have two sets of starting XI's that can perform adequately to continue progressing in big games. i hope the message to lfc players has been that we never want to feel the disappointment of losing while not putting our best foot forward, and that this team develops an edge to their game, an aggression we have been lacking. leaders like can, sahko, lovren, migs, skrtel, hendo need to step up and elevate this team. 

anyways, a long rant indeed, but i think it is partially dud transfers, partially good long term transfers that weren't supposed to impact the ""now"" and manager folly that contributed to our ""flatness"" this year...but with a golden opportunity to tie down the most important pieces to our current squad and add 3-4 more players who will make an impact, this is truly a make or break season for us. i hope we can get just one summer right. all of the contracts are a good start, lock down ibe and skrtel ASAP and get sterling done early in the summer. sign our players early and have them on preseason (without WC, should be easier)...im optimistic, and will be the first to say BR needs to go if we start off like we did this season.

null,false,Lorikcana,null,null,null,"I'm a Marseille fan let me tell you my opinion of imbula. First of all, he is NOT a tough tackling midfielder or a makalele type as the guardian says.

Imbula plays ahead of the defense usually with a more defensive mid next to him. He is very technical, I'm not the biggest fan of stats but iirc he lead ligue 1 in successful dribbles ahead of veratti and ntep. He has very good passing, long and short. And he's tall and physically strong, he's good at breaking lines and getting past opponents. He also has a good shot from far. He was one of the best players in France's youth squad along with kondogbia, Kurzawa, and ntep who failed to qualify for youth euros. 

Now to his negative parts. He is almost exclusively left footed. His good technique lets him get his left free, but he relies too much on it. He needs to improve defensively  for a defensive mid. He has a reputation of not having the best attitude.

As an Om fan I can say 20m£ for imbula is too much. He's too old to be a bet. He's a good player but I don't think he's the elite level Chelsea want.

I just had a couple of other thoughts that might be handy if it's your first time:

* If you are looking to rent a three bed apartment together but haven't found it yet, give some thought to how you will get in there. Landlords have different rules they need to follow if they rent a property to multiple individuals as opposed to one person taking on the tenancy and subletting. Will one person have the tenancy or will each of you have a separate contract with the landlord?

* Depending on which of the above tenancy arrangements you have, you will also need to budget for fees as well if you haven't already - just getting the keys to a flat can be quite expensive with fees, credit checks and other things estate agents stick on top.

* Final point that might be useful from my own years as a member of generation rent - spend some time educating yourself about your rights a a tenant - this is especially important in regards to your deposit you pay the landlord. Landlords have strict rules they need to follow in relation to your deposit, and many don't - but a lot of people don't know this and feel there is nothing they can do if their landlord withholds their deposit unfairly - but there is.

Apologies if you knew all this already!

Across this period of about 13 centuries, one historian has estimated a total of 17 million slaves transported, compared to 11 million in the Atlantic slave trade.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"The thing here is that he's largely correct. What he's ignoring is context and this is because he's not a markets person he's an economist.

Back in 2011-12 we were in the midst of a full blown sovereign debt crisis. During this time the markets were punishing any country that wasn't seen as cutting their deficit or at least being serious about cutting their deficit. [Here's a chart of European bond yields during the period](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/bond-yields-oct-12-fr-it.png). Note Spain and Italy were the countries seen as 'least' serious about cutting their deficits.

What made matters even worse is that the ratings agencies like S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch who had been massively criticized for rating subprime mortgages so highly in 06-08 became overly zealous in 11-12. [They nearly caused another full blown crisis when they downgraded the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_%282011%29). My opinion of ratings agencies is very low by the way.

What Simon Wren-Lewis is abusing though is the benefit of hindsight. It's obvious now that we could have loosened the fiscal belt and gone for growth but they opted for safety. Don't forget we'd just had one of the worst financial crises of all time. People were terrified.

What is very interesting though and what not a lot of people are picking up on is that I actually think the Tories are quietly giving up on austerity. I think Osborne has clued into the fact that it is no longer the time for it. I think they're also trying to flag this to people by not costing a number of their key policies.

They obviously can't tell the electorate this though as they've spent 5 years telling everyone austerity was necessary. And it was at one point,  but not anymore.

I'll end up on Simon Wren-Lewis. It's easy for economists to appear like heroes and cheery pick data that backs their point of view. Don't forget though that he is deliberately leaving out certain things and he is not a markets person. He doesn't understand markets. Just take a look at Varoufakis and what he's done in Greece. [He's become so embarassing they've had to sideline him.](http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/27/greek-finance-minister-debt-talks-eurozone-live) and yet at one point he was being called a ['rockstar'](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11388263/Greeces-rock-star-finance-minister-Yanis-Varoufakis-defies-ECBs-drachma-threats.html)

Anyway I know this will sound like a bit of a cop out but I have a savage flu and I need to be in work at 3.30am tomorrow so I don't think i'll be writing any particularly long replies to the inevitable one's i'm going to get.

I read the first paper and I feel that I might have missed something; it generally concludes that Same Sex Families are equal in child outcomes in comparison to Opposite Sex families, but it says nothing about children raised by lesbian couples coming out *better*. Your second paper's abstract seems to paint a similar viewpoint.

As for wikipedia, [I believe I found](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/126/1/28.full) the paper you were referencing, but it doesn't seem to stand up. All of the couples had children via insemination, ignoring adoption, the outcome of the children was based on the parent's subjective interpretation (as far as I can see, no objective method like IQ scores were used), and they were compared to a sample that varied widely in race, socio-economic status, and where they lived, whilst the sample of lesbian couples was mostly white, college educated, and middle to upper class, earnings on average being around $85,000.

The next season he got to the cup final but was a bit shit in the league. The club was already selling players for good money Rosicky or getting big earners off the books Metzelder and investing in youth. Klopp came into a club that were back on a sound financial footing and had a team playing in the largest stadium in the country where they were still getting huge crowds, despite being a bit shit. 

Now despite a strange first season when Dortmund finished 6th with the 3rd best attack and the 2nd best defence, Klopp has been fucking amazing. But by 2010/11 the first title win, they were able to compete with all bar Munich in Germany. The fact is that if you have 80,000 paying supporters every other week, and you suddenly stop paying stoopid cash to dead wood, then you'll be a financial powerhouse fairly quickly.

Okay my point at the beginning of all this was that while Klopp is a great manager and someone that I would love to see in our dugout, I can't stand the whole, we're like Dortmund so he'll do with us what he did with them comparisons. 

We're in a slightly worse position than Dortmund were then. We're just back to being profitable, Dortmund had been for a few seasons. Dortmund had huge revenue streams from matchday and commercial interests. We do get a lot of money from TV and a lot of new commercial deals. However, Dortmund really only had one 'Rich' club above them, we have 4. Dortmund had a league that had bought into the mid 00 German obsession with youth development and a good few clubs that didn't have a lot of money which meant they were able to get players like Rues, Subotic, Gundogan, etc. Only Rues cost a lot of money around £15mill.

English clubs all get a lot of TV cash so can quote £15mill for average players like Young, Adam Johnson, Downing, Scott Sinclair, Rodwell, etc.",null,0,null,1430161223,null,0,false,0,cqqj5bx,null,t3_33f2m8,null,t1_cqqj5bx,null,t1_cqqb7hi,null,null,null,1432635604,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

That is such terrible logic, it isn't even logic at all, you are just saying I support the conservatives and then literally trying to demonize other parties. I also personally don't agree that dismantling the country while the economy has essentially stagnated or at least did for a long period, especially compare to places like Germany, is doing a pretty good job, they seem to be taking the infrastructure apart and then not adding more in. 

Now if they were dismantling the country and the economy was rolling along like Germany, fair game, they are doing great, but it isn't, the economy isn't great, and services that people now need due to it not being great are being cut, that is the opposite of what should be happening, and the whole ""lowering the deficit"" rubbish, this country has been around for hundreds of years, there is no need to pay off its debts in the next 2, the idea that you do is just propaganda for cutting stuff because that is what the conservatives like to do. 

I am far more a fan of the idea that this government was mediocre at best and most likely slightly worse than average and therefore another option is more probably going to be better. They seem to have moved towards an American style model, rather than ones that statistically have been shown to give a better quality of life, i.e. Scandinavian and European ones.

Two sentences back they say ""The SNP has shown a taste for centralisation"".

The Scottish Lib Dems have an obsession with the SNP's '[centralisation obsession](http://www.scotlibdems.org.uk/lib_dems_slam_snp_over_centralisation)', largely based on playing up the idea that the Holyrood means Edinburgh is somehow stealing autonomy away from the Highlands and Islands (the Lib Dem's base in Scotland).

Police Scotland is their most common target for this, and this article is pretty much recycling it verbatim without applying any critical thought.

&gt; You also don't address the comments around schools, which are undeniably more independent in England (not sure if wales get academies?).

They are undeniably more independent in England, however in Scotland school funding is the responsibility of local authorities. The Scottish Government gives them funding for education, how much of it they spend on education is up to the council.

Bear in mind that the Scottish educational system is quite different to that in England and Wales. There are far larger differences than how it's funded, however the article seems to have glossed over that.

&gt; Opinions differ on whether either are a good thing, I'd suggest that a single police force in scotland is likely to have a tendency to focus attention (and consequently budget) onto certain areas at the expense of others. Although this might have happened previously doing it on a national basis seems asking for trouble. Policing the highlands is likely to be significantly different to policing central Glasgow.

A lack of local involvement was one of the problems with the previous structure, and one that the Police Scotland structure explicitly addresses.

Local authorities now have a direct relationship to local policing and there's a new Scottish Police Authority that sits above the police themselves, which they can raise issues with if they're unhappy with either their local police commander or Police Scotland's Chief Constable.",null,1,null,1430162686,null,0,false,0,cqqk4sl,null,t3_340rew,null,t1_cqqk4sl,null,t1_cqqgx02,null,null,null,1432636069,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

As a person who doesn't support the conservative I agree with this point, Labour just built government up to a redundantly useless level, making jobs and QUANGO's for the sake of it isn't useful, the government needed to be cut down. But was anyone arguing that the NHS needed taking apart? Was anyone arguing that the Police were over funded across the whole country? Was anyone arguing that the disabled were getting too much money? Sure some efficiency could have been added to the police, maybe the disabled allowance wasn't perfect, but to just indiscriminately cutting isn't a solution to that. 

This is one of the reason that politics is cyclical, firstly due the cyclical nature of the economy and people just arbitrary blaming the government when it tanks, and then because Labour goes and taxes everyone through the hilt and wastes it all through inefficiency, then conservatives come in and just cut everything apart until there is nothing left. 

The problem this time is that labour was in power, the economy tanked, which was absolutely nothing to do with government it was a international crash caused by the American banking system, so the Conservative get their turn right? Except that a lot of people realised that cutting stuff right when people need it isn't a good thing to do, people are suffering you don't cut the lifeline and let them drift into the sea as soon as they need it.

Many scalpers were asking 100 pounds and I told them I only had 60 for the match. As kick off approached I went into a fish and chips spot across from the stadium and one of the fella's I asked about buying a single ticket from followed me in and said it was my lucky day and sold me a ticket in the Ani road end for 60 quid.

null,false,square13,null,null,null,"HMRC would disagree with you on this, the link below compares total relative incomes (which I presume would include income from investments) against contributions to the total income tax bill. So the top 1% paid 29.8% of all income tax in 2013-2014 from total earnings of 13.7% relative to the rest of the country. 

The top 1% have seen their burden of income tax increase by 4.3% of the total income tax bill over the course of this government. This means that the top 1% are paying ~18-19% more in tax than they were in 2010, whilst their share of the income initially dropped and has now returned to around the same level it was at 2010.

I note that the report dictates 'total income' which I presume must mean income from investments etc but it then only compares to income tax, so I'm not sure if this even includes CGT which the top groups will pay most of, in which case their relative tax burden to the rest of us would be even higher I imagine.

I feel like statements like yours get thrown around this subreddit quite a lot, and they don't really seem to be backed up by anything but rhetoric and bluster which has quite obviously been peddled to you by people who are either ill-informed or are being deliberately misleading to suit a political agenda. You may think that the top 1% should pay more than 30% of income tax, that is another matter, but the argument that they don't pay more than their relative share to the rest of us doesn't really have much merit.

oops heres the link: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140206164307/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/tax-statistics/table2-4.pdf

Also, capital gains tax is different in that by its nature it needs to be competitive. Income tax is another matter because most of us get paid monthly and need that money to live on and fund our lives, and we have no choice in paying the tax. Capital gains tax you very much have a choice in paying or not, provided you are not in a financial emergency. You can either sell and realise your gain and pay CGT or you can hold your investment, if CGT is too high people end up holding when otherwise they might sell if they didn't have to pay so much CGT and so you end up losing quite a lot of tax revenue.

TL DR: HMRC figures show that over the last 5 years the relative tax burden of the top 50% of earners has increased, with those in the top 1% and top 10% increasing substantially. Their relative tax bill is much higher than their relative incomes, the bottom 50% have seen their relative tax burden decrease and their relative incomes increase.

null,false,GuzBear,swans2002,Thanks For Everything Bony!,null,"**Rudy Gestede:**

I like the guy, but he has no experience in high level leagues. It has been seen with many players coming up from the championship but unable to continue the form from the championship to the Premier league. I feel as though he has the physicality and aerial ability to compete in the premier league, but is he a 20 goal a season premier league striker, I don't think he will. He is a good player, and if we can get him for 4-5 million he would be a good buy. Then again I could be wrong. Many people thought Michu and Bony weren't going to be successful but look at them. I'm being quick to judge, so I'll shut up.

**Maciej Rybus:** 

Don't know very much about him. Are there any Polish Swansea fans here that could give us an insight. I've seen a few clips of him, he looks quick and good on the ball. What we need from him is good ability to cross a ball, so if he has that ability I don't see why his purchase should be a problem. However, again, the league he plays in isn't necessarily a big league, but he does have international experience and so could be a good purchase.

**Franck Tabanou:**

I really like the look of this player, again only really seen from videos. His crossing looks on point and he has a cracking shot. He is a good suitable starter for left back, but what would that mean for Neil? A player I really like. He would be an excellent purchase but it depends whether St. Etienne would want to sell him considering he is important for them. With the right price we could get him, but is he worth 6-10 million, that's the question? Also, with his purchase it would be likely that Neil could leave who would probably seek first team football considering he is an international player who really hasn't done anything wrong this season. His importance to the team has been shown in the last two games, don't get me wrong Amat is brilliant, just not a full-back!

**Christian Fuchs:**

As a man who regularly watches German football, good for my German skills :P, I can say this player is a quality left back. He might have less pace than Neil, but he is a hell of a good left-back who can whip a ball in well. He is a solid option, likes to get forward and considering he is out of contract he would be free, apart from the more than likely high wages, and for this reason, personally I'd like to see him at the Liberty. Again, however, I really don't want to see Neil go and, again, I doubt Fuchs wants to play fringe to Neil Taylor. Fuchs is 29 and so some people could see him as an ageing player, meaning his pace and finesse is lacking, but I'd be quick to point out Dani Alves, 31 or 32 years of age, who is still a quality right-back. Of course Franc Tabanou is younger at 26, so Monk could see him as a better player for the future so to speak, but Fuchs could do great things with Swansea, if only in the short term. 

**Andre Pinto:**

I don't really know anything about Pinto. The one thing I do know is it seems to be reported he has an attitude problem, and we don't want that at Swansea. He is quite young at 25, and recently got a call up to the Portuguese national team, in which he got sent off. However, we already have depth in the centre back positions and I really don't see the point in looking for others, we have Fede and Ashley, who are top quality CBs, and then we have Bartley and Amat, who are both also strong CBs that haven't really under-performed when called upon, so, no I don't really want to see Pinto being bought because it could lead to one of our other, younger, more disciplined centre backs leaving the club, so, no to this one for me I'm afraid.

**Aleksander Mitrovic:**

It has been widely seen throughout this sub-reddit that we really want  this player to be our starting striker. He has a great record for  Anderlecht, not to mention Champions league experience to his name, notorious for netting against Arsenal in the champions league at the emirates. He is the perfect striker for us. Young, looking to the future, able in front of goal, 22 goals in 40 games for Anderlecht this season, strong, we need our strikers to hold position especially when playing our old favourite the 4-2-3-1, and good in the air, we need our strikers to win headers and look for an out option when pressured at the back. He fits all the bills, so to speak, but the question is, would he rather go to a bigger team in search of champions league football. He wouldn't get regular football at a champions league club, but at ours he would, but if a big teams come calling, I doubt he'll come to 'little old Swansea' as perceived by the Media. I would really like him to come to the club, as would a lot of this sub-reddit, so I hope he makes us happy and comes to South Wales in the summer.

**Luc Castaignos:**

We've been linked with this guy for 2 seasons is it now? He is young, scored a decent amount of goals but when he went to Inter on loan, he didn't really do anything. If there are any people that follow Castaignos please let me know if he is a good enough player for the premier league, but from what I've seen I don't think he should be our first choice transfer, but if we lose out we could risk it and give it a go, like we risked it with Michu and Bony.

**Leo Baptistao:**

Plays in a big team, obviously doesn't get many opportunities there, but he could be worth a shot. He is out of contract in the summer and we could give it a go he has been in decent form after going on loan at Rayo Vallenco, 7 in 17 games. He isn't as good in the air as we'd like at 5ft 11"", but he is useful with his feet and close control. He would be third choice, but could be good for us. His link up play is nice and gets people involved as well as trying to score himself.

**Andre Ayew:**

I would absolutely love Andre at the Liberty. He is a strong, agile and skillful winger, with a cracking goal scoring record for a winger, 188 games with 58 goals to his name. This would be positive for us as a lot of our wingers don't really score, we had Dyers little flirty start scoring 4 goals I think. His ability in the air for a winger is awesome and his passing and defensive capabilities are top notch. He could well fill in at left back if needed. His finishing is good, as represented by his goal scoring record and with lots of experience in big competitions he would, or should, be able to handle pressure well. Not to mention he has competed in 2 world cups, I think, for his country, scoring a couple of goals for Ghana in the 2014 world cup. He is one of my ideal transfers, but with bigger clubs calling, with more European tournaments and wages, I can't see him joining us. I will eat my hat if he does, but It's unlikely. But doesn't mean I can't dream! 

**Our man Nelson:**

On Saturdays performance we'd take him at a heartbeat, but could he do that regularly. I doubt if we did choose the option to buy him permanently he would be our first choice striker, but you never know he could score a hat trick against Stoke on Saturday! From what I've seen of him for us, he isn't the kind of striker that holds up play with core strength, but holds up play in his own way with cheeky tricks and flicks, bringing others into the game. He is rather quick, surprisingly so, and seems to be able to use his head. He is quite tall and not necessarily weak, so he has strength about him. Against bigger teams I can't imagine Oliviera being able to make much of a difference because the defence will be able to deal with him easily, but for the smaller teams he's a useful little player, whom I quite like. If we got him for 4-6 Million I'd be happy with that.

**Ashley Westwood:**

Tidy player, doesn't really set the world alight but gets his job done, a lot like Cork. And that is the exact reason why we don't need him. Our midfield is already jam packed with talent, not to mention the young talent coming through, Matty, Jay, King and others. We don't need a midfielder, our midfield is strong, one of the strongest in the league to be fair. Each player knows their job and I love our midfield. So no to this one. I'm not disrespecting Ashley, we just don't need him.

**Henry Saivet:**

This is another player I'd like at the club. He has lots of pace and will always play directly, wanting to beat his man. He has an eye for goal, but would suit wing player well. His pace and physicality could cause problems for some full-backs in the premier league and if his crossing is good, he could get some nice assists for us. I think, personally we need a winger and either of the ones mentioned, Maciej Rybus, or Henri would be ideal. Not to mention, as this article states we could get Saivet for 4 to 6 Million. Seems like a good buy. The one problem it could lead to is one of our wingers leaving the club, which would be sad as it would probably be Dyer who has been with us a long time.

**Jeffrey Schlupp:**

This man is extremely quick. He can play left-back or left wing, I think from watching Leicester, he more suits a winger, but he is useful at left-back with his pace and strength. I doubt he'll leave but if Leicester go down, it could be a possibility. We could get him for 4ish million and I like him, and would love us to get him.

**The End:**

I think he does believe in equality and in a way SF can stand on it semi-legitimately following on from using it as a political tool in the Troubles. But I think he's also looking at the bigger picture and seeing if he can make the DUP seem crazy even to their own base.

Although there are die hards, most people just want a normal life, and the DUP are out of step with modern times. SF have evolved the party with the times, which doesn't stop them having a bigger goal in mind.

Yes, I know, but you were the one saying Doll got them into the CL. I have no idea why you brought him up anyway, it's not like it's much of a success story for Dortmund finishing 9th and 13th. And Dortmund sold the players they could still get some good money, but there wasn't really that much of a youth thing going on. They still played with the likes of Kovac, Wörns (!), Dede. What players do you have in mind here? The loan deal for Hummels half-way through the season? Kuba? I don't really see that much of a youth movement, to me it even seemed more like getting older guys at the end of their careers like Kovac and Klimowicz than some big youth philosophy 

&gt;Klopp came into a club that were back on a sound financial footing and had a team playing in the largest stadium in the country where they were still getting huge crowds, despite being a bit shit. 

Yes, sound financial footing is different from still having the second biggest budget in the league though, which I understood you claimed Dortmund would have had at that time. 

I agree with you that it's easier in Germany to get to the top because behind Bayern there is much more parity than in England. It's easier to have success if you have a great season, because there isn't an established top 4 or so. And theoretically it's easier build something if you have success, especially with the advantages of being a big club like Dortmund, although for whatever reason no clubs in Germany (other than Bayern of course) seems to have been able to do that after their success 

What I don't agree with and the reason I replied to you in the first place is that it seems you said they were still the club with the second highest budget when Klopp took over. That hey now do is out of the question, but I understood your comment that Dortmund had that much of a budget all the way through the 2000's, and that Klopp had a budget advantage compared to his competitors other than Bayern",null,0,null,1430165347,null,0,false,0,cqqlxdx,null,t3_33f2m8,null,t1_cqqlxdx,null,t1_cqqj5bx,null,null,null,1432636984,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

However, there's no guarantee people would vote that way, and even if the did it's still winner takes all in each seat so it's likely with 54% of the vote the SNP would still take almost every seat in Scotland.

A Proportional Representation system would benefit Labour in Scotland more at the moment, FPTP is helping the SNP at the moment, they've broken through and are no longer a minor party in Scotland but the major party and so are over-represented, the other parties are now playing the part of minor parties and on track to win far fewer seats than their share of the vote suggests.

I'd love it if this election lead to electoral reform, the ratio of seats won to votes won is going to be very different for different parties, I think it completely discredits FPTP. But I'm still not optimistic either major party will want to change it as it still benefits them elsewhere. Instead I think they'll continue there steady decline of the main parties until other small parties start break through elsewhere and really force the issue. That's if the union stays together at all. FPTP rewards parties that focus tightly on certain geographical areas and punishes those that have broad appeal across the whole country, so I think that's going to lead to more divisions, Scotland vs England, England vs Wales, North vs South, Cities vs Rural, who knows but it's possible other parties will follow in the SNPs lead to success under this system.",null,0,null,1430166085,null,0,false,0,cqqmf4a,null,t3_341z4y,null,t1_cqqmf4a,null,t1_cqql2ns,null,null,null,1432637217,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

null,false,aenor,null,null,null,"&gt;Are Labour not supposed to be a left of centre, socialist party?

Lab have always been social democratic rather than socialist. 

Since 1900, when have we ever had a budget surplus? During Attlee's govt (from 1948 to 1951), Thatcher (1987) and Blair (2001 and 2002).

Notice any pattern there? Attlee costed everything - he raised NI to pay for his welfare state. He raised prescription charges to pay for sending troops to Greece. And he insisted on maintaining rationing to control how much people spent.

It was the Churchill govt of 1952 that lifted rationining and thought f**k it, even if this results in a trade deficit, I'm going to live with  it.

The SNP isn't really socialist nor social democrat. They cut 5000 teachers to pay for their free university tuition fees. As a result a child from a poor family in Tory-run England is more likely to get to university (because the education budget in England is firmly focused on schools and exam results) than a poor child from Scotland. The reason? The Scottish schools are so starved for funds that their students don't get the grades that allow them to enter university, whereas in England they do.

Which is better? To have your life ruined in Scotland at age 16 through not passing your highers (the equivalent of 5 GCSE's) or to be in England, pass your exams and go to university even though you'll get charged tuition fees. The English child is better off of course. in 2015, there is no job available to a school leaver who has no quals that can't be done better by a robot. 

So the Scots arn't benefiting from the pretendy socialism of the SNP. The SNP are loving it though - the more lives they can ruin, the more desperate people will feel. Then they can just trick them and tell them it's all the fault of ""London"" despite education being a devolved issue, and they'll vote for independence. Then after independence cut their benefits with a shrug (no subsidies from England see), and ruin lives twice over.",null,0,null,1430166236,null,0,1430166548,0,cqqmitl,null,t3_340kgy,null,t1_cqqmitl,null,t1_cqq7j7b,null,null,null,1432637265,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"Well if you could actually read your own provided data you would have realise you are just lying, from that data from the post recession point, i.e. the first point of growth, 2010, the relevant point to take, not 2011, we can see that from then till 2015 the UK economy has grown by 9.00%, Germany, 11.11%, the German economy has grown more post recession, all while the reduction in economic output was within the post recession period was within 0.1% of each other.

Now if we move away from over arching economic growth and look at a measure that effect real world people, a figure called unemployment, [as shown here](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=country:uk:de&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en), we can see that Germany's unemployment rate has dropped consistently since 2005, if we take a less sensationalist start point, i.e. 2010 the end of the recession, as shown by your supplied data, we see that at this point the UK unemployment rate was 7.7%, Germany's 7.4%. very similar, the difference, Germany's Unemployment rate drops from 7.4% a relatively high level down to 5.4% by Jun 2012, all while the UK's stagnated at around 7.7%, peaking at 8.4%, well into Sept 2013 a whole year later, Germany's is still dropping now at 4.8%, where as the UK while recovering later than Germany's is still at 5.5%.

The new government came in in 2010, the unemployment rate has stagnated all through their government, how anyone can argue that they helped it is just silly, if economic growth isn't employing people it isn't helping the country as a whole it is just leading to further inequality, how unsurprising that economic growth is occurring making rich people richer under a conservative government all while there are no more jobs to go round, trickle down economic BS at its finest. 

Edit: to add to this lets take a look at something reddit will care about [the under 25 unemployment rate](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=country:uk:de&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=age_group:y_lt25&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:uk:de&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=412473600000&amp;tend=1388102400000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false), I think that graph sums up why this government sucks vs Germany.

null,false,Milemarker80,null,null,null,"London based NHS type here. We're a lot luckier than many areas of the country, as we not only generally have at least 3-5 GP practices covering every postcode, but also some choice as to acute or mental health trust.

If you have any doubts as to your GPs initial diagnosis, it's really very easy to get a second opinion at the same practice. Just phone and ask - no GP will take offence and it's in your best interests. It may also be worth looking at the NHS choices website, seeing if there's any well reviewed and rated other practices covering your address to look at trying as well. Most GPs will have practice websites, where each GP will have a short biography and perhaps detail their clinical interest. If you can find one with an interest in mental health, I'd give that a go.

Once you secure a referral to a mental health professional, again, you have choice in London. It's likely the first appointment will be a high level diagnosis / series of questions, where they work out where to send you onto, specialism wise. If at any point you feel that you're not being considered properly, get back in touch with your GP to discuss a referral to an alternative mental health trust.

I work with East London Foundation Trust and the Tavistock and Portman Trust, both of which are great, and I'd definitely recommend them. They're both in North / East London though, so potentially not accessible / ideal if you're south west etc.  Good luck!",null,0,null,1430167139,null,0,false,0,cqqn4jd,null,t3_340xkj,null,t1_cqqn4jd,null,t1_cqq8tov,null,null,null,1432637549,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

It would appear to show that longer term we are in a better position. Higher growth now, higher rate of unemployment dropping, I mean we dropped 1.5% 2013-14 vs Germany's 0.2%, hardly something to baulk at.

The first step was I saw my GP (after dealing with it undiagnosed for a few years) and received an initial diagnosis of clinical depression and placed on anti-depression medication and referred to the mental health department at the local hospital. I saw a couple of doctors and various councillors there, but a severe negative reaction to the anti-depressants got me seen by one of their senior doctors who I ended up having a 3 hour session with going over basically my entire life. 

She then placed me with an initial diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder and Aspergers Syndrome. She then placed me to see another doctor to follow up on the BP and consider options for medication. I could have followed up on the AS if I wanted to and gotten it formalised, but being an adult there was nothing really to be done, it just helps explain a few things. 

From then on I kept seeing the same doctor for a few months who narrowed down the disorder to type 2 as we could clearly identify hypomanic episodes and extreme/suicidal depression episodes but no manic ones, which is required for type 1 BP. This is actually not really a good thing, I would have preferred manic episodes and less depressive ones tbh... :P 

Then I moved house and had to change hospital trusts. During this time I was trying 2 medications, lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant and Quetiapine, an antipsychotic. These didn't go well, quetiapine made me get extremely dizzy and on a couple of occasions pass out (including once in the middle of the British Museum......) and lamotrgine screwed with my sleep. I ended up dropping both and left the medication until I finished moving hospital trusts. 

In my new hospital, I saw a new doctor who wanted to try some new medication. I was.. disinclined, but he suggested a few and said I could choose and to look them up. I ended up going for lithium, which has actually worked out well, but it took 3 months of trialing before it settled on a dose, though I still need regular blood tests. I also see a case worker at the hospital once a month to ensure I am stable and things are going well, as well as the doctor every 4 months. Overall the entire process from diagnosis to (so far) stable on medication took 2 years.

A child from a poor English family is more liklely to get to university than a child from a poor Scottish family - due to the English child achieving the entrance exam requirements and the Scottish child not. And getting your exam results is a bigger determinant for attending university than free tuition fees (which means sweet FA  if you don't qualify to enter in the first place).

See the following article:

http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/11/educational-apartheid-is-scotlands-greatest-national-disgrace/

&gt;Level 5 in Scotland is the approximate equivalent of passing GCSEs at grades A-C. And here we discover that only 14 percent of children at Castlemilk High achieved five passes at Level 5. ... In Glasgow as a whole a mere 27 percent of pupils reach Level 5 in at least five subjects. Across the whole of Scotland a mere 38 percent of children do so.

&gt;...King Solomon Academy in London – where 50% of children qualify for free school meals, a measure of deprivation broadly comparable to that found at Govan and Castlemilk in Glasgow – but **93 percent of kids in its first GCSE class passed five GCSEs, including Maths and English, at grades A-C**. There’s Mossbourne Academy too, where 80 percent of pupils, many of whom don’t speak English at home, achieved at least five good GCSE s and from which pupils regularly graduate to attend Cambridge, Oxford and other Russell Group universities.

&gt;And there’s Perry Beeches in Birmingham where, in 2007 just 21% of children got five good GCSEs but where in 2011 74 percent did and, this year, **100 percent passed at least five GCSEs and 77 percent did so including Maths and English**. Forty percent of Perry Beeches children qualify for free school meals. Its intake is, broadly speaking, as poor as the intake at Govan High. Its results are from a different planet.

Those Scottish kids have had their lives ruined. Their teaching has been cut to fund free tuition fees for public school kids, just like in the 1950's - but unlike the '50's, in 2015 the only job someone can do leaving school at 16 with low quals is cleaning toilets - everything else can be done by a robot.

The English kids on the other hand are all in contention for going to Uni, because that's where the budget is focused  - on schools and grades. Yeah, they'll pay £9000 p.a. plus interest for universty, but at least they'll get there.

But, as a parent(!), I am very realistic about my child's abilities. I don't consider her a special little bunny. (Well, of course I *do*, but not in the way that you meant.) Most of her teachers are excellent, and I would certainly place a great deal of value on their opinion. But teachers are not infallible, and some of them are downright awful. I have encountered some who clearly don't even know the names of their pupils, let alone their ideal level in GCSE papers.

As well as this, teachers and parents have different priorities. While ojectives of teachers and parents overlap, they are not exactly the same. Teachers can perhaps be prone to playing safe to protect school league table positions. Parents may be more willing to take a risk so that their children can excel, especially as a child can always retake the next year in case of failure. Schools cannot.

TLDR: it's perhaps not as simple as you make out.

The other most common reason is if they think you have too much credit available. If you are dirt poor on 15k a year (like most people in the UK) even a £500 credit limit represents £500 of available debt that someone living hand to mouth won't be able to afford to pay back promptly.

That being said, i don't want to denigrate it, because it has great views of skiddaw, blencathra to the north and many more to the south.

A lot of the numbers are padded by record numbers of people going self employed to run businesses that aren't worth a teaspoon of spunk. Then of course there are good ol' zero hour contracts.

Yes, there are jobs being created - but the number of *good* jobs that will drive consumer spending and usher in long term growth of the skilled working class and middle class aren't being created at the rate the stats would like us to believe.

Even juniour positions in skilled trades now ask for 3-5 years prior experience in industry. Desireable graduate jobs are as rare as hen's teeth compared to the sheer number of even skilled graduates. Businesses simply don't have the cash to invest in juniour employees.

The old man works hard builds his business empire. The son (or daughter) saw all that grit and hard work and was involved in it themselves and run it like the old man. The grandchild born with a gold spoon in their mouths.

&gt;The __Salisbury cathedral clock__ is a large iron-framed [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock) without a dial located in the aisle of [Salisbury Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Cathedral). Supposedly dating from about 1386, it is claimed to be the oldest working clock in the world,  although a similar claim is made of the clock in the [cathedral of Beauvais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauvais_Cathedral) in France (said to date from 1305).  and the clock tower of [Chioggia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chioggia) in [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy).   The clock is one of the group of 14th to 16th century clocks to be found in the West of England. (See also [Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Cathedral_clock), [Exeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter_Cathedral#Clock), [Castle Combe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Combe_Clock), [Ottery St Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottery_St_Mary#The_church), and [Wimborne Minster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimborne_Minster_(church\)).) An attempt to date this clock to around 1386 was made by T.R. Robinson which has been supported by others. Most of the parts of the striking train are believed to be original. The great wheel of the going train is also believed to be original.

Well clearly.

It shows absolute stagnation, between the recession and now, the government has achieved nothing to help under 25 unemployment. Now of course you say, but actually between Jun 2013 and now it has drop. Correct right? But that is nothing to do with what the government has done, how do I know this? Well lets add in some classic ""we got screwed by the recession"" countries, also known as, Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal. [Here is the graph](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=country:uk:de&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;fdim_y=age_group:y_lt25&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country:uk:de:ie:pt:es:el&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=956790000000&amp;tend=1424995200000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false).

Now what do we see in this graph, that right we see between Jun 2013 and present they have all had reductions in the level of youth unemployment, yet they don't have the same government? How could that be so, because the decrease is independent of any government action, it is due to a recovery of the world economy, and the relevant recession proof of the economies, which of course Spain and Greece had very little of are also irrelevant, because that relatively level was put in place by the former labour government not the post 2010 one, and to be perfectly honest banking has made this country stronger, even if it did mean it was more effected by the financial crash. But the government has done nothing to help the situation of youth unemployment, it has lead to stagnation and they are completely apathetic, if they tried we might look more like Germany, where the reduction is steady as we go all the way down. 

But at the same time you might ask well they can't be the worst out there, and you are right, in terms of a recovery, Italy is far worse with essentially 0 recovery, but I would rather not rate us against the worst, I would rather say we should be doing better than what the random tides of the international economy suggests and facts of it are, we aren't, the government haven't effected anything.",null,0,null,1430173980,null,0,false,0,cqqrhmc,null,t3_341nk8,null,t1_cqqrhmc,null,t1_cqqqixs,null,null,null,1432639605,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

**False Statements**
&gt; At no point did Lutfur’s election material accuse Biggs of racism

which is categorically untrue, given that the press release (on page 132) which was put out by Mr Choudhury clearly did accuse him of being racist:

&gt;FORMER LABOUR LEADER ACCUSED JOHN BIGGS OF RACISM
LEAKED INTERNAL MEMO REVEALS BIGGS’ QUESTIONABLE 20 YEARS
RECORD ON RACE
Labour Mayoral hopeful John Biggs was facing mounting criticism today on his
questionable record on race issues as a leaked internal memo from the Labour Party
revealed that concerns had been raised regarding Mr Biggs’s apparent prejudice as
early as 1995.
Professor Michael Keith, now Director of the Centre for Migration Policy and Society
at Oxford University and a former Labour council leader in the borough, wrote to
Labour Councillors and MPs saying:
“In short, I would accuse John Biggs of racism” after Biggs was apparently involved in
the production of an inflammatory election leaflet.
This is not the first time Biggs has been mired in a face row. In 1998 he campaigned
against the creation of Banglatown to be added to Spitalfields Ward and in 2013 his
Labour Group made false claims that housing allocations were being targeted to Mayor
Lutfur Rahman’s supporters – claims that were gleefully used as propaganda by the
EDL.
Recently, Biggs caused controversy with irresponsible remarks on the Sunday Politics
show claiming Mayor Rahman was only serving the Bangladeshi community, at a time
when the EDL were planning to march through Tower Hamlets.
Cllr. Alibor Choudhury of Tower Hamlets First, who reported Biggs to the Equalities
and Human Rights Commission for the remarks said:
133
“John Biggs’ 20 year record of dubious racially-charged remarks is there for anyone to
see. This latest revelation shows that he doesn’t have the cultural sensitivity to run a
diverse borough like Tower Hamlets.”

The judge agreed, saying:
&gt; Mr Penny attempted unavailingly to convince me that all this press release meant was that
Mr Biggs occasionally said and did things that were considered ‘racially insensitive’. It
did not mean that. The reader of that release would get the message loud and clear: ‘John
Biggs is a racist – and his own party think so too.’

Additionally, the person who gave it to Mr Choudhury said himself:
&gt; THE COMMISSIONER: Mr. Beckett, why did you disinter this document
and give it to Mr. Alibor Choudhury?
A. At the time, your Lordship, I was very concerned about the remarks that Mr.
Biggs made on the Sunday Politics Show.
Q. That was in the September of the year before; yes?
A. That is right. I can remember speaking to Alibor Choudhury and asking
whether or not we had received an apology or an explanation for Mr. Biggs'
remarks, which I understand we hadn't. It prompted me to look back in my files at
the time when I shared Labour group membership with Mr. Biggs. In looking
through my files it helped prompt my memory and, of course, this document is very
helpful for the court today.
Q. In what way?
A. It indicates that John Biggs has a history of racially insensitive language.
Q. So the purpose of giving the document to Mr. Alibor Choudhury would be, as it
were, to support an argument that Mr. Biggs was a racist?
A. Yes. Fundamentally, yes, that is what it does.

Additionally, considering the memorandum they're talking about, it's still misleading anyway because
&gt; Secondly, the quotation ‘I would accuse John Biggs of racism’ was not only taken
completely out of context (the remainder of the sentence having been deliberately 
excised) but was factually untrue because Mr Keith was not, at that point, referring to the
allegedly ‘inflammatory’ leaflet.

**Bribery**: 
&gt;By way of another example, grants totalling just under £100,000 were handed out to ten
organisations, all Bangladeshi or other Muslim organisations, for lunch clubs when none
of them had even applied for a grant

Markovic is truly puzzling. He probably should have been loaned out but we would have slaughtered BR and the board for spending 20m on a player only to loan him. He's got bags of talent and I think he'll come good, but it's frustrating that he's not showing it. 

Lacazette, you're right and I think last summer would have been the time to go for him. He'll be so expensive after the season he's had.

Firstly, you will find it hard - everyone does. But challenging yourself and learning interesting stuff that school maths lessons never even mention is what makes UNIQ so great. Like the other commenters have mentioned, make good use of your student mentor - they'll always be around while you're in the academic sessions. Having just studied what you'll be learning they'll know what they found difficult when they learnt it themselves, which often helps. Most importantly ask all the questions you can (trust me - there is no such thing as a stupid question) and work on problems with your peers (maths is a collaborative subject and trying to explain stuff to other people can really help you understand it yourself).

They wouldn't have chosen you if they didn't think you were capable of handling the work - it's a competitive programme so you've already done well by getting a place. And UNIQ isn't just about the academic stuff so use it as a chance to meet as many people as possible and do as many of the activities as you can. You should get to the end of the week with only just about enough energy left to make the trip home. :)

When we have Lucas or another DM playing then the player next to Henderson should be able to contribute in attacks or in the transitions to attacks more than Allen can.

When the DM is injured like Lucas this season then Allen is not nearly good enough at defending or strong enough physically to take his place which means Henderson is pinned down to assist him in defending infront of our defenders..

So in my opinion it's only as backup for Henderson he should be used.. He CAN play good together with Henderson IF we get a world class front three like Suarez - Sturridge - Sterling last season since they could create stuff without much help from midfield

And with regards to United problem being nobody looked to play killer balls.. that's EXACTLY what our problem has been whenever Allen has played this season.

* During my manic episodes I work as a call girl. The hypersexuality, the huge amounts of money, the power I feel are all things that I thrive on like nothing I've ever experienced before. Nothing compares to it. Is this (the call girl part) something I should mention to the psychiatrist? It's really awkward to speak about. When I told my GP about the sex, I just said that I have a lot of it during the episodes. I didn't mention that I've worked as a call girl. 

* I'm ***terrified*** that the psychiatrist won't believe me or they'll think I'm exaggerating or *something*. This is probably just an irrational fear which comes from years of being my family's overemotional drama queen (which I realise could be a result of my mental health) and I've kind of gotten used to having my emotions dismissed by them. I really can't have the psychiatrist do the same because I know there's something wrong with me. I think what I'm trying to ask here is GPs don't just refer *anyone* do they? My GP seemed as adamant as a GP could be (so not too adamant because obviously they can't diagnose, but adamant enough to call up another GP to ask exactly what kind of professional to refer me to) when telling me that it could be bipolar.

When they have a holding mid, and are allowed to push up the field and press, they are great. Allen and Henderson made Toure and Fernando look like mugs at Anfield just by pressing and harrying them into mistakes.

This is how they should be used. If anything, we need more backup for Lucas so we can play to their strengths even if Lucas does get injured.

Against teams that park the bus or setup defensively I think we need a more direct player, but I'm happy every time I see Allen starting a big game.

I think our attacking statistics suffer a lot more due to how poor our attacking options have been this season too though. Allen's strengths have never been to lace out key passes or goals, but to strengthen our midfield and the tempo of our play. 

So when that's coupled with a lackluster front line, it creates our extremely poor attacking displays we've put on at points this year. 

The more key areas we need to strengthen is holding mid for when Lucas is injured, and an experienced goal scorer. If we get those 2 things, we'll get a lot more out of both Allen and Henderson.

In terms of the electorate, generally speaking whoever claims the middle-ground will win the election/get the most seats. New Labour is the obvious example, winning over the middle class and even a lot of the right wing media. Last election the Tories dropped a lot of the ""nasty party"" image and pushed on issues such as protecting the NHS. They didn't get a majority partly because of how the Tory vote is dispersed.

This election is weird because no party has really been going for the middle ground, Labour will probably do slightly better though due to how the system works.

LOLOLOL.

Do you know why Thickie Nicky has been backpedaling on Full Fiscal Autonomy? Because Scotland spends £7.6bn more than it raises through tax - and the shortfall is made up by subsidy from the long-suffering successful English.

If Scots were genuinely **honest** about paying their own way they'd take up FFA right now and then implement fierce austerity that would make Osborne faint. They'd say, stuff subsides from the English, we're going to pay our way even if the Bludgers from Glasgow have to drink from the ditches. 

They won't because they're a bunch of bludgers who like to pretend they are independent while pickpocketing from the rest of us. I know you'll downvote this - but that's because you are desperate to supress the truth that Scots have *never* been able to pay their bills without the English.

Prior to the Union Scotland was a Failed State. The Scottish pound was falling a stone. The Act of Union tried to stabalise things by fixing the exchange rate to 12 Pounds Scot to 1 Pound Sterling. But nobody used the Pound Scots because it was no good for any use but toilet paper.

Henderson has a much more creative role, but is the least defensive, whereas Lucas is the most defensive and doesn't contribute much offensively. Now the truth of Joe Allen is he sits between the two of them. He has more defensive duties than Hendo, and more room to roam forward than Lucas.

Allen is replaceable and rotatable, but I think he has a place here and does well for us. I can see why people are under-whelmed by him as his job isn't clear to see for all.

Economy: 5/10. His government critically failed to address Britain's productivity problem and also enacted for 1.5 years a failed contractionary policy that had to be scrapped; British GDP growth is at the moment entirely due to population growth, something that is only sustainable so long as immigration is strong.

Social policy: 3/10. The Conservative's reforms on benefits have created a nightmarish system that largely fails to get people out of un- and under-employment and needlessly targets the most vulnerable in society. The housing situation has continued to deteriorate across the country.

Civil rights: 5/10. While the passage of marriage equality was certainly a positive, the Government's track record on surveillance, its abuse of anti-terrorism legislation and other similar illiberal practices prevent me for giving passing it passing marks.

Foreign policy: 5/10. Cameron hasn't been very proactive in foreign policy, but his few initiatives have at best not caused harm to Britain, while hardly ever providing any tangible benefit.

All in all, I find his premiership disappointing, and markedly negative in regards to social policy. The ""success"" that the Government has enjoyed with the economy is due far more to Britain's position as a core EU economy which however still retains its own currency and was thus largely unaffected by the euro crisis; a position that has resulted in Britain being perceived as a comparably more attractive destination by both investors and immigrants, but a position that isn't in any way a merit of Cameron's government.

null,false,bloop24,lfc99,,null,I can and will say that.  Of course he did better at Southampton.  Teams are less likely to sit 10 men behind the ball against them which gave him more room.  Anyone that expected him to get more than like 5 goals this season was delusional and he's gotten 3.  He has probably played less than anyone would have expected with Sturridge out since Balotelli got such a long run of games while playing very poorly.  The issue with Origi or Ings(I do think overall they are better players) is that neither of them offer a different type of option which Lambert does.  Both Origi and Ings offer something similar to what Sturridge does except they aren't quite as good at it.  Lambert is a different type of striker and that's what we bought him for.  I will maintain indefinitely that the only reason people have been so hard on Lambert is because Sturridge has been injured and Balotelli has been shit.  When your 3rd and 4th choice strikers are expected to come in and perform better than your 2nd choice one all you are asking for is disappointment.  Not to mention as a whole our team has struggled to score.  That cannot be put at only our strikers feet.  We have lacked any penetration into the box.  Teams have been able to put 9 or 10 men behind the ball against us and it 100% stops us from scoring 9 times out of 10.,null,0,null,1430182717,null,0,false,0,cqqx0us,null,t3_342wup,null,t1_cqqx0us,null,t1_cqqvsan,null,null,null,1432642284,null,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8,null

null,false,the_magisteriate,tardis,TARDIS,null,"There are a few places which are natural pick up spots for Doctor Who. I wouldn't recommend you start on Classic episodes simply because the standard of television was so different back then. The budgets were low and the special effects, while pioneering at the time, look a bit naff nowadays. It was also a lot slower paced meaning a modern viewer gets bored unless they're used to the more relaxed tempo.

From then on there are three points to start watching from as I see it.

1. Series 1 - 2005. This was the start of the revived series and reintroduces every key concept and has a new Doctor and companion. However, it looks slightly dated and several of the episodes are quite rubbish. You'd also have 10 years of the show to catch up on.

2. Series 5 - 2010. This was a clean break with a new lead producer, Doctor and companion. It was designed to relaunch the show, particularly for new overseas viewers. The special effects are a lot more modern looking but starting here would get you started on a story arc that doesn't get fully resolved for over three years (and arguably still hasn't).

3. Either Asylum of the Daleks or The Snowmen - 2012. This is what I'd recommend for somebody trying to get some context for the show as it is today. It's when the current companion and a few other things are introduced. Unfortunately the 50 year special episodes in 2013 are in the middle of it, and they really need some context to appreciate.

He didn't need to be a champions league player, though. We were miles away from being a champions league team when we bought him and the club was very rocky. He was bought as a kid with potential, a good track record, and a guy that already knows our style of play. 

So, either he'd get better and grow with the squad, or he'd become a stepping stone for Rodgers until he settled and we moved on to the next level and were able to attract better.

He's come here, been absolutely awful, to the point where we'll probably sell him for scraps just to get rid of him.

Also, Balo in no shape or form automatically earns a chance to play. He's been wank when he has played, and clearly he's done shit all in training, because Brendan isn't willing to give him many more chances. He's been here a year and he still can't figure out how to fucking press in our system - which as a Striker is fairly easy. 

I'm sorry, but Balo either has one of the worst work rates in England or is one of the dumbest players in England. Every time someone praises his work rate it smacks me of them failing to understand movement in football. Balo will sprint 30 yards to needlessly pressure a full back whose just trying to slow the game down, but then lays off a midfielder looking to start a move - its absolutely idiotic. He's yet to show any willingness to run the channels, get on the shoulder, or make a front post run for once! Instead, he drifts wide to slow down possession before taking too long, or having an incredibly frustrating shot which inevitably ends 40 yards above the goal. He's frequently in the pockets, but not because he's on the CB and dropping off, but because he's fucking waddling around all game, which means that he's not creating any space by dropping and he just gets picked up by the opposition midfielder tracking back!

Has Balo played better than Sturridge lately? Debatable, especially considering Balo's best performance over the last couple of weeks can be described as decent at best. It doesn't matter though. Sturridge has endeared himself, showed his quality, and more importantly, his desire to work hard in our system. Has Sturridge been frustrating lately? Yes. Are his injuries frustrating? Yes. But the difference is that Sturridge has earned the benefit of the doubt and patience with his accomplishments at the club, Balotelli has earned nothing except a poor reputation.

Lastly, look at our midfielders reactions when Balo's on the pitch. I have never seen Henderson yell at someone as much as him, and just judging from his body language, you can tell the squad's getting frustrated with his antics. Henderson's constantly throwing his arms up, pointing at where Balotelli should've been, and its gotten to the point where our midfielders are seemingly hesitant at times to even make a forward run because they don't believe Balotelli's going to make the right pass. Add on to that his unbearable social media antics - where he's essentially proven he's an immature child - and his previous history, and theres little excuse that can be made for him. He's been one of my least favourite players at the club in recent times, and I'll be glad to see him go.",null,0,null,1430190117,null,0,false,0,cqr1sp4,null,t3_342wup,null,t1_cqr1sp4,null,t1_cqqtnjr,null,null,null,1432644602,null,44,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,44,null

If you create a plain text file containing comma-separated values (e.g. `20150427,3,4,5`) and save that with the `.csv` extension, then you can open it in Excel and the columns will appear as delimited by the commas. I assume Google Sheets is the same.

Therefore you could write a short computer program in perl (or python, or bash) to download the page source from the BlackRock site, find in it the value you seek (it's in a table row element like `&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""line heading""&gt;NAV&lt;span class=""heading""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;27/04/2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""line""&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""line text""&gt;GBX 160.60&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;`) and have it output the information you desire with commas written between the values. 

You could tell your computer to run this program periodically (this is called a ""cron job"" on *nix systems) and have it append the output from your program (the `&gt;&gt;` means ""redirect what's written to standard output, append it to the file named"") to a `.csv` file in your Google Drive folder. Google Drive would take care of synchronising the changes.

This solution is probably unworkable or incomplete - it was just what occurred to me on the spur of the moment, and there's at least one step (integrating the csv file with your existing sheet) that I'm not sure how to address.

I'm an independent consultant for Rodan + Fields (a premium skin care company created by the same dermatologists who created Proactiv). We just launched the first alternative to injectables this past January. It's called Acute Care. This is a revolutionary product. It sold out within the first 18 minutes of it going on sale. The Acute Care strips are dermal patches worn at night while you sleep. You use the strips every three nights over a 30 day period (3-4 times per year). The strips contain liquid cone technology with a patented ingredient formula consisting of Hyaluronic acid (occurs naturally in our bodies but decreases as we age) and peptides that melt down into the skin for long term residual benefits. Up until now, only way to fill wrinkles was to use injectables  to freeze the muscles or place acid under the skin. I would be happy to talk with you about Acute Care and our Redefine regimen, when used with Acute Care produced results up to 58% quicker (and longer lasting). Feel free to email me at cori.strong120@gmail.com and I'd love to chat with you!

They have the league's best story in Harry Kane, they're almost always going to be top half of the table, and they may very well be on the cusp of greatness if guys like Bentaleb and Dier take the next step or if Lamela gets better. Spurs are an extremely likable team. ",null,0,null,1430203170,null,0,false,0,cqr7inr,null,t3_3424wb,null,t1_cqr7inr,null,t1_cqqygdy,null,null,null,1432647298,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"Has he ever explained why he feels this way - ie how he is interpreting the contract in this way?

Your post is clear (thanks for that - posts here rarely confirm enough info) - the section you quoted says 1 month's notice. You have done that. But just to check as the below is based on this - the last and only fixed extension letter was to 31 May 2014 and since then you have been ""rolling""?

Now, if the contract was silent the law says the notice must end on a rental period. So, if you pay rent on last day of each month (?) then 19 March -&gt; 19 April, next rental period is 30 April so that is when the tenancy ended. So arguably that is the longest your tenancy could be.

What power does the landlord have now? Stop agreeing (verbally or otherwise) to extensions, he is taking you for a ride. Equally if the tenancy has ended utilities should not be your responsibility (just make sure you tell each and every provider and the council you have left in *writing*).

Also, the landlord did take a deposit no matter how he described it. If he won't give it back speak to CAB/Shelter about a very short and easy court case (that may be simple enough to be done on paper alone) to get your ""deposit"" back and possibly compensation on top - your landlord has failed to comply with the relevant legislation.

&gt;  Ofcom did find against Bengali media organisations over partisan coverage. That is an example of bad editorial practice, but no more so than the often dishonestly partisan coverage produced by mainstream press organisations constantly, and their cosy relationships with Labour and Tory politicians.

&gt;The BBC Panorama on Lutfur released before the election is an example of gross media bias and yet, this was not of concern to the petitioners. The charge here was essentially “Lutfur hired an adviser to work with the Bengali press to promote his work as a politician.” This is called public relations. Hardly illegal, and it would be interesting to see what a police prosecution made of these charges.

Well this ignores most of the judgement on why it was bribery:
 
&gt;The chief political correspondent of Channel S was a man called Mohammed Jubair. The
dealings with Mr Jubair were murky in the extreme. Mr Rahman seems to have arranged 
for him to be employed by the Council (at taxpayers’ expense), apparently to advise on
media relations with the Bangladeshi community. It is pointed out that, while there was
an advisor in relation to the small Somali community (though not covering media
relations with that community), there was no advisor (media or otherwise) in respect of
any other of the Tower Hamlets communities and no media advisor engaged to deal with
community relations as a whole. It is difficult not to see this as a further example of Mr
Rahman’s administration being heavily skewed towards his own community rather than
the entire Borough. The payments made to Mr Jubair were subjected to the scrutiny of PwC and did not come
up to that scrutiny. They were, to a significant extent, unaccounted for and some £20,000
of expenditure was not represented by time sheets.
&gt; Mr Jubair was not called to give evidence. Beyond Mr Rahman’s evidence, there was no
evidence before the court to show that Mr Jubair had carried out any work on behalf of
the Council. The reality is that Mr Jubair’s function was to publicise Mr Rahman and his
achievements and to ensure that favourable coverage continued in the media, particularly
Channel S with which he remained closely associated",null,0,null,1430203486,null,0,false,0,cqr7m4h,null,t3_3432ho,null,t1_cqr7m4h,null,t1_cqqs0pz,null,null,null,1432647343,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Then you have studies into evolutionary biology take it even further and propose the reason homosexuality hasn't been bred out is because it decreases infant mortality rates, such as the gay uncle hypothesis or study done into black swans (in which 25% enter male-male pair bonds and steal eggs, but raise better chicks so infant mortality rate decreases, which means a net gain for the species so it keeps homosexuality around).

----------Coutinho'oh'oh'oh------------

------Balotelli-------------Sturridge----

- Fast paced tactics with medium/short passing. (72 for speed 42 for passing)

- Medium Agressive defending (Pressure 51 Aggression 55), change to 40 and 40 if opponent is managing to consistently get behind your back line. 

- Both Balotelli and Sturridge instructed to Get in Behind and Press Back Line. 

- Sterling instructed to Get Forward. Gerrard instructed to Stay Back. Hendo instructions are balanced, if losing or in need of goals then sub Lallana in for Hendo and set instructions to Get Forward. 

- Countinho is instructed to Stay Forward. If defending a lead then change to balanced or come back on defence. 

- If all else fails just get the ball to Coutinho and dribble past everyone...because he can. Right Bumper is his friend.

null,false,loocret,lfc99,,null,"Rodgers hasn't tried anything with him or the other strikers. He's almost solely relied on Coutinho and Sterling to bring life to the team, but as seen in West Brom, they aren't the dribblers they think they are. I haven't seen Rodgers stick with a striking duo consistently all season. I admit I missed a few games so I might be wrong, but I feel like he just threw Balo out there and said ""hey play with this aged legend who is in LA already and half an injured roster [Lucas, Sturridge]"" Honestly, I know he's not the greatest thing on earth, but I think Rodgers has mismanaged his formations to accommodate Gerrard. Gerrard was amazing, but that's the thing. WAS. And the way he's been playing towards the end of the season has shown he has no interest in trying anymore. I know I'm going to get destroyed for not liking 2014/2015 Gerrard, but this isn't the same man who led Liverpool to 2nd last season and the other players are suffering for it. Henderson needs time to get experience as captain and not be in Gerrards shadow. Balo is seen as selfish but in reality, and West Brom's performance shows, he wants to stay in Liverpool and he is a team player. I know he didn't run in the box as much but he kept trying to keep attacks alive by being an option to pass to until the last 10 minutes of the game where he was trying to just kick the ball against the bus. Just my 2 cents as I stay up all night studying for my engineering finals. 
  TLDR: Balo is suffering from a injured team, aging legend who's in LA, and mismanagement from Rodgers. YAY FINALS!",null,0,null,1430204940,null,0,false,0,cqr81no,null,t3_342g0d,null,t1_cqr81no,null,t1_cqr4qwa,null,null,null,1432647559,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

null,false,collinsl02,null,null,null,"I'd heartily recommend a visit into Portsmouth Historic Dockyard - this is the base of HMS *Victory*, the oldest commissioned warship in the world and Lord Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar. Plus the remains of the *Mary Rose* are there, Henry VIII's flagship which sank in 1545 whist fighting off a French invasion fleet in the Solent near Portsmouth Harbour. A large proportion of her settled in the mud and was preserved well until the 1980s when she was raised.

Also present at the dockyard is *HMS Warrior*, the world's first iron hulled warship - she was built in response to *La Gloire*, a French ship which was iron plated (in that they bolted iron plates onto an existing ship) - *Warrior* is different in that she was constructed from iron plates attached to an iron frame (she has a layer of wood between the two iron hull layers but that's bolted to the iron hull). From 1860 until 1875 she was the strongest ship afloat, and was only outclassed by another Royal Navy ship, *HMS Devastation*. However short her naval career may have been, she was a model for all future ships and was the transition point from wooden sailing ships with loads of smaller guns to an iron hulled ship powered by steam (with sail in reserve in *Warrior*'s case) with fewer larger guns.

Also present is *HMS Monitor*, which is a monitor class gunboat. She is one of only three surviving WWI ships of the RN, and the only surviving ship to have served on the Gallipoli campaign. 

Added to that, you have a range of buildings and exhibits open to the public, including the Museum of the Royal Navy.

I'm going to pick out the bits that are wrong, this might take a while though as it is almost entirely nonsense. 

&gt; Refereeing standards has reached an all time low. 

No, they haven't. 

&gt; Or is it just the relative newness of these errors that keep it fresh in our memories and we have forgotten that referees have always been unreliable from time immemorial?

Wow, this is the one bit you got right. Yes, you only remember them because they are new. Can anyone remember a refereeing ""controversy"" from 5 years ago? Could you pick one from every week 5 years ago? No, of course not. 

&gt; Secondly, the profession lacks a consistency in meting out punishment

No, it doesn't, it has a very good review system.

&gt; Talk of refereeing standards reaching epidemic levels began from the end of last season.

No, it didn't, this has been happening for years and years. 

&gt; The FA was urged to implement the goal line technology system to at least correctly ascertain if the ball had crossed the line, and relieve the utterly useless sideline referees who were earlier entrusted with this job.

The FA were not ""urged"" to do anything, FIFA started the ball rolling after the 2010 World Cup, multiple systems were tested and eventually the Premier League implemented Hawk Eye. The ""sideline referees"" (I assume you mean the goal line officials) were only ever used in European competition, not the PL.

&gt; Or is the FA and FIFA still employing referees to not hurt their ego. I mean, c’mon guys.. people become referees only after failing to make it as footballers themselves.

No, they don't. 

&gt; The context for this entire piece is Michael Oliver’s horrow show at the Emirates on Sunday.

Oliver had a very good game. The only incident that you could really claim that he got wrong was the Oscar one, and even then you see those kinds of incidents not given all the time, it was just a coming together. If that happened on the ground then there would be no penalty, Ospina was clearly going for the ball. 

&gt; The 3 stonewall penalties not given in our favour

You're a fucking idiot. 

&gt; But as the season has progressed, his earlier tenacious post-match personality has gone from that^ to “I am not going to talk about the referee if that’s what you’re asking” and “I will only refer you to minute 16, 30, 33 and 60 

Except on Sunday. When he praised Oliver for handling the game well. 

And finally...

&gt; Barkeep: “How many did you have tonight?”

&gt;Michael Oliver: “Uhh.. add 4 to my tab”?

&gt;B: “Your tab keeps getting higher. I cant float you for much longer”

&gt;MO: “I know.. I know”

What the fuck is this??

Conversely, over austerity also causes problems, but they are longer term.

Of course, no doubt the fact that the Conservatives are ideologically aligned with austerity measures helped to tilt the scales, but maybe a Labour government would have taken the same route given the choices then -- no one can know that counterfactual.

null,false,givecake,null,null,null,"Ok. The article is saying that the study compares adopters with normal family units. And because of this, you could probably test for heterosexual adopters vs heterosexual normal families, and find similar results. 80% of the homosexual parents are lesbian too, so the results don't properly represent the homosexual community. This is fairly significant again when you consider the studies that show that women are more typically invested in child-rearing. 

So these studies don't tell us that homosexual parents are better than heterosexual parents. They do suggest that in many ways, there's no real difference though in many of the cases. 

There are apparently factors not taken into consideration. Children older than 18 years of age were not included. Also, sexual orientation and other factors were not considered, though that's best left for another discussion. 

So am I thinking something which is opposite to what the studies show? No. I still think that male/female parents are better. Are there some cases where homosexual parents are a better choice? There must be a lot, yes. But the potential can never be the same. 

Here's one obvious reason why, and it doesn't take a study to see it. Children best learn by example, and they forfeit an entire example when they have parents of only one sex. If it's a male child with lesbian mothers, then he doesn't learn a manly example. If it's a female child with male fathers, she doesn't learn a womanly example. If it's a male with male fathers, he doesn't get to learn how to treat women in an intimate relationship, and must learn it from the world. The same goes for girls with female mothers. What's wrong with getting these critical educational elements from the world? Well, it's a gamble isn't it. The child may well stumble upon a good role model from which to learn from, but the chances are that they won't.

I hear the words ""one dimensional"" used to describe him a lot and thats just a /r/soccer circle jerk. He does take on his man, he does cut inside, he crosses, he goes for shots. I just don't see the hatred personally. He is crucial to our attacking play and plays a part in pretty much every attack, he's a player you don't see disappear in a game.

Based on what?

&gt;If it's a male child with lesbian mothers, then he doesn't learn a manly example. If it's a female child with male fathers, she doesn't learn a womanly example. If it's a male with male fathers, he doesn't get to learn how to treat women in an intimate relationship, and must learn it from the world. The same goes for girls with female mothers. What's wrong with getting these critical educational elements from the world? Well, it's a gamble isn't it. The child may well stumble upon a good role model from which to learn from, but the chances are that they won't. The chances are that they'll pick it up from multiple places, and it will be more of a fragmented education. 

Okay, so I take it you think single parents should not be allowed to have kids either?

Would she not get a ""womanly example"" from her grandmother, her aunties, my friends, her teachers and other females in her life? These aren't good enough for her and too ""fragmented"", she has to have a mother around at all times, even if she's a drunken waster?

The manager called me at near 10 at night to tell me the owner doesn't want me to come in anymore.

Not only did I NOT get paid my notice period I also had my wages docked from what I earnt.

Please don't reply regarding that top bit. It's for context.

I had to sign on, my first appointment I went to the first floor, at 18 I was a bit overwhelmed as to what I had to do or where I had to go, I asked someone and they said first floor, so I went there, nearly an hour after the ""interview"" had passed I asked someone if I they were running late. After a brief conversation I was told I was on the wrong floor. They took me to the right floor and I had my ""interview"". I was interrogated and they kept asking ""well your interview was over an hour ago, you're late. Why were you late?"". Numerous times it took me to tell them, I can't late. I arrived early and one of their incompetent baboons told me to go to the other floor. 

At the end of the interview she gave me a date to come back to talk with the job coach. Just as I was leaving I went ""okay, thank you. So XDate at XTime on this floor yeah?"". Oh no. She was like ""oh no, that's the other floor for that appointment"".

I left and over the next 2 weeks filled at my job search book. Went for that appointment to be told their systems were down and to come back 2 days later as she can't access my file. So that wasted nearly 2 hours I could have been job hunting for.

Then at the appointment I finally got to with the systems working, I was told I had filled the book out wrong. That's more what I'm going to do I.e ""search bus times to XDestination"".

4 weeks I was in that system. 4 weeks of handing out CV's (whilst wearing a suit may I add) and religiously applying for jobs whilst I was pressured into going to the doctors to be signed off as too ill to work. I told her ""No, it's not down to a Doctor, if I feel fit to work, I'm going to work."" 

I last got a payment around 7 weeks ago. I haven't been paid from my new job because I missed the payroll cut off date with when I started. Even so I'm only going to be getting 3 weeks pay. So my last payment was of around £150 to last me nearly 2 months of rent, food, gas, electric, water. It's absurd. I know I'm behind on rent, that's fine I can sort that. But I've had to live out of my very little savings because of that to be able to afford to eat and actually live. I've not lived a life of luxury. Thankfully my new job did an incentive of overtime with giving me £100 tesco vouchers on the day of doing overtime. So that helped.

But, it's a fucking crooked system. I also got a letter the week I started my new job telling me that because I left my job on my own free will, they were looking at sanctioning me for 6 months. I would have been very cold and very hungry had I not found a new job. So the fact that I was being paid below minimum wage, and got asked to leave early wasn't enough to warrant leaving that job. I'd like to see the people at the job center live off the £690 a month I was earning getting a pittance in housing benefit before I quit. 

On a funnier note, my brother mentioned when he was at the job center a few years ago, the person next to him was getting sanctioned and he turned around and went ""If I and everyone else was employed you wouldn't even have a fucking job!""

Based on the bit after that you replied to. 

&gt; Okay, so I take it you think single parents should not be allowed to have kids either?

Single parents don't need to change any laws, do they? So that's irrelevant. As I've said, children are still best raised by the normal family model, and that means single parents are always going to struggle. To be consistent, it must be said that there will be plenty of single parents that raise their kids better than many normal family units. The only relevant thing here is the potential. 

&gt; Would she not get a ""womanly example"" from her grandmother, her aunties, my friends, her teachers and other females in her life? These aren't good enough for her and too ""fragmented"", she has to have a mother around at all times, even if she's a drunken waster?

Yes, you get a womanly example from all those. You roll a dice and typically get bits and pieces from different sources. Fragmented, yes. Not optimal. It's about the perceived primary care-givers. If you become a parent, you will become familiar with this phrase, because it's in all the books and studies. An association made when young which holds for life, but changes as time goes on. The primary care-givers are from where the child gains the earliest examples, and the strongest ones. 

In being consistent with all I've said, drunken wasters are bad examples to children, and cannot be considered for being the best potential parents. 

&gt; And if children learn by example, why aren't all kids heterosexual like their parents?

This question is about the nature of heterosexuality, a different topic. Children are moral agents though, and have free will. You'll likely notice that homosexuals are likely to emulate their parents in their love for each other, and that would be what they learned from example. If their parents did not love each other at all, how good do you suppose their relationships will be when they get older?

So the studies aren't good enough or valid, but your personal beliefs based on nothing are? Lol

&gt;To be consistent, it must be said that there will be plenty of single parents that raise their kids better than many normal family units. The only relevant thing here is the potential. 

But you said it's ""a gamble"" when kids miss out on that vital opposite sex influence in the house hold, what's different about single parents? If you acknowledge the majority of single parents kids grow up fine even with just one parent, not even two, without an opposite sex influence as well, so even worse than gay parents, what's the problem?

&gt;You'll likely notice that homosexuals are likely to emulate their parents in their love for each other, and that would be what they learned from example. If their parents did not love each other at all, how good do you suppose their relationships will be when they get older? 

What are you talking about? I know plenty of homosexuals and heterosexuals who grew up with awful parents with a terrible relationship who fought all the time and got divorced, but they grew up fine and can have happy relationships. This would also suggest kids raised by single parents are somehow incapable of knowing how to be in a relationshup?

Despite the emphasis you put on parents, they really don't influence us passed the age of 13 or whenever. If anything we try to be as least like our parents as possible most of the time. Our worldview/opinions are primarily influenced by TV, our favourite musicians or our friends more than parents 

Besides, all of this is based on outdated sexist stereotypes. It's entirely possible that you can have a mother and a father, but instead of being 1950s cliches, the mother is actually very cold or tomboyish and the father is the sensitive one. These days it's far from a garuentee that your mother will be a frilly baking hug machine and your dad will be the classic masculine dad.

Secondly, by voting for a candidate who loses and/or a party that is underrepresented in the commons, you are helping to support the case for a system of proportional representation. The share of the vote going to the two main parties is falling, and the probability of a single party governing alone is falling.

Each Premier League match is evaluated by a former senior referee who scrutinises every decision using the match footage and ProZone to measure the officials’ technical performance.

Aye. Take a look at voting polls. In many places around the world, votes go close to 50%. You are aware of the controversy surrounding this issue, yet here you seem to imply that having a problem with the actual definition and word is a small thing which I should dismiss. Disregarding the fact that if the word was changed, it would necessarily require another, more fitting definition, and the controversy would immediately cease to exist. Do you see the easy option here? The real question here is: Why would activists create the controversy to begin with?

&gt; You haven't presented anything which would diminish the value of marriage as a union of consenting and loving adults equal to that between a man and a woman other than the half-explored argument around children. That argument falters when you get into the realm of infertility, which I think you realised. 

I agree with your sentiment here. So we could ask the question, why is the children topic brought up at all? The answer is connected to your first point. Marriage is not just about a union, but necessarily spills over into the legality of children too. If you remove children from the equation, then the only thing you need to address is the controversy which can be solved by my proposed solution. I can't imagine that anyone would be against recognizing and supporting families that have homosexual partners/parents. To be against that would be being against free will in general, I think.

For all the aggro, the 2 coalition partners balanced each other rather well. There have been mistakes, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse, and now the economy is recovering. I don't think any one party could have achieved this. The Conservatives on their own would have gone crazy, cut too deep and pandered even more to their right-wing factions, and the Liberal Democrats may not have fully gone ahead with the cuts needed that are starting to show positive effects now.

Places where the cuts were not done right (it's an act of balancing/calibration) are worth noting, and I understand all the anger over tuition fees. But the Lib Dems were a very small minority in that coalition, it was hardly 50:50 (or even close). They couldn't do a lot, but they did serve as a good softening agent on what could have been a difficult time. Conversely, a Lib Dem or Labour govenment would not have done as much for the economy, because their voters won't accept such deep cuts. This precarious balancing act has worked reasonably well all things considered. I am frightened of what comes next.

null,false,collinsl02,null,null,null,"Right, here goes a long response:

Firstly, we aren't directly electing the Prime Minister. The system is that we elect a Member of Parliament to represent our local area (called a constituency). This can be a large constituency in a rural area (Ross, Skye and Lochaber) or a small densely populated one (Islington North). Each candidate for a constituency can be a member of a political party, or they can be an independent candidate. 

In our system of first past the post voting (which a lot of people think is broken but there you go) the candidate with the most votes gets the seat in the House of Commons. The FPTP system means that a candidate with a low number of overall votes can still win - for example in the 2005 election the Labour party took 57% of the seats, with only 36% of the vote.

Once the votes have been counted and we know which MPs have which seats (and which parties the MPs belong to) we can work out which party overall has the majority of seats in the house of Commons (I'll come onto the House of Lords later). The party with the majority of seats (I.E. one party with over 50%) is asked by Her Majesty the Queen to form a Government. These days the Queen has no choice in who she asks because we have a constitutional Monarchy, but it's officially Her Government.

The leader of the party with a majority takes the Prime Minister's job - they are essentially in charge of the country, but they don't have a separate branch of government that they control like the President and the Executive Branch in the USA.

In cases (such as the last parliament and most likely this one) where an absolute majority has not been reached, parties may form coalitions in order to gain the most seats overall - the coalition of two or more parties can be used to count towards the majority. 

In cases where no coalition has been formed and no majority is present the largest minority party may still be asked to form a government however the system quickly becomes unworkable because there would be too much conflict and discussion on the legislation being tabled (in the UK tabling a motion means discussing it, unlike in the US where it means shelving it and not proceeding with it) and not enough aye votes would be passed to move legislation on in a timely manner.

When a majority government is not formed the procedure would likely be to have another general election as soon as possible, to hope that a majority government can be formed out of that one. Although she has never used this power before, the Queen could theoretically refuse to ask any minority party to form a government, triggering another general election without a government being formed, but if this happens it may cause a constitutional crisis which is a Bad Thing.

The other chamber in the Houses of Parliament is the House of Lords. The members of this chamber are men and women who have been given peerages by the Queen (on the orders of the government though) which entitle them to sit in the Lords. These people can be anything from prominent industrialists (Lord Sugar) to ex-senior politicians (Lord Prescott) etc. Because the Lords hold their seats for life (in theory, they may be removed if they are involved in a major scandal and have their peerages removed) they are supposed to be the ""long term view"" of the country. Because they are not elected they have no powers to block legislation permanently, all they can do is vote to pass a piece of legislation or return it to the House of Commons for another vote. A 2/3rds majority is then needed in the House of Commons to pass the returned legislation without the further involvement of the Lords - they therefore act as a checking system to make sure that controversial legislation has been thoroughly debated and is agreed upon by the vast majority of MPs.

The three currently largest parties in the government just gone (I'm saying this in this way because officially the last government has been dissolved by the Queen (on a schedule of every 5 years which was set by the last government rather than the government choosing when to call an election - the Queen has no say in when it gets dissolved) and we don't yet know which parties will be the largest in the next government as the election hasn't yet happened) were the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, and the Liberal Democrats.

The Conservative party and the Labour party have been the largest two parties since the 1920s when Labour overtook the Liberal (as it then was) party. The leader of the Conservative Party is David Cameron, and the leader of the Labour Party is currently Ed Milliband. Tony Blair was the leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007, and was Prime Minister from 1997 until 2007. The Liberal Democrat's leader is Nick Clegg, who served as the Deputy Prime Minister in the last government as the government was formed of a coalition of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats.

In the British system the second largest party (traditionally either the Conservatives or Labour) is referred to as the ""opposition"" and the leader of that party is the ""leader of the opposition"" - this essentially means that the opposition party forms a ""shadow cabinet"" which will draft policy and will watch as much as they can of what their counterparts in the actual cabinet are doing. The leader of the opposition also has a chance to have an ""exchange of views"" with the Prime Minister once a week at ""[Prime Minister's Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF8pM4wiLaY)"" - a weekly even where MPs can ask the PM about various issues that affect their constituency or general policy questions. These events are televised and there are loads on youtube as they can be quite fun at times, especially when you get two good leaders going head to head.

Political outlook wise, the Conservative party can be described as slightly right of (our) centre, and the Labour party can be described as slightly left of centre. Bear in mind though that our centre is well to the left of the US centre.

Views wise, right now the main focus of the major parties is the economy and it's continued recovery. Labour wish to improve the economy by making slight cuts in expenditure and by borrowing some money to work on stimulating the economy, whereas the Conservatives wish to make much deeper cuts and borrow no money at all whilst spending money to work on stimulating the economy. And as usual both sides accuse the other of messing up the economy, the Conservatives keep going on about how Labour left them a complete mess to clear up and Labour keep saying the Conservatives are cutting everything back too far. 

The other differences come in things like membership of the EU - the Conservatives have promised to have a referendum (national vote) on whether we stay in the EU or whether we leave it. Labour have said they will not have such a referendum, but both sides agree that our position in the EU needs to be renegotiated.

The other major difference is taxes - there are some differences in how the parties want to deal with the tax rate, with Labour accusing the Conservatives of giving tax breaks to their rich mates (the Conservative party is seen as more upper class whereas Labour was formed by and is still largely controlled by trade unions) whilst the Conservative view is that Labour is making the richest few pay more than their fair share.

The most major minor issue is immigration - both Labour and the Conservatives are committed to cutting the number of immigrants this country gets from outside the EU (we can't restrict intra-EU movement) but both sides are accusing the other of not meeting the targets they set when they were both in power.

I read one of those. His argument was basically that the deficit should not be cut until the recession is over, as this would cause the recession to be a bit worse. This is true, but it's a crackers justification for wasting piles of money. The sooner the state ceases wasting money the better.

Bastiat illustrated this by using the idea that troops should not be disbanded after a war, because of the economic impact:

'""Disband a hundred thousand men! Do you know what you are saying? What will become of them? Where will they get a living? Don't you know that work is scarce everywhere? That every field is over-stocked? Would you turn them out of doors to increase competition and to weigh upon the rate of wages? Just now, when it is a hard matter to live at all, it would be a pretty thing if the State must find bread for a hundred thousand individuals? Consider, besides, that the army consumes wine, arms, clothing--that it promotes the activity of manufactures in garrison towns--that it is, in short, the godsend of innumerable purveyors. Why, any one must tremble at the bare idea of doing away with this immense industrial movement.""

This discourse, it is evident, concludes by voting the maintenance of a hundred thousand soldiers, for reasons drawn from the necessity of the service, and from economical considerations. It is these considerations only that I have to refute.

A hundred thousand men, costing the tax-payers a hundred millions of money, live and bring to the purveyors as much as a hundred millions can supply. This is that which is seen.

But, a hundred millions taken from the pockets of the tax-payers, cease to maintain these tax-payers and the purveyors, as far as a hundred millions reach. This is that which is not seen.'

Putting money into the economy by taking money out of the economy and putting it back in again does not help the economy.

Personal beliefs? Like my personal beliefs that red is the colour of strawberries? Most people would see that as fact, the things that science attempts to gain information from. 

&gt; But you said it's ""a gamble"" when kids miss out on that vital opposite sex influence in the house hold, what's different about single parents? If you acknowledge the majority of single parents kids grow up fine even with just one parent, not even two, without an opposite sex influence as well, so even worse than gay parents, what's the problem?

I'm saying single parents suffer too. Potential is lost whenever a single parent rears a child. The problem is the same. 

&gt; What are you talking about? I know plenty of homosexuals and heterosexuals who grew up with awful parents with a terrible relationship who fought all the time and got divorced, but they grew up fine and can have happy relationships. This would also suggest kids raised by single parents are somehow incapable of knowing how to be in a relationship?

This is where we get into defining happy. But regardless of the definition, everything you don't get from your parents, is something you need to get from somewhere else. Like I've said, that can be a good thing, in the case of the bad parent and TV babysitter (think cable guy), but it's far from the best thing. Divorce rates show how good we are at relationships in general. 

&gt; Despite the emphasis you put on parents, they really don't influence us passed the age of 13 or whenever. If anything we try to be as least like our parents as possible most of the time. Our worldview/opinions are primarily influenced by TV, our favourite musicians or our friends more than parents 

You're absolute right about parents not influencing us as strongly past a young age. Our characters are largely set by age 7-8 apparently. Set for life. It's our parents that set these characters we have, the majority of them. That doesn't mean we will be like our parents, no, that means we will be the fitting cast of the mold our parents used to shape us.

But there are quite a large amount of handjobs holding the place back...

... better to face them down than run away from them though.

I think the critical mass is there to do it, as long as people don't just surrender to resignation and cynicism.

Take the recent Wells stuff. There's actually a positive story tucked away in there:

- first time a DUP minister has had to resign for being a small-minded arse
- even some of his DUP colleagues were prepared to say in public he was out of line
- the gay marriage vote at Stormont gets closer and closer

It may seem glacial slow at times, but things are slowly drifting in a more socially liberal direction.

And think back to where we were in the 70s on this. ""Save Ulster from Sodomy"" and homosexuality still criminalised.

If you think too about how progress was made in England and Wales (and now ROI) as opposed to say Islamic or Sub-Saharan African countries - it takes a civil society movement to make it happen, demand the change, and create an environment where politicians shift from crowd pleasing homophobia to crowd pleasing social liberalism. 

In other words, sometimes social liberals in NI need to accept some blame themselves - for not being as active and effective as their counterparts elsewhere in shifting social attitudes (English legislation and its political class used to be pretty homophobic once upon a time too).",null,0,null,1430211467,null,0,1430211990,0,cqr9ngn,null,t3_344oma,null,t1_cqr9ngn,null,t1_cqr94bb,null,null,null,1432648315,null,12,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,12,null

[Grays did come last in a study on levels of life satisfaction across the UK](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/25/thurrock-capital-misery), make of that what you will, there's a lot of worry about immigration, some founded, some unfounded.

Chafford Hundred, a small commuter town, has a nice nature reserve, and a bit further east is the Rainham Marshes, one of the nicest bird reserves in the UK.

Thurrock is pretty close to London, accessible by train and car. It's commutable from parts of east London and other parts of Essex, but train travel is pretty expensive in the UK, so you'll have to factor that in. London is London, and will have everything you need and more, but at a price. Most people are priced out of it now, and if you don't command the extra salary for working in London as a teacher, your money won't go too far. Expect to houseshare.

The rest of Essex however can be quite gorgeous in places, especially towards the Suffolk border, and out to the coast. Skip Clacton, and head to Frinton and Brightlinsea, lovely seaside towns, quiet but full of charm.
