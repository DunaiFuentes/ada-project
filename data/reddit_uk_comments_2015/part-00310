The Sun even supported the SNP in it's Scottish editions, whilst supporting the Conservatives in its regular papers. They were also berated by their owners for not being strong enough in their attacks on Labour. Given that they were trying to effect the election, I'd be amazed if there was no link at all between the result and their actions.

Yes, all papers and the like do put spin on titles and articles, the Guardian article being a good example. However, the Telegraph, and the News UK papers are far more guilty of making stories up, using unethical means of getting information, publishing stories ""in the public interest"" (ie completely unimportant), dressing up old stories as new, and doing the above, and ignoring stories/issues altogether, due to a conflict of interests+pressure from their owners/sponsors. This in my eyes makes them less reputable. The Guardian and even more so the Mirror are guilty of the same (bar ethical issues to my knowledge), especially regarding conflicts of interest and publication bias. However, they control a smaller output, and don't have one hugely powerful business controlling them, so they aren't as threatening as the News UK papers.

True, and you've got a point there, but the views from the media are generally given more weight, so their quality is far more important than a Tweet. Not that social media doesn't lead to misinformation, but the media are still the main information source for most people I know.

I don't care what proportion of the press is right wing really, and it's definitely closer to a cyclical relation than a linear as either of those lines of thought would suggest, I just wish they were anywhere near to good quality!

It seems strange that his wrath is entirely focused on the Guardian and the Left. I suppose you could argue that ultimately it's the Guardians responsibility what they choose to publish, however I can't help thinking that if the associate editor of The Guardian had published this in The Spectator his wrath wouldn’t have been focused on The Spectator.

I don't see anything all that terrible about the article anyway. The interview is conducted a friendly style which I suppose is a bit peculiar, particularly when he says he’s had dinner with him a couple of time. However interviewing someone in a friendly way doesn’t signify any sort of approval for their beliefs. Think of the David Frost interviews.

He confronts him with HT’s anti-democratic, sexists and anti-semitic views and his conclusions is “You can say many things about Wahid, and be appalled by much of what he says. But in a democracy he surely has the right to say it. Whatever the government thinks.”

null,null,Bigpinkbackboob,null,null,null,"Joint bank account is an act of faith, no doubt, but so is trusting another person with your money as completely as OP did - which is the only alternative. If you're living with another person and both of your names are on the tenancy/bills, it makes sense for both people to have access to the account the money will be billed from since they're both responsible for it and can each hold the other accountable for any money leaving the account when it shouldn't. 

Yes, you have to trust the other person to pay in their amount and not withdraw any that isn't a joint expense, but I'd argue not doing that takes a much higher level of trust - you cannot see where money is leaving the account, you're going entirely on blind faith which could then create an issue like the one OP is currently experiencing. If you're suggesting OP be the account holder for everything, that's asking Person 2 to put themselves in that exact situation. They have no way of guaranteeing that Person 1 won't screw them over in the same way, and like OP they may not find out until things are quite dire. That would also then be asking Person 1 to be *solely* responsible for the bills - what if Person 2 refuses to pay?

&gt;opening joint bank accounts with somebody you are not in a relationship with is terrible advice.

And being in a relationship is more secure? A messy break-up is a thousand times more likely to create some serious problems than ""Hey, I wanna move out"", much like trusting someone you're not that close to with your money is a bit more of a trust exercise. Neither is better than the other, it's a leap of faith either way.

As I explained before, usually there is a depoist taken. This must, by law, be protected in a deposit scheme. If there is damage during the tenancy the landlord informs the tenant and how much they intend to keep back. If the tenancy agrees then that is fine, obviously. If the tenant disagrees the deposit scheme adjudicator looks at the facts and makes a decision. 

However, here there is no deposit. Therefore nothing to protect, and nothing for an adjudicator to decide on. Hence the Courts must be used. 

As soon as you cause damage (beyond fair wear and tear) the landlord has *legal grounds* to claim money off you. The Court is how he *gets* money off you if you refuse to pay.  

If you break a sofa and the landlord asks for a sum you (and most people) think is fair then you should pay that to him. If he has to take you to Court to get this not only would the Court order you to pay this but also probably a couple of £100 in costs. 

If you break the sofa and the landord asks for stupid money (or makes up damage you have not caused) then you can tell him to go away, and there isn't mucj he can do because he would lose in Court. The burden is always on the landlord to show that damage was caused and the amount asked is reasonable.  

The way things are set up works for you because it stops the landord *holding back* money from your deposit and making *you* fight for it. 

PS - the contract clause you quoted is not what you first said. In that clause the amount is not at the discretion of the landlord - it must be *reasonable*. This is an objective test, and does comply with the law. The landlord can't, under the clause you quoted, just make up a number.

null,null,JackXDark,null,null,null,"Right - here's what you do. It'll take about a year, but it's about the only way to do it. I did something similar in terms of moving from freelancing as a writer and PR person to going into a management level job in the charity sector, although I did pay tax and NI, but the paperwork side of it should be similar:

* Get back involved with your old business, or start a new one, or go on People Per Hour as a freelancer.
* Register with HMRC as self-employed - yes, you'll lose benefits, but sounds like you may do okay.
* Earn enough money so that you're below the tax threshold (unless you want to earn more and pay tax, just remember to work out what you need to pay and put it aside, I fluctuated between earning shitloads some months and a pittance others, so this can be tricky, but doable with planning)
* When the forms from HMRC for tax and NI arrive, complete a tax return as a self-employed sole trader as honestly and accurately as possible. 
* You'll then get a tax code for the next year, which should be enough for any new employer to use.
* You might actually find this form of going legit to work out for you. If not then go to next:
* Write up a cv with some details of the freelance coding etc that you've done. Don't bullshit too much, just don't give the impression it wasn't above board. Because, of course it was, and you've got a year's tax and NI to show for it (even if you don't actually end up paying anything). HR at your new place won't give a shit about what went before that, once you've actually got your foot in the door and given them a legit tax code.
* Get job.
* Don't walk out of it.
* Honestly though, sounds like you may do okay being self-employed.

I suffered severe depression after being bullied at work, and attempted suicide twice. When explaining my situation to the job centre, they simply couldn't have dealt with me any worse. To name just a few of the difficulties I face, I have a daily struggle with interacting with others, get tired very easily from over stimulation and constant checking of how I'm behaving and ensuring I act in an appropriate manner, cannot handle changes to routines, unplanned work or poor communication, and have complete meltdowns every 2-3 weeks due to a build up of stress and anxiety.

I'm not stupid (I recently achieved straight distinctions on an access course and am off to university), and I understand that some people work the system. But the daily struggles I face when not in an organised environment with people I know well are overwhelming to say the least.

The government have no understanding whatsoever of my condition, or those of many, many others. I am not eligible for PIP or enhanced ESA as I am capable of certain types of work and have no care needs, and if the new system for housing benefit had been brought in a few years ago I am in little doubt that I would have found myself homeless. The system does not work and does not meet the needs that I and others have. When I recently had to claim JSA (as I was told ESA was not appropriate), I had to take my mum with me for the first few times, couldn't bring myself to make eye contact and had a minor panic attack when the advisor I was told I would see every week changed without warning.

Stoke's three best chances in the game were 

1.) Glen Johnson missing from the penalty spot (roughly 25')

2.) Martin Skrtel block on Van Ginkel shot inside the box (roughly 80')

3.) Diouf unmarked header that was ""blocked"" by Clyne ""roughly 83')

The first chance came after Van Ginkel got into the space that Gomez was supposed to be marking. This then forced Lovren to come out wide which will normally throw off the positioning of the whole team.

The second chance came after Glen Johnson was left unmarked on the flank and was able to calmly measure a pass to Jonathan Walters who flicked it on for Van Ginkel to have a shot. This could have been prevented if Johnson was pressured and the passing lane to the middle was cut off

The third chance was not necessarily his fault, but still came on his side. Johnson, again unmarked, was able to float a cross to the backpost where Diouf was waiting. If not for Clyne's intervention we might have been 1-0 down.

The lad's 18, so he was targeted far more often than Clyne, but there were a few mistakes he made that he will learn how to deal with after more gametime.

null,null,DukePPUk,null,null,null,"Iirc there are two main criticisms of the boundary changes. The first is the reduction in the number of seats; the system is already biased in favour of the larger parties, and this is likely to increase it.

The more controversial part is ~~changing from basing constituencies on the number of *people* in them to the number of *registered voters.*~~ *continuing to allocate seats based on the number of registered voters, rather than the population.* While there are arguments for doing this, it is likely to favour the Conservatives quite a bit (areas with large numbers of those ineligible or not registered to vote tend not to vote Conservative, and will return fewer MPs).

To use an extreme example for how this could be bad, it doesn't matter how independent the body for drawing up the actual lines is if they're told to only count Conservative voters.

The other big change to electoral law proposed by the Conservatives was to let those who left the UK over a decade ago vote. Again this is expected to benefit them a bit.

And you'd think that if they can manage all these changes they'd at least be able to sort out the stuff with prisoners...

*Edit: I'd remembered this incorrectly; the UK already allocates constituencies based on the number of registered voters, but this is not the normal way of doing things, and there has been a big push to switch to population.

**Burnham**

Pros:

- Experienced, Confident
- Decent Manifesto
- Polls say he fairs well under electability
- Gets backing from lots of experienced and centrist people

Cons:

- I liked Miliband, but I know there's plenty who didn't, not sure how he's going to win back voters
- Flip Flops, not sure where he stands. Seems like an artificial politician.

**Corbyn**

Pros:

- Plenty of great policies
- Big crowds
- Polls say he can gain a decent chunk of votes, even in England
- A bit like Thatcher, he has the potential to shift the political centre. Every time we shift right, so do the Conservatives
- Like his views on improving democracy in the party

Cons:

- May loose more votes than he gains, seen as a leftist loony by plenty
- Untrusted on the economy and defence
- Know a few N Irish who don't like his stance on the IRA
- Derides UKIP Voter
- Argentina, Hamas, Palestine... - Agree with some points, disagree with others

**Cooper**

Pros:

- Economic credibility
- Confident
- Can gain the women vote
- Some good policies

Cons:

- Sticks to rhetoric on austerity and welfare
- Generally dull
- Married to Balls

**Kendall**

Pros:

- Can win back Conservatives
- Can win back non working class UKIP Voters
- Not supported in polls

Cons:

- Adamantly opposes electoral reform
- Generally feels dull and acts ""robotic""
- May cause a split in party membership, often divisive",null,0,null,1439325566,null,null,false,0,ctzkrvz,null,t3_3gla2p,null,null,null,t3_3gla2p,null,null,null,1440420721,null,2,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

&gt; Puffett underwent a number of assessments, including a psychometric test, listening and reading comprehension, mechanical comprehension, and a structured interview. ""There were six of us and they whittled it down during the day. If you didn't pass a test you were told as much and left. Two out of six of us made it through. It was nerve-racking.""

&gt; The programme is modular and trainees have to pass each stage before they can move on to the next. ""The first nine or 10 weeks were in the classroom, learning about trackside rules and regulations. There was four weeks' traction training on trains we would be driving, and training on how trains work and the sorts of faults that might occur.""

&gt; ""You have to do 200 hours with an instructor, with a third taking place in the dark,"" Puffett explains. ""Then there is a week-long assessment based on everything you have learned."" It should take nine months to complete, but for Puffett a shortage of instructors made it longer.

&gt; Only once enough hours have been clocked up can trainee drivers finally go solo. ""I was nervous on the day,"" he says. ""You keep your fingers crossed that nothing will go wrong – even though you have had the training you still don't want it to happen. It was strange not to have anyone there, but it was fine.""

http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/04/how-become-train-driver

&gt; The first four weeks were spent doing theory, followed by 17 weeks of stock training – learning about the trains from the inside out. ""The trains on every line are different,"" says Jiles ""The Northern Line trains were introduced in 1995, Jubilee in 1997 and Bakerloo in 1972. You learn every inch of the trains – every switch, every mechanism, so if something goes wrong, you can fix it.""

&gt; Next came learning to drive the trains. Trainee operators can practise on a simulator (the public can try one out at the Transport Museum in London's Covent Garden), but because the underground system is so busy, there is no opportunity to learn by driving empty vehicles: you go straight from simulator to an in-service train complete with passengers, albeit with an instructor at your side. Jiles points out, with a smile, that the instructor can always press the red emergency button to stop the train if things go wrong.

&gt; Trainees have to learn all the signals, all the possible shunts – everything about the line they are working on. This is no mean feat: Golders Green, for example, has about 50 possible shunting positions. Driving lessons last for three months and each trainee has to complete a minimum of 100 hours before taking their test. Every part of the training is examined, and if the trainee fails, he or she goes back to scratch. The driving test alone lasts eight hours.

 Just searched for it and found [this](http://http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/current-accounts/flexone/whats-flexone) and it looks really promising, debit card is what i'd need for online payments and in store. Mobile and internet banking is nice because most banks i have looked at either dont have it or just internet banking. Not the best with money so the savings account is nice and i have an iPhone and contactless makes everything easier. One problem though is that the closest Nationwide to me would take time to get to which isn't a problem with online banking but registering etc to get the card and depositing money would be an hours walk and if it is the best place to go i will figure out how long it would take on the train but for now i will keep looking.

I am sure there are several successful schools out there, especially in such a deprived area of poverty like Hammersmith. 


It has become the conventional wisdom, in the right-wing politics and press, that academies and free schools are an unqualified success and the only route to improve an under-performing school. I do not see any data that supports this view. It reminds me of what John F. Kennedy said:“the great enemy of truth is very often not the lie…but the myth, persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.""

null,null,quinn_drummer,null,null,null,"It seems TfL are *only* focusing on the pay aspect in that press release, which they *know* will get the public on their side

Lets look at what [RMT](http://www.scribd.com/doc/270888061/London-Underground-Strike-Leaflet) have to say about it 

&gt; Our action is in response to the impact of a £4.2bn cutsprogramme imposed by the Government and Mayor of London. All four Unions areunited with members voting over whelmingly for strike action, with 90% plus yes votes andturnouts of over 50% (markedly better than the Tory Governments 24% share of the eligible votersin the General Election). The strike is in opposition to LU demands that we acceptadditional night working andworking at weekends. They have made this a condition of any pay rise in pay at all for the next two years.

&gt; RMT members on LondonUnderground(LU) already work 7day/24 hour shift patterns. All we are asking is for a fair increase in pay that recognises the record number of passengers using the Tube and the massive productivity gains we’ve already delivered. The two year pay deal,would in fact be a below inflation deal, in real terms a pay cut. The 0.75% pay offer wouldincrease wages by between £225 per year for the lowest paid and £450 per year for thehighest paid, compare this to the £7,000 per year that has beenaccepted by MP’s. 

&gt; We do not oppose night running on the Tube but we insist that enough staff are employed so that the burden of Fri/Sat nightsworking does not fall on those already working unsociablehours. The proposed CSA roster for South Kensington gives staffone long weekend off in every 27 weeks. We have a separate butassociated dispute over specificplans for LU stations. LU is cutting 850 jobs leaving many stations dangerously under-staffed. LU is lying to the publicby claiming there will be more staff in ticket halls to help passengers. This is plainly untrue. Ticket office staff are notcoming out from behind glass. The jobs in ticket offices havebeen cut and passengers will have to rely on self-service machines to buy tickets. Many medium sized stations outside of Zone 1 will have their staffing halved. In reality, many stations will be left unstaffed as there will not be enough staff to cover training, annual leave and sickness. Safety will be an issue; assaults on staff are already up 44%. With less staff there will bea reduced service of care for disabled passengers. 

&gt; Unstaffed stations willmean many women will feelunsafe to travel late at night, sexual assaults on women have increased on the Tube. 

&gt; Our members will be expected to work anywhere on aline with just 24 hours notice oftheir duties. This will make it impossible to plan a life outside of work. At a day’s notice wecould be told our duty hasmoved and that we will need toleave for work at 2am or 3am in the morning to catch a staff taxi. None of the huge increase in travelling time will be in paid time. LU wants to be able to take staff from one under-staffed station to plug gaps in another rather than employ enough people in each local area.  

&gt; Fleet maintenance are also striking in protest at LU’s refusal to increase the number of train maintainers on duty toallow them to prepare trains for the additional demands of night running. Less maintenance time due to night running will potentially increase breakdownsin the service and also the number of accidents.  

&gt; London Underground is ignoring agreements it has with RMT and the other unions and is conducting sham talks, which it refuses to even call negotiations. The company is seeking to casualise working arrangementsso as to create a workforce that can be deployed anywhere at short notice with no consideration for the work/lifebalance of our members. Staff are calling LU’s plans a demand for a Martini workforce: Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere! All four Unions are united in thisstruggle to defend our members jobs, pay and conditions. We arealso united in demanding thatour Underground is fully staffedto maximise the safety of the travelling public

null,null,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; I don't deny that, but the right wing press - those owned by News UK especially - were running a campaign to slander Ed Milliband. The Sun even supported the SNP in it's Scottish editions, whilst supporting the Conservatives in its regular papers. They were also berated by their owners for not being strong enough in their attacks on Labour. Given that they were trying to effect the election, I'd be amazed if there was no link at all between the result and their actions.

But so have many other mediums attacked Cameron. Cameron is often the subject of spoofing, slander and abuse online and the target of mockery on TV. Whilst I don't believe the BBC is left-wing in news production I think that comedy and other entertainment programs and quite left wing. Right-wing people moan about that all the time.

Ultimately we have a free press so I think time spent venting on that is wasted. At the end of the day you have to play the cards you're given in the game you're playing. This is why Blair was successful, he did what he needed to to win. That includes gaining the trust of middle England. 

&gt; I don't care what proportion of the press is right wing really, and it's definitely closer to a cyclical relation than a linear as either of those lines of thought would suggest, I just wish they were anywhere near to good quality!

It wouldn't be fair to blame it all on Asians. The problem goes both ways and it's not black and white. There is hostility on both sides and one side isn't blameable for all the crap. 

One thing to realise is how both communities see themselves. Most black people see themselves as the opposite of white people. For Asians I meet there is very little difference other than skin colour regarding Caribbean and White people. Same type of names, same native language, same religion, same history and generally same culture. Whereas Asians are not only different but very distinct from general western cultural norms. Just as for me there is very little difference between an Irish Catholic and an English Anglican other than sect and accent, however people in Bogside would probably disagree.

null,null,easywormfood,UnionFlag,"Triumph TT600, XJ600 Divvy",null,"I used to have a 2010 XJ6 for a commuter from new, extremely well put together machine like everything Yamaha  this side of the millennium. It's not the fastest, but it is very forgiving and easy to handle and I think it would make a great first ""big"" bike, and an excellent commuter. I owned it a year and rode it every day, pissing rain snow and wind, sold it when I went back to uni. 

I have also had a play on the ER-6F a couple of times (local dealership got used to me test riding everything repeatedly, good lads!). This a little bit more dynamic, fun, it's a bit lighter I think, and looks great. I don't think it's suitability for longer distance riding is quite up there with the XJ6, but twins are lively and torquey, some people - myself included - find twins and singles a lot more fun than trips and fours. Lots of vibrations compared to the XJ6. Probably sound great with a less stuffy exhaust.  Again it's not fast kit, but if they're anything like the venerable ER5 they will be extremely reliable and solidly put together and will go on to pretty outrageous mileages for a bike. 

I would add though, that as it's your first big bike you are going to drop it and might put it down, it's a fact of motorcycling. I never had a 125, went from a 50 to a two-stroke 250 as you could when I passed, but the next one, a 400 was heavier and that went on its side a few times. If you do that with a newish bike that's cost £4k, you're going to be a bit upset. An older, second hand machine will cost less, and most things Japanese made since the turn of the century will go on into six-digit mileages. I would consider the Yamaha Fazer strongly as well, they are renowned for being excellent commuters and mileages over 100k are not uncommon - you can pick up a good one for under £2000. 

Edit: Something else I test rode a few times were the various Triumph twins. The Bonne (both flavours) and Scrambler are amazing fun, I don't think they can be beaten. I've owned a Triumph TT600 (pre-facelift Daytona with a very snatchy fuel map), and it's built pretty well aside from the shift seal failing and pissing oil down the motorway a couple of times. I would imagine the twins are just as good. The Thruxton is a hoot, I borrowed it for a test ride and went from Exeter up to Okehampton and back at full chat on the A30. They're no more expensive than what you're looking at, and they are just seriously nice bits of kit and again not too fast or scary or unforgiving for a first big bike. 10/10 grin factor! And a bit more interesting than basically a new divvy (I say that with love as a divvy owner!). Test ride them all in the same day if you can, you will go for the Triumph I guarantee it. 

Only downside to the Trumpets is servicing and parts can be terrifyingly expensive if you don't know how to do it yourself, I expect the twins are reasonably easy to get serviced but a top end service (the big one with shims set) on the trips and fours can be upwards of £600 and no one round here likes to touch them except the big dealerships. On the TT you have to take the engine out the bike to get to the head.

I dont spend a huge amount of time in this sub, but I do see this myth perpetuated in its various forms when I visit.

 Also the Tory press loves to keep the myth going and it is working just as much now as it did in the run-up to the election.  As John Stewart once said the Right wing are very good at perpetuating a lie.

&gt;You should probably start knowing and respecting your enemy though..

This is why I dont really like to comment in this sub. If I criticise Labour I am a Tory, if I criticise the Tories I am Labour. When did UK politics become so Americanised that we emulate a 2 party system to a tee?

I have probably voted in more GE's  than the days that George Osbourne has worked his only job outside of politics -folding towels for Selfridges while I voted for Major.  

&gt;The blairite spin doctors were purged from Labour. Or left. And Labour suffered accordingly in the election.

Yes a bit of that, but your statements are so final, you speak as if there is no other possible explanation for a narrow majority. For example you could say the Tory press came out in full force, personally attacking Milliband more than Scargill ever suffered from the press (I can provide sources for this if you want). 

This thread epitomises the partisan idiocy that is creating serious problems to our once far more superior version of party politics that the US enjoys. It wont be long until we have Fox news pundits on our airwaves.

You are fucking kidding.

Oh good you are.

Wait...

&gt; The ability to walk and cycle to, from and around the Arena area and key routes to and from it should be the top priority and should be maximised.

Oh had me worried for a second there.

&gt; The Arena and all associated developments should conform to the highest possible social and environmental standards in all respects, using innovative low carbon and low waste designs and systems, energy saving and local renewable energy generation technologies.

Yeah, this would make a decent Onion article.

Can you change your living situation? Rent, council tax, internet &amp; energy could be potentially reduced since you're spending £500+ per month on these. Are you living alone? Have a partner you're not currently living with? That could be a future door to suggest/open. Have any friends, family who could do with some extra cash that live near your work/area? 

What's the situation on the vehicle? Is 'car payment' for ownership, lease, does that include tax, servicing, repairs? When does that deal end? How old is your car and what fuel economy does it get? Assuming you're getting 50mpg you're doing around 800 miles per month, would it be worthwhile moving closer to work so you could ditch the car altogether and save the £264+ per month you're currently spending?

That wasn't what my post concerned. It concerned whether austerity was an ideology as opposed to 'common sense'.

&gt;You cannot borrow indefinitely.

Someone better tell Osborne that then, because he is. 

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/UK_National_Debt.svg/780px-UK_National_Debt.svg.png

&gt;But after 5 years of Austerity in the name of cutting the deficit, telling people you are going to reverse all that work, to do the very thing that the Tories have used to label Labour irresponsible, is political suicide.

That will, to a large extent, depend on the state of the country in 5 years time. But again, I wasn't debating what was good politics. 

&gt;The Tories are excellent at the 'National economy is like a household' thing, and its so-called ""common sense""

They're excellent at it because it's simple to grasp. It's harder to help people understand the economics of governments. 

&gt;And printing money is a much worse idea. Some borrowing I'll accept, but printing money is just economic illiteracy.

It goes on all the time. Never heard of Quantitative Easing?

&gt; If printing money was a quick economic fix, don't you think someone (other than Zimbabwe) would have tried it by now?

Between March and November 2009, the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England decided to purchase £200 billion of financial assets (e.g. they printed money), mostly UK Government debt or 'gilts'.  Since then the MPC has decided on further purchases:  £75 billion in October 2011; £50bn in February 2012 and £50bn in July 2012. 

Look out Zimbabwe, eh?

Microneedling needs a LOT of research, it is risky for even those with healthy skin because it is (*hopefully*) controlled injury triggering the 'normal' healing cascade without causing infection or irritation from other products. Amazon and eBay are not the best places to purchase equipment, there are counterfeit branded rollers out there.

I would **strongly** recommend you seek the advice of your dermatologist before attempting microneedling on a dermatological condition that affects collagen deposition. I suspect you would be safer with broad spectrum sunscreen and constructive actives instead of destructive techniques.

If you do get the go-ahead from your dermatologist, check out the free and comprehensive guide on the Owndoc website. I personally use their products (but not on areas of my skin affected by rosacea). You may even like to read the guide before talking to your dermatologist, so you are up with terminology and current recommendations.

Experts in the field of microneedling include Dr. Lance Setterfield and Dr. Desmond Fernandes, nobody on YouTube most of the videos are way out of date technique wise.

What's the alternative? Prime minister Andy ""weathercock"" Burnham? Prime minister Yvette ""blank slate"" Cooper? Or prime minister Liz ""red Tory"" Kendall? The main criticism of Corbyn is that he is unelectable, but at least the man stands for something. 

The other contenders are uninspiring and either have poorly defined principles and ideologies or ones that I don't agree with. Fundamentally, they offer no really substantial alternative to a Conservative party that also occupies the centre ground. I don't agree with everything that Corbyn says, but he comes across as a genuine human being and not a politicianBot3000^TM. He has principles that he is prepared to defend and explain and doesn't change his mind arbitrarily on the basis of public opinion. You're resigned to electoral defeat if Corbyn wins. Do you honestly in your heart believe that Andy fucking Burnham is going to be the leader that will inspire the confidence of the nation and deliver decisive electoral victory? 

Corbyn is a refreshing alternative to a Labour party that increasingly is trying to steal Conservative votes, and in doing so has left a gaping void in the political landscape of the united kingdom where socialist progressive ideas should be aired and discussed. He might not win, but having a watered-down Conservative party take over from the actual Conservative party is a victory only in name. I'd rather have a voice to represent me that isn't in power than to have no voice and get the same shit from slightly less odious people in red ties instead of blue ones.

My Versys is my first full-sized bike and it was absolutely heartbreaking when I dropped her in a parking lot like a bellend. Obviously not everyone is a complete dong like myself, but it adds a little bit of extra stress if the bike you're doing a lot of your learning on is particularly precious. And let's not beat about the bush - if all you've ridden so far outside of training is a 125, you've got a lot of stuff still to learn.

That said, you can get crash bungs and shit like that to make it less of an issue. And I'm far from sensible when it comes to this stuff, so I'd go for the MT-07 every time.

If the price is an issue, I'd look at the ER-6F next. I'm biased, since I'm invested in the whole Kawasaki 650 twin thing, but it's a very nice engine - predictable and fairly smooth, reasonably quick but unlikely to kill you. Very popular bikes, and with good reason

Ninja 300 I'd steer clear of, because the idea of opting for that much of a power deficit for more money seems weird to me. They're nice, well-made bikes, but they're slow, and anyone telling you otherwise hasn't got their head around how quick bikes can be yet.

For other options, you might consider one of the slightly older ducati monsters (696 or 796) which are a bit prettier, and allegedly just as reliable. I don't totally buy that, but maybe they are. Do your own research into that sort of thing and decide how much risk you're willing to take.

You've also got the option of going for a lot more power and buying something seriously fast from the early or mid 2000s, which will still keep you under £6k if you're smart. Insurance will likely be higher so check that out first. Think carefully also about whether you've got the self-control to pick up something like an old R1 or Fireblade. I totally would go for that stupid decision if I wasn't stuck with an A2 license, so I say go for it if you feel up for it, but all the self-righteous folks who think you're an idiot for even considering it do have a point - it's a lot easier to hurt yourself when you can hit nearly 100mph in first or second gear. 

I'm inclined to agree about the SV650, S or otherwise. I'm sure it's a great bike to ride, and it's allegedly a surprisingly good track bike, but I cannot stand the looks of that thing. Don't buy a bike you hate.

I've been rambling for a bit now, so I cba to give reasons, but here's some other bikes worth looking at

One time that sticks in my mind was when I was waiting to overtake a delivery lorry or something one day. 

I had a cyclist decked out in all the Lycra and equipment shoot up my nearside to try and get past, only to realise that he himself couldn't get past.

He's sort of stood on his pedals waiting to get past. It's clear for me so I check my mirrors and pull away. As I get past the lorry I check my nearside mirror to see where he was and watch him fall arse over tit as he's lost his balance and couldn't unclip his cleats in time. 

I dunno. Made me laugh anyway. 

Anyway, yeah. Oxford is a nightmare for cyclists and pedestrians. I think the biggest problem is the tourist who somehow thing that viewing a city is best achieved with their heads tucked inside their anuses.

Another time I was going down Cowley Road again and there's a kid of say, 9 or 10 cycling down the road on his bmx. No helmet, of course. I didn't overtake him at that point as I didn't think it was safe to, we were in a 20 zone and there was a traffic island coming up. 

The speed limit changed from a 20 to a 30 150 yards or so up the road so I figure I'll just wait until then.

Just as we get to the 30, I indicate and pull out, only for the kid to pull out in front of me to turn right without warning and slow down to a crawl. Heart stopped briefly, brakes were slammed on, passengers screamed, and the bus bottomed out at the front (suspension on that bus was softer than baby shit).

The Oxford experience, which is what many visitors seek, is almost exclusively for undergraduate and some graduate students. Here, the experience is being in (what I would call) a boarding school: dealing with the schedule of term, the tutorials, the clubs, the exams, watching the boat races, etc. This experience is almost exclusively reserved for term time, and yes, as a non-student, you're excluded. You might as well ask ""how do I get the high school experience?"" 

Apart from that, Oxford offers very little. When my friends come to visit, I give them a tour of the university, and tell them about the idiosyncrasies. I take them to formal dinner.

Clindamycin is a good antibiotic, but some need a combination topical or an oral antibiotic with a topical. Many prescription topicals for acne mean you need broad spectrum sunscreen, I *think* clindamycin is one of them - reread the patient information leaflet.

You may well not get a referral to a dermatologist until you have tried several common treatments or your skin is scarring (not PIH or PIE, true scars). You do have the right to consult another doctor in the same practice or switch practices entirely.

You seem to be doing a lot of cleansing, this can easily be overdone. Ideally you would do one or two cleanses a day in total, not four. Several products also have fragrance and/ or drying alcohol which can contribute to problems in acne prone skin (irritation is the baby sister of inflammation).

null,null,davidpbrown,null,null,null,"&gt; the fact a piece of reasoning is fallacious tells you nothing at all about whether it's actually correct

A statement predicated on a fallacy, is false.

&gt; , and the number of people who simply name a fallacy then sit back and consider the job done and the argument won is downright depressing.

Of course, naming a fallacy without making it apparent is not a job done.

&gt; Much more useful (and interesting, and less irritating) to actually demonstrate the flaw in the argument to hand.

Quite right.. but in doing so that proves the fallacy; it's one and the same.

&gt; while it might be worthwhile learning to recognise the pattern of flawed reasoning, it's much more worthwhile to be able to dismantle an argument built upon such shaky foundations without naming something from a memorised list of fallacies.

It's not a matter of memorising them, it a matter of having internalised them being able to deal with them. The name is not important, the nature of the fallacy is. If you're unfamiliar with certain of the fallacies, memorised names or not, you are liable to fall foul of them. One fallacy is as bad as the next, better to avoid all of them.. that's the whole point of them.

null,null,Mr_Monotone,null,null,null,"This isn't an easy question to answer. The different countries that make up the UK have some pretty distinct politics and different priorities, which is the cause of the split between the countries. Under the current system the vast majority of MPs are from English constituencies which makes sense based purely on population. Unfortunately this leaves the other countries feeling disenfranchised since even if every single one of their politicians voted one way a relatively small percentage of the English MPs could vote them down. 

A federal system would solve this problem, but might then have the opposite problem. Whilst it would allow the individual countries power over themselves and an equal say in how the UK functions as a whole it isn't quite so easy to split regional and federal concerns. Budgets are the obvious point of contention as whilst Scotland could make a go of self funding it is doubtful that Wales could. Either the standard of living would drop in Wales or additional funds would have to be siphoned to the Welsh. This would, rightly or wrongly, cause other countries to become upset that they footed more of the bill and didn't have a greater say. Countries like England would likely be upset at the disparity between population and control. Honestly I can't think of a federal system where one region has so completely outnumbered the others.

Ultimately I think that before we can have a closer political union there needs to be more common ground between the various countries and we need to start seeing each other as part of the same whole. Because without that there will be resentment from the perceived unfairness of one country putting in more than it's share or having a disproportional voice.

To take a non-controversial example: Carragher found some great form and managed to take Skrtel's place *after* the decision to retire(I think it was Skrtel, could have been Agger). But that was the reason he played more games in his final season than with Dalglish. So the argument about him playing more games in his final season is a little mute, the decision to retire was made much earlier and therefore could be argued it was because of him losing his first team space with Rodgers. 

There are plenty of other counterpoints to a lot of your arguments. I'll just take one. Re Agger: you have just thrown your opinion in there ""I don't think he had the heart to compete for a place"" and ignored, for example, Agger's interview where he talks about being isolated by Brendan after being made vice captain (which makes his situation different to Agger).   

I'm not saying that the people you are trying to counter with this post are correct. But I think this is an equally skewed picture of some of these transfer stories to fit a narrative.

Or in [this equally bizarre article](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/04/27/writers-withdraw-pen-gala-protest-award-charlie-hebdo/), he attempts to dismiss the abuse and murder of LGBT people outside of Western democracies on the basis that ""U.S. officials...  gin up anger toward Putin or Iran by highlighting the maltreatment of those countries’ LGBT citizens.""

Greenwald believes that no democratic country should be permitted to proscribe attempts to destroy it and harm its citizens and that murder is an understandable response if Muslims are offended. His implication that it's hypocritical to arrest Choudary (not convict - arrest; he will still have the benefit of due legal process) is strangely disproportional when considered alongside his contention that the Charlie Hebdo killers were provoked. Does he think that executing Choudary would have been more fitting?

I get that part alot, theirs a massive gap in wealth between England and the rest of the UK. However, if states realised they had to foot some of the budget themselves it could stimulate more jobs in some ways, having to take responsibility for themselves abit more. I often wonder how the USA does it with their states, in terms of some states having to pay out other states.

The whole constituencies thing is abit unfair in that if the English vote in a right wing government my votes mean nothing either way.   I think you'd need to divide up the country even more to make things abit more evenly spread around and thats just not fair on England. That in itself is enough to make Scotland go independent.

Id just love to see people in the UK come together more, i often feel so separated from the Scots and Welsh, more so the English too and it doesn't help things over here when even the English dont understand our stuggles.

Because using those skills means either being a self employed freelancer, which takes more time than I can afford in the short term, or going to a tech company that's close to me.

I live in a city of 100k people, in the middle of nowhere, with a decently ranked University for Computer Science.  Whilst it would be ideal to get a tech job, I might have a long wait.

So that leaves call centres, and warehouses, and other grunt work.  I can definitely hack that for 6-12 months, I think.  And hopefully somebody here is going to say ""You're fine.  Tell them you were a freelancer, and the work dried up.  They don't check.  They don't care.""

- I accept that joke wasn't necessary, but some people may have found it funny

- I actually don't like Strax either, but a lot of people love him so what ya gonna do?

- I don't see why The Doctor recovering from his regeneration quickly is a problem. The effects of regeneration are unpredictable and sometimes doesn't last that long.

- While the ""oxygen sharing"" was unnecessary, it was still lauded for having a same-sex kiss on family television (and nominated for an award). I can understand if you didn't like it, but I don't see how it could affect your view on the episode as a whole.

- We didn't see Clara in ""Asylum of the Daleks"", that was one of her splinters called Oswin Oswald. As for Clara in the rest of Series 7, personally I found her to be seriously underdeveloped and inconsistent (in fairness there was some serious last minute changes made to her character) and found that Series 8 gave her some much needed development. I'm not sure what you mean be ""uninsightful"" and while I suppose she could be seen as ""bitchy"", I'm glad she actually has clear flaws which weren't apparent in Series 7 and to be fair some of The Doctor's behaviour in the episode would rile up anyone. How is she a ""damsel in distress""? She handled herself very well when in mortal danger.

- I'm not sure how you came to the conclusion that Half-Face Man didn't jump. Maybe The Doctor pushed him, maybe he didn't, its kept obscure so you can come to your own decision. Or at least that's how I saw it.

Is this episode indicative of the rest of the season? In some ways yes, in some ways no. There are some more light-heated episodes that have some of the comedy you might not like, but there are also plenty of dark episodes which have next to no ""cringey comedy"". In the end, these things are very subjective and you'll have to continue watching to make your own mind up. Personally I loved Series 8 and hope you will too.

A new tube driver earns £50k


The basic salary for a new doctor is £22,600 in the first year, £28k in the second and in speciality training (which takes roughly between 5-8 years) pay is between £37k and £69k.


That means only Consultants with a basic wage of £75k are guaranteed to earn more than tube drivers and that's after a hell of a lot of extra training of probably around 10 years since graduating med school if they go to consultant level straight away and is about as much responsibility as it is possible to have as a doctor, which is why some doctors choose never even to reach consultant level.


Not to mention that medical school itself is a minimum of 5 years, obviously entirely unpaid with tuition fees and student loans on top. And doctors certainly don't have that 36 hour work week and many get less annual leave.

null,null,ClayKavalier,null,null,null,"I ruled out Chelsea, Manchester City, and Manchester United on general principal. Many of my fellow Timbers fans are Gooners, appreciating Arsenal's tactics and development system. I briefly gravitated toward Spurs as well, but it never felt right. As a Timbers fan, I'm used to struggle, obscurity, and mediocrity, so climbing onto the bandwagon of a perennially successful club wasn't a priority. I tend to dislike buying success in any area and do appreciate an underdog.

Given my age and taste music, I could have easily become a Manchester City/United fan in the 90s, probably gravitating to whatever team Johnny Marr or Bernard Sumner happen to like. However, I grew up in Kansas, where American gridiron football and baseball reigned supreme. I didn't get into proper football/soccer until moving to Portland and being convinced to attend a Timbers game by a coworker. Having little idea what was happening on the pitch, despite some similarities between soccer and hockey, with which I was more familiar, it was the fans and the community that first grabbed hold of me. 

In 2011, Portland Timbers played a friendly versus Ajax. I wasn't able to attend the game but friends talked about it enough that I really started getting interested in the history and tactics of the sport. So, my trajectory to Swansea was basically Ajax -&gt; Total Football -&gt; Barcelona -&gt; Tika Taka -&gt; Michael Laudrup -&gt; Swansea City. Coincidentally, Portland got a new coach, Caleb Porter, in 2013 and he has tried to adopt similar tactics.

People choosing Corbyn want a change from the status quo that the FPTP system has entrenched in our democracy. Currently there are large swathes of electorate disillusioned with and unrepresented in politics. They don't care about Labour's ability to win marginal seats because to them the existence of marginal seats is an absurd consequence of an unrepresentative and broken system. 

Corbyn represents a chance to change politics for the better in the long term by offering the  real choice that many have been craving. If your attempt to dissuade them from Corbyn consists of arguments that his appeal isn't widespread enough for the one-size-fits-all semi-homogeneous centrism of the current political climate then you've missed the point completely. 

You might find it hilarious, but I think the health of our democracy is pretty tragic. And this isn't sour grapes, I think it's particularly abysmal that UKIP's 10% vote share translates to 0.15% of the seats in parliament, and I fucking hate UKIP.

Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness tweeted that those who organised the ""so-called anti-internment demonstration"" bore ""full responsibility"" for the violence.

It may not have been the people running the parade itself but it was those who were their to witness it. 

Look, I dont care for either parade but its not the parade itself that was in the wrong, it was the people chucking bombs. If they just cleared off when they were told to then their would not have been a riot, but they obviously were looking to cause violence. 

&gt;didn't actually take part in the rioting you were suggesting the fact that they stopped there led to the rioting and that is what the consequences were
Yes, see the qoute above. 
And yeah, same shit as the 12th, whos denying that the people who caused shit on the 12th arent as bad????

Over the match I'd say Lovren was our best player, followed semi-closely by Clyne, and possibly add Emre in as the third contender for the award.

I'm also really surprised at how low Lallana's and Gomez' rataings were. Sure Lallana was quiet, but he was kept quiet by Stoke getting numbers back and around him well in exactly the same Phil was kept quiet for the first hour and a bit.

Gomez did make two, maybe three errors but other than that I think he had a pretty good game, and should get more plaudits for keeping Walters relatively quiet.

I see 0 quotes beyond Jose's post match comments (which don't reference anything but his frustration at the time). Granted, none of us have any idea what's going on behind closed doors but last season it seemed he had nothing but praise for the medical team. Yes there were incidents (Oscar's and Courtois mentioned below), but by and large our medical team was a huge factor in us winning the league. 

Wasn't there a post just recently about how Jose went to department meetings and made a big deal that he was equal's with them? That doesn't seem to fit in character. Unless there's more outlets picking it up, I'm gonna guess that it's not very legit. 

If it does turn out to be true, I'm sure there's so much more to the story than just Saturdays match. Like I said, for me it doesn't line up with what we hear about him.

Hi there,

Looking to get rid of my G1 Gaming 980Ti as I'd prefer the HoF due to its aesthetics. It is fully boxed, accessories and manuals are all in tact.

It clocks quite well, I've managed to get a stable 1570/2000 clock in Unigine Valley &amp; Heaven, and ramp it down to 1540 for games as they test the GPU differently. It has no coil whine, or anything like that.

I'm looking to get around £510, which is £500 + £10 for postage via next day UPS. Does this sound about right?

Cheers.

Let's think about this logically, it isn't like Mikel is taking a dozen shots a game and missing them, he's been instructed by the best manager in the world to boss the midfield, hold possession and distribute the ball. When he's on the field he has been given orders to shut out our opponents and hold on to the lead. He does that role very well too. Just because it's rare to find players like him whose role is to hold onto leads does not make him ""sub-par"". Don't compare Mikel to Matic or Ramires, that isn't what his job description is. The guy has strict instructions and what makes him good is he executes them every time he's on the field. Imagine being such a fantastic footballer that you are playing for Chelsea FC and your manager tells you not to ever drive the ball forward, to take 0 risks and only make astute short passes. Can you not see the discipline and professionalism that executing that would require? There are so few players in the world that could handle that job and we have one of them. The guy was earmarked as the [second best](http://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/players/player=234463/profile.html) **attacking** footballer behind Messi in the 2005 U20 World Cup and as a club we morphed him into a player who ignores his normal attacking instincts and acts in the benefit of the team.

Mikel's job is to win us points, not score goals. Mourinho knows with him on the field we are that much harder to break down. Even if we bought other players this window Mikel would have stayed because he offers Mourinho a way to close out a game. He will remain at the club until he wants to leave too because league points, not goals, win titles. We can find more well rounded players on the market and use them as starters but implying he would have to get the boot when we do is stupid considering his role in the squad is to close out games.

Also Mikel should get more minutes than Kenedy (pending work permit), Ake and RLC in the Premier League.

""Quick witted and feisty"" are not acceptable character traits. She was extremely lacking in character in the previous Series, so this series gave her some more character flaws and made her more interesting.

And I highly disagree that she was uninsightful and bitchy.

She has a very hard time getting used to the new Doctor because of how different he is, and a central theme throughout the series is both of them beginning to understand each other and develop their dynamic which we'll see more of in S9 I suppose.

There is a ""homeless charity"" called [Emmaus](http://www.emmaus.org.uk/search/postcode/46?q=Da5+4as) they do the same thing as the British Heart Foundation shops but they use ex-homeless ""volunteers""  basically they provide homeless people with food, a room, training, free furniture/electrics and about £30 per week but the homeless have to sign over their housing and JSA/ESA benefits and do a 40 hour week.  They charge something like £260 a year for a TV license which residents have to have (compared with about £145.50 that the BBC charges).

Can't remember if he said he'd actively tried to pitch it to anyone, though.

I'd welcome that kind of programme for UK politics.

Caught it the other night and thought the sketches didn't really work but those were balanced out even by their fairly light discussion of coverage of refugees or Corbyn.

Don't see a similar programme working for Scottish politics alone; you'd have to think it'd be more of a struggle for writers looking for material.

&gt;*Couldn't those green supporters **be genuine** in the fact that they would support a labour party under (I imagine) Corbyn? **I thought they were trying to stop people from right wing parties from voting,** but they only found 20?

I think that most of those supporters could be genuine.

I, being the UKIP supporter I am, personally know that many fellow supporters advocate Corbyn despite a distaste for his politics. Even both Carswell and Farage have openly sympathised. The thing is that he, like many have been saying, seems to hold integrity. We believe that he has a conviction which he'd like to follow through. I'd, to a degree, compromise on my beliefs if the alternate messenger seemed honest. Though, for me, not enough to vote a Corbyny Labour in any parliamentary elections. That's what I have UKIP for. It's not really a compromise though as I do thoroughly support UKIP policy. Our sympathies are often framed as if we are trying to tactically absorb Labour. A pretty cynical attitude in which I don't think, in recent instances, are priority.

I wouldn't call it a matter of left and right. Just radical. That's why I both simultaneously fear him but want him to win leadership. It's, in my opinion, a dangerous gamble though as I think that he may possibly be the compromise many would click to. I don't want that to happen, but I don't want him to disappear either. I want him to provide a new angle of scrutiny and consideration, but get no major influence in Westminster or other institutions. I, of course, want that for UKIP. Back to Corbyn though, I want him to consolidate and refine the Labour identity so that the landscape is diverse. I want him to be a new counter as I think he would be not, for example, just be anti Tory for the sake of it and would be bold in his scrutiny. There'd be a more meaningful party to vote for. I still wish to convince others of my priorities though. In short, I want Corbyn to win the leadership, *but* lose Prime Ministerial roles etc. As a new flavour in politics would make us all more considerate, but any significant weight on his words in general may damage the UK.

As for the result against Watford: everyone here is acting like it's the worst thing that could have happened. But guess what.. We still got a point and didn't lose the match. No it wasn't the result we expected and wanted but that's why they play the matches. Not everything that should happen is going to. It's a long season and a lot can happen along the way. We won't win them all. Some of the ones we should win we won't and some that we just hope for a draw we will win.

I was on Twitter the other day and one of those ""promoted tweets"" (read: adverts) came up, it was from Liz Kendall. Now I'm not a massive fan of her anyway but she had posted this video where she was walking around what I guess was supposed to be her office at night, with some moody lighting and music, typing up a response to a ""constituent's question"" on some Apple computer while her voice monologued the text like she was the protagonist of some movie. 

The whole thing just instantly put me off her completely, this slickly produced, Hollywood-style advert for what is just a *leadership race* is completely inappropriate, regardless of her political beliefs, or lack of considering how invisible the three other candidates have been throughout the whole thing. 

It reminds me of the way American politicians seam to act, teams of security following them everywhere they go making sure the press is at least 10 metres away and making sure absolutely no contact with the general public is possible. Giant swaths of money funding massive campaign programs and a general Hollywood polish to every aspect of it including the politician/actor themselves - this isn't what politics should be about really.

My friends finally convinced me to watch the ""new"" Who on Netflix 3 weeks ago and 3 weeks later, I powered through all 8 series. (please don't ask me where I saw series 8...) Series 1 took a LOT of effort to get through. I was like, ""what is this nonsense?"" and before I knew it, I was sucked in. Then they took the 9th Doctor away from me. I was like WTF... took me about half a series to get used to the 10th Doctor then absolutely fell in love with his version. Then they took him away... and I was like WTF... and so and so forth... same thing with his companions.

Bottom line, get through series 8. IMHO, it's really good. For me, it took all the way to the finale and Christmas Special to really get on board with the 12th Doctor and his development with Clara.

It doesn't matter whether or not the majority support a United Ireland, I imagine you're still going to have a sizable amount of Loyalists up there who will, as they put it, ""never surrender"". 

You might see the UVF or some other Loyalist paramilitary group become active again and launch a wave of attacks on the South in a effort to reverse reunification. Remember, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were launched by the UVF in response to the perception among Loyalists at the time that the Republic was getting too involved in affairs of Northern Ireland (Sunningdale Agreement). 

It might even get so bad that in a ""united"" Ireland you could see Irish troops patrolling Loyalist areas in the North to quell violence and prevent Loyalist terrorism -- sort of a reverse situation to British troops patrolling areas in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. 

People like Sinn Féin, and other parties who are very emotionally invested in a United Ireland, do not seem to dwell on this issue so much, rather they seem to brush off the possibility of such a scenario occurring. Personally, I don't think the issue should be taken that lightly. Besides the human cost, the potential conflict would stifle economic growth and investment on the island for many years.

There are a lot of places in the Valleys which are just non-viable for large job opportunities - they're basically just villages which had a colliery in the middle. Some of them don't even have proper village centres or anything, they're just a bunch of houses in the middle of nowhere.

But with the creation of a metro system these places could become proper commuter towns which are directly linked to Cardiff Central. Get London Underground style trains on the Valley Lines and I bet you could get the journey from Merthyr to Cardiff down to less then 40 minutes. Expand the network massively with new lines and stations and many other places within the valleys could benefit as well.

This could also help Cardiff as well. It has a growing population, yet instead of building on the greenbelt around Cardiff, why not encourage people to move into certain valleys towns instead?

&gt;But Alyas Karmani, an imam, youth worker and councillor in Bradford, said that while there was prejudice and discrimination against black people by some Asians in the city, largely there was a healthy co-existence between the communities, which he witnessed in the mosques.

&gt;He warned against extrapolating from one isolated incident, saying that young Pakistani men were already demonised as terrorists, groomers and gangsters without being tarred with the racism brush. “There has been this problematising of young men in Bradford in particular ever since the 2001 riots,” he said.

&gt;Karmani suggested the boy who stabbed his teacher was probably motivated by the “thug mentality”, a desire to gain respect whether on social media or in real life, which stems from a feeling of powerlessness. “It’s the powerless taking potshots against the powerless. Real racism is power, to selectively advocate for one group in preference to the other, which doesn’t apply here. Really it seems much more like what Edward Said called the clash not of civilisations but of ignorance,” he said.

&gt;This is separate from the subtle snobbery ingrained in British Asian communities as a hangover from the caste system, said Karmani. “It’s rooted in the caste system, which institutionalises racism and breeds the idea that just because you are born into a certain family you are better than others. It’s also an issue of pigmentation. To be pale still carries elevated status in many families. It’s ingrained in the Asian concept of attractivity: that black is ugly and pale is beautiful.”

*Pakistanis can't be racist, we're the real persecuted minority. It's impossible.*

I absolutely love it when people like him try and concoct these bizarre definitions of what racism is, so they can exclude themselves from criticism of racism. So transparent.

Racism is simply regarding one race as inferior or superior. The consequences of that belief can be acts of violence, or missing out on a job due to discrimination. Racism is racism, regardless of how 'privileged' or powerful the racist is, the consequences of that racism will simply differ from case to case.

This young lad apparently took the extreme step of stabbing his teacher because he was ""powerless"", using racial epithets as he stabbed him was just coincidental as well presumably.

The judge in this case wouldn't release this young lad's name, but he made a point of releasing his ethnicity as he believed it to be relevant to the motive for the attack - which was racism towards his black teacher.

It couldn't be any clearer; you have a judge daring to go near a very sensitive topic, and wanting to spark debate within the Pakistani and wider South East Asian community about race and racism, and you have people from that very group coming out and saying there is a problem with racism towards black people from some in their community.

Yet you still get absolute cretins like this imam, and councillor no less, coming out and trying to whitewash the whole issue.

""Nothing to see here. We're the victims. We can't be racist, no such thing.""

Then you get a Labour MP saying this:

&gt;Khalid Mahmood, the Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, rejected the idea that the boy who stabbed his teacher had been primarily motivated by racism. He too felt it was more about gang culture, where the N-word was used simply to signal inferiority. “That word, as well as ‘coolie’ [a derogatory word used to describe Asian labourers] is used in a derisory sense to indicate that someone is lesser than you,” he said.

&gt;Mahmood said that what he sometimes witnessed in the Asian community was not so much racism but internal snobbery, which motivated men in particular to try to stop their women from getting involved with black men or men from other castes or religions: “You see it in these men, they feel they are losing grip of their women.”

*Just snobbery, not racism.*

We went intending to scalp tickets (not a thing in London, possibly illegal) knowing nothing more than where the nearest train stop to the stadium was.

The third is a question about the persona of a secondary character. Or, it may be that my issues are a miss-interpretation of your writing style.


Reined versus reigned. Would “The Chancellor barely has them reined in...” work better here, as opposed to “’...reigned in...”?


Brax shot Theta with a staser (set to lethal mode) to force him into a regeneration. It was previously stated that using the lethal mode in older stasers prevented the regeneration cycle from initiating. It was also stated that the newer staser models were modified by adding a stun mode. No other changes in staser firing modes were discussed.

It was not indicated which staser version Brax was using. Assuming that both versions had a lethal mode capable of preventing regeneration, how did Theta start to regenerate? The change in the staser’s effect, or its lack of effect, on  regeneration is not really explained.


There are two descriptions of the Lady Chancellor's persona which I find are somewhat contradictory.

“She was a cold, lonely woman. Her shadow was thin and light, and her spidery hands clasped in front of her.” Even though this is followed by descriptions of her use of power, the first part kind of reads like a headmistress from a romance novel (sorry but I couldn't find a better way to express my take on it).

“She was a tall lady, thin and sharp and she had worn the position of Chancellor for many years, almost as many as the Lord President had worn his own, and she was accustomed to making decisions for him.” This version is more descriptive of someone who is influencing and manipulating people and politics.

Anyway, I have been following Everton since 2010. Things got better and better each year, slowly but surely, every year until last. After a thrilling fifth place finish in 2014, we sunk all the way to an abysmal 11th last season. The man we all love is Leighton Baines, an extraordinary left back who has anchored the back line for years. While it's tough to swallow, especially for American fans, Timmy Howard is well past his prime and it's common knowledge around these parts that his best days are behind him. 

Hatred for Liverpool is essential. Since I started watching Everton in 2010, the Blues have not once bested those bastards yet. We've had a couple thrilling draws, but that's the best we've been able to muster. This is the year. 

Aside from that, we'll love Lukaku like a son until he leaves us for bigger and better things. Some of us want Martinez's head, some of us still have faith in  the skipper and some of us, like me, have no idea. Tempers towards the boss have already flared after an opening day draw with newly promoted Watford.

Under Moyes we consistently had one of the best defences in the league. Shaky defending is the epitome of martinez's style, all through his Wigan days defending was the one thing that was brought under scrutiny more than anything.

I believe we were playing more direct in an attempt to appease goodison but also because we were forced to. There was absolutely no space in the midfield to play through and the Watford full backs had a great game neutralising anything coming down the wings. Then playing it long failed to make an impact because lukaku hasn't got a great first touch or is that effective in the air for a big guy and was being doubled up on by two very physical centre backs.

1.  The soul of The Doctor's TARDIS:  One of the main themes of 11's run was that the TARDIS was alive (though we already knew this).  It was really pushed.  The Doctor's Wife, River's other mother, didn't like Clara, like being called ""Sexy"", etc. etc.... and She does what she wants, with The Doctor's coaxing and not the other way around.  But with 12, the VERY first thing we see when he stops ""cooking"" in episode 2 is his VERY fine control over the TARDIS.  No running about the control panels(s), no crash landings or rocky starts.  He calmly materialized her around a woman who was inside a speeding and exploding spaceship.  Then calmly pulled a lever and moved them inside another ship.  Where was the disagreement?  Did he exorcize the TARDIS' ""soul""!?  Maybe he just read the instruction manual?  Oh, look.  There's Missy in Heaven where the dead things go, calling The Doctor her ""boyfriend"" and apologizing for his bad behaviour.  

2.  Tasha Lem:  Because it was obvious that her and The Doctor had some kind of relationship.  Even to the point where I still feel it was supposed to be River, but they changed the idea and kept the story.  I mean, really.  Who WAS ""Tasha Lem"", anyway!?

I mean it's a nice idea and everything but is really the solution of last resort. You'd need an entire overhaul of education to get all this sort of stuff in and make it worthwhile. When for far less money you could target adults with training that they're likely to remember, use properly and keep up to date.

To claim benefits in the UK you have to satisfy something called the Habitual Residence Test. This simply means showing that you have the legal right to live in the UK and that you intend to settle here for the time being. As a British citizen you already have the right to live here. As for the second part, you will be quizzed about your life in the UK and what ties you have here and back in the USA. New rules that came into effect last year mean that you cannot be considered ""habitually resident"" until you have been here for three months, so if you decide to move to the UK you're going to have to plan on not getting any means-tested benefits (jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, etc.) for that time.

I'm not an expert on immigration but I think you'd have a much easier time here if you could enter the country on a British passport, which you could also then use to demonstrate that you are a British citizen. I don't know if you can enter the country as a British citizen by using an American passport and a British birth certificate.

I'm afraid I don't know much about emergency homeless accommodation. I assume it works in England the way it does up here - the local government have offices you can go to and meet someone who will asses your needs and try and help you. You can look up the address of where to go online if you have an idea of where in the country you intend to go.

As other posters pointed out, you might get more help in /r/IWantOut or /r/ukvisa but if you have any more question I will try to help. I'm afraid I've no idea what ""insurance for trans people"" refers to.

Chelsea attacks are most effective via the counter and with Mikel on the pitch it doesn't happen. The ball is won in the middle of the pitch the majority of time. It makes it 100% more difficult to counter attack if your CDM breaks up the pace of the counter. If you pay attention during a game when Mikel is in, when he is on the ball, youll see Hazard, Costa, Willian all make perfect runs on the counter and what does Mikel do? pass it backwards, to the side, or attempts to dribble and loses it, which slows down the play and gives the other team time to recover.

Basically, UCAS is a way to get the entire nation of A2 students processed and slotted into unis in one day.

If you're out of that loop, it becomes much more lax. Email unis asking about courses, say upfront what your grades are, ask if they'll be ok for a deferred entry in year 2016. Say that as you'll be doing this course and job, you were hoping you could get a preferential offer (where they let you in with less ucas points than the prospectus says). Sell it as ""I'll already be doing (or am already) part of the job that the qualification is training for. That helped me (I actually got EE in A2, plus ACE in ASs, but I was working at a place doing research, so I said that and my first choice with much higher requirements said yes... bargain.)

Seriously, don't stress. Tomorrow, find out what you got, check out all those jumping girls that are all over the schools. Console a few crying girls, and then know that that is one option. Then ask the crying girl if they want to get a coffee after your interview, because A) you're getting a job and they're clutching for security now they failed, and B) because even if they say no, Pssh, you ain't seeing her again.

If you want to stay at the job, then do, don't let people tell you it's not a smart choice. Uni is to get a job, if you get a job first, well that's awesome. If you get a job that lets you know what you ACTUALLY want to do, even if it isn't that job, then that's better than going to do some course your parents told you you'd like and you went along with because you didn't have a better idea.

If you decide to go to uni, have fun, it will be great.

If you decide to defer, let UCAS know ASAP because they'll help someone. Then do the job, rock it, have fun there too. Think about what you want to do. Wait for a month to make sure clearing etc is done, then start emailing courses. Don't wait TOO long, or they'll be swamped in applicants for next year. Just email them, if they say yes we'd accept you, and you want to do it, they'll sort it for you.

Mikel also has a different job requirement to Matic or Fabregas... a purely defensive one. Mourinho puts him on to slow down the pace of the game and kill off the contest. If you don't like the way he's being used then tell the best manager in the world how to win titles. Mikel does his job, no matter how one dimensional it is, and we normally end up leaving the pitch with points. Simple. 

In terms of stats Mikel has one of the highest pass completed rates in our squad and he has a surprisingly low fouls concede stat. Both are needed when you are trying to soak up opposition pressure and defend a lead. You can argue that it's easy to have a high passing accuracy since he plays short safe passes but it's irrelevant because the fact that he does those controlled plays is why he's in our squad. 

Look at the bigger picture. Mikel is used as a specially substitute mostly - he comes on makes low risk plays and helps us control possession... That's why he is a good player. If you are asking if he's better than Fabregas or Matic then no they are more rounded players but when we are 1-0 up away from home against a big team I don't give a fuck if Mikel comes on for 20 minutes because nine times out of ten we leave with points. In fact if you are in that situation there aren't many players that are safer to have on the pitch in our squad. If we are 1-0 down then there is no way Mourinho would ever substitute him on. It's redundant saying he's a crap player who deserves to be sold just because you don't find what his role is entertaining. The guy obviously has his uses.

2014 - ""half and half"" between Rodgers and the committee. The Southampton trio are clearly Rodgers' preferred signings, everyone else is committee-driven.

2015 - very Rodgers-driven. Only one signing from outside of English football, and every player fits Rodgers' playing style much more clearly than past transfers.

In fairness, Rodgers did say on day one that he wouldn't work under a DoF, and his behaviour since has stayed true to that.

null,null,FerociousSimplicity,null,null,null,"OK SCAs here goes. A little bit about me and some background before I get into things.
I'm 29 male and from the UK. Never had acne as a teenager but when I turned 20 I started to get acne on my face. About 5 years ago I started using Quinoderm (BP 5%) and it worked as simple as that. I would use BP and the moisturise my face was good. I could sweat and pretty much eat anything and be spot free most of the time.

Until 1 year ago when the UK got supply issues with BP and now I cant get hold of it. This last year has really killed my self esteem and drove my gf insane as my acne really gets to me.

With all this happening I thought it was time to try and get rid of my acne without BP. So I went to my doctors and he tried me on adapalene which didn't work. I'm the past I've tried all pills and creams and the only thing that worked was BP.

So now for what my current routine is. I'm about 15 days in and I cant tell if my face is getting better because I look every day so I figured I would take a photos everyday, in the morning after I have washed my face and shaved. I figure if my skin looks better when its the most irritated then it should be getting better in theory.

So I would like all of your opinions on what my skin looks like, if you think its, if you think I should switch anything in my routine and for general help and advice.

My current routine is:

AM

Simple Gentle Face Wash Gel

Shave - Nivea Sensitive for Me Gel shave with a Sensor Excel

Perscription Azelaic Acid

Moisturise with CeraVE PM

PM

Simple Gentle Face Wash Gel

Perscription Azelaic Acid

Moisturise with CeraVE PM

I've just started using the CeraVE for the last 2 days.

I'm finding I have a week where my skin seems to get better and then I break out again. I dont find any of the products irritating, the AA was tingling when I first used it now I dont feel anything.

My biggest upset is my skin is really oily. How can I stop this? I can feel it during the day it feels icky and I have to splash some water on my face in the middle of the day its that bad, my face gets really shiny. I've never had skin this oily not even when I was on BP. I think the oilyness started when I went on Adapalene for a few months and now I am on AA.

Could I be drying out my skin too much? It's not flaking or anything like that. Once I wash my face it feels great and refreshing and matte but give it 30 minutes and the oilyness starts. Do I need to apply even more moisturiser? I really don't know what to do.

My photos run from 4th August to today 11th. The last 3 are from this evening so you can see the difference from morning to night. Please be gentle when judging my skin, its when my eyes are closed when I take the photos because I cant stand looking at myself.

On a new or nearly new machine I would expect depreciation of at least 30% approaching 50% over the first year; the XJ6N is better I think but not much. You see both on eBay at around a year or two old fetching £2.5k or thereabouts. It's the same for most new bikes really, particularly stuff like the XJ6 which is targeted as a commuter or first big bike. Insurance for me was £296 a year, by comparison my TT600 which is a much faster bit of kit but older and less desirable is £160, and my XJ600 is £92 a year. I've had my licence since 2006.

With regards to the Triumphs, you're not going to find a new one for XJ6 money, but they are well made bikes and the twins have a heritage going back to the beginning or motorcycling; you still see bonnies from the 60s everywhere. Someone mentioned the Speed Trip as well, they are well worth looking into - and you wouldn't have to trade it in because you'd probably be hooked, you see a lot of them around! Buying second hand shouldn't be scary, I've only had one new bike, the way I see it is let someone else take the depreciation hit! If you are going to finance it, plenty of places offer finance on second-hand bikes (my local Triumph dealership does, have to stay away) and while you might not get a 0% deal it's usually that much cheaper that you save money anyway. Also the Triumphs hold their value better, you can find one of the twins for under £4k and I expect it would still be worth nearly £4k in a year or so.

This new system only one player would go out to press on the ""turn out"" situations. normally a second LFC player would run at the same time to close off the passing option. The team seemed much more in sync with their pressing. it was a team press. Against Stoke it seemed really isolated which made it seem to me that it was on purpose and not a result of a lack of team awareness or effort. Seems like BR is playing really really safe rather than risk being caught out. It was frustrating to watch because you always knew that 70% of the time, the stoke player would successfully pass to a teammate. Last season and the season before we pressed as a team and overwhelmed opposition rather than going one at a time and waiting for a mistake. 

This is way safer defensively, but for me its tough to get used to. 

edit: also frustrating because defending in this way forces us to go through a tough transition into attack. Before we'd win the ball and the players would all be close to each other because of the team press. Now when we win the ball we had to transition at a normal pace. It led to Benteke barely getting the ball and very little real chances in the first 60 min of the game. We are still better on the counter attack. we struggle to break down defenses. hopefully this will change, but if we can't figure it out soon enough then we are gonna have to depend on individual moments of magic to score.

The point is that we're reaching a stage in history and technological development where, without devising more and more contrived stratagems to keep necessities scarce, it's going to be harder and harder to convince the poor to work - that's what worries them.  It's hard to live the lifestyle of the rich if you can't find any servants.

It seems to me that the truth is to be found in the Parable of the Bees (quoted by Carson):

""It would be easier, where property is well secured, to live without money than without poor; for who would do the work? ....As they ought to be kept from starving, so they should receive nothing worth saving. If here and there one of the lowest class by uncommon industry, and pinching his belly, lifts himself above the condition he was brought up in, nobody ought to hinder him; ...but it is the interest of all rich nations, that the greatest part of the poor should almost never be idle, and yet continually spend what they get.... Those that get their living by their daily labour... have nothing to stir them up to be serviceable but their wants which it is prudence to relieve, but folly to cure....

1. If it is not required for retirement then he could consider paying off his current mortgage if he has one. This would be especially useful when heading into retirement.

Failing requiring money for either of those (which is a good thing) he has a lot of financial freedom with what he wants to do with the money. At a bare minimum the first steps would be split it between unrelated financial institutions to take advantage of the FSCS protection (£75k per institution from 01/01/2016).

Longer term? It's his money and if he doesn't need it anywhere else he could do almost anything with it. A more practical example would be moving to a bigger house or upgrading his property.

Currently, those people that sell cannabis pay no tax whatsoever on their sales, can adulterate the cannabis they sell however they like and have no incentive whatsoever to restrict their sale to just adults.

Under legalisation, legitimate sellers of cannabis can sell to people who would use it anyway, but instead of paying no tax, they'll pay tax on their sales, contributing to society, they'll be subject to regulation, ensuring at least a base standard of quality and accountability for their product and the police will have much more time to follow up other crimes, putting far less strain on their budget.

Under legalisation, less money will go into the hands of drug cartels, there will be an incentive to not sell to kids (threat of prosecution of selling to kids vs. legal selling to adults, rather than it all being illegal anyway), there will be a boost in tax and jobs created, fewer people in prison for drug offences, more time for the police to focus on serious crime and more liberty for the average adult to choose what they do with their free time.

null,null,shoestringcycle,null,null,null,"I'm saying that nearly all cyclists focus on riding safely nearly all the time, and unfortunately drivers forget the highway code and other good practise and assume cyclists are breaking rules or law or being unsafe when they're not.

I mean have you ever asked a cyclist why they do ""some thing that drivers see as stupid"" to find out why, it's usually not : such as riding centrally, not indicating, filtering, getting in front.

""They filter at traffic lights to ensure the get back into as dangerous as possible a position"" yeah that's right, obviously they're suicidal.. that's totally the logical assumption to make.

Actually ""in the way"" happens to be ""in sight"" and prevents drivers doing stupid things as they're relucant to drive into even soft squidgy humans directly in front.. but happy to squeeze past or disregard or squeeze into the kerb if they think they can get away with it.

Being stuck in a queue isn't just a patience thing, for a cyclist it's a very dangerous place to be:
* if you're to the side, you have a bunch of cars going past very close, and accelerating, watching the lights and the traffic in front, leaving you stranded and vulnerable just as you're moving off, when you have the least balance.
* If you're in the queue in the lane itself, you'll find that drivers will accelerate around or into you as they're looking at beating the light, or just tunnel vision focused on the cars moving away at the front of the queue.

In short, it's a horribly intimidating and dangerous place to be - moving to the front avoids this, puts you in vision at the front of the queue, and means that people pass you while concentrating on YOU rather than the lights, queue, junction, etc. This is why you have Advanced Stop Lines, it's also why you have riders jump some red lights, it's safer to cross carefully while there's no traffic at the junction, than to be mixed up with a bunch of motor vehicles that aren't looking for/at you.

Are you nose and chin issues definitely true blackheads and not [sebaceous filaments] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/)? Do not extract SFs they come right back. Many find a variation on the oil cleansing method helpful.

Aqueous cream is [NOT recommended by experts] (http://www.medicinesresources.nhs.uk/GetDocument.aspx?pageId=795103) as a leave on, nor as a cleanser in many skin conditions. It has 1% SLS and several studies suggest aqueous cream damages the skin barrier. It is also a penetration enhancer so may have adverse effects when used with irritating prescription topicals. [The results of the first study are summarised below] (http://www.eczema.org/aqeous)

*""In 2010, the results of a study carried out by Professor Richard Guy and his team at the University of Bath were published in the British Journal of Dermatology. In this admittedly small study, volunteers who do not have eczema applied aqueous cream to their arm twice a day, leaving it on for 10 minutes, for 4 weeks.*

*Overall the areas that had been ‘treated’ were 12% thinner than the untreated areas. There was also an average 20% increase in water loss through the thinner ‘treated’ areas. This research also pinpoints one ingredient in aqueous cream as doing the damage - sodium lauryl sulfate, a harsh surfactant that truly has no place in a cream meant to treat eczema.*

*Prof. Guy has confirmed to us: ‘Aqueous cream contains 1% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and this is the ingredient, we believe, that causes damage to the skin barrier.""*

Which Simple gel? Skin needs to be cleansed every night to remove the dirt of the day, sebum, bacteria and sunscreen - piling BP over skin that has not been cleansed is unlikely to be effective.

[Foaming products] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2kvqjp/what_effect_do_cleanser_ingredients_have_on_our/) are not the best for reactive and irritated skin, non foaming cleansers are preferable. Quitting almost all foaming products head to toe (esp. those with harsh olefin sulfonates/ sulphates) was the single best thing I have ever done for my skin.

Your topicals are all pretty harsh, given your skin is red, flaky and inflamed I don't think you need anything with more kick at all, but rather actives that support barrier repair and are anti inflammatory. BP is a horrible medication, it decimates the normal skin flora and is very drying. You don't say which retinoid, but tretinoin is harsh, adapalene much gentler.

Without more information about your other skin/ health issues it is difficult to suggest the way forwards. In general oral antibiotics ARE the next step after prescription topicals, unfortunately the only other prescription options are basically hormonal contraception or oral isotretinoin (Roaccutane) both of which are likely to impact significantly on your other health issues.

Whether a low dose oral antibiotic would work for you I don't know - at the levels used in rosacea, for example, they act as anti inflammatories NOT as antibiotics so don't affect digestive health in the same way.

My last thought is to review your diet and lifestyle choices, ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations. Really think about balance, variety, nutrient dense foods, low glycaemic index, anti inflammatory. Do check out /r/skindietandnutrition/

If you have digestive issues like Irritable Bowel Syndrome or diagnosed food allergies/ intolerances you might ask for a referral to a registered dietician, and ask whether freeze dried probiotics are right for you. With sunscreen ensure you are eating plenty of oily fish for the vitamin D and long chain omega-3s, experts advocate up to four servings a week.",null,0,null,1439374204,null,null,1439375008,0,cu07vmv,null,t3_3gpc8x,null,null,null,t3_3gpc8x,null,null,null,1440431805,null,6,null,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,6,null

You'd need to show evidence that smoking weed *causes* people to turn into Chavs, rather than simply that Chavs are attracted to smoking weed. Low-income people tend to use legal and illegal drugs more anyway, maybe this is just part of that.

Perhaps one of the main attractions for 'nob heads' to smoke it is precisely because it is illegal, it's rebellious. If it were legalised, it wouldn't be as attractive to them. 

Perhaps purchasing cannabis illegally brings people into contact with criminals and starts a downward spiral for them by association.
Perhaps if they were to purchase it legally, from a shop, it would have no more 'chavicising' effect than alcohol or tobacco for the average person.

A proportion of those Chavs probably have some hand in selling cannabis. If you were to legalise it, they'd be undercut by legitimate legal suppliers, forcing them out of business, or turn them into legitimate tax-paying suppliers themselves.",null,0,null,1439374217,null,null,false,0,cu07vr4,null,t3_3glqo8,null,null,null,t1_cu07ohh,null,null,null,1440431806,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

&gt; 'lacking cultural upbringing'- have you considered it may be down to yourself, and not the children of others, to provide cultural upbringing to your children?

How do I control that while they are in school. Do you understand how children develop?

&gt;'being held back'- There are children at the top and bottom of all classes across the UK. Education is for the masses, not just your kids.

With your level of thought we would not have the society we have now. You imply that the best and brightest should be left with the same dim bulbs as the rest.

&gt;'threatened to behead me'- Why on earth are you posting about such a threat on Reddit and not informing police? It's clearly not serious if the internet is where you talk about it. Are you also forgetting when non-immigrants threatened you? Stop making it sound like it's always immigrants who do these things, please.

I firmly believe the police would ask him, he would deny it and it could make matters worse. 

&gt;'palestine flag'- In this case shouldn't we be scared whenever there are Irish flags abound during the Six Nations. I don't see how being proud of your national identity is a crime, or means you aren't safe.

This is less of an issue for me, but it is a massive indicator, they also have zero contact with others except the muslim neighbours.

&gt;'dirty looks'- an English, white shopkeeper could do the same too. :)

Could, but never has at least not in a 'what the fuck is a white cunt like you doing in here' kind of way.

&gt;'many, many more reasons' most of which are probably twisting things to sound as if immigrants are the most horrible people in the world, when in fact the rest of the population are just as bad.

That's far from true. Other cultures are significantly inferior in a plethora of ways. Pakistan and India vs Rape as just one example.

null,null,grodecki,,Accountant,null,"I think I've written about this before on here in reference to someone taking a student loan whilst on a placement year.

This is an incredibly difficult question to answer definitively, as it depends very much on your circumstances. The interest rates are not as favourable on the new loans, which would initially put me off suggesting taking them, however the repayment terms are very, very generous and will not significantly impact you, as it will come off a paycheque as a percentage before you even see the money in your bank account.

As such, the only impact of taking the loan is that you will be paying 9% of your wages above 21k for a certain period of time longer. This depends very much on your wage post graduation....  again a factor we cannot really quantify exactly. This is regardless, not a major impact and it won't significantly impair your life in any way, nor hit your credit rating etc.  

What I believe to be the decider here is what the 'opportunity value' of the money is. You have a chance to get £5.5k a year, so £16.5k, with absolutely no payments right now, and a set of payments which would be miles, miles less than any loan will ever be, over a longer period, with no penalties, nor any hit on your credit rating or your ability to get a mortgage. 

If you were sensible with this money and did not spend it, could £16.5k change your life in 3 years time? Could it enable you to get on the property ladder much more quickly if that is what you want to do? In a lot of cases, the answer to that question is YES, and thus why I would advocate taking it. You have a chance to get £16.5k towards a deposit with pretty much no consequences bar a small monthly payment that you will already be making due to your tuition loan. 

Whether this is a big YES for you depends on where you plan to be post graudation; obviously £16.5k is going to get you fuck all in London. It also depends on your personal situation in a lot of ways, for example, you clearly have relatively well off parents (not a dig, just a statement if they can support you that way!), so, would they be helping you out buying a house? Would they rather gift you £16.5k than have you saddled with repayemnts for the next X years (up to 30, dependant on your wage) in order to get you onto the property ladder? I have no idea!

What I can say is that if I were in your situation and I was able to have the support of my folks thorugh university, but I wouldn't be getting anything towards a house after it, I'd be taking that loan and investing it ASAP in order to have a big boost towards my deposit as soon as I come out of uni. I'm not one of the crazy 'I need a house' types and I wouldn't be buying right now regardless as I'm in London, but it's a huge boost as it's a big injection of capital now for little tangible impact further down the line. Money now is worth more than money in the future.

P.S. Ignore everyone who tells you that the student loan makes a difference to your mortgage application, it doesn't; yes they look at affordability but they look at affordability based on your net wage, which already has any loan repayments taken off. There's a hellish amount of misinformation about regarding that.",null,0,null,1439374963,null,null,false,0,cu082ck,null,t3_3gpdow,null,null,null,t3_3gpdow,null,null,null,1440431893,null,13,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,13,null

Since the crash the figures show the employment rate for those aged 16-17 and 18-24 are down. Those aged 25-34 have stayed roughly the same. and that the groups to be in increased employment are those aged 35-49, 50-64 and 65 and over. 

The average decrease comes about because of the increasing percentage of those in the 65 and above category who are making up an increasing part of the population. The employment rate for this group is comparatively low compared to the rest so the average goes down.

After being burned by transfers under kenny, it'll be sometime before they let any one man have total control of transfers at liverpool.


So if doesn't get players that he wants, he won't adapt to what he has and play them?


&gt;If players praise the manager they are being diplomatic, if they shit on him they are absolutely right? And not spinning the narrative to suit themselves? 

Looking at the morale of players at the end of last season, I am leaning more towards what I had stated earlier.

&gt;And ofcourse all the blame lies with Rodgers. Gerrard slipping..."" 


We didn't need to win that game, we needed a draw but hey the manager wanted the players to attack.

&gt;in a crunch game in title race, absolutely disgusting performance against crystal palace where we lost a 3 goal lead in 10 min,

Yes, we were leading and they scored 2 goals before the third one. How many goals do we have to gift before we get more players defending and trying to keep possession? We already had a healthy lead and he didn't change/adapt to the situation and thus we lost the 3 goal lead.

&gt;performances in fa cup against Aston Villa and championship teams last year

Don't remember this game and I am not going to speculate., 

&gt;Gerrard red card in a game that decided top 4 race,  

Players get carded and as I stated earlier Rodgers didn't change.

&gt;2 months of absolute horrendous performances towards end of last season, Moreno and lovren's brain farts that cost us 5-6 games, mignolet was so shit he couldn't even pass to full backs lucky for us his wife intervened.

Same applies here when he did not change or adapt to the situation. 

&gt;But hey its all Rodgers fault. I'm not saying Rodgers didn't make mistakes but lets not forget there were a lot of things that went wrong last season and before that.

No, I am not blaming for everything but sure as heck he needs to be able learn and adapt.
If he doesn't get players who are good enough to play the style he wants, why not play the style which would suit the players.




&gt;Let's back him until he is here, he will probably be gone by December if we things don't pan out anyway.

While reading about his personal difficulties, I hope that he stays with us and performs but he has to step up some day and get the best out of the players in the situation he ends up in.

Well whatever has happened has happened.
I hope we do better this season.

&gt;How do I control that while they are in school. Do you understand how children develop?

Yes, funnily enough. I've just finished my A-Levels. (Cue the 'you're too young and don't know anything!' posts, guys.) There's much more to children's upbringing than the education system. That includes the parent's input.

&gt;With your level of thought we would not have the society we have now. You imply that the best and brightest should be left with the same dim bulbs as the rest.

That's not what I implied at all. The education system has to support everyone. Children have flourished in classes with kids of all abilities- these supposedly 'dim' children have their own strengths that they could teach your kids, even if said skills are not academic.

&gt;I firmly believe the police would ask him, he would deny it and it could make matters worse. 

Hmm. You believe that would happen? But you don't **know** it would happen. You're clearly not worried.

&gt;This is less of an issue for me, but it is a massive indicator, they also have zero contact with others except the muslim neighbours.

Why mention it then, if it's less of an issue? Have you considered the reasons for this? When in a new country, people bond with others from their home country to feel safe and supported. Their refusal to contact non-muslim neighbours is hardly different to your refusal to contact or tolerate them, I think.
 
&gt;Could, but never has at least not in a 'what the fuck is a white cunt like you doing in here' kind of way.

So you're a mind-reader now? You're sure that's what they're thinking yes? Not everything an immigrant does is recially motivated, you know.

&gt;That's far from true. Other cultures are significantly inferior in a plethora of ways. Pakistan and India vs Rape as just one example.

Ugh. 'Significantly inferior.' What a horrible phrase. Cultures develop at different rates. Your frame of mind is how cultures became oppressed in the first place.

&gt;Now, if you want to come back with some proper arguments to support your viewpoint I will continue, other than that i'm done with your posts.

Well, there you go. No doubt you'll dismiss everything I say as twaddle, but it's nonetheless been a pleasure to listen to your drivel. 'I'm done with your posts' sums up the fact you are not tolerant of anyone, or even willing to listen. :)

Their primary role is as playmakers and distributors. Mascherano or maybe Makalele are the archetypal defensive midfielders. Their primary role is to break up play, win the ball, and pass to someone like Kroos, Pirlo or Alonso who can then create an attack. 

 Not all deep lying midfielders are defensive midfielders, but all defensive midfielders are deep lying. 

 The very you cite about Pirlo describes him as a *regista*. This is not the same as a DM. They operate in the same area of the field but play completely different roles which require a different set of skills. The article then goes on to point out that Pirlo is only moderately involved in the defensive side of the game, and they back this up with stats. The whole point of the article is that Pirlo's primary role is as a playmaker, not as a defensive force.

 The article you cite about Kroos merely mentions that he is playing a more defensive role at Madrid than he did at Munich, and arguably being less effective in it.

null,null,grodecki,,Accountant,null,"If you won't get anything towards a house from your parents, £16.5k will make a significant difference to you getting a house at some point in your life. Saving £16.5k on graduate wages, unless your living at home, will take 5 years minimum realistically, and if you had taken that 16.5k and then saved another 5 years, you would now have £33k to put towards a deposit. And your cost would've been 9% of your wages over for that 5 years... which is an awful lot less than £16.5k! 

There is a VERY big benefit to it if you plan to buy a house within I'd say roughly 10 years of leaving university. I can't do the sums exactly as I can't predict your wages, nor where you plan to live, or anything, which obviously you cannot do either!

There is no clear cut answer and I can appreciate that explaining the long term benefits of saddling yourself with debt to parents who will not fully understand the loan system in all likelyhood (generalisation, but one that is surprisingly accurate; I'd say most of the country doesn't understand the loan system), would be challenging.

You've made 'fair' points. I'll play.

&gt;Yes, funnily enough. I've just finished my A-Levels. (Cue the 'you're too young and don't know anything!' posts, guys.) There's much more to children's upbringing than the education system. That includes the parent's input.

Since you brought it up, the brain doesn't finish developing until later in life. You also have no idea of priorities. You are at a good age, don't waste all your youth on the internet.

&gt;That's not what I implied at all. The education system has to support everyone. Children have flourished in classes with kids of all abilities- these supposedly 'dim' children have their own strengths that they could teach your kids, even if said skills are not academic.

That is exactly what was implied and what happens. Teachers are given targets, once those targets are met with one child (or group of) they are abandoned while the rest catch up. It holds the brightest back you cannot possibly post a serious arguement that it doesn't.

&gt;Hmm. You believe that would happen? But you don't know it would happen. You're clearly not worried.

I'm not so worried because I can handle myself and if I couldn't others would ensure he was dealt with. I would prefer not to involve the police because I don't want to create a situation that might otherwise pass.

&gt;When in a new country people bond with others from their home country to feel safe and supported

Across the board I expect.

&gt;refusal to contact or tolerate them, I think.

refusal? They don't give me time of day.

&gt;So you're a mind-reader now? You're sure that's what they're thinking yes? Not everything an immigrant does is recially motivated, you know.

You know that body language speaks words that don't even exist? You can tell the cognition behind the look somebody gives and the posture they hold.

&gt;Ugh. 'Significantly inferior.' What a horrible phrase. Cultures develop at different rates. Your frame of mind is how cultures became oppressed in the first place.

Well, yes and no - they scrapped having a single ""football overlord"", but sold Rodgers on a committee system which I bet he'd be less accepting of in hindsight.

It's taken 3 seasons for the committee-manager relationship to become aligned with Rodgers' initial desire. It's only now that FSG have *really* dropped the DoF model.

But yeah, it's not a huge surprise that FSG backed him this off-season. They've always maintained they're playing a longer-term game; certainly more long-term than the fanbase as a whole.

This is also why Lucas won't be getting game time (even though I love him). It's clear that Rodgers wanted one of his double pivot to also play between the forward lines and the anchor role, and Lucas does not have the mobility to do that. We are not in the market for a ""true DM"" (i.e. somebody who only destroy and protect the back 4) because Rodgers' system do not play like that -- not in his 3 years here nor when he was at Swansea.

I also stand by my assertion that this system won't work well because it is too complicated and too slow -- we basically have only 4.5 men in the forward areas instead of 5 men in a true 4-1-2-3 (the formation we played after we subbed in Can for Lallana).  

edit : I should add that Lucas will fit well in the single pivot role, which is why I don't want him sold. Can is great in that role when we are trying to win because he also do some box-to-box giving us 6 men ahead instead of 5 sometimes, but Lucas is better all round especially if we are under pressure.

Cutting up the car at the front of the queue is outright dangerous.

Assuming the driver of the front car was reasonably attentive and was just on the bite point of pulling away (before hitting the brakes when he saw the biker cut him up), then the biker caused the motorist to take evasive action.

Causing another motorist to take evasive action is a major fault on a driving test and an instant fail. Most of the ""majors"" on the test equate to something that would constitute an offence. Not sure what this equates to, but it's going to either be ""Driving without due care and attention"", or the more serious charge of outright ""Dangerous Driving"".

There undoubtedly has been a change. Namely that we have an aging population.

I wanted to stop short of giving a full statement on the health of the economy and to let others spin their own narratives onto the figures. 

On a side note - I do wonder if the reduced levels of employment for those aged 16-24 have anything to do with the ongoing productivity crisis. And also if this low level of youth-employment represents a real time-bomb with the aging population and the housing bubble etc.

&gt;Since you brought it up, the brain doesn't finish developing until later in life. You also have no idea of priorities. You are at a good age, don't waste all your youth on the internet.

This is the time where I bring up the fact that I've never used Reddit before today. I may not be a fully developed adult yet, but it also seems like you need to develop too.

&gt;That is exactly what was implied and what happens. Teachers are given targets, once those targets are met with one child (or group of) they are abandoned while the rest catch up. It holds the brightest back you cannot possibly post a serious arguement that it doesn't.

Well, I've been trying to not use myself as an example, but I'm a straight A student, and I know many others. We haven't been held back despite the number of times we should have been due to 'dim' students according to you.

&gt;I'm not so worried because I can handle myself and if I couldn't others would ensure he was dealt with. I would prefer not to involve the police because I don't want to create a situation that might otherwise pass.

That's fair enough. I'll leave it there.

&gt;refusal? They don't give me time of day.
...and it seems you don't give them time of day judging by this thread. Maybe things would work out better if you tried?

&gt;You know that body language speaks words that don't even exist? You can tell the cognition behind the look somebody gives and the posture they hold.

Yes, I'm aware of body language. I also know that people's conclusions from body language can be influenced by their own beliefs. I am not saying that the shopkeeper doesn't hate you for definite, but the idea that he does hate you just because you're white is a little far-fetched.

&gt;What's horrible about it? A backward culture is inferior to ours and I'm quite proud to say so. In a globalised world only one culture will win out. Would you prefer ours or theirs? 

Instead of being proud to say something is inferior, you should be helping these cultures out, developing them. Otherwise nothing will change, and you'll still be sat here posting about immigrants destroying your life (which they aren't!) I'd prefer that neither culture wins out.

Anyway, that's probably as far as I'll take this conversation. Thank you for at least replying- and honestly, I am sorry if I caused you offence. I just want you to know there are other opinions with just as much credibility as yours around.

The downside of course is that very few people like getting their hands dirty and community-orientated things are hard to fill spots for. It's something I've been looking at, though.

If you're buying second hand, remember you'll lose a lot less. but to work out you need to find a representative bike. If you were going to get a 14 and sell in 2016, you should look for a 12 or 13 selling today with the right sort of mileage. You should consider a slightly older one around that money, all you will be paying for it a number plate, the engine is bombproof and the design has come from the original XJ, they are legendary for reliability, and mine was really well put together. 

Harley... Well... You'll be disappointed with the 750, the 886 was also disappointing. In my opinion the only thing they ever did right was tune up those big lazy lumps and put them into Buells, a company which they then tanked. If you want something like that, look at the 1200 Sportster. On the up side, they are cheap to insure, very economical fuel wise and the 1200 almost has enough power to keep up with an actual motorcycle On the down side, my foot got caught underneath the gear shifter and I nearly put it down the road more than once, it's louder than hell, they are made of cheese, and the vibrations will give you whitefinger faster than a chainsaw. 

Edit: Just wanted to add, that 1200 makes about as much power as a chainsaw too. 61hp from 1200cc? That's the same as my divvy at 63, and a little more than half of the TT at 108 with twice the displacement. They're all blow and no go! Noisy hairdryers. Also they handle like a shopping trolley.

As does everybody, development never ends unless you choose to end it. 

&gt;Well, I've been trying to not use myself as an example, but I'm a straight A student, and I know many others. We haven't been held back despite the number of times we should have been due to 'dim' students according to you.

This is the crux of the problem. You are held back and don't know it, by schooling in general I would say if you still speak to your teachers, or have opportunity to, ask them regarding what I said about targets and see what they tell you.

&gt;Instead of being proud to say something is inferior, you should be helping these cultures out, developing them. Otherwise nothing will change, and you'll still be sat here posting about immigrants destroying your life (which they aren't!) I'd prefer that neither culture wins out.

Help how? We send foreign aid, have tens of millions of them here (europe). Like all things, change has to come from within. Our voice has no real weight because we are foreign to them.

&gt;Anyway, that's probably as far as I'll take this conversation. Thank you for at least replying- and honestly, I am sorry if I caused you offence. I just want you to know there are other opinions with just as much credibility as yours around.

Nobody can truly offend me. But opening discussion on issues without them being shut down is urgently required.

Despite your distrust and concerns about your perceived violence of Middle Eastern immigrants, you'll still send your kids to school with their children for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. All because you have ""hope""? I'm sorry, pal. That doesn't make sense to me.

I understand it must be frustrating from your point of view that you think no one is willing to engage in debate with you. However, very few people want to engage with someone they perceive to be stubbornly ignorant and that will cherrypick statistics and not listen to recourse, so it's easier to dismiss you as a bigot. 

However, make no mistake about it, you ARE a bigot. You are islamophobic and xenophobic by their definitions (as you have admitted in this thread that you are afraid of the influence of Middle Eastern nationals on your family, in your community, and throughout the UK).

It turns out that I was wrong about switching from population to registered voters; the UK already uses the latter. There is, however, quite a lot of criticism of that, and the 2011 changes (delayed by the Lib Dems until 2018) were seen as a good opportunity to fix it.

                            + He developed decent ability last year to get his head up and pick the right pass.

                            + He has no fear from what ive seen and doesnt let a strong tackle or a few    unsuccessful attacks stop him from absolutely trying to rinse his opponent on the next attack.



                            + Played a blinder and scored in a big game vs 2nd placed eventual champions    PSG when Lyon were top. Didnt miss a game after that.

                            - Sometimes his lack of fear leaves him doing things he shouldnt be doing - like    trying to take on 3 or 4 players at once

You don't have to buy it, it is what it is. As I have said before, some of the families here are ok by me. Though it is reaching a point where concern is growing.

&gt;I understand it must be frustrating from your point of view that you think no one is willing to engage in debate with you. However, very few people want to engage with someone they perceive to be stubbornly ignorant and that will cherrypick statistics and not listen to recourse, so it's easier to dismiss you as a bigot. 

Statistics are cherry picked and abused by everyone. Some, though are so damning that they have no recourse. And when raised for discussion are rapidly silenced. That isn't right, nor helpful. Also a lot of these people have been trained to immediately dismiss as a bigot etc.. anybody who voices an opinion that doesn't ring the right bell because they know the discussion will open a can of worms that cannot be put back.


&gt;However, make no mistake about it, you ARE a bigot. You are islamophobic and xenophobic by their definitions (as you have admitted in this thread that you are afraid of the influence of Middle Eastern nationals on your family, in your community, and throughout the UK).

E.g. (I'm just taking these from our past papers)

* (w/ passage) Explore the way in which Chinua Achebe makes this incident such a moving and significant moment in the novel. Support your ideas with details from the text.

* (w/o passage) To what extent is Obi Okokwo's fate a result of weakness of character or that of a person who finds himself at the crossroads of culture and change. Support your ideas with details from the text.

* (w/ passage) How does Eliot make this such a dramatic moment in the novel? Support your ideas with details from the text.

* (w/o passage) How far does Eliot make it possible to have sympathy for Godfrey? Support your ideas with details from the text.

Basically you can't really prepare other than by knowing the book really well. If you know what board for IGCSE you're doing, look up the specification/coursework and past papers.

The responsibility of essential services to ensure that a minimum level of service is provided is also a legal fact however. 

OP may go a step too far in what they want and step into territory which just isn't reasonable or possible, but that doesn't stop me wanting the Tube to become an essential service with restrictions on how they strike, just as I feel that essential public services require a better form of negotiating power than striking, hence my discussion elsewhere about creating a binding mediation body consisting of the people that use (and pay for) those services.

It said free delivery but when I went through to checkout and entered my postcode they said it was only free to mainland UK. That just pissed me off. So I paid £6.99 for delivery in which it had to be shipped 300miles over a sea but they couldn't deliver it to me when I was hardly even 60 miles away from the Irish warehouse. It would have been a lot more efficient. I'll give you a reason on why it is logical, NI costs the UK government millions, if they had a chance to leave it behind they would, we are just trouble for them, sure we contribute quite a bit but we are still kind of more of a liability than helpful to them. And in all honesty, leave all your beliefs and positions behind, nationalist or unionist, one island for one country is obviously more logical and easier to do. Don't just downvote me because you consider yourself British. I don't want to leave the UK. Believe it or not, I am actually more Unionist and prefer to be apart of the UK but I am just saying that in the future it is quite likely to happen.

Before moving into our new house, we contacted talk talk to enquire about phone and broadband. Was told there was no line in the property and it would cost £150 to have a new one installed.

Contacted estate agents to find out if this was true. Was told no and the owner had a talk talk line so back to talk talk who insisted no line in property so left it at that.

Moved in a couple of weeks later, plugged in phone and yes, we had a working phone line. Called talk talk only to be told the same again, told them we we're phoning from the property so maybe their records were incorrect.

After that they apologised and said they could have us on phone and broadband within a week and a new router would be sent to us. They'd just need my bank details to set up the DD which i gave them.

A week later, no equipment, so phone talk talk who repeat the mantra that no line exists in the property. They then claim to have no record of our order.

After much arguing and being put through to a supervisor was told there must have been a mistake and the order hadn't gone through. Unfortunately the old line had since been deactivated and it would cost us £150 for a new one.

Told them no thanks at which point they started trying to offer a free mobile account as well. Again declined and said we'd go with BT.

2 weeks later, i find a DD to talk talk has been set up on my account which i very quickly cancelled.

Ecuador have been preventing access though, and have demanded that Sweden grant Assange asylum status which the Government cannot do (due to the way that asylum status is granted in Sweden). Apparently a solution is close to being agreed, which is timely considering the statute of limitation for three of the four allegations runs out next Tuesday. 

Also, just to add, the nature of the requested interview with Assange and the interviews covered by the freedom of information request are very different. The interview with Assange is with a view to arresting and charging him, which requires him to be able to submit to Swedish custody immediately after the interview. The interviews in the FOI are by way of Mutual Legal Assistance and cover both suspects and witnesses, normally at an earlier stage of proceedings where all that is needed is information to help an investigation (not an arrest).

Making a team gel is not always as speedy a process as it was last season and I think people are maybe being too critical too early. Of course everyone is entitled to their own opinions but some of the posts on here recently have not been analytical really they have more been knee jerk reactions. I was simply trying to share a more optimistic opinion because as a life long fan of 22 years I can say that there has never been a better time to be a saints fan and I feel like this should not be forgotten. I didn't realise stekky had so little time in prem I thought he was with Fulham for a few seasons but obviously I'm wrong. I think that he may be around longer than you think because we don't know what Forster will be like when he's back from injury. Looking at Jrod being match fit by no means dictates you are your former self so perhaps even when Fraser returns there will be some decent competition for starting GK. Final thought; I've always loved the support saints have, it is patient and understanding. I have rarely if ever heard our fans boo our own players perhaps maybe fox a few seasons back. But regardless my point is that as expectations increase from supporters so too does the level of criticism towards players. I would hate to think we would turninto a load of gunners fans who spent more time booing than cheering haha.

Certainly comfortable (6'3"" here) and easy to ride. Not too powerful at all for a beginner - I think it comes in at something like 95bhp(?) so similar to a lot of i4 bikes (Fazer, Hornet, Bandit etc) The spread of torque is nice and it'll pull in any gear - better than the aforementioned.

For me, the major downside were the brakes - 2pot callipers on a 21st Century bike is just a bit shit. Even my old FZ6 had 4 piston dual callipers. I don't know if that's something they've changed on the update, though.

I also wasn't blown away by the steering. I found the skinny rear tyre didn't give me as much confidence as I'd like, and it's just not as sharp as something sportier. You also don't have the same choice of tyres on an adv as a bike with standard tyres. 

Added to that, I'd also be honest with yourself about how much greenlaning/off-roading you're going to do; as with the 21"" front and even more limited choice of tyres, you're making a compromise on road. I'd say if you're not doing at least 40% off-road take a look at the XR (Trail tyres are 60/40 on off split, so seems reasonable). Same bike, same engine, slightly tweaked suspension and a 19"" front for better handling characteristics. Also: tubeless tyres. You're the only person who knows how much you're going to be off-road. I took my FZ6 down some pretty shady semi-off road tracks in Wales (barely paved) and it was fine. If I was doing a lot of off-road, I'd prefer to having something like a 450 enduro as it's going to be lighter to pick out of the mud (and makes better braaaaps).

I found the stock screen caused a lot of buffeting, so that's something you might want to look into changing as a tall guy - like the crash bars it's something you might need to budget for.",null,0,null,1439383027,null,null,false,0,cu0ajcg,null,t3_3gp4kv,null,null,null,t3_3gp4kv,null,null,null,1440433057,null,2,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2,null

You realize that the police are actually statistically proven to stop and search black people more, right? I mean, that's genuine actual proof there.

Re: Muslims -- that may be true, I have no position on that -- but are immigrants disproportionately Muslim? That seems unlikely since the bulk of UK immigrants are from Europe, not known as a bastion of radical Islam. And if Muslims are that way, then surely the figures for **British** Muslims should be disproportionately high. Are they? I think the onus is on you to prove that, having made the claim in the first place.

&gt; They don't just do that though, they commit crimes against the ethnic population too. In massive number.

You're missing the point: you want to say that immigrants are making the numbers worse, which means you have to compare to a situation in which the immigrants aren't there. That means you have to discount any internal violence in that population.

&gt; If they are living a life of slavery, how do they report rape? Let's not touch on grooming eh?

This sentence confuses me. How do we know about trafficked rape at all? Because the police investigate it, it's not (all) self-reported. Re: grooming -- yes, there was the massive investigation in Rotherham but do we know that non-British or Muslims are disproportionately committing grooming offences? I have no idea, come back with some data.

As strong, openly unionist parties (the full name of the Conservatives is the Conservative and *Unionist* Party after all) they are arguably just as nationalist as the SNP. Look at the way the union flag is incorporated into their branding and campaign material for example.

This appears to be amplified in Scotland with all three UK-wide parties, especially Labour, taking a strongly unionist approach towards *everything* they do, it seams like they would prefer a Conservative Scottish Government then a SNP Scottish Government over there.

In Wales, *Assembly* Labour (not so much Welsh Westminister Labour) takes a small 'n' nationalist approach to government, arguing for far greater powers for the Senedd and for it too become a fully formed parliament, as well as UK wide decentralisation and federalism, although they obviously don't go as far as suggesting independence or anything like that. They also tend to be a bit more left wing then Labour-UK, arguing for a quasi-state owned welsh railway company, nationalising the airport, and generally taking a greater involvement in the Welsh economy rather then a more hands off approach.

In Northern Ireland the only really non-nationalist party is Alliance, which is specifically neutral on the question. Nationalism, whether for the British State or the Irish State is deeply embedded into the fabric of the Assembly.

null,null,AmerieHartree,,Democracy is the most revolutionary thing in the world,null,"&gt; Paul Eisen, a self-professed Holocaust denier, claims close association with Corbyn over several years and even that Corbyn has donated to his work. When confronted by the Daily Mail last week, Corbyn’s spokesman condemned Eisen’s views, but declined to comment on Eisen’s claims that Corbyn has attended “every single” one of his events and donated towards his work.

This is a rather worrying claim. However it should be noted that the events that Corbyn attended were not connected to holocaust denial, they were events of the group Deir Yassin Remembered, described by the daily mail as an anti-Israel pressure group.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; In February, the reverend Stephen Sizer, was ordered by the Church of England to stop using social media after posting an antisemitic conspiracy myth that Israel planned 9/11. While the Church said the material Sizer posted was “clearly antisemitic”, on Sunday the Mail revealed that Corbyn wrote to the Church defending Sizer, saying that he was being victimised because he “dared to speak out against Zionism”.

It's not clear whether the material that Sizer reposted on facebook was antisemitic or merely anti-Israel (putting aside the matter that it is clearly ridiculous) - the two are obviously not equivalent. I am led to believe [this is the article](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/9-11/Israel_did_it) in question, but I have not had the time to read through it to check if there is indeed any antisemitism in the article.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; In April 2012, Corbyn warmly praised Ra’ed Salah, a prolific antisemite who claims that Israel planned 9/11 and who has, according to the Court of Appeal, even promoted the antisemitic blood libel that Jews bake bread using the blood of non-Jewish children. Yet Corbyn has said “Salah’s is a voice that must be heard” and publicly told Salah: “I look forward to giving you tea on the terrace because you deserve it!”

This is also a worrying claim, and the most damaging in my view.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; In July, the Telegraph revealed that Corbyn has accepted thousands of pounds in gifts from organisations closely-related to Hamas.

The organisations in question are Interpal and the PRC (Palestinian Return Centre). The PRC has been granted NGO consultative status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and has initiated a lawsuit against the Israeli government for claims that it 'had “known links to terrorism” and was “affiliated to Hamas.”'. On Interpal, according to wikipedia:

&gt; The US government has made allegations that Interpal is funding or supporting terrorism, but these have not been substantiated in the British courts or by the Charity Commission. The British High Court in July 2010 found it is libellous to link Interpal and Hamas.",null,0,null,1439384135,null,null,1439384956,0,cu0azzj,null,t3_3gpp3q,null,null,null,t3_3gpp3q,null,null,null,1440433276,null,2,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

Now the season's officially started and they're still talking but not doing.
