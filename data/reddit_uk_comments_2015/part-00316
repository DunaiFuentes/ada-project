That said. I did enjoy him more by the end of season 5 than the start. Season 6 was however, the worst season of the new show in my opinion. 

I will also say that I am enjoying Capaldi as the 12th Doctor much more even though the show is in some ways very different than it used to be (and in others exactly the same). The show is focused on change of course some of those changes work better for some people than others. 

My advice is to let season 1-4 stand as their own era and let 5-9 do a slightly different thing. It's still better than 90% of the stuff on TV even though I prefer season 1-4.

TIL there are no economists, lawyers or specialists in the general public. There are no noble prize winners or PhD owners. The general public consists entirely of a Daily Mail reading strawman you just invented. Also, politicians are a now competent, unbiased, trustworthy group who should not be scrutinised or subject to transparency because we apparently are no longer operating under a democratic system in which figures are supposed to represent the interests of people who voted for them. Also, ""populism"" is now defined by my dumbshit fucktarded opinion being in the minority, not because it is dumbshit fucktarded, but obviously because all 503 million inhabitants of the EU are to stupid to understand it. They clearly don't understand how much of a petty reactionary cocksucker I am, that I defend opaque negotiations between multinationals and a superstate on the basis that some right wing people in the UK don't like it. And that's how I define my entire moral and political worldview, by being Not Nigel Farage. Because the vast expanse of my immaturity and idiocy can not be surpassed, not even by a bloated bureaucratic superstate 30 countries wide.

So did we see 43% of 2010 Lib Dems jump ship to UKIP? Of course not. UKIP picked up voters from each of the big 3 to different extents, but the 2010 Lib dems the big parties picked up balanced them out. That means there are a good number of ex-Lib Dems in the Labour vote.

Electoral calculus had a pop at getting some numbers, and while it's hardly a perfect reflection, it gives some good ballpark numbers, estimating that almost a quarter of 2015 Labour voters were Lib dems in 2010.

Very true. Just because the Doctor has always been male doesn't mean he always will be. So what? Where's the drama?

&gt; He simply ISN'T female and a regeneration into a female actor will be the jumping the shark of the new series.

I used to work in Stiff Kitten before it closed down.  Towards the end it dwindled out due to lack of PR and being well overdue a refurb.   Despite this before it went to shit it was an extremely busy club.  

Back to the topic of poo.  The toilets in the club had pipes on the back that where collapsable ( like tumble drier pipes), dont ask me why, they just did.  Anyway, at one point or another one of the pipes came off and we didnt notice for a good amount of time (there was an estimate of 2 weeks.)  One night the stock room beside the kitchen started flooding, but the water reaked of shit.  So we went into the bathroom to find out the problem.  This is where we found out about the pipe.  There's a cavity in the wall in clubs behind toilets so there isnt a big ass cistern sitting there, that cavity had about a foot of shit in it and it obviously had to be removed.  

That was when I had to dig 2 weeks worth of shit out of a wall with a plastic pint cup.

He had to bring Kane off, and it's not like he had a better attacking option than Lamela to bring on.  I suppose he could have brought on a CM to close shop for the day, but that's not really our way.  The Mason-Bentaleb sub is the only one he made that was questionable, since Ryan was playing well and Nabil had poor match against United -- but getting Nabil back out there after he had a bad day the previous week is actually good man-management.  No one would have rationally expected Nabil to be as awful as he was today.

null,null,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,null,"&gt;The purpose of a job centre is to make sure you are looking for jobs and not de frauding the welfare system (which would effect people who need it). 

Complete waste of resource. Focus on assisting those who need the help instead of assuming everyone is a fraudster and wasting time keeping tabs on everyone.

&gt;They provide us with resources (computers and the like) to help us look for jobs and will sometimes provide us with additional funds to go to said job interviews.

Well they removed public phones from all job centres last year, which are pretty key for a job search. Many online adverts, particularly local businesses and those advertised through recruitment agencies, require the job seeker to call to apply. I think removing resources that job seekers need to find work is not a good policy.

&gt;They sometimes... If we have zero skills... Put us on courses to get us on our own two feet. 

Except the courses are not advertised or targeted effectively enough. In my experience, if you want a relevant course you have to find one yourself (Which I did), otherwise you will end up on a back to work course where they make you do team building exercies like making a paper egg basket using safety scissors and PVA glue (Seriously i'm not kidding, job centre referred courses are a joke).

&gt;That said, they are not our mothers and will not hold our hands whilst we bemoan the lack of jobs available to us, yet turn a blind eye to jobs we ""just wont do""... Like I said, we are a statistic and the system doesn't give a shit, if we can do the job we should be taking it anyway, and if we don't.... Well then we are willfully turning down jobs and should no longer expect the system to hold our idle arses. Beggars cant be choosers and all... My two cents.

There are more people than their are jobs, there always are in this economy. The current unemployment issue is not down to people being too picky, anyone who thinks this way is naive. It only takes a couple of rejections from all the retail, fast food, call centre and cleaning jobs to realise this (i.e. jobs which are generally low paid with low job security and high turnover).

All this pales to insignificance when you realise the job centre no longer performs the primary function it was designed to do in the past. It used to act as a sort of national recruitment agency, by way of linking employers up with potential applicants and arranging interviews. You might think this would be an example of the job centre holding peoples hands, but arranging interviews on behalf of applicants both helps those who want a job and forces the hand of those who don't. It's a win-win situation, and could easily be done if the advisors didn't have to waste all of their time ticking boxes and processing sanction targets.",null,0,null,1439690210,null,null,false,0,cu4gdhk,null,t3_3h49xa,null,null,null,t1_cu4b0m9,null,null,null,1441275862,null,20,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20,null

The issue is one of cultural compatibility. If you don't believe in cultural relativism and that British customs and laws are superior to that of islamic societies, then it's obvious that the two analogies are incomparable, because islamic culture is so far removed from British culture which is mostly influenced by centuries of secularism and Christianity. The British justice system is the very antithesis of islamic jurisprudence, because it places human equality and dignity over religious dogma. 

If one is to believe in cultural relativism, then yes both cultures should be comparable, and American culture should be no less compatible than that of islamic societies. Comparing the two isn't a ridiculous attempt at mental gymanstics (Which those opposed to cultural relativism would argue), in fact it's quite logical. 


Some elements of islamic societies do not cause clashes - cuisine and art from the muslim world generally assimilate and indeed do enrich the host culture. However when it comes to the more significant issues of cultural norms, religion and indeed the very laws of the country, then there are issues with assimilation, and in some cases I would argue there is no grounds for compatibility between them.

Like you said, it's only been 2 games, but I just don't feel like Shelvey's corners and free kicks tend to be placed as well as Sigurdsson's on average - though he does do the occasional exceptional play that we've come to expect from him.

Sorry, no. Losing its cache as ""must-watch"" event television DOES matter. Otherwise they wouldn't measure it.  Since Moffat took over, it's stopped being watched by just about everyone I know that isn't a huge sci-fi fan anyway - it's really striking.

I had major problems with everything RTD did - but I can't deny he made Doctor Who relevant again in a way that I would have thought was totally impossible.

Losing these people *matters* to a BBC that has a mandate to appeal to ""the British public"" i.e. not just obsessive basement dwellers and tumblr bloggers. This is the same way the show went in the 80s (i.e. only appealing to the ""fans"") and guess what happened? No more show. Those overnights are just *sad*, and, frankly, an embarrassment no matter which way you cut it or try to deny that it matters.

BTW anyone have a comparison with overnights for other drama shows? That would be interesting to see.

That clogged the area where Arsenal like to play, but against Leicester it just created vast open spaces in the areas that Leicester like to play in. We ceded the wings to a side with very fast wingers, to a side that plays almost exclusively down the wings. And because Reece played so deep we had trouble with the high press.

It depends what they offer, like how long you want them to look after your child. It might be the only one available because it's so expensive! Ask the ones which don't have any places, how much they charge, to get an idea of cost. Also it might be worthwhile putting your child's name down on a waiting list, if they have them, on a few just in case a place becomes available, although you might have to pay some kind of administration fee.

I've heard childminders are more affordable. With them you might get a better quality of care for a child that age, but always get a OFSTED registered CM, and look for recommendations and check that their mentality on how they care for children matches your own. They might be cheaper because you can agree specific hours at an hourly rate, rather than have to pay a blanket 8-6pm or whatever time the nursery is open. 

If you don't get too much information here, the best place to ask is probably mumsnet or mumsnet.

How much are you budgeting?

Not sure where you're from, but childcare is a problem for many families, my wife didn't want to work when our kids were very young, so we still had financial pressures in a different way, but a least we knew our boy was being well looked after.

Elderly care and planning for the end of life is a bit of a disaster. It's like it's too uncomfortable to have rational conversations about.

Most people do not want to die lying in a hospital, possibly in pain, possibly losing their mind or their physical ability to look after themselves. Most people likely don't want to go to nursing homes either. But it's such an uncomfortable conversation to have. Most people wouldn't even want to talk about this stuff with their families. How many of us have had their parents clearly instruct them about their wishes once they get too old to look after themselves?

The elderly population will keep getting larger. Chronic diseases will keep going up. The cost to look after these people will keep going up. And everybody, 100% of us, will die.

As I understand it the violence of the KKK is relatively rare, and tends to be limited to targetted individuals -- targetted because of the colour of their skin.

The IRA groups on the other hand existed for one purpose and one purpose only -- to shoot people and set bombs. And when you're setting off bombs in crowded places it's inevitable that you don't know who you're going to be killing.

A better analogy than the KKK would perhaps be an organisation consisting of dozens of Timothy McVeighs. Imagine an Oklahama-style bomb attack occurring somewhere in the USA several times a year, and you'll get much more of a feel for the kind of effect the IRA had on Britain while they were active.

To (finally) answer your question -- outside of Northern Ireland the IRA are almost extinct. There's always the theoretical possibility of an attack but you're probably more likely to fall into a sinkhole in Manchester than actually get involved in an IRA attack. In some parts of NI, however, there are post-PIRA splinter groups still knocking around and they are able and willing to cause violence.

Instead of blaming the players who actually cost us the points (the same 3 players on both goals: Walker, Bentaleb, Toby), it's become the ""shit on Lamela show"" because hey, he's the one outsider on the team we dont like anyway . I mean, he came on ten minutes before Bentaleb and those ten minutes was one of our best spells of the game.

The fact is, we lost the game because Hughes made a tactical change and specifically told his players to overload down the left/our right side. Our players/manager didnt adjust to that tactical change very well. Bentaleb should have picked up on his runner (Ireland), Walker should have been less eager to get forward, and our front four as a whole should have been less eager to get forward. But trying to sholder the loss on Lamela on the basis of ""I'm tired of him"" is pointless scapegoating at its best. He JUST came in to training last week and was our only player without a pre-season, and nothing he did contributed to the points dropped. Is it Lamela's responsibility to somehow make sure Toby doesnt have an absolute shocker?

It's important you keep a copy of your request to cancel so that your bank knows what date you contacted them. The law only stipulates that you contact them to make the request, it does not specify how, the law also stipulates that the provider must have a way to contact them clearly visible 

If you paid for a years worth of stuff on the other hand rather than monthly payments it's a different story because the services are considered to have been partially rendered so you won't be able to get a refund under the same rules.

But the government doesn't need to issue debt in order to run a deficit - it can simply spend more than it raises in revenue. Why would that be a problem?

Remember, the UK government issues the currency, and cannot ever run out of it. Why on earth would it need to borrow it in order to fund expenditures?

null,null,BenAigan,null,null,null,"The best budgeting advise I can give on this is to keep a money journal, after both salaries are in you sit together and record the balances of accounts before salary, salary amounts and current balance.  Record all credit card balances, store cards etc.  Also record all savings balances.  *If you are bad with money these monthly meetings can get intense, for our future and my sanity I left most of decisions to my better half until I became more financial savvy.

Keep separate current accounts as it can be easier to budget, bill accounts can be joined if necessary.

if you don't have a credit card, get one interest free, I haven't paid interest on a credit card in over 15 years. See http://moneysavingexpert.com

Once you have all balances, pay of the expensive debt first.  Don't over pay student loans, just pay at the regular frequency, they don't get included in credit checking and the interest is low.

Top up the savings accounts with what was left in current accounts before salary, make an estimate of how much you should have left next month to see if you can do better.  You may want to move some of your current salary into savings but always have a quick and easy access method for unexpected bills.  Maybe even have a £50 a month emergency fund for car repairs etc.

As for mortgages, I have found that offset accounts work well for me, I had some money for the deposit but also had some other savings which when deposited into the offset mortgage would reduce my monthly interest payments and this also allowed instand access to my savings.  The interest costs saving in an offset mortgage is higher than any interest gains in savings and ISAs.  

Check out the Santander 123 accounts as well.

Basically record everything in the book.  Once you have this record you can start to see where money is going.  ",null,0,null,1439714113,null,null,false,0,cu4p2an,null,t3_3h4834,null,null,null,t3_3h4834,null,null,null,1441280021,null,1,null,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

https://medium.com/@AlexWhiteUK/the-non-voter-myth-9162897a7895

That article helps show some of the problems with this logic and I would add that many people don't vote simply because they can't be bothered. We assume everyone is politically engaged but a lot are not to the point where they really don't care. They don't feel disenfranchised, they haven't even thought about the concept.

null,null,Jon_Hess,null,null,null,"The narrative of our time is that everything is more socially influenced than biologically influenced, and sometimes even that biology plays no factor at all.  If you question the narrative, they'll say your claims are unsubstantiated but repeat the socialisation theory with nothing to back it up.  Questioning the narrative is taboo.  Some scientists have even been threatened by feminists groups for their work on highlighting differences between men and women.     

As you said, those a little higher up the autism scale tend to be more drawn to STEM fields in general.  Men tend to rank higher on that scale than women.  Autism has even been described as ""the extreme male brain"".  This stuff is just more common in men.  

On the social side of it, more men are seen as irredeemable losers by society for the way they look, act etc. than women.  These guys have nothing to lose by pursuing something which would lower them on the social ladder.  I've never heard of women fetishising programmers for example, the way they do with firemen or doctors.  Tell someone you work at a computer all day and many will think you're a loser (no offence, I work at a computer all day, too).    

Women have more to lose.  They have intrinsic value that men don't have.  As ugly as it sounds, I think people frame the world through the whole alpha/beta thing, no matter how much we want to deny it.  It's no secret that guys into the more nerdy stuff tend to have less genetic potential when it comes to good looks or a strong body.  In the eyes of their peers, these guys are designated ""betas"" until they can prove otherwise.  Women don't have to deal with that in the same way, so pursuing a job like programming can be seen as a step down in social standing for them.

In simple, general terms, women have to make the choice to become social outcasts where as many men are forced into that position (thankfully many of those guys also make the best of it and do very well).",null,0,null,1439716496,null,null,false,0,cu4pldj,null,t3_3h34vp,null,null,null,t1_cu3z4hx,null,null,null,1441280271,null,0,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

I really liked the goal. It looks a bit like he just fumbled it in, but the calm run out on the wing, threading the two defenders to put the ball to Stevie/Hendo, then once both of his captains had a good look at the ball Marko chases it in to the goal. Some of his dribbling can look a little aimless, but I think he looks to have good close ball control. He'll probably never get to play with Suárez, but he put a good ball or two up to Mario last season that a quicker/more determined striker would have done something with, and he's looked pretty good calmly lobbing a ball in to the box in a way that might favour Christian Benteke or even Origi if his positioning is good enough.

If we works hard enough in training, I think he could produce some magic with the Dannys/Belgians.

From my understanding if you go a bit deeper the problem arose when the stocks and shares that make up the worlds equity market entered the dot come bubble phase. Investors then looked for uncorrelated assets and hedges to cover their losses. Real estate prices then went up 70% in the USA over the next 10 years. Real estate was so captivating because they were not only uncorrelated to equities but also uncorrelated within their class. Which meant that if a house in Florida fell in value, there is no reason for that to impact house prices in New York or apartments in Chicago. Mortgage backed securities were already a safe bet, but the problem came when trying to maintain that safety while maximising returns. This was done through ""tranching the security"" which turned MBS into a contract called ""collaborated debt obligation"". This combined the mortgage payments of many different parts of real estate from many different places, in the same security, but kept it separate by selling different parts of the security to different people via tranches. This enables you to choose the risk you wish to invest in, senior tranch would be low risk low reward, mezzanine tranches would be higher risk higher reward and for those who wanted yield over everything it was the equity tranche. The whole point was to make the already uncorrelated real estate markets MEGA uncorrelated. And thus if a house in one place defaults, wiping out the equity tranch holders, the loss is isolated from the holders of the loans of another place. Safety combined with greater returns for those holding the risk. This led to an explosion of demand for these securities as housing prices nearly doubled from 97-08. CDS's were then attached, which is a sort of insurance policy you can sell on. It insures the buyers of the CDS against the default of the bond on which it was written. In return the issuer of the CDS and the writer of the insurance policy receive a regular income from the buyer, just as an insurance company receives premiums. Now this is where the problem arises, insurance companies usually rely on on things such as actuarial tables to calculate the risk they are covering, and then work out how much cash they need to have on hand to cover people cashing in their policies. But if the probability of default on an entity such as Lehman Brothers is considered extremely unlikely and as such, if you write a CDS contract on that equity, you wont have to keep much capital as no such losses are anticipated. Now the problem is the banks were running out of good borrowers to whom they could lend. The later batches of these securities were increasingly made up of ""no income, no job, no assets"" mortgages collateralized by such things as Ebay earnings, or bar tips or by purely fabricated income statements and robo-signed paperwork. Now because the mortgages coming in were of such dubious quality, the issuers of these securities didn't want to hold any of these dubious risk on their own book, and wanted them moved off book. To do this SIV's were created, these were separately created companies isolated from their parent companies balance sheet, who's sole activity was to collect the income streams from these mortgages and CDS contracts and pay them out to the different investors holding them. By 2006 those investors included small Norwegian towns, US pension funds, and German regional banks. With a AAA stamp of approval and rising prices, what could go wrong? Well an already tight credit market froze, and well the rest is history.

Fortunately I would see my dad each week and he would give me a little bit of cash to help but it wasn't easy. Eventually I dropped out owing fees and a large debt, best thing I could've done. Got a job, never looked back, never had to see my mother again.

Google flights has been good too if times and dates are flexible. I always use these in an incognito browser. Set a flight alert and you'll be notified the moment the price goes down. 

For train up from London, £40 is pretty cheap depending on the time but I think you could do better. Try Trainline.Com for those. Another option would be the national express. It takes longer but can be ridiculously cheap. Megabus even more so but the buses aren't as nice. 

As for match tickets, if you become a member and get up early (not sure on time difference) you might be able to snag a couple of tickets at face value. It's a definite 'might' though as it can be notoriously difficult to get tickets in this manner, especially for the big matches like these. I'm sure there are usually cheaper hospitality packages though too. 

For accommodation, you could rent an apartment for the week possibly. Should be cheaper than £700 between you. Try Posh Pads. Not sure on the prices but I know some mates visited from NY and stayed in one of those. 

if I wasn't emigrating to the US I'd put you up! My dad and I are thinking of coming to South Africa in January funnily enough. To watch a test match while England are on tour.

Thomas Donaghy (16) and Margaret McErlean (18), both Catholic civilians, were shot dead by the Ulster Freedom Fighters as they arrived at their workplace, Abbey Meat Packers, Glenville Road, Newtownabbey. McErlean died on 18 February 1974

 Cecil Dougherty (30) and William Corrigan (32), both Protestant civilians, were shot dead during an Ulster Volunteer Force gun attack on a workers hut, Rushpark, off Shore Road, Newtownabbey. They were assumed to have been Catholics. Corrigan died on 10 July 1994. The event took place one day before the Loughinisland massacre.

Anyway... It seems like OP has no idea what he wants to do anyway. Nowhere did he state any talents or job role he's looking for. That makes him unemployable, nobody wants to take someone on just for the sake of ""getting a job"". 

My advice would be, determine what your talents and passions are, then try to find a job role that aligns with them, and develop your skills so that in an interview for that job role, you stand out.

Unfortunately, the easiest (if one of the most expensive) ways to stand out, is a degree. But additionally, that gives your 3 or 4 years to actually decide what you want to do. I left 6th Form not knowing what I wanted to do, and it wouldn't be until middle of second year that I got an inkling, and the last semester of third year I decided.

With Career Development Loans, you can get them from two banks, the Co-Op and Barclays. You can borrow up to £10,000 from either bank, but it can only be one bank, not both. These are commercial loans with a twist, the interest is paid by the Skills Funding Agency whilst you study, when you finish studying you typically have 1-2 months grace period before you have to start repaying the loans.

If you are working prior to your masters, you can only obtain 80% of the amount for course fees, the rest has to be from expenses. I've included a link to the Money Saving Expert website [here](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/career-development-loans) which can explain far better than myself.

Like you I have a Scholarship for an MA, but I took out the loan as the Scholarship only covered my tuition fees, I needed the loan for accommodation. I took it out last year with Barclays and was accepted, but I dropped out of Uni and had to pay it back. This year I reapplied and I was rejected from Barclays and lost an appeal, but accepted by the Co-Op (whose appeals process is far more human than Barclays).

Because many feminists want rights but no responsibilities. I'll humour you with a few examples.

You might think oh this is a modern thing. It is no such thing. Consider Virginia Woolf, beacon of feminism right?  Except Virginia Woolf is a prime example of a power grabber. You see during her time women didn't vote. Most men also did not vote. Yet she was staunchly PRO-white feather movement. That is shaming men (who could not vote) into fighting other men (who also could not vote) yet not taking up a rifle and taking up the fighting themselves. When confronted she hand waved it by saying only 50-60 feathers had been pinned on men. Emmeline Pankhurst hero of suffrage right? She was a leader in the white feather movement. 

Send non voting men to fight other non voting men to fight and die so that we (women) might have the vote! If she cared so much she would have pulled a Mulan and gone off to fight. Mulan happened in China 1500 years ago. My particular minority Chinese ethnic group women have always fought alongside men.

Or consider the modern age. Women can hit, can abuse men and it is seen as completely acceptable. Or that women who make fake rape claims can utterly destroy a man's life and nothing happens to them. 

Or shit like this:

http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/women-prison-it-equality-treat-female-offenders-differently-men-1485740

I contacted my local CAB and they forwarded me on to an emergency housing project for young adults. Perhaps your area has something similar, the CAB would have a list of places but they tend to work on a referral system so you'd need to get a sympathetic CAB worker to pass you on.

If you find a friend to crash at, make yourself useful. Wash dishes, clean the toilet, be as unobtrusive as possible and keep yourself clean. If you find yourself completely stuffed and whoever you're staying with needs you to be out of the house all day then your local supermarkets disabled toilet is a place you can give yourself a whores bath and a local library is a good place to hang out for access to the computers and local papers etc.

I'm not suggesting this but I have to admit that when I got totally hungry I would follow my local milk float and pinch a pint off the doorstep of someone who had more than two delivered. Sometimes I'd score and a house would have bread and bacon delivered (always carry a lighter - bonfires are great). Probably not much chance of doing that these days though, almost no-one gets their milk delivered anymore.

You don't state your gender but I'll say it anyway. Don't let yourself get so desperate you take someone up on a stupid offer.

I met a guy and he asked me if I wanted to move in with him. It was a long way from where I was and I found out too late that I couldn't leave.

I just don't get why you've shifted him out to the left. In my eyes, he's best used in the centre, be that in defence or midfield. He can't cross the ball which means he'll never be a like-for-like Baines replacement and if I were Martinez, I would have kept Garbutt in the squad as your second left-back, then had Galloway on ice as a midfield/defence cover.

For instance, how about when someone goes in and says ""I've found myself a job, but I need a passport/DBS check/3 day training course before I can start, is there any way I can get some financial help?"" the answer should be hell yes!

By all means make it a loan, repayable within 6 months if you must, but let's stop preventing people from getting into work because we don't want to invest a hundred quid in them, when we're paying em around £150 a week including housing benefit etc.

Next, a phone line, or email contact where you can get genuine, clear, answers to questions, and feel safe about asking.  Often you can go into a Jobcentre, ask 3 advisors the same question and get 3 different answers, one of which will generally be 'I don't know'.  We need to KNOW if we're allowed to do certain things, what we can claim for, exactly what we'd be sanctioned for, etc, yet, many don't feel safe about even asking in case it draws attention to them.  No-one wants to be 'difficult' when advisors have people to sanction.

Also, if someone has GCSE English and Maths and can clearly write legibly and create their own CV - can we PLEASE stop paying private companies thousands to hold courses that are of zero value?  Let's instead spend that money on, again, small qualifications that help people into work.

Also, if someone's been rejected from a ESA assessment and forced onto JSA, they should still have their medical issues taken into consideration.  They still are not well, and likely will not be able to either do as much jobsearch as a regular person, or apply for all the same jobs.  Let's stop pretending there's no space between 'not fit for work' and 'fit for any kind of work'.

Lastly, said it before and it's not popular, at 60, how about we move people onto a 'pre-pension' at the rate of JSA, but without the demands.  They can still find work if they wish to, but given that most employers won't look twice at someone over 50, how about not harassing them quite so much?

null,null,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,null,"&gt;This poll just seems to confirm how influenced people can be by the press IMO.

As someone who is neither pro nor anti Corbyn, I agree completely. The poll says a lot about the general interest in politics of the British population and just how many of their views they're willing to buy from the newspapers. 

Allow me to rant a bit...when my grandad left school at 14 in the 1920's, life was tough and a large proportion of people joined political parties to try and change society for the better. Consequently, even a 14 year old would have strong political opinions on various subjects, which he/she could often back up through the evidence of their own struggles. 

It's just not like that nowadays. Most people just accept their lot even if they're not happy with it. And I don't believe a lot of people are happy with it either - certainly not people my age anyway - just look at the rise in mental illness that has gripped society in recent years. We're conditioned to believe that the best society is neo-liberal one even whilst we're drinking away our stresses, or going to the doctors because we're unable to cope. 

But most people haven't questioned the system yet - it's much easier to conform and accept the narrative, so even when a candidate comes a long who says 'you know what, this isn't all it's cracked up to be', the reaction is to say 'well...I think Labour would do better with David Miliband'. And what does David bloody Miliband actually stand for? Well, most people don't know. But that doesn't matter.

First of all it's overwhelmingly obvious how influenced we are by the media, it's linked to our education partly I think. People aren't encouraged or taught critical, independent or even creative thinking enough. After 2015 on question time a woman said the result was a 'victory for Murdoch' (as well as other right wing newspapers). And people were like 'how dare you, we can think for ourselves'. Yeah, like people were worried about a Labour/SNP coalition, thought Labour overspent or that Ed Miliband wasn't 'prime ministerial' themselves. 

I also couldn't agree more people just accepting things or about the rise in/acceptance or mental illness. At university for graduation those giving speeches made light of people having near breakdowns and 'thinking they wouldn't make it'. People go after you if you question the system, the media and normal people. The guy has many flaws but look at what has happened to Russell Brand, or even if you speak out yourself people go after you. On another thread someone posted about how 37% think their job is meaningless, I got too comment by pretty much saying 'we all think this but no one really questions it, we could work less easily etc', and some people starting saying 'who are you mr englightened' or 'don't you speak for me' and so on, it's bizarre.

Men in childcare are almost always accused of being sexual predators. Same with being teachers. All it takes is one accusation and their career is over. And everyone believes the accuser because of the fervent rhetoric that men are inherently a threat.

They are putting more into online viewing.

I did chemistry, materials science and earth sciences in 1st year with the intention of being a chemist. With both materials and geology, in my experience, most people don't come to Cambridge intending to study them much further than first year because they're totally new subjects for them and they don't know what they'll be like. With that being said I loved them both and picked them as my subjects for second year. Materials science is quite good as a crossover with physics and chemistry, there's a fair amount of overlap and it's a nice multi-disciplinary option with elements of engineering as well. Earth sciences would have less overlap in first year but is quite a good option if you just have a passing interest in that sort of thing. Its course is run slightly differently to other first year nat sci options in that you have multiple short practicals every week and a practical exam at the end of the year rather than assessments throughout. Earth sciences is nice in that the department is very friendly, shoutout to the amazingly helpful librarian, and you get to know some of the people on your course very well, as well as the lecturers and phD students, through the field trips. Materials science is better now in first year than it was for me (I think) because they have the shiny new department out at West Cambridge so the labs are a bit better. If you're still unsure about which one to pick when you start you can always go to lectures for both for the first week or so before you properly make your mind and I'm sure your director of studies can help as well.

I don't have debt (other than a mortgage), I will never starve, I have access to exceptional health care through the NHS and I can pretty much buy anything (reasonable) I want.

&gt;First of all it's overwhelmingly obvious how influenced we are by the media, it's linked to our education partly I think. People aren't encouraged or taught critical, independent or even creative thinking enough.

Absolutely. Our education strongly informs who we are. I was reading a book on Japanese history recently, and it touched on their education reforms in the late 1800's. Essentially, the Japanese government reformed the system to indoctrinate people in to following a set line of thinking. To quote wiki on the 'Imperial Rescript on Eduction:

&gt;The basis of the Rescript was that Japan's unique kokutai was based on a historic bond between benevolent rulers and loyal subjects, and that the fundamental purpose of education was to cultivate virtues, especially loyalty and filial piety.

&gt; The 315 character document was read aloud at all important school events, and students were required to study and memorize the text.

The upshot of this was that, 50 years later, Japan had a country of people willing to give their lives for it who believed that they were culturally superior to other races. 

I'm not suggesting that the British system is anywhere near as bad, but it goes to show the power such influence can have at an early age. The effect in British society is more subtle with statements like 'you can't win an election from the left' taking hold despite the fact that, up until Thatcher, the whole political consensus was actually leftist (in a way that would be seen as practically communist by today's establishment).

My argument isn't that a leftist policy is the right policy (I'm more pragmatic than that), it's just that ideas from the left which still have value aren't even considered. They're just immediately shot down, usually by establishment figures who are able to control the narrative. 

&gt;After 2015 on question time a woman said the result was a 'victory for Murdoch' (as well as other right wing newspapers). And people were like 'how dare you, we can think for ourselves'.

It's a very hard argument to overcome. Very few people would admit that they were uneducated on a subject, they're certainly not going to have someone tell them they're wrong on a matter of opinion. Indeed, politicians use this argument all the time, and it makes me wince when I hear it. 'Oh, I think the British people are more intelligent than that...'

&gt;At university for graduation those giving speeches made light of people having near breakdowns and 'thinking they wouldn't make it'.

Many of them won't 'make it'. The pressure doesn't disappear after university - it grows. But they'll go to the doctor to get medication, or start taking up yoga etc because they'll see themselves as the problem (after all, everyone else seems to be functioning just fine, right?).

&gt;The guy has many flaws but look at what has happened to Russell Brand, or even if you speak out yourself people go after you.

The problem with Brand is that he's an easy target. He isn't representative of society because he's too 'out there'. It's only when respectable figures start speaking out that you'll get real change.

&gt;On another thread someone posted about how 37% think their job is meaningless, I got too comment by pretty much saying 'we all think this but no one really questions it, we could work less easily etc'

Most people's jobs are 'meaningless', it's just a lot of them won't accept that analysis. Most people in Britain don't actually produce anything concrete, we work in service industries - they're hardly necessary for life. What's more, most of us don't see the fruits of our labour - the only reward we have is the pay packet. It's not conducive to job satisfaction. A craftsman or a farmer, however, can physically see the results of their work.

null,null,double-happiness,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt; I don't fancy spending my Sunday trawling through reddit to produce 'evidence' for an MRA to ignore.

First of all, I'm not an MRA, you need to update your tags. You should make it 'former feminist', 'disillusioned feminist', or 'left libertarian'. But I have never identified as an MRA and you will not find a single comment in my history where I do so. I certainly do post in /r/mensrights though, I personally find it a much more accommodating place to discuss men's issues than feminist subreddits.

In any case you claim that /r/mensrights users often post 'misogynistic stuff' yet are unable to provide a single example so I will consequently discard that claim forthwith.

&gt; This comment I made a while ago expresses my opinions on /r/mensrights.

""I think that feminists and MRAs are natural allies. [...] Both views are complementary. But people on both sides of the aisle often don't recognise that. [...] Feminists attack back by saying that you have to be a misogynist to support men's rights.""

Straight from the horse's mouth. You hit the nail right on the head, yet go and do *the exact same thing* that you criticised only 9 months ago. Person *x* feels alienated from feminism and finds support from, and common cause with others within the men's movement. Feminists attack and say 'you must be a misogynist'. Person *x* feels further alienated from feminism. Rinse and repeat. You are perpetuating the *exact same* divisive strategies that you yourself critiqued within the last year.

Edit:

&gt; /u/eddie_hitler does seem so delusional that he might be red pill

Red pill and men's rights are *not* the same thing. 

&gt; redpill analysis [...] treats all women as if they think and act alike, and encourages traditional gender roles.

&gt; You will find the real misogynists of the world in the Redpill movement, and to that end Redpills are what feminists think we are (or paint us as for propaganda purposes - one or the other), and as long as feminists have all the media in their pockets, it is up to us to prove to the world, again and again and again, that we are not like the redpills.

The only thing I'd have issue with is those who might try to bend the direction of the club in their favour through online campaigning, or who are severely ignorant in the name of the club bringing about embarassment to ourselves. Thankfully that's not an issue we have to deal with. I like being a mod on here with so many of you international fans as I get to hear some interesting perspectives on what it's like being a different kind of fan, and I think it's a good thing for people like you to get to discuss the game with locals and get a feel for what we're about off the pitch. I do think we're a club that is more than the 11 men on the pitch for 90 minutes and being a proper fan of the club has a need for getting into that too. In short:

&gt;Now that Swansea has an international following, what kind of reception (if any) would I receive if I made a pilgrimage to the Liberty?

&gt;&gt;Did she think if he’d been leader in May the rout in Scotland to the SNP might have been tempered?
&gt;
&gt;No. The problem with Corbyn is that he's pushing the same Unionist lines and although he's going to provide the people of England a chance for an alternative, in Scotland and Wales he needs to either get up to speed and modify his somewhat archaic views on devolution and grasp the mantle of either devo max or independence because that's the only way Labour in Scotland are coming back.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Young April Cummings, who might just become the poster-child for resurgent Scottish Labour as did Mhairi Black for the SNP
&gt;
&gt;Cumming is following the Labour path of being in think tanks, and being introduced to the greasy pole of the Labour machine. Black was working in a food bank while at uni.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;All the evidence is that, in Scotland at least, had Corbyn been in charge at the time of the election, even the time of last year’s referendum, Labour’s meltdown may have been substantially mollified.
&gt;
&gt;I think there's a lot of people in England looking at Corbyn thinking 'if we just wave him in front of the Scots they'll fall back in line' but it's not as easy as that. Corbyn may still have had Jim Murphy as 'Scottish' Leader and Murphy, and now Kezia Dugdale are not going to revive anything in Scotland for Labour.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;but I don’t even think his ideas are that radical!
&gt;
&gt;They're not. Most aren't far from what the SNP, Plaid and the Greens were suggesting, and it's insane to think that they're 'hard left' as panicked hacks like Polly Toynbee suggests.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;“I would hope – no, I actually believe – that there are other kinds in so-called middle England. To whom we can say: What kind of society do you want? One with an underlying, fundamental decency? One which chooses not to demonise any further the most vulnerable, swipe at the cheapest targets, the poor and the disabled?”
&gt;
&gt;Here's Labour's problem. To win a UK election it needs to win England. If Middle England rejects even the not exactly radical socially democratic platform Corbyn's Labour (lets assume his party allows him to stay leader longer than five minutes) will push then they'll not just lose, but it might as well support independence because the Union will lie exposed.
&gt;
&gt;This is why Corbyn just repeating 'pooling and sharing' rhetoric isn't going to work because for that to actually be true the entire UK has to believe that, and it's not going to play in Middle England. Just look at the amount of people BTL here who constantly spill bullshit about Barnett.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Did he feel a fundamental decency had been lost then in the last 20 years? “Absolutely.” Did he feel his own party was responsible for aspects of this? “Again, yes. Most certainly culpable, more than culpable. Some of the language used was dreadful.”
&gt;
&gt;It was more than language as Labour in Scotland deliberately kept areas in grinding poverty to ensure they'd carry on voting for them, but otherwise that's the sort of thing Labour's leadership in Scotland should be saying. They should be saying 'actually, part of the reason Scotland (and the UK) have so many problems is we were culpable, but here's how we'll make things better'.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;“And we mobilise young people, and mobilise social media. Yes, there’s hope. Of course there’s great hope.”
&gt;
&gt;Yet they're not getting out into the streets. They've created this bubble after Corbyn's visit to Scotland to make themselves feel better and as much as I do think Corbyn provides the only chance for Labour to kick themselves out of the fall they're in the party needs to be more realistic about what it can do in Scotland. If it still supports the Union and doesn't even consider a federal option then all Corbyn's going to do is try to plug holes on a sinking ship in his party in Scotland.",null,0,null,1439726153,null,null,false,0,cu4rn75,null,t3_3h4zvc,null,null,null,t3_3h4zvc,null,null,null,1441281238,null,0,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

These issues are not going to go away. Corbyn has made an effort to associate himself with individuals from causes (Palestine, United Ireland) who are prepared to use violence to get their way.

To my knowledge he has always said he is a man of peace, and said things like ""all bombings are wrong"".  On the other hand he is slow to condemn individuals for anti-semetic views, or condemn the IRA for their terror campaign.

If you think this stuff will go away. It won't.  Corbyn has had the luxury of being a relatively low-profile MP who could reach out to individuals in public without fear of what it would do to the party. If he is to be leader, he is going to have to have a lot more clarity about why he has some of the these associates and whether he thinks their use of violence is acceptable or not.

The main thing is the way we live our lives, our values, our measure of success don't match what are found to make people happy in research. 

I agree with that. Our education system is framed toward working, attainment and so on, there's very little focus on fostering creative/independent thought, or even useful life skills like political education, critical thinking, budgeting, or even things like growing your own food. 

That's true, I'm not saying it's easy it's just so obvious to me the effect of the media on people's thinking. Again though - you aren't properly taught to question the information you get/ the source of information etc.

I meant make it through the course sorry - due to stress and overwork. They were making light of it and people were laughing, it's very weird. Good point, I don't there there is argument for changes from within but it's hard to overcome when society itself is the real problem - as you're rightly alluding to.

You're right, just an example of vested interests rounding on someone until they're successfully discredited.

If you spend time developing your professional skills, enjoy software development and are good at it, you can command a pretty high salary in a pretty short amount of time.

There are quite a few 'ifs' in all of that, it's completely up to you of course what you want to do.  Make sure you aren't blowing loads of money you don't have, maybe try to keep track of your outgoings once a month to be on the safe side and start putting away what you can, especially as your salary increases.

In terms of relative rents, I'd be surprised to see any reasonable 1-beds below £1200/month in zone 1 but you can get a lot cheaper the further you move out, especially if you're willing to share.

&gt;  “I’m not a fellow traveller because I think there are problems with some of the SNP economic agenda. There’s problems over the privatisation of CalMac [the ferry company operator]. There’s problems over the issue of ScotRail [railways franchise]. There’s issues with going for total fiscal autonomy what then happens to the Barnett formula.”

As [has been pointed out](http://wingsoverscotland.com/the-truth-about-calmac-short-version/), the renewal of the CalMac tender is a renewal of a situation that the SNP previously claimed was ""backdoor privatisation"" and which Labour previously claimed ""most certainly is not [a secret privatisation]"". The [conditions for the tender](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/161181/0043718.pdf) are currently set by the EU, exactly as they were then.

The ScotRail franchise used to be run ([not entirely smoothly](http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/glasgow-train-is-scotland-s-most-delayed-service-1-3859924)) by FirstGroup (who operate in the UK, Ireland, Canada, and the US). It's now [run by Abellio](http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/first-lose-scotrail-franchise-to-dutch-firm-abellio-1-3565659) (a Dutch company who also operate three franchises in England). The conditions for this franchise are also set by the EU, exactly as they were when FirstGroup last won.

The implications of TFA for the Barnett formula are quite straightforward. The 'T' stands for 'total', and so if TFA were ever enacted then the Barnett formula would stop (as would all revenue from Scotland, to be replaced with some form of stipend for services provided by the UK).

&gt; Corbyn claimed he “didn’t see a huge appetite” for further autonomy in Scottish Labour.

I wasn't asking for your personal views on these matters, I was asking (somewhat rhetorically) if you think the public will be on board with him on these views. I doubt that very much. He will, quite rightly, be seen as an old-school left winger who will be a flyweight in the international community.

He will be seen as an international joke for wanting to disband NATO. Our NATO allies will see him as either a pain, or someone who is giving up their commitments. Trident does not have wide-ranging support for dropping it. This support only really exists as you get into the left, which feeds into what I said about echo-chambers.

And it doesn't matter *when* he said it. He said it. That, coupled with his ""let's always just talk about it"" policy will make people understandably worried about what he'd do if Argentina started getting bolshy again.

Consider UCAS the (relatively) definitive list of possible clearing options; above anything else, university registry departments will generally disable further UCAS clearing applications once the course fills.  You can try calling the department - it's possible a few students have a change of circumstances, but I would consider the odds of this being realistic relatively slim.

Be aware that as of last Friday, places are disappearing at a pace - we held our clearing open day yesterday, and have now done the majority of our recruitment.  That said, we usually see a small but steady trickle right up to mid September for the courses which aren't yet full.  Unfortunately, courses generally fill in order of prestige; given the sort of time scale you're thinking of, I suspect you'll be looking outside the [Russell Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Group#Members), simply because students want to go to prestigious universities and they fill first.

Very late applications are possible, but if you have your hopes pinned on a specific prestigious university, even with the best grades in the world, applying in early September will give you a very limited chance.

null,null,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,null,"&gt;I'm probably more of an anarchist or whatever word you wanna use haha then you are, I think we need and should make some major changes to our society.

Well, I believe we need major changes, I just don't believe you'll achieve them being an anarchist. You could, for example, organise as many protests as you like, but you won't change government policy or popular opinion because you're not speaking as a member of society - you're choosing to try and separate yourself from it (even though you're still a part of its machinery). Any change has to be achieved using the current political system and that's why there is only one policy that I am strongly in favour of and that is proportional representation. It's only with PR that non-mainstream political views will carry weight and it's also the main reason why neither of the major political parties are willing to endorse it. 

&gt;I agree with that. Our education system is framed toward working, attainment and so on, there's very little focus on fostering creative/independent thought, or even useful life skills like political education, critical thinking, budgeting, or even things like growing your own food.

This is, to some extent, natural. In principal, I don't actually have an issue with concepts of work and attainment (I believe they're fundamental qualities to build an education system around, actually). The issue I have is with what is considered to be attainment. I've seen the education system throw many an intelligent person by the wayside because they don't conform to its methods. My best friend pretty much flunked a lot of his school subjects but is now earning around £30k because he has a flair for programming which (along with many, many other practical skills) just wasn't even encouraged by the system. Equally, I've seen many a dullard, including some of my top set peers get As and A*s for doing little more than learning by rote. As you suggest, the whole exam system rewards revision rather than conceptual understanding.

The result of that is actually bad for industry, which relies on people who are capable of lateral thinking. The other upshot of it is a society which does not question what it's told which, as you suggest, links back nicely in to this thread. Neither is healthy for the country. 

&gt;I meant make it through the course sorry - due to stress and overwork.

That's what I was referring to as well. I was just pointing out the concept of 'making it' - they haven't really made it anywhere in the long run. University isn't the end of the journey, you turn the final corner and see the mountain looming in front...

&gt;They were making light of it and people were laughing, it's very weird.

Rest assured, they won't be laughing on the inside. It's a coping mechanism. 

&gt;Who likes an office job?

Some people. It really does depend on the job actually. My work is in an office, but is relatively rewarding due to the fact I'm helping people.

&gt;For that reason, Corbyn’s QE looks like one of those ideas that is superficially attractive because it seems to kill two birds with one stone, but on reflection turns out to be a bad idea. If we want to keep an independent central bank we do not want the government putting the bank under pressure to do QE because the government wants more investment, and if that does not happen we do not want the central bank deciding whether extra investment happens.

We're no longer at the zero lower bound for monetary policy (i.e. when central bank interest rates are near zero, but need to go even lower for to provide an adequate supply of money/credit in the economy) - therefore, QE doesn't make sense as a policy and much less PQE.

The contrast here is with Europe, which delayed implementing quantitative easing for years  after the USA and UK did and is only now implementing it to help with the Greek crisis and a sustained slowdown in the European economy. PQE might make sense for the Eurozone - even ignoring the huge problems it causes for central bank independence which SWL discusses - but not for the UK.",null,0,null,1439729230,null,null,false,0,cu4shh8,null,t3_3h6wmi,null,null,null,t3_3h6wmi,null,null,null,1441281636,null,3,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

Couple of random things from mobile. Think I'd think about starting Doughty over Henry. Seems a touch more versatile. However Henry is still a senior figure so I think he'll be automatic for a few games yet. Maybe better option when holding onto a lead at the end. When Sandro comes back though - if his Internacional training has kept him match fit - methinks he takes that spot. Ephraim was waxing lyrical about Faurlin yesterday. I'd start him against Carlisle and see if he's still safe for a longer stretch. Really like Polter - battering ram. Onuoha scampering off onto the attack and weighting the ball to Phillips was a highlight. Overall pleased with him but I can see a few mistakes in him over the stretch. Gladwin looks more promising than Hoilett but early days. Luongo is a battler - really good to have him as well. Chery gets the ball down to his feat beautifully. On the whole I was pretty entertained, with that final scene with JETS miss and the equaliser playing out particularly humorously in my area.

What? I like lots of people of my sex. Does that make me question my sexuality? No. I don't know how someone can questioning their sexuality if they are not willing to engage in or even consider sexual activity with someone of their own sex, hence by definition making them not question their sexuality at all.

Hammond, 39, nicknamed ‘The Hamster’ by fans, suffered brain injuries three years ago while driving a jet-propelled Vampire dragster that flipped and crashed at about 280mph.

&gt;Richard Hammond suffered brain injuries three years ago
He made a remarkable recovery after the crash, and has gone on to present other TV programmes, including BBC1’s Total Wipeout gameshow, and Brainiac on Sky1.

&gt;Lee spends 20 minutes telling audiences about his dislike of Hammond in his show If You Prefer A Milder Comedian, Please Ask For One, at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and he incorporates their schooldays into his routine.

&gt;During one show last week, Lee said: ‘I wish he had died in that crash and that he had been decapitated and that his head had rolled off in front of his wife and that a jagged piece of metal debris from the car had got stuck in his eye and blinded him.

&gt;‘And then his head had rolled on a few more yards into a pool of boiling oil and that his head had retained just enough neural capacity for him to be able to think “ooh, this is bit hot"" before the whole thing exploded into tiny pieces.’

&gt;Later in the routine, he said: ‘I wish Richard Hammond HAD died and I wish he had been decapitated. Of course, it’s a joke. But coincidentally it’s also what I believe.’

However, if any of these behaviours are coupled with bad driving, or lead to an accident, a charge of careless driving, or not being in a position to control the vehicle becomes a distinct possibility.

These behaviours can also be used to show dangerous driving, an offence which could lead to imprisonment, particularly if the dangerous driving causes a death.

A good comparison would be with using mobile telephones. Being seen to use a hand-held phone is now a specific offence (the Highway Code says 'MUST NOT').

Using a hands-free phone is not a specific offence, but provides grounds for a careless or dangerous driving prosecution in the event of erratic driving or an accident.""",null,0,null,1439731412,null,null,false,0,cu4t77j,null,t3_3h7082,null,null,null,t1_cu4t0ni,null,null,null,1441281970,null,29,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29,null

Not sure if there is any research showing how many days 10% takes to achieve skin saturation, if that is what you mean?  The half life is four days (time taken for the amount to reduce by half in the tissues) so there is good opportunity to top up over a longer period of time.

IMO safer is to use more than one active ingredient that hits hyperpigmentation, as well as beef up your holiday sunscreen and sun avoidance strategies.

You're right that governments can 'print' money to 'monetise the debt' directly, which is the major cause of hyperinflation, and hence is considered to be a bad idea.

I'll look at those articles, but if they explain how governments can print loads of money to pay for stuff they can't afford without causing serious inflation, then they're probably wrong.

Edit: I skimmed the first article &amp; it seems incredibly misleading.  

It assumes governments exclusively create money &amp; that if there is no government deficit, there can be no private accumulation of wealth in fiat currency.  Once you realise that bank lending creates most fiat money, this falls apart. 

The article doesn't even mention inflation caused by monetising debt.

Illaramendi's final season at Sociedad has been better than all of Lucas' previous 3 seasons statistically in terms of tackles won, percentage of duels won, blocks and interceptions. Although it's hard to compare because Lucas has a considerably worse fitness record than Illaremendi. 

He also boasted better statistics for successful take-ons, assists, chances created, key passes in his final season at Sociedad. Basically, if he rediscovered that consistency and form with us, he'd be a huge upgrade on Lucas and a far more versatile player.

null,null,Slightly_Lions,null,null,null,"&gt; show me one country that uses the system you're describing, printing money to cover their deficit that isn't a basket case and I will concede the point.

The UK, for one. The following are quotes from the Bank of England [Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q1](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf) (emphasis mine).

&amp;nbsp;

Money supply:    

&gt;In the modern economy, most money takes the form of bank
deposits.  But how those bank deposits are created is often
misunderstood:  the principal way is through commercial
banks making loans.  

/

&gt; Banks first decide how much to lend
depending on the profitable lending opportunities available to
them — which will, crucially, depend on the interest rate set
by the Bank of England.  It is these lending decisions that
determine how many bank deposits are created by the banking
system.  The amount of bank deposits in turn influences how
much central bank money banks want to hold in reserve (to
meet withdrawals by the public, make payments to other
banks, or meet regulatory liquidity requirements), **which is
then, in normal times, supplied on demand by the Bank of
England**.

&amp;nbsp;
  
In other words, there is *no limit* to the amount of money that the Bank of England can credit (this is done digitally) to commercial banks, who use that money to lend to the private sector (thereby, as the quotes above indicate, creating new money and putting it into the economy).

&amp;nbsp;
  
Quantitative easing:  


  
&gt;Consider, for example,
the purchase of £1 billion of government bonds from a pension
fund.  **One way in which the Bank could carry out the purchase
would be to print £1 billion of banknotes** and swap these
directly with the pension fund.  But transacting in such large
quantities of banknotes **is impractical.  These sorts of
transactions are therefore carried out using electronic forms of
money.**

/

&gt;**The Bank of England finances its
purchase by crediting reserves** to the pension fund’s bank — it
gives the commercial bank an IOU (second row).

/

&gt;QE leaves banks with both a new
IOU 
from
the central bank but also a new, equally sized IOU 
to
consumers (in this case, the pension fund)

/

&gt;QE works by
**circumventing the banking sector, aiming to increase private
sector spending directly** 

&amp;nbsp;

In summary: since the government, through its central bank, can (and does) purchase government debt by simply creating new money from nothing, then the government cannot be dependent on debt to fund its deficits. 

In other words, simply by crediting money digitally, the government can fulfil its debt obligations at any time. And if it can purchase debt by creating money, it can purchase anything else (labour, services, goods) in the same way.

The inevitable conclusion is that the UK government does not need to borrow money to fund the deficit; it can fund it by creating money digitally.

Politicians might say that we need to borrow to pay our debts, but that does not make it true.

&amp;nbsp;


Inflation?

And before you say that this will result in out of control inflation, remember what I said earlier: inflation is the *actual* constraint on government spending, not the need to tax or borrow enough money. And bear in mind that we are struggling to create enough inflation at the moment ([0.1% in July, well below the 2% target](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/14/uk-inflation-head-back-zero-bank-england-economists-expect)).

Quantitative easing, in fact, was designed to increase inflation. We created[ £375b](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2012/066.aspx) to do so, and we did not see inflation go out of control - far from it.

Jon Cozart - famous for the YouTube video ""Harry Potter in 99 seconds."" He pretty much does his popular YouTube videos, with a couple of new ones and jokes about his life in between. I was dragged there by a friend but was pleasantly surprised at how good it was - would definitely recommend.

Fairy Tale Theatre: 18 &amp; Over - absolutely hilarious. Another one that was surprisingly good. One of the best shows I've seen at the fringe. They do two sets, so I'll be going again to see the other tales.

Shitfaced Shakespeare - 10/10 as usual. I've never had a bad night at this show and this year was absolute gold. Mileage may vary depending on who/how drunk the performer is.

One Man Breaking Bad - personally I thought it was a bit lacking. Would recommend if it was a free show, but it's not, so give it a miss.

Aunty Donna - didn't stop laughing the whole time. If you like their YouTube stuff you'll love this.

Pick of the Fringe - depends who's on, but if you're looking for ideas of who to see then it's a solid choice. Compere wasn't a twat either (which is more than I can say for Late &amp; Live last year).

Piff the Magic Dragon - maybe it was because this was his first show, but it felt entirely unrehearsed and he just did all the same tricks he's done before. 10 minute strip show at the end.

null,null,SavannaJeff,australia,Australia,null,"&gt;You're talking as if ""the member states"" is the same as ""politicians"" and ""the people living there"". They really aren't and if you ignore that you're ignoring a huge part of application of game theory to politics.

The member states being the European Council - made up of the heads of government from each country, and having been elected by those people. It's just representative democracy. 

&gt;The people who have been involved in these negotiations have no specific mandate to agree this deal. No one, as far as I'm aware, has been specifically elected with TTIP in mind.

Most matters aren't matters which are done with a 'mandate', and over the past 5 years we've seen the word 'mandate' horrifically abused in political discourse. Do you honestly expect a government to seek a hard mandate for every international deal it makes, every political decision? You're essentially arguing for, if not direct democracy, then it's very close and slightly mentally handicapped cousin.

I also fear that your analysis of what my explanation is is horribly reductive, trying to assign extremely simple wording to complex phenomena. 

&gt;So you're using game theory to oversimplify a situation, which is one of the dangers of using game theory. You're also missing the fact that two level game theory is how to get treaties passed in the face of domestic opposition.

This is not what 2LG is about, so you've horrifically misread the paper (if you read the paper), or I didn't explain it well enough.

&gt;However, to people who don't think governments should be agreeing to deals that they staunchly oppose, your justification is irrelevant, as it's telling them something they already know: The reason it's in secret is because they know there is wide spread opposition to it, and yet they want to pass it regardless.

I just think a move like this may send the wrong message to the team.  Then again, we are all simply hoping Mangala turns into a world class player. At his age, for his price, he should already be showing brilliance for long stretches of games. I think we are all a little emotionally attached to Manga because we want him to pull a true City and prove the doubters wrong, but truthfully bringing in Otamendi bridges the gap to Denayer faster - since Otamendi is older. 

It's a tough bit of business. It would be a bit of an indictment for our scouting program to admit defeat on Manga so quickly, but also a statement of intent for City as a big club to say that we make the needed changes to compete in Europe.

Some of what you are describing reminds me of [neurogenic rosacea] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3692271/). Not saying you have that - not even sure it is oficially recognised yet - but you could do a lot worse that treat your skin more as if you did have rosacea. This is all about reducing irritation, inflammation and UV damage.

If it were me I would prioritise dropping/ switching out the aqueous cream and benzoyl peroxide. You might be able to tolerate the tretinoin on larger areas without those which is useful for both acne and anti ageing. Replacement moisturisers - Eucerin 5% urea face cream or CeraVe PM lotion come to mind.

The Simple Refreshing Wash Gel is one of the best/ gentlest foaming or lathering type cleansers in the UK, its not a bad product at all but not ideal for a skin barrier that is really struggling. I actually use it as my hand and body wash! You might well be able to retain it if you can get the skin barrier issues/ inflammation/ irritation under control.

OCM? Yes I think that is worth a try, I would go for ether the jojoba oil you have or something with a mineral oil base which is pretty inert and not normally pore clogging. Use a product with an emulsifier or add your own (polysorbate, cromollient) - this will make it rinse clean with water and light use of a cloth.

I rate [Superdrug B. Clean melting gel cleanser] (http://www.superdrug.com/B-/B-Clean-Melting-Gel-Cleanser-125ml/p/548850) and a muslin cloth without optical brighteners (eBay). Few ingredients in that cleanser, no obvious irritants such as fragrance. It takes a little body heat to melt down to oil, so be patient before starting the massage step or you may find it seems to 'drag' the skin.

If you want to retain the BHA you might consider the [CLEAR daily skin clearing treatment] (http://www.paulaschoice.co.uk/clear-daily-skin-clearing-treatment-azelaic-acid-bha.html) which also has 10% azelaic acid and various other anti inflammatory/ anti irritant ingredients. There is also 15% and 20% azelaic acid on prescription. Various useful properties that sub reasonably well for the BP (anti inflammatory, weak anti microbial, gets into the pore to reduce clogging, increases skin turnover) and possibly also useful in anti ageing (antioxidant).",null,0,null,1439734559,null,null,false,0,cu4uddj,null,t3_3gpc8x,null,null,null,t1_cu1mjea,null,null,null,1441282588,null,2,null,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2,null

null,null,Slightly_Lions,null,null,null,"&gt;That would be a problem as it would cause inflation due to an excessive growth in money supply. 

Well, that's actually my point: the real limit to government spending is not money, taxes or borrowing, but inflation. Currently we are at 0.1% CPI inflation, well under the 2% target set by the government. And we have high unemployment, so there is stuff (labour) for the newly-created money to buy (hyperinflation only occurs where you keep printing money to buy something that is already at full supply).

&gt;It assumes governments exclusively create money &amp; that if there is no government deficit, there can be no private accumulation of wealth in fiat currency. Once you realise that bank lending creates most fiat money, this falls apart.

Here's some quotes directly from the Bank of England [Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q1](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf) (emphasis mine):

&gt;In the modern economy, most money takes the form of bank
deposits.  But how those bank deposits are created is often
misunderstood:  the principal way is through commercial
banks making loans.  

/

&gt;Banks first decide how much to lend
depending on the profitable lending opportunities available to
them — which will, crucially, depend on the interest rate set
by the Bank of England.  It is these lending decisions that
determine how many bank deposits are created by the banking
system.  The amount of bank deposits in turn influences how
much central bank money banks want to hold in reserve (to
meet withdrawals by the public, make payments to other
banks, or meet regulatory liquidity requirements), **which is
then, in normal times, supplied on demand by the Bank of
England**.


  
In other words, the money ultimately comes from the Bank of England, which enables banks to make loans to the private sector. This is government spending, done digitally by crediting bank accounts.

There does not exist a single British pound that was not originally created by the British government and spent into existence. Therefore, yes, the government exclusively creates money, and without a deficit there can be no net increase in private sector savings of GBP.

You probably could. You don't seem to realise there are alot of economists in the world and simply rounding off a couple names and giving a survey from a Keynesian economic school in London does not prove that all economists are Keynesians.

&gt;The only ones that do not are those who work for the ECB or other institutions.

Even if they did; why the hell is that an argument? Almost every single 'economic' advisor in every central bank in the world will be a Keynesian; but it is not a sufficient argument to simply state 'they have a vested interest, therefore their arguments are invalid'.

null,null,nocigs2day,1972crest,,null,"Google trasnslate........................................................Otamendi has done it. His desire to go to another team and improve their sporting and economic benefits are fulfilled. The player moves over the che and will sign for one of the two Manchester, presumably the City, in exchange for 43 million and the possible sale of a player. Nuno squad lost their best player, the leader of the defense and the passing game, one hardly remediable sale at sports. But also a feeling level.

Nicolas Otamendi Valencia reached on payment of 12 million euros to Porto's three variables and after a 6-month assignment to Atletico Mineiro. Substitute the Portuguese side, he was a major outlay for a player who, at the time, was not in the best moment of his career. Valencia decided he, more than anyone. The player arrived, became the leader of an entirely new defense and became the defensive line reference 4 unpublished and was the third least win the league championship. Most experts and fans agreed: Otamendi had been one of the best, if not the best, central League 2014/2015. In addition to its strong defense and power cut, it is also a natural goalscorer in the set pieces, as he showed against rivals Atletico and Real Madrid.

But he finished the course, and after a splendid year, wanted to go. And his agent issued while he was competing in the America's Cup, not the best. Subsequently, the player, confirmed the words of his agent. A cold shower for the supporters of Mestalla, that looked like a player who had become an extension of the fans on the lawn for his character and dedication, he intended to leave. And it is their right. There is 20, it may be his last big contract and may aspire to win titles.

But you can not leave without me to say that there will be one more, maybe fail, it will not be an idol in English land or be given as much love here. Nobody doubted his professionalism to this day it has disrespected the club that pays him. Within the field, playing with discomfort or recovering from a sprained few days, his attitude was irreproachable throughout the season. A player can stop Messi (at least a few times). The heir to Ayala, a central level of a decade that did not look at Mestalla ago. Who knows, maybe if Otamendi stay, in a few years his canvas and his name had been in the front of our stadium, recalling a player antique legend. Woe to those who bought the shirt and now want to remove the '23' and your name, I'm cured of these ailments. But it was not only he will be remembered as a great center that was passing one year and went to another team bad ways and being ungrateful, erasing the target that he has not yet met, which is that Valencia is in the Champions League.

Otamendi is the player that every fan wants in his team, forgetting their lack of professionalism, of course. Claw, power and even goal. The thrust of an entire crowd that wants to players who leave everything on the lawn. We lose as a team with the departure of Otamendi and won as a club. But others went best (and most crashed) and others will come.

Cedric was honestly not that bad, Barkley and Cleverley largely charged through the middle because Wanyama and Davis/Romeu were asked to do too much. Targett was eviscerated by Kone, and he is not a first team player yet.

I said yesterday they need to focus on defense, and I think that is Koeman's plan. Clasie will sit in front of Romeu and Wanyama. That, along with Van Dijk, will hopefully recreate the disruption that they lost when Morgan left.

Their goals will come on the counter, which is where Mane and Long shine (the Aston Villa game). Reserving judgment on Clasie's skill, they don't seem to have the skill to breakdown opponents and control possession and it doesn't make sense to me why they are trying to do so.

Everybody remain calm, Stekelenberg wasn't at fault for anything, Bertrand and Clasie will come back, Van Dijk will come in.

null,null,Slightly_Lions,null,null,null,"Again, a [direct quote](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/qe/qe_faqs.aspx) from the Bank of England:

&gt;The Bank of England electronically creates new money and uses it to purchase gilts from private investors such as pension funds and insurance companies.

There is nothing to be repaid, it is a straightforward purchase, not a debt.  Yes, if the Bank of England still holds the bonds when they come due, the Treasury will pay out, but that is just one branch of government paying another - it's just accounting. And that money would have been paid out in any case, and is separate from the newly created money used to purchase them.

[And:](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Documents/resources/postcards/qecomp.pdf)

&gt;If inflation looks like being 
too high, the Bank of England 
can 
sell these assets
 to 
reduce the amount of money 
and spending
in  the  economy.  

So the Bank of England is making it clear that at times when the economy is overheating (high inflation), it issues debt to encourage private sector savings; while if the economy is doing poorly (low inflation), it might buy back debt through QE to reduce savings and encourage spending (essentially a cash injection).

So can you see how debt issuance by the government is not about funding deficits, but rather about controlling inflation by regulating private sector spending?

I've already said, when you keep saying it, don't be surprised that when you take a poll, the same shite you've been spouting, is parrotted back to you by your audience.

Thats not why they didn't vote in Milliband and you know it.

&gt; 
&gt; Njie is a direct, skillful and unpredictable forward with an explosive turn of pace and a keen eye for goal. He plays largely on instinct and is prone to taking on a little too much himself when teammates are better-positioned, but he works hard and makes good off-the-ball runs to help open up space in the final third.
&gt; 
&gt; Lyon were very flexible in attack last season, with none of their forwards tied down to a particular position. At Spurs, Njie will probably occupy a left-sided role, with the responsibility to stretch opposition defences as Jay Rodriguez did in Mauricio Pochettino's Southampton side (Pochettino, of course, now manages Tottenham). Njie is also likely to function as a backup to Harry Kane in the centre.
&gt; 
&gt; Major Strengths
&gt; 
&gt; - Very quick
&gt; - Good eye for goal
&gt; - Intelligent movement
&gt; 
&gt; Major Weaknesses
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - Decision-making
&gt; - Control in tight areas
&gt;     
&gt;Assessment Breakdown
&gt;     
&gt;Tackling: Prepared to help pressure the ball from the front or to drop back a little to challenge in midfield, but his tackling can be quite clumsy. He committed more than twice as many fouls per 90 minutes (2.02) as he made tackles (0.84) last season.
&gt;     
&gt;Marking: Njie is always willing to track back and help out defensively, although he was largely spared specific marking duties last season due to the way Lyon were set up. While his ability to assist in a high press is known, it will be interesting to see how he adapts to the responsibility of keeping tabs on an opposing full-back.
&gt;     
&gt;Heading: He was involved in fewer than one aerial duel per 90 minutes last season and won less than a third of those. Lyon were not a side who regularly looked to put crosses into the area. When they did, they were usually delivered low.
&gt;     
&gt;Close control: The quality of his first touch is inconsistent, and he doesn't have the necessary technical skills to reliably manipulate the ball away from challenges in tight areas. At pace, however, he is an entirely different proposition, with his explosive acceleration and neat shimmies and touches regularly seeing him past defenders.
&gt;     
&gt;Passing: Capable of rapid-fire interchanges with teammates in the final third, but his passing in other situations can be quite wayward at times, particularly during slower passages of play when he is unable to play on instinct. Can also be guilty of ignoring well-positioned teammates in favour of taking on another man himself.
&gt;     
&gt;Positioning: Lyon usually lined up with two forwards supported by an advanced attacking midfielder last season, and the front two were allowed to drift out into the channels to provide width in the final third. Njie thrived in such a setup and showed an excellent appreciation of how to create space for both himself and his teammates with his movement wide and in behind. He is also very active and alert inside the penalty area.
&gt;     
&gt;Crossing: Mainly looks to cut infield to shoot or link with his teammates when he receives the ball in wide areas. Crossing is often his last resort and his deliveries are rarely of great quality. An area of his game that he needs to improve.
&gt;     
&gt;Finishing: Does a good job of getting his efforts on target, with 63.3 percent of his 49 shots last season at least troubling the goalkeeper.

What research have you done?  Where have you been sourcing your information?  There's an awful lot of money being spent on promoting this deal, and much less money is available to those who are opposing or critiquing it, so, as always with these pieces of legislation being lobbied for hard by commercial interests you have to work ten times as hard to hear one side of the story as the other.  Looking at your comment above, it certainly looks like most of your information is coming directly from the corporate/establishment line.

null,null,dageshi,null,null,null,"No, the bank creates money to buy bonds, if it then sells the bonds it receives the money for the bonds (+ interest) back to the government. The bank created and spent a million to buy the bond, it sells (or the bond expires and is repaid) a million+interest and the money that was created returns to the bank. The bank now has the money it initially created returned to it, what does it now do? Does it roll over the money and buy more bonds, or does it do nothing? If it does nothing then that money is out of circulation, the money was created, it entered the economy and was then withdrawn because it came back to the bank which has not spent it again. To all intends and purposes that money has been ""destroyed"". The central bank can of course create more, but eventually it won't because QE is only a temporary measure in effect because we're at 0% interest rates, it's the stated policy of the bank to withdraw QE over time till the point where there will be no more QE and the Bank will no longer be purchasing government bonds in the way it currently is.

Interest rates are the method typically used to control inflation, not QE.

http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-5

""Central banks are responsible for keeping inflation in check. Before the financial crisis of 2008-09 they managed that by adjusting the interest rate at which banks borrow overnight. If firms were growing nervous about the future and scaling back on investment, the central bank would reduce the overnight rate. That would reduce banks' funding costs and encourage them to make more loans, keeping the economy from falling into recession. By contrast, if credit and spending were getting out of hand and inflation was rising then the central bank would raise the interest rate. When the crisis struck, big central banks like the Fed and the Bank of England slashed their overnight interest-rates to boost the economy. But even cutting the rate as far as it could go, to almost zero, failed to spark recovery. Central banks therefore began experimenting with other tools to encourage banks to pump money into the economy. One of them was QE.


To carry out QE central banks create money by buying securities, such as government bonds, from banks, with electronic cash that did not exist before.""

Therefore eventually the bank will stop QE and return to using interest rates as its main inflation tool, eventually the full deficit whatever that may be will be fully borne by the private sector. Therefore you cannot continue to run large deficits indefinitely in the hope that the BoE will continue to do QE because QE is inherently a temporary policy.

null,null,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,null,"The problem that everyone at the moment has with contextualising current British politics is that the majority of people massively underrate Cameron as a politician, and as a result everyone in politics who loses to Cameron is seen as useless as a consequence.

When you bring into play the fact Cameron, after Blair, is the best politician of our age, who has repeatedly done the political impossible, won two referendums, modernised a party, and that even his worst 'failure', 2010, was still the largest gain the Tories have ever had, then Miliband and Brown can be reanalysed. When you do so, you realise more often than not it was Cameron and the Tories being effective rather than Brown being weak.

This is relevant for Labour too, because in 2020 the Tories single greatest electoral asset, Cameron, will be gone. That has massive implications for whether they can win or not. But that hasn't been discussed once, because it would require Labour to recognise Cameron's skill, which they are reluctant to do.

null,null,IS_REALLY_OFFENSIVE,null,null,null,"You know, posting several anecdotes about invidual people hardly counts as evidence against a group that in total consists of tens of thousands of people.

&gt;Or consider the modern age. Women can hit, can abuse men and it is seen as completely acceptable. Or that women who make fake rape claims can utterly destroy a man's life and nothing happens to them. 

This may be **partially** true. I say partially because no domestic violence is seen as acceptable, I find it incredible that you would claim that. And about these ""false rape"" claims. Do you know how incredibly rare those are? And that those claim are made by both genders? And do you know that penalty for false testimony is a prison sentence of several years (at least in my country).

Now the thing you are right about is that the violence towards men often goes unnoticed and that many people don't care about that. However, the biggest reason for that is that men are afraid of reporting it because of fear of being seen as ""weak"". Men are often expected to be masculine and to hide their emotions. That is the cause for this issue. It has been like that before feminism existed and it will always be like that unless men who are interested about this want to create a male equivalent of feminism.

TL;DR The issue is caused by the society as a whole and feminism has nothing to do with it.

&gt;Then you're *probably* an egalitarian. I say probably because many claim to fight for equality but want no such thing.

I do want equality. However I can still identify as a feminist. I would also identify as a men's rights activist but that movement has long ago destroyed itself. It's not pro-men. It's anti-feminist.

null,null,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"&gt;The member states being the European Council - made up of the heads of government from each country, and having been elected by those people. It's just representative democracy.

It is, but the distinction is important because it's critical to recognise that representatives can act contrary to public interests, and can certainly act contrary to their mandate of representing the people who elected them.

&gt;Most matters aren't matters which are done with a 'mandate', and over the past 5 years we've seen the word 'mandate' horrifically abused in political discourse. Do you honestly expect a government to seek a hard mandate for every international deal it makes, every political decision? You're essentially arguing for, if not direct democracy, then it's very close and slightly mentally handicapped cousin.

No, I'm saying the distinction is important to make because you need to recognise that representatives with a mandate to represent the best interest of the people don't always follow that mandate.

To take a really extreme example to illustrate my point, the US President is elected with a mandate to represent the best interest of his people. However, there's nothing constitutionally stopping them from immediately pardoning every single criminal in the country. People would, rightly, say that this isn't in the public's best interest, yet they are able to do it.

&gt;I also fear that your analysis of what my explanation is is horribly reductive, trying to assign extremely simple wording to complex phenomena.

No, I'm taking what you've said and countering your points. All your comments seem to indicate you've not considered the fact that representatives might not be representing the will of the people. Therefore you are connecting ""The head of government said this is OK"" to ""The people of that country want this"" when it is not guaranteed such a connection exists. 

&gt;This is not what 2LG is about, so you've horrifically misread the paper (if you read the paper), or I didn't explain it well enough.

It's exactly what it's about.

It's about the fact that domestic pressure can change the goals of the treaty by changing what each party is prepared to accept. As each party has a shorter and shorter list of things they will allow in the treaty (or a longer and longer list of things they demand must be in a treaty) it is harder to pass said treaty because the common ground between all participants is shorter.

My entire point is that maybe that reduction in acceptable parts of the treaty is a good thing. Your entire premise is that the passing of the treaty is a net gain for the people of the country, whereas this may not be the case.

&gt;Bit silly to oppose something when you don't even know what it contains yet.

This actually made me laugh because at first I thought you were being tongue in cheek but then I realised based on the rest of your response you're being entirely serious.

null,null,Verpae,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,null,"Taxation is definitely a left/right issue, because that involves the state.

What do you mean ""their balance of editorial"" and ""what they report on"" is right-wing?

Like, I don't see how they're anything but a comprehensive and centrist newspaper. The definition of centrist is believing in both left-wing and right-wing ideals combined, whilst rejecting extremism from either end. Which is what they do. 

All you've said to me is ""they supported the Tories"" (which is misleading and disingenuous - they said that all parties were bad but Conservatives were perhaps the least bad), ""criticising policies that the right-wing are famous for endorsing doesn't make them not right-wing"" (which is true, but irrelevant, because you've still not actually given me any proof that TE are right-wing in the first place), and ""they support two extremely watered down right-wing ideals"" (free market, except they don't believe in the free market and they support regulation; small state, except they do believe in having a very wide support net and welfare state and argue *against* privitising things such as healthcare and are actively critical of that business model as being unethical and inefficient).

Literally some basic googling provides access to actual court documents, academic reporting on the deals, press releases, open documentation, negotiation document portals. It's really not rocket science to get to sound sources.

Case law can be found here: http://www.italaw.com/
Documentation from the process can be found here: http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/documents-and-events/index_en.htm#_documents

&gt;much less money is available to those who are opposing or critiquing it. 

Do remember that there is a shit load of money to be made in selling clickbait hits, and getting donations and political visibility by feeding on the ""trade = evil, corporations = evil, governments = bad"" demographic. 

Politicians love the populism of opposing this sort of thing with lazy protectionist language, and professional activists relish the chance to whip up a movement who will patronise their work. Media outlets love looking like they are ""right on"" with easy anti-corporate soundbites (just don't mention the parent companies!).

&gt;it certainly looks like most of your information is coming directly from the corporate/establishment line

Well, it's certainly coming from formal, accountable sources. I guess you can always claim that everything is a grand conspiracy and thousands of politicians, economists and international development professionals are all in on this scam, but in the real world, decisions are made from such sources and outright lies are called out (unlike in the anti-trade blogosphere). 

This is a good example of the dialogue amongst practising trade economists: http://www.voxeu.org/article/ttip-free-trade-coming-north-atlantic 


&gt;you have to work ten times as hard to hear one side of the story as the other 

I can very easily get a huge number of hits from places like the huffington post, NYT and reddit front page telling me rumours about how evil all these treaties are. The actual facts are found in dry primary resources, hidden because the actual facts are all terribly boring, and don't speak to the target demographic's preconceptions about ""teh evil corporations"". 

I'd argue that the anti-trade crowd are winning the air war by a country mile. 


&gt;Have you read this report for example? 

No, but you'll forgive me for treating a report with opening chapter ""Transatlantic trade &amp; the corporate utopia"", a logo of the globe with a barcode over it, and a whole section on anti-GMO woo as firmly in the ""probably ideologically motivated to the point of uselessness"" category. A quick skim confirmed the same. 

A much better example of decent critical report would have been something like this: 
* http://iatp.org/files/2013_10_25_TTIP_KHK.pdf 
or this
* http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2540639 

Both of which highlight valid criticisms and concerns (the specifics of which are precisely the kinds of issues being discussed in the negotiations).

1) I deal with teenage (18yr-22yr) old girls EVERY night we are open that pre-drink at their friends houses, get into a nightclub, keep drinking, and then pass out due to the effects of alcohol.

2) This happens more often with women than men for some reason.

3) It is an offense to be drunk (within reason) on a licensed premises in Scotland. 

4) Around 50% of the girls we deal with claim they have been 'spiked'. In four years I have seen 1 incident where there was potential for foul play.

The staff at that club have a legal obligation to remove that person from the premises if they think her being there is a safety concern. They did everything by the book in removing her and calling an ambulance. 

People need to remember that this ~~girl~~ woman is an adult. She is fully responsible for herself and if she chooses to drink in a way which is irresponsible she is going to wake up in hospital. I do feel sorry for her because by causing such a scene, and drinking so irresponsibly, she's going to find it very difficult to get into a lot of places in Edinburgh and Dundee (where she is at uni). 

Would like to add a wee note at the end of this: **GIRLS if you are drinking at night please please please eat like a normal human being; food will help massively with the effects of alcohol and helps to keep you hydrated. If you are out PLEASE have a water or two throughout the night. If you are worried about putting on weight by eating lots of food during the day then I would like to let you know that binge drinking is very fattening so cut the booze before food.** ",null,0,null,1439740493,null,null,false,0,cu4x34g,null,t3_3h79xq,null,null,null,t3_3h79xq,null,null,null,1441283867,null,22,null,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,22,null

I don't hate Moffat either but since it seems like he has difficulty juggling both of his shows sometimes and it's been 5 years since he took over, it would be cool if they tried out a new show runner and let Moffat go back to writing one mind blowingly good epiode each season. 

It's kind of the same thing with Clara, I loved her season 8 character development and storyline but they should have committed to the excellent end for the character in *Death in Heaven*. That was a consistent, sad, elegant, slightly bittersweet conclusion to her character and storyline. 

Having her come back in the next episode is sort of like having Rose get trapped in the other dimension but then immediately break through it in the next episode and stick around for season 3.

null,null,nonotreally11,null,null,null,"If Britain’s Labour party chooses Jeremy Corbyn as its leader, no historical comparison will do the event justice. Parties have been eccentrically led before — Labour by Michael Foot in the 1980s, the Conservatives by Iain Duncan Smith in the last decade — but this committed socialist, with his taste for nationalisation at home and pacifism abroad, represents another order of stridency altogether.


Nor does the continental boom in far-left politics offer a point of reference. Podemos in Spain and Syriza in Greece are scrappy young parties that define themselves against the mainstream. Labour, by contrast, is more than a century old. It has provided five prime ministers since the second world war. The sudden transformation of an established party is more shocking than the eruption of a new one.



It is easier to understand Corbynism as a process of venting than as a blueprint for power. Many of the young idealists and trade union members who support him know he cannot win a general election. Their goal is a full-throated protest movement against fiscal austerity and “neoliberalism”. They are redefining the purpose of politics.


This is legitimate, exciting and, for Labour, catastrophic. A Corbyn leadership would immediately pit moderates against hardliners, risking the kind of formal split that occurred in the 1980s.


Even if Mr Corbyn is quickly deposed, the radioactive half-life would last for years. The governing Conservatives would portray Labour as a party that is always vulnerable to an extremist lurch. Voters, who rejected Labour resoundingly in May, would have no trouble believing that. Even if Mr Corbyn narrowly loses out to Yvette Cooper, the leadership rival who finally spoke out against him on Thursday, the sheer scale of his following would drag her to the left.


In short, there is now no good outcome for Labour. But gleeful Tories should worry about the damage to the body politic, too. An absence of serious opposition cannot be healthy in a system that already concentrates power in the executive. It also raises questions of protocol: should the government share sensitive information about national security with the opposition leader, as is the convention? If Mr Corbyn’s economic policies are quaint, his outlook on foreign policy is more troubling, as is some of the company he keeps in the anti-war movement.


Then there is the potential for havoc in the Tory party itself. Rebellious MPs might write off the opposition and assume they can now cause trouble for David Cameron, the prime minister, without consequences. Fear of the enemy has glued the Tories together in the past but it would fade if Labour became plainly unelectable. Mr Cameron has a slim majority in parliament and a divisive referendum on EU membership to get through. If a Corbyn-led Labour party campaigns for Brexit, some Tories will not forgive Mr Cameron for doing the opposite.


It is customary to see the Corbyn sensation as part of a broader crisis of moderate social democracy in Europe. But there was nothing inevitable about it. Labour chose to move left in the last parliament, inadvertently preparing the ground for someone like Mr Corbyn. Labour chose to open up its leadership election to activists with no real commitment to the party. And Labour MPs with no intention of voting for Mr Corbyn chose to nominate him to widen the range of views in the contest.
Folly upon folly has brought a grand political party to this predicament, from which it is not certain to recover. That would be bad enough. The potential harm to the rest of British public life is just as worrying.

null,null,MuchWittering,null,null,null,"Yep, I agree with this, particularly as there's no point buying microwave cookware if the kitchen doesn't have a microwave - our campus house just had two gas rings in the kitchen, so you had to be creative as to what you cooked. Luckily we were allowed small electricals in our rooms, so loads of us had electric kettles and toasters, and the guy who had the Breville sandwich maker was VERY popular, but had to insist fairly early on that we contributed bread and fillings as we were eating him out of house and home. 

Tupperware of various sizes is essential, but the cheap sets generally aren't microwave safe, although that's not a problem if she doesn't have access to a microwave. I'd also recommend getting a couple of [these](https://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=18&amp;Sub=78&amp;PID=304) and decanting a bit of the various herbs and spices you have at home into each one, so she's got her own mini spice rack. She can buy her own pots of the stuff she uses a lot, but it means she doesn't have to do that straight away, nor waste money on a whole pot of paprika just for one recipe.  Don't forget to label them though :-)

null,null,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,null,"I found myself homeless a number of years ago, and it's tough! 23rd of December, my mother and I had a row about something while I was on my way out to work my part time job at 9pm, she demanded my door key as I left and that was that. Our relationship was full of abuse, and her alcoholism (which I later inherited) didn't help. My work colleagues allowed me an hour to head up to a homeless charity still open at that time of the night whereby I had an interesting conversation with some Jehovah's Witnesses who stopped me in the street... it turns out that (a) with no door to knock on, they'll still pester you and (b) they didn't actually give a shit. I went on an Interview that night, but had to go back a week later, and didn't get accommodation with them for another 4 weeks or so. What I did in the middle was a life changing experience, allies and enemies changed literally overnight and I lived some of my darkest days living off instant mash, and pushing my clothes ironing board and radio around in a shopping trolley simply for having no place to leave them! I had to drop out of school, missed all my A-Level exams (although my maths teacher Mrs. Golabek from Longdean pulled all the stops and managed to combine my coursework into my only A-level in Mathematics!) as homeless students get zero help while job seekers get a liveable income.

But there is help out there, lots of help if you know where to turn.

**The Council:** Generally useless however Leeds council seem to be more proactive than my local council was back then. Go see your local council first, as other councils will be less willing to help if you're moving into the area. Get on the housing register, but don't hold out hope as I assume you're not classed as a vulnerable adult or have any dependants. You'll be waiting for ever, but it's no harm being on the list just in case.  **One thing to discuss with them however is whether they work with any Charities for situations like this where you can get a referral in.** Some housing associations and charities will be referral only, so keep your options open. http://www.leeds.gov.uk/residents/Pages/Homelessness.aspx is Leeds' own advice page, but your local one may be a better option. The councils I dealt with on behalf of myself and friends focus more on avoiding homelessness rather than finding you a home, and will sometimes recommend relationship counselling between yourself and parents or try to find some way of avoiding the eviction to start with. Housing and homelessness wise, this is obviously the cleanest solution, but is often not the simplest. It wasn't in mine and I feel the same thing could be coming for you. You were given notice so maybe there's something to salvage, but not knowing your full situation, move on if it's not. Find a job, pay some rent to your rents and save a couple of months for your own pad.

**Charities:** These are your best bet if parental resolution is out, Shelter is one very good charity, but check out your University as some offer housing advice for students finishing courses and finding themselves in similar situations. The YMCA is very good (and they have one in Leeds), I did stay at the one in Watford for a couple of months which helped give me grounding to move back into my normal life. It's restrictive, although as surrogate parents, it needs to be, and they did a fantastic job. Also look for a housing advice office somewhere, they can be council or charity run in your area and are always worth a drop in. Don't rely on one to do everything for you, you're going to have loads of time, visit all of them and keep your options open.

**Location:** You mention relocating to Leeds, be aware that many charities and councils will prioritise people who have some financial or strong family connection to the area. People moving in from outside will often be downgraded, depending on where you're coming from, you might be best staying there to find your feet rather than moving for better chances. You're an instant problem to your current council, but one you might move to has no responsibility to you.

**Money:** This should really come first, but housing charities usually guide you through this as part of their service. You need money, but while Homeless and with recent student experience, probably not very much. There are a few places to turn:

**Government/Benefits:** JSA requires you to be actively looking for a job and from what you've said seems to be the most sensible way forward. Housing Benefit can be claimed on the same interview once you find a place, however a local housing charity will also be able to point you in the right direction. There is such a thing as a crisis loan, however again I don't believe this is a service you should need in your situation, I certainly never had to touch it.

**Job:** Ideally you need an address, if you're still on good terms with parents, this might not be an issue, you can move around but still have a place to tell employers, send wage slips etc. keeping your housing situation private. If this is an issue, you may suffer a short term catch 22 situation, you need a home for a job, and a job for a home. Focus on the home, it's easier to be jobless in a home than homeless in a job... I've done both. I used to turn up to work with a shopping trolley of my belongings, use a laundrette for my clothes and local swimming facilities for a shower... not fun, but with understanding employers it could have been worse.

**Things to keep in mind:**
I didn't get any notice of my parental eviction, we just fell out and parted ways on the spot. I already had a part time job, so kept hold of that for as long as I needed to pay rents, deposits and bills, but it still took about 4 weeks before a local homeless charity had a permanent place to stay.

Friends can be very unreliable, as can family. One family member stepped up and I stayed there for 2 nights over Christmas (Thank you Auntie Nic!), but they lived too far from my job to be sensible and I squatted in a flat for a couple of weeks living out of a shopping trolley to ensure the flat was clean and empty every morning in case the owners came home. If they were home, I wouldn't go back (this never happened), but I wanted to keep my staying there secret. I should state it was an empty flat between tenancies, not one I hopped into while someone was on holiday. I couldn't do that morally or without losing sleep knowing the family could return home any moment. An empty flat is much easier, although I had no hot water or heating and we were in the middle of winter!

Back to friends etc. if you can stay there short term, keep in mind that you're a huge inconvenience and it is ONLY short term! Any longer and you could lose a friend. Short term means you've made a great one and owe them a MASSIVE favour! Be extra helpful around the house, clean up, be quiet and uber respectful, cook dinners, pay for takeaways if necessary, and be open to discussing your full financial situation honestly with proof that their help is doing something and you have a plan to get out asap.

If you live in a specialist charity or housing association, the rents can be astronomical! But based on the fact that housing benefit is paying for it. This landed me in a little trouble as the second I got a job, I would lose housing benefit and lose so much of my minimum wage wages, that it would have been impossible to save for a deposit for private accommodation while paying it. I will admit I lied at this stage and earned a full month salary which I didn't declare. This was purely so I could hightail it out of the YMCA and get back on my feet. In my eyes, I could justify what was essentially benefit fraud because I knew once I was out, I would be out properly freeing up my room and paying taxes, this would cost the system less overall than staying there month after month, holding up accommodation which someone else could use while slowly raising a deposit and rent. 

Incidentally, it was on that move, I moved into a shitty little run down HMO in which I met a young lady who our landlord imported enrolling her in a non-
existent college taking all her money for a completely bogus visa and course. We've been married 8 years now.

Life is a funny old thing, and things can go from bad to worse, or great to amazing. With no home, and no job, it can feel VERY lonely. You're far from alone in that situation, you share the stresses with so many others, and there is so much help out there waiting to springboard you into your new life. The media moans about this and that and people whine about the state of this country, but you couldn't be any luckier being born here! Don't be ashamed to use the help, get on your feet, and when like me you're married, happy, in a nice home in a nice place with a life you've carved out, remember those people who did help, and those charities who now need your help.

But one step at a time, and good luck! It's a fun ride, stay positive, enjoy the company of the numerous people you're about to meet and try to make a good impression on everyone. Be prepared to make difficult decisions, but work hard and this short hiccough will be a fond memory you can recount for years.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that the UK is a very comfortable country, no matter how low you go, you're always in a recoverable position. Find the right ladder, and climb it in the right way, even homeless and jobless, you can be in a completely different situation in just a couple of weeks.

Your mistake here is to assume Umunna (and the many people in the party like him) don't share those values. They do. They're just willing to look beyond nationalising services, leaving NATO, and rent controls to achieve it.

Poll after poll shows that Labour were not trusted with the economy and thought we'd be too generous with welfare.  You have to address those issues.

null,null,SavannaJeff,australia,Australia,null,"&gt;The government passing deals in secret because it knows the public would oppose them is not a good thing.

They're not passing deals in secret. They're negotiating them. Most bills you won't see until there's a first draft available. Same thing here.

&gt;It is, but the distinction is important because it's critical to recognise that representatives can act contrary to public interests, and can certainly act contrary to their mandate of representing the people who elected them.

Of course they can. But this is the case with domestic policy as well. You're not railing against TTIP here, you're railing against representative democracy.

&gt;To take a really extreme example to illustrate my point, the US President is elected with a mandate to represent the best interest of his people. However, there's nothing constitutionally stopping them from immediately pardoning every single criminal in the country. People would, rightly, say that this isn't in the public's best interest, yet they are able to do it.

I put it to you that to say that our heads of government do not have the mandate and support of the public to pursue favourable trade agreements is an extreme position, not representative of the majority of the public.

&gt;No, I'm taking what you've said and countering your points. All your comments seem to indicate you've not considered the fact that representatives might not be representing the will of the people. Therefore you are connecting ""The head of government said this is OK"" to ""The people of that country want this"" when it is not guaranteed such a connection exists.

Of course they might not be. But pragmatically, and realistically, they do within the system of representative democracy that we have. 

&gt;It's about the fact that domestic pressure can change the goals of the treaty by changing what each party is prepared to accept. As each party has a shorter and shorter list of things they will allow in the treaty (or a longer and longer list of things they demand must be in a treaty) it is harder to pass said treaty because the common ground between all participants is shorter.

Then you've completely misunderstood the paper. Your entire post is presupposing a utopia that simply doesn't exist, as opposed to the pragmatic realities of representative democracy and international negotiation.",null,0,null,1439742252,null,null,false,0,cu4xzfr,null,t3_3h2wdr,null,null,null,t1_cu4wkt6,null,null,null,1441284290,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

1. The original Nazis where elected at a time when no one could foresee the consequences because that time had not taken place.

2. The position Germany was at both politically and economically in the 1920s was completely different to modern times.

3. In the 1920s the general population (across the globe) were easily fooled by scapegoats and conspiracies. The times were very dogmatic and vast populations remained ill informed.

Hitler was a product of his time, Such ideas in the 21st century are only believed by few of less intellect.

However, they are very well located in areas away from the main chains yet still near big population centres, and have been around long before the burger craze hit full swing, and thus have an epic reputation.

http://www.atomicburger.co.uk/ - These guys take another route; they go with excess and with style. They create crazy burgers with ridiculous amounts of toppings and ridiculous flavours. The restaurants are very, very heavily themed which is how they have carved out their niche, all their burgers have celeb based names and there is a very well cultivated 'retro' 80s-90s atmosphere in the place. Again, the Bristol one at least, is located in an area away from driect competition (there is a pub nearby that does very good burgers, but the feel of the place could not be more different), yet also near a big 'hip' population area.

I'm sorry, I don't really follow what you're saying about QE in your first paragraph. 

In any case, I simply use QE, and BoE lending to commercial banks, as an example to show that:   
1. the government *routinely* creates money from nothing   
2. when it spends this money, the net amount of money in the private sector is increased (assuming a deficit)  
3. there are no adverse effects, provided inflation targets are monitored  
4. the money is not backed by anything, nor is it borrowed or raised through taxes   
5. when it is spent into existence, this new money creates no loans or obligations other than payment for, and provision of, the purchased goods or services

Also, paradoxically, it's safer to have a sharp knife with a sturdy blade. Sure it cuts well, but it's easier to use it correctly and thus reduces accidents.

I've had a sabatier I was bought the year I moved out of home, and it's been a constant companion. I would never have budgeted the amount it cost (a mere thirty quid) because I was so broke and I knew no better, so someone buying it for me was a godsend.

If you had a squad of combat engineers and all the gear you could make a real go of it. Sever a 15-30 foot span in the middle, leaving the utility supplies intact and then reinforce/concertina wire them. Once civilisation on the mainland fails entirely and the water supply dries up you sever that link too. Rig a rope bridge and a deployable wooden span study enough to roll a car over for supply retrieval, and fix up the mooring points on the east side. You've then got a bastion almost invulnerable to zombies and hard to assault for humans.

On the flip side you'd need serious resources to move a self-sufficient operation over there, you'd be vulnerable to jerry-rigged bombardment, upkeep would be very difficult in the medium-term and you'd have to use hydroponics because no outdoor grow method would work in the continuous salt-spray conditions.",null,0,null,1439742984,null,null,false,0,cu4ycoc,null,t3_3h52jl,null,null,null,t1_cu4s2cp,null,null,null,1441284463,null,2,null,brighton,t5_2qprp,2,null

What you end up getting will depend on your daughter's cooking skills and her general laziness, and also on how much you want to spend. 


Ultimately, you should remember that whatever you buy, don't expect her to have it by the end of university. Mugs/plates/glasses easily get broken when drunk people are around (or even without the drunks), and cutlery always seems to disappear by the end of each year. Even if she has good housemates, she may still end up with things getting damaged (e.g. non-stick frying pans getting scratched). 


Also, be sure to check that by self-catered they don't mean that they provide you with just an oven and microwave and nothing else. I fell into this trap in 1st year and only realised at the last minute that I needed pots and pans. If there is going to be nothing, she will need standard kit also.


Some things that I've found that are useful ( that are the more non-standard stuff):

. A slow cooker - If she has a lecture a 2pm, she can prep a spag bol or a chili, etc. and it'll be done for when she wants food in the evening

. A rice cooker - Most of my friends have a rice cooker, as they do perfect rice easily, and depending on the type you get can also be used to steam vegetables

. Egg poacher - Probably the easier and most healthy way to do an egg, and they're easy to use and clean, so doing egg on toast is a breeze

. A lot of tin foil - When you're busy/lazy it's a lot easier to put tinfoil down in a baking tray for food so you can reuse the baking tray than having to wash it over and over again

. Flask - When it's freezing cold in the lecture theatres, I see so many students bring a flask of tea/coffee. They're useful if you want a warm drink and want to save some money

. Juicer - Not for everyone, but from what I've been told they're brilliant for getting your five a day in 

The following are dependent on whether she drinks/plans on having people round who drink 
. Cocktail kit - This is more of a novelty than something useful, but are always good for when you want to impress people are making something a bit more interesting to drink!

. Plastic cups - Plastic cups (also disposable) are a godsend at house parties and pre-drinks and wont smash.

. Shot glasses - Freshers week is the big drinking week and shot glasses are a good addition to a flat!

But look to the whole relevant section and not just picking out a single verse. [Matthew 5:17-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17-20&amp;amp;version=NRSVA)
&gt;17 ‘Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfil. 18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. 19 Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

And remember that's talking to Jews, not the gentile Christians which many are. He freed the people from the law by fulfilling it, and whilst it may remain, all one needs is faith in Christ and are we made righteous. [Romans 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3&amp;amp;version=NRSVA).

null,null,Slightly_Lions,null,null,null,"&gt;  It's politicians that have concocted the need for austerity, not economists.

But that's precisely and explicitly the argument the article is making. I can only conclude that you just skimmed the article and formed a mistaken impression.

I mean, did you read any of this:

&gt; I’ll let you in on a little secret: most people talking about the economy have got no idea what they are talking about. They aren’t economists. Most of what they say has no basis in economic theory or evidence. **And the vast majority of actual economists can’t believe anyone takes what politicians have to say about the economy seriously.**

/

&gt;When the **prime minister contradicted his most senior economic adviser**, the media barely commented. They know the prime minister is just saying the words he needed to say that day. **That’s not economics; it’s politics in disguise.**

/

&gt;The audit was led by Tony Shepherd, the former president of the Business Council of Australia. Like most, **he is not an economist.** But clearly the prime minister thought that because Shepherd was a businessperson he was well placed to advise the government on everything from tax reform to health policy. **It didn’t go well.** 

/

&gt;People like Shepherd, Abetz and Hockey **are not talking about what the economy needs**; they are talking about what their interest groups or constituents want. 

/

&gt;**According to economists at the International Monetary Fund** (IMF), Peter Costello was Australia’s most profligate treasurer of the past 50 years.

/

&gt;The idea that a budget surplus is proof of good policy has **no basis in economics.**

/

&gt;**Virtually all economists agree** that such a fiscal stimulus when the economy is already booming is the exact opposite of responsible economic management. 

/

&gt;**He wasn’t doing economic policy; he was doing politics.**

/

&gt;Just as he ignores his treasury secretary on the housing bubble, **the prime minister ignores economic trends** that don’t fit in with his politics.

/

&gt;**Virtually every economist would agree** that, in the long run, investment in education is the best way to boost productivity, labour-force participation and GDP growth. 

/

&gt;Again, **his words have nothing to do with economics** and everything to do with politics.

/

&gt;In a recent essay on austerity policies in Europe, **the Nobel Prize–winning economist Amartya Sen observed**, “As it is quite common these days to blame economists for failing to see the real world, I take this opportunity to note that **very few professionally trained economists were persuaded by the direction in which those in charge of European finances decided to take Europe.”**

/

&gt;**But Hockey is a politician, not an economist,** and his party won government on the back of a simple slogan that debt was bad. His expertise in econospeak has prevented him from expertly managing a slowing economy.

/

&gt;**Our politicians pretend that it is a choice made by “the markets”.** It’s not. It’s a choice made by our politicians.

/

&gt;Those are the sentiments of some wealthy people, and some politicians who represent them. But **they say it in econospeak because it sounds so ridiculous in plain English.**",null,0,null,1439743631,null,null,false,0,cu4yp40,null,t3_3h3a95,null,null,null,t1_cu4x4r6,null,null,null,1441284626,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,TomViolence,scot-hebrides,Sheep Shagging Teuchter,null,"&gt; Also, do you care to qualify your remark about the fascists being better than liberals? That's pretty fucked up.

Well, it's quite simple, I can far more easily trust the word of someone who's up front about supporting the structures of power than a disingenuous liberal apologist.  It doesn't really require qualification.  It's a simple case of ""better the devil you know.""

&gt; Your beloved socialism wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the philosophical foundation of early liberalism and the welfare state was instituted in Britain under Liberal PM H. H. Asquith.

Your beloved liberalism wouldn't exist without about 1500 years of pre-existing political theory.  If we are to peel everything back to first principles should we maybe return to Plato's republic as the definitive text and ignore all progress that's happened since?  As for the welfare state, its current incarnation can more directly be traced to the efforts of labour prime minister Clement Attlee but that's largely irrelevant anyway because the post-war concensus didn't go nearly far enough in my opinion.

&gt; I'll grant you lot the NHS, that's pretty nice but why shouldn't the middle class feel pissy when we're the ones who have so much of our money taken from us through taxation?

Well, I would ask you this: what entitles you to be well off?  Do you think you're entitled to be paid as much as you are due to your ""hard work,"" when a woman working 10-16 hour days cleaning offices for a living barely makes enough to maintain her modest lifestyle and support her family?  Probably not, because you're oh-so-conscientious and make sure to only buy fair trade coffee or some bullshit.  I'm sure you'd be the first to tut at the terrible circumstances of those poor, poor people at the bottom.  But at the same time you'd also be among the first to bring up ""muh taxes"" when somebody draws attention to it, as you just have.

Now, I'm more than happy to agree that the bottom two thirds of the population are unfairly bludgeoned by the taxes levied on them, but there is a degree of collaboration taking place in which middle-class liberals and upper-class conseratives both consider taxation to be anti-business or anti-aspiration or anti-entrepeneur and all believe themselves to be some sort of moneymaking go-getter that can only be harmed by such legislation, which is a net harm to society because wealth creators and job creators and blah blah.  Liberals, of course, temper this with philanthropy to assuage their guilt, thinking if they send enough mosquito nets to Africa this somehow counteracts the corrosive effect they're having on the welfare of the poor both at home and abroad.  And really, everyone should pay taxes if they're in a position to do so, because public spending on health, education and infrastructure make everything better for *everyone.*

Liberalism is a wonderful ideology that allows us all to believe we are part of the solution when in fact we contribute to the very problems we profess to combat.  Because the truth must, *must* be somewhere in the middle.  The status quo is the new god and any who try to disrupt it are dangerous and deluded for acting against the concensus, even if in the end such disruption would benefit everyone, from richest to poorest.",null,0,null,1439743884,null,null,false,0,cu4yu36,null,t3_3h3gfw,null,null,null,t1_cu4xz71,null,null,null,1441284691,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,d0mth0ma5,null,null,null,"Ed Miliband had a tough time on Question Time last week. “This country did suffer because Gordon Brown sold gold to prop up the social services,” an irate questioner said.


It’s odd that Mr Miliband had no prepared answer. Perhaps he didn’t recall the Conservative poster from 2010, depicting Mr Brown saying: “I lost £6 billion selling off Britain’s gold. Vote for me.”
It’s a potent image of recklessness, but it’s wrong. Mr Brown’s decision in 1999 to sell part of Britain’s gold reserves was prudent. Though Mr Miliband won’t defend him, I will.


Between 1999 and 2002, the Bank of England sold about 395 tonnes of gold. This represented just over 55 per cent of its gold reserves. The average price realised was slightly more than $275 per troy ounce and the proceeds amounted to £3.5 billion.
Then the gold price went up. And up. It peaked at $1,921 an ounce in 2011. Mr Brown, it turned out, had sold at the bottom of the market. Doesn’t that prove his incompetence?


No. As Mr Miliband might have pointed out, Mr Brown did not sell gold to finance spending, he did it to diversify the reserves, of which more than 40 per cent were held in gold. The proceeds weren’t frittered away on gin and lottery tickets. They were invested in foreign currency assets, in a proportion of 40 per cent dollars, 40 per cent euros and 20 per cent yen. That was sound financial management.
The traditional case for holding gold is that it is a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Both claims are contentious and I’d call them superstitions; demand for gold may be driven by things that have nothing to do with the wider economy, such as dentistry. Even if you’re swayed by them, though, they don’t imply that you should allocate 40 per cent of a portfolio to gold.


How much an asset is really worth (its “intrinsic value”, in the jargon) depends on the cash that it will generate: interest, dividends or (for property) rental income. Investors who manage long-term funds, such as pension and life funds, put money in a range of assets. Their asset allocation aims to maximise expected returns for a given level of portfolio risk. The returns will depend on how much cash the chosen assets will pay out over the long term. Gold might be useful as a hedge, but it pays nothing; it just sits in the vault.


Hence Mr Brown’s decision. Unlike gold, the Bank’s foreign currency assets are interest-bearing. Eddie George, then governor of the Bank, argued in 1999 that “as a portfolio decision, it is perfectly sensible”. And he was right.
Yes, the Bank could have sold gold for a higher price by waiting — that’s the benefit of hindsight — but it is inappropriate for a central bank to be, in effect, taking a punt on commodity prices. Revealingly, George Osborne never instructed the Bank to sell dollars and euros and buy gold. If he’d done so, he would have been following the example of Hugo Chávez, who, as president of Venezuela after the global banking crisis of 2007 to 2009, made a huge bet on gold to free his country from “the dictatorship of the dollar”. The central bank of Venezuela stockpiled 70 per cent of its reserves in gold, a position that it’s now trying to unwind with gold prices around a third lower than their 2011 peak. With the domestic economy collapsing, Venezuela desperately needs foreign currency. Last week, the central bank sold $1 billion of its gold reserves through Citibank, that well-known revolutionary institution.


It’s the task of government and central bankers to deliver economic and financial stability so that consumers, businesses and investors can afford to take long-term decisions. Punting on gold has no place in that approach. Politicians of all parties should belatedly acknowledge that Mr Brown got that right.",null,0,null,1439743987,null,null,false,0,cu4yw55,null,t3_3h78eh,null,null,null,t1_cu4ytse,null,null,null,1441284717,null,11,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

* This one is just as much an indictment against Jose as it is against our current squad. The way we play in big games away is best characterized as ""afraid"". We are scared to concede, playing like a low-table side that wants to snatch a point, rather than as the champions who want to control the match. It invites pressure, and I would rather lose 3-0 by pressing for the win than sitting scared.

* We need more options in midfield. When Oscar is out, we are forced to play Ramires, who has been less than stellar.

* We should give Victor Moses a chance at RW. Honestly, at this point, why not?

Nothing else to add that hasn't already been said.

We used to have Schurrle, Mata and De Bruyne on the bench ffs. Today Zouma and Remy were the only subs who could hope to make a positive impact. We need higher quality depth.

Ramires can't be our go to man in the big games. He would struggle to make the bench on the elite teams that we are trying to emulate. I really think we need to sign a new centre mid.

It invites pressure, and I would rather lose 3-0 by pressing for the win than sitting scared.

Ramires is just not good enough for us or any other top 4 team. His touch is embarassing, can't shoot, can't pass, awful technically, can't even defend that well and leaves gaps all over our defence.

Ivanovic. Gets beaten with anyone with a bit of pace, gives away stupid fouls, isn't good offensively, can't cross and prone to lapses of concentration.

Fabregas is a liability defensively and we need another CDM to partner Matic.

Costa clearly doesn't look match sharp yet and his touch elts him down a lot. Hopefully he can stay fit and regain his form at the start of his Chelsea career

Costa was ineffective and dull.  He needs to work on his ball control.  He's really only good when he was space to run or when he can hit it first time. When someone is playing him tight he lost it every time.

Hazard didn't do a whole lot and it seems like every game now he's failing to convert a clear chance.

Fabregas was poor in attack and defense.  He shouldn't be taking set pieces, not one was successful.

Ivanovic is at fault for the second two goals... Shouldn't be overrun by Kompany and cheaply gave the ball away.

I'd cut straight to it by sending them an e-mail with a subject line ""Formal complaint re: account 12345"", and a message body that briefly explains your complaint. I'd also send them a cc of that e-mail to their postal address or fax (fax is nice because you get a little receipt).

Give it some time, and if they're not forthcoming with a decent solution (or even response) send them another e-mail &amp; letter, but this time as a *Notice Before Action*. It helps to keep your original e-mail and responses inline for posterity.

This second communication will outline your original complaint, what Virgin Media can do to immediately make you whole again, a copy of the documents you're using to support your complaint (and a request for documents they hold that are useful in justifying your own case), a 14-day ultimatum and notice that you will begin court proceedings.

By this time, I guarantee you they'll have sorted your problem out...

...if not though, you can now make a [money claim online](https://www.gov.uk/make-money-claim-online). It helps to have got your government ID etc. sorted out before hand, but it's essentially a case of just filling out your complain again in an online court document and hitting go. Simple as that, really.

Virgin Media will receive notice of you suing them, and will immediately fold.

Reviewing CCTV is often not going to show anything - bars/clubs are dark, and it takes a fraction of a second to spike a drink, and that could easily be missed. Not just that, but I don't think I ever met anyone who could be bothered sifting through 3+ hours of footage with enough diligence to come up with anything other than ""couldn't see anythin'"".

Now, if she was unresponsive and also 'foaming at the mouth', then I *seriously* doubt that doorstaff would dump her out onto such a busy street, outside a busy club, and the only people outraged about this were her friend and later, her mother. Other people would have witnessed this alleged treatment. The final thing is:
&gt; After fully investigating all CCTV footage, the police confirmed that our door stewards operated to a caring and professional standard towards the woman in question. First aid was administered and an ambulance was called within seven minutes of staff being alerted to the situation.

null,null,blueboyrob123,null,null,null,"Wow that was poor, without wanting to overreact I think the squad has a major issue.

Clearly JM doesn't trust our youth players, he rarely gives any of them game time, doesn't like them even training with the first team, so we have 0 rotation with our reserves.
Also, he clearly does not trust Mikel, Cuadrado, Remy, Moses, even Ramires, he loathes starting them and they get very little game time (Rightly so in my opinion, they're not good enough for a title winning side)

This leaves us with a team of 12/13 max, only real rotation is Ramires in for Oscar and Zouma sometimes in for Cahill. We just about got away with it last season after our blinding start, towards the end we looked jaded and out of ideas.

This season we've had very little investment, and too many of our core players look unfit, uninterested and potentially past it.
I thought Fabregas, Iva, Cahill, Hazard, JT and Costa all looked really real poor again today.
They all still clearly have a lot to offer, but without genuine improvements being made to the squad, we will go backwards as a team.

Man for Man we were massively outplayed today, and we simply did not have the bench to react to it.
I love Jose but he's made some really poor signings since he rejoined us, so many comings and goings yet the core of the team has remained unchanged, and right now we are miles away from City.

- Ivanovic doesn't offer enough at either end of the pitch. I would play Baba out left and Azpi on the right, Iva can be back up for RB/CB positions.

- I think we need to switch to a 4-3-3, losing the midfield battle too much.

- We need a mobile box to box midfielder that's mobile. Not sure who, Witsel would be good enough. Anyone else have any realistic suggestions? 

- Not enough creativity up top, a top right winger or no.10 is needed. In terms of who? Greizmann or Pedro would be a great addition that we need. Willian is good but not creative enough and Oscar is still inconsistent and he isn't a winger. Cuadrado and Moses are okay but not champions league winning team quality. Wouldn't mind one as back up but that would be it.

- We are far too narrow and slow in attack. Our wide players and current fullbacks always cut inside and I noticed City play a tactic often of the wide player holding onto the ball and then lays it onto the fullback, or visa versa. Either way we need to play wider to create more space, we can't keep hoping for set pieces or a magic moment from a player. 

Until we solve at least some of these issues it's gonna be a long season. The signs have been there for a long time, let's face it, this loss and performance weren't a shock.

null,null,steefen7,null,null,null,"My take:

* Taking Terry off didn't help. We looked disorganized and lacked concentration. The third goal was completely down to this and even the Kompany goal should not have happened

* Speaking of Ivanovic, he was awful today. Completely controlled by Sterling and got beat in his strongest area by Kompany which lost us the match. 

* Ramires is horrible, has been for years now, and does not deserve to be on this team. His touch is awful, his passing is even worse, and he does not have the kind of shooting ability to make up for either of these. I know Oscar was doubtful going into this game, but Mourinho likes this Ramires-for-Oscar move in big games which I simply don't understand. What would have helped most today is someone in the final third who could combine with Hazard and help us break down City to give Costa a chance.

* Cuadrado was barely better than Ramires, but I guess he could have been worse.

* Jose needs to rethink the way he approaches big matches like this. Playing like we did left us with no rhythm and no control. When we're playing well, we can muddle our way through games like this with good focus on defense. When the defense isn't focused or out of form, we lose 3-0. Not good enough. We are champions and should play like it. If you're worried we don't have the personnel to do this, see my third bullet and then buy some fucking players. 

* All this considered, fixing the Ivanovic issue may have knock-on effects that solve other issues. For instance, Fabregas and Willian both have to continually be drawn out of position to cover for Ivanovic. At times, Willian was actually RB and Ivanovic was a third CB. When we regain possession, our fastest player and our key midfielder are both out of position. Maybe solving this problem will wind up helping us be ready to maintain quality possession.

I disagree, the Nazis where elected for several reasons, Most importantly only Hitler promised to abolish the economic sanctions that had Germany poverty striken .

&gt;You are going to have to be much more specific.

In the 1920s it was much more easier to convince people of dogmatic ideas in the absence of evidence. In modern day its extremely difficult because we are much more informed. 

Listen to this speech by Hitler for example, He claims the Jews are a satanic power trying to take over Germany.

Basically if you are a practising academic who is not hard left, and have ever taken money from any of the major science funding foundations, you are a right wing shill. 


I'm not familiar with this Ropeik guy in particular, but can't disagree with his position that the hysterical overreaction to mad cow was a shining example of disproportional risk measurement. And his ""climate denial links"" look highly tenuous. (The irony of an anti-gmo campaigner dismissing others for having ""anti-science"" links is not lost here).

His wiki is here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ropeik for anyone interested.


&gt;The proponents of golden rice try to claim that significant numbers of people would be saved by arguing from data on vitamin A deficiency, ignoring that the amounts of precursor in golden rice mean that a normal human diet of it would not provide the necessary supplement. Even the inventor of the product acknowledges this. 


That is a highly misleading interpretation of that (15 year old) letter. This is the relevant line: 

""We want to provide rice, which has enough provitamin A, that it has a clear beneficial effect on vitamin A-deficient people - not 100% of the ""daily allowance"". Experienced nutritionalists tell us that this is a realistic goal with our approach, as we are, possibly, already in the 20-40% range of the daily allowance. (Using the Greenpeace argument for 100% would mean people would have to eat between 5-2.5 times 300 g of rice, which is 0.75 to 1.5 kg, not 9. Of course, our goal is to have an effect with 300 g).

Data to answer all these questions can now be produced, because we finally have solved the IPR/TPR problems which prevented, so far, handing out of Golden Rice seeds for field experiments. We are, of course, also working on an increase in provitamin A concentration, and there are several possibilities we are testing."" 

So he's actually saying ""Yes this is a limitation, and we would like to continue with the trials needed to improve things. But anti-GMO tossers have been stopping us.""

Low and behold, a couple years later they did solve it: http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n4/full/nbt1082.html

Are you also tied to a contract? What happens if you find yourself without work? How long can you afford to live without a job in your current position? I would at least want to cover rent for a month if I needed to find a new job.

[Here's his later view,](http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-08/doctor-who-a-woman-will-eventually-play-the-doctor-says-steven-moffat) and the same article refers to a quip he made in 2013 about Helen Mirren wanting a female Doctor, and that he wanted a male Queen.

Moffatt cast Matt Smith and Capaldi, and if he had wanted a woman either time, he would have cast one.

I think he feels it's ok in-uninverse, especially in having a female Master. However he feels its not appropriate currently, for other reasons.

I'm by no means an expert on Russian football, but there are big names there who might add depth (Danny, Criscito, Hulk, Garay maybe?). Why we aren't pushing harder for Pedro is beyond me, and Stones is a risk we should be taking. There are good players out there, whom would add greater depth to the squad, and it's not like we lack the funds. Roma must be nearing the bottom of their piggy back, why not throw a cheeky bid in for Pjanic? Or Florenzi? Include Salah in the deal as a make weight. And if Real are after Kovacic, someone needs to make room, so why not monitor that too?

&gt;Its hard to improve the team, they just need motivated 

And it isn't hard to improve the team. We lack quality in depth. Cuadrado had been nothing short of woeful, and I don't buy into that ""he hasn't had a chance"" argument because when he had played, he's shown no sign of deserving anything. Mikel and Ramires are two of the most one-dimensional players I've ever seen, and offer very little to the squad as a whole. I'm not saying they are bad players, I'm just saying there are options out there that can offer exactly the same as those two and more. And defensively we are as weak as we've been in years. Cahill is not of sufficient quality, and Ivanovic has been defensively poor for longer than we should've accepted. Yes, he scored goals last season but we need to look at the bigger picture. Take away the goals, and was he defensively solid? No. Did he leave us exposed? Yes. Did we care? Not when we were winning...and when the winning stops, that's when the frailties become obvious.

I really fell for 10 though and I had watched his regeneration before, but again, out-of-sequence. So when it looked like his time was coming I stopped watching and started over with 9. The second time around I watched through the regeneration and felt like I'd lost a best friend. I cried. I really felt brokenhearted. 11 was okay. Not my favorite by any means, though he was good. His portion felt more like it was returning to the children's show it was intended to be. I've only seen a couple of 12's  episodes and his seems to be centered around prat falls and physical comedy.

People like Wenger, Mou -- they're all about football.  That's well and good, but I think it fair to say we've always liked personalities.

Bilic is a personality.  Speaks like five languages, a trained lawyer, part time rock star, and is a rather successful manager to boot so far in his career.

I think realistically, we're going to finish comfortably in mid-table this season -- somewhere between 8 and 13 or so.  Bilic knew Wenger already -- he knew how Wenger likes to play, and even studied under the man for a while when he was getting started as a manager himself.  That being said, he's still new to the Premier League, and though tapes and recorded games will help to an extent, he's still got to learn how to handle other managers and squads.

Don't take anything away from him though -- because he had the presence of mind to realize we were getting fucked up and changed things sufficiently at the half that we were able to start putting pressure on Leicester.  I think it fair to say that if we'd been playing the entire match the way we had in the second half, the outcome might have been very, very different.  Bilic recognized that he made a bad call, and made efforts to fix it.  Zarate started hugging the left touchline more and denied that space to Leicester, and Jenkinson started pressing more (or at least, more effectively) in the second half as well. 

Sam would not have considered the possibility that his tactics were flawed.

A decent sized casserole dish; equally good for casserole, roasting, crumble. A Tuscan oven is even better.


Make sure she knows how to make a good crumble. For some reason, it's one of the most impressive skills when you're in shared accomodation.


Make sure she has a big roll of freezer bags. They're handy for a ridiculous number of things.


Wouldn't bother with the pizza slicer; no-one ever uses them. Delivered pizza is ridiculously cheap, and homemade pizza is much easier to cut with large kitchen scissors than with a pizza slicer.


Make sure she has a large pair of quality kitchen scissors (and knows to hide them!)


Send her a Tesco delivery of essential food items every once in a while. You can't *imagine* how much this lifts the spirits. It's incredible.


One thing my mum did for me, which made my first month much better, was give me 30 wrapped presents (they were small, fitting into a shoe box), of which I was allowed to open one every day. They were things like a packet of cup a soup, a WHSmith voucher, supernoodles, cinema gift voucher, chilli con carne sauce mix, shampoo...lots of really small things which made me feel so, so much less alone and unable to cope for that first month while I was settling in.


She may well spend more than she has and find herself in monetary difficulties; please try not to be angry. It's very difficult being released out into the world not knowing all the adult skills for things like managing money, and suddenly being able to do or have what you want is a heady experience. NB: being told to be good with money, not to spend too much etc *does not help* someone learn how to be good with it. This is something that you have to sit down with them and teach them. And some of it they are only going to find out by fucking up anyway.

Maybe make a little buffer so that if she does mess up, you can bail her out without making her feel like crap about it. **But** don't bail her out every time; she won't learn to not do it otherwise.

Also that guy doesn't even know what a carry trade is. In fact it's comical how wrong he's gotten it. A carry trade is simply borrowing in a low yielding currency (eg currently Euros) and buying a high yielding currency (Eg Brazilian Reais). You then pocket the yield differential. Of course you're also exposed to the currency then which is were people get into trouble. 

At no point do you borrow in 'gold' and invest in higher yielding currencies. That's not even possible and to further illustrate how daft that journalist is the Yen is pretty much the definition of a low yielding currency and is commonly used to fund carry trades.

Communism is inherently against freedom and serves to move power into a few hands as the current rulers consolidate power^2. Giving communists every political freedom in a society when it stands against everything the west is built on is never the right decision. 

I'm not really that interested in debating communism but the fact is all communist soceities have been un-democratic and most murderous. My point again is you shouldn't attack people who are marching because of their ideology or the same is easily justified for communism.

EDIT 2: ^1 By this I mean single party rule
            ^2 Due to there being no free media in most communist states its easy for the government to control most information (and consolidate power)

Mate stop phrasing this as if all it is a mere difference of opinion. It's not an intellectual debate or dialectical chin-wag where everything resides solely in the mind of the believer, where we can discuss the merits and flaws of fascism without any effect on real life. Beliefs guide behaviour. Nazism is not just opinion; it is political action. These activists are protesting because they believe in the righteousness of their cause. The cause of the white man. They are taking to the streets to let the world know. You do not fight action with words alone.  You need the intellectual rigour, certainly, to expose their beliefs as the petty-minded bigotry of impotent xenophobia.

Ivanovic. Gets beaten with anyone with a bit of pace, gives away stupid fouls, isn't good offensively, can't cross and prone to lapses of concentration.

Fabregas is a liability defensively and we need another CDM to partner Matic.

We all know how Diego plays, however it's extremely hard to fight for possession and pester the defense when you're appealing for every contact you feel is a foul. Play to the whistle, not to the foul.

- Ivanovic lacked speed and defensive ability

As /u/Baisabeast said, brana is easily beaten by a bit of pace and his mistakes in the bottom third lead to pointless fouls and avoidable goals. He's lacked the attacking prowess that fullbacks normally have. He needs to be better or we are going to have more than a few points dropped this year.

- Mourinho's poor substitutions

Now while I did notice that Falcao and Cuardrado weren't horrible today, they weren't the players we needed to pull the game back. Moses proved himself in preseason and Remy last season.

1) Fabregas with Matic just isn't working out. We need another solid CDM. Honestly expected Zouma to start today. Wasn't surprised when Terry was subbed off. 

2) Ramires. How is he still starting? I honestly think we should give either Moses or Cuadrado more game time than Ramires. Shocking starting 11 selection today! 

3) Hazard cannot be expected to do anything on his own. There were some moments where we got close with Hazard, but then again, without the right support, it just isn't possible.

4) Costa was poor as well today. Even in pre-season, his finishing was off and he just wasn't the same beast he was back this time last year.

5) Begovic is a fantastic back up. We have made the right choice in buying him!

Mourinho is not vey versatile in terms of coaching attacks. He knows exactly three things about attack: fast counterattack, hold up striker and set pieces, but we don't have the right personnel for fast counterattack or hold up striker. Since the second half of last season, our attack hasn't been much better than a lot of lesser teams, not to mention top teams in the league and Europe. In this game, Man City's attack made ours look like amateur. Sure, they have better talent in attack, but the difference in talents is not as big as the performance would've suggested. Mourinho is simply not good enough at engineering attack plays with these plays he has.
This is not necessarily an understatement but rather fact. We have to purchase the right talent for Mourinho to play to his strength. We can't afford not to buy any attacking players if Chelsea aim to compete domestically or in Europe.
As for defense, the problems are pretty obvious. That's Jose's strong suit and I believe he can sort out defense in time.

In that situation the central bank would be trying to fight inflation with interest rates while simultaneously pumping freshly printed money into the economy via government. You'd effectively be starving the private sector while boosting the public.

It entirely depends I think on how much you trust politicians with that kind of power because make no mistake what I've just described, financing a deficit with printed money is exactly how hyperinflation has typically begun. And the thing with hyperinflation is, in the early years things  look fantastic, which strengthens the hand of the politicians in power, it's only later when things get out of control that you find solving it is a much bigger problem than you had in the first place.

Willian isn't a winger so he drifts inward naturally - so he doesn't create enough width. Unlike players who naturally hug the touch line more. This forces the defending team to come out wide which naturally creates space. I'm saying Willian isn't creative enough (because he isn't a winger and is being asked to defend too much to help cover Ivanovic). If you purchase a right winger, say Pedro, then have Moses as back up for that position, then Oscar and Willian can compete for the number 10 role. Playing Aspi at RB would free up whoever plays right wing regardless as he is superior defensively to Ivanovic.

I hope that clears things up!

^^^trust ^^^me ^^^guys ^^^I've ^^^won ^^^the ^^^title ^^^with ^^^Chelsea ^^^16 ^^^times ^^^in ^^^18 ^^^years

This post match analysis from Sky is pissing me off so let me explain this to Souness and Quinn.

John Terry can not play in a high line. He has absolutely no pace if the ball gets played in behind him he will not get goal side against Heskey never mind Aguero.

We seen it happen under Villas-Boas when he tried to split the centre backs and play a high line, we looked incompetent in defence. We seen it against Swansea when we tried to push too high up.

We had to push higher up the pitch to press City and to recycle possession which worked when Zouma came on, we had them pegged back for quite a while in their own half.

**Centre:**
Fabregas needs to sort his positioning out. He needs to sit deep along side Matic when attacking and defending for when we run into corners and dead ends so the ball can be passed back to him for him to switch it to the other side.

**Left:**
The complete lack of width in the first half, which is a result of playing Terry in defence as Terry can't play a high line. If Dave pushes forward to add width to the attack Terry is by himself on the left side of defence and if we lose the ball with Dave high up the pitch all they have to do is play the ball down the wing enough times and Navas will create chances through his pace and crossing. That's our problem on the left side.

**Right:**

Ivanovic, I fucking love this dude but he can't defend against pace for shit. Jose loves the Ram and so do I but considering we signed him as a right winger he doesn't do well there (Still better than Cuadrado). The Ram always drifts inside which is a problem because we already have Fabregas who pushes up too far when we already have Willian there. We don't have a player on the right who can cross a ball to save their life which isn't really a problem if we have width on both sides but right now we don't.

**Fixes:**

Luckily most of our problems can be sorted out with players we have. When Oscar is fit he plays in the middle which pushes Willian out on the right and that's the width on the right sorted. With Oscar in the middle Fabregas doesn't have to create as much because Oscar can do it while Willian can't.

If Fabregas can't sort out his positioning we can bring Mikel in until he can. I know a lot of people shit on Mikel for his passing  but I don't have a problem with it if we are in control of a game because all he has to do is ensure he's on the side of the pitch where the ball is and if the ball comes back to him he passes it to Matic who can play it wide.

The last problem is Terry's lack of pace and sadly this can only be solved by either switching him for Zouma or playing Oscar in the centre who will do most of Fabregas's work for him.

Anyway, these are my thoughts and I'm open to discussion as I'm more than likely wrong on a few things, would love to hear your thoughts.",null,0,null,1439748812,null,null,false,0,cu51l45,null,t3_3h7w2v,null,null,null,t3_3h7w2v,null,null,null,1441286053,null,47,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,47,null

Since February time the odd performance may stand out, but there has not been consistent run of games where we've won impressively.

What's happened so far this season is a combination of our criminal lack of meaningful transfer activity, the huge drop in form of key players like Fabregas, Costa and Iva, the big improvements made by rival sides and our appalling strength in depth.

We need real injections of quality players, this isn't me playing fantasy football, but we need a LB, CB, CM and attacking player that will improve our first 11, not more squad players who Jose is only half interested in.

I remember when Andre was there he would never track back, leaving us more open on defense but looking very potent on the counter attack. William will track back and has great pace no doubt. But.  You can't really expect any player to run box to box all game in defense and attack and be 100 percent in his crosses and taking on people. 

I think a reason we haven't been able to find a real right winger that has the impact that hazard has is due to the mindset those wingers have to have with Branna being in the back 4.

We knew last season Schneiderlin &amp; Wanyama were a beast midfield partnership, and Clasie is our Schneiderlin replacement but is injured.  

Maybe he'll come in and we'll look more solid. He's not as physical as Schneiderlin but he does like to cover the back 4, so hopefully his defensive positioning and understanding of the game means he'll manage the interceptions and tackles Schneiderlin used to. A good few people I've spoken to about Clasie say he's best in front of the back 4, with a bit less box-to-box than Schneiderlin, but that his timing in the tackle and his work rate is excellent.  

After the end of the window (by which time we'll have played 4 more games) I'll give a proper review of what I think our business has achieved and how it's looking, but even then I'll wait until a few more games in to decide. A lot of us would often say Mané is our biggest attacking threat, yet for the start of last season he looked worryingly useless (much like Saturday in fact).  

Let's wait and see for now. I'm more concerned about the appalling performance and poor choice of tactics/player selection than the window right now. At least give the players a chance to come good. In pre-season, while there was the odd sign, we generally looked very good - it's the lack of change to adapt to the PL opposition that's worrying me.

On what basis do you make that position on? As I said, don't mistake your own personal views for the views of the public, just because that's all you hear in the echo-chamber.

&gt;NATO? Yes again just fine without it. There is a credible argument for leaving that would be popular with the electorate.

Again, you're hearing the echo-chamber repeat your own views back to you and you're mistakenly believing that this is the view of the public at large. What on earth makes you believe that enough of the public actively wants out of NATO to the extent that Corbyn will be on a winning platform with that view?

Where on earth are you getting this? He has been an MP in a safe seat for the last few decades and not much else. Maybe in the ""we love JC"" circlejerk you could make a very convoluted argument that his strength is foreign relations, but the only reason it won't be picked to pieces is that circlejerks exist to agree with everything you say.

*The Bicentennial Man and other stories* by Isaac Asimov - I say this every time I read something by Asimov: his prose is a bit uninspiring, but his ideas are so good they more than make up for it.

*Death Comes to Pemberly* by P. D. James - A bit predicable, I thought, but very fun.

*Great Expectations* by Charles Dickens - Another one of those books that's been so extensively read and studied, there's really nothing new for me to add to the conversation.

*The Reader* by Bernard Schlink - I liked it. It has that very direct language that translations from German always have, funny how you can always recognise that.

I'm almost at the end of *The Return of Sherlock Holmes* by Arthur Conan Doyle - It kind of shows that Conan Doyle wasn't really interested in his own creation any more; it's not his best work.

Not necessarily my favourite, but I recommend *White Teeth* by Zadie Smith or *The Blind Assassin* by Margaret Atwood for your bookclub.

Was the proprty furnished or unfurnished when you moved in?

Your landlord has to make sure that your home is free from infestation when the tenancy begins however disrepairs as a result of poor design are generally not the landlords responsibility (as you mentioned damp construction materials in new homes)

If you feel like your health is being affected then you can call your local council and talk to the team that deals with the private rented sector. They may decide if the infestation is serious enough that they will make your landlord fix the problem else face a fine. This is probably your best option.

It's unlikely you'll be able to break from your agreement early. 

If you've contacted your landlord/agent and are not satisfied with the response or they are not responding at all you can make a disrepair claim through small claims court however infestation with bugs/parasites can be very difficult to prove (especially if unfurnished when you moved in and no previous tenant - it would strongly suggest the problem was one you caused) Again the court will not let you break the agreement early but may make a judgement for specific repairs.

In 1920s Germany, for instance, they had to pay reparations in foreign currency (having run out of gold), resulting in a flood of German marks on the market. So they rapidly devalued, but Germany had no choice but to keep buying foreign currency (or become insolvent). So they kept printing more and more money to pay for it.

And in another famous case, [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform_in_Zimbabwe#Economic_consequences) destroyed their own agricultural output through rapid land reform and their economy suffered greatly as a result:

&gt;As the primary beneficiaries of the land reform were members of the Government and their families, despite the fact that most had no experience in running a farm, the drop in total farm output has been tremendous and has even produced starvation and famine, according to aid agencies.

They also had to endure economic sanctions:

&gt;Where there was a trade surplus of $322 million in 2001, in 2002 the credit freeze led to a trade deficit of $18 million, to grow rapidly in subsequent years.

null,null,xbshooter,null,null,null,"I like this thread, constructive realistic criticism without being nothing but ""negative"". With that I'd like to add my thoughts on the game today.

Game today: Begovic is the only reason we're not all crying from a 7-0 defeat. He was remarkable today! 

In defense, Terry is amazing but has got to establish the backbone and leadership that he is known for in getting the boys organized and prevent us from getting caught out of position every other attack. Ivanovic was absolutely lousy and I singled handedly blame him for goals 2 and 3, I know it's a team sport, but if Zouma is in either of those positions that he was in, I believe we would not have conceded either goal. Cahill was not single handedly responsible for the first goal, but I believe he was poor and I've always thought he was poor, last year he had the consistent problem of backing up all the way to the 6 yard box and then the other team would shoot and score and he would look dumbfounded, he needs to be benched. Azpi was solid as usual and Zouma I feel is one of our best defenders! 

In midfield, WHY IN THE FUCK DID WE START RAMIREZ? Better yet, why is he not our 3rd or 4th choice? I'd much rather see 1.Oscar 2.Mikel or 3.Zouma before I EVER want to see Ramirez starting. Matic is a boss Fabregas is a boss, they need a strong 3rd to go with them, Oscar can be it but in strong physical matches we need another wolf hunter. On the wings Willian is a very hard worker but a non-factor when it comes to offense, he is absolutely predictable he either 1. Dribles to goal line and crosses to nobody 2. Passes to Ivanovic who kicks it into the first defender or completely over the entire 18. Can anyone remember the last time he shot at goal? I know he scored last week but that was a cross that took a deflection. Today we had 3 FUCKING SHOTS ON GOAL ALLL GOD DAMN GAME! That is absolutely pathetic! (Get the downvotes ready) Hazard is by far our best player, to our team he is irreplaceable, but in my opinion he is not even in the  fucking top 20 best players in the world and he sure as shit isn't 3rd best behind ronaldo and messi. If you look at his 2 chances he had today and take the actual top 20 best players in the world I bet 20/20 of them finish at least one of those and probably 10/20 score both of them. Bottom line he needs help on offense and right now he is alone.

Anddddddddd that is because offense,

Diego Costa is injured, why are we playing an injured player? If you stick Lukaku in for Costa today he scores at least once and if he played like he did against south Hampton yesterday he scores 2. ON TOP OF THAT last year he was a warrior, this year he is a blubbering vagina of a pussy, bitching literally every time he gets the ball taken away. Did he get neutered over the summer? I want a fucking warrior up top in a formation that only has one striker and instead we have a bleeding vagina, and Falcao is not the answer, im calling it now, he will score less for us than he did for united last year. Remy (right now only) is our best option...which is sad for a previous premier League winning club.

In summary, 1. we absolutely need a striker 2. We absolutely need another midfielder 3. Both of them need to be warriors not prima Donna baby back bitches.

We just signed Rahman, and if we sign Stones, I think we are only one good right-back (to challenge Ivanovic, who has aged five years in the last two months) and one good central midfielder (to challenge Fabregas) away from retaining the title.

When I was between homes (the second time) a lovely lady at my Uni spent forty minutes in the phone and suddenly a man arrived with a set of keys to a student house they operated. Although I was still a student weirder things have happened. 

I'd also consider contacting any professors you held a good relationship with, they might know industry people who could use a cheap skivvy and ask around. Once you've got a degree related job you should be fine.

If you have any possessions that are super
personal then ask around friends (ideally those with attic spaces!), pack into as small a box as possible (limit your impact!) and get them out of the house asap. During any difficult days ahead knowing those things are safe will be reassuring. Sell/get rid of everything you don't need. Take a couple of hours to do it, a physical job such as this can be therapeutic.

If things can't be patched up then bury the the past, don't let it rest on your mind. Close that chapter and move on, don't bottle up the feelings (seek help if needed) but be prepared to just let go. 

Most importantly: don't feel bad for needing help, feel reassured it is there.

He is one of the best tacklers out there, is very hard to push of the ball, and has a good pass, shot and technique. His only downside is probably that he tries to play it too safe sometimes.  
  
In many ways he's very similar to Matic, but could offer more offensive drive while still being defensively solid. Ideally he would play together with Matic in midfield allowing Fabregas to move a place forward, so he can completely focus on offense, which he's doing already anyway the last couple games.

You seem to be assuming that there is overwhelming and strong support for these things and that people couldn't possibly change their minds on those issues. Given that there has been no public debate on these issues (aside from trident in Scotland) for well over a generation that's quite an assumption, the world has changed since the 1980's. If people thought their lives would be no different with or without these things they wouldn't hinder Labour's ability to be elected. Trident and NATO are not going to be the things that prevent a Corbyn led Labour party to win office it will perceptions on things that actually effect people's day to day lives.

On trident there are [several polls which would suggest the opposite](http://cnduk.org/campaigns/no-to-trident/opinion-polls). Don't get me wrong you will find plenty of polls that will show support for trident but you cannot make out it is a settled matter that is not subject to change. Personally I imagine a lot of polls regarding Trident have leading questions (from both sides) and given most people are relatively uneducated on the specifics are not a particularly good way of predicting how the public may feel after more thorough examination of the arguments for and against. One thing I would point out though is that opposition to Trident is much greater in Scotland, where it is occasionally a topic of debate, than in the rest of the UK where it is something which barely anyone gives any thought to.

Willian-Ivanovic seems to be set up as a way to cover up of each other's weaknesses rather than an actual attacking threat.

A lot of the time last season we had Schurrle come on late or start matches to provide the extra attacking on the other wing from Hazard. One of the main reasons why we were such an attacking force in the first half of the last season was simply because we had an extra option to attack when required. This was essentially over when Schurrle was sold in Jan window and our play shifted to one dimensional attack from the right and it worsened with Oscar's dip in form.

null,null,ModestTurtle,null,null,null,"I think what Moffat has been doing, possibly unknowingly, is 'dumbing down' Doctor Who. The show when it came back was quite niche until it broke out on BBC America and got a shiney new look in the UK - the show now more than ever is trying to appeal to children. When Russell T Davis was head showrunner the narratives were written in a very adult way; he wrote shows like Torchwood, that were aimed directly at adults and that directly linked with Doctor Who. Now after Moffat has taken over, I feel the BBC has pushed for an increase in ratings and Moffat is trying to solve this by appealing to kids, appealing to the more general public who don't care for complex narrative and just want a good sci-fi show and to try and rebrand the show as less niche and 'nerdy'.

Personally I hate this and much prefered the show when Davis was head showrunner and the narratives were more adult, at least in characterisation and dialogue - I liked when the show was more niche and the BBC was less concerned about appealing to everyone and just more bothered about making the best show possible, not to say Moffat isn't trying, he clearly can write very well, Sherlock is an example of that, I just think its more an executive decision for the show to be more basic.

I too cringed when I heard the line and have been all throughout series 8 - I think Capaldi is amazingly talented and always makes the best of what the writing makes him have to deal with. I dont think Capaldi needs Russell T Davis, but just someone fresh, someone who can write sci-fi and someone who knows how to create complex narratives whilst not alienating groups, which is extremely hard in TV, but the BBC is certainly capable of finding fantastic writers, evident by some of the other shows they have produced in the past.

I think we are probably quibbling over a very fine distinction, but he has said more recently, about the Doctor being neither wholly male nor female (like all of us).

He said this in mid 2013:
&gt;[“I didn't feel enough people wanted it,” he said, according to The Telegraph. “Oddly enough, most people who said they were dead against it -- and I know I’ll get into trouble for saying this -- were women, saying, 'No, no, don’t make him a woman.'""
&gt;This isn't the first time the ""Doctor Who"" woman question has been addressed. In a recent interview with IMDb, Moffat admitted that a female Doctor wasn't in the cards.
&gt;""I don’t think that would be a sensible thing to do, no,"" Moffat said when asked if the casting could be gender-blind. ""I think you’d have to make a decision on the gender before you approached it.""](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/07/new-doctor-who-woman-steven-moffat_n_3718623.html)

null,null,istillfeelyou,rangers,,null,"Listen pal, I've worked for myself. I've also done quite a bit of research on this and you're opening up a can of worms for everyone if what you said was true although it's not.

First and foremost the SFA consulted independent solicitors and they ruled that it was the same club. FIFA and UEFA both back this up as do advertising standards who would slaughter them if they falsely claimed to be something they're not. Even if you want to equate the club and company the old one still trades to pay debts even now. Legally speaking you have no grounds for what you're saying. There has to be quite a vast conspiracy going on if their assessments are wrong. Assessments that have not been challenged in the courts. 

Secondly, as I've said I do freelance work and have worked for both a private members club *and* small businesses. I have yet to see that box to tick when I'm sending off tax or if I'm setting myself up that says ""football club"". The same goes for my boss or past accountants. I'll ask. There may be a tax break in there for us! That's because in the same way the SFA is not the limited company that takes care of the business aspects and not the members club so too were/are Rangers, Hibs et all. That's the whole point of limited companies whether publicly listed or no - they spread risk and take liability away from individuals and place it on a business entity. This is why you'll often see golf and bowling clubs and indeed students' unions operating under a parent company. There has been cases where individual members of social clubs and so on have been liable to pay tax because they did not set up a parent company to take care of finances. HMRC and Rangers creditors did not chase Rangers Football Club. They chased the parent company with one very important addendum at the end - publicly limited company.

A publicly limited company that did not exist until 1899 if memory serves. Rangers Football Club was founded in 1872. [Edit: Actually it was just a limited company in 1899 it wasn't publicly traded until...2001 I believe with Murray.]

I'm on my phone so I can't easily copy and paste all the data but you can verify this yourself...

Let's say you're right. Let's say that the business entity is the football club. Whoever that may be. That means that Rangers were really founded in 1899 when a ***new*** entity was created just as it was with the newco. Hibs, Hearts and Aberdeen were incorporated around the same time. Celtic of course took until the 90s to become a PLC but were a business entity around the same time as the others way back. Dundee United were incorporated 2 years after the club was founded. The list goes on. If the business such as the new Rangers PLC is in effect (and your mind) a separate and new entity then so too are the clubs past who transferred their histories in the same manner Rangers did. For the traditional sides this cuts around 30-40 years of history off for teams like Hearts.

Of course this isn't actually true because all of these football clubs were and are entirely separate from their holding companies.

The truth is what the facts and evidence actually support not what you wish it to be out of ill feeling towards a football club.

Otherwise there's a pretty big conspiracy at play and you'd do well to report it to the authorities.


**ADDENDUM**

I found the landmark advertising standards ruling that pretty much lists every form of legal evidence, the rulings of UEFA, the SFA and their independent legal consults I mentioned above.

I fully expect an argument against their rulings and why Advertising Standards would operate in a partisan manner on behalf of Rangers Football Club.

----

&gt; Whilst the ASA acknowledged that Newco had not taken on all of the debts and liabilities of Oldco when it purchased its assets and that that would normally preclude a business from trading on the reputation of a liquidated predecessor company, we noted, having read its report in full, that both an Independent Commission appointed by the SPL and the ECA had reached the conclusion that the football club RFC was a recognisable entity in its own right, and that it had continued in existence despite being transferred to another owner and operator. We consulted with UEFA, which explained that its rules allowed for the recognition of the “sporting continuity” of a club’s match record, even if that club’s corporate structure had changed. We also consulted with the SFA, which confirmed that its definition of a football “club” varied depending on context, and could sometimes refer to an entity separate from the club’s corporate owner. The SFA further pointed out that, following RFC’s transfer to a new corporate owner, Newco did not take a new membership of the Scottish FA but rather that the previous membership was transferred across to them so they could continue as the same member of the Scottish FA. We considered that consumers would understand that the claim in question related to the football club rather than to its owner and operator and we therefore concluded that it was not misleading for the ad to make reference to RFC's history, which was separate to that of Newco.

null,null,Definitely_Not_Salty,null,null,null,"His positioning just leaves a big hole in an already weak right side. Hopefully it'll be solved by Dave being switched back to the right.

The thing is that the Ram is unreliable on the break. The odd time he'll do something god like similar to what he did to City a few seasons ago and score or like lobbing Valdez from 25 yards.

Most of the time however, he'll have the touch as delicate as a pedophile and the ball will end up 50 yards ahead of him. Add to that the fact his passing is extremely unreliable, he really needs to work on his control of the ball mainly his dribbling and passing. I think it's gotten bad through being re-trained as a defensive midfielder, people forget that when we signed Ramires he was a right winger, a pretty good one at that.

The Ram, as much as I love him is a poor mix of Mikel and Essien. He has the passing and ability to win the ball back of Mikel while being everywhere when played in the centre and make stupid decisions like Essien.

It's like sex in a hot tub, it might sound good but at the end of the day it just doesn't work.

In order for the Ram to be back to his old self, he needs to play as an attacking centre midfielder in a 4-3-3, this is when he was at his best for us in my opinion/ Unfortunately we don't play it anymore. We've yet to find a new role for him since we changed from 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1.

It would be interesting to see him play as a right back or in big games in the champions league,  the role of Oscar (minus the creativity) to break up play and win the ball back high up the pitch.",null,0,null,1439755122,null,null,false,0,cu5532b,null,t3_3h7w2v,null,null,null,t1_cu54b3y,null,null,null,1441287723,null,4,null,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4,null

-------

I *get* that people don't really want to be seeing cops with guns just walking about **but** I really wish the whole issue wasn't ratcheted to 11 on that back of that. The facts are we have hundreds of highly trained, highly equipped, highly prepared officers sitting about responding to *1* crime per day. Not each, between the all of them. Just under 50% of those crimes don't even involve a real gun.

Cutting the number of officers doesn't seem like a great idea, we already have fewer than other places despite the inherent inefficiency in service delivery in Scotland. Maybe they could keep the gun in the car, maybe there are perfectly good reasons why they can't do that.

null,null,theinspectorst,null,null,null,"I think the other interesting possible historical parallel with that period is between the role of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in the 2010-15 Coalition and that of Ramsay MacDonald and Labour in the 1931-35 National Government - i.e. the leader of the up-and-coming third party entering a controversial coalition with the Tories during a time of economic instability. In both cases, this set the party back hugely in the short-term; but in Labour's case it lay the groundwork to rebuild as a serious party of government not protest, as Lib Dem supporters today will similarly hope to do in the coming years (particularly if Labour now swings hard leftwards with Corbyn).

MacDonald was the first Labour prime minister, initially leading minority governments for a few months in 1924 and again between 1929 and 1931, before forming the majority National Government in 1931. Although MacDonald was the National Government's prime minister, a huge majority of its MPs and a majority of the cabinet were Tories, and the key domestic policy roles were held by Tories (Baldwin as Lord President and effectively in charge, Chamberlain as Chancellor) - so the analogy with Clegg's position in the Coalition sort of works.

The National Government presided over spending cuts that were hugely controversial among Labour supporters at the time - even significantly more so than the Coalition's cuts were among Lib Dems. Labour actually expelled MacDonald and his supporters from the party after the government was formed and his name was a dirty word among Labour supporters for decades. It also cost Labour badly in the short term, losing 4/5ths of their seats (including that of their new leader Arthur Henderson) in the 1931 election after the National Government was formed.

However, later generations [recognised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald#Reputation) MacDonald's role in the sorts of terms that Cleggites today would no doubt self-identify with:

&gt;[David Marquand] argued also to place MacDonald's fateful decision in 1931 in the context of the crisis of the times and the limited choices open to him. Marquand praised the prime minister's decision to place national interests before that of party in 1931. He also emphasised MacDonald's [...] pivotal role in transforming Labour from an outside protest group to an inside party of government.",null,0,null,1439755990,null,null,false,0,cu55kjw,null,t3_3h7w0v,null,null,null,t3_3h7w0v,null,null,null,1441287952,null,2,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null
