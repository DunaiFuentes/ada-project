null,false,wherearemyfeet,null,null,null,"&gt; If every hospital in the country were sold off I get the impression you would still claim the NHS wasn't being privatised.

No. Because that would literally be privatisation. But they're not being sold off. So it isn't.

What they're trying to claim is subcontracting some one-off or limited work to private firms as-and-when is all of a sudden privatisation, despite the fact that it's something that's happened ever since the NHS started. It wasn't privatisation when it happened under the Labour government. It wasn't privatisation under *any* government in the last six decades. But suddenly, because it suits a narrative, it's being billed as privatisation and people are buying it without question. It's a bit stupid, frankly.

&gt;No one thinks or is claiming the entire NHS must have been sold off since BUPA exists.

You cited Virgin Health in response to me earlier on. I assume you forgot this?

&gt;That among other statements make your replies so greasily disingenuous that they are unpleasant to read.

If you don't like people disagreeing with you, don't read my replies.

&gt;Given the well oiled deployment of such techniques in your other comments I can only imagine you must get accused of shill-dom a lot.

If anyone is so hugely egotistical and full of a sense of self-importance, as well as hugely paranoid to the point that they really need to see a doctor, that the only reason they think someone would only disagree with them is because they are some sort of paid secret agent sent by the Government to argue with them on Reddit, then they're a bit of an idiot, to put it mildly.",null,0,null,1436983956,null,0,1436984335,0,ct4ejf8,null,t3_3d8n3o,null,t1_ct4ejf8,null,t1_ct4cp71,null,null,null,1437877026,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,MyreMyalar,null,null,null,"The reason Corbyn is probably pulling ahead is because of the paucity of the other candidates. I'm a labour member and I don't honestly believe _any_ of the candidates will win at a general election; why?

- The SNP have taken Scotland, Lib Dems collapsed and the Tories will have fixed the boundries in England in their favour. In practice this will make it impossible for any bog standard centre left leader hovering somewhere between the Greens, SNP &amp; Tories to win on their own. Liz Kendall might win a handfull of extra southerners in the home countries and Andy Burnham might scrape a handful more seats in Northern/Midland former Labour areas but none of that will be enough to make a Labour majority even if a centre left leader could somehow round up the Green &amp; leftish former Lib Dem voters.

- The only way to break out of this trap in 2020 was to elect a populist candidate that might have had personal appeal beyond political calculations. Nobody that ended up standing has much of a compelling back story, none of them have obvious breakout charisma and none of them has outlined any obvious grand vision for the future.

So Labour members are likely thinking, we could waste five years watching one of these two Miliband-rebrands reach the inevitable conclusion, or suffer five years of Kendall trying to outmanoeuvre Cameron on the right so she can look smug about it in the Tabloids. Or... we could watch Corbyn and see what the fuck he does, because for all the 'back to the 80's' talk, 90's style labour hasn't really been doing much for the past two elections. Yes, Corbyn is too old and not especially charismatic but at least he doesn't seem to wake up and dial a focus group to find out what he's supposed to think today. It might be interesting to have an actual fucking fight for a change. Won't win the election but since that wasn't really in the offing anyway, perhaps Labour could shift the Overton window instead. Instead of talking about exactly how large the shaft should be that we are shoving up the poor, and exactly how fast we should privatise anything that's still left we might have a parliamentary debate about whether we should do those things at all.

&gt;French TV is no more dire than the BBC. 

What a load of bollocks.

1. BBC does not have endless adverts as the French stations do (tv and radio). 

2. The BBC broadcasts (by itself) far more radio and tv stations than all of the French stations put together -i.e. more choice. 

3. There is a reason why French radio has a bad reputaion in Europe. Hint it is terrible. 

4. BBC creates TV content that is watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world, such as BBC Earth, Top gear, Doctor Who, louis theroux and many many more. Please name some French TV that is watched outside of France.

5. French news services are a lot more pro government than the BBC. The BBC employs more journalists in more countries than any other news network. I know BBC news is not perfect, but it is the trusted source for many people around the world, this is something that we need to protect it also creates 'soft power' that is incalculable. 

I could go on, but I get the feeling you are incredibly biased toward French TV if you think the only difference is 'the voice'.

Working from an assumption that your property costs ¬£200,000:

Minimum 10% deposit (maybe less if you qualify for a first time buyers mortgage) = ¬£20,000

Stamp Duty = ¬£1500 (You can calculate this here : [http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/stamp-duty]http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/stamp-duty)

Solicitors Fees ~ ¬£1000

Mortgage Arrangement Fees ~ ¬£1000 (Variable on the type of mortgage)

Any moving fees, new furniture, white goods etc could be a few thousand.

This will give you a mortgage repayments of roughly ¬£820/month at current rates. If you double your deposit to 20%, so ¬£40,000, you qualify for better rates. Looking at what's currently available on the market you could have monthly repayments of around ¬£650.

Things to consider :

1. Rates are at historic lows, and will probably start going up in the next few years. Make sure you're not stretching yourself with monthly repayments, and build in a buffer for when rates go up.
2. You need to balance how much money you use a deposit with the need for a cash emergency fund if anything in your life goes wrong. Spending ¬£40,000 will still leave you a decent chunk (roughly six months wages)
3. If you rent your room out, and go over the allowances you'll be liable for tax. Make sure you have planned this beforehand.
4. Most standard mortgages allow you to make overpayments (usually upto a set amount per year, ie 10% of the remaining balance), which deduct straight from the principal. You could use this option if you find yourself with extra cash to reduce your monthly payments.

Maybe it's just my issues, but when I'm there now it feels like anything could happen at any moment.  Just before Kinkladze, unless Rosler had the ball you didn't expect much, and even then, Rosler could finish like a motherfucker but he was economical.  Lots of substance but only as much style as was necessary.

I was only in my early teens when Kinkladze signed, so even though I appreciated a player like Rosler who could get shit done, I was still at an age where I focused probably too much on *how* things were done and until that point David White was probably the flashiest player I'd seen in sky blue (still my favourite but admittedly it's mostly out of nostalgia).

Needless to say Kinkladze was on another level.  He had substance, and as long as he was on the pitch you felt like he could create something from nothing, but in all honesty at that age I loved him more for the style he brought to the team.  I just hadn't previously seen a City player that could 5 or 6 men for dead.  Passing options?  Who the fuck needs passing options?  It's only half the opposition team between Kinkladze and the goal.  No problem.

Unfortunately he was a luxury we probably couldn't afford (notice I said nothing about his defensive contribution, and at that time we were on defence much more than we were on attack), but if he was dropped into the team today I firmly believe he'd be as much of, if not more of a revelation than he was back in the day.

You can tell it was our first game and that BMG had played a couple already (so I believe). But we started to dominate more as the game went on, very optimistic start!
Grimes had a good game, lots of potential there. Emnes surprised me and did pretty well. Shelvey looks like he might cause a lot of problems to a lot of teams. 
Dyer didn't seem to gel, his final touch is lacking but I don't mind so much because he has done so much for the club. Ayew and Eder have a lot of potential... I think Ayew will perform as expected and Eder will outperform expectations. Routs looks dangerous with his runs...  as usual.

As the games keep coming, I think we will go from strength to strength. I'm positive of a top half finish and hopefully go a bit further than last season.

null,false,ZekkPacus,eng-essex,Essex,null,"I'll preface my thoughts by saying I am definitely on the left of what you might consider the Labour Party. I'm not a marxist nor a socialist (not quite anyway), but I'm definitely to the left of the three other candidates. 

I don't think that Corbyn as leader would be as damaging as everyone thinks and I maintain that the Labour Party lost the last election because they did not offer a vibrant enough alternative to the Conservative Party. Part of that is that although in the run up to the election they campaigned reasonably well, I remember countless occasions where the coalition did something I would class as anti-labour, and the Labour Party was nowhere to be seen contesting it. 

But if you look at the core of the election campaign, the message was 'fairness' against the Conservative's message of 'hard workers'. Both pretty nebulous and it's very hard to define fairness. The Labour Party would still have had austerity, would still have had a committment to deficit cut, and did not challenge the incumbent government on it's record with regards to disabled people or public services. They presented themselves, in everything, as a fairer Tory party. I don't know about you, but if I believed in the core message of the Tories, I'd vote Tory. Not Tory Lite. 

I think there's room for a centrist Labour (i'd prefer a less centrist party obviously but I'm realistic enough to understand that British politics won't currently encompass that) but it needs to be a centrist party with realistic differences from the Conservative Party. Real positions it can point to and say 'we would do this an entirely different way, and here's why'. 'We believe in cutting the deficit through the increase of money at the lowest end of society as we believe that increases money spent and therefore results in increased growth for small businesses'. That's just one way of being a centrist party whilst also being a labour party. 

Corbyn is the one of the leadership candidates who is currently standing up and saying, loud and clear, that he disagrees with the current government, and here's why. Cooper is too but I believe she's damaged by her association with Ed Balls - shame really. Andy Burnham's campaign seems to boil down to 'I am northern therefore I must be a friend of the working people, but I'd rather not talk about them' and Liz Kendall shouldn't be in the Labour Party - I'm sure she's a great politician but her message is anti-Labour.

I don't think Corbyn would want to be leader for the next 5 years - people keep bringing up his age and I'm sure he's aware of that. I think he wants to be leader to set the foundation for a Labour Party that's not just an opposition for the sake of being an opposition but really sits up and opposes and says why. Otherwise Labour as a party of government really is done - New Labour worked once but I just don't think you'll take the Tories' core vote from them again, which means you need to get voters back from the SNP, from the Greens, and from yes, UKIP.

EDIT: TL;DR there is room for a left-wing Labour Party if it articulates its message well.

That's the main thing though - we're doing a gentle rollout as and when trusts want it. Maybe we'll end up having the entire NHS in the future.

CPU is already attached to the motherboard but I can remove if requested and put it in its original box, new thermal paste will be required if you wish yo use the original cooler.

Motherboard comes with I/O plate, Sata cable and Installation disk. Due to me using water cooling on this motherboard I have lost the Screws that hold the back plate and CPU clamp to the motherboard, so if you wish to use the original AMD cooler those would be required.

Supposedly up for sale by Internazionale, he speaks the same language as Fonte off the field and the same language as the rest of the back-line when it comes to not conceding goals. 24 years old and would be the first Brazilian defender since the not-so-mighty sensation that was Pele. 

Supposedly on a contract of around 1.2m euros a year at Inter (around 25k a week) that lasts until 2018.

null,false,celestial1,null,null,null,"&gt;I have taken the liberty to compare Pedro with 2 of the players currently playing in the roles he would be expected to fill. I also omitted Hazard and Willian from this list as he will not likely be in direct competition with both players for game time.

He is a winger. Why is Author comparing him to Oscar? Also, he will be in direct competition with Willian, because he is a fucking winger!

&gt;It is clear that except for his return on goals and assists, which is not all that surprising considering the calibre of players he has around him and Barcelona‚Äôs style of play, Pedro is not quite as good as Salah and Oscar.

So he's not a good player because he can play well with other great players? So I guess Ronaldo better than Messi because he plays with a slightly worse team? Saying he's not as good as Salah or Oscar is laughable. And again, why is he comparing him with Oscar?

&gt;In fact, in Salah, Chelsea FC already possess a player with an almost similar skill set to Pedro. 

What? Salah is a one-footed pace merchant that flourishes in a counter attacking system against a high defensive line. Pedro is a two-footed players that can play on either wing and is a much more well rounded player that can play in either counterattacking or possession style systems. It's insulting to even think Salah is on the same level as Pedro after 1 good season.

&gt;Mourinho expects his midfielders to contribute in all phases  of play, as indicated by the number of tackles executed by Oscar. Pedro, on the other hand, rarely embraces the defensive side of the game,

Do you know that or are you just coughing up bile? And how does a 'business' differ from a business?



&gt;'Criticism[edit] Blair has been subject to criticism for potential conflicts of interest between his diplomatic role as a Middle East peace envoy, and his work with Tony Blair Associates,[7][8][9] and a number of prominent critics have even called for him to be sacked from his peace envoy role.[10]



What does that show? That he's got critics? I'm still none the wiser about what he's actually done wrong.



&gt;Blair has been subject to criticism after accusations of ""whitewashing"" the image and human rights record of the regime in Khazakstan.[5] In particular, opposition activists have published an open letter in a Kazak newspaper, Respublika, claiming Blair would have ""blood on his hands"" if did not stop assisting President Nursultan Nazarbayev.[citation needed] Blair has responded to such criticism by saying his choice to advise the country is an example of how he can ""nudge controversial figures on a progressive path of reform"", and has stated that he receives no personal profit from this advisory role.[11] The Kazakhstan foreign minister has said that the country was ""honoured and privileged"" to be receiving advice from Blair.[12][13]



So he works for the Kazakh Government. I'm really not sure what's so terrible about that - his areas of expertise (governance mainly) are exactly what Kazakhstan needs to progress.





&gt;Blair was reported to be have accepted a business advisory role with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, a situation deemed incompatible with his role as Middle East peace envoy;[14] Blair described the report as ""nonsense""'




So an unsubstantiated report, OK. Let's not let a complete lack of evidence get in the way of some good Blair hate though...


&gt;and here's a vid from Russell Brand which also explains why the man is a cunt : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFE1rAAG-Is



Russell Brand.



&gt;Anyway, Tony Blair is a bottom feeding war criminal cunt of a man who doesn't even deserve to be living in the bombed out remnants of a Helmand opium den.

Yeah it's that guy whose name came to you as soon as you saw the thread title. He may be in Leandro Damiao territory in terms of scout reporting but the Dutch Tarzan keeps coming up at head of the list for a reason. He' s 24, he plays for Celtic, what other reasons do you need? He adds to the Dutch contingency and is getting more in-demand with every Champions League appearance. 

He was part of the defence with Forster that went 1,215 minutes without conceding a goal and won the Celtic player of the year as well that year.

I've done 90 hour weeks for MONTHS on end yet these people don't want to put the work in to increase their pay to the minimum amount. What does this say about these people?

Ah, so we've gone from people with no jobs to people not working hard enough. I honestly don't give a fuck how hard you work, also we aren't talking about how much you work FOR MONTHS!!!!1!!!! it's how much you earn at all times.

&gt;So you have people who can't raise even a trivial amount of money wanting to support another person? Where are they going to get the extra money? They fully expect the STATE i.e. OTHER people to pay for them when they don't have enough money to live on.

We have different views on trivial, it also assumes that the other person will not work and that two cannot actually live on anything less than that amount of money, which is not true.

&gt;And what is wrong with keeping money I earn. Go on call me greedy, you want more money which you do not earn yet I'm the one considered to be greedy? This law clearly stops people coming in unable to support themselves.

I had no intention of calling you greedy, though that does seem to be how you see yourself.  In my view, if you pay for everything personally and never use any public services you should be entitled to keep all your money, the moment you rely on a public service of any kind that goes out the window.

I also think Raheem wants to be the star in a side and get lots of attention. Here he wasn't going to get that as much, as we have an excellent English core, and he will never be the focus here, in my opinion. At City, he is there English savior, and will get all the buzz.

It's a matter of semantics.

If we look at roughly the way a sample secure messaging system works, it's quite easy:

 - Every user downloads the application. As part of its operation, the application generates a public/private key pair.
 - The public key is submitted to a central server and stored under the name of the user.
 - Many public keys can be stored against one user, allowing for many devices all with separate key pairs.
 - When you want to send a message to bob@example.com, your application encrypts the message it's going to send with a symmetric key. One copy of this symmetric key is made for every one of Bob's public keys, each is encrypted with a public key and the encrypted copies - along with the encrypted message - are sent to the central server.
 - Next time one of Bob's devices checks into the central server, it picks up the encrypted message and the encrypted key. It uses its private key to decrypt the encrypted key, and the now-decrypted key to decrypt the message.
 - If one of Bob's devices is lost or stolen, he can have the appropriate public key removed from the central server, ensuring that the device can no longer decrypt messages meant for him.

So how do we update this system to decrypt everything going through for the government's benefit? Simple. We update the central database so one of the public keys registered against bob@example.com doesn't correspond to one of his devices at all; it instead corresponds to a private key held by the government. We store every message that comes through the system and we also store the corresponding decryption keys - naturally, encrypted with the government's public key. We also update the system so when it lists the devices bob can delete the keys for, it doesn't list the government's ""device"" (really a whacking great computer somewhere in Cheltenham that goes through ten million messages per day and finds terrorists with only a 1% false positive rate. Which in plain English means GCHQ now have to investigate 100,000 messages per day, most of which are completely innocuous).

In this way:

 - Messages are still encrypted. (Heaven help us if the government's system is compromised, however!)
 - The organisation running the system still can't see the messages. So they can honestly say they respect your privacy while obeying the law.
 - Cameron gets to keep the spies happy without banning encryption altogether.",null,0,null,1436987150,null,0,false,0,ct4gpt4,null,t3_3ddwj4,null,t1_ct4gpt4,null,t1_ct4ddgc,null,null,null,1437878060,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

5 years ago, around this time, Armagh **destroyed** Donegal in the qualifiers in Crossmaglen. I was there. It was embarrassing to watch by the last 15 minutes. Look how far they've come now. They have dominated football ever since Jim McGuinness took over and have produced some of best football I've ever seen (you can clearly tell I'm not Joe Brolly or Pat Spillane.) All it took was one revolutionary mind to change how they play and they went from one of the whipping boys of Ulster football to titans of the sport. 

I like McGeeney and what he's trying to do with Armagh, but they're a team in transition and have been for some time. One of our boys plays county for them, and even his progress is staggering; from his strength to ability on and off the ball. He can literally turn on a dime now if he needed to, and if it hadn't been for injury, he would've played more games in the National League this spring. 

As for the likes of Dublin and Kerry, has there ever been a time where they haven't been heralded as favourites before the ball was thrown in for the first round of the Championship?

I've been playing senior/intermediate football for four years now and have seen my team relegated twice (one time we were ""saved"" thanks to a restructuring of the divisions from four to three) and I've thought of quitting about a dozen times now either from lack of game time, taking a year out for my studies (graduated last summer), or just how the team was doing was really depressing. And yet I've kept at it; I'm fitter (somewhat) and definitely stronger because of it. That shit's like crack sometimes. 

TL;DR: keep at it. You'll regret it if you don't and it's something to be part of. As for county level; well, fuck the Dubs and Kerry :P

Again, because it appears that you might suffer from being a bit of a moron, the thread is for Liverpool fans to discuss which players from rival teams might be over rated, by fans, the media, etc. Not that they're not good players, but that they're not quite as good as everyone seems to say they are.

I disagree with a lot of the posters here. My thoughts on Arsenal are pretty simple. I think Sanchez might be the best player in the league behind Hazard. I think that Cazorla is actually underrated, and doesn't get as much credit as he probably deserves. Obviously Ozil is world class, but he's drawn a lot of criticism for his form at times. I don't think that's enough to call him overrated, however. I think Ospina is another player who hasn't gotten enough credit, and Giroud doesn't deserve a majority of the criticism he has received. Koscielny is class as well.

You could say some of the younger players are a bit overrated, but you could say the same about any team's young players. Until they have proven their quality, they are just potential and hype. 

I think to prefer Wilshire over Hendo at this point is a bit silly; Hendo has improved and performed at a really good level, whereas Wilshire has been constantly hampered by injuries and at this point, largely remains potential. Obviously he has had great moments, and I do believe he'll be a quality player, but overall, including durability (which is very important), I'd take Hendo.

Obviously as Liverpool fans, we want to believe in our players and have a natural tendency to prefer them, perhaps even overrate them. Just as you would do with Arsenal players, and any other fan would do with their club's players. The point of this thread is to discuss that phenomenon, which I think has gotten a bit lost. 

Of course there are also players on Liverpool who opposing fans probably feel are overrated, but that's not what this thread is for.  You're more than welcome to join the discussion and disagree, but it's not a good look for Arsenal fans on the whole for you to come in trolling and being and outright cunt. I respect your opinion and on the whole I agree, there are a number of silly posts in here ""trashing"" players on teams that performed much better than we were able to last season. But at the end of the day everyone has a right to their opinions. I'd just ask that if you do decide to venture into our sub, act like you're more mature than a 10 year old, even if you're not.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Charging to visit the NHS has been necessary for years now. The NHS was founded in a completely different era to the one we currently live in and no where else in the world do you not pay to visit a doctor.

Paying to see a doctor (a token amount say ¬£10) would drastically cut waiting times and ensure that huge sums of money could be raised for the NHS. This would lead to being able to pay staff properly and have far better facilities.

The UK's health service is poor relative to the rest of the world as shown here.

28/30 in the OECD http://www.eiumedia.com/index.php/component/k2/item/1805-the-uk-is-placed-just-28th-out-of-30-oecd-countries-for-healthcare-resourcing-according-to-latest-eiu-research

And

According to the European health commission the worst of the 'rich' European countries http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2014/EHCI_2014_report.pdf

Those are two unbiased sources. There is one source suggesting the NHS is world class and it is from a heavily biased source that bases much of it's methodology on cost. I would rather more expensive and effective health service than one that provides cheap but terrible quality of care.

As usual I fully expect to be down voted for expressing this opinion on this sub. However I will tell you that anecdotally as a foreigner and dating a Frog and having a very international group of friends (I've lived in 4 countries) everyone hates your health service. And I mean literally every single person I know who's not English.

It's completely black and white, there is no grey.

This way we can see if the member's choice is strongly for a strike, or strongly for actions like refusing overtime, working to rule, etc.

My Blair doesn't appear on their [list of staff](http://www.africagovernance.org/africa/pages/our-people), although interestingly he does appear in a Telegraph article about [AGI and their operations](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/11262947/Questions-over-Tony-Blairs-opaque-deals-in-Africa.html):

&gt;The emails sent between one of Mr Blair‚Äôs charities ‚Äì the Africa Governance Initiative (AGI) ‚Äì and the US government suggest the former prime minister was eager to use his connections with sovereign wealth funds to secure deals in South Sudan, an impoverished African state with untapped oil reserves.
&gt;
&gt;The latest disclosure threatens to embroil Mr Blair in fresh criticism over his charitable activities. One Conservative MP said it was time for Mr Blair to make a ‚Äúfull disclosure‚Äù of his various business dealings to ensure there was no conflict of interest between his philanthropic and moneymaking activities, while a leading human rights charity criticised Mr Blair for being ‚Äúopaque‚Äù.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt;Human rights campaigners criticised Mr Blair for taking a role with Ethiopia. Leslie Lefkow, of Human Rights Watch, said: ‚ÄúBlair and AGI‚Äôs activities in Ethiopia are opaque. How is he supporting governance in an authoritarian state that suppresses all independent criticism, where the police and security forces enjoy total impunity, and the ruling party won 99.6 per cent of the seats in the last election?‚Äù

Strap yourself in, it's gurning time. Think about if Man U do sign Otamendi or someone akin to that class; then Jones is going to have to decide if he is happy being behind Rojo, Smalling and the new guy. Whether it's loan, buy, buy-back, sell-on clause, blood-pact or virgin ritual there are a few different ways in which the transfer could work out for all parties and when he's not staring at the headlights he's adding to his 17 England caps.

If you wanted it that much you would do the 60 hours a week permanently. My father did 80 hours a week for 25 years. Oh but I want somebody else to pay for it.

&gt; We have different views on trivial, it also assumes that the other person will not work and that two cannot actually live on anything less than that amount of money, which is not true.

So why do we give tax credits then? Because the government assumes you can't live on below X amount of money.

&gt; I had no intention of calling you greedy, though that does seem to be how you see yourself. In my view, if you pay for everything personally and never use any public services you should be entitled to keep all your money, the moment you rely on a public service of any kind that goes out the window.

Like what? 

I pay for health insurance, I also keep healthy and watch what I eat. It's called responsibility. Much like the ¬£18600 rule. They ensure that individuals take responsibility rather than getting others to pay.

Secondly the moment I rely on public service?

Involved in a car crash? What makes you think the police will come and help me? You also realise that there was a change about a decade ago whereby if you are involved in a serious crash the state tends to ask your insurance to cover a fat chunk of the cost

Agreed. Lallana is way too talented and has fantastic vision, touch and skill on the ball, he's simply way too good to be a supersub. And you're right, a good winger isn't just about being quick.

We lived together in my home city of Norwich for just under two years, the latter eight months she spent applying for every job she could which satisfied the Tier 2 income threshold of ¬£21k before her visa expired and she had to leave the country January last year. 

With the UK employment laws being extremely stacked against non-EU nationals (can only apply to employers with a license to hire foreigners, are willing to pay a ¬£1,000 sponsorship fee to employ you, and can prove that there isn't a single UK or EU person who is at least competent enough to fufil the basic needs of the role), the only other option we had was this spousal visa.

This minimum income of ¬£18,600 might seem okay for London, but in the east that would be considered pretty decent, but not easily attainable to half the population (as is the case nationally, 47% being below it), despite the fact I was able to support both of us (combined rent, utilities, run a car etc) on ¬£14k, this isn't enough, as she might dare to ""rely on the state"", despite literally one of the conditions of the spousal visa being ""not able to recourse public funds"" anyway. If she was just allowed to use her Masters to get a job on a level playing field, we could both be a happy tax-paying couple like everyone else.

I get so angry about this, it has been one and a half years since we lived together, I am being told by my country that I'm not worthy of having a life with my fianc√© and that I should ""move to Singapore instead"", being cast off as some dead weight to the society I've lived in for the last 28 years because I want to live with someone born on a different continent.

**Just let me life a life with her**, let me save up for a house, get a dog, cook her dinner, spend Christmas with my parents, why am I not worthy of that?

null,false,NickTM,1,Speroni,null,"Palace came into my life relatively late. Nobody in my family (other than my brother) took much of an interest in sport, especially not my dad, so I took my brother's leads in sports I was interested in. As such, I followed cycling, rugby, cricket and so on and so forth. It was only by the time I was about 14 or 15 that I actually began to really care about football.

I supported Palace, since they were my local team, but I took Aston Villa as a second team because of a relative supporting them, and because when you're in secondary school, nobody wants to talk about the Championship. It was only a couple of years later that I had the money and inclination to go to Palace games. The club had always been a presence in my life, but it was around the age of 16 that I finally felt like I belonged in my supportership of Palace.

I suppose the club represents a very specific part of me, in a way. I grew up on the border of Bromley and Lewisham, a reasonably affluent area, to a firmly middle-class family. I was slightly out of place with the rest of them, having gone to a South-East London comprehensive school in a rather poor area of Lewisham, as opposed to the private and grammar schools my sister and brother went to. I think Palace is much the same way. It feels slightly out of place amongst all the other big London clubs, all the money of Chelsea, the history of Arsenal and West Ham, and the constant failures of Spurs. There's few clubs more grounded and unassuming than Palace, even when we're up here in the Prem surrounded by glamour.

It's a strange, strange situation we find ourselves in now. When I was growing up, all the talk was about Arsenal and Manchester United, and then later Chelsea and so on. Palace was always a small club in South London, quietly chugging away and doing nothing interesting. Now, we're signing the likes of Yohan Cabaye, and my brain still hasn't quite flipped over into that way of thinking. I'm still assuming we're a minnow surrounded by giants, when in fact the club is growing before our eyes, and at a faster rate than ever before. It'll all come crashing down eventually - it always does with us - but until then I'll enjoy the ride.",null,0,null,1436989304,null,0,false,0,ct4i62c,null,t3_3deijf,null,t1_ct4i62c,null,t3_3deijf,null,null,null,1437878974,null,2,false,crystalpalace,t5_2tqdj,2,null

They do this not because they are ghouls but to remind themselves of their own mortality. The phrase momento mori describes this. It is far too easy to fall into an easy waste of life and time and to waste your time and life. 

This is why in my mid 30s I have done most of the things people merely dream about. I just get up and go and do things people are afraid of doing. I mention it now and again about over landing to Vladivostok. Travelling round the world on a motorbike. Jumping out of air planes all sorts of things. I'm on my 4th 100 things to do before I die list already. How big a dent have you made in yours? 

Death and witnessing of it reminds me that time is VERY short and therefore reminds me to keep my attitude of do more shit in life. Those who insulate themselves from such a reality tend to waste their lives and the greatest fear of mine? On their death bed wishing they'd done this and that... but by that time it is too late.

This is reflected in my clan and ancestry. Our dead are not buried forever they are buried for 7 years. After 7 years the oldest son (that's me) are to exhume the corpses. We clean the bones of any remaining flesh and place the bones into large jars. The jars are then placed in the ghost houses. As the eldest son I partaken in a number of exhumations. This is our tradition this is our heritage this is why we constantly get a kick in the pants to go do something amazing now and again.

Ready for the least Polish name since Phil Jones? Well here is Kamil Glik. 27 years old and he has 31 international appearances along with the size and aggression to make David Haye shit himself all over again. 

Older and certainly wiser than other candidates, but it would be hard to convince his club to let him go as he has been captain of Torino for a while now and they seem to be a team on the incline. He is contracted until 2017 (and apparently has the same agent as Bartosz Biakowski).

Remember I said that there was a 1% false positive rate? Well, let's imagine there's a 99% detection rate - ie. we detect 99% of terrorists by examining their messages. 

We'll assume there are 10 million users of a popular messaging app, and that 5% of terrorists are stupid enough to use it despite Cameron's very public demands that such apps encryption be open to the government. (It makes the numbers easy).

But 5% of what? How many terrorists are there? 100? 1,000? 10,000?

In 2013, [289 people](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/operation-of-police-powers-under-the-terrorism-act-2000-quarterly-update-to-december-2014-data-tables) were arrested for terrorism-related offences.

We can probably assume that there aren't vast numbers of terrorists under the radar. If there were, we'd have seen a lot more activity since 7/7. But we haven't.  So I think it's safe to assume that those 289 people represent the majority of terrorists who posed any sort of real threat throughout the year. We'll call it 300.

So, over the course of a year - assuming 5% of those 300 are using our instant messaging application, there are 15 terrorists actively using it. We can detect 99% of these, so that's between 14-15 terrorists our automated system will find.

Great. But what about that false-positive rate? That's ""people who are flagged up as being worth further investigation, but turn out to be totally innocent"". Well, with a 1% false-positive rate, that means we need to investigate 99,998 people in addition to our 15 terrorists.

It's a job creation programme, not a terrorist finding programme, and it's absurd to claim otherwise.

So they've maintained the 45p rate of tax, with the same threshold as when it was first introduced [despite significant inflation](http://www.rateinflation.com/inflation-rate/uk-historical-inflation-rate?start-year=2010&amp;end-year=2015).

So authoritarian is their outlook, they have floated ideas which would destroy large sections of the British economy if carried out, nevermind the corrosion of the right's of ordinary citizens which would also occur.

Thanks for the link. Interesting reading. I'll probably need to read it a couple of times through I think. The interesting part to me is where it talks about Thatcher and Blair. I've read in another thread that some Labour supporters see Blair as a bit of a Tory. IF that is true then does that mean that effectively we haven't had traditional Labour since pre Thatcher? (despite three terms in power).

&gt;Jeremy Corbyn was one of 206 MPs to sign the March 2007 Early Day Motion 1240 calling for the positive recognition of NHS homeopathic hospitals[1].

&gt;Following the publication of the House of Commons' Science and Technology Committee's report ""Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy"" in February 2010, Corbyn signed Early Day Motion 908: Science and Technology Committee Report on Homeopathy, which was critical of the report[2].

&gt;He was asked on Twitter why he had signed EDM 908[3]. He replied:

&gt;jeremycorbyn @leftoutside I believe that homeo-meds works for some ppl and that it compliments 'convential' meds. they both come from organic matter... (7:33 PM Mar 5th)[4]

&gt;In May 2011, Jeremy Corbyn signed Early Day Motion 1820 which welcomed a campaign to ""place homeopathy research on the national agenda as a credible scientific field of inquiry"" and called for the Government to facilitate research into homeopathy[5].

  .

&gt; Do you believe this adds anything of merit to debate about the future of the party?

Of course it does. Corbyn believes in giving people stuff that has no more than a placebo effect. 

Now we keep getting told Corbyn's ideas are just as valid as anyone else's. Se lets debate this. The NHS spends billions on drugs.

And of course this was all on top of a huge number of traditional Labour voters going over to UKIP. A number of those voters only went over to UKIP because they no longer thought that Labour represented them as working class people.

Oh and don't forget Labour's (leftist) policies were consistently well thought of and polled the best in studies.

The Conservatives (the party, definitely not all its members/associates) are fairly liberal socially in the scheme of things, and are far more polished as a party, I can't fault them there.

People's limited understanding and narrow perspectives always make me think of this quote by George Friedman

&gt;I am not arguing that political leaders are geniuses, scholars, or even gentlemen and ladies. Simply, political leaders know how to be leaders or they wouldn't have emerged as such. It is the delight of all societies to belittle their political leaders, and leaders surely do make mistakes. But the mistakes they make, when carefully examined, are rarely stupid. More likely, mistakes are forced on them by circumstance.

1. Guilt is a better driver of patient compliance than Cash. Cash means you think you are paying for something, so you don't care paying the fine. It's your problem solved. A simple sign logging in missed appointments in a doctor's office does more to improve compliance

2. The problem is patient choice. We want Rolls Royces but don't want to pay for it. What we want is plenty of hospitals sitting around until we need them which is nonsensical. We don't want waiting times and we bring up places like America. Never mind the fact we don't want to pay doctors like they do in America, nor do we get that in the USA the waiting times for essential services are often longer and that anything with a wait time in the UK is generally not as vital as people think. We want Hip Replacements today but we don't want to pay for the infrastructure and training to have the doctors to do this.

3. Pay systems generally hurt the poorest. Because they generally don't save up for a rainy day. The system is cheap cause it treats everyone. Increasing debts among the poorest hurts them and the biggest cause of bankruptcy in the USA was healthcare. Moving to the same trap that they created is silly. 

4. We refuse to pay junior doctors well and we keep increasing work loads on staff with no comparable increase  to pay. At the moment a London Tube Driver earns nearly double a Junior Doctor and the Junior Doctor has 80,000 quid's worth of debt. A steep mountain for anyone to pay. Comparable fields have much less debt. In addition we have similar problems with nursing. And we stopped recruitment of foreign doctors creating a stranglehold by agencies offering Locums as we cannot fill up our own posts. 

5 All during this we seem to care more about what patients like rather than what's good for them. We aren't standing up and making a drive for better health and fighting smoking and drinking. Instead we are talking about how patients should be rating doctors or how doctor's salaries should be performance related or how patients should be able to pick which hospital they go to rather than make it streamlined.

It's absolutely not bullshit. Whatever your opinions are of Clarkson, charitable or not, quite frankly nobody gives a shit.  The BBC put themselves into a situation where they let a man get so powerful and so influential that he became bigger than the show he worked on. Like it or not, that's what happened. To the extent that people are almost tribal about something as insignificant as a TV presenter. 

And that's all fine, either you like him or you don't. But top gear was one of the most watched shows in the world and that was because of the dynamic of those three. It was sold across the world and was worth hundreds of millions of pounds. They will lose all those global viewers now, nobody outside of the UK even knows who Chris Evans is. 

And when they need to make up all that money, who will they blame when they need to make cuts? Probably the government because they're in charge of their funding. Because it sure as shit isn't going to be themselves.

So yeah, I wonder which iconic Brit theyle roll out to preach about how great the BBC is then, when all they really need to do is admit they've fucked up on Clarkson, not even for firing him, but how they managed to whole situation.

I was charging ¬£48 an hour for PC repairs, so how many hours are you going to spend putting together components? 

This becomes a nightmare when you get some duff component, which causes intermittent problems - do you have enough matching components at home to swap out the parts and identify which one it is?

What when you sell a PC which is flakey, and you can't work out why, and the customer is looking at you to sort it?

Hardware is a mug's game, IMO, and I only took it because it's part of the job. To me the satisfaction of the job was solving obscure software bugs.

Far better to tell your customers ""here, this Dell is a bargain at ¬£400"" and then have them pay you do set it up for them, remove the bloatware, get it on their network and working the way they expect.

I have been paid ¬£40 or ¬£50 per hour literally to take the computer out the box for my customers, plug the keyboard and monitor in, install software and so on all the way until I'm happy with it - I had very rewarding relationships with my customers because they knew that I wasn't trying to rip them off.

The only time I did a build was when someone wanted a ""gaming PC"" because I thought the prices of prebuilt ones was shocking. But just as your grannies are happy with ¬£400 Dells with onboard graphics, when a customer is asking you to do this their teenagers are happy with a ¬£50 graphics card - that's enough to make an amazing improvement of WoW's graphics for them. 

You don't need to get everything in your marketing bullet points - what's important is to tell them ""I'm your PC guy"" and to be memorable and distinctive. Once people know you as this reliable, capable PC guy, they'll be coming to you for whatever they need - they'll call you up and say ""do you do this?""",null,0,null,1436993225,null,0,false,0,ct4kusj,null,t3_3de42u,null,t1_ct4kusj,null,t1_ct4jwgn,null,null,null,1437880897,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

Seriously? Let's take an analogy. 

There are two kinds of CPR providers. The ""Basic"" and ""Advanced"". The basic CPR guys are those who are simply around the person. The advanced guys are people like doctors. 

Apparently if you have an AED, a basic provider of CPR will have a 90% effective rating. The remaining 10% is simply due to the training of the Advanced guy. 

Now the problem is we lack on the 90% but we want to spend money on the 10%. The biggest problem the NHS has is a lack of staff. We made it harder for foreign doctors to come and work fro us. We also are set to kick out any doctor or nurse not earning 35,000 quid. 

But we are desperate for staff. We are short on A&amp;E, Geriatrics, Paeds, Psychiatry and GP staff and we are not going to fill those up by increasing job losses as we send out what few remaining foreign doctors we do have and create a stagnant job where pay does not rise.

C).  Mitrovic is a similar sort of player but much younger (albeit not quite as good yet) and looks set for Newcastle for around half of Benteke's fee.

Are you kidding? Clarkson is popular cos he's damn good at his job, just because you're up on your high horse it doesn't mean you get to dictate what television people enjoy. The BBC fucked up by letting him get away with stuff right from the get go, if they had then there's a very good chance this would never happen. But the BBC loved the money he brought him so let him do as he pleased. 

I don't blame Clarkson at all for costing the BBC money, he was just good at presenting TV programmes. It's entirely the BBCs fault they let such a huge chunk of income come exclusively from top gear. Jesus christ your logic is absolutely nonsensical. 

The BBC had a choice to make, keep acting like cowards and never stand up to him and just bank the money he brought in, or sack him and take the financial hit. 

The took the second option, and the loss of money isn't Clarksons fault. They should have planned for it, at least planned past bitching at the government. 

&gt;the government who is making cuts to them with a clear agenda (correct) 

Any evidence for that? A clear a agenda? (correct). What a load of fucking bullshit. Every public sector organisation is taking cuts, as is most of the country. Why would the BBC be immune?

&gt; Why would the BBC be immune?

&gt; Any evidence for that? A clear a agenda?

the tories have always been openly about privatisation, they never liked the BBC and have had secret meetings with Rupert mudoch on more than 1 ocassion (a man who has a reputation for buying the majority of media in a country to spread propaganda) like he did in Australia and the U.S. they're also planning channel 4 privatisation.

He has quite a long history of campaigning for it. In 2007 he backed Early Day Motion 1240 which reads:

&gt;That this House welcomes the positive contribution made to the health of the nation by the NHS homeopathic hospitals; notes that some six million people use complementary treatments each year; believes that complementary medicine has the potential to offer clinically-effective and cost-effective solutions to common health problems faced by NHS patients, including chronic difficult to treat conditions such as musculoskeletal and other chronic pain, eczema, depression, anxiety and insomnia, allergy, chronic fatigue and irritable bowel syndrome; expresses concern that NHS cuts are threatening the future of these hospitals; and calls on the Government actively to support these valuable national assets.

And in 2011 backed Early Day Motion 1820:

&gt;That this House welcomes the campaign by the Homeopathy Research Institute (HRI) to place homeopathy research on the national agenda as a credible scientific field of inquiry; notes that the HRI is an innovative charity that does not promote the practice of homeopathy itself, but rather promotes and facilitates scientific research into homeopathy,of which the most controversial aspect is the use ofhighly diluted medicines; acknowledges that, in the UK, the practice of homeopathy has been part of the National Health Service (NHS) since its inception, and since thattime homeopathic medicines have been prescribable to patients; observes that the Faculty of Homeopathy Act 1950 states that the public has access to homeopathy under the NHS so long as patients demand it and doctors are trained to provide it; and calls on the Government to facilitate research into this important area to ascertain the effectiveness of homeopathy.

So he believes it should prescribed to people with conditions as broad and serious as musculoskeletal conditions to allergies and IBS, and wants to see the government fund *yet more* research into the dead horse of a subject.

He's also a staunch backer of herbal remedies, which is slightly less controversial, but does provide context for his interest in ""alternative"" medicines.",null,0,null,1436995567,null,0,false,0,ct4meew,null,t3_3devzl,null,t1_ct4meew,null,t1_ct4i226,null,null,null,1437882057,null,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

Oh don't fucking misrepresent my comment so blatantly that's pathetic. The BBC is responsible for the money it will lose from Clarksons dismissal, because it's a situation they created for themselves. That was perfectly clear from the context of this entire conversation you cynical arse. 

And re Murdoch, business leaders meet with country leaders all the time. It's part of politicians day to day work. Maybe he was negotiating on licencing for a new merger for sky? Or maybe for one of his newspapers? Both of which require government permission. 

But no no,  the most logical and sensible explanation is a conspiracy to scrap the BBC right? Or is that just what you desperately want it to be?

The only time they claim a policy directly benefits this underclass, it turns out to be a long-game play to further their extinction by transforming a handful.  E.g. right-to-buy, turns a number of social-housing tenants into home owners, but of course it means the next generation of people aren't social housing tenants, they're now in the clutches of some Tory-voting slumlord.

The Tories know who are their supporters and who aren't, and those that aren't (see recent events concerning: Scotland, Labour Party funding, and laws around strikes) are punished and further marginalised resulting in a stronger position for themselves.  The Labour Party will probably elect ""more-left-wing that Michael Foot"" Jeremy Corbyn as leader as a direct reaction to this, and that will lead to Labour in the wilderness for the next fifteen years.

I know I'd be clean fecked after working 9-5 then rushing home from Belfast for football at 7 or so with nothing in my stomach and essentially running on fumes.

It's at a tipping point where, in my opinion, the GPA will put their foot down and say either pay us for putting in so much time and effort and receiving so little from it, or lower your demands for the squads. 

Even at club level, you barely have time off. If you're not officially training with whatever squad/team you play with, you're given a programme of some sort so that you're ready for pre-season. In a nutshell, it's pre-pre-season.

null,false,dontsteponthecrack,pardew,Pardew,null,"I travel quite a bit for work, so I found some time on a flight to answer your question ‚Äì sorry it‚Äôs so long. And yes, it is painfully middle class from the leafy bits of South Croydon / Surrey borders.

I've been heading to Palace for over 25 years, and it‚Äôs been a challenging relationship. My Dad having introduced me at a young age to Selhurst, this was during Liverpool's dominance of the 80s and as a young lad swept up in LFC mania, I sat in the Main Stand for my first game and watched Liverpool beat Palace 0-2. I left that game a Palace fan and my Dad, who had been an Evertonian before moving to Croydon was becoming a Palace fan too, on the back of a handful of games over the previous few seasons.

This was around the time of the Hillsborough disaster, so we used to get to games early and would stand near the emergency exit with me on a stool my Dad 'borrowed' from school so we could leap over the fence should there be a problem. 
I was lucky to fondly remember the 1990 season and see the Wright / Bright / Thomas / Salako / Coppell years.

We bought season tickets, sitting first in the Arthur Wait, then in the family enclosure in the Main Stand and then when the Holmesdale was rebuilt we moved to Block E about half way up. I remember my Dad coming home telling me he'd been to Selhurst and sat in around 100 seats until he found the ones he wanted.

I can't say I've always enjoyed being a Palace fan, many times it has been fucking awful. On reflection i think it was extra bad because Palace were at their self-imploding worse during my formative years. For example, I remember Palace getting promoted and being excited all summer -  i could finally talk to my cunty playground mates at the same level as their cunty glory hunter teams.....and then we got destroyed by liverpool 6-1. Even 20-25 years ago, when the MUFC/LFC money was starting to be spent - post the introduction of the EPL - every little twat seemed to support a top 6 team, with a small smattering of WHUFC and CFC, who were still a shit but gobby team then.

It wasn't immediate, but over the next few seasons, going week in week out to Selhurst, giving up the opportunity to hang out with mates etc to watch over paid prima donnas not try very hard - and i think the season that really hit home was the season where we didn't win at home until the last game and Clinton scored on his full debut against Sheffield Wednesday.

I think that was really my underlying feeling from that period ‚Äì Palace had moved away from the players who gave a fuck to the players who clearly didn‚Äôt and also for the most part were not good enough. Palace had always pushed a lot of youth through the ranks and this didn‚Äôt really happen with any success during this period, instead a load of very average crap were earning big and offering very little effort to play for the red and blue shirt.

My life was fully intertwined with Palace when i started working there at 16 with some mates, as part of the matchday staff. 
I started to realise how small Palace really were at this point, it was essentially a skeleton team, decimated by lack of investment by Noades, then the failure of Goldberg and his mindless, reckless Venables investment and over spending. I was working games for Wimbledon too and i realised i enjoyed watching their games more and around this time, my Dad and I were falling out because we were both not enjoying Palace, but me much more vociferously than him, so i gave up my season ticket to my sister after 10 years, shortly after that i gave up working at Palace and became gainfully employed away from Selhurst.

I maybe attended five palace games over the next ten years, i kept an eye on results, but didn't follow the progress closely - Dad nagged me to go to the Millenium Stadium, but i was fucked if i was going to those games, so i didn't. I didn't keep in touch with my Palace mates and after a little while, i was an armchair Palace fan only.

I slowly found my way back to Palace a couple of times only to watch a match and realise i didn't feel anything ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt have given a shit.

In 2009 i moved back to Croydon having moved 30 miles away and I started getting more interested again, but I didn't enjoy going, so after a couple of failed attempts i gave up trying again.
In my line of work i get a fair bit of hospitality for stuff, i far more enjoyed going to the Emirates or the Bridge with hospitality than going to Selhurst. I feel no affinity for the Palace Ultras, but i'm glad we have them, because the atmosphere at the big grounds is awful - the worse i can recall is the Nou Camp, yes it is amazing for FCB v RM but against anyone else it is worse than the Emirates.

Being a Palace fan is tough, I support because they are my local team, it wouldn't matter if they were a conference team, my Dad made it very clear to me that if i didn't support my local team then they would go out of existence and i feel that as though that fact has become more important over the years. Every cunt now supports AFC, LFC, CFC, MUFC for no good reason and they do not understand how detrimental that is to the national game and grass roots football as a whole. There are over 100 professional teams in this country, people need to do their bit and support their local team, not just pick their favourite from the top 6.

Over the last few years, as my son has got a bit older, i've introduced him to Palace ‚Äì he didn‚Äôt have any choice, see the local team comment above. We've been to a few games over the last few seasons and our most recent was the Speroni testimonial. On the back of which I‚Äôve been to Speroni‚Äôs restaurant a few times and honestly, it‚Äôs really good! I got to Wembley for the play-off game and I loved it, in fact I'm much more enjoying Palace since CPFC2010 took over and I'm much more enjoying taking my son and answering his million questions than actually trying to enjoy the football, he is the next generation of Palace fans and I hope for his sake he doesn‚Äôt have half the shitty Palace heartache I‚Äôve had.
Palace are my local team and I will forever be a Palace fan. I doubt I will ever have a season ticket again, I may get one and then use it occasionally when my son and I want to use it, but every home game will just be too much for me.

For those who have read my other comments, Palace are a family club who offer something different to other London clubs, it may not be totally unique, but it is worth savouring.

For example, I would have smashed the cunt in the face the other day who said Selhurst was a difficult to get, shithole, eye sore. It‚Äôs an old ground in the middle of South London, I get really tired of people who think that the Emirates or Wembley is somehow the minimum standard for a football stadium ‚Äì go and see Crawley Town you prick and then realise that 80 out of the 100 stadiums in the country are like this! And globally it‚Äôs even worse! But because of big tv money everyone seems to think teams are shit if they don‚Äôt have a blingy stadium and 10000 parking spaces. ITS FUCKING SOUTH LONDON, THE CAPITAL CITY OF THIS COUNTRY YOU IGNORANT CUNTS. WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS COUNTRY‚ÄôS GDP IS GENERATED, WHICH IS HOW WE SUBSIDISE YOU FUCKING CAVE DWELLERS. Obviously this has become a rant, but please understand this is how I feel about Palace and their league position. Without teams like Palace, with their sustainable model, including aesthetically challenging stadium, the EPL wouldn‚Äôt exist.

I get nervous about Palace spending big on Cabaye and on Dann‚Äôs (and others) wages, but now we have, I feel we ought to continue spending on QUALITY players, to protect the investment we have made in the squad already. We seem to have found a way to deliver a position between 8th and 14th, which is fine for me, so we ought to cement that if at all possible, without risking everything.

I don‚Äôt see Pardew being the answer to all our problems and I don‚Äôt think he will be here in a couple of seasons, but he is perfect for now and I hope he can kick on and get Wilf back in the England team alongside Dann and Austin (lets hope).

It pleases me that Parish and Co seem to have sensible values, similar to mine, because although Palace need much 
modernisation they also need to avoid the calamity on offer from the Jordan / Goldberg types trying to turn us into PSG and MCFC. We are not them and I truly doubt we will ever be them, we ought to be the best we can be without selling our souls to the devil and maintaining a sustainable model ‚Äì to me that is Palace being true to themselves.

The fact that De Bruyne is listed twice, once as a rotation and once as a first team opens up more space in the CM for Yaya to be used more. I put him one the bench just cos it was easier to write out, but in reality, dinho or nando would always have to play as CDM to sure up defence, but dinho could also push further forward. That way we can literally tailor our midfield 3 so to the opposition were facing. Super strong opposition, we'd go nando, pogba and dinho or yaya for example, or a weaker opposition put silva or nasri or de bruyne in the midfield to give a bigger atacking threat in sacrifice of tracking back.",null,0,null,1436996449,null,0,false,0,ct4myw8,null,t3_3df2mz,null,t1_ct4myw8,null,t3_3df2mz,null,null,null,1437882538,null,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1,null

New labour was shit too, don't get me wrong.  I personally despise the conservative ideology wholeheartedly, but I don't necessarily hate tory supporters themselves.

Main thing that pisses me off about the tory party (and new labour, to a varying extent) is... well, everything they are, everything they do and everything they represent.  They bang on about ""supporting working families"" and making Britain a better place for those who want to ""work hard and get on"", while doing everything in their power to make it harder to do so.  They scapegoat the unemployed, immigrants and people on benefits.  They constantly attack our civil liberties, the home office vomiting out repugnant, gestapo-like legislation on a seeming weekly basis.  They have used the banking crisis and the deficit as an excuse to sell off state assets, downsize the world-class welfare state we were once proud of and drive our economy towards a stagnant, top-heavy malaise where the rich get richer and the poor stay poor.  And through their collusion with the print media they have reconfigured the parameters of debate to such an extent that xenophobia, austerity, the classist demonisation of the poor and vulnerable, slavish militaristic patriotism and the ruthless, viscious lack of compassion that characterise their government is the new orthodoxy.  Labour lost the election by imitating them, and imitating them badly.

To compound this, the two political victories the conservatives have laid claim to in their last tenure - preventing Scottish independnce and rolling out marriage equality - were cross-party efforts.  The much-touted reduction of the deficit only looks good if you don't consider the human cost and the eventual economic costs as we transition away from a robust welfare state towards an unsustainable neoliberal sweatshop and corporate tax haven in the global race to the bottom.",null,0,null,1436996771,null,0,false,0,ct4n6h5,null,t3_3dey97,null,t1_ct4n6h5,null,t3_3dey97,null,null,null,1437882690,null,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20,null

We're screwed this season if we dont buy a striker, but if we buy Benteke im fairly certain we will be screwed long term by overpaying for a flawed, mediocre player who couldn't be further from a fit in our system under Rodgers.  

I'd truly love a CDM, especially Gonfalons who would really improve us but has a true love and loyalty towards Lyon, but I cannot see Rodgers signing one. Its fairly obvious he prefers to have two CMs/8's and a CAM/10, and not a CDM/6 on the field. 

I can see the left back, but I think the reason behind not being linked to one is Flanno hopefully rejoining the team soon as depth at both fullback spots, Moreno having just joined us as a pretty prolific signing and the fact that BR will switch to the 352 if needed.

Instead at the moment we have a horrible mishmash of conflicting goals and not enough money, along with massive wastage of funds (though this has improved over the last decade or so).

The reasoning behind having Aqua as the second card, despite it being aimed at poor credit scorers:

* You get 0.5% cashback on all spending
* Purchases in other currencies are charged at a ""perfect"" exchange rate. This means buying things online or in another country you pay the exchange rate with no bank charges or ""loading"", *and* get cashback for it.
* You get access to the full Noddle credit report system. This is pretty minor but it gives you some alerts and stuff that the free one doesn't.

I'm not claiming equivalence. I'm pointing out that the attitude that everyone who disagrees with you is somehow some idiot who's been brainwashed by the Daily Mail is a stupid argument.

&gt;you're pretty condescending yourself there, after inventing a strawman to be outraged by.

I'm sorry you didn't get the joke. It's quite well-known. I guess maybe it doesn't appear in the Scottish media eh?

&gt;you have a serious chip on your shoulder.

You're the one seemingly incapable of accepting that someone can have a different viewpoint of the SNP to the one you hold. I have never tried to say that *your* view of them is invalid, but you seem to think that anyone who thinks that Salmond is less than sainted is somehow a brainwashed fool. It's facile, and childish.

What about cycling to work? More dangerous than driving a car, so their accidents shouldn't be covered either. 

Sprained your ankle playing rugby? Shouldn't be playing such a violent sport. 

Oh, you work a more dangerous job than the typical office drone? you're not covered as either, working on a fishing trawler is a lifestyle choice, so you brought the injuries on yourself.

I'd rather keep it free for everyone, than risk having people, even overweight people, dying of treatable diseases for lack of money. When I lived in India you saw that kind of thing, and it's not something I think we should be trying to emulate. Aren't medical fees the leading cause of bankruptcy in America too? I don't fancy that either - I'd quite like to leave my house to my kids, instead of losing their entire inheritence when I get ill.

No - what I'd like is more tax (particularly in the higher bands) and national insurance contributions not to be capped. This would affect me too, as I'm in one of the higher tax bands, but it just seems fairer all round. A few percent tacked on to each of the upper tax bands isn't going to break the bank, and it helps everyone.

I'm the highest earner in my family at the moment - my little sister is just above minimum wage - I don't want to see her be unable to get good quality health care just because she's unlucky enough to be disabled and limited in the work she can do.

No, people, particularly higher earners, need to stop whining about how unfair it is that they might have to pay for treatment for other people, and understand that free healthcare is good for society as a whole, and what's good for society is also good for them - healthy worker aren't taking sick days, aren't having to claim benefits due to being too ill to work etc.",null,0,null,1436997418,null,0,1436998277,0,ct4nlcc,null,t3_3ddcvp,null,t1_ct4nlcc,null,t1_ct4iood,null,null,null,1437882984,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

They are popular bikes so the dealer knows it will sell fairly quickly. This means he has no real incentive to lower the price too much for you as the next guy may be willing to buy it for more and there will definitely be a next guy. (They are also very very tempting to thieves so take the appropriate precautions.) 

What you can do (and what I did) is get a full service, warranty and good deals on gear thrown in as well as any blemishes sorted out (they put new aftermarket bars and levers on mine). These are all things that cost them very little. If they get cost price for a shiny new helmet as a sweetener to sell a bike, it doesn't really matter to them. That said, you can always ask for money off the bike!

Don't be put off by mods. Do some reading and you will see that some are absolutely essential (3x3, jet, PAIR and solenoid removal, filter) and are very cheap and easy. You will be hard pressed to find a second hand DRZ that doesn't have these done. These don't affect the engine or reliability at all and are reversible. Mine had the 3x3, jetting and a full FMF exhaust system for example.

Engine mods (e cams, bigger cylinder etc.) are quite a bit rarer and more expensive to do and may even affect reliability (I have heard varying reports on this though) so for that reason I won't be buying one with a bigger capacity cylinder. That's just me though. 

If you really want a DRZ, head to the DRZ UK forum and look there. The folk there are really sound and know their stuff so you can be fairly sure of a sorted bike.

&gt;The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think-tank said that the Budget will actually make the poorest tenth of families in the country around ¬£800 a year worse off by 2019.

&gt;The next-poorest tenth of families will experience an even bigger loss, with their annual income slashed by ¬£1,100. Meanwhile, the richest 10 per cent of families will see their income fall by only ¬£350 a year, while the second-richest 10 per cent will lose virtually nothing.

&gt;‚ÄúThe changes overall are regressive ‚Äì taking much more from poorer households than richer ones,‚Äù concluded Paul Johnson, director of the IFS. Child poverty is expected to shoot up over the coming years due to the welfare cuts for those on low incomes, and critics also pointed out that the majority of losers from the Chancellor‚Äôs squeeze on tax credits will be people in work.

Any comment on that?

We have fullback that are great offensively, so we should let them be just that - offensive fuckers. The reason why I think it'll work better this season is because of Milner. I wasn't thrilled with the signing, but with both him and Henderson - I assume they'll play in box-to-box-roles - we're more likely to have one more man tracking the ball/man on counter attacks. 

Most importantly I just hope we can form a defensive four that we know plays week in and week out. I'd like to see a Mourinho-esq way of thinking here from Rodgers.

null,false,UnLondon,15,Jedinak,null,"I haven't always been a Palace fan, well I haven't even followed football closely for that long. Being from Australia, 'soccer' is a little less significant than it may be in other countries, and my childhood was spent following an AFL side. Eventually I wisened up and saw the beauty of european football especially after the 2006 world cup (I'm italian so it fits). Over a few years, I slowly engrossed myself into football more and more. I started following a local club, started coaching my brother's team and paid attention to all the talk by glory hunter aussies following top six clubs. Honestly, it annoyed me that everyone could just say they supported a team whilst barely watching any matches at all, thus I began to think about what sort of team would suit me. 
My first exposure to Crystal Palace was via Jedinak's transfer, as Australians don't usually make it as big as he did. Going to a little championship side was a new thing and sparked my interest. Interested in this strangely  named team, I did some research, confirming this was a team I agreed with, one that reflected my identity and could actually mean something to me. It was the integrity of the team; the fabulous culture and adoring fan support. The underdog status, the challenge of it all and the fact that no matter how many failures Palace faced, it has managed to come out the other said stronger, and possibly  with one of the best starting XI's in their history.
Yes, I may not be a long standing fan, but the team is just as important to me as if I was born into it. People struggle to understand why I would go for Palace when I could support any other prem team, but I suppose they miss the magic of it. Waking up a 3am to watch a streamed match isn't easy, and I honestly can't pull it off all the time, but it is worth the investment. 
I find it funny now, that one of my neighbouring suburbs is 'croydon' (coincidence I swear). 2 of my relatives are moving to an area just out of London for work, so I hope to attend a few matches one day. When I do, it will be this subreddit I come to for advice. 
I may not have been following palace for eons, but as a 19 year old, I have many years to come. I've started something now, my 12 year old brother tells people proudly he is a Palace fan, as do I. We both dream of the day we can visit selhurst and experience the atmosphere. Funnily enough, when I first saw a video of selhurst during a match, I thought it was awesome. Some may say it's a dump, but the people inside it make it infinitely more special that any other stadium.

My first visit to Selhurst Park was to watch a Wimbledon - United game. I think it was in the FA Cup many, many years ago. Beckham was just reaching to his prime and I met his mum at the game. Asked her for an autograph as well... no idea why.

Anyway, I first started supporting Palace late. I worked over the summer during secondary school for my friend's dad. As payment he bought me a season ticket in the family stand. This was the year when Dowie drove us up the table and we won promotion. I was at Cardiff when we beat West Ham. I got a season ticket the following year and was situated in the Lower Holmesdale, Block B. I was at The Valley when we got relegated.

I moved to the States shortly after and stayed there for many years, supporting Palace from afar. The only game shown on TV when I was there was our 2-2 draw with Villa in the FA Cup.

They were dark times.

Anyway, I returned to the UK during the middle of the 2010-2011 season. I went to a few games but didn't have enough money to get my season ticket back.

Until the start of last season.

I got a new season ticket, this time in the Main Stand, and have renewed for next season, same seats. I'll continue to do so as long as possible. I'm a bit too lazy to go back in the Holmesdale. I love singing, but value a good view of the pitch. I go to away games and get the atmosphere I love, while I get the view I love at home.

In terms of public transport it's got a few bus stops and that's it, so you'd be looking at a rail fare to one of the nearby coastal towns (Flint, Prestatyn or Rhyl), and then trying to figure out which buses to take from there, which might not be easy or cheap.

It's an easy enough journey once you're out of Liverpool, and it shouldn't be hard to find your way. Hop on the M53, then onto the A55 and off again at either junction 30 or 31, which are only a short distance from Bodfari.

Very kind words indeed. Matt Ritchie is always dangerous and will be pivotal next season.

The number 13 chap is Callum Wilson who is, quite frankly, brilliant. He's incredibly fast, strong like an Ox and can actually finish. He really puts himself about and will bully the last defender which comes across as 'douche things' to opponents but we love it. 

I did think it maybe wasn't your strongest line up due to it being a friendly and you're currently in the middle of your season but you played well. Goal was a good finished and you looked dangerous in parts.

Good luck for the rest of the season!

The post is a breach of the 12-point code, Surveillance Camera Commissioner Tony Porter said. He has contacted the Metropolitan Police. ""Under the code, images should only be used for their stated purpose - which for the police is to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour. Public disclosure of anyone's image for the purposes of fun is a clear breach of that.""
McKay said there was legal precedent that related to the McIntyre case. ""The courts have held the arbitrary publication of photographs by the police without a pressing need to do so is unlawful."" Taking the picture was not an issue, but the decision to post it online could cause problems.

* Share accommodation

* If you're going to drink, pre-drink (buy alcohol beforehand and drink it, meaning you only have a couple when you're out)

* Shop at Aldi, Lidl, Home Bargains, Poundland, and other discount retailers. A good one for non-fresh food online is Approved Food, I got a huge crate of food for ¬£40.

* Figure out when supermarkets reduce their prices on fresh goods (usually around 6pm in my experience) so you can get fresh food cheaper

* Make large batches of food and freeze it to eat through the week. If you buy meat in bulk it's usually cheaper.

* Apply for an HC1 certificate so you get prescriptions, dental care and so on for free (although you might not fulfil the residency requirements for this)

* Don't drive or take the bus when you can walk - saving money and getting healthier at the same time. 20-30 minutes' walk is really not that much.

* Get an 18-25 railcard. Some banks (RBS, Santander) will give you one just for having an account.

* With energy providers, deal with them directly (no agencies) and submit meter readings. This means you pay for what you use and nothing more.

* Wear thicker clothes in winter rather than putting the heating on all day.

* Find a private landlord rather than an agency - this should avoid you paying tenancy or agency fees when signing the lease.

* Learn to fix things - I fixed a washing machine, a window latch and a TV aerial in my second year in my flat and it didn't cost me a penny using manuals online.

* Get a savings account with a passbook that doesn't let you access your money readily. I have one with Virgin Money and to withdraw money I have to go into the branch and show the book, which means I can't take it out willy-nilly.

Yeah endurance athletes don't have a typical diet, but it still shows they have an important role in the body. If an endurance athlete requires a high amount, an average person should require an average amount.

Well yeah, considering nutritionist isn't a protected term in the UK I wouldn't really put much weight into what one said. However most dietitian's advice I've seen don't recommend a specific amount of carbohydrates they only recommend what proportion of food you should be eating daily.

null,false,RustledJimm,null,null,null,"He is asking why the tories tend to be hated more, or generate more vicious hate.

But the answer to that is simple. Lib Dems did were most hated for what they didn't do about tuition fees. Small matter, Lib Dems didn't do much else to be hated except be a scapegoat.

Labour were in power during an economic downturn and so took the blame for not planning for it. Remember the tories were in favour of more deregulation and often said the labour government weren't spending enough before the credit crunch. If the tories had been in power we would have seen the same reaction. Labour caused hate about the Iraq war. Something which hasn't affected a lot of us in a direct manner. Also general spying but tories do that even more so.

So why do the tories gather more hate? Because what they do causing hatred affects people more diretly. Doing well at the economy rarely affects people directly (or in a manner that can be seen directly) but in an indirect manner.

But when you see people you know or even your own family needing to go to a food bank because of decreases in support you get angry at the people who did this. When you see your ill friend crying their eyes out because its been deemed they are fit to work because they can walk for several meters you get angry at the people who put those rules in place and hired the company doing the testing (this one is also directed at Labour but more so the tories).  you hear about the economy getting better but all you see is your budget tightening. Wages are not rising but costs are.


And I'm not even going to begin on what the have done in the past that causes hatred because it'd take too long with thatcher.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Funny thing is, if you look at /r/britishproblems for example many uk redditors are perfectly happy to stereotype and rant against chavs, with varying degrees of seriousness.  I think you're getting evasive answers here not so much because you were tactless, or that people are touchy about opinions per se, as much as suddenly realising that if their opinions are transposed to a classroom setting, to an audience who can't contextualise them with their own experiences, they need to be backed up a whole lot more.  Trouble is, nobody can.

For starters, people are accustomed to their local area's chavilect, but not knowledgeable enough to confidently make statements about chav speech nationwide.  Probably a bigger problem is that chavs are like that famous judge's quote about pornography, [I know it when I see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it).  

IMHO one issue here is that chavs can't really be distinguished by speech features alone.  For example your stereotypical chav will consistently conjugate verbs ""incorrectly"" (""you was wrong"", ""I weren't even there"") but those traits are also common to heaps of northern dialects, pretty class-agnostically.  So realistically you're only going to pin 'chav' on someone through a combination of speech, appearance, behaviour.

Anyway I'm rambling but I guess my point is that people are probably just wary of giving casual non-linguist anecdotes that could be taken too weightily or what have you (despite non-linguist anecdotes being what you want, and you seem pretty capable of assessing them accordingly).

As for me, and given all the above waffly disclaimers, besides 'innit', I'd say one of the most distinctively chavvy speech traits is speaking with an (affected?) nasal tone.",null,0,null,1437003088,null,0,false,0,ct4qzi2,null,t3_3denf4,null,t1_ct4qzi2,null,t1_ct4pcm5,null,null,null,1437885711,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

Long story short, the terms were agreed between Lloris and United, but Levy was looking to Levy them for more cash, and what actually transpired with our combined *cunning* was that Spurs would help united in their quest to inflate the fee for De Gea, as long as we got a 25% cut of any increase in price. Which **WAS** essentially the plan.

Now some idiot is plastering it on facebook and it's posted here so obviously Madrid will find out and we will be screwed. Not only that but I'm pretty sure Levy will think I was the one that told everybody and probably won't speak to me again.

The best part of it was, I was going to be able to provide you guys with first hand ultra fresh details about the club. Specifically that although everyone knows about the two pitches in the new stadium, and how the grass rolls away for the NFL pitch, but Levy told me that the NFL pitch rolls away to reveal an ice-hockey rink, and he WAS gong to divulge information about what we will see once the hockey-rink rolls away but that clearly isn't going to happen now is it?

To put it bluntly, when people are trusted with facts like these about the club, it's completely unfair to post these on facebook because anyone could get the blame.

Also, I know what you fucks are like and you are going to think this is all made up. Do some fact checking and it's obvious. Lloris and De Gea are both REAL footballers, We ARE getting a new stadium with retractable pitches. Daniel Levy exists, Landrover Discoverys exist, I'm real because I'm posting this post as well.

Still sceptical? Read the facebook post again, the ITK (and he does know) clearly states it's ""quite the cunning plan"" and above I noted how me and Levy used our cunning (admittedly mostly his) which shows both our version of events clearly line up.

""How the CFTR mutation is passed through families
Genes come in pairs. You inherit one set of genes from your mother and one set from your father.
To develop cystic fibrosis you would have to inherit the faulty gene from both your mother and your father.
In the UK, it is thought that one person in every 25 carries the faulty gene for cystic fibrosis, which is why it is a relatively common genetic condition. A carrier is usually completely healthy and has no symptoms of cystic fibrosis.
If two carriers of the faulty gene have a baby, there is:
a one-in-four chance that the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes (the child will not have cystic fibrosis and will not be a carrier of the condition)
a one-in-two chance that the child will inherit one copy of the faulty gene from either their father or mother (the child will not have cystic fibrosis but will be a carrier of the condition)
a one-in-four chance that the child will inherit both copies of the faulty gene (the child will have cystic fibrosis)""

I think the reason why I hate the Conservative Party more than the Labour Party is because of the kind of people who are in it.

At least the old One Nation Tories had some sort of sense of Britain as an organic community with its own traditions which should be respected. These modern ones would happily sell the country to the highest bidder, if there was profit in it for themselves and their pals. They were young in the 80's and absorbed the toxic ideas of the time, Thatcherism and Yuppie-ism. 

And as if all that wasn't bad enough, Cameron, as soon as he was elected, made a really alarmingly authoritarian speech about the days of people being left alone as long as they don't break the law being over! It seems, like their ideological hero, Thatcher, they're on course to combine the worst of neoliberal capitalism with the worst of authoritarianism.

null,false,Cheese-n-Opinion,null,null,null,"This question is in danger of getting a lot of conflicting and obfuscating replies. Firstly, 'chav' is very nebulous, and loaded with classism. It can mean anything from specifically young, unkempt lads with criminal tendencies to basically the entire bottom rung on the British social ladder. I've also heard people claim that it refers simply to a dress-code and sub-culture that isn't necessarily dependant on wealth or class. It's my opinion that many people profess to using the term in the first and last sense whilst actually using it in the second for all intents and purposes.  

  I think a lot of this confusion over what the term 'chav' refers to is down to the fact that its only quite reently become nationally widespread. Before the turn of the millennium people used a host of different regional terms for various kinds of local subcultures of lower-class people, petty criminals or delinquent teenagers. Tabloid media helped rapidly spread the term and I suspect a lot of nuance was lost in the process.

  If you've read up on British English you'll understand that it can be viewed as a pyramid, with regional variation most extreme amongst the lower classes diminishing to a homogeneous 'posh accent' at the top of the heap. As such chav speech exhibits massive regional diversity. Anyone thinking of chavs as mostly lower-class might point out extreme regionalisms as chav-speak; anyone equating them with 'the youth of today' will give you neologisms and recent accent trends. Neither of these would be representative of a widespread and exclusively 'chavvy' dialect.

Don't get me wrong Benteke is an extremely good player, and better than Balotelli and Lambert, at the very least, but given that BR didn't really alter his style to accommodate Balotelli and Lambert, I have very little to believe that he will do likewise to accommodate Benteke. 

I accept that people want to believe that Benteke has been good despite the tactics of Villa, and will prosper even more under BR because of the change in style, but you can't escape the fact that this is also a big risk because we haven't seen him play other than how Villa have played him. His performances for Belgium in a team which adopts a similar style to Liverpool, he has been bang on average, even replaced by Origi at certain points.

I will try my best to help you understand.

""To develop cystic fibrosis you would have to inherit the faulty gene from both your mother and your father""

That line there is crucial. Members of the same family (siblings, cousins, etc) are more likely to share genetic material.
Therefore, for example, offspring from first-cousin marriages are more likely to have two copies of the same gene.

"" If two carriers of the faulty gene have a baby, there is: a one-in-four chance that the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes (the child will not have cystic fibrosis and will not be a carrier of the condition) a one-in-two chance that the child will inherit one copy of the faulty gene from either their father or mother (the child will not have cystic fibrosis but will be a carrier of the condition) a one-in-four chance that the child will inherit both copies of the faulty gene (the child will have cystic fibrosis)""

That paragraph above should illuminate the concept for you. If you still don't understand, I've added a link to help you come to grips with it. If after reading it, you still don't quite get it, just ask a professor at your local university who studies biology, they will be more than happy to help you out.

Correct.  The seeds were sown by Thatcher's bizarre right-to-buy policy and the subsequent failure to replace the sold off council house stock.  End result?  A slowly ticking bomb of there not being enough homes available.

A combination of Schengen and Blair's amazing open doors immigration policy meant additional strain on the housing stock was incoming.  Didn't help that 1998 was the year that house prices left the launchpad and took off.

Thanks to an army of foreign investors sniffing around London, and Gordon Brown knackering the pension market, we have seen BTL explode into a huge cancerous tumour.  House prices continue to rocket, private rents everywhere (and at silly prices too) and not enough housing stock being built to ease demand.

thats exactly what you said, you said the BBC is basically Clarksons dad and should tell him how to behave, without regard for the fact that hes a grown adult and can do that himself. Downvote and swear as much as you like to make yourself feel better about your loyalty to the great Clarkson.

&gt; But no no, the most logical and sensible explanation is a conspiracy to scrap the BBC right?

no thats exactly what a conservative policy is, the BBC is literally the opposite of what a tory government aims to be, smaller government and especially no government/tax payer funded media.

a normal meeting could mean anything, but why the secrecy? it is because they might have something in common. No of course not, dismiss all claims until the BBC is dismantled, all because you cry a little about a tax.

null,false,Public_Fire_Hazard,2,Ward,null,"I've ""supported"" palace since I was 7ish back in 04. I'm a Yorkshire lad but my Dad is from Croydon and I decided I'd get to see more games with him than doing the standard thing for here and support Leeds. I went to a few of the yorkshire away games like Sheffields, Leeds, Huddersfield, Barnsley, either with my Dad or whenever my aunt would come up from the south and take me since Dad worked out of the country. Most of the appeal was getting to have a day out, a pub lunch and to spend some time with my Dad since I didn't see him for weeks at a time round then.

I got properly into football during 09/10 season, and although I didn't quite understand it I was pissed off with the whole administration debacle and was worried about not having Palace to follow before the last final whistle of our season blew. I got the football fever during the World Cup, started learning the teams and who was who. 11/12 was a great one watching ""agueroooooooooOOOOO"" and whatnot, but the highlight was definitely Ambrose's goal against United in the cup. 

The promotion season was fun, although I accept the blame for our massive autumn winning streak coming to an end against Leeds due to it being my first time going to a palace game that season. Sinking Peterborough on the last day was fun at the time, but the train back up to Leeds went through Peterborough and seeing the dejected looks on their fans' faces was a sobering image that was what worried me most just before full kit wanker Pulis turned up next season. 

Wembley was a great day, I fucking hate Watford for some reason and the clearance off the line in the last minutes is what has caused me to rate Joel Ward as the best full back since Roberto Carlos. 

These past two years have just been amazing being able to actually watch our games every week, be it by going to the games whenever possible or streaming them when I can't. I love supporting Palace, and while there is always the looming disappointment of the inevitable crash, the premier league joy ride is leaving some great memories.

null,false,OhSuper,null,null,null,"I was 18 and finishing up high school. That was 6 years ago, and there has definitely been an upswing in football interest here in the US since, but back then I had a very tough time finding people to relate to, and that's frustrating when you really like something and there's nobody around you can talk with.

Anyway I got word that an English team in the Championship was doing a US preseason tour. And not only were they doing a preseason tour, they were going to play my local professional team who was in the third division of the US soccer ""pyramid"". I decided this was probably as close as I was going to get to English football any time soon so I had to go.

The only goal I remember in that game, which I believe ended 4-1 to Palace, was a Darren Ambrose free kick from outside the box probably less than 10 minutes in. I remember it looked very effortless. What I remember more than anything though was the fans.

Palace brought a good number of fans, more than I thought they would, and they set up behind the same goal the entire game. They had a few chants and songs and stood the entire first half. Most of the people I was sitting around found it nothing more than amusing. But I saw that and thought to myself, *that is what I want from football*. So I turned to my buddy who I was there with and said, ""I'm going up with them for the second half."" 

So that's what I did. It was a little out of my element and my friend and I mostly kept to ourselves in that standing section, but it felt very good to just finally be around people like that. I knew nothing about Crystal Palace, so I tried to listen in on some conversations to maybe gain some insight about the club- who their best players were, who they were thinking of signing, stuff like that. Never got the inside scoop, but I did hear something that has stuck with me vividly and basically sealed the deal for me as a Palace fan.

A man, probably in his early 30's and wearing a Palace jersey, was laughing with a few of his friends. He had his young son hanging off his arm, and he was watching the game intently. His son turned to him and asked if he thought they could win anything this year. 

Well his dad smiled at him and said in the most content of tones, ""Nope. We won't win anything this year"". 

Now this was before I had ever heard the term ""crisis club"", and it was before I learned that statements like this are funny to Palace fans in an ironic way, but that's not the part I was focusing on. That image of the father being there with his son, enjoying the average team they loved half a world away in a game that meant nothing has stuck with me ever since. To me, even without knowing a thing about them, Palace's values seemed to be reflected in the fans, and that's what I wanted. I figured if a club could make me feel something like that, than I knew straight away this was what I wanted football to mean to me. 

There was no way for me to watch the Championship in the States at the time but I did my best to follow Crystal Palace all that year and in the following years until they made it to the Premier League. Watching them on TV, in the Premier League no less, has been a luxury I wasn't sure I would be able to enjoy but they continue to surprise me. I suppose the next step is to get to Selhurst Park for a game. Until then I am happy to be a fan from afar.

null,false,northern_crusader,null,null,null,"OK lets look at some figures. 

Assume ¬£10,000 borrowed over 5 years at Santanders best rate of 3.9%. I'm only choosing Santander because I bank with them, no other reasons. Compare that to adding to a ¬£100,000 repayment mortgage at 3% with a remaining term of 20 years.

Bank loan: 60 payments of ¬£183.58 for a total of ¬£11014.80 so it costs you ¬£1014.80 to borrow.

Remortgage: Originally without the lending it would be ¬£560.13 a month for 240 payments repaying ¬£134431.20. Adding the ¬£10,000 would increase the payments by ¬£56.01 to ¬£616.14 a month for 240 months repaying ¬£147873.60.  

You would repay an extra ¬£13442.20 in interest for the remaining 20 year term so **it would cost you ¬£13,442.20 to borrow ¬£10,000** or ¬£3,442 more than you borrowed in the first place just to save ¬£127.57 for a month for the first 5 years but you'd be paying an extra ¬£56 a month for the following fifteen.

The other thing to consider is that mortgage interests can go up whereas most loans the interest is calculated up front and what it is when you take it out is what you pay until the end.

Whilst remortgaging to finance something appears at first look to be a great idea because its lower repayments, the amount it will actually cost you is usually more than you borrowed in the first place which is why banks and building societies absolutely love people who finance home improvements by remortgaging as they get to make 10 times the interest they would on a normal loan.

All the dinosaur scenes are dark and dimly-lit, with only the Pterodactyl scene featuring daylight, but on a dark, cloudy day.  GCI dinosaurs are more convincing at night in both works, but *Doctor Who* gets more dark scenes.

*Doctor Who* used practical effects for many of its dinosaur shots, so the effects team's efforts were divided among fewer CGI dinosaur shots.  The behind-the-scenes story on *Jurassic World*'s lighter use of animatronics was not fully disclosed, but the effects team has said director Colin Trevorrow had to fight for the inclusion of animatronics in the movie.

The bus you need for Bodfari is the number 14 from Mold Bus Station. To get to Mold, you'll have to take a bus from either Hawarden, Chester or Flint train stations. 

My preference is also Google's fastest suggestion, Liverpool &gt; Bidston &gt; Hawarden &gt; Mold. Don't cross the main road when you come up out of Hawarden station, you're already on the correct side to get the number 4 or the faster X44 bus to Mold.

If you want less changes, get the train to Chester, then one of many buses from outside the train station to Mold Bus Station. The X55 is probably the fastest, or the X44, but there's plenty of others to chose from.

That being said, he is a decent all-round striker and would probably offer a different approach to Sturridge, Origi and Ings.

Meanwhile Lacazette is more of a pacy, dribbling forward. Personally I think he would thrive because pacy, dribbling players tend to do quite well for us. He's not small, at 5'10 with a solid build he's quite strong as well, although not Benteke-level and his pace+strength+finishing+dribbling make for quite a complete forward. There is the argument that he is not PL-proven but Suarez came from a weaker league and scored on his debut.

b) The last time they increased the threshold, the government boasted about all the families that were taken out of tax altogether!  According to this [article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2925703/Eight-million-families-1-330-better-flagship-tax-plan-two-working-adults-double-benefit.html), at the current levels, 2.7 million people pay no income tax, so that'll be 2.7 million of the lowest paid workers who cannot possibly benefit from any changes to income tax thresholds, hence my statement that the tax threshold changes affect everyone *except* the [2.7 million] lowest paid workers!

""Raising the income tax threshold for the lowest paid"" is just the most ridiculous Orwellian doublespeak.

Raising the personal allowance from ¬£10600 to ¬£12500 is effectively just handing 20% of ¬£1900 = ¬£380 to every person in employment *except* the lowest paid.  It doesn't matter how rich you are, you're getting that extra ¬£380 per year by the end of the parliament *unless you're one of those 2.7 million lowest paid workers*.  Then there's the hundreds of thousands who earn between ¬£10600 and ¬£12500 who'll get some money, but less than ¬£380.  

If your aim was to give everyone in Britain except the very poorest more money, then you've succeeded.  If your aim was to help the lowest paid, you couldn't have failed more spectacularly.

This is absolutely an invaluable experience, especially for younger English players, and I think is something that goes understated when people here discuss loaning out players. 

At the risk of rubbing a chunk of this sub the wrong way (and painting with a broad brush), young English players (specifically ones attached to a Premier League club) are in a comfortable situation by virtue of the PL being ostensibly the best and arguably the most prolific football league in the world. They don't have to go anywhere.

It was after England got bounced from the last World Cup Chris Waddle talked about the value of his stint with Marseille  - not just in terms of success but in terms of personal growth as a man and as a footballer. 

Comparatively speaking, the club is bringing in kids as young as 14 from Africa, Brazil, and across the continent. These kids have to learn to adjust to life in a new city, away from friends, family, and comforts of home. All while adapting to new coaching styles and all the other trappings involved with moving clubs.

I'm not a football manager but if I knew Ruben was going to be a fringe player next season (say under 6 apps. total) I'd loan him out to a club like Fiorentina as 'payment' to settle this whole Salah deal, provided he actually makes consistent starts. There are a lot of sport and non-sport positives a young English player could glean from a stint in a competitive European league all which potentially have a positive impact on overall player development.

It would be really great if Chelsea had another consolidated development pipe. Vitesse is good, but it seems that at some point players begin to be loaned out to more competitive leagues. It would be great if the club had the capacity to get a chunk of players consistent play time at a club like a Frankfurt or Sampdoria in the way that it's done at Vitesse.

I'm sort of rambling here but I wish we were seeing more English players, at our club and across the country, loaned out to other clubs in Europe. I was really bummed when Spurs picked up Eric Dier. He had been with Sporting for like a decade at age 21.

tl;dr - If RLC gets loaned out anywhere, I hope it's Fiorentina for the reasons I mentioned above.

Started off in London, 5 days to be tourists and tour a couple of universities.  Rented a car and headed for Cambridge.  Next day on to Nottingham for one night.  Drove to Liverpool from there, where we spent 3 days.  From there it was on to Birmingham for a night, then Bournemouth for an evening (with the obligatory stop at Stonehenge).  From there it was back to London for 2 more nights, then back to America.
It was a wonderful trip and we have all fallen madly in love with England, especially Nottingham.  And the people in Liverpool were so funny that I hated to leave.

look, no one here is (or should be) trying to call the market, certainly not me. I'm not trying to tell you that house prices will plummet tomorrow.  what i am trying to tell you is that the very fact that you wrote 
&gt; the property is unlikely to lose value

i was a student in 2005/06, and so i saw more than my fair share of daytime tv.  approximately 90% of tv at the time was house price shows hosted by Sarah Beeny (exaggerating, but not that much). everyone was talking about how easy it was to make money in property - buy a house, paint over the cracks in the ceiling = ¬£100k profit. we're not at 90% today, but these shows are coming back, and the messages you hear from a lot of people (no insult meant to you or anyone else) don't appear to be based on anything other than price momentum. 

house prices, like many things, go up and down over time. if i came to you and said that a company's share price was unlikely to go down, what would you say in response?",null,0,null,1437031001,null,0,false,0,ct54j2a,null,t3_3dd5je,null,t1_ct54j2a,null,t1_ct46j2d,null,null,null,1440477586,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

They'll have you fill in a fairly long form with personal details plus job history so have company names and dates to hand. They will probably also want passport/ID to prove you're legal to work in the UK, so take that. 

I did admin stuff so was tested in word and excel. 

Agency bods like you to be well dressed, up-beat and super keen. It's a slightly strange atmos in their offices - they're essential selling people to companies and they want you to buy into all the pep and enthusiasm, which might feel weird if that's generally not your bag. It's a lot about making an impression on them. *Signing up with an agency is your interview for a job.*

They might have positions they're trying to fill that day, so you'll get lucky. They might not, so chase them - phone calls and emails to follow up. Be clear about what you need - your hourly rate, or if it's just the summer then they might not do short term gigs. I sometimes did maternity cover so ~9 month placements. Some places are familiar with students working during vacation (is that your deal?), some aren't. 

Pay attention to the vibe you get from them. They might not feel they can specifically help you but not say that directly. Never mind - you just trot up the high street and sign up with another one. 

I temped for years (poor me) but did have a good relationship with my agency. I was waiting outside for them to open one time I got made redundant and they were lovely. 

Edit: using agencies is a strange 'job' in itself, in a manner of speaking. You need to field phone calls, now what you need ¬£ph, say yes to them, have a very good reason for saying no. It's slightly weird but v helpful to have them selling you, instead of selling yourself. Generally, signing up to the agency counts as your interview for a job. They're the middleman so if they get you something you're already in.

This round of cuts is hitting just about every working person; its savage and will put millions of *working* people on or below the bread line; millions more will have to struggle where they were formerly, if not comfortable then coping. 

A lot of how this goes though depends on the economy. I expect it to contract far further than the 0.1% forecast by the OBR; I also believe the current recovery is incredible fragile given the situation in Europe, a likely move from Scotland to push for independence once more, the vote on EU membership, the broader global situation, etc.

Anyways; it has all convinced me to look more closely at Labour and the election candidates.

The sad thing is that you felt compelled to add that as part of your argument.

In arguments when I've defended statements about UKIP (because they were factually incorrect), I've had my  allegiances challenged.  I don't mind if people are passionate about something, but I hate it when people lie or fabricate evidence to support their argument. It seems that both ends of the political spectrum are just as guilty as each other.

People find it hard to separate facts from emotions, especially in politics. 

The thing I find the most scary is that UKIP were made to look like this giant scary boogeyman, yet the Tories seem to be the ones tearing the UK apart.

null,false,crazy_greg,null,null,null,"My advice from living as a student entirely on the student maintenance loan in an expensive city:
- Learn to cook from scratch. Cooking this way is much cheaper than cooking with packet sauces or buying ready-meals/take-away.

- If you can, go veggie. Vegetarian eating is much MUCH cheaper than omnivore eating.

- Go shopping in the evening (about 5pm, but varies form shop to shop) or, even better, if they close early on a sunday afternoon go then. You can get over 2/3s discount on fresh meat, vegetables, bread that are on their sell-buy date and freeze them or cook them that day.

- Walk everywhere. If you're in a city this should be easy enough. I used to walk across Bath, it took about 45 mins to get to lectures but it saved a fortune in bus fees.

- Share a house with friends. Yeah they'll piss you off sometimes, but it's much cheaper.

- Use charity shops. It might feel odd, but suck up that pride when you need anything! New clothes, check. New cookery stuff, check. There's nothing wrong with it most of the time.

- Don't drink or drink rarely. The number of people I saw who's spent their entire student loan for the term half way through by spending ¬£20 a night drinking was insane. Seriously ¬£20 was about 3 weeks of food for me.


Ok now for poor man's cooking 101:

Meat Sauce: Fry discount mince, onions and garlic (either the biggest pack you can buy for bulk discounts then freeze it, or going out of date and bough at a discount) in a little oil (Asian shops are great for cheap oil and spices). Keep stirring that stuff around so it doesn't stick until all of the meat is a light brown not pink. Add tinned tomatoes and beef stock cubes (~2 tins of toms and 1 stock cube per 250g of meat). At this point if I have any I'll add dried chill as well (you can buy this super cheap in asian stores as well, I bought a pot for ¬£2 and it lasted me for 3 years! and I use Chilli in EVERYTHING!). Let that boil up for a bit then cool it and freeze in individual portions, don't be too generous with your portion sizes here!

Spaghetti bolognase: Cook pasta according to packet instructions. Defrost or re-heat your meat sauce, adding dried italian herbs. Done.

Chilli con Carne: Cook rice according to packet instructions: Defrost/reheat your meat sauce with half a tin of kidney beans and as much chilli or chilli powder as you like. Done.

Keema Curry: Cook rice according to packet instructions: Defrost/reheat your meat sauce with half a tin of chickpeas, a handful of frozen peas and some curry powder.  Done.

This stops the same meal getting boring as hell without making something new every single night.

Poor man's vegetable stew. I used to make this one a lot in winter because the Co-op near where I lived used to have stewing packs of vegetables reduced to 33p for a kilo of veg frequently. It saw me through several winter's where I was dirt poor.
Chop up your kilo of mixed veg (any root veg works well here, carrots, onions, swede, turnips, you name it. If it's going out of date and it's a vegetable, chuck it in!). Don't both peeling them, just give the skins a good scrub in hot water (waste not want not). Add to this 500g of potatoes and 2 tins of chickpeas/kidney beans/berlotti beans (anything with some cheap protein in!). Chuck it all in a big pot with enough water to cover the veg and a couple of vegetable stock cubes. Boil it until the veg is soft. Done.

Be willing to be flexible and try anything once. If it's cheap then just buy it, you can google how to cook anything these days.

null,false,Dokky,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire (West Riding),null,"&gt; In England, pine martens are extremely rare, and long considered probably extinct. A scat found at Kidland Forest in Northumberland in June 2010 may represent either a recolonisation from Scotland, or a relict population that has escaped notice previously.[5] There have been numerous reported sightings of pine martens in Cumbria, however, it was not until 2011 that concrete proof ‚Äì some scat that was DNA tested ‚Äì was found.[6] There is also a small Welsh population. Scat found in Cwm Rheidol forest in 2007 was confirmed to be from a pine marten using DNA testing. A male was found in 2012 as road-kill near Newtown, Powys. This was the first confirmed sighting in Wales of the species, living or dead, since 1971.

When I left, I pushed the bike down on to the road, down the lip of the kerb. The angle was shit, and the bike toppled.   
The only thing that prevented damage was the fact it could only topple over 6 inches, because the bicycle rail was still beside it.

I then dropped my bike a few weeks ago, when I stopped to put waterproofs on.  
I jumped off the bike, and then discovered I'd forgotten to put my sidestand down.

&gt; Anyone else ever feel like their helmet is going to blow off? 

Yup. I'll just do a quick sanity check that the buckle is secure and then ignore it.

&gt; What's the etiquette for when you get to a red light?

Depends. At a junction? I'll filter up to the line, then pull off once the light changes - a car is not keeping up with me unless it's suped up.  
At a crossing, I'll still pull up beside, but when it changes, I'll not fly off; I'll keep in line with the car beside. Or, if there's enough space before I get to the line, I'll tuck in behind them.

A lot of filtering is grey area, and a lot of what we do are definite highway code no-nos. But, unless you act like a tool, the police will turn a blind eye. Unless they're having a bad day, and need to take it out on the first naughty person they see... [not had that happen to me yet, though]

null,false,PhysS,cnty-wales,English Liberal in Wales,null,"Well I have had a look at the election voting data and it looks as though the collapse of the Lib Dems was a boon for the Conservatives. The party that gained the most from the Lib Dems seems to be the Conservatives. The seats Labour won from the Lib Dems (12) showed that Labour won convincingly and most Lib Dems went to Labour. But in seats the Conservatives won from the Lib Dems (27) show a large increase in Green votes and the Tories gain was higher than the Labour. In constituencies which didn't change hands whoever held the seat gained the most, as the Conservatives held more English and Welsh seats before in the last election they benefited the most. And don't forget 20% of Lib Dems were in Scotland, a significant amount of their vote collapse occurred there. Of course we won't know exactly the effect or how big until there are polls looking at how former Lib Dem voters voted this election but the vote counts and swings in individual constituencies suggests Labour didn't gain as much as the Tories from the Lib Dem collapse.

It may be simplistic but the fact the public liked left wing policies shows that in the public eyes there is nothing wrong with being left wing. The media seem to think the public would never vote for someone with left wing ideas but they actually like such policies. I don't understand how that doesn't show that having a left wing leader is actually electorally wise, it's what people want!

When I was talking about FPTP I wasn't advocating for a Labour government or anything of the sort, I was commenting on the fact that such a ridiculous system would allow a party's seats to decrease by ~ 17% despite getting more votes. The FPTP system is making it look like Labour lost badly but they didn't.

Considering that all the polls before the election were consistent despite using different methods and different questions suggests it wasn't a problem with the method, otherwise all the methods were wrong. If the only poll that showed the Conservative win was the Conservative's poll, which hasn't been made public, I just don't believe it.

In claiming the perception as the party of business (whether they deserve it is of course up to you but the public do tend to trust them on the economy) they generally use rhetoric that favours economic efficiency over compassion. Labour has the perception of the party of the workers (or benefits scroungers depending on who you talk to) and their rhetoric attempts to reflect this. They attempt to appear more compassionate whilst sacrificing the image of competence with the economy somewhat. 
Because of the Tories focus on the economy they are also seen to favour the rich. They're belief is that if the the taxes for the rich are too high then they are rich enough to be able to take it over seas to tax havens. They think it is better to lower the taxes so there isn't any point in doing this. This has proven true but many are concerned that the rich are not paying their fair share. 
There radicals on the left who believe that the Tories are attempting to destroy the working class (just as their are radicals on the right who believe labour are trying to destroy the culture of the country). There does seem to be a lot of radicals on the left but this is understandable. Britain was a socialist country until 1979. It's only since then that the middle ground has been shifting to the right. Many people raised before 1979 probably hold to their beliefs of socialism and pass it down to their kids (along with the 'us vs them' mentally that gripped both sides of the political spectrum during the eighties. Maybe the right don't hold as much resentment over this because they are seen to have 'won' with the shifting of the middle ground to the right). The Young tend to be more idealistic and passionate as well. People below a certain age tend to believe that people are good and honest at heart and deserve help with solution that may been seen as 'quick fixes' that only work in the short term by those on the right.

&gt; very difficult system to replicate in many other countries

&gt; Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programmes. The increasingly large private sector provides care to those who are privately insured

&gt; the government ensures affordability of healthcare within the public health system

&gt; key principle of Singapore's national health scheme is that no medical service is provided free of charge, regardless of the level of subsidy, even within the public healthcare system

I think David Cameron is one of the best conservative politicians of all time. People vote for him and trust him when the same can't be said for the rest of his party. Look at the approval ratings for Cameron as opposed to the rest of his party. He manages to appear approachable yet have a certain degree of swagger. If you asked the average person, ""Who had a bigger majority in government, Cameron or John Major?"" I think most would get it wrong.

The screaming and cheering about how much they had helped the poor with the latest budget is rather uncomely when the new budget clearly reduces what the poor have. It's like they think they are pulling a rouse over 'the dopey poor' when we all know who will take the burden of conservative cuts.

I'm willing to bet refusal to hand over the keys will be followed with accusations of closet Wahhabism and then legal action.
