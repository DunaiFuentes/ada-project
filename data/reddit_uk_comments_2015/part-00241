And it looks like they've taken nearly the exact same approach to last season in their transfer dealings. Buy several players from lower-finishing English teams (Lallana and co, last year, Dan Ings and Nate Clyne this year), take a chance on an unproven foreign talent from another league and pay a pretty penny for him (Firmino/Markovic) and completely overshadow everything with a player known for making a mess in the media (Balotelli/Sterling).

Why Clyne wants to be involved when he can walk into the United squad and revive his partnership with Luke Shaw is beyond me. His loss. It's clear to me that he's not leaving for footballing reasons. I think Liverpool are offering a large contract and he's taking the bait. Poor soul.

If it's merely an arrangement, they are just one of a vast number of potential matches, and you should be able to find someone in the UK. The only reasons to bring in someone from rural Pakistan is because you want a nice obedient wife that will do what you say, or to negotiate your 'home' village's family politics. I don't think either reason is one our immigration system should accommodate.

As for EU migration, I'm glad you accept that a large majority of Eastern European immigration is low skilled. In fact, almost a third is in ""elementary"" jobs of the very lowest skill. Together with unskilled immigrants of other backgrounds, low skilled immigrants are well over a million. You can splice it into different groups and say each one doesn't account for much, but that's then not seeing the wood for trees.

Other industries (finance, I.T. etc) love a good engineering degree and pinch all the best graduates, offering far better pay levels. The result is increasingly the only ones who stay in civil engineering are those who can't get a job elsewhere (those with 2:2s and 3rds which many engineering firms accept).

Having always dreamed of being an engineer I ignored the better offers and started out as an engineer for a firm (actually one Network Rail use), however I got sick of the low pay and working with the sort of people the industry attracts, so eventually I switched too (thereby continuing the downward spiral).

This is simply not true. A business always wants to reduce costs, and today it is estimated that human wages take up about ~33% of total business costs. Machines only cost their initial price and then the electricity they take to run. Humans cost wages and insurance and human resources and food and require time off and get sick and that isn't even counting the *mistakes* that humans continually make. Machines don't get tired or stupid or angry, they never require moral boosts and don't make mistakes or get emotional.

From a business perspective machines are better than humans in every way, all that needs to happen is for a machine to be created that has human level intelligence. Then we are all pretty much boned, unless society responds by implementing some form of comprehensive socialism.

null,false,griznok,eng-durham,Durham,null,"Wind power is actually more predictable than demand 24 hours in advance. The spinning reserve you are referring to is mainly required for when a large power plant fails, such as a large gas or nuclear plant. At which point the spinning reserve is brought on to maintain the frequency at a constant 50Hz. so if a 1GW nuclear plant is running, you need 1GW of spinning reserve just in case a fire breaks out or something similar.  

Wind power on the other hand is not going to all fall off the grid at the same time since it's distributed, so a much lower Spinning reserve is required. A reserve capacity on the grid is required for periods of low wind, however these are taken into account in forward planning for grid balancing, and traders have become very good at predicting these variations. 

AS for the price, Onshore wind is now one of the cheapest sources of electricity, especially when external factors such as pollution or security are taken into account. Offshore wind is aiming for a Strike price of around £100/MWh by 2020 and below the strike price of nuclear before Hinkley C even begins construction in 2023 (likely to be delayed at massive additional cost).",null,0,null,1435237409,null,0,false,0,csi6ajo,null,t3_3b0q06,null,t1_csi6ajo,null,t1_csi27fs,null,null,null,1437337034,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,haloraptor,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"I'm not convinced that immigration is our problem, though. I think our problem is a history of chronic underinvestment - this is certainly the case in Wales. There has been a lot of immigration to the places which see the most investment, which in turn increases the levels of investment in infrastructure in these places, which makes them a more attractive option for migrants.

I think the issue with immigration is that it is largely directed to one particular region of the country, which contributes to a perception of rapidly changing national demographics which actually isn't that rapid or that much of a change - it's just concentrated. People hear things like 'BMEs account for x in 5 Britons in London' and apply it across the whole of the country, assuming that there has been a massive demographic change across the whole of the UK.

Wales is 95% white British. If we spread out immigration of all kinds throughout the country, and increased infrastructure investments across the island in a similar way, we would see much more integration and cohesion, with a resultant increase in economic activity in these regions. 

I don't think the total numbers are a problem, basically. I think the problem is where they've all gone.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"It's not though, those are just words that you've said. Considering immigrants themselves are a resource that we can tax the only real argument that stands up to scrutiny is that there isn't physically enough space to put everyone, and we're a long long long way off reaching spatial capacity. 

In your comment below you mention hospitals, schools, houses. Two of these are paid for by taxation and immigrants (at least those from the EU. We get control over the entry of anyone else) are a source of revenue for the treasury. They don't put strain on the system, they just warrant its expansion. The problem is that the government expects the health service to function just as well with less funding per head (NHS funding is capped while the population grows). The same has happened with education funding. The issue is government funding and more fundamentally economics, immigration is something that's easy to blame but a reduction is a treatment of the symptoms, not the problem. We'd likely end up in the same situation sans immigrants a few years down the line, except it would be exacerbated by the economic harm caused by shifting the country's average age upwards and putting proportionally more strain on things like healthcare compared to taxable income from young workers.

To get the best out of Firmino's end product and creativity I've put him as a secondary striker where he'll look to create and score. 

Coutinho will play more of a creator role as his goal output is fairly weak. He'll have license to cut into the middle and play a tradition 10 if Firmino and Sturridge push up, effectively turning the formation into a diamond. He can also go wide if the situation demands it. 

Can/Lucas would be the holding player with Henderson and Milner the engines either side. Milner and Henderson being box-to-box supporting both attack and defense.

The fullbacks would push up more to compensate for a lack of width.

IMO class is an amalgamation of your role in society, your manners, your attitude to and level of education, the manner of your acquisition of money, and probably some other things too like how you socialise and how you spend your money.

So, a footballer on several £million can be working class and an out of work solicitor who's on JSA can be upper-middle class. You can be upper class and living in a gutter teaching rats why you'll only normally drink Chateauneuf-du-Pape but as rubbing alcohol is all you have that'll have to do.

You're a plumber and you earn £100k p.a. you're probably still working class unless you go to work in a shirt and tie and take your doctor wife to the opera in which case you're probably middle class.

You clean toilets and earn minimum wage but your mum is an Oxford professor then you're probably middle class. But if your mum cleaned toilets herself instead of being a professor then you're probably working class.

I think a good deal of it is about perception too.

Basically, they're as realistic as we want them to be. That seems like a kind of dodgy answer, but it's not that way on purpose. Like anything, it will be more expensive to get it all started properly than it will be once it's done. There's a role for GM of a number of different kinds.

Some power issues can be dealt with using solar panels attached to the buildings. It is a power intensive method but there are also ways of getting natural light into the buildings too, using shafts and mirrors. It's not as easy or as simple as just farming the land, but we've been doing that for quite a long time now and if we can find a better way (i.e. one requiring less land, and with a lower ecological impact, that can provide as much/more food) we should do that.

It will probably all end up being moot, since global population will probably hit a peak and then start to decline once the developing world stops 'developing' and becomes 'developed', with all its attendant problems.

That is complete nonsense. 

&gt;The UK's food production is always going to be negligible on a global scale,

Is France's food production negligible? And Germany's? And Italy's? If the whole of Europe stopped growing food the world would notice. Every country needs to contribute to global food production. 

You underestimate how much food we actually produce in the UK. We are one of the biggest producers in many agricultural sectors in Europe. If we cut our production, someone else would have to make up the shortfall. 

&gt;Trying to be protectionist with our land might help our domestic food production, but would hinder global food production if it hinders countries which have a comparative advantage over us.

The whole world is facing the same problems of food shortages and population growth. Your solution to cut food production is dangerous and selfish, and will lead to food shortages and starvation in poorer parts of the world. Whats more your suggestion that the UK should replace its agriculture industry with more urbanization is particularly foolish, as other than Malta, the UK is the most densely populated country in Europe, making it the last country that should be considering such action.

null,false,ctp95,lfc55,,null,"All good points but I'll just say:

- Henderson is 25, entering his prime and clearly has the temperament to be a captain and a leader. The performances across the board were shite last season but his head and effort never dipped, at least not that I saw. Also, it's tough to show good leadership when there's an established legend like Gerrard ahead of you. Hendo will be the main man now, and I've seen nothing to suggest that he won't rise to the occasion. 

- Rodgers has to get it right out of the gate or he'll be sacked in short order. We know it, the players likely know it and he definitely knows it after this review and nearly losing his job at Christmas. Klopp is likely to still be lurking about so nobody will want to get it right more than Brendan. 

- Striker is almost certain to be signed based on rumours from Pearce and other reliable sources. I'll also go out on a limb and say it wouldn't be the end of the world if Skrtel was sold. He's a good defender but he's been part of defences that have shipped 50 and 40+ goals in consecutive seasons. A younger, more stable defender might be a good thing but I do think Skrtel will likely be re-signed.

I'm not exactly hype for next season but I see very little to dislike from any of these signings. Also, I fully predict that we'll see a couple of current squad players kick on and fulfill their potential. My money is on Lallana, as his problems last season were largely caused by injuries and resultant rustiness, and Moreno, who showed flashes of real brilliance but I feel needed a bit more time to adjust to the new league and style of play.

I'm doubting your application of it in this case. 

&gt;Why? Does every country need to contribute to global car production?

The demand for cars is much smaller than the demand for food. The UN said in its report that I linked to earlier that ALL countries need to be contributing. Again you underestimate the amount of food that the UK produces. There are 65 million people in the UK. 

Even if we accept the basic idea of your proposal, it is completely unworkable in the real world. Do you really think the people of the UK are ever going to accept becoming the housing estate of Europe? You have quite a sad view of the country you live in to be honest, to relegate it to such a thing. The UK is a world leader in many aspects of agriculture, and many types of produce.

null,false,for_shaaame,null,null,null,"Yeah, but you don't just get to walk in there and review the entire list because you're curious.

For a start, do you have any formal legal training at all?  Or are you, as I suspect, a legal layman?  If the latter, how do you plan to ensure that the detentions are lawful simply by looking at a list of prisoners?  Even if a prisoner were being confined unlawfully, would you know the difference?  

The process of charging, convicting, sentencing, and managing prisoners is controlled by a complex collection of common law, case law, primary legislation such as Acts of Parliament and secondary legislation such as Orders, Regulations, and Codes of Practice.  Some solicitors dedicate their careers to the understanding of these rules.  What knowledge of these do you have?  How would you be able to apply that knowledge to a list of prisoners?  Do you have the time to dedicate to reviewing each individual case (there could be hundreds in your chosen prison, each of which might run to hundreds of pages of evidence and trial and sentencing reports) and cross-checking all the details against the rules governing detention?  Moreover, when detention is decided by judges who frequently have decades of experience with criminal law... why would you want to?  What commentary of practical value could you possibly have to add to the decisions of legal experts?

Secondly, it is the responsibility of the prison service to weigh the benefits gained from letting just anybody walk in and look at the list of prisoners, and the very real risks to personal information which that incurs.  The prison service is bound by the Data Protection Act, and names and addresses - even of prisoners - are personal information and therefore protected by the Act.  Moreover, some prisoners - especially organised gang members - might not want just anybody finding out where they are.  Indeed, they may have some very dangerous enemies outside of prison.  And some people are imprisoned for very emotive offences such as child abuse.  The risk of vigilante justice by some nutjob is too high to have that information available to just anyone.

Given the two above, why would they give just anyone access to prisoner information?  Given that 99.9% of the public will not have the knowledge necessary to help anyone inside the prison, it's far more likely that any such ""right"" would be abused by those wishing to harm the prisoners, either in prison or on their release.  I think it's far more likely that you're just looking to sate your own curiosity, rather than having a true altruistic aim in mind, and you've confused ""today's whim"" with a ""right"".

Lastly, each prisoner has access to free and independent legal advice.  They each have access to their own private legally trained solicitor to represent them.  I don't know what you think you're going to achieve by just walking in there as a layman and looking at a list of names when each individual prisoner has access to a solicitor.

&gt;it is impossible to find out if they are being confined lawfully or not.

To ensure that prisoners are confined lawfully is not your responsibility.

The campus itself isn't very big. Pretty easy to find your way around after a while. Uni is at the top of the hill, whereas the town is at the bottom. You can walk down (~20 mins) or take a short bus ride to town from Uni :) there's a number of canteens on campus to get food from, though some of my friends got sick of the food after a while. 

Bath has a really chilled/relaxed feel to it (compared to London, Singapore, etc.) It's quite a pretty town and there's lots of historical/architectural tourist attractions (eg: Roman Baths, Royal Crescent, etc) that BathUni students can visit for free. Relatively small city centre, but there's enough shops to keep you occupied if you want to have a snoop around. Fairly easy to find your way around as well. 

International students make up one-third of the student population in Bath so you don't need to worry about sticking out, hahah. Everyone is generally friendly, as long as you make the effort to talk/make friends. I was the only Asian in my flat during first year. All of my flatmates were really friendly and nice! We all always tried to organize little flat outings together which was fun. A piece of advice would be to not be intimidated/afraid of making the first move (in terms of friendship lol). Some people might take a while to warm up to you, but it's worth the effort. 

Another tip for making friends is to join societies / clubs. Really easy way to make friends as there's already a common interest. Another noteworthy thing was a weekly cafe called Globe, which I attended. It's basically a cafe-lunch thing where international students can get to know British students over free lunch. Made lots of friends there, including people from England, Malaysia, Italy, China, etc. Really recommend that you go for it :)

So we should stop teaching people about atrocities committed in the past because they were committed by the race you belong to? You seem to be assuming that teaching these subjects would burden today's population with the moral responsibility of the atrocities committed by a previous generation just because they belong to the same race, which is racist in and of itself. 

&gt;Teaching children that all cultures are equal and worthy of respect, no matter how backwards, criminal or discriminatory a culture is. 

So you don't want to teach children about the culture that permitted atrocities in the past, due to a different moral compass that existed at the time, compared to today. Yet you do want to enlighten the masses about the corrupt moral compass that exists in other cultures of today?

There are approx 1.9 billion muslims in the world.

null,false,amanafart,null,null,null,"&gt; So we should stop teaching people about atrocities committed in the past because they were committed by the race you belong to? 

No, we should teach about the atrocities and wonders equally, without framing Europeans as some kind of uniquely evil race that did something that no one has ever did before. For example, focusing on the Transatlantic slave trade while largely ignoring the numerous Arab slave trades is very disingenuous and suspect. 

&gt;You seem to be assuming that teaching these subjects would burden today's population with the moral responsibility of the atrocities committed by a previous generation just because they belong to the same race

That's not what I'm assuming, it's what the postmodernist historians and sociologists actually believe. They teach that whites need to atone for the sins of their ancestors and provide all manner of help to the previously disadvantaged groups at their own expense. It does indeed burden the white population with undue responsibility, since such scholars consider whiteness in itself to be a problem and the main cause for all the racism and hate in the world. 

&gt;So you don't want to teach children about the culture that permitted atrocities in the past, due to a different moral compass that existed at the time. Yet you do want to enlighten the masses about the corrupt moral compass that exists in other cultures of today?

I want them taught about all manner of atrocious things without focusing on the sins of their fathers.

&gt;There are approx 1.9 billion muslims in the world. Estimates for the number of fighters that ISIS have ranges from 9,000 to 200,000. Now, that 200,000 figure is a bit extreme, but it includes lots of ""support"" personnel that wouldn't really be considered ""fighters"", but let's go with that figure anyway, even though it seems absurdly high. So, out of 1.9 billion muslims, let's be really generous to you and say that 200,000 of them are ISIS fighters. That's 0.01%.

Hah, you consider only ISIS to be the extremist muslims? You don't know much about Wahhabism, do you? By the way, the majority of all islamist terrorist acts in the world were not committed by members of ISIS. FGM in Britain and elsewhere is not being done by ISIS.

An admin fuck up meant I didn't get the place but I managed to get onto a 2 year part time course called ""HNC in computing and systems"" through the clearing system. After the first year I reapplied for the full time foundation degree and got accepted. I did some programming in the part time course so I had a good foundation when going into the full time course.

The biggest obstacles during the course were the modules that were unrelated to programming/technical stuff. In the first year this wasn't an issue but in the second year you are forced to do things like ""Employ-ability"", which involved writing an essay on the legal issues surrounding the software industry. These modules actually count towards your overall grade which is frustrating, I want to be a software engineer not a fucking software industry lawyer!

It was still a good course, and if you actually enjoy programming you will do much better at it. I spend a lot of my free time programming video games and stuff so the actual programming we did during the course didn't seem that complex. If you have anymore questions feel free to ask and good luck!

Resulting in angry young men, who, without a sense of cultural or community belonging, formed gangs. The targeting of young white girls comes from the fact that in most Asian countries being pale is seen as a mark of beauty. Their lack of any moral compass comes from a lack of education and a lack of cultural cohesion. It is a sad fact that without institutional systems to keep them under control pretty much all people become murderers and rapists.

Yep. Our fault as per usual. It's our government's fault, our society's fault. Britain's fault. Absolve anyone of any responsibility for their actions, as per usual.

&gt;The targeting of young white girls comes from the fact that in most Asian countries being pale is seen as a mark of beauty.

Or could it simply be racism? That non Muslim white girls are of inherently lesser value than a Pakistani Muslim girl?

The headteacher implicated in the Trojan horse scandal said exactly the same in secretly recorded undercover footage shown on Panorama.

That's the attitude which is core to the targeting of white girls, not a fucking cultural attraction in the 'beauty of pale skin'.

These men belong to a faith that is rife with misogyny. If Muslim women are of less value than Muslim men, then what does that make non Muslim white women?

&gt;It is a sad fact that without institutional systems to keep them under control pretty much all people become murderers and rapists.

I'm not saying the state should prevent you from marrying someone. I'm just saying we should provide spouse visas on that basis. How do you police it? You require people to state whether it is an arranged marriage or not on the visa form, and enforce current penalties on falsification of immigration documents. 

&gt; Of course becoming a higher-skill economy is a good aim, that doesn't mean all low-skilled jobs will disappear. For the foreseeable future there will be many low-skilled jobs available.

If you limit low skilled immigration, low skilled jobs will disappear more quickly. We'll still have some low skilled jobs that are essential for society to work, but plenty of Brits needed to do them.

&gt; I'm not sure how much I believe that there are British workers willing to do some of these low skilled jobs. A lot of these jobs involve a lot of manual labour, long-hours and crap pay. I'm just not convinced that there are a million Brits willing to do that, that don't currently have jobs.

There are two types of these crappy jobs: ones that only exist because we import unskilled people in huge numbers, and ones that will exist because they are essential for UK society to function.  If the former disappear due to fewer unskilled immigrants, that's fine. It means we're becoming a higher-skilled economy. If there are not enough immigrants to fill the latter, wages and conditions will raise in those jobs until Brits are willing to do them.

So yeah, that's difficult to wipe out, but we can't pretend it doesn't exist. 

The Tory argument would be that for the vast majority, there *are* jobs available and those that are structurally unemployed can be retrained and find jobs in other industries, so a builder might become a plumber.  If we focus resources on fewer people we can help more people into work. In the end you're left with people who don't want to retrain to become employable (e.g. our hypothetical builder doesn't want to become a plumber).  These are the people you have to give an extra push to so they don't become a drag on the taxpayer and the wider economy.  In summary, you should be able to reduce structural unemployment over time, but never really wipe it out.

Of course, you'll have genuine cases of people who for some reason cannot retrain (e.g. close to retirement), and who are genuinely unable to work.

That's the whole point of the Lords. Public accountability works both ways, in some ways it makes a Government that reflects the will of the people, in others it makes a house in Government that is incredibly susceptible to media hysteria and putting forth bad policy to appeal to the masses. That's why the majority of countries have two houses.

That's why I think the Lords is good, you think half the promises made by the democratically elected commons before the election were made with the country in mind or a mindless appeal for votes? 

Again, are you angry that the man who runs the NHS isn't elected? Probably not, I'm sure you'd agree that appointing a man who's worked in the NHS since 1988 and doesn't have to worry about being ousted from power every five years is a good thing.

Basically Britain can either enter the Free Trade Area, or renegotiate a separate trade deal with the EU.  Entry into the FTA is our ideal situation, it means that trade can continue unabated.  The biggest problem though would be that we don't know how long it would take for Britain to enter, whether it would take a day or longer, possibly weeks.  Sure it doesn't make economic sense to withhold trade, just like it didn't make sense for Britain and Ireland to have a Trade War in the 30's.  Most of the EU isn't particularly fond of British whining, so it'd be a major shock if they're denied entry into the FTA, but taking time to ratify that entry would still hurt the economy.

The other option, Britain having a fresh trade treaty with a EU.  The problem here is that the negotiations would not involve the European Parliament, they would be between Westminster and the European Commission with influence coming from the French, German, and Belgian governments.  So who's going to speak for Ireland?  North-South trade would not be ignored, but it might not get the attention that we need it to get.

If you look at this years general election 36.8% voted conservative and 12.6% voted UKIP... so actually you're looking at about 50% voting for the right once NI parties are included. I'd also argue that part of the labour vote (i.e. new labour) is in many respects closer to the right than the left in its ideology.  Even in Blairs 1997 landslide he still only won 43.2% of the vote. Ultimately the winner is based on MPs rather than vote shares - and when it comes to MPs the conservatives obviously did win a majority - so I don't really agree with you. 

&gt; unless by ""we"" you mean anyone who voted Tory, in which case you're obviously right. 

That was clearly my inference... but I actually meant as a nation. If you look at the vote in Scotland they rejected labour, knowing that raised the prospect of dividing the labour vote and installing a Tory government. They chose to do it anyway because they wanted to be represented in Westminster as a single bloc of Scots - and that's what they got. 

At any rate - my point was it doesn't matter how many people you gather in a protest, how many twitter followers you have or how angry your articles in the guardian are... austerity is the path we are on and that isn't going to change because of Charlotte Church.

£29m Roberto Firmino deal puts spotlight on Liverpool transfer policy

Tony Barrett
Last updated at 3:09PM, June 24 2015

It says everything about the widespread lack of faith in Liverpool’s transfer committee and the now endemic rush to judgment on social media that the Merseyside club’s acquisition of Roberto Firmino for £29 million is already being dismissed in some quarters as an undue extravagance. Not only do Liverpool have form in paying over the odds for players, but the Brazilian is an unknown quantity in this country and as such the fee cannot be anything other than excessive.

In fairness, Liverpool can have few complaints about the scrutiny after lavishing £25 million on Adam Lallana, £20 million on Dejan Lovren, £20 million on Lazar Markovic, £16 million on Mario Balotelli and £15 million on Joe Allen, to name but five, since Brendan Rodgers took over as manager three years ago. The “bang for their buck” that Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owner, had sought from transfers has, with few exceptions, proved elusive.

So, it is in many ways both inevitable and understandable that the decision to make Firmino the second-most expensive player in the club’s history behind Andy Carroll is greeted with suspicion. When you have a reputation for buying badly, you cannot complain if the idea that you might have bought well does not immediately take hold.

That Firmino is something of an unknown quantity might add mystique to the deal, but beyond the exotic and the YouTube videos that make most players look good, a lack of knowledge leads many to ask how Liverpool could have paid £29 million for a player they do not even know.

All of that, though, remains moot. Beyond the sizeable minority of Bundesliga addicts who have tuned in to watch Hoffenheim games and kept abreast of Firmino’s progress in Germany, it is impossible for the rest of us to pass any kind of judgment on the 23-year-old. All we can do is wait and see. If the Brazilian performs well for Liverpool, offers some of the qualities they have been lacking and improves the team as a result, then £29 million will be money well spent. If not, his name will be added to their list of failures and, more than likely, heads will roll.

The point is, it is far too early to make any kind of call on Firmino. Like any new signing, whether recruited at a vast cost or for a relative pittance, he has to be given the time to prove himself. What can be evaluated, however, is what his acquisition and the scale of it says about Liverpool’s transfer strategy in the light of recent failings in both their attempts to attract world-class talent and their ability to extract value for money from the market.

The first thing that should be stressed is, in contrast to many of their dealings in the past few years, Liverpool have displayed both an absolute ruthlessness and a determination to get a deal over the line while others, most notably Manchester City and Manchester United, were still weighing up their options. No time has been wasted, no expense has been spared. The asking price has been met, negotiations have not been allowed to drag on and, perhaps most importantly of all, Liverpool have backed themselves whereas previously they may have wavered or attempted to extract value that was not available.

Players bought since Rodgers’s appointment (season by season)

2015-16 Roberto Firmino (£29 million, Hoffenheim), Joe Gomez (£3.5 million, Charlton Athletic), Adam Bogdan (free agent), Danny Ings (tribunal to set fee, Burnley), James Milner (free agent)

2014-15 Mario Balotelli (£16 million, AC Milan), Javier Manquillo (on loan, Atletico Madrid), Alberto Moreno (£12 million, Seville), Divock Origi (£10 million, Lille), Dejan Lovren (£20 million, Southampton), Lazar Markovic (£20 million, Benfica), Emre Can (£9.75 million, Bayer Leverkusen), Adam Lallana (£25 million, Southampton), Rickie Lambert (£4 million, Southampton)

2013-14 Victor Moses (on loan, Chelsea), Tiago Ilori (£7 million, Sporting Lisbon), Mamadou Sakho (£15 million, Paris Saint-Germain), Aly Cissokho (on loan, Valencia), Kolo Touré (free agent), Simon Mignolet (£9 million, Sunderland), Iago Aspas (£7.6 million, Celta Vigo), Luis Alberto (£6.8 million, Seville)

2012-13 Philippe Coutinho (£8.5 million, Inter Milan), Daniel Sturridge (£12 million, Chelsea), Samed Yesil (£1 million, Bayer Leverkusen), Nuri Sahin (on loan, Real Madrid), Oussama Assaidi (£3 million, Heerenveen), Joe Allen (£15 million, Swansea City), Fabio Borini (£10.5 million, Roma)

Total spent £244.65 million (Ings’s tribunal, loan fees and money received from sales not included)

They could have attempted to drive down the price or to convince Firmino that he should accept a lower wage, but to do so would have invited competition. Even the complications of third-party ownership did not prove a significant impediment, although they did mean the deal could not be completed until after some had claimed it had already been signed off. Otherwise, Liverpool were decisive, illustrated by the decision of Ian Ayre, the club’s chief executive, to fly to Chile to meet the player’s representatives before he could be sure that there was a deal to be done.

That sense of purpose has been evident in everything that Liverpool have done this summer, as illustrated by Firmino being the fifth deal they have put in place before the transfer window has opened. Danny Ings, James Milner, Joe Gomez and Adam Bogdan have been recruited and that early business has given the club’s much-maligned transfer committee a solid platform as they look to add the attacking flair that Rodgers readily accepts was lacking last season following Luis Suarez’s move to Barcelona.

Again, it remains to be seen how well that quartet will adapt to their new surroundings but the significance that can be drawn lies in the fact that Liverpool have managed to snare their targets. Milner was coveted by Arsenal, Gomez had a host of admirers, Tottenham Hotspur informed Burnley they were willing to pay £12 milllion for Ings and, well, Bolton Wanderers would have preferred not to lose Bogdan on a free transfer. In each case, Liverpool showed the same decisiveness that allowed them to sign Firmino; their interest being established early with agents and followed up rigorously until the point at which signings that could have been missed out on moved inexorably in their direction.

What is most significant of all, though, is that this kind of activity comes in the aftermath of a period in which the future of several leading figures at Anfield, none more so than the manager himself, was brought into question after a profoundly disappointing campaign. While Rodgers had to come through an end-of-season review and the previous work of the transfer committee was brought into sharp focus, FSG has responded to such uncertainty with an emphatic statement of intent by giving them the tools to move with remarkable speed in the transfer market.

These are not the actions of a club who have lost faith in themselves, even if others continue to doubt them. Should their faith in Firmino be repaid it may also be the signal for a reassessment of Liverpool’s aptitude in the transfer market. Again, though, only time will tell on that front.

null,false,lancashire_lad,null,null,null,"&gt; Well telling someone they can't live with the person they married is a terrible idea, what kind of society does that make us. If we are allowing them to get married then by law they have the same rights as any other married couple, I don't see why we should discriminate against them because they have a different cultural norm when it comes to marriage.

If they are insistent on arranging a marriage with someone from their country of ethnic origin, then they obviously prefer that nation's cultural traditions and can go and live there. Of course the law in the UK should be based around British culture rather than tribal Pakistani culture. Would you allow a British man of Saudi origins to bring in four wives because that's his ""cultural norm""? 

&gt; As for limiting low skilled immigration even more, I'm not convinced as there are some vital low skilled jobs which are needed to create/keep the high skilled jobs. If you limit them you may end up losing high skilled jobs too.

Could you please give a few examples?

&gt; Many of the services industries are highly mobile and if you make them have to pay much more for cleaners/secretaries/etc.. . They can easily move to other countries which are cheaper and their employees will be happy to do the same as the cost of living in the UK will skyrocket. A IT companies, banks, Ad agencies, designers, movie and music producers, these are all industries that can be easily moved and are some of the many highly skilled jobs that we as a country do well.

You are advocating an economic development plan where we keep wages low so that companies will stay here. This is a royal fuck you to the working class. I also don't even agree it makes economic sense. I don't believe the cleaning and secretary costs are more than a couple of percent of the revenues of any decent-sized company. Even a 10% increase in salary for these people would thus be 0.2% of revenues or less. 

Why aren't you just honest here? You have an ideological commitment to increase immigration to the UK, so will dismiss any problem that it causes, even if it needs ludicrous economic claims you have no evidence for.

Half of us rode mountain bikes (they usually got stolen after a few months, Maltese Paul who had the bike shop on Bell St made a good living selling us replacements, we couldn't ride robbed bikes because we got stopped and reported about once a week and some cops checked serial numbers)

I actually carded at the time they are talking about ( Around 1994 I believe' maybe a little later), we called it a Blitz, we knew they couldn't keep it up indefinitely due to cost of their operation, we got paid more cash to replace the cards so we really didn't mind.

The trick was working for as many flats as you could. The most I ever made was £240 a day ( you got paid £10 per hundred, 2 for every flat in the box on that magic eye level). From 4 in the morning till 6 in the evening,I got burned out fast. £1,200 a week was a lot of money in those days, a airline pilot made around £50,000. The cops - PC's around £30,000. Some of the cops hated us from a moral perspective, some just told us to fuck off, till they'd gone so to speak.

A card man took a case to the House of Lords and got the law changed. Phone boxes BT a private company was private property so the original charge of littering in the public place was eventually quashed. They had to change the law to illegal advertising to control the problem. When they changed the law I had at least £5,000 worth of fines quashed. That was just me never mind the other 50 guys from Marble Arch to Liverpool St

From http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_341133.pdf I think it's figure 2 that gives the most pertinent statistic which is that ""By 2011/12, the income
of retired households had grown 2.7 times to £19,300, while the income of non-retired households doubled from its 1977 level to £25,700."". That is the ""median equivalised disposable income"" if I'm interpreting it correctly; the disposable part meaning after tax (?).

So based on 2012 figures 60% of £25k would be ~£14k. 

The equivalisation for a family of 4 is 1.4 so a family of 4 would earn up to £19k and be below 60% of the equivalised median income.

FWIW my family falls in to that category and we don't even qualify for free school meals. More than half of that goes on house+car (car needed for work).

Have you spoken to your insurance company at all about it?  Many insurance companies will not charge you the excess unless you actually have the car repaired through insurance, and will be happy to request the police report on your behalf.  For most decent insurance companies there will only be a claim on your policy if your insurance company ends up with unrecovered costs at the end of the claim, and generally speaking your insurance should be able to recover costs either from the at fault insurer or the motor insurers bureau if the driver is uninsured.  You may have an uninsured driver's agreement in your policy booklet which explains what happens if there's no insurance, eithe rspeak with your insurers claims department or consult your policy documents.

Though your excess may be £500, you might be able to agree with your insurance to hold off on having the repairs done so you don't have to pay your excess right away, or, if your reason for not wanting to go to your insurance is that you expect the repairs to be less than £500, your insurance should not charge you £500 for repairs of, say, £400.",null,0,null,1435246323,null,0,false,0,csib9ey,null,t3_3b222n,null,t1_csib9ey,null,t3_3b222n,null,null,null,1437340571,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

null,false,lancashire_lad,null,null,null,"&gt; I have no problem with a Saudi man marrying 4 women if they are all consenting adults. Obviously it is currently against the law, but I don't see why it matters as long as all the people involved are happy with the arrangement.

I think it matters because monogamy has had a far better record of providing social stability, child well-being and equality of sexes than polygamy has. I don't see why we should bring in more people from the country to protect foreign cultural practices. 

&gt; By the way arranged marriages aren't just some tribal Pakistani culture they have existed all over the world for millenia. In fact many Jews still get arranged marriages.

And many Jews refuse to shake hands with women and insist on a barbaric approach to killing animals. We don't need to cater to such things.

&gt; Some multinational companies have already been threatening and have moved over a few percentage in corporation tax and you think they won't move if they have to pay significantly higher wages? They won't just have to pay higher wages to the low skilled workers but to all their workers as it becomes more expensive to live in the UK.

Of course multinational companies complain all the time. They will do everything in their power to pretend they will leave unless the government starts improving their profit margins. That doesn't mean we should fall for it. 

And once again, what you are advocating for is to keep businesses here by having low wage costs. I take it you think raising the minimum wage is also bad for business? Or are low wages only important when it comes to being an argument for letting more immigrants in?

&gt; I do think immigration is good for the country but I'm not the one suggesting approaches which go against things that every respected economist says. They all advocate that generally having more immigration is good for the economy. It seems much more like you are the one with an idealogical commitment that is anti-immigration and weirdly obsessed with arranged marriages.

I'm not anti-immigration. I just think we need to limit immigration to those who provide a benefit that outweighs the very real costs of immigration. That means the high skilled. Low skilled labour is a net negative. Most economists would accept that. 

I'm also not weirdly obsessed with arranged marriages. I mentioned it as one group of low skilled immigrants and you interrogated me over it. I then responded to each argument you raised.

As for low skilled immigration, I think there will always be a need for some.

The important part is more to find a consistent way of beating teams IMO, not just relying on individual performances and world class strikes a la Coutinho.

If Rodgers can do that, then I think he can truly be considered the man for the job.

&gt;The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday 14 October 2010

&gt;A headline and the first paragraph of a story that examined the numbers of people of African-Caribbean and African descent in the prison system in the UK and the US wrongly stated, owing to an editing error, that black people in England and Wales were more at risk of jail than black Americans. The rest of the story, based on a new report, accurately reported that the proportion of black people in jail in the UK was almost seven times their share of the population, whereas in the US the proportion of black prisoners is four times greater than their population share. The expression of the figures was extrapolated from the Equality and Human Rights Commission report How Fair is Britain? The report drew on a 2008 Ministry of Justice document, footnoted as the source of the EHRC statement that stated: ""Black prisoners make up 15% of the prisoner population and this compares with 2.2% of the general population – there is greater disproportionality in the number of black people in prisons in the UK than there is in the United States."" According to a range of sources, including the US justice department, about 12% of the US population is black and about 40% to 45% of the US prison population is black. According to Roy Walmsley's World Prison Population List 2009, the US jails 756 of every 100,000 of its population. The corresponding figure for England and Wales is 153. Based on the figures above, America jails 3% of its black population, and England and Wales 1%. This means that a black person in the US is three times as likely to be imprisoned as in England and Wales.

TL:/DR 
The figures were incorrectly extrapolated,  a black person in the US is three times as likely to be imprisoned as in England and Wales.

My best guess would be no, given his circumstances but it depends what his will was like. 

Having said that, rights to property and estates (whatever that constitutes for a 16 year old) tend to go from spouse to children to parents to siblings and then further removed family as far as I know in the absence of a will but I am by no means an expert. As the two were legal spouses then it would in theory be her that inherits his estate, given an assumed lack of any children in which items could be left to in a will. Power of attorney could be granted to his parents but a piece of paper doesn't dictate next of kin, only who is calling the shots once you pop. I doubt we'll ever truly know the answer but it's quite complex. As a short answer, his next of kin is his legal wife. Under normal circumstances she'd inherit his estate.

When we get right down to it, it is just the name of the organisation that left the wreath, which I think is allowable by convention; it doesn't have a message on it like ""UKIP supports our troops"" or something, to which I would probably object.

Here's my line of thought: If I put a wreath with ""from /u/convertedtoradians"" on it, I think that would be acceptable. If my company placed one and put ""From all at Oswold's Rectangle Emporium"", I don't think there would be a problem either. It's only a short leap to the case where they had hand-written ""from everyone at the Townville UKIP office"", which would also be okay. This isn't sufficiently different for me to object on any reasonable grounds, I think. Not that I'm sure; but that's my first reaction.

I'm pretty sure I've seen wreathes with logos of other political parties, charitable organisations and other concerns on, and I've never thought ""Gosh! Seeing that in some ways changes my opinion about this organisation for better or worse"". I just tend to, you know, nod in recognition that they've placed a wreath.

I would be surprised if anyone decided to either start or stop voting for UKIP based on this.

The lack of education around drugs is definitely a big issue. The 'legal high' market is shocking, people assume that because it's not illegal then it must be safe. Very few people stop to think that actually it's such a new chemical that it's evading the laws and we have zero idea what damage/benefit it has.

Regulate, tax and control the substances and educate the public as to the true effects, let's get rid of the BS and myths surrounding the whole scene. There are too many arguments in favour of doing so but just one stubborn mindset of all pyschoactive substances=Drugs=Illegal=Bad  

Apart from anything else they need to take the funds out of the hands of paramilitaries and criminals.  The profits of the recreational drug market should could be contributing to society rather than keeping dodgy people in power.

I'm a bit confused as to why the SNP really want to be in NATO, if I'm honest. They've got some oil, yes, but other than that there doesn't seem to be much that any country would really want to attack Scotland over. There are quite a few countries in Europe which aren't in NATO anyway.

Why I say overrated I mean their current ability. Baker isn't good enough for the premier league currently. Same with chalobah.

I'm of the opinion we don't handle our youths well enough so it's not a coping mechanism for me. Too many loans and not enough stability. It's not working  for most honestly.

Because you've already decided that and it's not to be contested, right? Despite his not, er, saying anything racist. So now there is no get-out 'otherwise' for you - you're giving a perfect example of a primary reason this sort of thing isn't discussed; tabloidy indeed.

Or insulting arrogance on your part to assume as much. Quote where in the past four or five hours he's said something incontrovertibly racist. Anywhere. Take your time.

The old class structure which I believe exists today is as follows

Upper class- landed gentry, first born aristocracy, land lords and those of independent wealth.they do not work, generally by hand or by head.

Middle class- those born of the upper classes but not first born, generally they were packed off to private school and ended up as the officers in all branches of the military, clergy, politicians, judiciary. Exceptional merchants and business owners may end up in this category too. 

Working class- everybody else without these connections, infrastructure or inheritance that sells their labour by head or by hand. 






Edit. I would add that it could be argued that david Cameron is Middle class, at the upper end though.  He has no family titles or estate, was the son of a banker, has an inheritance too small to live from indefinitely, most of his wealth is tied up property bought with mortgages from his salary as PR man for ITV/ Carlton.

&gt; ...the loan system is an anomaly in these days of financial fair play, because the two concepts are idealistically incompatible.

Can someone make me understand this a little better?

&gt; So a club that buys outright, that offers permanence and meets the bill in full, risks being kicked out of Europe. One that creates a temporary structure, that shares the costs, that runs a shop with its rivals’ stock, gets the green light.

This seems like a complaint levied only because other teams are mad that Everton, by using the inherent nuances of a system to their advantage rather than choosing to be burdened by them, is doing something wrong. This is a crock.

Raheem was first offered a contract in the aftermath of our near title winning, CL qualifying, summer of huge signings year. We showed intent. He rejected a contract that might have been a bit low, but was certainly not out of place for someone of his age. He waited to get that European Boy trophy, his agent generated headlines about interest from clubs like Madrid, Bayern, and then the obvious English ones.

He has been playing this for money THE WHOLE TIME. It's the same playbook used by Berahino. 

There was a point where it was reasonably about the money. As in, ""Yes, we understand you played very well last year and there would be a number of suitors for your talents, so it makes sense that you'd hold out for more"". 

All of our players and their agents will use plenty of bargaining chips they have. What you don't see is agent's leaking information and holding the club for ransom. That's what Ward does. And he does that because he left his other firm, ala Jerry Maguire, and is acting like an idiot.

Raheem is about nothing but the money. Unlike Suarez, he has no reason to believe he can be a key contributor to a top-10 in the world side. He'll be a rotation man at best. Unlike Suarez, he also experienced a massive nosedive in form the minute it became clear his contract wasn't being sorted.

&gt;A large amount of white supremacist material was found when police searched his house. He was also obsessed with the ""no compromise"" tactics of the group called Islamic State and Jihadi John, who has appeared in its films decapitating western hostages.

&gt;He told police: ""It was irrelevant what religion he was. It was his appearance just the way he looked. It did not matter to me what religion he was, it was his racial appearance.""

&gt;Zack Davies was not well known to far-right monitoring groups, though National Action and the violent activists they associate with regularly wear masks on protests to hide their identities. He had built up relationships online with members of the group, sharing childish and offensive far-right images.

Doesn't sound like it was a sudden moment of madness and he had no interest in far right groups. He even posed with a knife in front of a far right flag before the attack and he had contact with some members of a group. 

Still mental health issues in sense anyone who does this with that level of hate is crazy. But in other cases isn't posing in front of extremist flags, having extremist material, some online activity been enough even for lone attackers to be seen as act of terror.

You may as well try to speak to the landlord directly though. There's no harm in it.

State that since you've already (presumably) paid your first and last month's rent that you'll be moving out in two months unless the situation can be resolved. 

It's important to speak to the landlord and not the agency though. The landlord most likely won't want to go through the rigmarole and additional expense of finding another tenant so soon, so you may get lucky. The agency on the other hand will be thrilled at the prospect of collecting a second set of fees from the landlord and the next tenant.

...again, be sure speak to the landlord not the agent. I can't stress that enough.

Offer to allow the landlord to meet the cat before making a final decision, and offer to pay a reasonable pet deposit (offer to pay it along with the rent in a months time if you can't afford it straight away). Also be sure to reassure the landlord that while your cat is extremely well behaved, should there be any damage to any of the carpets, furniture, fixtures or fittings that you're fully willing to cover the cost of any repairs/replacements.

The deterrance thing works because you are never quite sure what the other side will do - who can predict who will be PM in 50 years? So people become super-cautious when nukes are around. Look at India and Pakistan and how the number of skirmishes has dropped...

As for ""antagonistic neighbours"" - we are being bombarded by Russian planes at the moment coming in from the north (across the arctic), they are closer to us than the Americans are. At the moment it's just harassment - they want to make RAF planes scramble over and over - and perhaps map our response. If there was no nukes in Britain and France and no American presence in Germany and Eastern Europe, our safe world wouldn't be so safe.

SNP's sudden conversion to NATO is because of those Russian planes in Scottish airspace which has made them suddenly rethink their position. If they were a NATO member, *England* would be obliged to come to the defence of an independent Scotland.

I agree. Can we really compare self-service checkouts to wide scale automation? I personally find comparing that to let's say robotic car production lines a bit misleading.

Yes there is no doubt that self-service checkouts do reduce the need for staff but the technology isn't all that different. Rather than the machine replacing the cashier, the customer has replaced the cashier. The only real different is that the machine counts the money rather than the cashier, all the other differences are there for security/anti-theft needs (e.g. the scales in the bagging area.).

Of his contract he said, ""Why should I throw fifteen million Euro away when it is already mine? At the moment I signed it was in fact my money, my contract.""

You know, I'll admit it, there's a thin strain of logic in suggesting we need austerity, and need to have some 'hard times' so things will get better for everyone. It's an argument I disagree with, but it's an argument that has some logic to it all the same. 

However, when this government have shown that those 'hard times' aren't for everyone, how it is the very poorest who are made to suffer more while the very richest have burdens removed from them, I begin to really question their commitment to ended the recession as quickly as possible, and their commitment to this 'a rising tide lifts all boats' ideology. 

When independent charities are saying it is the actions of this government that is leading to more poverty, then yeah, you can criticise those charities for having an agenda to attack the government. However, I think the much more reasonable and logical answer is that these charities are committed to ending poverty, and that they will criticise any party, whoever they are, if their actions contradict that.

My sister had bipolar and committed suicide because of it. She experienced all of those things you described.

Do you know what caused her to feel worse throughout the day, and actually feel those symptoms you're describing?

Being stuck at home doing nothing with herself. 

Once she got a job, and it caused a lot of fights and arguments but we got there in the end, she ended up much happier, got into a happy relationship and stopped the self harming. She knew she couldn't get up in the mornings (she blamed her medication, fair enough) and hated going to bed early,  so moved on to bar work. The reason why she committed suicide was because she had a massive fight with a best friend who pretty much told her to go kill herself.

Yeah, Sherlock is one of the ""too many to count"" ones :). Inbetweeners was great, as was Misfits (but it went downhill for sure).

If you like 30 minute comedies then **Bad Education** was awesome (it's done, so probably on youtube or whatever), **Inside No. 9** is one of my favs but kind of....weird. Dark comedy, but you gotta give it a few episodes since each episode is a new story/setting.

I started BBUK during the last C4 series (Josie won) and have watched all the C5 ones (including Celebrity series'), don't know what it is that makes that show so addictive.

Rylan is awesome, first saw him on **X-Factor** (another ""bad"" reality show I watch every year. I only watch the UK version, and it's the only show like that I've ever watched). Never got into Britains Got Talent. You could also check out **""I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!""**, you might like that.

Do you like panel shows like **QI**? There's also an /r/panelshow if you're into that. I like **Mock the Week**, **8 out of 10 Cats**, etc....

There was also a really good medical drama that just finished called **Critical**.

Going into list mode to just mention some other good stuff I have watched (some on-going, some done) that you might not have heard about:

* Broadchurch
* Banana
* Cucumber
* Episodes (UK/US co-production)
* The Fall
* Humans (brand new but really good so far)
* Uncle

What I was concerned about, after reading the article, was that all discussions of the subject would be shut down in all schools due to the fear of losing funding if the ""c"" word is even mentioned. Having hear so many zero-tolerance horror stories in the US school system, that is one thing I would argue we never adopt in the UK. Teachers need to be able to get the message across using the skills and methods they have developed, and not be told by tick-box prescription exactly what they may or may not say. That way we lose our best educators and gain people interested only in career progression through gaining points handed out to them for following the steps they have been given.

To me, education is not just about scientific facts, it also covers understanding how other people think and what their belief systems are based on. If those beliefs are based on faith, then that is clearly stated. If those beliefs are based on junk science, then that should be quickly debunked and explained.",null,0,null,1435254147,null,0,1435254460,0,csighnq,null,t3_3b2rou,null,t1_csighnq,null,t1_csig1hr,null,null,null,1437344178,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

It's important because the party that is seen to address immigration effectively has the potential to win those votes - and 3 million would have been enough to turn Milibands defeat into a resounding victory to rival blairs 1997 performance, so its no small issue. The problem I notice is that for users that aren't familiar with Englands immigration issues (especially suburban and coastal towns) it can all seem a bit bizarre that people pay this ""UKIP"" crowd any attention... but its a big deal to those it effects and some people take them a lot more seriously than this reddit would have us believe.

Many of those *could* be excellent signings, but with Sturridge's fitness as it is and with 2 strikers who we can't really be confident of scoring that many goals, there's no place to take that chance at the moment. That's why I think we'll get Bacca, he's the most reliable option and considering how much we need a striker and the lack of proven options available, I think the necessity will overrule his age. 

I'm personally a fan of Volland and Paco Alcacer and they both fit the profile of what we're normally looking for (though the latter might be hard to prise away from Valencia) but after the problems of last season it just makes sense to pick up someone at his peak. With Bacca's release clause, I think it'll be done.

As you say, most people adapt to their environment. Put nearly anyone into a sinkhole estate, especially from an early age, and the results will be predictable. 

But there's more to this than a culture of dependency. Automation and globalisation has wiped out the unskilled work which people would have been able to do a generation ago. A lot of people just aren't cut out for work in modern Britain, and no-one would employ  them. Decreasing their benefits isn't going to magically enable them to find work.

One solution is housing. The government could allow housing associations to build more houses, and sell some of them to cover the costs. This would create small scale pleasant mixed-tenure estates instead of large dysfunctional sinkholes. And it would save the taxpayer a fortune in housing benefit payments. Nearly everyone wins!

Anthony Martial is likely to become a very good player but he's one of those who can't lead a strike-force on his own.

Rolan has good numbers but hasn't stood out as that good a player when I've seen him. 

Michy looks very good but has been a sub for Marseille, could be as good as Bony or Sturridge when given the chance in a good team or could struggle as a regular.

The whole point of a degree in software engineering is that they'll teach you the basics and allow you to build on the basics. They specifically design the courses to allow for students who have less or no computing knowledge. 

It's very common to get overwhelmed on a computing course. I think it had a fairly high drop-out rate when I was there. It's normal to be overwhelmed and it's normal to have difficulties along the way. Plenty of times I thought I wasn't cut out for it but I endured through it and came out successful in the end.

We flopped dismally in Europe even against utter minnows.  Remember back to when you were 20, 5 years is a stupidly long time, a quarter of your life. 6 months seems an eternity.

The fact is, he joined us to become the ""Highest paid teenager in the country"", he was a money motivated 15 year old, his mum is money motivated, his professional team is money motivated, of course that mentality rubs off. 

None of this excuses the fact he comes off as an ungrateful, jumped up little gobshite that looked amazing in the reflected glory of Suarez and Sturridge but has failed to live up to his own hype when the spotlight has been shone on him directly. If he wanted to win things then it's on him to make sure that he's a winner. Whether he blames the manager for not picking the right team, the club for not signing the right players or the team mates for not doing enough, he needed to be a £50 million pound player and win us games by putting the ball in the back of the net when served up to him on a plate, or by putting it on a plate for others, not sulking,  getting overwhelmed by pressure, or being too tired and having holidays in Jamaica or partying on laughing gas. He's not a good professional in any sense. Maybe a season living with James Miller would give him some insight into what's required to be a winner rather than his current entourage that lives in his party pad with him, too afraid to go out in town in case he meets fans that want to show how much they adore him by having their selfie taken with him.

Note that I said house.  I'm sick of flats; almost everyone I know lives in one, visiting a proper house is a real treat.  I would like a modest garden and some proper storage space, as I'll be 33-34 by then that's not too much to ask.

No, it isn't. You might want to read up on your own country's law, since you don't have to be moving in to kick a tennant out. 

Those aren't even the only two conditions on which you can kick a tennant out, they're just *examples*. That means if you decide you no longer want to be a landlord because you aren't making money, you can evict. If you want to renovate the place, you can evict. If you want to bulldoze it for your own private swimming pool, you can evict. 

If you want a good reason to not be kicked out of a house, I would suggest that you buy that house instead of relying on someone else to buy it for you.

I think that was instituted to discourage people from trying to stop the players/staff as they leave - the entrance is onto a reasonably busy road, so having people weaving in/around the traffic is probably not a good thing.

It's a bit of a shame, and nothing like the ""old days"" at Harlington, where you could literally walk into the place and watch them train - as I did many times.

last year, we scored half of what we scored the season before, thus resulting inthe downturn. bar the last stoke and cp game (where we were so obviously psycologically defeated as a team) we had only shipped 39 goals, only 12 since christmas by that point. and we can talk about ""well they happened"" but honestly both of those results were freak results. 

now, while i agree more of a focus on the defense needs to be placed, we have lucas who can play 20 some odd matches a season and a burgeoning can, as well as allen in certain games. that is plenty for right now when our biggest pressing issue is a striker and a lb to compete with moreno. moreno to me is very solid, and more so than that, has the potential to be great. he is 22, settled well now and saw a very promising upturn in form towards the end of the season. here's the deal, you're right, he was prone to defensive errors. but again, a lot of that was systemic. think about the formations we played during our abysmal period and how exposed he was. i think there was a lack of leadership in our side keeping a young guy like him disciplined and hopefully this year, lovren, skrtel, milner, hendo, etc really keep after him. 

but your points are extremely valid so to some degree, i can say that you are right. in others, it would be foolish to spend another 15m on a lb when we have just spent 12 + add ons for moreno. it would be wiser to try and get an older head for cheap who can offer some wisdom and help moreno grow. lovren is due for a very good season. i think he struggled to settle, but i fully believe he will establish himself as a starter alongside sahko by the end of 2016. 

who knows though, the beauty of this summer right now, is we have gotten so much business done, so early. if we get a striker in by next week we literally have all summer to chase after a lb and possible dm/cm (kovacic would be a very intriguing signing in my mind...best midfield in the world much with all of the talent?) but my focus now is striker, first and foremost and a back up lb. otherwise, after that, we should focus on outbounds as they probably will start flowing out after july 1. i assume balo and borini are going to italy, enrique, coates and manq might all leave after july 1.

null,false,IndirectLemon,null,null,null,"Housing adviser here, that's a pretty big breach of tenancy.  
   
Considering the questions /u/TheAntiqueTraveller asked, it's pretty clear you have exclusive possession and what the landlord has done is essentially trespassing, breach of tenancy and honestly, it's just rude.  
  
It puts your deposit at risk as now the landlord could say; Start of your tenancy there was no smoke damage, end of your tenancy there is smoke damage. You were responsible for the property and as such, you're responsible for the smoke damage.  
  
There's very little you can do if the landlord breaches the tenancy, it does mean you could write to the landlord and give early notice in order to move elsewhere. However giving up a property without the landlord serving you a notice (Section 21, two months, plus he'd still need to go to court to get a possession order and bailiff's warrant before he can actually evict) could render you intentionally homeless (council won't help you if you can't find anywhere else). Unless one of your joint tenants surrenders the tenancy on the lot of you, that's not your fault.  
  
You can go into your local council, depending on where you are they might have a Private Sector Tenants team (a lot of councils are doing this now) who can often give you solid advice for alternative places to rent and how to deal with a landlord in regards to a breach, even if it's just building a record of harassment/trespassing to make it easier to get your deposit back at the end of it.
  
Oh, make sure your deposit is in a tenancy deposit scheme, any landlord willing to short term let a room whilst you're away is dodgy enough to not properly protect your deposit, and if he doesn't do that he can end up paying you back up to 3 times the deposit in damages for example.",null,0,null,1435257792,null,0,false,0,csiizgs,null,t3_3azvwc,null,t1_csiizgs,null,t3_3azvwc,null,null,null,1437345965,null,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

Did you know that it was Attlee that gave us our nuclear weapon? And that he put up prescription charges to pay to help defend Greece?

The true test of a left-winger is that they would **never** sacrifice a poor person's need for relief to pander to the middle classes. But that's exactly what the SNP has done. Ruined the lives of Scottish school kids who can't get the quals to go to university to pay for the university of all those public school kids in Edinburgh (I understand that a massive 25% of Edinburgh school kids have private education - do they sound like people who need a subsidy at the public purse at the expense of a poor kid getting their grades?) Rationing college places by cutting them so massively only helps those public school kids who get special teaching and nab all the places.

Freezing council tax is something else a left-winger wouldn't do. Councils have a duty to house the most vulnerable - battered women, people made suddenly homeless etc. They can't do that if you freeze council tax for seven years to pander to wealthy home-owners!

Basically the SNP simply don't care - they've hurt Scotland and then pretend it's all Westminsters fault. Anyone can call themselves socialist and they will if it persuades people to vote blindly for them - but you really ought to judge by how they treat the most vulnerable in society - and they are doing worse there than the Conservatives are.

How much do you earn between you?  Assuming you're both on £30k a year, that gives you roughly £47k between you after tax.  30% of this each month would put your rent at £1175 between you which doesn't seem too bad.  You should have plenty of room to save for a deposit, although it might take a little longer.

&gt; Theoretically we wouldn't need to be near the centre, but I can't predict if I'll be working in central in 4 years, but there's a good chance I will, so I need to stay close by.

Secondly, students are not going to need pensions, and they tend not to have children who go to school. They sometimes work jobs, but they are paying National Insurance into a benefits system that they will never claim from.

Branch off the M4 motorway just North of Bristol on the English side of the border for the M48 (you're going to get dicked for £7 at either bridge getting in to Wales) and have a look around Chepstow. A small but pretty former Roman port town, Chepstow Castle ruins are worth a nose around. Pick up a Manic Street Preachers or Stereophonics CD to add to the experience.

At this point if you have half a day free, you can venture north along the A469 to Monmouth along the beautiful Wye valley, visiting Tintern Abbey a few miles north of Chepstow. Monmouth itself is a very affluent town just a few miles inside the Welsh border, and just up the A40 to the west is Raglan with its' castle, before arriving in Abergavenny twelve miles later, a pretty market town with a castle ruin. Up the other side of the Blorenge mountain is Blaenavon with Big Pit - a museum paying homage to the massive mining industry of the last 150 years. Hammer back down the A4042 to rejoin the M4.

Whether you took the diversion North or not, pop across to Caerleon just north of Newport to visit the Roman ampitheatre and take in the semi-rural affluence, then jump back on to the M4, through the Brynglas Tunnels to the outskirts of our fine capital.

Kelly would have been fantastic had he stayed in his natural CB position, and I think Jones and Smalling would have progressed better had they not been used as utility players. I cringe when I see Stones played at RB for England.

Thats not true. I registered on the gov.uk site under the new system and you just need a national insurance number. See https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote.

It might be different depending if you are in NI or something, but thats how was for me in england.

I completely agree that generalisation is very counter productive , I think that's what's gotten us this far. The immigration figures are pretty stupid, almost half of the numbers are attributed to students which are people who pay a ridiculous amount of money to study here  (9k a year is nothing in comparison). A big chunk of the rest is people entering on work visas. 

The problem is that's not the immigrants that get portrayed , we just see the gypsies and the lazy assholes trying to find an easy way to do nothing. 

And because it's all the same to the goverment they cut what they can , namely people entering the country legally, they want to cut how long students can stay after their degree ends and they are capping skilled worker input. None of this deals with the benefit scam problem but the immigration figures go down so everyone is happy.

They have always made it known that this is a business strategy of theirs to get a bigger profit in the future. I think they have adapted well in the sense that they now see how important it is to bring in established and seasoned players. FSG is still sticking to it's model buy not paying 50m for a single player while bringing in players with potential who are not 19, but 23 or 24.

The current system provides prescriptions free to the vulnerable. The SNP are providing them to people who can afford them *and cutting benefits for the vulnerable to pay for it*. They sure haven't raised tax to make up the money, even though they've had tax raising powers for 15 years.

&gt;Why do you think the poor vote snp?

Because they got tricked? The defining piece of chicanery during the referendum was Salmond saying ""“Even with a cautious estimate of prices remaining at $113 a barrel being used, it’s clear that Scottish oil and gas could generate more revenues than has previously been assumed.”"" And then claimed he could get **three times more than the official estimate**.

That's why they voted for him - vulnerable desperate people being told they would be Rich, Rich! And the only people standing in their way was evil Labour and Westminster.

Here's the article on his oil announcement with his outlandish claims:

http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/salmond-scotland-s-oil-boom-to-bring-billions-1-2829902

He was predicting revenues of between £41bn and £57bn, despite the Norwegians warning (in that article) that they thought prices would fall below $100 a barrel.

The forecast is now for £2.1bn. see

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-33100374

That's a staggering **94% drop**

Either Alex Salmond is a complete idiot or he was engaged in outright trickery to con desperate people into voting for their own destitution. Because how do you make up that kind of shortfall in money in a country with just 5 million people. Deep savage cuts. He knew that - but persisted in the fibs. No real ""socialist"" would do that - but a nationalist would justify it as a price worth paying.

This whole argument illustrates why Labour would do well to just write off Scotland for a decade and not waste any more resources there. Because people like you who have voted for the SNP are still deeply invested in them. Here you are on a *Labour sub* wanting us to tell you that you did the right thing voting against Labour for those nationalists. And you are getting angry when we point out that you made a mistake and furious at candidates who point out home truths about the SNP.

You want us to say, yeah, it's socialist to freeze council tax and trick vulnerable people with implausible dreams of extreme riches in order to get them to vote in a manner that is not in their interets.

Well it's not socialist, and it's not right. But us telling you, this soon after the event, won't sink in, you need to find it out for yourself and that will take at least a decade before you acknowledge things to yourself.

[Here's](http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/8838/homemade-fifteens.aspx) a recipe that shows how easy it is, only 3 steps, about 15 minutes work tops plus a few hours in a fridge. But the best bit about making them yourself is you can leave out the desiccated coconut shops like to coat them in. Because fuck coconut.

Plus it's good stress relief to beat the ever living shit out of a bag of biscuits every once in a while and as it's a gift you might get ~~brownie~~ fifteen points for making it yourself, and will probably have extras leftover your friend doesn't need to know about.

Really the only thing to stop you is access to a fridge. ...And now I want to make fifteens.

I didn't do it myself because I'd only bought this bike for this season and didn't want to buy the shim kit and learn how to do it if I'm only going to do it once. I got messed around for months, the guy I took it to initially wouldn't give it back and wanted to charge me around a grand to fix it. Luckily, after some threatening (well, a LOT of threatening), I got the bike into a different place who did it for £200. Other than that it's needed a new gasket on one of the carbs, new filters, a new fuel hose and the valves done, so not too much and relatively pain-free (but I'd be lying if I said it was completely painless). Since I got it I've done three trips in excess of 150 miles and use it to commute on every day, I've put around 800 miles on it so far. So far so good, but I've only had it since Feb and like I said, it has been out of action until May so I've only really been riding it for a short time. But in that time! Holy moly in that time... I freaking LOVE this machine. As it's older, it's quite simple actually. I was quite surprised by how accessible everything is, and how straightforward it has been to learn the basic maintenance. Apparently the new monsters are more difficult to work on, but I've no experience with them.

I mean, I bought this thing because it turned up on Gumtree for a really good price (~£1.4k, 7,500 miles, recent service with belts, battery, tyres and some other important stuff) and I was a little bored of my YBR which I was using to commute. I didn't *need* a bigger bike, and as I say, I only have this one season to enjoy it so it was a reckless purchase, but I couldn't resist. And now I don't want to flip it. Ever. :(

A few universities (e.g. Oxbridge, Imperial) can make this up by research grants or endowments. All the rest rely on international students, who pay 50-200% more in tuition fees, in order to subsidise the Brits. However, the government sets a maximum quota of international students on undergraduate courses, so no British 18-year old has *ever* been denied a place because of an international student.

The result is [a divergence between postgraduate and undergraduate courses](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/overseas-students-the-impact-on-domestic-student-numbers/). More and more British students are taking postgraduate courses, partly because there are more and more international postgrads to subsidise them. Undergrad numbers have not risen in the same way, because of the quota. They are stuck at about the 50% (of 18-year olds) level that was set and achieved by the Blair government.


Regarding Christmas - yes, most Chinese students do stay in the UK. The Home Office runs a scheme (HOST) where you can invite one round to cheer them up and show some British hospitality. Why not give it a try?

Excellent. Now prove it. Amazon are generally not too bad with returns. But some retailers, for example Argos, require professional verification reports that the fault was inherent after the 6th month/warranty period has elapsed. Best course of action is to tell Amazon your rights, and ask them which way they'd prefer to handle it. Don't mention your own obligations.

The SNP lied and lied wickedly over the referendum - but that's ok, *because they're special*, right? They should be treated the same as Clegg - he did it on a much more minor point (and tuition fees is minor compared to the lie over the oil)

He's generally been pretty solid when playing for us, but then every manager (AVB, Sherwood, Poch) has eventually decided [he'd be better mowing the grass in the reserves.](http://tgsphoto.photoshelter.com/image/I0000NzP69QGe6dQ)  He must be absolutely atrocious in training, and was rumored to be a part of the ITK Kaboul Cabal.

And you're getting some. The projects that have been paused (eventually), HS2, northern hub, talk of HS3 between Manchester and Leeds.

&gt; and to be honest I couldn't give a toss about Cornish, Devon or Dorset rail network.

The same could be said for everyone in the south who constantly hears HS2 this and ""Northern Powerhouse"" that, even while their own rail lines are out of commission because they've fallen into the sea or have been flooded. Our fares and taxes will be used to help pay for northerners to get to London a bit quicker, though

&gt;  You already get cheaper fares,

Do we? My bank statements and used tickets might disagree there. Local tickets might be a bit cheaper than the national average, but longer distances certainly aren't.

&gt; someone bangs on about how well we have it up here 

That's because you actually do. Your main line(s) to London look 21st century compared to what we have, and the future up there is brighter than it is here. 

&gt; Every time a story about improving rail infrastructure between the country's third, fourth and fifth largest cities someone bangs on about how well we have it up here and how shit Cornish trains are. 

How dare they. It's not as if northerners don't do the exact same thing when London is talked about. 

&gt; It's a story detailing a South Western rail infrastructure upgrade is the Transport Secretary's ""top priority' and pointing this out is being pedantic?

Yes, because it's for the line that isn't the main line for most of the region. The line being upgraded doesn't handle most of the trains for Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. That line is totally separate (the junction is near Reading) and is not being electrified *except* to Newbury

It is pedantic for the reason that it doesn't benefit most of the region's population. It is like saying ""the north west is getting upgrades"" when in fact it's Manchester that is getting them.

&gt;  It may not directly bring benefits to these towns [citation needed]

Same reason. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_to_Taunton_Line is the main line for most of Somerset and all of Devon and Cornwall, with the exception of the odd service that does go via Bristol. It is not part of the electrification plans. 

&gt; Cornwall/Devon railways are shite, we get it, so are ours.

Nope. Ours is a whole different level (and with absolutely no sign of improvements), you can't even try to compare the two. I'm sure you'll keep trying though, because it is simply impossible that parts of the north are actually getting more attention than parts of the south.

I totally see your point about Bacca's age. But if you're wanting a genuine bonafied 20 a season goal-getter (and everyone on here seems to bang on about an impact signing rather than potential) £20million on Bacca would probably be a less risky move than nearer to £30million with Benteke.

I wouldn't say Benteke is a static player, but having watched him play a handful of times this season, he cannot maintain a pressing game for 90 minutes. He's not that type of player, and realistically that's the type of player we need. For me, Benteke &amp; Balotelli are both examples of a signing for the sake of a signing, I can't see Benteke being able to press defenses and make the right kind of runs for Coutinho &amp; Firmino. 

The reason Benteke destroyed us is because we had Gerrard as the holding midfielder. His runs went completely untracked and we were left exposed. Even Dwight Gayle can do that.

But honestly, all of that aside - the real negative for me - is that I cannot for the life of me deal with the nickname *'Bentekkers'* I can just about deal with Studge, Couts &amp; Hendo, but *Bentekkers* can fuck right off.

It doesn't matter about the rest of the upgrades that the north has had in recent years, is getting, or is about to get - pacers are literally the only thing that matter

Somerset/Devon/Cornwall have 80s' local trains too, they're very slightly better built but they aren't luxury. If I want to go to Plymouth, Exeter or even Bristol (one early morning service) I have to go on one of these. One branch line in Devon actually does use Pacers too. Our long distance trains are from the late 70s/early 80s, but they're actually quite nice

&gt; Maybe the government will get round to connecting up villages in Cornwall after a decent service has been implemented up here.

You have an interesting fixation on Cornwall when the problems with the south west are more regional in scope, like the Dawlish sea wall, that affects everyone in Cornwall and a good chunk of Devon (or conversely, the rest of the country when they all decide to come down here for holidays)

&gt; http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/pr8779199ca64fb1aea2b2d67fa2337f.aspx

That makes local fares cheaper, but without ticket splitting it doesn't affect long distance fares

You could argue that the lower fares are payback for the crap infrastructure. I'd gladly pay a few quid more per ticket if it meant actually getting investment.

&gt; that's 5 up north and 8 down south (not including London because that isn't totally fare)

Am I missing something? Two for the south east, two for the south west makes four. One of those in the south west is likely to be the GWML electrification, which has been discredited already. I'm not sure what the other SW project is. NW + NE + Yorkshire = 5. What were you saying? What about if HS2 happens and £50bn is spent on a line going northwards? That would surely tip the scales well into the north's favour

So Labour needs to *leave them alone* for ten years. We need to walk away and focus on England.

Have you seen the stuff that has come out of Scottish Labour? - they haven't been pulling their weight in years. The National Labour party has been cross-subsidizing them. A complete waste of precious resources that should have been deployed in the English marginals. 

Labour needs to pivot and focus on England. In the South-west (which the LibDems lost so spectacularly), Labour vote increased quite sharply, for the first time in ages. Not enough to replace the LibDems there yet, but stuff to work with, and what's more people there quite like the centrist/Blairist approach so Lab doesn't have to change too much to pick them up. 

I would pull funding from Scotland and pump it into the West Midlands and into the south-west to build a new beach-head.

If the Scots really want Labour, they will join and finance the Scottish Labour party themselves.

TL;dr - it's not even worth trying to get SNP voters back. They're not in a mood to listen so it's a wasted effort. Focusing on the 8% Scots at the expense of the 92% rUK will piss off England.

If it's a £1600 deposit that's quite a nice, big flat. It being furnished, too, would explain why the landlord is scared of problems.

Second up, the 'no pets' rule really is boilerplate. They aren't going to overturn it unless you convince them it's going to be fine. Give them a written request for permission, saying you want permission for you one, existing cat. Give some details, such as the cat being old and unlikely to cause damage. Perhaps include that she's spayed and that she's not a scratcher – whatever's true and puts people at ease.

Also, be specific that you're aware that you're liable for any damage your cat would cause. Offer to have the flat professionally cleaned at the end of the tenancy, instead of just you cleaning it. Be specific about having professional carpet cleaners and having the soft furnishings professionally cleaned (people being allergic is a big reason landlords don't want pets). Before you write the letter, get a quote from a local company on how much it would cost to have the whole place cleaned to that extent, and offer that much as an additional deposit against your word that you'll have it cleaned. Include the written quote if you can. If you're offering to have the carpets cleaned regularly then offer to forward copies of the invoices for the landlord, for his peace of mind, etc.

You're signed up now, they won't want to get rid of you, but they aren't going to want to let you bring a cat in if they think you're a bit of a waster.

Besides not being a fan of how timid a double pivot makes our midfield (I'm so sick and fucking tired of seeing Henderson having to sit back in a holding position when it's obvious his best form has been as the highest presser from a midfield three), Coutinho gets locked out of games way too easily as a 10.

Preferably we play a 442 diamond or a 433 single pivot which gives us two runners in front of a DM and encourages at least one of the front three to drop into the hole to link up play.

Now, if we start out with two holding mids like every season BR has been here, I think a 4-2-2-2 set up like this might work:

-------------Migs

Clyne-Skrtel-Sakho-Moreno

-------Hendo-Can

Milner-------------Coutinho

----------Firmino

----------Studge/healthy striker

Firmino would be a slightly deeper second striker and Coutinho and Milner would basically be 8s. With them tucking in a bit, overlaps would work nicely with one of the two holders and the FBs and would be as close to a diamond as we could get without having an out and out committed DM.

However, the language you have used it other posts (e.g. 'pakis') and ideas you were proposing (profiling all Asians because of the actions of a few from a community that is really different to other Asian communities) were/are clearly racist.

I also want to see a sensible debate about the core underlying issues that are afflicting those problematic communities and deal with them. Personally, I think that they are down to a nasty combination of a particular religion and the classes of the communities. For example, British Indian Asians are overwhelmingly non-Muslim and also come from the higher classes of the subcontinent. The British Pakistanis are overwhelmingly Muslim and come agricultural classes - imported for factory work. British Indians score amongst the top for exam results and end up being Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers etc. Pakistanis score amongst the lowest, and their community seems to be in the news for terrorism, honour killing and grooming all the time. Is it a class issue? Is it a religion issue? Is it a cultural issue? That's the question. 

But the real reason we will never find out is because the liberal left deliberately tries to obscure criticism of an Islamic community by trying to shift blame to all Asians (i.e. attempting to be less ""racist"" by making this a race issue wtf). And to compound it, right wing people like yourself using inflammatory language and suggesting racial profiling etc scares people into thinking that debating these important issues is legitimising racist thought and behaviour.

For *exceptional* successes they most likely have to be sold for a large sum, but probably not necessarily a huge one if they've put the game time in (Gerrard, Carra and probably Hyypia would probably be classed as such even though they all left for free, but they're not on the list for analysis because they weren't expensive transfers in). And it's more that in every player's career they'll hit a point where they can't perform at a top level any more - the good clubs will move them on for a reasonable fee just before that happens and becomes evident.

null,false,LocutusOfBorges,,Liberal Democrat | /r/LibDem,null,"&gt; Unfortunately his denial of responsibility shows just how ridiculous his position was. He blames everyone else and refuses to see the massive conflict that siding with the Tories brought.

This is slightly unreasonable - I'd say that much was more or less implicit. The expectated return of ~25 seats accounts for the *anticipated* collapse adequately. Lib-Lab marginals were the ones affected the most severely by the coalition- the seats the party was betting on its being able to hold were almost universally Lib-Con marginals, where the expectation was that we would be able to do a bit better. And, up until the line, polls suggested we were set to manage it- the 25 seat target was always a bit ridiculous, but nobody on any side of the spectrum anticipated the magnitude of the collapse we saw. 

&gt;It was never about Labour-SNP, it was a rejection of the principles and policies that won the LDs 56 seats.

Nationally, absolutely. But the party wasn't fighting a national campaign- it was throwing absolutely everything it had into holding a series of marginals. Tactical concerns overrode any national messaging there- bar charts blotting out the sun, and so on.

&gt;Sure, a change of leadership wouldn't have helped, but the whole ""country vs party"" crap is what killed the Lib Dems.

I agree. Completely.

So much of the party's spent the past five years living in a constructed reality of its own making- irrespective of how many times Clegg got wheeled before the cameras to parrot that risible, insipid ""Stronger Economy, Fairer Society"" mantra, the parliamentary party signed its own death warrant the instant it decided that ministerial careers and the short-term ascendency of Orange Book Liberalism trumped focusing on maintaining the continued, sustainable existence of a Liberal Democrat party that can *matter*.

In recent years Man Utd have paid £60m for Di Maria, £30m for Berbatov, £37m for Mata, £29m for Herrera, £27m for Shaw. And I'm sure if you factored in inflation then signings like £27m for Rooney in 2004, £28m for Ferdinand in 2002 and £29m for Veron in 2001 would come out bloody expensive too. 

Then you've got Chelsea paying £50m for Torres, and £30m back in 2005/06 for Shevchenko. Man City paying £40m for Mangala, and going back a few years without inflation they paid £25m for Balotelli (compared to our wasted £16m), £26m for Milner (now free for us), and £25m for Adebayor (to sell him for £5m, a few seasons and 19 goals later). 

We overpay on some players, definitely, but every other club at the top of the table does (with the exception of Arsenal but they've only recently started spending more than £15m at a time on anyone).

Well, do we normally describe the Unionist population of Northern Ireland as immigrants? They haven't adopted the mainstream culture of Ireland, but even the PIRA accept that they are there to stay. Are African-Americans immigrants?

Japan does not really officially recognize the concept of ethnic minorities, so the Zainichi Koreans have the choice between becoming ethnically Japanese and being stateless. In addition, many of them did not choose to move to Japan. It's very different from the people who've moved to the UK in the last 12 months.

&gt; Living standards in Japan actually fell when you take into account inflation.

Have you read the article you linked to? I used some of my precious *Economist* quota to do so, and the article's main point is that at the time of print, prices were falling while wages were constant: that made workers better off. The accompanying graph suggest that wages increases were well above inflation until the global financial crisis, since when both prices and wages have been on a downward trend. That's a problem if you're trying to pay off a mortgage, but my understanding is that most Japanese households have positive equity (you save up to buy a house), so it's no change.",null,0,null,1435278540,null,0,false,0,csivssa,null,t3_3b1z3i,null,t1_csivssa,null,t1_csisa3f,null,null,null,1437354815,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

 I think Benteke is all right, but Bacca is the finished product. We're probably the last big step up for him (he's 29 this year) but I could definitely see us getting at least two- three good years out of him. 

Ps. Wasn't everyone hating on Benteke yesterday? How did the pendulum swing so far so fast?

Pps. I know the fish and bus thing got nothing to do with his football, but I like the story of his humble beginnings. I feel he's hungry like Suarez ;-) and will shine with Studge by his side, or alone with Firmino and Coutinho feeding him passes.

When the 9 mutineers arrived on the island they were accompanied by 18 tahitians, 12 women and 6 men. They decided to take one woman each as wives, and leave the tahitian men 3 women between them to share.

When one of the mutineers was widowed, losing his wife to illness, they rolled dice to decide which one of the remaining three tahitian women he was going to rape instead. Because her husband was understandably angry about this they ended up killing him. 

I halfway feel like the current population had no chance to learn any better mores, considering this background against which successive generations were raised. But nevertheless, it's one of the most objectifying and blatantly racist things I've ever heard of. 

Today parts of Papua New Guinea remain much like this - it's remote and forested, most of the population live in rural villages, and literally half the male population admit to rape.
