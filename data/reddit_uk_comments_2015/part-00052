You can walk 10 miles a day and still be obese. You would be surprised at how little walking affects weight in comparison to food intake.

If a company in any sector want the privilege of carrying out operations in the UK they should minimise any detrimental effect this has on the population of the UK, as they are the ones granting this company that privilege. This can be extended to a current example- HSBC.

If you hear about anyone managing to hang their-selves by a space rocket from there.. that'll be me as I'm almost fed up of this silly place.  
We have 2 schools, and likely to be getting 2 or 3 more (secondary and primary) by 2020, it's not going to get any better.  
Unfortunately, this paints an accurate picture of the school run. Having lived opposite one of them on a busy road (we're talking haulage, goods vans, Basically everything what wants a short cut to the non far edge of town off the Bypass, or back along the south western areas cut off from the bypass.. Basically the big farms), It's clearly not safe for parking there.  
Police presence resulted in other issues.. for example Parents went on to residents driveways, slowed up the traffic at the town end and caused Police attention in that direction allowing the cheeky to park up and go before being spotted. There were even a few caught for other things who parked up while Police occasionally showed up, You'd think that would put them off.. Nope.  
The bad thing is, no disrespect to PCSO's, you will likely see there is 'Community Officers'.. Volunteers. Who shouldn't have to deal with the crap the parents give them.  
One thing I did suggest, which wouldn't be possible with that School, but the other and forthcoming ones could work: Close the road off forcing people to walk there, make it a hassle to use a car near there, which would include fines, traffic management and parking monitor stations (warning alarms when people stop, automatic alert to nearby officers).  
I remember also one of my neighbours who was quite an adventurous eccentric.. Great fella, bet he's still going! having trouble with a fire in the morning.. took the engine almost 30 minutes to get down 1/3rd of a mile of parents in cars..

- Pension fund is in deficit and contributions are relatively low while some people who had been working for Translink since the 50s are now drawing enormous pensions
- Poor and outdated management practices which haven't even kept pace with the Glacial change in the Civil Service

His starting position when he plays on the left is, well, on the left, he drifts inside from a wide starting position and his defensive duties are generally in the wide areas to support the leftback as well. That's what a winger does. Winger/wide mid does not mean one who stands on the touchline all of the time and never deviates from doing so. It's his base position from which he moves relatively freely when Spurs are in possession.

And everyone keeps focusing on Eriksen's possession and attacking contributions and saying he has done great in that role and he should play there but it ignores the defensive side of the game. He's gotten better over this season playing his defensive role but it can still be a liability.

Also have to keep in mind what his coming central does in relation to the rest of the team, it worked well against Arsenal because they were sitting deep and narrow and Eriksen's movement allowed Rose tons of space on the left which he used to good effect. But that is one instance, sometimes he comes inside and crowds the center but against a team pressing more actively Rose would find himself more isolated out wide by himself.

Chadli works in the wide areas very effectively and works well with Rose too so sometimes depending on the opponent he would be better than and Eriksen in the #10 role. It also depends on what is happening on the other side with Walker and Lamela. Lamela switches between keeping his width and coming inside from game to game or inside of a match itself. I don't know if he's instructed to do so or just does it on his own but whether or not Eriksen coming central is effective or not does also depend on what positions Lamela is taking up.

There is a strong conviction from people on here that he can work in a deeper role but he hasn't done so since he's been here and he's been here for a while now.

He's a very talented player but is also very limited in where his best attributes are useful. He's more of a threat further forward because his ability to win 1v1s higher up the field leaves him in positions where he can shoot, should he choose to start doing so, or the next pass he makes is to a player in a shooting position. His dominance in 1v1s deeper in midfield slowed things down and Spurs were still 2-3 passes away from someone receiving the ball in a shooting position.

He's not good enough to start over Eriksen, Chadli or Lamela and debatable whether he starts over Townsend, who's been making himself useful lately. But it doesn't matter because Pochettino rotates the squad so much he'll likely see time filling in for all three positions across the '3' line which is a good development.

As /u/frankster states, if you can give a priority to payments, put CC2 then ~~OD1~~ **OD2** *^Edit: ^Minor ^error* as your top priorities, as these are generating more debt by means of interest.

As a rough calculation, at the payments you put down (and not including the windfall) you should be clear of that amount in 13 months - which is pretty good going. I have a similar amount I'm trying to clear, and I'm looking closer to 2 years. So well done!

With your windfall, assuming you get Â£500, I'd put that towards CC2, which is costing you the most in terms of interest. An extra Â£500 in one month will save you about Â£50 in interest over the time you save. 

If you put it towards CC1 (at 0%) it will pay this off a little quicker, meaning you get Â£200 to use sooner, but the next effect is you'd only save Â£30 in interest.

I'm from Rhode Island, a small state, about an hour away from the city of Boston, which is one of the major sports towns in America. In the last 15 years, the city of Boston has had an unprecedented level of success in America's core 4 sports, NFL, basketball, baseball, and hockey. Each team has won a championship, the Patriots of the NFL have won 4, and the Red Sox have won 3. As a result of this, Boston fans and their teams are hated by everybody around the country.

Having supported 4 sports teams for most of my life, I didn't think I could get into another sport. Well, I was wrong, I became entranced with soccer once I watched the 2010 World Cup. I've had a weird, inexplicable love of the country of England, so when watching the World Cup, two players stuck out to me, these guys named Lampard and Gerrard. Rooney didn't impress me of course, because he didn't score a goal, and as a novice of soccer, Rooney seemed overhyped to me because the commentators kept on sucking him off on the broadcast. I discovered that Lampard and Gerrard played for Chelsea and Liverpool. One of my friends who was a huge soccer fan and a Blues fan, sent me an article comparing EPL franchises to American sports franchises to help me get a gist for the teams and their hierarchy and history. Chelsea was compared to the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool compared to the Boston Celtics. Even harder for my decision was that the Boston Red Sox ownership group, critical in the Red Sox's success, had just bought Liverpool FC. My friend who was a Blues fan recommended watching the teams and seeing who I liked better. On November 7, 2010, I set to watch the two teams play, and really couldn't form a conclusion about either team, although I thought that Torres lad who scored both goals was sensational. In the end, as a Bostonian at heart, I asked my friend who was the more hated of the two clubs. He told me about how Liverpool was the glorified team who was loved by most people, and how Chelsea was not only one of the most hated clubs in England, but in Europe as well. That sealed it for me. A few months later, we got Torres, and I was ecstatic. 

I've followed Chelsea FC ever since then, and I studied abroad in England last year and I went to the Bridge for FA Cup vs. Stoke last year in the Lower East Stand, and got to see Lampard, Hazard, and Oscar, my 3 favorite players, live and saw Oscar's amazing free kick goal in that game.

Saw it recently on a facebook post where someones daughter had encountered a flasher on her way home from school.  Obviously distressing for any parent (and child) but the prevailing attitude from just about everyone was that blaming the girls parents because shock-horror an 8 year old girl was walking home from school alone was the right response.

I'm still in my 20s (just) and walked to and from school from age 6, as did every one of my peers.  It was normal, accepted and the only kid who did get a lift to school was coming from outwith the catchment area for some special reason.

This wasn't long ago, some time in the late 90s this attitude rapidly changed amongst parents to the point now where letting your kids walk to school almost seems to be considered neglectful.  It even seems to extend to high school age kids.

As far as I can see the media is as shite and as manipulative as it ever has been regarding paedogeddon, certainly it has been for as long as I've been old enough to notice but this change in opinion - the idea that your kids being out on the streets alone is a near guarantee they will become headline news in the paper - has really taken hold and it's complete bullshit.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw it recently on a facebook post where someones daughter had encountered a flasher on her way home from school.  Obviously distressing for any parent (and child) but the prevailing attitude from just about everyone was that blaming the girls parents because shock-horror an 8 year old girl was walking home from school alone was the right response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still in my 20s (just) and walked to and from school from age 6, as did every one of my peers.  It was normal, accepted and the only kid who did get a lift to school was coming from outwith the catchment area for some special reason.&lt;/p&gt;

Well firstly, you're picking the parts of Christianity you feel best  suits your argument, there are plenty of people who follow the old testament, why is that deemed irrelevant? The Old Testemant is as violent as the Qu'ran. 


Also, you definitely haven't read the new testament either. If you have, it's one of the 'newly edited' versions available online, which reword all the horrific shit in the original New Testament. 


&gt;""Those who bear bad fruit will be cut down and burned ""with unquenchable fire.""

&gt;""Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death."" 

^Matthew ^10:21


&gt;He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.

^Matthew ^12:30 


&gt;Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.

^2 ^Kg.6:18


&gt;But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

^Luke ^19:27(Jesus ^speaking ^in ^a ^parable)


&gt;As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

^Matthew ^13:40-42 



&gt;""The children of the kingdom [the Jews] shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."" 

^Matthew ^8:12

&gt;""Beware, I am throwing [Jezebel] on a bed, and those who commit adultery with her I am throwing into great distress, unless they repent of her doings; and I will strike her children dead."" 

^(NRSV ^2:22-23)





&gt;Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division; for from now on five members in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three. They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.

&gt; You're going on like he's never played in that role before or can't, when he has done and absolutely can.
 
No I'm not, I've mentioned that he fills in when necessary but other players are favoured in the holding roles to give him more freedom going forward/out wide. Pogba, Matuidi, Schneiderlin, Colback, Anita, Tiote.

The only time I've outright said he isn't a position was when we were taking about DMs and you mentioned him alongside Tiote and De Jong. Clearly he has a different style and performs a different role to either of them.

What you can do vs what you do do.

Yeah our formation is dependent on our wide players coming in centrally.  **we never play with a winger on the left** Chadli doesn't play as a winger in the sense you guys are on about either.  If anything he's mostly a second striker. 

I feel as though you are stating an opinion that we play better with Eriksen in the middle that is wrong for 2 reasons. 

Firstly previously we had no one else to play in the 10 so we were worse when he didn't play there as Kane playing was a waste of his abilities &amp; Paulinho isn't good enough. Now it seems Dembele is good enough to play there and offers something Eriksen doesn't when he plays there.

Secondly I think you're wrong because looking at our performances with Eriksen out wide there we played better. Sherwood exclusively played him there to great success both for him and the team &amp; now Poch regularly utilises him there and has in the last 3 games at least, all of which we have won.

I think what this really about it how little everyone else seems to rate Dembele, which is what this thread is about. You clearly think Eriksen is wasted on the left and should play centrally. 

I think Dembele is potentially one our best players, has been a major contributing factor to our success since he has had a run in the team/ Deserves to keep his place behind Kane especially as Eriksen is more than capable of playing on the left. 

I can see why you would want Chadli back in the team and Eriksen back in the 10 but I disagree and I think the results we've had with Dembele in the 10 support my view. not yours ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are you and the other acting like I called him a winger?

It isn't questioning, the pictures are just a bigoted, hateful attack against innocent people via attacking their religious beliefs. There isn't a right of reply, there isn't a level playing field.  These cartoons are really just a thinly veiled attack against human beings, not just the ideas they hold. 

No doubt when Muslims are lining up to mock and ridicule dead servicemen as they are being lowered into graves or simply carrying mock coffins along wootton basset you'll be marching alongside them defending their freedom of speech rights even as they get their cocks out to piss on the coffin. 

After all its just freedom of speech eh. 

Freedom of speech isn't worth a rats arse if you are only defending what you feel comfortable with. You must defend the ranting jihadis who hate this country and think our state, our queen and your mother are pieces of shit not worth pissing on if they are on fire.

If you aren't defending that then you are an absolute hypocrite. You should be standing alongside those people, wallowing in their free speech rights. Punching the air, shouting ""fuck yeah"" when they say something that personally offends you. 

Because to say anything you like at any time to anyone regardless of how they feel is a **GREAT BRITISH VALUE** after, it's how this country works and has always worked eh, it doesn't matter how many people you insult in the process.

I personally see these things as an attack against people though the medium of the their religious beliefs.

lol, rather ""the only 'narrative' that actually makes any fucking sense in the real world.""

&gt; It is possible that Assange is cynically avoiding the charges being brought against him by invoking the spectre of US bogeymen, but it does seem an odd choice if so

Why? It is one that a good number of his supporters have unconditionally accepted, because it taps into their pre-existing concept of a villainous, all-powerful, lawless United States that will stop at nothing to crush anyone it deems an enemy and will utilise all means, fair and foul, to do so. (That it apparently *does* stop at extraditing him from a very US-friendly country with an extradition treaty that is quite slanted in favour of the US, in favour of waiting for him to be arrested and sent to a rather less friendly country without such a treaty, never seems to feature in this concept.)

&gt; You've not really addressed why he would choose confinement for such extended periods rather than simply dealing with charges. Increasingly he has been confined in the embassy for longer than he could possibly have expected to have been confined if he submitted to the Swedish justice system. You haven't really answered why he would do this.

Here's a reason why; because people don't like going to jail, and he has a convenient out in the form of a nation hostile to the US that is willing to give him asylum. He has an option of either willingly living an embassy with more or less as much freedom to do what he wants, or unwillingly go to jail. Those are his choices, and he's chosen living more or less freely in the embassy.

(I don't know if a statute of limitations applies also, so he could spend x years in prison and then pop out scot free, like some fugitive jack-in-the-box.)

&gt; The other alternative is that he believes, rightly or wrongly, that his life and liberty are more at risk in Sweden than the UK.

He can believe that all he wants, but it doesn't make it true.

It also doesn't mean that he *actually believes that*. Remember - very convenient boogieman for him.

&gt; There are reasons he might think that: Sweden has a history of extraordinary rendition that is more extreme than the UK's

Citation ***severely*** needed.

&gt; he would already be in custody in Sweden which would allow for easier access via police contacts for US authorities (who they tend to prefer to operate through)

And for this. Both from actual credible sources.

&gt; However, say he is wrong and he is hiding in the embassy pointlessly. He is clearly, if this is the case, mentally unwell. And perhaps should be pitied rather than hated.

I will gladly hate anyone who hides like a coward from charges of sexual assault while relying on his global fanbase to alternately spread shit and personal information about the people he (allegedly) assaulted and his chosen ""narrative"" (god that word makes me sick) that it's a trap laid by the big bad USA.

&lt;p&gt;The actual management post-crash is something you can blame on Labour, but I think their management was fairly good - instantly push some QE on the market, credibly signal protection of consumer banks and try to work with Eurozone leaders to prevent a catastrophic collapse of our biggest export market. I&amp;#39;m not sure what the Tories would have done differently in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

Last year we all put it down to new management, new system. This year that excuse has gone, and it's been replaced by injury, but underneath that I don't think Kompany has been his world class best under Pellegrini apart from one or two massive games. 

Pellegrini's system is really hard to play for defenders. We saw that last year where we kept having mishaps at the back. At the time there was a lot of blame for Demichelis, who'd played under Pellegrini for years, but in actual fact it was as much the other 3 not knowing what to do around Demichelis rather than him consistently making mistakes on his own. This season we have seen it where one of the best young defenders in the world has been signed and looked average at best. 

We get consistently carved open very easily by teams that don't actually have that much attacking threat. Around the box, we always look likely to concede a penalty, and in general there is an air of panic amongst the back four that usually relies on whichever defender is having a great game to clear it up single handedly. Sometimes it's Demi, sometimes Vinny, Zaba or recently Clichy. 

Last year we nearly set a goal scoring record so it didn't matter that we were shaky at the back, this year, injuries have deprived us of our best attacking players, teams are working out how to stop us and suddenly the fact we have a very porous defence is costing us points, and ultimately if it isn't sorted fast, the title, even though we spent Â£40m on the defence over the summer.

I moved out from my parents place when I was 21 and have saved Â£30k so far.

There might be times when you need to cut back and canât buy everything you want every month but again, itâs about balance.

Committing to the time was -- for me -- the biggest issue.  OU degree-level courses are given a certain number of ""points"" generally corresponding to the amount of work required to complete that course. A typical OU honours degree will require 360 points of courses.

Working full-time I found it hard to do more than one 60-point or two 30-point courses per year. So at that rate it's 6 years to get your degree. Of course your personal circumstances make a big difference as to how much time you can give, but don't underestimate how much of an effort you'll be putting in.

Of course you don't necessarily have to complete the whole degree, if you're only interested in certain subject matters then just follow those. There are still certifications available even if you don't complete a full degree course (check on http://www.open.ac.uk for details for the course(s) you're interested in). But a degree is very worth having.

I am a bit confused by this? Do you mean pre-season? Because he was one of our very best players. Or the start of the season? Which again he was very good which is why started our first game and got the winning assist. In fact, the first few weeks were probably his best times here.

&gt; ks. Do you expect Jose to just hand him playing time, if he wasn't training really hard?

He was though, at least as far as we know. Jose said he was training very hard and he is known generally to be a very hard worker.

&gt;  Him not playing frequently was the main reason that led to his attitude problems. After his attitude problems

I am not sure what these problems are? Asking to play is an attitude problem? You can't just let yourself rot on the bench.. He didn't insult anyone or call anybody out. So not sure where you are going with this. He seemed to do exactly what you are supposed to do, train hard and tell your coach your unhappy with your playing time and hope your situation changes, which it didn't.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a bit confused by this? Do you mean pre-season? Because he was one of our very best players. Or the start of the season? Which again he was very good which is why started our first game and got the winning assist. In fact, the first few weeks were probably his best times here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ks. Do you expect Jose to just hand him playing time, if he wasn&amp;#39;t training really hard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was though, at least as far as we know. Jose said he was training very hard and he is known generally to be a very hard worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Him not playing frequently was the main reason that led to his attitude problems. After his attitude problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what these problems are? Asking to play is an attitude problem? You can&amp;#39;t just let yourself rot on the bench.. He didn&amp;#39;t insult anyone or call anybody out. So not sure where you are going with this. He seemed to do exactly what you are supposed to do, train hard and tell your coach your unhappy with your playing time and hope your situation changes, which it didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

Randolph Crescent commemorates an earlier Earl of Moray, Sir Thomas Randolph who was a lieutenant to Robert The Bruce. In the 1820/30s a huge amount of development was happening in that area with The Dean Bridge being completed in 1831. Which gave much better access over the Dean Valley. Before the opening of the Dean Bridge you had to go through the Dean Village and up Bells Brae, that is a steep hill and horses pulling heavy loads often couldn't get up it so they had to cross the river using the now demolished bridge at Bells Mills off Belford Road.


Belford Road was previously called Queensferry Road. When the  Dean Bridge was completed the new road was called Queensferry Road and the original route to Old Queensferry Road. It was renamed to Belford Road in 1887

David Black â the first chairman of Edinburghâs Southside Association â is compiling a report on what he sees as planning decisions which are destroying Edinburghâs historic cityscape.

His report is to be sent to Unescoâs New York HQ next month in a bid to have the cityâs prestigious status, which it has had since 1995, removed.

Mr Black said: âAt the time [1995], Edinburgh was seen as a prime example of an old town and new town co-existing well. But since then we have seen one poor planning decision after another, from St Andrew Square to the Parliament building and Princes Street.

âThis is not just some old fogey talking who doesnât like anything modern. I like the Festival Theatre, for example. But I think there is a balance to be struck between preserving the best of the new â and what weâre getting generally is not the best.â

He said the latest architectural disaster to hit the city is the plan to transform the 190-year -old Royal High School into a five-star hotel.

City planning leader Councillor Ian Perry said: âOur status is something the council takes very seriously, and we will continue to support and work closely with Historic Scotland and Edinburgh World Heritage to maintain this.â","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A LEADING conservationist is calling on Unesco to remove Edinburgh of its world heritage status after a number of âarchitectural blundersâ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Black said: âAt the time [1995], Edinburgh was seen as a prime example of an old town and new town co-existing well. But since then we have seen one poor planning decision after another, from St Andrew Square to the Parliament building and Princes Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âThis is not just some old fogey talking who doesnât like anything modern. I like the Festival Theatre, for example. But I think there is a balance to be struck between preserving the best of the new â and what weâre getting generally is not the best.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the latest architectural disaster to hit the city is the plan to transform the 190-year -old Royal High School into a five-star hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City planning leader Councillor Ian Perry said: âOur status is something the council takes very seriously, and we will continue to support and work closely with Historic Scotland and Edinburgh World Heritage to maintain this.â&lt;/p&gt;

1) You are in a fantastic position to save money right now, so if your goal is to clear debt and build capital, keep doing what you're doing. Be aware however that in my opinion living in a shared house in your 20s is a great experience; not only does it teach you to get on with a wide range of personality types, it (should) teach you to be clean, respectful and provides a good way of meeting new friends and is a great way to meet potential partners. You will of course have to ferret less away in your savings account for the privilege, but personally I would say save some, enjoy the rest in your 20s in a shared house. Renting by yourself is expensive when you factor in all the utilities.

2) You spend a lot of time away, but do you also get some time on the bench? It's this downtime which would be great if you lived in a shared house. You could catch up with friends/housemates and spend some of the hard earned cash. Also, you have people to talk to and are out of your family's hair.

3) I currently own a flat, so it doesn't seem like I'm throwing a lot of money away whilst I'm away; but you have to accept that by being away you are also not benefitting from the council tax you're paying, broadband, TV licence etc. which are all things which would probably be included in some shared houses. In addition, your own property takes some upkeep and maintenance, and if you're away a lot this means you've gotta squash these jobs into the weekends. 

4) I don't know what kind of expenses scheme your job has but many allow you to book all your own travel etc. in which case you want to start using a rewards credit card and building up loyalty points etc. for different airlines and hotels.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a consultant in a similar position and thought I&amp;#39;d share a few thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

As I'm sure you're aware already cliffski the overall budget has remained more or less unchanged in real terms.

If you've been following news you will also be aware that this re-organisation has been described as ""disastrous"" by the independent think tank King's Fund, a report that came as a surprise to no-one as this is what medical professionals inside the NHS have been saying for years.

The NHS is now in crisis, A&amp;E waiting time targets are not being met, it is struggling to cope.

In order to deal with the additional costs of an ageing and growing population, the NHS need an extra Â£8 billion. Labour have come some way to raising this figure, through their often derided mansion tax. Though the Tories and right-wingers in general love to attack the mansion tax, they have yet to come up with an alternative proposal that would save the NHS.

&gt;

&gt;The __Salisbury Convention__ (officially called the __Salisbury Doctrine__,  the __Salisbury-Addison Convention__ or the __Salisbury/Addison Convention__) is a [constitutional convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom\)) in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) under which the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords) will not oppose the [second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_reading) or [third reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_reading) of any government legislation promised in its election [manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto). 

&gt;Following a landslide [Labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK\)) [general election victory in 1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945), there were only 16 [Labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK\)) peers in the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords), led by [Lord Addison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Addison,_1st_Viscount_Addison). Throughout the 20th century, the second chamber had an in-built Conservative majority. However, it was believed that because [Clement Attlee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Attlee)'s Labour government had a clear mandate to deliver the policies of [nationalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalisation) and [welfare state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state) measures, the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords) should not oppose such legislation at second reading.

&gt;Lord Addison and [Lord Salisbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil,_5th_Marquess_of_Salisbury) (then Lord Cranborne), the Conservative leader in the House of Lords from 1942 to 1957, both with memories of the troubles leading to the passing of the [Parliament Act 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911), agreed that anything promised in a party's manifesto would eventually pass; anything else would be subject to full debate. In its modern form, the convention still permits the offering of reasoned amendments to a motion for second reading of a Government [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(proposed_law\)), provided such amendments are not [wrecking amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrecking_amendments) designed to destroy the bill.

null,false,Dardanator,null,null,null,"Their view is that the UK is a political union of four countries much like the EU itself is, and therefore the entire union should not take actions not endorsed by all of its members. This parallels with the EU being unable to make major changes without the consent of all of its members, or how the UN Security Council (for example) needs the approval of all of its permanent members to pass a resolution.

The problem is that their view is simply wrong. The UK is a single country - a unitary state. It is not a political union. The fact that it's divided into four distinctive areas that call themselves nations is not relevant, any region can become a nation if it so chooses, and being a nation doesn't mean anything. They're entitled to hold their view that the UK should be a union of countries and not a single country itself, but if they want that to mean anything then they must first push for and secure the change.

I've never felt that Wales is that different from the rest of the UK. We have our own flag, language and national anthem and I enjoy that. But outside of that there's bugger all that distinguishes us from the rest of the country. In terms of its culture and society, Wales is diverse, I don't feel there's any overriding features across all of Welsh society that make us different - specifically, I don't think there's anything about Wales that makes us inclined to vote significantly differently to the rest of the country that would justify what Leanne Wood is proposing. So she's asking for something that strongly damages the idea of democracy all for the sake of us having our own flag and anthem, and that we call ourselves a nation (without justifying what a nation is or why it even matters).

As for why I think it's a danger to democracy, it makes any referendum incredibly biased against the campaign for the change. If a referendum on leaving the EU had to achieve a yes majority in all four home nations, then the no campaign (the campaign against leaving) would only have to succeed in one to get what they want. They could pool all their resources into campaigning in Northern Ireland and win over at least half of its population. They would only need to secure the votes of 900,000 people (1.4% of the British population) to get their way. Whereas the yes campaign would have to win over all four home nations and secure the votes of at least 50% of the population.

Imagine if, in the recent scottish independence referendum, all local authority areas apart from one had a majority for yes, but independence was blocked because of the one that voted no and the government said it would be unfair for that one region to be subject to a major political change they didn't vote for. And again, the no campaign would have had the comparatively easy task of securing a majority in only one LA in Scotland. I'm sure Nicola Sturgeon and Leanne Wood would both be furious, but it's what they're asking for here.

There is the distinction that the local authority areas of Scotland are not nations, whereas Scotland and Wales are. But again, why does this matter? That, I think, is the biggest ideological difference between myself and the nationalist parties. I do not understand why they hold on so strongly to the concept of a nation and see it as some divinely powerful designation that must overrule political decisions. I think a nation is nothing more than a wider community, a grouping of people who share a similar identity and culture. There exist similar groupings at higher and lower levels, so why is that one so special that it must affect politics and democracy?

As a side note, the SNP at least have the argument that polls show the scottish population are more in favour of remaining in the EU than the wider UK population.

Because protesting over being offended is, quite frankly, pathetic. How feeble-minded do you have to be to choose to protest because you are *offended*?

Free-speech is not appalling.

&gt;It's because they are muslims isn't it, you don't feel muslims should have any rights do you,

How dare you put words in my mouth.

Do not insinuate that I am somehow anti-Muslim because I believe these particular people are in the wrong. I'd have exactly the same opinion if this was any group of people who'd chosen to be offended.

&gt; they just have to suck up all the insults and the mockery and have no right of reply. 

Perhaps they should be replying to the people that drew the cartoon?

&gt;Fuck the muslims, we can and shall insult them as is our want 

Yes, I will insult anyone and everyone that I see fit.

&gt;if they so much as make a peep in protest then they are in the wrong. Is that fair?

It's absolutely fair. As I've already said, protesting about being offended is hilariously weak.

&gt;They have the right to protest things that they consider deeply offensive.

They have the right to yes. Doesn't mean it isn't utterly ridiculous.

Do not waste taxpayer money and time protesting over a complete non-issue.

If you're deeply offended by something, that is entirely your own problem.

&gt;You really dont get the fact that free speech really isnt that free, try posting an anti-semitic cartoon in a british publication and you will find out where the limits to your free speech lies and what will follow will be a wave of apologies for being so insensitive....

These are private apologising for something to save face; there are no limitations of the right to free speech here.

It is extraordinarily uncommon for British publications to show images of Mohammed because of the ridiculous overreaction of some Muslims.

&gt;But it's fair game when it's muslims that are being attacked, because that fits in to the anti muslim propaganda being pushed by our state and their media to support the war on muslims and their beliefs.

No, this is a narrative you have fabricated. This country is extremely sensitive to Muslims and their feelings. As I've already said, direct mocking of the Islamic faith is very rare indeed.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one actually chooses to be insulted, what a ridiculous idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not in any way ridiculous. If you choose to be a Muslim, you choose to allow yourself to be insulted. It&amp;#39;s as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot insult someone who chooses not to be offended by what you say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s exactly what it is. There was no violence, there were no arrests. It was an entirely peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something being non-violent does not make it &amp;#39;polite&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why were they protesting to people who have nothing to do with the situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how democracy works.&lt;/p&gt;

null,false,calculusprime,null,null,null,"Ok, I don't want to be disrespectful to your personal family case. You've raised it obliquely several times but then indicated your wish not to say anymore. I can respect that. 

I would like to say though that EVERY troubles-related death was a complete human tragedy for the families involved and was a grave waste of precious human life, and ultimately completely unnecessary in the grand historical schema. While I'm no Niall Ferguson counterfactual specialist, it seems to me clear that there is NOTHING that was 'achieved' at the end of the troubles, that could not have been achieved, and indeed more, without the violence. For example, Provo violence killed off liberal unionism and its possibilities in a big and quite calamatous way. Ref Terence O'Neill, Brian Faulkner, etc. A counterfactualist could make a strong case in my view that more would have been achieved on civil rights, more quickly, with a society more at peace with itself at the end, had we not been blessed with the mandateless violence-laden interventions of Mr Adams, McGuinness et al.

What I do also wish to say though, in the politest terms that the currency of reddit debate can allow, is please don't labour under a belief that yours might be the only troubles-related family loss experienced by contributors to this subreddit. In fact I rather know quite emphatically that not to be the case, and some contributors may have lost rather a substantial number of family members. ALL who have lost have suffered and debating the past in Northern Ireland should not become an ugly grief contest in the slightest. But nor is it a trump card to use in a discussion about general causation of the Troubles. (Its not that I'm accusing you of that either - please understand me correctly). 

My point was not that you 'know nothing' about the troubles (please quote me if you think that incorrect) but that to emphatically state as you did: *""We all saw what happened to anybody that showed any smidgeon of nationalism back then, we all saw the peaceful protests and what happened them etc etc. It was only through violence that the peaceful solution became possible""* is an EXTREMELY contestable proposition.

How many people of nationalist disposition were either killed or even disabled by the authorities 1960-68 for example?

Rough treated, I have little doubt. 

Unfairly treated, quite possibly on occasion. 

But what came after (over 3,500 killed, 47,000 injured) was not in the least means justified by what came before. 

(Also, by-the-by, reference the number of fleggers claiming maltreatment by the authorities at present. One or two may even have a case. It doesn't support them launching a 40 year campaign of violence however).

And as a very recent post on this subreddit demonstrates through visual evidence, be under no illusion that the Derry protestors of the 1960s were sunflower-carrying peaceniks.

As to your final paragraph. This is not a contest of ""who saw what"" - though, yes, I did see enough 'live action' in the 1980s and 1990s to know that the feckless and inarticulate shitbags who recreationally riot, throw petrol bombs at law enforcement officers, all whilst claiming their ""yumoon rights"" have been grossly transgressed today, are the same as those who came before, and before that, and before that. We've been at this (and pathetically excusing it) since the 1890s and before.... 

My point is there is a massive amount of 'interpretation' about the past in current times that is being passed off cheaply, and somewhat thoughtlessly, as 'fact'. 

I'll reserve the right to challenge it where I see it.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, I don&amp;#39;t want to be disrespectful to your personal family case. You&amp;#39;ve raised it obliquely several times but then indicated your wish not to say anymore. I can respect that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to say though that EVERY troubles-related death was a complete human tragedy for the families involved and was a grave waste of precious human life, and ultimately completely unnecessary in the grand historical schema. While I&amp;#39;m no Niall Ferguson counterfactual specialist, it seems to me clear that there is NOTHING that was &amp;#39;achieved&amp;#39; at the end of the troubles, that could not have been achieved, and indeed more, without the violence. For example, Provo violence killed off liberal unionism and its possibilities in a big and quite calamatous way. Ref Terence O&amp;#39;Neill, Brian Faulkner, etc. A counterfactualist could make a strong case in my view that more would have been achieved on civil rights, more quickly, with a society more at peace with itself at the end, had we not been blessed with the mandateless violence-laden interventions of Mr Adams, McGuinness et al.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I do also wish to say though, in the politest terms that the currency of reddit debate can allow, is please don&amp;#39;t labour under a belief that yours might be the only troubles-related family loss experienced by contributors to this subreddit. In fact I rather know quite emphatically that not to be the case, and some contributors may have lost rather a substantial number of family members. ALL who have lost have suffered and debating the past in Northern Ireland should not become an ugly grief contest in the slightest. But nor is it a trump card to use in a discussion about general causation of the Troubles. (Its not that I&amp;#39;m accusing you of that either - please understand me correctly). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point was not that you &amp;#39;know nothing&amp;#39; about the troubles (please quote me if you think that incorrect) but that to emphatically state as you did: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;We all saw what happened to anybody that showed any smidgeon of nationalism back then, we all saw the peaceful protests and what happened them etc etc. It was only through violence that the peaceful solution became possible&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; is an EXTREMELY contestable proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people of nationalist disposition were either killed or even disabled by the authorities 1960-68 for example?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rough treated, I have little doubt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfairly treated, quite possibly on occasion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what came after (over 3,500 killed, 47,000 injured) was not in the least means justified by what came before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, by-the-by, reference the number of fleggers claiming maltreatment by the authorities at present. One or two may even have a case. It doesn&amp;#39;t support them launching a 40 year campaign of violence however).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a very recent post on this subreddit demonstrates through visual evidence, be under no illusion that the Derry protestors of the 1960s were sunflower-carrying peaceniks. I see in those photographs quite alot of mob delight in the throwing of live flames onto policemen, regardless of what disfiguring lifetime injuries the depicted individual with skin set alight might sustain.&lt;/p&gt;

As for my Practical, got it on a BH monday, so no school traffic (bonus!!) chatted to instructor and he understood my aims for getting license (30 mile commute) driving instructor in back seat.

First task, Reverse bay park, 3 attempts, instructor joking with me, calms me down and away we go, onto the roads, several times asked to pull over and stop, wait a few mins then go.

Reverse round a corner, managed it (just) then away we go.

Back to centre, advised I 'Just' Passed, if I had pulled forward one more time in bay parking, he would have failed me, reverse parking, 1 more inch out, he would have failed me, slightly too fast in school zone, spotted and slowed.

&gt;

&gt;During the 1982 [Falklands War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War), __Operations Black Buck 1__ to __Black Buck 7__ were a series of seven extremely long-range ground attack missions by [Royal Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force) [Vulcan bombers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Vulcan) of the RAF Waddington Wing, comprising aircraft from [44 Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._44_Squadron_RAF), [50 Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._50_Squadron_RAF), [101 Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._101_Squadron_RAF) planned against [Argentine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina) positions in the [Falkland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands), of which five were actually flown.

&gt;The Operation Black Buck raids were staged from [RAF Ascension Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Ascension_Island), close to the equator. The aircraft carried either twenty-one 1,000Â lb bombs internally or two or four [Shrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-45_Shrike) anti-radar missiles externally. The overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to determine. The raids did minimal damage to the runway and damage to radars was quickly repaired. Commonly dismissed as post-war propaganda,  Argentine sources originally claimed that the Vulcan raids influenced Argentina to withdraw some of their [Dassault Mirage III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Mirage_III) [fighter aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft) from the Southern Argentina Defence Zone to the Buenos Aires Defence Zone.    This dissuasive effect was however watered down when British officials made clear that there would be no strikes on air bases in Argentina.  It has been suggested that the Black Buck raids were pressed home by the Royal Air Force  because the British armed forces had been cut in the late seventies and the RAF may have desired a greater role in the conflict to prevent further cuts. 

&gt;A single crater was produced on the runway, rendering it impossible for the airfield to be used by fast jets.  Argentine ground crew repaired the runway  within twenty-four hours,  to a level of quality suitable for the [C-130 Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-130_Hercules) and [Aermacchi MB-339](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aermacchi_MB-339) light attack jets.  Many sources claim that fake craters confounded British damage assessment; [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] however, the British were well aware that the runway remained in use by C-130 [military transport aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft) and [IA 58 PucarÃ¡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA_58_Pucar%C3%A1) [ground-attack aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-attack_aircraft). 

&gt;The Vulcan lacked the range to fly to the Falklands without refuelling several times, as it had been designed for medium-range stand-off nuclear missions in Europe. The RAF's tanker planes were mostly converted [Handley Page Victor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Victor) bombers with similar range, so they too had to be refuelled in the air. A total of 11 tankers were required for two Vulcans, a huge [logistical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics) effort as all aircraft had to use the same strip.

&gt;The raids, at almost 6,800 [nautical miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile) (12,600Â [km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometre)) and 16 hours for the return journey, were the longest-ranged bombing raids in history at that time (surpassed in the [Gulf War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War) of 1991 by [USAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force) [Boeing B-52G Stratofortresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-52_Stratofortress) flying from the continental United States but using forward-positioned tankers ).

&gt;Of the five Black Buck raids flown to completion, three were against Stanley Airfield, with the other two anti-radar missions using [Shrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-45_Shrike) [anti-radiation missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-radiation_missile).

http://discover-the-truth.com/2013/09/14/bible-child-marriage-in-ancient-israelite-times-paedophilia/

&gt; In Biblical times people were married at a very young age. Girls were usually betrothed before they reached puberty â majority of the time the marriage would have consummated when the girl reached puberty, and that was usually between the ages of 8, 9 or older,(Note: when a girl reached puberty prior to the 20th century, she was considered to be an adult in most cultures/societies). In this article I will mostly quote Scholarly sources to prove that marriage in ancient Israelite times took place at a very young age, sometimes the girls who were married off were pre-pubescent. There was no law against a pre-pubescent girl being married off. Actually as you will read further, you will come to realise that the Mishnah gave approval for a Man to have intercourse to a betrothed girl, any-time after the age of three years old.

&gt; Isaacâs wife was Rebecca, mother of Jacob, and Esua. According to calculations made by Rabbi Solomon Itzhaki (A.K.A. Rashi a well-known respected Jewish Scholar), Rebecca was three years old when she married Isaac.

It's weak because it is judging historical figures against current laws, which is ridiculous. What may seem abhorrent in our current age was a norm back then, and therefore it is impossible to judge it rationally.

In short, no Mohammed wasn't a pedophile (the term itself was only coined in the last couple of hundred years), and insinuating that he was is rather childish and silly. Then again, whether he even existed at all is a far more important question.

I hate to destroy your little straw man but it's not at all what they're asking. If you recognize that the Home Nations are different and these constitute the UK then that's not comparable to a local authority that has only local powers. The Home Nations have power that transcend those kinds of regionalizations and already have different legal, educational and legislative systems and institutions to deal with almost all aspects of life. Thus, you are comparing administrative regions to working quasi-sovereignties (under the absolute sovereignty of the UK). Apples and oranges.

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beheading_in_Islamism):

&gt;Muhammad has been described as involved in beheadings. The Jewish tribe of the Banu Qurayza is described in various hadith. 800-900 men from this tribe were beheaded on the orders of Muhammad:

&gt;""The Jews were made to come down, and Allahâs Messenger imprisoned them. Then the Prophet went out into the marketplace of Medina (it is still its marketplace today), and he had trenches dug in it. He sent for the Jewish men and had them beheaded in those trenches. They were brought out to him in batches. They numbered 800 to 900 boys and men. As they were being taken in small groups to the Prophet, they said to one another, âWhat do you think will be done to us?â Someone said, 'Do you not understand. On each occasion do you not see that the summoner never stops? He does not discharge anyone. And that those who are taken away do not come back. By God, it is death!' The affair continued until the Messenger of Allah had finished with them all.""

1) Treat nearly every driving lesson from then on out as a battery of driving tests (get your instructor to role-play). The idea behind this is that you need to acclimatise to the test atmosphere.

3) Open up google maps street view of the area your tests happen in and set yourself a mock lesson.

This wasn't how a lot of markets reacted, many, including the gilt market, reacted positively to the news of the coalition, some would say the cheaper prices where due to certainty around the election result, as in the run-up people were very worried about a hung parliament.  Others suggest investor confidence in the Tories, being the big win.

I don't know a source of public reliable data that tracks just consumer stock components of the FTSE, but in 2010 the first big dip was a combination of things, not just economic performance of the UK, but the oil spill and greek concerns, again in 2011 the big dip in the FTSE was sparked by the London Riots.

&gt; That leads back to what I mentioned in the above paragraph.

The question would be, where would the money come from, it's an often debated point how effective such stimulus is, most investors tend to not like it, as it is risky.  Imagine if the government just handed out say Â£10k to each person in the UK over 18, and borrowed the money to do that, would they see a sustainable return on that?  Probably not, a lot would simply go on short term consumption, often imported, other metrics say asset inflation too.

This is the bit I didn't see.  I don't recall anyone talking about a change in tactic in a serious manner.  For many businesses schemes such as SEIS and EIS help kick start them more, I can certainly attest to that.  I don't really recall anything that changed which would have provided say consumer confidence or similar.

The other thing is, people are often quick to criticise such things, but you can have an oscillatory response in a steady state system, often being the best available solution.

This is why I really quite like QE in a way, people make it sound as if it's handing the banks free money, it isn't, it's robbing us via inflation, but penalises those whom are sitting on money, it's a clever buy-back scheme in many ways.

However this also had the result of helping drive inflation, which also had many factors outside of our control, food which is often dependant on oil prices, went up, I would say the recent drop in inflation is in no way thanks to our current government policies, unless they've been doing things in Saudi I'm not aware of.

I guess to me it appears they've done a 3 out of 5.  Not bad, certainly not good.

Feminism happened, to start with.

The potential work force doubled, and we made huge productivity gains. 

Rather than the great leap forward for equality that it should have been, it became an opportunity for business owners to exploit. Shrewd entrepreneurs saw this as a chance to drive down wages and employment conditions on the back of newly-available workforce, and make more profit thanks to increased margins and productivity. Those working in less well paid jobs began to see the benefit or necessity of having two parents working instead of one.

Decades later, wages haven't kept up with inflation, profits have risen at the expense of the workforce, and unless you're moderately wealthy, you need two salaries to comfortably support a family.

but lets ignore that for a second.

when considering contract negotiations, think about it as player comparisons. Player X signs a new deal and now there is a basis for comparison for similarly aged/talented players. Make sense? 

ok. luke shaw is younger than sterling and signs a mega deal. guess what? thats now the basis for all young english potential superstars now. who do you think should be worth more? raheem sterling or luke shaw? ok now imagine raheem doesnt get compensated (salary=appreciation) in line with how much more valuable he is to his team than luke shaw is to his team. thats why hes not just signing the first deal that they offer.

it doesnt matter that Man U has more money than liverpool - someone in the market has said ""a teenage english player is worth a kajillion dollars a week to our business"". thats what liverpool competes with. not greed. the market for english players is inflated relative to on-field production because their value to the business (by way of merchandise and sponsorship) is much higher than normal players.

dont lose sight over who is making the billions here. if anything, we should be on the players side... these teams make a fortune off these guys.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;throw out your normal comparisons. if youre raheem sterlings agent, its your job to get the man the best possible deal. best case scenario, raheem can make this kind of money for another 10 years or so. then its over. not to mention he could explode his knee and be done for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but lets ignore that for a second.&lt;/p&gt;

* If you are an EU citizen and *employed in the UK, have been employed in the UK or are a long term resident (more than 5 years; regardless of employment)* you are entitled to free NHS care like any other UK citizen (or the same cost if the NHS charges foe the service - such as Dentistry, Prescription charges etc). The UK pays. In fact any non-EU citizen who is legally working in the uk for a UK registered employer, or foreign students on courses longer than 6 months also get this.

* If you are an EU citizen and are *only visiting the UK* you need a European Health Insurance Card (E111) or you may be charged for the services used. If you have an E111 then you pay nothing up front (like a UK citizen) but your resident country will be charged the cost behind the scenes. Without an E111 you may be charged but should eventually be able to claim it back - but health is expensive so don't take the risk. The E111 is free.

* If you are an EU citizen *resident in the UK but are unemployed or, in particular, have never been employed in the UK* you can *potentially* be charged for NHS use. It is a myth that all EU citizens are entitled to automatic UK NHS cover (or automatic cover in any other EU country). An unemployed EU citizen would only be charged if there is a strong suspicion that they are not genuinely in the UK for work but to draw social security. One of the key tests is the EU's Habitual Residence criteria - all EU states can apply this test. However a further ""right to reside"" test exists on top of this in the UK . The European Commission is taking the UK to the European Court of Justice over this test ([EU press release on this issue](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-475_en.htm)) but at present EU citizens need to be aware of the potential to be charged to use the NHS.

I included it as just one short, easy to read piece of evidence to counter your claim that inequality is actually decreasing, as an additional source of data to accompany what /u/chrisjd posted.

Inequality is measured by many metrics, social mobility is one of them, and a pretty good indicator at that, because is social mobility is down then that means other divisions within society are up.  People mobility in education is down, that suggests that less people are able to afford the rising cost of education, meaning only the really well off can afford it.  If only the really well off can afford a decent education, then it's only those people that are going to get the better jobs, thus earning more money, whilst the poor sods at the bottom that couldn't afford it, are left with the shitty work.  That a slightly over simplified version but it tends to be the way it goes.


If you want more easily digested numbers, look at the rise in the number of people using food banks [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27032642) and [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30832524)  If there wasn't a growing inequality gap, then there wouldn't be a growing need to use food banks at those 900k people could have afforded it.

Or how the richest 10% of households hold 44% of all wealth.  The poorest 50% own just 9.5%. [here](http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/about-inequality/scale-and-trends/scale-economic-inequality-uk)

The only glimmer positivity in the figures presented there is that compared to other countries, we appear to have a fairly even distribution, that just makes me sad for everyone else, but doesn't negate the fact there is still a huge inequality gap. 

Or simply things like the cost of living rising [here] (http://imgur.com/XhNABMr) sourced from [here](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/family-spending/family-spending/family-spending-2012-edition/index.html)

Which shows expenditure fluctuating all over the place, but with the basics, like housing, transport, going up (though I will admit from those figures alone it's hard to extrapolate a precise sense of what is happening, categories change, we don't know what wages are like etc) and it's definitely worth noting that the cost of housing does not include, mortgages, council tax etc.

No, it isn't.

Freedom of speech is freedom from Government interference or prevention of your ability to speak, no one else.

Ordinary people do not have to put up with or listen to you. They can shout you down or get your right to a platform removed (unless you're at Speaker's Corner, where your right to a platform cannot be removed by the authorities).

There is a saying, ""[I disagree with what you are saying but I defend your right to say it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Beatrice_Hall)"" which is taken as a defence of [freedom of speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech). 

It means that I agree that you should be able to say something but it doesn't mean I have to agree with what you're saying. If you want to say something then feel free to say it, I don't care. If I don't like what you say I won't listen to you but I would still think you had the right to say something.

There are limits, though. If something you say causes harm to me or to others, then you aren't allowed to say it {the famous example [falsely shout ""Fire!"" in a theatre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater)}. In other words, there are consequences to freedom of speech.

I agree that the UK takes it to extremes but that still doesn't mean that individual people should be expected to tolerate threats of violence or to alter their life style to avoid such threats.

","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, it means freedom from consequence for what you say... That&amp;#39;s like the definition of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it isn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

Something to be careful of is that computer *programming*, which is a major focus of most degree-level computer science courses (and is a moderate focus in all such courses) has characteristics that mean that some people just don't ""get it"" within the time frame available, and either drop out or transfer to related courses (e.g. Business IT). I'd highly recommend that you consider all of the options - are there more-specific courses that'll get you into the field you're looking for? - and if you do decide you want to do a CS degree (and speaking as a graduate of one, it can be awesome), try to learn a bit of programming *beforehand*.

 I would not link the riots as the sole cause of the FTSE 100 dipping or GDP dipping, I would link that far more to cuts going a quicker pace, as we can see Americas GDP also dipped but there were no riots there. Frances GDP grew and they are a part of the Eurozone.

I don't think you picked up that I was referring to the past 12 months where there are obvious reasons for consumer confidence to have grown. So I'll leave it be.

I think for the whole oscillatory response you could have just said the boom and bust cycle and left it there. Just because it's expected doesn't mean it's the best available solution. You could argue it weeds out weaker companies and we all benefit because only the stronger firms survive leading only the most competitive companies left.... however the banks still standing would be seem to indicicate that isn't true.

The problem is by inflating the currency and making the banks money worth less and buying up easy assets making the banks take on more risky investments is that it isn't just the banks sitting on money. It's also everyone who has ever saved up money for retirement, most peoples retirement funds are sitting in bank accounts being inflated away with to much QE. Sure it's a good way to increase investment.. at the cost of everyones money.

""I guess to me it appears they've done a 3 out of 5. Not bad, certainly not good. Compared to many of the actions of the out-going labour party, comparing us against our peers who were in the same state, we've not done that badly at all.""

What peer would that be? it certainly wouldn't be any Eurozone member, America went about QE as well and have their own central bank... yet their performance over the past several years has been far better than ours. They also cut interest rates.

That was their plan, labours plan was much slower.

Your age won't count against you. If anything, it will count in your favour. I'd rather hire adults with real life experience than flighty children straight out of university. Some of the best people I've worked with in computing have done ""proper jobs"" that got their hands dirty before switching industries.

Now, having said all that, here's the downer. I mentioned experience above because it *really* matters. I don't think that there are any university courses that can teach people to think the right way to work well in computing, and especially to think the right way under pressure. CS courses do an especially bad job of it, perhaps because they assume that you've already got that because you're interested in the subject matter. Given that I can't tell from your degree that you've got what it takes, that's why experience matters so much.

Thankfully, there are two ways around this. First of all, if you want a job in programming, then you can teach yourself and build up a portfolio of your own open source work and of collaborative work on others' projects. Second, if you'd rather get into the operations side of things, then there's a route in via customer support. Unfortunately that will involve working in a call centre for a bit, which is just plain nasty, but if you're really good at it and you are lucky enough to pick an enlightened employer then they will promote from within.

Ordinary people do not have to put up with or listen to you. They can shout you down 

Completely agree mate. 


&gt;or get your right to a platform removed.

Not if that involves government interference or prevention to stop their ability to speak, like you said. 


&gt;It means that I agree that you should be able to say something but it doesn't mean I have to agree with what you're saying. If you want to say something then feel free to say it, I don't care. If I don't like what you say I won't listen to you but I would still think you had the right to say something.

Again, completely agree.



&gt;There are limits, though.


There is no limit on free speech. Otherwise it isn't free speech. I recommend reading/watching Noam Chomsky on freedom of speech, he will tell you the same. 


Ever heard the saying 'sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me', the point is that words cannot actually hurt you, if they do hurt you, that's on you. What they said didn't actually harm you.


&gt;If something you say causes harm to me or to others,

Nothing anyone can say can actually cause actual harm to people unless you let it. 

If you go down the road of punishing people for ""causing harm by words"" where do you stop? What is the scale of offensiveness or ""harm"" that you draw the line and deem it illegal?

People get offended by different things, there are people that want comedians put in jail for making jokes.


&gt; then you aren't allowed to say it {the famous example falsely shout ""Fire!"" in a theatre[3] }. In other words, there are consequences to freedom of speech.

This is an important thing that I'd like to talk about, this ruling to me is what makes the girl who tweeted that she was going to blow up an airport not protected under free speech, it's a very relatable example.

I don't believe however that sending a death threat to an individual is anything like this ruling.

Here's a quote from the original ruling

&gt;The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.

I'm aware of the differences between the two, and did acknowledge them in my post. Though still they are more complex than you are making out. Some local authorities are administrative regions, literally just lines drawn on a map for the purposes of governing a small area. Others exist using culturally distinct regions as a basis, with their own identity stemming back years. The shetland islands, for example, are a local government area within Scotland and were represented as such in the referendum results. They are also distinct entities in their own right outside of local governance, with their own history dating back centuries, their own flag, a unique culture compared to the rest of Scotland (with more influence from their nordic neighbours) and even some remnants of their own legal system. They are a distinct entity compared to the rest of Scotland in the same way that Scotland is distinct compared to the rest of the UK.

Conversely with the home nations, you say they have ""different legal, educational and legislative systems and institutions to deal with almost all aspects of life"", and here this isn't the case across the board. England, as a home nation, has none of these to its own, many are shared with Wales, some more with Northern Ireland, and none are accountable to a government that specifically represents England as one of the home nations. And among the other three that do have devolved powers, there are variations. Wales has its own legal jurisdiction to a limited extent and does not have many of the powers that the other two have, while Northern Ireland has autonomy in areas that Scotland and Wales don't, such as driver and vehicle licensing. But I don't agree that any of them can be described as quasi-sovereignties. None of them have any sovereignty whatsoever, all of that rests with the british parliament and ultimately the crown. If we became a federation then that would necessitate writing their powers into law granting them sovereignty in certain areas, with the british state ceasing to have absolute sovereignty, having ceded some of that to the federal subjects.

Anyway, back on point, the reason I made that analogy is that their argument seems to be ""why should we be subject to a change that we didn't vote for"". The reason I brought up local authorities is that, although they only have limited powers of self governance, they are all distinct parts of Scotland, with their own distinct populations. Scotland isn't one homogeneous nation. Any part of Scotland (whether that part is a local authority, a town, an ancient kingdom, whatever) has its own local culture and history, its own economy and industry, its own population with its own demographic make-up, and so forth. All of these factors can add up to create a case where any part of Scotland could say ""This political change (independence for example) will be bad for us and we don't want it, so why should we be forced to have it because other parts of scotland voted for it?"". The lack of a legal jurisdiction, education system, etc doesn't neutralise their claim that they're a unique entity who would be affected by the change in a way that nobody else would.

Conversely, I don't see any reason why just the very existence of different political and legal systems between the four home nations makes them intrinsically different to each other, such that they deserve their own voices on every matter. I can see these difference mattering in certain circumstances, such as if the british government tried to pass some major political change that was very much incompatible with scots law and would cause Scotland a lot of issues. But in general I don't think it's that significant, and I certainly don't see how it's significant in the case of EU membership. Perhaps there is a case to be made for what Leanne Wood is asking, one that considers the consequences in the context of the political differences between the parts of britain and justifies why one part should not be forced into a change against its will (ie, explains why doing so would be bad). It's not good enough to argue ""we're different"".

I hate to break this to you but Sunni tribe where ISIS recruits aren't fighting the Shia's because of a book, if it were as simple as that then this war would have been going on constantly for twelve centuries wherever Sunni and Shia meet. Our media brands them as ""religious extremists"" because it's a better sell than ""the army fighting the ethnically-pure Sunni government &amp; army we put in power who didn't like the way that the Sunni government brutalized them. Particularly following that Saddam chap who had previously brutalized the Shias for decades, creating a huge thirst for revenge"". Doesn't quite roll off the tongue. 

I'm not justifying their brutality, simply pointing out that this has a lot more to it than ""because of Islam"". We just like to say that because it sells our current foreign policies to a public that was wary of it's original branding of ""Iraqi insurgency"". It also absolves us of accepting blame for the situation created by our de-Baathication policy in Iraq, a process where we gave the Sunni ethnicity complete authority over 1/5th minority Shia regions following historically repression at the hands of the super-power backed minority. This is the single biggest cause of the insurgency yet we choose to brand it as ""extremism"". There are strong parallels to The Troubles in Northern Ireland where we essentially banned Catholics from government, leading to widespread support for their paramilitaries.

They are indeed showing disapproval, but look a bit deeper at what this group is saying, and they strongly hint that they want the law to change to prohibit ""insults"" against their prophet.

One of their signs says, ""[Absolute freedom of speech - no such thing](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/08/2577F14B00000578-2944946-Men_and_women_were_kept_separate_during_the_protest_out_of_respe-a-24_1423433935399.jpg)"". What kind of speech are they referring to, exactly? It's pretty clear what they mean.

In addition, have a look at their page on ""[Freedom of Speech](http://www.muslimactionforum.com/freedom_of_speech.php)"": they are strangely enthusiastic to list all the existing laws which limit speech.

Even more disturbing, actually, is their reference to the Pope's recent ill-advised comment, ""[Insult my mum and I will punch you](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/08/25782FF900000578-2944946-A_young_boy_was_among_those_carrying_placards_saying_Insult_My_M-a-25_1423433941837.jpg)"". In this context, it's hard not to view this, at best, as an excuse for retaliatory violence. At worst, it's a threat.

I was talking about SEIS, which I feel always has to be done in the context of EIS.  SEIS didn't start until 2012 iirc.

&gt; I would not link the riots as the sole cause of the FTSE 100 dipping or GDP dipping,

I've been trying to not attribute single causes, as that is erroneous really, but they definitely had a big effect, hence my suggestion it was a spark, almost in a tinderbox as the US types say.

&gt; You could argue it weeds out weaker companies and we all benefit because only the stronger firms survive leading only the most competitive companies left.... however the banks still standing would be seem to indicate that isn't true.

I'm saying there isn't really always a perfect response for a 'system'.  A critically damped system will not oscillate, but may never converge to an optimum state.

&gt; Sure it's a good way to increase investment.. at the cost of everyones money.

Which is my point, QE is robbing everyone who is 'long' anything that isn't outperforming (ie alpha).  This is most likely to be the richer people, as they have more savings compared to their consumption.  QE is kind of forcing lending, without directly changing rates in a first order effecting manner.

&gt; What peer would that be?

We agree picking a good peer is hard, thankfully due to us having our own monetary policy, we've been able to avoid certain things.  The US has an advantage too, inasmuch that it's got a massive domestic market, many people, myself included (and this sadly was my friday night spent simming) are worried about what will happen if there is a Greek withdrawal.  Strategically, we've spent the last 18 months making our company more dependant on APAC than EU.

&gt;""Office for Budget Responsibility forecast the structural current deficit would be eliminated by 2014-15""

At the time, I don't think anyone took it seriously, it was a lofty goal, much like labours plans.  IIRC the growth projections both people used where incredibly optimistic, in fact the labour one relied on having an upside that I don't think many thought possible, I would definitely describe it as the more optimistic and less pragmatic.

And actually, I think that against a narrow team (3-4-3, only two on the wings) who have been shaky at the back all year, our high-pressing game will be perfect. The chances that Ibe, Sterling, and Sturridge will have to get a full head of steam and run at us will be limited if press the way we did against Arsenal, and assuming the same back four, I think they can handle it. 

Moreover, I'll put Mason &amp; Bentaleb against any Liverpool midfield double-pivot, especially since Lucas won't be playing. Our FBs (Walker and Rose, most likely) have enough pace to counter the pace of Ibe &amp; Sterling, and if they can't play long diagonals (something we were great at preventing and neutralizing against Arsenal, I'll add) and they can't push the ball through middle past Mason &amp; Bentaleb, how will they attack us?

I unlike many UK watchers never bothered with the Catherine Tate Show so Doctor Who was my first introduction to her (aside from people quoting 'Am I bovered' ad infinitum around me). 

That said, Runaway Bride she was a bit... Abrasive but it was in a good way as it properly shook The Doctor up after Rose which very much became a game of 'Yes lets' towards the end of their run because they were so in sync as a pair. 

I definitely preferred her when they toned her down and brought her back to the show, she also added a much needed (and natural) comedic element with the show with Partners In Crime being one of the funniest episodes and Tennant/Tate using their combined 'stereotypes' to really play on some of the Doctor Who tropes in The Sontaran Stratagem (honestly, that 'I'm going home' scene was played so well it's a whole series highlight). 

Series 4 also had the added advantage of being really when Doctor Who was full on hype mode in the UK and it didn't have to be bogged down by companion introductions and 'it's bigger on the inside' so we got a bigger look into Donna as a character in her first episode than any other companion and as said, hype train meant more money meant more production value meant more script quality. There isn't a bad episode in Series 4, there are episodes which are average, the episodes don't hit the highs of previous series (although Midnight is one of my favourites) and there are still just as many plot holes (DALEKS DON'T HAVE HANDS, WHY WOULD THEY HAVE LEVERS). 

But it was interesting and refreshing to see a character who retained the same objectivity as The Doctor but with a different perspective, The Doctor applied cold logic under stress, Donna applied the rather paradoxical emotion logic and the combination made them an unbeatable team which to be honest hasn't been beaten since.

Who has ever been banned for criticising Judaism? If you have ever seen anti-semitism on the internet (/r/conspiracy) it is not a critique of Judaism.

Now personally I don't think that in itself should be a crime, but I think it is incredibly dishonest of you to suggest that the government is outlawing criticism of Judaism... They aren't.

Many people have been arrested for posting things which advocate violence against Muslims. Why do you think this is not the case?

Do you do much driving in a non lesson environment? This was also hugely important for me, since I was never able to learn with parents. I was limited to lessons, and I never made the transition from a learner driver to an actual driver. Try and get insured on a parents car and go driving with them.

So no conflict must ever *ever* take place in your utopian land? 

The law of the land is indeed to be followed in a *fair, equal* society. We didn't have that here. Peaceful options were met with brutal force. Which deems violent response unfortunate, but necessary to achieve said fair, equal society.


&gt; (You presumably find the fleggers similar vocabularly of ""oppression"" and ""rights"" as providing self-evident righteousness for their violence entirely non-convincing of course. 

You're comparing legitimate human rights concerns with the removal of a piece of fabric on top of a building. People being forced to flee their homes, with people not being allowed to gloat at residents of certain roads.

&gt; Howabout the Jihadis

Now your comparing victims of human rights abuses to religious supremacist and extremists. (Before you say it in your response, yes, there was sectarian elements here, but that is an inevitability when you have a class system based on sect and a conflict in the same province - and it was far from the point of the conflict).

I'm conflicted on this one. I support their right to self determination (the vast majority of Donetsk civilians do indeed wish to distance themselves from Ukraine - either via the form of an autonomous region, or by being annexed by Russia). I don't necessarily deem their method a wise one, but I don't fault them for being wary of the new Ukrainian government which arms a [Nazi inspired battalion](http://i.imgur.com/hZKJoME.jpg) to fight those in Donetsk. Before you question the authenticity of said batallion [here is an AMA with a Ukrainian](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2b72ir/iama_ukrainian_who_currently_lives_on_the/cj2irow?context=3) which verifies its authenticity.",null,0,null,1423521127,null,0,false,0,cogf889,null,t3_2uvvgv,null,t1_cogf889,null,t1_cogbpwg,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

One takeaway for me: HarriKane's goal conversion % is very high, among the elite players. Given the small sample size we have to work with, I feel this either means we will see some measure of regression in the upcoming months/seasons, or he will continue his impressive trend and cement himself as one of the best in the PL.

The reason why I believe the latter explanation is that Kane is so versatile - scoring and creating chances from any position in the attacking third, as the article describes.

There are such a multitude of variations of PR that to say that you support FPTP because you like the idea of elected representatives simply doesn't cut it. Take AMS in Scotland, for example.

You still use FPTP to directly elect your Constituency MSP's, whilst simultaneously reaping the benefits of a more representative, fairer system.

How can denounce single-issue politics and be happy with the status quo? As we currently are, the single issue being voted on isn't even a policy. It's simply that you don't want the only other party with a hope of being elected from being elected. We deserve better.

&gt;I hate to go there, but nothing on the scale of the holocaust has happened in a Muslim country: that happened in a developed, post enlightenment, European country.

Yes, the Holocaust was awful, perhaps uniquely so, but in order to judge these things it's not enough to focus on individual tragedies, no matter how great they are.  You have to assemble a long term statistical view over many nations, over long periods of time.  And when you do so, [as Pinker](http://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature) and others have shown, you find out that contrary to all expectations, violence really is undergoing a dramatic decline.  A decline which needs an explanation.  And the Enlightenment appears to be part of that explanation.

&gt;And since you brought up beheading, it's worth noting that the French were carrying out public guillotining in living memory.

Again - you're not behaving like a statistician.  Yes, of course you can find terrible violence in recent times in Western nations.  Nobody is saying that the Enlightenment put a stop to all violence!  But you have to take a more encompassing view - looking at statistical trends across different nations and different time periods.

Now, you can question the non-existence (or existence) of God all you want (as you have the right to), but he *believes* that God exists.

I fully agree with u here, but

Imo religion itself can't hurt people. People hurt people. If someone kills or does harm in the name of a religion, then it's the person's fault, not the religion's fault.

I disagree from the first point and I have presented my reasoning as to why. Obviously, a nation is a tricky concept and systems and institutions need nott define one but there are many cases to argue that Shetland isn't a nation. For one it has been part of the crown of Scotland since 1471 (having previously belonged to Norway since ~1194)  thus not being independent for about a millenium and for another I don't think the islanders themselves consider Shetland a nation (imo), even though Shetland has its own distinct identity. 

This is obviously not the case for England, Wales and Scotland which have very well defined historical and societal identities as countries. In that sense it is disingenuous to compare the relationship of Shetland to Scotland and that of Scotland to the UK. 

Likewise if you said ""[Yorkshire is] a distinct entity compared to the rest of [England] in the same way that [England] is distinct compared to the rest of the UK"" I don't think that would be a fair comparrison at all. Yorkshire has its own history and identity but it does not follow that you can equate the relationship of Yorkshire to England and the relationship of England to the UK just because they are constituent parts of one another. Thus, I think you are comparing two different things.

Whether the home nations should have veto power is a distinct but related issue. The paradox is that if only the English vote to leave then that is unfair on the Scots, Welsh and NIish. But if the latter veto then that is unfair on the English. 

To me both are unnacceptable. However, we need only to look at Denmark and Greenland to see that a compromise can be reached so I think the debate is a false dichotomy. The nations should have a right to determine their constitutionality (hence indyref &amp; devo). This would require some majour work and compromise but it could be done - its impact would be a truly federal United Kingdom. 

If you don't want that then you either have a dominating England constantly highjacking the British parliament or a leashed England that is constrained by its desire to keep a united country and hence cannot satisfy the opinions of its own electorate.

If the creative players or strikers don't create chances, how is Allen the one to blame for that? Of course he won't fucking have a big impact if his outlets aren't doing anything with the ball. 

I don't think he's a Lucas replacement because that's not his game, but he's not a bad player, there's a lot of ignorance in here sometimes. ",null,0,null,1423522419,null,0,false,0,cogg02y,null,t3_2vai6u,null,t1_cogg02y,null,t1_cofws12,null,null,null,null,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

I wish my mum gave that much of a shit about my journey to school when I was a child.  She was too busy juggling night shifts, looking after my younger sisters and making my dinners whilst she went without to take me the short distance to school.  

The whole making mums into ""goddesses"" annoys the shit out of me.  My girlfriends sister was recently evicted, along with her 12 year old daughter, because she had been spending her rent on fancy meals and trips to London with her new boyfriend.  She is unemployed and on housing benefit, of course.

This particular ""mother"" is now living in a box room in her parents house, sleeping in a bunk bed with her 12 year old daughter.  She is talking about marrying her boyfriend, and having more kids.  Honestly, I think the only reason she wants another child is so she has an excuse to sit on her arse for another 12 years.  

It's a compelling story to watch from the outside, but her selfishness is causing massive upset to everyone around her.  Does she not think that her 12 year old daughter will remember the time they got evicted from their home? 

If it wasn't for her family supporting her, especially now they're homeless, her kid would have been taken into care.  She truly is an unfit mother, a fucking useless person.  And she wants to have another baby?  lol.  

So yeah, I guess ""as a mother"" you might have certain opinions and concerns, but that doesn't mean you aren't a terrible parent.  The only thing my 12 year old niece eats is fish fingers, canned spaghetti hoops and oven chips.  The whole situation makes me feel  sad for the girl.

The mum, my girlfriends sister, can go fuck herself.  What kind of parent willingly gets evicted (long story, she brought it on herself) when they have a pre-teen kid to apparently look after.  Poor girl will remember this for the rest of her life... that her mum is a fuck up.

She pretends to be a parent, for instance, she wouldn't let her daughter in my car until she had been for a drive with me.  Because she's obviously more qualified than the examiner who passed me.  Ugh.  As a reasonable adult, I fucking hate that particular mother.

Even though they were fellow Yids, both asserted that we would never have to endure the pain of seeing him move to Madrid, because he'd never be *that* good, and I had to disagree. By no means is he there yet, and it's not like I'm even convinced enough yet to be arguing his case, but there really is no reason that he can't be IMHO.

1 As I've mentioned in a comment elsewhere on this page, Kane's been scoring against anyone put in front of him since late last season and beyond. He scored on his first league start for us last year (and in the next two games as well), and before he got into the first team this season he scored in every cup and Europa game that he played in except one (goalless draw v Partizan). The reason that he hasn't looked that good before fairly recently is because, er.... he's 21 years old. Both Michu and Beattie were a bit older and just hit some patches of form, while Benteke hasn't quite lived up to his promise but he's young too and I'd still take a chance on him at Spurs.

2-4 are hypotheticals, I mean fair comment but only time will tell and they sure as hell don't disprove his potential.

5 While he's not the quickest, he's fast enough to be effective and he's versatile enough for pace to not have to be a part of his game. Also I think his technique is quite underrated - he scores a wide variety of goals (with his head, both feet, long and short range) and is very good with the ball at his feet (like a clumsy Dembele).

null,false,Jimmybob123,null,null,null,"It may not be the best as it likely means that Allen or Gerrard will replace Lucas in the double pivot as if Can is still in defense we're probably still going with a back three. 

It's a situation where Rodgers honestly can't really win. For me, he had three options:

* 1- Move Can to midfield and bring Lovren/Kolo in to fill up the gap. The positive to this is that if it works, then it helps with integrating Lovren, someone Brendan reportedly still sees as our long term CB, back in to the side. I'm also quite positive that Can would do a better job than Allen or Gerrard. Sadly this option also has its downsides, being that it is extremely risky and if Lovren doesn't cope in the back three well then it is bound to be a disaster.

High reward- high risk.

* 2- Change the system. Another option Rodgers had is to change the system from a back three to perhaps a 442 diamond with Sturridge and someone else up top and Henderson/Can as the single pivot with Coutino, Lallana,Can, Henderson or sterling making the midfield three and Ibe, Markovic, Borini or Sterling out side.While this would be fantastic if it worked for me Henderson is massively wasted as a sole DM for me and operates best in central midfield, and Can would be quite experimental. Our current system is also working very well and it wouldn't make much sense to change it.

Good reward- High risk

* 3- The third option is the one it looks like Brendan has gone for: keep it the same. This means that Can will remain in defense with Skrtel and Sakho while I assume Allen or Gerrard will replace Lucas in the double pivot. This may keep the structure of the team the same however Gerrard simply doesn't have the legs for the role anymore and Allen is best suited slightly higher up the pitch pressing people and closing spaces; he's too weak for blocking them off and shielding the defense. In the end this was always the sensible option as when a system is working well for a team it is important not to tinker with it too much, something that in the past I'd say Rodgers has been guilty of which is why I'm quite relieved he has went for the safest option.

Medium reward- Medium risk

I think at the end of the day there was no perfect option for this situation which further backs up the point that we still need an additional DM, hopefully Can can do this role in the future.

well that's what i generally think when i hear you and copyright lawyers moaning about a fringe behaviour that doesn't cause any significant harm or even much worry to the content creators themselves (it may well actually benefit them), just leaves the bean counters, lawyers and 'management' in a tizzy. the net has changed the game, it makes them unnecessary to the content creators, it denies them the opportunity to profit from assaulting our senses with advertising for their other shitty products, that is why they want it suffocated. art designed for profit can die a painful death for all i care.

i don't think illegal downloading is morally right however the steps and tactics taken to curb it, are the far greater crime. i do not regard it the same as theft, it is its own separate thing. taking a picture of a sandwich doesn't mean you stole a sandwich, especially when that sandwich is designed to leave you with indigestion.

unsanctioned copying doesn't take place in a vacuum. as soon as netflix or spotify is available in a country, torrenting takes a nosedive. the old system of distribution exploited the content creators and the public, where they haven't adapted to technology, answered the legitimate concerns of the customer and tempered their own greed, they can expect to get fucked over.

Parents (mothers mainly) would go back to work sooner, doing longer hours. This means more in tax. It would also of course provide more jobs in childcare, so lower unemployment.

Why not balance it when we can afford to, it's been shown repeatedly that Austerity always extends recessions, at best shallowing out a recovery into a long one at worse causing double and triple dips. It makes more sense to grow the British economy, while limiting growth of the budget, measures like this not only achieve that but also help level out the inequality which is linked to many social and economic issues.

The UK economy has been growing at a decent clip for a while now and we're almost at full employment. Even if you are a Keynesian, we're getting to the point when you're supposed to not just be running a balanced budget, but saving for a rainy day.

No. Both sides are equally bad. Did you miss all of the torture/mutilation stories from our guys? Did you comprehend the scope of our bombing campaigns? 

I don't have a problem with a ""just war"" (e.g. Falklands) but very few of ours are. We mostly fight for control of other nations. Dick move. 

&gt;  Do you really see no difference between Islamist fascists

Perhaps, if that's what they were. The situation in Iraq is complicated but mostly boils down to the Sunni/Shia divide. The minority Shia's had full control of the country under Saddam and lets just say ""they made a few enemies"". At this time they were pretty much secular, booze was legal etc. Hardly any trace of what you call ""Islamic fascism"". 

Then we invaded Iraq for the 4th time in 100 years and put yet a new government in place, this time Sunni. We literally banned all Shias from taking *any* government role, from politicians right down to teachers and accountants. This meant a flood of Sunni's taking control of localities they frankly hated because of Saddam and as you might expect they were pretty brutal and eventually became unwelcome. Imagine if we were to ban Catholics from taking part in government service in Northern Ireland, replacing every Catholic school teacher with one from a Presbyterian background. How well would that go down? Hence the quick retreat of the new Iraqi army back to it's Sunni homeland when the shit hit the fan, in most ways they had been operating like an occupying force. Being our allies our media never covered this nor did they cover their civilian casualties, mass arrests &amp; torture. 

This is why ISIS has so much support on the ground, they could not operate without it. It's not religiously driven, like all terrorist or insurgent groups they have an ultimate political goal. 

tl;dr: Iraq needs to be partitioned, with Sunni/Shai areas having similar autonomy to what the Kurds have. Note that the Kurds and Sunni's aren't fighting each other and that the central Sunni government gave them their autonomy.

As for a title challenge, it largely depends on whether players like Kane and Bentaleb and Eriksen and Mason continue to develop, whether Lamela fully comes good, what Dier's ceiling is, and whether Lloris and Vertonghen stay.

In two years' time, the spine of Kane - Eriksen - Bentaleb - Vertonghen/Dier - Lloris could become arguably the strongest central spine in the league.  Who we put around them, and who we have for depth, will make the difference between being equal to Chelsea and City, or continuing to fight with Arsenal over the 4th/5th spots.

If, in two years, a 24-year-old Lamela has put it together, gotten his decision-making straight, and polished his prodigious talent, then I'd happily put him and Chadli against any starting wing pair in the league.  Who knows?  Maybe we'll have Depay in the mix as well.

Bentaleb is going to be a monster at CM.  What if we finally end up getting Schneiderlin?  (And let's not forget, Mason is only 23 -- what will he look like when he's 25?)

Lots of what ifs, but they're not unreasonable.  To me, the core is there, and in two years we could well have an unbelievably good team.

Post WW2 violence has seen a fairly massive decline sure, but before that violence was at ridiculous levels throughout the world. I mean in the West we had two wars that killed 40 million people in 20 years, before that we had years of almost constant warfare between various European states. Starting with the napoleonic wars (which arguably ideas of enlightenment were a major cause of the revolution and following wars) and leading to the precursor of WW1 the Franco-Prussian wars. What likely caused the huge decline was not the enlightenment but two alliances that were committed to mutually destroying each other after the deadliest war in human history. 

You note Pinker's analysis which is amusing. Firstly he's not an historian, he's a psychologist. Secondly his book is packed full of bad history, dodgy statistics and poor conclusions. 

He makes incredibly basic errors including lamenting brutal torture devices that never existed (iron maiden), quoting Das Mittelalterliche Hasbury as a source about violence in medieval life ignoring the fact it's actually an allegory for Mars and Saturn, hugely exaggerating deaths in pre-modern conflicts (the an lushan rebellion did not kill 36 million and the only way to get that number is by replying on a census that assumed everybody not on the roll had died in the rebellion which is just silly) and probably the worst of all he never actually defines what he means by peaceful and violent. Real historians just don't use loaded words like to describe vast amounts of human history without referring to the contemporary social and cultural background. Real historians don't compare deaths counts between WW2 (which lasted 5 years) and the West African slave trade which lasted about 300 years.
