&gt; Take Germany, for example. In 2011, the German government settled an ISDS case with Swedish energy company Vattenfall, which launched a 1.4 billion euro claim against the government for strict restrictions that were imposed on a coal-fired power plant it was planning to build on the banks of the River Elbe. To settle the case, the German government had to agree to withdraw the restrictions. Now Germany is facing another ISDS claim from the same energy company, this time against the decision to wind back nuclear power after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.

&gt; Philip Morris is arguing that Australia's tobacco plain packaging measure constitutes an expropriation of its Australian investments in breach of Article 6 of the Hong Kong Agreement. Philip Morris Asia further argues that Australia's tobacco plain packaging measure is in breach of its commitment under Article 2(2) of the Hong Kong Agreement to accord fair and equitable treatment to Philip Morris Asia's investments.

I'm sorry but corporations clearly can't be trusted with this sort of power. Even if they *lose* these cases (under NAFTA US companies have never lost an ISDS case) they are costing governments enormous amounts of money just to defend their protection of citizens.

**ETHYL CORP V. CANADA**.

Here's what the NGO you linked to said.

&gt;Ethyl, a U.S. chemical company, launched an
investor-state case over the Canadian ban of
MMT, a toxic gasoline additive used to improve
engine performance. MMT contains manganese −
a known human neurotoxin. Canadian legislators,
concerned about the public health and
environmental risk of MMT emissions, and about
MMT’s interference with emission-control
systems, banned MMT’s transport and import in
1997, despite Ethyl’s explicit threat that it would
respond with a NAFTA challenge. MMT is not
used in most countries outside Canada, and is
banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in reformulated gasoline. Making good on
its threat, Ethyl initiated a NAFTA claim against
the toxics ban, arguing that it constituted a
NAFTA-forbidden indirect expropriation of its
assets.

&gt;Though Canada argued that Ethyl did not have standing under NAFTA to bring the challenge, a NAFTA tribunal rejected Canada’s objections in a June 1998 jurisdictional decision that paved the
way for a ruling on the substance of the case.
Less than a month after losing the jurisdictional
ruling, the Canadian government announced that
it would settle with Ethyl. The terms of that
settlement required the government to pay the
firm $13 million in damages and legal fees, post
advertising saying MMT was safe and reverse the
ban on MMT.
10 Today Canada depends largely on
voluntary restrictions to reduce the presence of
MMT in gasoline

This is a massive massive massive misrepresentation of what happened, heavily skewed to a certain viewpoint. Let's look at what actually happened.

Pretty much all successful ISDS cases are when the government takes political decisions which disproportionately disfavour foreign companies. Ehtyl Corp V Canada was one of the early NAFTA ISDS cases, where Canada banned a fuel additive that was only used by one company (foreign) called Ethyl Corp on the basis of health reasons. Ethyl Corp sued, saying the additive was actually banned for political reasons rather than on any scientific grounds, and the Canadian government chose to settle - paying them some $20 million dollars and withdrawing the law they were implementing.

On the face of it, it seems like Ethyl Corp was the bad guy and the Canadian government was pursuing legitimate policy in the public interest, and this is certainly how it was played out in the media. In actual fact, [Ethyl Corp presented the Canadian governments own documents](http://www.economia-snci.gob.mx/sic_php/pages/importa/sol_contro/consultoria/Casos_canada/Ethyl/971002_Statement_of_Claim.pdf) (p.4 onwards), coming from the Health and Environmental departments, dating to about a year prior that unequivocally stated that there was absolutely zero danger from using the additive in fuel. In fact, the party that tried to get the law through had had strong historical links with the domestic companies competing with Ethyl Corp.

In all the papers, it was portrayed as 'Company sues government over environmental protections/health protections', and that's how all ISDS cases get presented in mainstream newspapers. 'Company screwing with our laws' sells way more papers than 'company disputes unfair government policies', I guess. I don't know about you, but I don't think it's fair that foreign investors should be unfairly discriminated against in this way. ISDS prevents political parties from favouring their contributors over foreigners by enacting biased laws such as these. Why should Joe Public lose out because one of the parties is trying to cozy up to their largest donors, and why is it fair that international investors get screwed just because they're foreigners? In actual fact, ISDS is a great way of keeping governments accountable by limiting the political favours they can hand out whilst in office.

**ELI LILLY V. CANADA** 

Here's what the NGO you linked to said.

&gt;Indiana-based Eli Lilly, the fifth-largest U.S.
pharmaceutical corporation, challenged Canada’s
patent standards after Canadian courts
invalidated the company’s patents for Strattera
and Zyprexa, drugs used to treat attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder. Canadian federal courts ruled
that Eli Lilly had failed to demonstrate or soundly
predict that the drugs would provide the benefits
that the company promised when applying for the
patents’ monopoly protection rights. The resulting
invalidations of the patents paved the way for
Canadian drug producers to produce less
expensive, generic versions of the drugs. Eli
Lilly’s notice argued that Canada’s entire legal
basis for determining a patent’s validity – that a
pharmaceutical corporation should be required to
verify its promises of a drug’s utility in order to
obtain a patent – is “arbitrary, unfair, unjust, and
discriminatory.” The company alleged that
Canada’s legal standard violated the NAFTA
guarantee of a “minimum standard of treatment”
for foreign investors and resulted in a NAFTAprohibited
expropriation

[Here](http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/assets/pdfs/disp-diff/eli-01.pdf) is the original submission of the company when they decided to initiate ISDS proceedings. They sued because Canada changed the standard for how they implement medical patents to one that is incompatible with that of NAFTA. From the document, p. 11, paragraph 41;

&gt;In the years since AZT was decided by the Supreme Court of Canada, the Federal Courts departed from the approach in AZT in two respects: (a) by measuring utility not against the invention as claimed, but as against the ""promises of the patent"" that the courts find are either explicitly stated or implied in the patent disclosure; and (b) elevating the quantum of data needed to demonstrate or soundly predict usefulness, to such a degree that even human clinical data in patients may not be adequate. Notably, the ""promise doctrine"" can lead to the absurd result of a clearly useful invention (approved as safe and 
effective by Health Canada) being held invalid for not being ""useful"". 

If you read through the entirety, they have a completely reasonable case, and the slant that Public Citizen took is just flat out biased as fuck. 

**LONE PINE RESOURCES INC V. CANADA**

Here's what the NGO said:

&gt;Lone Pine Resources, a U.S.-based corporation,
challenged Quebec’s moratorium on the
controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, for natural gas. The provincial
government declared the moratorium in 2011 so
as to conduct an environmental impact
assessment of the extraction method widely
accused of leaching chemicals and gases into
groundwater and the air. Lone Pine Resources, a
Delaware-headquartered gas and oil exploration
and production company, had plans and permits
to engage in fracking on over 30,000 acres of
land directly beneath the St. Lawrence River.
Lone Pine argued that the fracking moratorium
nullified those permits. According to Lone Pine,
such policymaking contravened NAFTA’s
protections against expropriation and for “fair and
equitable treatment.”

I've covered this one too, and have argued about it a bunch of times, but this time I'm just going to link you to the analysis of another user that shows how this is just a populist as fuck way to explain what happened.

&gt;[ Lone Pine is actually suing for compensation for Quebec's cancellation of their exploration permits, which was done as part of the moratorium. It costs a good deal of money to get exploration permits, and the cancellation seems somewhat dubious - the Quebec moratorium is to study whether fracking is dangerous, and cancelling permits before that's even been shown seems dubious and probably done as a crowd-pleaser. Since the company invested money when the permits were entirely acceptable to the Quebec government, why should they not ask for some compensation because the government has changed its mind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/europeanparliament/comments/2zxsic/ttip/cporfls)

Ah, companies can have no ulterior motives then. Even though you admit that Philip morris was using ISDS to cost Australia money and time in order to stop other national governments from adversely effecting their profits.

i.e. they are suing for lost profits.

&gt; (the implication being that a company just has to show it has been adversely affected by government regulations, and hence is entitled to compensation)

That is not the implication at all. The implication is that ISDS can be abused by companies (as you have admitted yourself in the post you linked as ""proof"") to cost national governments money and time to dissuade them from enacting policies that protect their citizens. I even said this in my previous post.

&gt; Regardless I don't think they even intend to win - rather, whilst Australia is bogged down in negotiations, other countries will refrain from implementing plain packaging themselves (Ireland, for example, appears to be waiting on the verdict before implementing their version of the law).

Not really. The idea that the SNP desire hatred within the union is nonsense. A second referendum quickly would also be lost and would properly kill any hopes of another in the near future. 

I've said it elsewhere, the SNP have all the hatred of Westminster they could possibly want in the electorate. It's not enough, they need more legitimacy for themselves and for Holyrood. Get powers, use powers, nice and easy does it. Fostering animosity doesn't give them that. It's far more likely they'll do the opposite, advocate for UK changes/positions that are right on the line of possibility for Labour to make them look insipid, force them to adopt something that appears more ambitious (which will happen to include some radical change for how devolution works)

If Labour go with it then *yay* SNP are a force for good in Westminster. If they don't then *boo* Labour don't have a backbone.

Salmond right now is trying to make Labour take a swing at the SNP because he knows there's an ~80% chance it'll just come across like an attack on the Scottish electorate. He's been doing this to Scottish Labour for nearly a decade now, they hate the SNP so much they can't help but lash out every chance they get.

Similarly, you can't sue me for lost profits if I call you a pedofile, you could only sue me for libel and request financial compensation for the lost profits my libel caused you.

&gt;The implication is that ISDS can be abused by companies (as you have admitted yourself in the post you linked as ""proof"") to cost national governments money and time to dissuade them from enacting policies that protect their citizens.

This didn't dissuade Australia. The UK is currently going through with it as well, despite the Australian case not finished yet. Ireland is coming shortly behind as well.

&gt;This is exactly the sort of thing I'm talking about. You are actually in favour of allowing this to happen...

This is the cost inherent in any legal system, people sue for all kinds of frivolous reasons, or in pursuit of an outcome unrelated to justice. We don't say ""well, the justice system doesn't work, better give up and start clobbering people we don't like over the head"". We instead accept we don't live in a utopia, but rather in a system filled with human flaws, and go on from there.

Fortunately, the EU in it's infinite wisdom has already greatly tightened up ISDS provisions in CETA, which serves as a springboard for TTIP ISDS rules which serve to prevent such abuses in the future. The EU has already suggested a [much greater degree of transparency](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/november/tradoc_151916.pdf) as well as other reforms that aim to prevent corporate abuse of ISDS, such as frivolous or long-shot claims.

That same space program has made telecommunication in India ""good"". It has helped bring phones to those same slums. You can buy a functioning smart phone here for 50 quid. For many it's the gateway to the Internet. 

Have you actually been to India? Only 30% of the country live in cities. The issue is that it is like a pre-industrial revolution UK where the majority of the population lives in the countryside and with increasing amounts of migration from the countryside to the city resulting in slums like Industrial Revolution UK and indeed most of Europe. History Repeats itself if you will. 

The reason for offering aid is so that India does not have to have the same level of abuse and ecological damage as the Industrial Revolution caused and instead jump a few steps ahead. Remember in the 1940s large parts of the USA still had outdoor pit toilets with sewage only becoming universal in the 50s and 60s. And there are slums in the USA, does that mean the USA should tear down NASA until it solves the housing projects? That kind of logic is silly.

I actually work IN this field. It's an easy thing to say. Digging bore holes is a temporary solution and no one is sending clean water to Africa from Europe. What people are sending is chlorination plants and clean drinking technologies.

You can setup a regular monthly investment into something like Vanguards LifeStrategy X% (Acc) where a higher X generally means higher risk. I think there's 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100. These have an AMC of 0.24%.

You shouldn't need to really do anything after setting it up, other than come back to it in a few years and see how it's doing.

&gt; I'm not really an expert and although maybe a little bit more expensive, is having somebody who knows what they're doing managing the investments going to be more worthwhile?

There's a lot of debate on this, but I lean towards 'no'. Few active traders beat passive investment returns, and even if they can do so reliably, it's hard to figure out which active traders will do well ahead of time.

Because we live in countries containing legal systems, and we're free to make use of those systems if we feel we've been aggrieved? Regardless, being able to sue is not the same as winning.

You also keep throwing the word 'democratic' around, whilst ignoring that we live in *liberal-democracies* - that is, countries where the minority is protected from the tyranny of the majority.

I don't think you realise what it's like in Scotland at the height of the winter solstice, we get less than six hours of useful daylight. With the current timezone that means sunrise is just before 9am and sunset is just after 3:30 pm. Do those times sound familiar? If not, think back to your school days. Have you ever gotten to school while it's still dark? What effect do you think that will have on alertness and performance in school if it's not even light until halfway through the ""morning""?

Personally I'm pretty much on the fence on this issue but can see both sides point of view. Up in the north we get less dead kids mowed down by sleepy drivers in the dark.

You may *want* a system that allows the admins to lock it down fully and prevent users side-loading their own apps. iOS allows admins to do that (and I'm sure there are solutions for Android as well). IT has made a decision - that's the system they're best able to provision and support for their users.

Whilst MPs may have been able to express a preference on platform, it's not like this is ""MPs vote to give selves iPads"". IT have picked a platform and will be rolling it out.

At the end of the day, most people forget that the cost of the hardware is *insignificant* compared with the cost of administering it, providing support, etc.

The £100-150 difference between an iPad and an equivalent Android pad is no significance whatsoever when you count the back-end servers that run the email, local update servers, corporate app management systems, etc, etc - they will run to over £1000/user on their own.",null,0,null,1427303410,null,0,1427327309,0,cpqe9fq,null,t3_308wld,null,t1_cpqe9fq,null,t1_cpqckch,null,null,null,1432008135,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

I feel you are being deliberately contentious here, the SNP are only standing in those ~8% seats. They are set to wipe out all other parties in Scotland. Otherwise I didn't say anything about them joining a coalition.

&gt; A party like the SNP should rule Scotland, not the UK.

I made no claim they should ""rule"" the UK. I even agree that there  is room to debate whether or not the SNP should form part of a UK Government. The issue I take is with the attitude displayed by the comment that I first replied to, that like Sinn Fein MPs, SNP MPs should not take their seats in Westminster.

&gt; This is the prime reason I believe independence would be good for Scotland in the long term. Though with current oil prices, and the left wing economic policies, I'd expect Scotland would look something like Russia economically, or worse.

The Yalta conference happened before the Cold War and therefore has no implication on Stalin refusing to implement democracy. Yes the Cold War happened, but only after Stalin refused to abide by his agreements.

&gt; If you ever thought the USSR was going to give back strategic locations back to their enemies after a fucking world war where they lost 26million citizens you really are beyond delusional. 

Why? Stalin signed and ratified the treaty. What was the point in helping the soviets if they where just going to throw it back in our faces and deceive their allies. According to Kremlin bots like yourself though, Russia can do no wrong.

&gt; Because these events have nothing to do with Putin and in no way express some trend of inexorable Russian expansion.

For the last 300 years Russia has been trying to expand its borders. It is a country built upon expansionism and nationalism. Something you clearly are part of. Britain used to be similar, but we realised it is only blood thirsty savages that continue such pursuits.

&gt; And you wouldn't care about Saakashvili as he started the war with Russia by shelling a Russian garrison, but lets not bring that up right

No, he didn't start the war. Just like in Crimea, Russia used its good old Maskirovka tactics then as it is doing now in Ukraine.

&gt; doesn't fit in with your sensationalist fox news position.

I don't watch fox news either shill. Again, I watch verifiably independent media. Do you know what that means?

It means media outlets that are not connected to any political party or international media empire like Rupert Murdochs. Just as I do not watch the garbage Kremlin propaganda that you watch, I do not watch the garbage American propaganda Americans watch.

&gt; Where did I say all Ukrainians can die? Thats right I didn't.

[""No Bullshit, they literally have Nazis in their government and in their state run national guard. As such I have no sympathy for these people.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/300992/russia_has_more_right_to_crimea_than_britain_to/cpp39gk)

[""The Ukrainians should have accepted it decades ago, instead their flirtation with ultra nationalist fascism has caused the other russophone regions to break away too in revulsion at the Ukrainian government.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/300992/russia_has_more_right_to_crimea_than_britain_to/cpp39gk)

You simply believe that because Nazi's exist all Ukrainians deserve to die. Its right there. You are in favour of the Russian invasion of Eastern Ukraine and you are also in favour of the stirring of tensions.

It doesn't cross your tiny brain that these tensions where solely the creation of the Kremlin in order to take Crimea for the military port.

You need to get it through your thick skull that Nazi's exist in every country. Russia has some Nazi MP's, just like Britain has some Nazi councillors. Its not an excuse to invade and kill whoever you want.

&gt; But I cannot ignore the rights of self determination for the Crimeans and Ukrainian/Russian separatists in the seceded territories.

Yeah that's fine, I'm in favour of Crimea being part of Russia. I just disagree with the way in which the annexation was carried out. [Here's an infographic.](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2014/03/scotland_crimea/0aded2ab2.jpg)

&gt; If the Fascists insist on attempting to bring the people to heel then they will keep meeting a sticky end and I will not shed a tear for them.

Again, you refer to all Ukrainians as Fascists simply because your Kremlin propaganda told you all Ukrainians are fascists. All Ukrainians have done is defend their homeland whilst Russia invades and simply blames us.

&gt; And no they're not all Russians, or do you think it odd that the only people willing to fight in the eastern regions to keep them under control of the Ukrainian state are sent their from the west by the Ukrainian state and where swastikas?

Ah, of course. **All** of Eastern Ukraine is controlled by Nazi's. Its not that you are brainwashed by Russian propaganda. Its that the entirety of Ukraine is Nazi's, and therefore so is the entirety of the west. But wait, that means you are also a Nazi :O

Now i guess you have to kill yourself...

Such a shame :(, i will miss you.

&gt; How the fuck is it historical revisionism pointing out that the Russians were not going to abandon their historical black sea fleet HQ and port?

You said it had been under the control of Russia since the Russian empire.

I proved you were wrong, and so therefore you are a historical revisionist; and incredibly dim :).

&gt; Yes they are being sent somewhere, the Azod fascist battalion does not live in mauripol, they've been sent to the frontlines.

They've been defending Mariupol since the Russian invasion from Maksimov. You know, the massive army that that actually came from the Russian mainland. But according to the Kremlin it is clearly ""separatists"".

&gt; And now somehow Those fascists are defending themselves from savages like me? what you mean middle aged men from Hampshire?

Retards that think everyone the Kremlin tells them is a Nazi, is a Nazi.

&gt; Look I've quite enjoyed this little argument, your hearts in the right place, but I think you're a little misguided and easily led.

Same to you Putin bot. Keep watching RT and reading Sputnik and I'm sure all your Nazi conspiracy theories will come true...

Potentially. But labour concessions would probably be things like cutting Trident from 4 boats to 3... removing the bedroom tax in exchange for further welfare cuts in other areas... increasing the personal tax allowance above what the conservatives would ideally want etc.

Basically they are small-ish things. They aren't so much about radically altering the path we are on, they are about optimising it to suit their own agenda. 

The problem is the SNP are a different beast. They have to be all things to all people in Scotland. So they tend to favour radical or outlandish plans. It's easy to do that when you are in a position to not have to see those plans through. Labour and the conservatives aren't so lucky. Essentially this is the problem the Lib dems have also encountered - where now they are in power they've had to drop some of their more unrealistic proposals and adopt a more pragmatic approach to government. 

I don't think that necessarily means labour = the tories though, which is merely SNP propaganda to support their own position - since they know that labour and the conservatives will be judged by the results of their actions, whereas the SNP doesn't have that problem. The SNP can make frankly outrageous claims, on the basis that they don't have to be the ones to push them through. And indeed, if you look at their legislative agenda in Scotland it's hardly ground-breaking. They tend to be just about as socially conservative as the rest of the UK. 

The bottom line is SNP concessions would be antagonistic rather than realistic. They would concessions designed to do the maximum damage to the Westminster establishment rather than to extract the maximum gain for Scots. That's very hard to work with, because any party making concessions to the SNP would be doing so in the knowledge that those concessions are purely designed to cause damage.

The NUS tries so hard to be inclusive and non-offensive, that it ends up engaging in a zero-sum game in which nothing ever gets done.

The NUS can be quite moronic in how it handles inclusivity issues... What should have happened is that those who do suffer from clapping anxiety could put in a request that people do not clap for their presentation, and then handle that case individually. By doing a blanket ban, you end up with the silliness of ""what about the person who is triggered by rapid hand movements?"" ""What about the person who is triggered by absolute silence?"". The strawman feminist is largely a myth, but if there is anything that comes close to embodying it, it is the NUS..

It's used against them and only them because of the behaviour of their fans and with our belief that a large amount of them are violent cretins. A claim made by another poster in this thread was that Hun was used as a derogatory term against Germans as the home of protestantism...

There's a reason barbaric groups throughout history have been referred to as Huns. It's fuck all to do with being a protestant. 

Can it be said on TV? I think you're intentionally being coy. It was said by a Swedish man on Dutch TV having been asked the lyrics to his song. It wasn't an outburst or intentionally said to cause offence. He was oblivious. I doubt he knew the country he currently plays in is populated by handwringers...

0. Look at the [Help to Buy ISA](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/414027/FTB_factographic_final.pdf) that has just been launched. If the government is going to give you £3000, suggest you take it.
0. Think about the money you are saving. Do you need it in 3 years? All of it? If so, remember that the stock market fluctuates. Yes it is the best long-term investment (v. real estate, stocks, bonds, commodities, etc) but it is volatile. So if you need the money on a specific date, putting everything into the stock market is not sensible
0. If you do decide to put a % into stocks, you then have to decide if you are going to pay someone else to do it (active asset management) which comes at a cost. Or do it yourself.
0. If you do it yourself, then do you just buy an index/tracker (passive investing) and get the market returns. Or are you going to actively pick stocks.
0. If you do go the DIY route, suggest you look at [AJBell](https://www.youinvest.co.uk/) and [AllianceTrustSavings](http://www.alliancetrustsavings.co.uk/sipp-and-isa/) as options for your brokerage account. Low / no fees, good choice, excellent brands. No complications.

And if you decide to buy a tracker. Avoid Virgin Money at all cost! They charge [1.00%](http://uk.virginmoney.com/virgin/isa/ftse/more-info.jsp) for their FTSE tracker. When you can get the same via Vanguard for 0.07%. Scandalous.

2 years is a long time, especially when a case is as simple as telling a tobacco company to apply plain packaging.

&gt;  Regardless, the point is that they can't sue for lost profits. 

Are corporations unable to lie or misrepresent themselves? Just because they cannot actually say ""we are suing you for lost profits"", that doesn't mean they are unable to sue someone for the sole purpose of regaining their profits under the guise of some other charge.

&gt; This didn't dissuade Australia. The UK is currently going through with it as well, despite the Australian case not finished yet. Ireland is coming shortly behind as well.

As if the fact that 3 countries out of ~200 implementing this change is proof it had no effect.

I guess the other ~197 countries that aren't implementing this regulation are proof it had an incredibly significant effect?

&gt; This is the cost inherent in any legal system, people sue for all kinds of frivolous reasons, or in pursuit of an outcome unrelated to justice.

You are correct, there is a reason the legal system exists; luckily I am not arguing for the abolishment of the legal system just ISDS. Which companies are abusing, as you have admitted yourself. I do not know why you would defend a system that prohibits national governments from enacting policies that protect their citizens or environment simply because of lost ""investments"".

&gt; Fortunately, the EU in it's infinite wisdom has already greatly tightened up ISDS provisions in CETA, which serves as a springboard for TTIP ISDS rules which serve to prevent such abuses in the future. The EU has already suggested a much greater degree of transparency as well as other reforms that aim to prevent corporate abuse of ISDS, such as frivolous or long-shot claims. Additionally, in the last ten years both the ICSID and UNCITRAL (the two premier bodies dealing with ISDS) have implemented much broader transparency rules.

This does not matter to me. Time and again companies have proven to be untrustworthy.

Essentially they work like a reverse fridge and use a vapour compression cycle. So a really cold anti-freeze like fluid is pumped around a closed circuit under the river at something like minus 20. The river is quite warm relative to minus 20 so the fluid heats up and as it does it expands and converts to a gas. The heat pump then compresses this gas and voila it rises up to a useable 40-50 degrees.

These pumps require electricity hence them not being carbon free. However, you're receiving extra 'free' heat so that makes the electricity 200-400% efficient.  

The interest in using these is that we will eventually have to look at ways of moving our heating systems on to electricity as we can generate electricity in lots of low carbon ways. Natural gas, not so much. 

The problem is that our heating demand in the UK is approximately equal to our entire electricity generating capacity. So if we want to move to a significant % of homes to heat pumps we have to be prepared to build a lot more powerstations.

Originally named Simon (the Hebrew name Shim'on), Jesus renamed him Peter (the Greek name Petros), meaning ""rock"". ""On this rock I will build my church"" he said. Peter was regarded as one of the most faithful, classically depicted as the leader and spokesman of the apostles. He is directly regarded as such by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. The Pope is considered Peter's successor in this role. Peter was martyred, crucified upside down, as part of Nero's persecution of the early church. Identifying Seven with Peter is an interesting choice. I'm not sure it's one I would have made, but I don't know that anyone else would be a better candidate either. The visual similarities between 7 and Peter in the original painting certainly make him a solid choice, I'm just also wracking my brain to think of any more symbolic reasons for the choice.

John, said to be the author of the Gospel of John, is also identified as the ""disciple whom Jesus loved"" frequently mentioned in said gospel.

Wednesday, 3 March 2010. The Danish national team plays half a forgettable friendly match in a cool stadium in Vienna. The opponent is Austria.

The time is 21:43 - perhaps a bit more - when the match fourth official, the local Harold Lechner, proceeds to the sidelines with his board in hand. At his side, he has a 18-year-old boy from Middelfart with a shy smile and a soil penetrating gaze.

Lechner throw the board up. Number 7, it says on it. It is Daniel Jensen's number. He fuses therefore out against the Austrian fourth judge and his young side buddy, while Lechner pills at the blackboard.

Also read:
Bold boy from Tranbjerg pulls in red and white

A new number shows up. This time the number 14. The number in red, is written on the chest of the smånervøse 18-year-old boy's white jersey.

Daniel Jensen applaud the teenager in his hands and sits down on the bench. While running the 18-year-old on the pitch. On the pitch for his first game for the Danish national football team.

Another man
Five years and 19 days later sitting the then 18-year-old kid in a hotel in Aarhus. He was a grown man of 23 years, but the smile is still shy. Eyes have become more insistent.

The man's name is Christian Eriksen. In the evening playing his national team number 50 for Denmark. Even in a rekordung age.

Since Wednesday in March 2010, much has changed for the young people of Fyn. He was then a young talent in Ajax Amsterdam without significant international experience. Today he is a profile in Tottenham - in the world's most widely promoted league Premier League.

Also on the national team, he is grown. He has become the central player in the offensive game and a building block for both present and future. All this has happened while one country-kampnål after another is put the shirt. Now when he was 50, shortly after his 23 birthday. Eighteen months before Michael Laudrup made it - and two and a half years before Brian Laudrup could celebrate same skarpthjørnede anniversary.

""I'm really happy that I am where I am. A place where I've tried a lot and know things. I am not nervous in the same way as I was before. Neither on the field or outside. I have matured and have gained more experience, ""says Christian Eriksen on the journey towards the 50th

Praise from the icon Klinsmann
The 50 are undoubtedly more. Many more.

In fact, it would be a surprise if Christian Eriksen not turn Peter Schmeichel test match record that sounds at 129 appearances in red and white. That day is however many years in the future. So Eriksen takes one anniversary at a time.

""I do not think about breaking records. Now that I play my test match number 50, I think obviously the number. It's something I do when there are milestones. And it is there now. It's very special to have played 50 matches already. I am incredibly happy, and it is also a tribute to the coach for giving me the chance every time, ""says Eriksen, is celebrating its anniversary on the United States and especially one of the greatest icons ever in his current club , Tottenham.

Tottenham legend Jürgen Klinsmann is on the US side line in Aarhus in the evening, and there is one player, the former German world champion is looking forward to see is the actress with the jubilee Eriksen.

""He is an exceptional talent. That's why he's in Tottenham, ""said Klinsmann grinning as Berlingske asks about his view of the Danish creators.

""No, he's great talented. When I see him and some of his goals this season, he is the difference in many matches. He can turn on a switch, and one should always be very aware and keen on him. To have the kind of players on your team will spark and the chance to make a difference when it really matters. So I'm excited to see him on the field, ""continues Klinsmann, who despite just one year in the White Tottenham jersey is one of the club's most beloved characters of all time.

What does it mean when a player at the age of only 23 years old when 50 matches?

""It shows that he is very focused and mature. He will of course have ups and downs, as all players in the world, but when you are already at that age have 50 matches, it shows a drive and an inner hunger. Otherwise you would not be there already. Hopefully container Eriksen the hunger and takes Denmark for the European Championships next year and the World Cup in Russia. I have a very special talent in him, ""says Klinsmann.

The normal national team
And hungry, Christian Eriksen. Hungry to lead the team that means so much, both forward and upward.

How big is the national team really in your daily life and your life?

""It fills a part. When I'm at home, that's what I follow. It is the other national team players, I read about. My family is fighting, and all Danes see it. Everyone I talk to, included in it. So it's very special. It is a Premier League match too, but it's in a different way, ""says Eriksen, however - of natural causes - has got a different picture of the national team than he had five years and 49 matches ago.

»National Team has become something normal. Something very recognizable. There are often changes with different players. Once I was one of the replacements. Now I see others who come in and go out again. On the way, I see what it is all about bypassing, ""explains the native of Funen.

He now knows what it's about. Both on the field and in the scenes where he's in the company of Daniel Agger, William Kvist and Lars Jacobsen represent the national team spillerråd. A council who make the decisions and take the matches against DBU - such as in the just ended conflict. But the player council is also top of the national team's hierarchy - and an obvious place to enlist Denmark's future captain.

Daniel Agger cancels the test match in Aarhus

Agger, Kvist and Lars Jacobsen is all getting a bit advanced in years. You are already sitting in the player council. Are you the next Danish captain?

""It is up to the coach. Will I offered, I'll gladly take. I think everyone would like to be captain of their national team. But it is not a goal as such. As type I may not be the most obvious captain of a team, ""says the former Ober.

""Right now I'm happy with the leaders we have. Of course, the other player in the council a little older than I am, so I'm trying to learn. It is also one of the reasons why I am with. So I when they stop by a little more than the others, there is a little younger. ""

And it makes Christian Eriksen. He knows much more than he once did. It celebrates his evening with another half unimportant friendly match in a cool stadium.

&gt; •	the physical attack lasted around 30 seconds and was halted by the intervention of a witness;

&gt; •	it is the case that Oisin Tymon offered no retaliation;

&gt; •	the verbal abuse was directed at Oisin Tymon on more than one occasion – both during the attack and subsequently inside the hotel – and contained the strongest expletives and threats to sack him. The abuse was at such volume as to be heard in the dining room, and the shouting  was audible in a hotel bedroom;

&gt; •	derogatory and abusive language, relating to Oisin Tymon and other members of the Top Gear team, continued to be used by Jeremy Clarkson inside the hotel, in the presence of others, for a sustained period of time;

&gt; •	it is clear that Oisin Tymon was shocked and distressed by the incident, and believed that he had lost his job;

&gt; •	following the attack, I understand that Oisin Tymon drove to a nearby A&amp;E department for examination;

&gt; •	over the subsequent days, Jeremy Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologise to Oisin Tymon by way of text, email and in person; and

&gt; •	it is the case that Jeremy Clarkson reported the incident to BBC management.

&gt; It was not disputed by Jeremy Clarkson or any witness that Oisin Tymon was the victim of an unprovoked physical and verbal attack. It is also clear to me that Oisin Tymon is an important creative member of the Top Gear team who is well-valued and respected.

&gt;Are corporations unable to lie or misrepresent themselves? Just because they cannot actually say ""we are suing you for lost profits"", that doesn't mean they are unable to sue someone for the sole purpose of regaining their profits under the guise of some other charge.

Well obviously they hope to recoup lost profits. I was pointing out that saying they can ""sue for lost profits"" implies that the *reason* for suing is the lost profits (something that would easily be provable in court, and hence get compensation for), as opposed to the reason being discriminatory government regulation.

&gt;As if the fact that 3 countries out of ~200 implementing this change is proof it had no effect.

Well, Australia only pioneered the concept back in, what? 2012? It's hardly surprising that more countries haven't gone for it yet, it's still brand-spanking new!

&gt;You are correct, there is a reason the legal system exists; luckily I am not arguing for the abolishment of the legal system just ISDS. Which companies are abusing, as you have admitted yourself. I do not know why you would defend a system that prohibits national governments from enacting policies that protect their citizens or environment simply because of lost ""investments"".

Which *some companies abuse*. But again, this is a problem inherent in legal systems, so I don't see why *here* it's unacceptable, but *there* it is. And the point is that I think it's fine for a company to be able to sue if it has been aggrieved, and then the legal system can establish if they're due compensation or not. I believe in the legal system, because we've built such bloody good ones over the last few thousand years. I don't think it's right that a government can abuse it's regulatory prerogative to the detriment of foreigners. I don't think it's right that 'tyranny of the majority' is considered an acceptable reason by many people to discriminate against foreign companies. 

As to your last sentence, if the government can implement such measures without discriminating *unfairly and in bad faith* against foreigners, then I think it's fine that the company can waste it's money suing the government, because according to the provisions of ISDS they have no chance in hell of winning. But if they're going to discriminate against foreigners (say a domesticity owned factory emits a particle at 70ppm, and the foreign owned one at 80 ppm, and the government implements regulations of a maximum of 75ppm arbitrarily and with no scientific reason for setting it at that level) then I am going to support ISDS.

Because it's a BBC property? It earns hundreds of millions for the Corporation, second only to Strictly Come Dancing. It's BBC Two's signature show and tops the Iplayer charts when it comes on.

&gt; Just spin it out into a separate entity

The BBC can't do that at present. Lord Hall has proposed that BBC Productions be spun off into a commercially-focused entity that would produce and own content commissioned not just for the BBC but for anyone else, in the same way that ITV Studios produces shows for Channel 4 and the BBC as well as for ITV. But that is something that'll require consultation and BBC Trust approval and is for after the election when the BBC's charter and settlement are being reviewed.

&gt; what's to stop them all from walking and just starting their own show on Sky

The BBC owns the Top Gear brand and the format. This means Sky can't just commission TG under another name. It would have to be a substantially different show.

Do you think traditional Labour supporters would welcome the party teaming up with the Tories to make welfare cuts? In such a circumstance the Tories would come out of it completely unscathed (because they would still be looking tough on benefits) and Labour would come out if it being portrayed as a party that is completely out of touch with the people it purports to represent. 

UKIP, the SNP, and the Green Party might have the freedom to be antagonistic rather than realistic but their growing support (and the inability of Labour or the conservatives to get a majority) shows a real distrust towards those traditionally in power. This would not be helped by Labour and the Tories working closely together.

&gt; Essentially this is the problem the Lib dems have also encountered - where now they are in power they've had to drop some of their more unrealistic proposals and adopt a more pragmatic approach to government.

I think this lets the Lib Dems off too easily. Compromise may often be valuable in politics but it is not the solution to everything; compromise on too much and nobody ends up getting what they want, and nobody knows exactly what each party stands for. The Lib Dems not being able to abolish tuition fees (in return for influence elsewhere) for example would be compromise. Being part of the reason tuition fees were tripled on the other hand goes far beyond that and undermines the values they once would have been seen to represent.

The same would apply if Labour got too close to the Tories. For many policies there is certainly room for compromise but when this extends to the compromise of key ideological differences that sets each party apart from each other the lines between those parties becomes too blurred for my liking.

Flying from a white transit, on a rainy Tuesday in January? I'd make the assumption that the driver is, at best, a UKIP voter.

For as long as I can remember the flag of St George has had an association with the unpleasant right, not an ""omg george Osborn is a fashist"" right, but actual NF, BNP knuckle dragger right. I think there was a chance for its use to be acceptable in the New labour years (not from anything they did, just it had been a long time since either faction had polled well) but with the rise of the EDL, BF and the like, I can see its image moving back to its use only being associated with racists once again.

Now you can question wether it's appropriate to cast aspersions to somebody flying a flag, based on somebody else's use of said banner, but let's look at the ""ISIS"" flag, AFAIK all the flag is is the shahada in white text on a black field, all the shahada is is a statement that ""there is no God but God and Mohammed is his messenger"" not a controversial statement to come from the lips of a Muslim, or for a Muslim to say.

1. Get experience. If your course does a year in industry (or similar) then take it, if not, intern during the summers, if not freelance. If you can, do them all. For me, my year in industry was wayyy more valuable than my degree. I learnt more in the first 3-4 months working in industry that I did in 2 years at uni.   
2. Do the extra stuff, volunteer, travel, coach football, lead scouts, be part of a team for something. If you get to the interview (or assessment days) everybody will be as good as you on paper, you need to be able to show what you did to go the extra mile and that you're a nice person. You need to come across as an interesting person. Every boy seems to list his hobby as football, if I heard that in a interview I would just discard it. It really builds character.  
3. Have examples of times when you've taken ownership and accountability for things. The grad schemes are often a way to slingshot people in to management. If you have examples which support their requirements well, and they think you have longer term potential its puts you in a good place. Everything you say you should be able to back with an example of when you used that skills or quality.     
4. Apply early. I applied in September 2013 for a job that started August 2014. Most of the schemes are like that for the bigger places. 
  
If you want to talk a little more about the process,and what the days involve (its pretty intense and a bit different) just message me. I'll give you my number and we can have a call if you wish even. Just let me know.

Fair point, thanks for your input on all the other comments. I merely commented based on someones suggestion that it was impossible to consider that Clarkson could stay. I would have liked to think there was another solution and am personally disappointed that its seemingly impossible to continue the show as is. It seems that the result is simply due to the legality of it and Clarkson's existing dicey position due to his subtle and offensive jokes. I would have liked to think that all involved could have potentially banded together and resolved the rift without his leaving having occurred as I doubt the massive fan base the show has would tolerate a complete change of hosts.  

&gt; But they can't make a show that resembles the format of Top Gear. The BBC owns that.

Given GovIT already have an iOS management service in place (since 2012), the cost of binning that and moving to some other platform (and retraining all the tech staff on the new system) is going to far outweigh the price difference between the user hardware options.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"&gt; Do you think traditional Labour supporters would welcome the party teaming up with the Tories to make welfare cuts

No of course not. But it would be a measure of opinion. Abandoning the highly controversial and much publicized bedroom tax in favour of removing winter fuel payments would be a huge victory for labour. So no, I don't agree with the point that labour and the tories can't agree. If Labour and the SNP can magically agree on policy, and even the lib dems and tories can agree on legislation, then labour and the tories can agree too. To believe otherwise is to buy into the SNP fallacy that any form of agreement between labour and the tories is *""just another sign they are the same""*.

I agree on your latter points about the Lib Dems. All I can offer in their defense (which feels wrong frankly) is that we were all naive to coalitions 5 years ago. I'm sure they would do it very differently now... but maybe, just maybe, it betrays how little downstream influence you can exert on a party once you get them into government. Even in a confidence and supply arrangement it just isn't viable to hold what are effectively your colleagues to ransom every 5 minutes. At the best you have to choose your battles wisely else they might call your bluff and try to use the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 to force another election. I do concede though that the Lib Dems could have managed the situation better. By 2012 they had retreated into damage limitation mode and haven't really recovered since.

You can set them up with a provisioning profile so that they come to your local update server (so you control which and when apple updates get pushed out - just as Windows computers in a corporate environment don't bug their users to update - IT run them network-wide at 1am).

You slave them to your Device Management Platform and you select allowable apps, remote wipe, VPN and proxy settings. They stop being slaved to Apple.

The worst part is I can't really see any way out of it short of new political leaders who are interested in collaborating and working together for the common good rather than treating each other like enemies. But I don't know who could possibly fill those roles. Hopefully this election sees off cameron and milliband and some better people replace them.

One thing I'll say though is that the SNP's rise in Scotland has adequately demonstrated that change in politics is possible even without political reform. If polls are accurate and they do sweep up loads of seats at the next election then that will be historic, but it hasn't taken any electoral reform to make this happen. All it's taken is for people to realise their votes do count and to use them differently, helped by the fact that a party has emerged they feel comfortable voting for. Unfortunately I can't think of any similar parties in England and Wales. The greens and plaid cymru are both firmly on the left with strong ideologies that deter people, and UKIP don't look appealing either. The SNP have a simple winning formula of being a pragmatic centre-left party that stands for no ideological reason other than independence, meaning that in the day to day governance they're free to use ideas that make sense from anywhere on the political spectrum and less inclined to do radical but relatively useless things for the sake of their ideology. Perhaps a new party will emerge that fills that slot nicely for all of Britain.

null,false,Helenarth,null,null,null,"**Name of product** PIZ BUIN Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 15

**Price of product** £12 but got it free with a Superdrug BOGOF

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug

**Product claims:** This face fluid combines immediate and effective UVA/UVB protection with an ultra light formula that dries instantly.

The hydrating fluid spreads easily over your skin for a weightless dry touch feel.

The non sticky and non greasy formula absorbs instantly without leaving white marks, which makes it ideal to be worn daily.

Enriched with an anti-oxidant* Vitamin E derivative, it helps to prevent sun induced premature skin ageing. Sweat and water resistant. 

**About you:** Tans really easily, never burned. Prone to close comedones and slight acne, dry patches in the winter, oily overall. 

**Your opinion:** *Gonna update this after I've used it properly, this is mostly a reminder to myself. After trying some on my skin it feels really nice, genuinely really light and quick-drying, the smell is lovely but quite strong! Quite a tropical smell, I think Piz Buin stuff smells really distinctive, not sunscreen-y at all.*

After using, here are my thoughts. It's quite thick, but absorbs quickly. It feels quite greasy for about a minute before it soaks in, after that it just feels soft. I really love the smell (it's a weaker version of the tropical, sweet scent other Piz Buin sunscreens have) but it's still quite noticeable for a facial product. People who are very sensitive to perfume may not be a fan. After applying, it's really lovely - it seems to have quite a balancing effect, mattifying oily areas and hydrating dry areas, leaving a natural look. If I apply it over a heavy moisturiser it does get a bit shiny, but using my regular light moisturiser it's completely fine. I'm honestly surprised at how much I like it - I've been a total sunscreen hater since I was a kid but this is something totally different. It feels more like a balancing serum than a sunscreen. The main downside is the price :( Too expensive for me to buy regularly unless it's on offer. Haven't noticed any breakouts or irritation since I've started using it, which is great because the last facial ""non-oily"" sunscreen I used made me a greasy spotty mess lol. Would definitely recommend, especially to those who would normally skip sunscreen because they hate how it feels!

I think your experience with halls with differ depending on which hall you pick and which block you get allocated. I opted for a catered hall and have lived at Dalton Ellis as well as Hulme Hall. The buildings in these 2 halls are old and yes the walls are thin. Id be able to hear a phone conversation from some guy upstairs. With that said, the majority of halls have their own dedicated library within the hall facility so for me its just a 2 minute walk to a quiet space.   
If you're still more inclined to studying in your room id either recommend Weston Hall in the North Campus which is right next to where lectures are held or you could try looking for a private hall. If you have the money for it I've heard plenty of good things about Student Castle.  
Also your university experience and social life will vary greatly depending on where you live.
Living in North Campus is a little quieter and more appropriate for the study oriented crowd while the people who are only interested in partying tend to live in Fallowfield. I picked the middle ground and decided on a catered hall because its nice to wake up to a spread of food all prepared for you and its also a great place to meet people over meals. The JCR(student association) at Hulme is also very active and they organise a lot of subsidised events. If I'm not mistaken they are allocated to spend £10,000 on events for us.

**Price of product** £17.50

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug

**Product claims:** Combines UVA/UVB HELIOPLEX™ sun filters with Melitan, which helps enhance your skin's own natural tan*.

So now you can build a gorgeous, natural tan without compromising on your level of protection.

The lotion provides hours of moisturisation, which prevents peeling and contributes to a longer lasting tan

**About you:** Tans really easily, never burned. Body skin is prone to feeling tight/itchy, but doesn't generally *look* flaky or dry.

**Your opinion:** Gonna update this after I've used it properly, this is mostly a reminder to myself. I tried a bit on my hand quick, and so far it just feels like... lotion. Doesn't feel massively moisturising, only a little, but at least it's not greasy or anything.

**Where did you purchase:** Mannings (pharmacy chain in Hong Kong), /r/AsianBeauty has a list of online retailers in the sidebar

**Product claims:**

**About you:** Combo dehydrated skin, prone to diet related break outs, sensitive to exfoliants, fair to medium skin tone that tans and doesn't burn.

**Your opinion:** A light weight lotion/liquid with a lot of slip, enough to skip an additional primer, and a fairly light non-descript fragrance. It absorbs very quickly thanks to the alcohol but not enough for me to find drying, in fact applying too much too quickly gives me a greasy moisturised feeling.

Unfortunately I suspect that the orange oil eventually got to my skin and I had to discontinue use.

However, I'm neither a party person nor a *stereotypical nerd*. My top choice is Sheavyn House; anything specific you can say about Sheavyn? (perhaps something you've heard through a friend?)

The JCR at Hlume sounds great. I don't mind the wall of text, it's alright.

Would you recommend any sort of reading to be done before going to uni? Maybe something about Physics or Maths? I haven't done Further Maths, so I'm thinking of self studying it (Eventhough I wouldn't be doing the exam). Do you think it would be of any help? Also, was there a huge jump between A'level (or the pre university qualification you did) and university teaching? (kind of scared to set off to study for a degree)

Also, what are your comments about the city Manchester?

I suspect that would be illegal.

The power to hold a referendum was temporarily devolved under Orders in Council, specifically The Scotland Act 1998 (Modification of Schedule 5) Order 2013.

Section 3.5A.(2) stated:

""The date of the poll at the referendum must not be the date of the poll at any other referendum held under provision made by the Parliament.""

Whilst an EU referendum would not be held under the provisions made by said Parliament and would not preclude an independence referendum from taking place, the Scottish Parliament does not actually have the power to call another referendum and would not do without a further Statutory Instrument being laid before Parliament.

null,false,WolfThawra,Wolfson,Wolfson,null,"I'm enjoying it a lot (2nd year now). Mornings are usually spent doing labs (... trying to figure out what the hell I'm supposed to do), and I've got supervisions in the afternoon, probably about 3 to 4 a week on average (depending on the term).

I personally don't benefit from going to lectures, so I've cut that part out completely - I'm working exclusively off the handouts. They try to make you go to lectures by leaving gaps in the handouts, but you usually can get the completed ones from an engineer a year or two above you.

Work load is really high, but then I tend to force myself to work quite a lot, maybe more than I'd necessarily have to. It is however manageable - *if you manage it!* Meaning, try to plan in advance what to do when instead of just looking two days ahead. That's the best way of getting trapped in one of those situations where you have too many deadlines to meet at the same time.

Also, it obviously depends on what else you do. I've been rowing ever since I started here, which is probably one of the most time-consuming sports. It is however totally possible to still manage the work load.

Another tip: be realistic about what you're struggling with, i.e. try to get help if you're starting to lag behind a lot in one subject (especially Maths, because that's kind of the base for quite a few other subjects). I didn't do that in my first year and it meant a lot of extra work to catch up before the exams I could have avoided with a slightly more intelligent approach. Supervisors are to some extent quite helpful. If you got one that's particularly bad, don't do what I did, i.e. nothing, try to make him put more effort into it, and if that doesn't work, go to your DoS.

Oh, and one last thing: don't put too much effort into things that don't matter. E.g. most lab reports - not worth spending too much time for, you'll get standard credit anyway.

Find our manifesto [here](http://mhocsocialists.dudaone.com/).

Now you _could_ vote for this candidate, but lets be frank: what can a bear really do in parliament? This bear - and don't get me wrong, he's no bad, but this one has no definite plan of action.  And there's not a single mention in his manifesto of Holyrood! How can a candidate that want to represent Scotland at the UK not even consider arguing for greater autonomy for the people who live here?

Now, you could go awa and vote SNP, but that wouldna do any good.  Their manifesto is a right big pile o' shite.  Let's take a lookie:

&gt; 2.2) We will not borrow any money. We will only spend what is raised in Taxation, over-the-top projects will be shelved.

We currently have a £50 bln deficit.  In order for this to be met, other programmes would have to be cut.  Dramatically.  So how do they plan on making these cuts

&gt;International Aid Fund to be eliminated

So they suggest entirely cancelling DfID? I'm sorry, but that is more reminiscent of UKIP, not the SNP!

&gt;1) We will disband the UK military and replace it with a National Defence Force.

When questioned on this, they have stated that it will consist of just a 1000 man force.  Considering, currently, over 200000 people are employed in the military directly, with many more indirectly.  While I agree we should reduce military spending, this is not the way to do it.  Remember the protests against RAF Leuchars? Imagine that, all over again, across the country.  The damage to local economies would be immense.

But I'm not just here to talk about other parties with no regard to my own.  No, in the Scottish Socialist Party, I am campaigning to not only grant more power to local communities, whether this be Scotland as whole,or the people who live under Dundee City Council.  I will fight against any attempt to slash our precious social services.  I will fight to spread the tax burden more equally around society.  I will fight to make Scotland a world leader in renewable energy, and to attempt to tackle the declining manufacturing and support services sectors.

Find our manifesto [here](http://mhocsocialists.dudaone.com/).

Now you _could_ vote for this candidate, but lets be frank: what can a bear really do in parliament? This bear - and don't get me wrong, he's no bad, but this one has no definite plan of action.  And there's not a single mention in his manifesto of Holyrood! How can a candidate that want to represent Scotland at the UK not even consider arguing for greater autonomy for the people who live here? He's a Celtic nationalist: a defunct 'identity', to be sure.

Now, you could go awa and vote SNP, but that wouldna do any good.  Their manifesto is a right big pile o' shite.  Let's take a lookie:

&gt; 2.2) We will not borrow any money. We will only spend what is raised in Taxation, over-the-top projects will be shelved.

We currently have a £50 bln deficit.  In order for this to be met, other programmes would have to be cut.  Dramatically.  So how do they plan on making these cuts

&gt;International Aid Fund to be eliminated

So they suggest entirely cancelling DfID? I'm sorry, but that is more reminiscent of UKIP, not the SNP!

&gt;1) We will disband the UK military and replace it with a National Defence Force.

When questioned on this, they have stated that it will consist of just a 1000 man force.  Considering, currently, over 200000 people are employed in the military directly, with many more indirectly.  While I agree we should reduce military spending, this is not the way to do it.  Remember the protests against RAF Leuchars? Imagine that, all over again, across the country.  The damage to local economies would be immense.

But I'm not just here to talk about other parties with no regard to my own.  No, in the Scottish Socialist Party, I am campaigning to not only grant more power to local communities, whether this be Scotland as whole,or the people who live under Dundee City Council.  I will fight against any attempt to slash our precious social services.  I will fight to spread the tax burden more equally around society.  I will fight to make Scotland a world leader in renewable energy, and to attempt to tackle the declining manufacturing and support services sectors.

A few years ago our daughter was killed in a car accident, my wife spiraled into depression, eventually developing schizophrenia, I worked for myself and made a decent living, but as the NHS pissed about trying different drugs, ignoring what had worked in the past due to it being too expensive (yes they said this to me)



Eventually she spiralled to being suicidal, the cut backs meant they couldn't hospitalise her and said either I should give up work or expect to come back to her dead. So obviously I gave up work to look after her, eventually this led to us losing our home, work had been slowing down anyway while I spent more time looking after her than working.


We had a static caravan, we lived in that for 18 months and then temp accommodation for 3 months and now live in a 1 bedroom council flat where we have been for 11 months.



They finally gave her the treatment that had helped her in the past last month. I can easily see how suicide is the answer for people, I went from earning 40k a year, to not going out due to looking after my wife other than hospital visits.

A referendum is valid if there is significant support for what it is proposing. You don't need to be sure of a majority beforehand, that is a mockery of democracy, referendums aren't simply rubber stamps.


The arguments the opposing parties made was that there wasn't significant support to hold a referendum. Even the Lib Dems made this argument before themselves introducing a referendum for AV that no one had been talking about.


In 2007 the SNP became the largest party in the Scottish Parliament, they formed the government with their primary manifesto pledge of holding a referendum. If having a First Minister who champions a referendum is not a sign of significant support for that referendum, I don't know what is. 


The other parties got it spectacularly wrong, as proven in the next election when the Scottish people elected the SNP as a majority government, in a Parliament designed never to give one party a majority.",null,0,null,1427316193,null,0,false,0,cpqmqza,null,t3_308l90,null,t1_cpqmqza,null,t1_cpqlakf,null,null,null,1432012275,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null
null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"Meh. I think it's just a propaganda plug by the SNP. 

It's like me saying I could run the country better than Cameron. It's easy because since I don't actually have the chance to do it, I can make all sorts of claims none of which are going to be tested. Claims like ""I'd abolish the bedroom tax, I'd abolish Trident, I'd make the rich pay more tax and the poor would get more state sponsored benefits"".

It's simple because nobody can test me on it. Now when Cameron doesn't do those things he looks bad... but if he tries to do them pretty soon he's struggling to pay down the deficit, there are bank runs, the US/NATO is in a rage because the UK just unilaterally disarmed in the face of a resurgent Russia and British business owners/wealth generators are flocking out of the country faster than you can say UKIP. 

That's why it's easy for a party like the SNP to make claims that are toxic to the UK relationship. There are clear divisions between the parties and any notion that there isn't is in the eye of the beholder;

* Labour, although seeing through fiscal restraint plan to curtail the rate the conservatives have thus far done it at. They are also likely to ideologically target different policy areas for cuts... 

* For example labour are more likely to cut older-age benefits like the winter fuel payment than working age benefits.

* There are big differences in their policies on one of the biggest issues; Housing. Labour plan to regulate the rental sector whereas the Tories plan to subsidise entry onto the owner-occupier market through help-to-buy and the new homeowners ISA.

* Labour plan to cut tuition fees to £6K pa, the conservatives (although they haven't officially said it) are more likely to simply deregulate higher education and allow institutions to charge whatever they want (i.e. more).

* Labour are openly pro-immigration regardless of its social costs. The Tories are clearly more reluctant and are likely to impose stricter entry criteria up to and including their mooted referendum.

These are just a few examples of divergent policy areas. Essentially the way its shaping up right now, if you are young and earning below the average income then voting labour would be wise. If you are older or earning over the average income, particularly if you are looking to buy property, then you should consider voting conservative.

You can buy into the SNP rhetoric all you like... but the reality is it won't be their policies in Westminster. ",null,0,null,1427316201,null,0,false,0,cpqmr73,null,t3_305r5b,null,t1_cpqmr73,null,t1_cpqm5zw,null,null,null,1432012278,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

From his past performances he could be worth taking a chance on, but we'd be better off going for different targets in my opinion.

Along with that, I'd have doubts about whether he's the actual player we need right now. He's not a defensive midfielder like some people seem to suggest, so he wouldn't be a replacement for Lucas if he does indeed go. Khedira is a more box to box player. When he was sitting with Alonso in midfield for Mardid, he was the one unning forward all the time, leaving room for Alonso to play his game. His pressing game isn't fantastic either. We already have several midfielders who can do his job in midfield already, and on current form he wouldn't be a huge improvement.

His wages would indeed be quite high, and he'd also command a pretty high signing bonus, so he wouldn't that free of a free transfer ha.

That being said, it's a testament to Courtois to compare his first EPL season with De Gea. He's been so solid in comparison.

Use recorded signed-for post and keep the receipt.

I suggest if your LL isn't the most tech savvy person, you might also explain that as a favor to him/her you're demanding the cost of only one component, and plan to install it yourself, as someone less technically proficient myself might write off the whole thing and get a new one, or at least take it to somewhere like PC World with their flat fees for diagnosing and repairing the simplest problems.

You need to keep the damaged GPU around, and take photos if the damage is visible. If you go ahead and replace it yourself prior to receiving compensation, keep the old one and the receipt for the new one (a printed-out order confirmation email is fine).

Other than this, a few people have explained some of your options. Small-claims court is easier than you probably think - you *can't* have legal aid there for a start, and you might not even have to go to court if they offer (and you and your LL accept) mediation or a judgment without a hearing. If you do, it's time out of your life and a pain and all that, but it won't break the bank. If you win, you get your deposit back and the LL has to pay it to the court, and you could be in and out in as little as ten minutes if you have to go in at all.

Oh, and at worst your LL might try to convince the court to only force him/her to play the second-hand cost of a similar GPU but I'm sure you know full well why second hand PC parts are less acceptable than, say, second hand books and can explain this on the day, if necessary.

Citizens' Advice should be able to help you start a claim in your area if you want to go ahead with small claims court, and if you'd prefer to try working things out with the landlord first you can likely contact Shelter for some advice. I think either Shelter or Citizens' Advice can put you in touch with a local authority mediator though I'm not sure how obliged the landlord would be to participate in that.

Fair enough, but I think most reasonable people would prefer that they had a third category though, called ""he's helpless on the ground with your knee in his groin and nobody to back him up, so de-escalate the situation and talk him down for a few seconds, explain calmly why you're arresting him and that by resisting he's only going to get himself in even more trouble"".

My wife's a mental health nurse - she's not allowed to be violent (technically not even in self-defence) and as a 5-foot-two tiny asian lady she has no physical superiority over *any* of her service users... and yet she manages to handle and de-escalate situations even when confronted with violent, hallucinating six-foot schizophrenics without the use of force.  This guy was a trained, grown man with his entire body-weight pinning a teenage kid to the ground, who wasn't fighting back or trying to get away - merely refusing to actively assist with his own handcuffing.

I hear what you're saying, and perhaps the police do only consider situations to be either ""lethal force"" or ""anything short of lethal force""... but if that's actually true then their categories are *severely fucked up* and arguably no more defensible than a grown man pepper-spraying a restrained but passively non-compliant teenager for refusing to uncross his arms.",null,0,null,1427317186,null,0,false,0,cpqnemw,null,t3_308s10,null,t1_cpqnemw,null,t1_cpq79nv,null,null,null,1432012584,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Since 2010 UK government spending has went up year on year and because Osborne tends toward cutting reserved matters heavier than he cuts devolved matters it hasn't impacted the Holyrood budget *too* much.

There's also different priorities. For example Osborne cut something like 17% from police &amp; education (devolved) but shuffled the money into a ~4% NHS increase so the net effect on Scotland was an overall 7% cut in real terms.

I start my cycle from my house and join the Water of Leith at the Tickled Trout (I think it has a different name now) off Slateford Road. Follow the path all the way up to The end at Balerno. From there you take the road on the left after the school (is it Manse Road? **Bavelaw Road which becomes Mansfield Road, was close!**) cycle up until you see a sign for Harlaw Reservoir and follow that road. It's usually very quiet, hardly see any cars, and those that you do see are careful when they pass you. Once you get to the car park at Harlaw you can follow the path that goes straight up the hill, once you get to the top there is a very fun, fast, rocky descent all the way to Glencorse reservoir. Feel free to pop into Flotterstone for a mid cycle refreshment (beer!?) take a right and cycle along the side of Glencorse and up the hill to Loganlea, this then takes you around the black hill then down towards Threipmuir and Harlaw. Then you can just cycle back down the way you came or take another route that will take you to Bonaly. 

That's probably really difficult to understand but it makes sense in my head.

Why did I change? - When I looked at the composition of my Nutmeg portfolio, a significant majority of it was just passive trackers anyway. Effectively I was paying 1% a year for Nutmeg to do what I can do on my own anyway for far less. Granted, their website *is* very slick, but in the long run that 1% is going to hinder growth pretty seriously.

Also, as an aside, when you get a raise you should consider paying more into your Share incentive plan if your scheme allows it. You won't get any additional matching shares but it *does* come from pre-tax pay, so once you hit the higher tax bracket you're getting the shares at a 40% discount.

Telling people that the word 'tranny' is a hate crime.  

No platforming people who have different points of view about transgenderism.  See this very PDF, in which the feminist Julie Bindel is denounced as a heretic for her views.

Having an opinion columnist (Julie Burchill) fired from the Guardian for insulting transgender people's feelings.  She was fired after a campaign in which hundreds of people wrote in calling for her sacking.

But it's so much more than that.

But whilst I find myself agreeing with a lot of what these parties *purport* to stand for, I find that I have little trust in any of them.

The Greens have little basis in reality, and have shown themselves too inexperienced to rule. Even if they were to gain a significant amount of seats sufficient to hold some power in a coalition it would be difficult to determine exactly what their aims would be.

The Lib Dems have shown themselves willing to sacrifice policy for power. The tuition fees betrayal and AV referendum (two policies I previously considered very important) lead me to question exactly why I should take notice of any of their policies, because it is impossible to determine exactly which policies would survive a coalition.

And I absolutely detest the politics of fear used by the Labour party (and the Tories) where they preach that a vote for anyone but themselves (such as for the SNP, Greens, or UKIP) is a wasted vote that will only serve the greater evil. As true as it unfortunately may be I feel it is both patronising and undemocratic, and I think that a political party should be able to attain votes by merit of their policies than by fear. The party also seems torn between Blairites and those on the left, which I feel makes them ideologically bereft and a bit populist.

Since graduating I had a shit time looking for jobs. I worked in a kitchen, in a call centre and temping in various places before getting my current graduate job in media (with a crap salary).

Compare that to a mate of mine who did an Economics joint honours and got a job with JP Morgan straight out of uni.

I have regretted doing History at Uni since while it's a tough degree, lots of people do it at Uni and because the skills required to study it successfully aren't immediately transferable, it's necessary to sell your skills as much as possible.

I've been unemployed for three months after leaving uni, lost sleep over the opportunities I should have taken (never got involved in student media which would have looked good on my CV), felt rubbish because a couple of my mates who didn't go to Uni got into pretty good jobs after sixth form, whereas I'd spent three years for fuck all, and thought of suicide on more than one occasion.

Even today, I still feel stuck, as the job I'm in is in an industry in decline. Not to mention as someone with mild autism, I've always found it tough to relate to other people, and sometimes resorted to 'trying to be funny' to break the ice at classes, parties etc., which even today I still feel guilty about. I also felt reluctant to go out (especially in first year) as sometimes, all I'd think of doing is not doing anything. I didn't raise this until second year at uni when I got some support.

 I spoke to my GP four months ago about feeling depressed and was referred to some learning disability support unit the local health board offers, but haven't heard anything since then. I did try anti-depressants as my GP said he'd prescribe them if I felt extremely low, but all they did was stop me sleeping. I ended up with no sleep for a week until I stopped them.

Still, if it weren't for uni, I wouldn't be in the job I'm in now, which may lead onto better things, and I wouldn't have met my best mate.

I'd like to see them a bit more allied but there are tensions between them. There have been talks about working together more but they still run candidates against each other all the time.

Up here the SP and PBP have a similar bit of tension even though they will work with one another to an extent. Like for example they'd end up rowing over who gets to talk at events and stuff that one or the other might organise and then might have rows when they show up to each others public meetings. It's weird, it's silly and generally small enough stuff but it happens.

What's frustrating is if they worked together under one umbrella organisation rather than two separate umbrellas then we could have nearly 30 local council seats and 4 TDs down south instead of dividing that up.

As it is though AAA is doing better at the moment. They got 200 new members last weekend which I don't think is something PBP could ever say.

And because they already have an iOS MDM in place that supports over 200 MPs?

It'd cost a hell of a lot more to tear it up and start over with a new Android Enterprise App Store, Device Management service, provisioning, etc.

People keep bringing up the price of the tablets, but the device cost is irrelevant. It's a tiny proportion of the total cost of operating them. You see a £200 tablet and a £500 tablet and thinking ""they're spending twice what they need to"". Thing is, the user hardware is a few percent of the total project spend, so your shifting your overall spending by fractions of a percent. And if those fractions are offset by another area of spending (like the Device Management Platform) having to be torn out and entirely replaced, then that blows all your savings right out the water. You need to consider Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), not Capital Cost.

Maybe in another 5 years (when the system is 10 years old and the platform is in need of replacement *anyway*), they'll reevaluate where Android, Windows tablets and iOS have got to and whether to continue with a newer version of their iOS platform or make the jump. But at enterprise level that's not something you do every 4 years right after you've just finished implementing it and figuring out how to make it all work right!

One would suggest a pension is a good idea if you are looking long term, as it is unlikely the state pension will be anything decent by the time you hit that age. But equally locking the money away is a hard concept to get to terms with. I work in the financial sector and have a very rational head about me but because my Dad died young (under 40) I can not possibly imagine living to an age older than him so I find pensions a very difficult thing to process, even though their benefits are undeniable (free money from employers + tax relief).

If you are looking to save long term, a stocks and shares ISA may be wise, and will likely outperform a cash ISA over that **longer term**. Of course, there are risks, you may lose some money if the funds you invest in go down in value, so it's worth doing some good reading on the subject. I invest in a mix of high and low risk funds and am currently on about 4.5% growth after 6 months, but this obviously fluctuates daily.

If you are utilising a cash ISA, switch every single time there is a better rate. There's no penalty to doing this and you are simply losing money if you do not. Unless you are in a fixed term ISA there will be no penalty in withdrawing all your money

Property is... property. It goes up, it goes down. If you'd bought a flat in london 10 years ago it'll have blitzed any gains elsewhere but equally some places elsewhere have shown no growth, plus there's a lot of other costs in owning a home, and a mortgage will obviously cost you money, too.

Personally, if I had 30k cash around, I'd whack £15k into some sort of tracker based S&amp;S ISA literally today, keep 2k in a TSB Reward account, and maybe £3k elsewhere, perhaps Santander 123 or a Club Lloyds account if I could be bothered. Then after april 5th I'd drop the rest into that S&amp;S account.

I'm not talking primarily about the security of the VPN whilst used over WiFi, although that's certainly questionable when you consider the possibility of targeting attacks against your gateway, spoofed DNS, MITM on the certificates and a whole host of other targeted attacks that are well within the resources and capabilities of hostile nation states.

&gt; The whole point of a VPN is that even if your entire connection is monitored, a third party cannot see what you were browsing.

My point was more that whilst you're connected to the public WiFi and before you have established the VPN, there is the possibility for a well resourced attacker to you use an unpublished exploit to access your machine and employ a useful payload for their future use.

Someone is unlikely to spend the resources required for this just to attack you or I, but you can be fairly sure they would for a high value target like a head of state or a senior minister.

The F-22A is likely to be shooting the ERAAM, and some USAF F-15Cs are being fitted with active phased arrays, with the likely prospect of getting ERAAMs as well, or even a ramjet AMRAAM variant. Therefore it is likely that most of the supporting assumptions used in the study are very stale, if not irrelevant.

In the parliament, we have introduced massive tax reform, abolishing Council Tax and Business rates, and replacing them with a much more fair Land Value Tax, we have also tied the personal allowance to the minimum wage.

In the next parliament, we are committed to introducing and passing a digital bill of rights, to ensure that we protect civil liberties and online privacy, and ensure that the rights of individuals.

Personally my dream manifesto would be virtually the sheer opposite;

* Austerity approximately to the figures Osbourne has laid out... but a notion that if the situation changes the rate of change might be adjusted to match it. 
* Reform of both the rental sector and BTL to effectively make it harder to buy to let and encourage professionalisation of the industry into larger corporations rather than one man band landlords. Landlords would get stronger powers to get money back when their properties are left in ruin but tenants would come out far better off overall with the power to rapidly challenge unfair evictions or poor standards. 
* Renegotiation of free movement within the EU.
* A move towards an insurance backed healthcare system (care would be universal coverage but hospitals wouldn't be like in Belgium/France etc. So if you wanted a private room/nice food you'd just pay more for it. After all, you have to feed and shelter yourself when you're healthy - I don't see why the taxpayer should fund it when your sick. The doctors/nurses and care would be the same regardless though. Most of Western Europe has systems like these).
* I would back a reduction in tuition fees (I do agree that raising them was absolutely regressive).

BTW - I'm not advocating anyone harass transgender people or anyone.

You attend your rearranged appointment and then get a letter saying your benefits will be stopped because going to a job interview isn’t a good enough reason to miss an appointment.


&gt;* Your gran dies during the night. The next morning your partner calls the job centre and asks if you can come in the following day instead. The centre agrees, and you sign in the next day. Then you get a letter stating that you failed to sign in and would be sanctioned if you don’t reply within seven days. You reply, explaining the situation. The job centre gives you a six-week sanction for not replying.


&gt;* You’ve signed in on time, been to interviews and applied for work. Your job centre advisor suggests you make a two-line change to your CV, which you do, but fail to give the updated CV to the job centre (you weren’t told you had to). You are sanctioned for four weeks.


&gt;* You get a job that starts in two weeks time. You don’t look for work while you are waiting for the job to start. You’re sanctioned.


&gt;* You are forced to retire due to a heart condition, and you claim Employment and Support Allowance. During your assessment you have a heart attack. You are sanctioned for not completing your assessment.


&gt;* It’s Christmas Day and you don’t fill in your job search evidence form to show that you’ve looked for all the new jobs that are advertised on Christmas Day. You are sanctioned. Merry Christmas. 


&gt;* You apply for three jobs one week and three jobs the following Sunday and Monday. Because the job centre week starts on a Tuesday it treats this as applying for six jobs in one week and none the following week. You are sanctioned for 13 weeks for failing to apply for three jobs each week.


&gt;* Your job centre advisor tells you that emailing your CV to a company is not enough; you must physically hand over a paper copy too. You must also provide printouts of all emails to your advisor. You cannot afford this - you do not have your own printer - so are told to give the advisor access to your personal email account. You check with another advisor who tells you to do as the first advisor required.

It's probably daunting learning about a new sport for the first time, i'm trying to get into the NFL at the moment so I can relate. 

I'll give you a bit of the background on the club: We're possibly having our best season in the Premier League era at the moment challenging for a European spot. Our manager is Ronald Koeman who's been with the club since last June, replacing Mauricio Pochettino who left us to join Tottenham. In NFL I believe you have both a head coach and a general manager? In association football the manager can have a lot more of a say over what players join the team but it depends on the club. 

Historically we're probably regarded as a mid-table team but the board are very ambitious and we've been on a gradual ascendancy over the past few seasons. In NFL they have the draft where they bring in college players. However many professional teams in England will have their own academys of which we have arguably have one of the strongest in England producing players such as Gareth Bale (the world's most expensive player), Luke Shaw, Theo Walcott, Adam Lallana and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the last few years. Going back a decade or two the academy's also produced Alan Shearer who's scored the most goals in Premier League history as well as Matt Le Tissier arguably the club's greatest player.

**-Who is our greatest rival now/all time?**

Portsmouth FC. They've unfortunatley been completley mismanaged by terrible owners and have fallen down the leagues so we don't actually get to play them at all nowdays.

**-Who is our best player?** 

I wouldn't really say this season's squad has a star player, everyone's on quite a similar level. If i had to pick probably one of Morgan Schneiderlin, Jose Fonte or Nathaniel Clyne.

**-What's our position of biggest need?**

I would've said a striker up until Saturday's game, Fraser Forster our keeper was injured so we'll need to look into that in the summer. As for striker however we lost our top two goalscorers Jay Rodriguez to injury last season and Rickie Lambert who left to join Liverpool. Our new striker this season Graziano Pelle had a really good first few months of the season but has gone through a bit of a goalscoring drought since January.

**-Any good highlight videos out there I should watch?**

As someone else ITT said, watch some of Matt Le Tissier's highlight reels. Not sure if they'll be readily availible on the internet but our 1976 fa cup win would be a good watch as well.

Also we happen to be blessed with a very good media team so the youtube channel's packed with interviews, press conferences, U18/U21 highlights: https://www.youtube.com/user/theofficialsaints

**-What is our league? English league? Do leagues send top teams to the world cup?**

Okay so to explain this we play in the Barclays Premier League which is the highest professional league of football in England. The season is played from August to May. 20 teams play each other twice, once at home and once away. You get 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw/tie and 0 for a loss. When the season is over the team with the most points is crowned champions. Generally, the top 4 will qualify for the Champions League. 5th will qualify for the Europa league, as will the domestic cup winners. The bottom three teams at the end of the season are relegated to the Football League Championship and the top three teams from that league are promoted to the Premier League.

Most countries have a domestic cup, these are a knockout tournaments as opposed to a league style competition. We have the FA Cup and the League Cup in England.

Internationals are different. Something like the World Cup would normally be played during the off season. For friendlies/qualifiers they'll normally have an international break where a week of club football is not played. They'll take the best players from their respective clubs, kind of like in something such as Olympic Hockey or Basketball for example. 

I believe on Sunday there's a Portugal-Serbia qualifier you can watch. Three of our players will be involved (Fonte, Djuricic and Tadic) as well as one of the two best players in the world at the moment, Cristiano Ronaldo.

**-Is there any common sayings/songs/chants I should learn as a Southampton fan?**

The majority of chants in English football tend to be variants on popular songs. When the Saints go marching in is probably the main song. There's a lot of universal football chants in the league that are a variation of the Beach Boy's ""Sloop John B"". 

**-When professing my allegiance, is there a shorter way to abbreviate Southampton? SAFC? Saintsfc?**

If you said you were a Saints fan in England people would probably know what you meant. I know there's an NFL team called the Saints as well so that may get confusing in the US.

**-When buying a jersey do you just buy a plain team jersey with no name? Or do you buy your favorite players jersey and live in fear of them leaving at some point?**

Honestly, I don't think it matters. Someone else has mentioned it's nice to get a player name/number on the back. The kits normally come out a month or so before my birthday so what I normally do is get my surname and then my age that year as the number on the back.

**-Any good videos out there to help me get a better understanding of the sport/a bit of history/etc?**

Here's a good one-off by the BBC on the 50 best World Cup moments. You do admittedly have to put up with Olly Murs however: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvl2uyEyBLo

This video by Ninh Explains should help with the rules of the game. I never really understood how American Football worked until I saw his video on it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg566N-eDWo

As for the whole league/international thing this should help clear that up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ4i3KX2CW4

Equality legislation does not say ""People cannot be offended and have to agree to produce any demand"". There are very specific sections of equality legislation describing things which are inappropriate to discriminate against - gender, disability, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, etc. Moreover, there are numerous exceptions in many of these cases, where distinction on the grounds of one of these characteristics is a fundamental part of the group or business's practice. 

Donaldson's cake doesn't obviously fall under any of these. If he really wanted his cake, he could try and claim they were discriminating against his 'philosophical beliefs', I guess. But the broad equality rules also carry a *specific exception* for ridiculous crowd-baiting positions like Donaldson's, which specifies that the position of the person claiming discrimination must:

&gt; [be worthy of respect in a democratic society, compatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others.](http://www.acas.org.uk/religionorbelief)

I think the Shankill butcher cake clearly fails this test (as well as several others I'm not going to go through here). So, all is right with the world.

The other reason I would object to Donaldson's comparison is the proposed amendment would do nothing in the case of someone asking for a Shankill Butcher cake, as the proposed text of the amendment *exclusively* legislates for discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.

Right.  So you place your trust in the government of the day, a Conservative government no less, to regulate what speech should result in arrest. 

Well, 50 years ago, perhaps promoting homosexuality could have been a punishable offense.  How can you be sure that *anyone* or any government can know what is or isn't bad speech?

I think a lot of this comes down to a fundamental difference in philosophy.  People who are for speech restrictions imagine that opinions must be held in check and regulated.  That, when it comes down to it, that people will revert to bad speech unless they are threatened with punishment.

On the other hand there are people like me who are strongly in favor of free speech.  People who feel that *nobody* can get to have the final say in any debate.  That the only way to sort out good ideas from the bad is to allow free and open exchange of ideas with *nothing* off the table.  That in such an open society that good ideas will eventually win over bad ones.

So which of the two groups is correct?  In the extreme wing of the first group we have Iran, North Korea and every other totalitarian regime.  All of whom tightly regulate speech so that nothing bad can ever be expressed. In the extreme wing of the second group we have the USA, where practically *any* opinion is constitutionally protected by law, even contemptible opinions which would turn the stomach of most regular people.

I know which I prefer and I know which society is better at generating more happiness and more progress for its people.  


&gt;Notably, the police haven't been at your door for using the word ""tranny"".

Well, you're the one who told me that saying 'tranny' should be a hate crime.



&gt;Free speech gives you the right to say those words, but free speech also gives us the right to think you are a bigoted arsehole for using words you know are slurs against minorities.

This was particularly controversial because he had previously flirted with the Labour party whilst a regular Conservative MP, and there's a general feeling on Tory benches that he's only continued the slow defection.    
Cameron has apparently been annoyed at how often he is interrupted // admonished during PMQs, and his ministers have been unhappy with the frequency in which they have been dragged by Bercow into the chamber to answer questions from MPs    
Bercow is particularly adept at yelling at Gove (good), but as Chief Whip he has organised a meeting at 1030am tomorrow, which means that every single Tory MP will be in Parliament for the vote at 1130     
This would make it a seemingly partisan issue, but at the same time the preferred replacement seems to be Lindsay Hoyle, who is actually a Labour MP.        
Hoyle is very competent, it isn't a change I'd oppose personally. I don't mind Bercow, but if Hoyle commands more respect in the Chamber they might be more inclined to listen.

This is how I feel too.

Sturgeon at least tries to articulate her own point of view in a fair and balanced fashion, asks honest questions of her opponents, and actually fights Scotland's corner in doing so.  She also lives a far more grounded and modest lifestyle, choosing to live in a £260k **Glasgow** (she commutes to Edinburgh early doors each day) home that she owns with her husband - no Bute House (Salmond was upgrading an even grander residence prior to stepping down), no chauffeurs, no housekeepers or domestic staff.

Salmond, on the other hand, is just an arrogant, dogmatic pillock who throws around ad hominems, scoffs petty retorts, and just plays a pathetic anti-English blame game.  He is well and truly in it for himself, not to mention he was honestly living like a king while First Minister.

What's more worrying is that Sturgeon was the same until he stepped completely aside, leaving her in charge.

And how did that work out for any revolutionary Marxist movement at any time anywhere?

[From elsewhere on Marxist.com I learn that:](http://www.marxist.com/20th-century-revolutions/)

&gt;For Marxists the Chinese Revolution was the second greatest event in human history, second only to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Millions of human beings, who had hitherto been the beasts of burden of imperialism, threw off the humiliating yoke of imperialism and capitalism, and entered the stage of world history.

And how did that work out for the Marxists?  Good was it?  

Edit:  To be fair, I guess the Chinese did 'enter the stage of world history'.  From [The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html):

&gt;Mao Zedong, founder of the People's Republic of China, qualifies as the greatest mass murderer in world history, an expert who had unprecedented access to official Communist Party archives said yesterday.

&gt;Speaking at The Independent Woodstock Literary Festival, Frank Dikötter, a Hong Kong-based historian, said he found that during the time that Mao was enforcing the Great Leap Forward in 1958, in an effort to catch up with the economy of the Western world, he was responsible for overseeing ""one of the worst catastrophes the world has ever known"".",null,0,null,1427326271,null,0,1427326650,0,cpqsvg0,null,t3_30ay40,null,t1_cpqsvg0,null,t3_30ay40,null,null,null,1432015160,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

The whole point about these clauses is to guarantee fair legal protection for foreign investors and prevent the state from arbitrarily taking over any investor's assets without good reason. If TTIP is passed, of course, there will be investor legal claims against states, I think that's inevitable if we're talking about a trade deal of this size- but I can't see it forcing us to privatise the NHS and costing the taxpayer billions compensating these investors. It would probably be most prudent to look closely at NAFTA to give us some idea of what these investor-state disputes could be like.

The bottom line is basically we should scrutinise the wording of ISDS clauses in this trade deal carefully- it's good to see that investors won't be able to sue for ""lost profits"" caused by government policy changes. But we shouldn't wholesale oppose this treaty deal because of concerns about ISDS clauses- the benefits this trade treaty bring outweigh the risks, and could well be the shot in the arm that the European economy needs to kickstart growth.

I.... What... how on earth did you manage to draw that conclusion from that quote? I said they DON'T just arrest people for making unpopular speech, and you started arguing as if I was saying they do?

&gt; I think a lot of this comes down to a fundamental difference in philosophy. People who are for speech restrictions imagine that opinions must be held in check and regulated. That, when it comes down to it, that people will revert to bad speech unless they are threatened with punishment.

No the philosophy they hold is that people should have the freedom to walk in the streets without being verbally harassed.

&gt; So which of the two groups is correct? In the extreme wing of the first group we have Iran, North Korea and every other totalitarian regime. 

Oh come on, if you're going to play that card, you know the immediate counter is to invoke Godwin's law by pointing out that the Nazis are an example of free speech being taken to the extreme.

The course is enjoyable in the first year - take the time to figure out what subjects you enjoy as most people decide to specialize in a branch of Engineering that they didn't originally think they would when starting at Cambridge.

My advice would be to try and understand the material as you go along. People who don't go to lectures tend to get behind on the course, and as a result struggle in exam term.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"Having experienced healthcare elsewhere I can see there is a particularly malignant 1950s ethos in the NHS that i'd like to see vanish. It probably harks back to the post-war origins of the organisation. What I mean is quite often inadequacy or outdated practices are accepted on the basis of a sort of ""keep calm and carry on"", ""stiff upper lip"", ""do your best"" type of thinking. Honestly, the only place that mentality belongs is back in 1947. It's the 21st century now, we are a wealthy country and if we want good quality healthcare we ought to have it.  Take the food for example; usually viciously unhealthy, produced from microwaves by the cheapest outsourced company.

In Belgium when you go into hospital it's a bit like a hotel... some services are the same no matter what you pay, like the clean sheets. But other things are based on what you pay, like the size of the room, the number of TV channels etc. There is no reason why the NHS couldn't work like this. The NHS would be the state provider, but the hospital it's based in would not be. You could choose if you want the basic microwave meals or the nice cooked-on-site stuff. You could choose to have a private room, or a shared room. The quality of the care, just like the quality of the hotels sheets, would be the same. Doctors would come around and see you just as much no matter what you pay, they'd give you the same medicines and you'd get the same quality of nursing care. The difference is you wouldn't have to swallow what the NHS gives you in terms of quality of service.

You could pay to have better. There's no reason why, if your doctor thinks you can wait 2 weeks for your MRI, you couldn't pay to expedite it instead simply to be out of hospital sooner. It would be up to you. If your job earns you £1000 a week then paying £500 to bring an MRI forward 2 weeks to get out of hospital might financially make sense to you and its a wise investment. The benefit is the hospital, as a provider, can then use the margins on that to buy more MRI scanners, employ more doctors and nurses and improve their service **for everyone**. There is nothing dark or dirty about it. The healthcare staff would advise you on what is clinically important. You could decide on the rest. It would empower patients rather than disempower them like the NHS does.

Unfortunately we have a thought process that private healthcare = US private healthcare. The US is the exception, not the rule. Most western European countries have systems like I describe above.

Trains are expensive unless you book in advance (and often even then).

No, I'm saying that if you think it's OK for the government to regulate hate speech then you have to put your trust in the government to decide which speech constitutes hatred.  You may think they've done an OK job so far, but how can you be sure that they will continue to make the right decision?  What about if Farage became part of the next government?

&gt;No the philosophy they hold is that people should have the freedom to walk in the streets without being verbally harassed.

I think I'm tired of saying this - but I'm not in favor of anyone harassing others with speech.  In fact, I think that there could be a case for treating the most extreme 'in your face' harassment scenarios as crimes.  But, more because of the harassment aspect and not the content of the speech itself.  (You could harass people by screaming 'HAVE A NICE DAY' if you so chose.)

So yes, people should have the freedom to walk the streets without facing undue harassment.  But what about the rest of our speech?  Should I have the freedom to talk about 'trannies' in public?  As long as I'm not accosting people and cornering them or otherwise forcing them to listen to my speech then I think I should.  

&gt;Oh come on, if you're going to play that card, you know the immediate counter is to invoke Godwin's law by pointing out that the Nazis are an example of free speech being taken to the extreme.

But totalitarianism *is* the end result of severely restricting people's speech.  This is why free-speech is such a big deal.  

&gt;Because you're making an entire argument about people being arrested for using slurs, when no-one has ever argued that, only that verbal harassment is a crime.

But that is what hate speech laws do.  It's not just verbal harassment.  It's criminalizing the content of the speech, no matter if they're used to intimidate people or not.

For instance remember signing back on after finishing a training course and I asked my advisor if the telephone number written on her telephone was hers, she said they're not supposed to give out their desk telephone numbers but if i was to note it down she wouldn't say anything- getting an advisors contact details is the first piece of advice i'd give to a new jobseeker. 

I just do a bit of job-seeking related activity each day, fill out the form as you say and turn up on time to sign on appointments. It can be a pain if you need to re-schedule on short notice, but I now know to immediately get hold of my advisor's contact details if I'm to sign back on again.

We haven't had a wonder kid that stood heads and shoulders above his age group for sometime. This obsession of wanting to field youngsters regardless of their talent is getting out of hand. Jose can't play them just to please the fans. Last season, we were a team that was being rebuilt and a new balanced system was introduced. He had no time to play youngsters. This is only his second season at Chelsea since he came back. In his previous era, he was brought in to win trophies. Not to promote youngsters. We all know you can't win major trophies with youngsters. It took us more than a decade, but i believe their time is coming soon. I don't understand why you would just assume he will do the same thing he did a while ago. He has grown as a manager and Chelsea approach has dramatically changed for the better. We have been signing players for the future. He is building something that will last a long time and doing that will enable him to promote the youngsters from our academy. Who knew Zouma would be playing all these big matches in his 1st season at Chelsea? How many title contenders are fielding young defenders in big matches? I know he is not academy player, but he is only 20 years old. Also don't get me wrong, we all want to see youngsters from the academy playing for us. Ake is a good player, but do we even know which position he is best suited to play at? He was also injured when he had the limited opportunity to play in the first rounds of Capitol one Cup and The FA cup. If this was Ruben, it might have been a different case. He is more polished and looks like a player that has a legitimate chance of getting some serious minutes soon. Hopefully, we will be in a pole position to seal the title with few matches to play. And Jose would have his chance to play them. We can't take that risk now. No other title contenders are doing so and we are no different.

In general, I'd suggest not worrying too much and not to overthink it. Focus on being the kind of person women want to date, rather than applying a formula to *get* women to date you. If you do like someone, just let them know. Getting turned down isn't the end of the world, after all.

As for what to do if she says yes, well it depends a lot on her as an individual. Do you have any shared interests you can do together? The trick for informal dates is to pick some kind of activity where you can chat, but it isn't horribly awkward if conversation dies down for a bit.

In my personal opinion, going to the cinema is OK if you do something else afterwards. You tend to sit through a film in silence, so it's no good on its own, but it gives you an easy topic for conversation later on.

It would remain entirely free at the point of service. National Insurance payments would essentially be what they were meant to be - an insurance system.

The difference is you could opt out of it and instead pay a private provider who would cover you for an enhanced package if you wanted... the clinical care would be identical (since it has to be by law) but the difference would be the facilities. The basis for it is already in effect. That is why when you go to the ultra-modern [Queen Elizabeth Hospital](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Queen_Elizabeth_Hospital_Birmingham,_Edgbaston,_Birmingham,_England-7March2011.jpg) in Birmingham your facilities are nicer than the rather crumbly and outdated [Royal Sussex County Hospital](http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/02/58/17/2581709_8f88fed3.jpg)... but the quality of the care is every bit as good.

You'd be paying for nicer food, nicer rooms with fewer people sharing them. You'd also have the option to expedite non-essential services (e.g. an MRI scan to check for a knee injury which might require elective surgery down the line). Obviously if you're in an accident and your knee requires urgent surgery it'll happen urgently irrespective of what package you have paid into.

Some providers might go further and include things like screening packages, e.g. retinal screening, diabetes screening, genetic testing etc.

When you think about it, the purpose is really to extract more money from those who can **and want to** pay more. That money then helps everyone by buying better equipment and services.

And speech is *not* violence.  You're the one who used the term 'hate crime', so perhaps you'd like to comment on that.

As I said - I think shouting *anything* at people is wrong and in severe cases should be an offense.  But it's not so much the precise words being used.  It's the fact that it's harassment in which the other person has no choice whether to engage you or not.

&gt; A man was bullying Bob's girlfriend and her mother who live alone, with physical acts of damage to abusive language.  
  
OK, so which one lives alone? The girlfriend or the girlfriend's mother?  


&gt; Upon confronting the man it resulted in him shouting at Bob, Bob shouting back and the man attacking Bob's friend.  
  
Is this Bob's friend the same person as Bob's girlfriend, or is this some other person who either happened to be there, or who came along to help confront the man?  
&gt; Bob broke up the fight, Bob and friend went to police station to report assault, were arrested for ABH. Bob admitted shouting back at the man, and swearing.
  
ABH? That's not the Public Order Act, that's the [Offences Against The Person Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/47). Who was arrested? Bob and friend, or just Bob, or just Friend - or was it ""the man""?  (OK, so reading further down, I now know it wasn't ""the man"").
&gt; Bailed twice for ""identity issues"", on 3rd return charged with Section 4(1) and (4) of the public order act 1986.  

So that's basically being charged with threatening violence.  

&gt; Is this a means of Bob's friend's attacker not getting charged? The police have made no effort at any point to contact Bob's witnesses or to arrest Bob's friends attacker. Not sure on what is happening here!  
  
It sounds like the police aren't pursuing that matter. If the crime has been reported (as you suggested), have they given you a reference or crime number? Have you tried asking for an update on this report? If not, ask *politely*, and ideally not while you're being questioned in relation to the charges you face.  
  
Have Bob's girlfriend, or the girlfriend's mother made any complaints to the police about this man who was bullying them? If so, get details (dates, collar numbers, reference numbers, any correspondence with the police). Were any of these complaints followed up?

The French have been electing National Front candidates for quite a while, does this mean that FPTP (with a run off) can't be used either?

The assertion I questioned was ""PR will always give extreme and fringe groups more power - PR will get racists positions of power in this country."" Citing one example of an extremist party winning a few seats (from c. 7% of the vote) in a country that uses PR hardly proves that universal claim. 

&gt; I do think PR is a fairer system than FPTP, but you have to accept that you will have a few extremists being elected and be able to work around them.

Also, the decision to sign older players such as Navas and Fernando was very deliberate. Begiristain and Pellegrini *wanted* these players to be getting on in years right about this time specifically because it would allow youth players to come through right now, and soon we'll start to see that. Lopes and Denayer are likely to see time with the first team next year, potentially Pozo and Rekik as well. We'll also see a lot of younger players come in from other clubs as well.

All clubs go through this sort of transition, it has absolutely nothing to do with Pellegrini and everything to do with Begiristain and Soriano's long term plan. It is a difficult thing for a Manager to execute, but I am confident in Pellegrini's ability. Nothing is certain of course, but I really rate Pellegrini alongside anyone else we could reasonably get. The only managers out there right now who would potentially be an upgrade are Mourinho, Ancelotti, Pep, Simeone, and maybe Klopp. Mourinho would never happen, Pep is highly unlikely to  happen within the next five years I'd say, and Simeone just signed a new contract. Klopp, I believe, has also said he's not going anywhere. That leaves Ancelotti, who is in all honestly a pretty similar coach to Pellegrini in many respects, as has been discussed elsewhere, and I actually prefer Pellegrini's approach from a spectators perspective.

Here's why. Aside from the Mirallas sale, which better bring a nice return, we have Europa money coming through, continued increase in revenue from the recently renewed Chang sponsorship, and a hell of a lot of money from the Premier League TV deals. 

The Premier League on the whole is flush with cash. [Premier League clubs combined are in the black for the first time in 15 years](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/premier-league-back-black-tv-cash-rolls-000457715--sow.html). Everton are the [20th richest team *in all of Europe*](http://www.businessinsider.com/premier-league-revenues-2015-2) in terms of revenue. Last year, Cardiff the bottom club in the PL [made more in TV revenue than the previous year's league champions Manchester United](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/10830916/Premier-League-clubs-earn-record-breaking-sums-thanks-to-TV-bonanza.html). And TV rights were just renegotiated for the next three years. Oh...and international rights have yet to be negotiated-- and let me tell you there will be a bidding war for those rights in the United States. [One estimate says](http://www.businessinsider.com/premier-league-broadcast-money-2015-2) that the bottom EPL club will earn more from TV revenue than what the 25th richest European club made in all revenue combined last year. 

So maybe it'll still be hard to compete with the oil clubs at the top of the table. But we should not be losing out to other European teams for players, and we should feel no compulsion to sell players.

&gt;Beginning in Rangoon (referred to often as Yangon - it's modern name), the old capital city of Burma the presenters are told to meet up in the People's Square opposite the Shwedagon Pagoda. Jeremy is the first to arrive in what he dubs the 'sports lorry', a yellow Isuzu built around 1959. The next to arrive is James, in the what is the smallest of the three, leading Jeremy to mock it as a van. James' lorry has a crane attachment on the back, which he later puts to good use. Jeremy demonstrates his speaker system to James while they wait for Richard and justifys why he is wearing a tie saying ""because I am a modern lorry driver and modern lorry drivers are crisp and sharp. The days are over when you simply turned up with a glove box full of strong pornography and egg on your vest"". Hammond then arrives at the Square with ""a glovebox full of strong pornography and egg on his vest"". Hammond's truck is mocked for it's size and for being a Hindu temple by James. The presenters also critizes his seat which Jeremy likens to a church pew. Jeremy also suggest that as Hammond's lorry was originally a farm truck it was used for transporting heroin in the Golden Triangle. The presenters then formally receive their challenge. They are tasked with building a bridge that is strong enough to support the weight of their lorries over the River Kwai in Thailand.

What you quote are junk stats. Note how the ""number of accidents"" isn't qualified with anything like ""per passenger mile"". These numbers are utterly worthless as there are vastly more people are on the roads during those hours than there are in the morning. There are many ""after-school clubs"" as well as going shopping, to the movies and about a million and one extra activities *that only take place in the evening*.

It's like saying ""more car accidents happen when more people drive"". No shit, Sherlock! THere is absolutely nothing in that PDF to indicate that there is any increase due to DST, something that would trivial to include by simply looking at a later month in the year. The fact that this is omitted is a clear red flag. All they'd have to say is something like ""yet in April, when it's lighter, there are X less accidents"". They aren't stupid people so this was omitted for a reason. I'm not even going to bother to check the stats because imho it's fairly clear why there was no mention of it. ""Lies, damned lies and statistics"" really needs to be appended with ""and the worst of all, omissions"".

&gt;The __Professional Footballers' Association Young Player of the Year__ (often called the __PFA Young Player of the Year__, or simply the __Young Player of the Year__) is an annual award given to the player aged 23 or under at the start of the season who is adjudged to have been the best of the season in [English football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England).  The award has been presented since the [1973–74](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%E2%80%9374_in_English_football) season and the winner is chosen by a vote amongst the members of the players' [trade union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union), the [Professional Footballers' Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Footballers%27_Association) (PFA). The first winner of the award was [Ipswich Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Town_F.C.) defender [Kevin Beattie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Beattie). The current holder is [Eden Hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Hazard), who won the award for his performances throughout the 2013–14 campaign for [Chelsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.).

The man even has his arms crossed in a passive/defensive stance. The cop may be technically justified in pepper spraying this guy, he might not I don't know I am not a lawyer, but form a moral point of view it is clearly and excess of force. The cop could have handled that situation much better and without perpetuating the idea that the police (the met in particular) are just another gang of thugs in a different uniform. Look at how the bystander react to the violence, are these people going to go away with a positive image of the police in their mind? fuck no and I don't blame them. It is in the policies best interest to have the goodwill and respect of the people or they will end up working in a hostile environment which will just lead to a cycle of violence from both police and civilians.

As a side note I think a lot of people underestimate how painful pepper spray is. It fucking hurts, it makes you go temporarily blind, it disorientates you, it really fucking hurts. Like getting spice in your eye, X100 the amount, fired at you from a compressed can. On a sheer pain scale I would much rather be punched than pepper sprayed.

null,false,Mr__Random,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"So there was no other possible solution to that video than to pepper spray the guy in the face? really? Pepper spray is not trivial, it hurts a huge amount, it attacks a persons sinuses and it temporarily blinds people, it should not be used lightly. If you have ever got a small bit of chili in your eye it hurts like the buggery, so imagine that but 100X the volume being fired at you from a pressurised can. Its not a harmless experience. The only reason the guy was not badly hurt was because the cop hit his cheek not his eyes. 

Moreover pepper spraying in that scenario whether it was technically allowed is clearly a bad tactic. The guy is more committed to resisting after the spraying, because if someone is attacking you it is natural to resist, you are already taking a beating so natural instinct kicks in and you fight back harder. Also the crowd around the scene are more sympathetic to the guy and more angry at the policeman because they see the spraying as an excess use of force. The people seeing that live go away with a hostile attitude towards policemen which will make the policemans work environment harder and more stressful to work in. It is hard to do community police work when members of the the community see you as a dangerous and thuggish. I'd be willing to bet that if the policeman had used more restrained methods or even just waited for back up the situation could have been diffused rather than escalated.

The guy was of no danger to the officer or to the general public. The policemans decision to pepper spray the man was an excess use of force, and we should not allow the relationship between the police and general public to deteriorate because policemen are happy to pepper spray the shit out of anyone who resists arrest regardless of the scenario.

Its not as simple as man resists arrest = out with the pepper spray!",null,0,null,1427335215,null,0,1427335584,0,cpqxyfa,null,t3_308s10,null,t1_cpqxyfa,null,t1_cpq6pcv,null,null,null,1432017567,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Bale is in the news for playing like crap, being selfish, and not knowing Spanish. All good reasons for being sold. However the bookies are not slashing odds because his move is imminent.

What has happened here is that the bookies realize that the biggest newspaper story in European sports at the moment is Bale, and if there is a big story, about anything, in sports--money is to be made for betting companies. 

Bookies have secondary interest in whether a bet wins or don't win, the primary interest they have is in maximizing the number of people putting money down. The reason they are slashing the odds here is because not enough people are putting money down on Bale moving yet. They gotta make the bet more tempting. This is not done by ""upping"" the odds, it is done by making the bet look ""likely"".

Markovic is nowhere near the finished article yet, he doesn't have the passing abilities or decision making that Sterling has and he doesn't seem confident on the ball most of the time for whatever reason.. playing as wingback for half  the season probably isn't helping that at all.

Lallana is alright, has a few off games where he doesn't contribute much but he has had too many injury issues this season.. Sterling has played double the amount of minutes that Lallana has this season and I think that should be taken into consideration when comparing players.

I understand why you might feel that India wouldn't work as part of an open  immigration policy though.

IMO open borders policies only really work where an equal number of people are likely to want to migrate both ways. This would likely be the case between Aus/Canada/UK/NZ, but not so much when India, Pakistan, etc. are included.

My reasoning is that if you have vastly different economic situations on each side PLUS uncontrolled migration you'll tend to end up with a massive labour/brain drain from the poorer country as the young folks go off to seek their fortunes elsewhere. The older guys left behind then have far less people to pay their pensions, etc. This puts more of an onus on those youngsters who *are* left, which in-turn worsens the poverty situation causing a vicious circle of mass migration. 

The countries these migrants move to may not be prepared to handle the influx either.

This is why I feel the EU's open-border's policy used to work fine when the number of members was smaller and migration was mutual but now could end up ultimately harming the poorer countries of the union.

They said it was OK because he *didn't* say it on TV. It's also nonsense to claim that Clarkson gets away with stuff when he doesn't given that Boyle was reprimanded multiple times by ofcom for offensive jokes and it took him a VERY long time to get sacked from mock the week.

Also a bit weird that he's pretending that his jokes are ok because they make you think or that they contain some deep political message.

“Pistorius to me sounds like a spell Harry Potter would say to make your legs drop off.”

“30 years since the Falklands War and Simon Weston doesn’t seem to have aged a day” (simon weston being the veteran of the falklands war with horrific facial burning)

He said Camilla Parker Bowles was ""what Princess Diana would look like if she survived the crash""

He also made a joke about Jordan's mentally disabled son that implied that because he had mental problems he probably raped his mother.

His justification is BS and pretty cowardly to be honest. He wants to make jokes as offensive, if not more so than Clarkson's, but he's too afraid to face the fallout so he creates a bullshit back justification so he can have his cake and eat it. It's probably after he fought a libel case against the daily mirror calling him racist for using the words Nigger and Paki in jokes.

If you are better than the stature of the league, you should play elsewhere. It is what is best for your development and your career. I don't think MLS (or the English Leagues, for that matter) should be where anyone maxes out. Strive for greatness. Don't strive for ""good enough to play in the Championship"" or ""good enough to play in MLS"".

Bedoya is an excellent example from the US. He is playing in Ligue 1 and is getting to face tougher competition than he would in MLS. If Bedoya were English (Alejandro Bedford), he would be a fringe BPLer or a top-end Championship player. Ligue 1 is a good league for his talent level and it will make him better. English players should view it the same way.

Instead you get English players who just spend their career in the Championship and now Americans spending their careers in MLS. If you have the talent to play in a better league, play in a better league.

Michael Bradley playing in MLS in his prime frustrates me. He is a better player than MLS.

Don't get me wrong, I want MLS to get better. But players need to do what is best for their careers/development.

From the comments section:

Chris9743:

The following sentence by ""The TUV leader"" re ""heart of darkness"" is more accurate than he knows; but  not in the way he meant it. The TUV leader added: ""This latest revelation is yet another reminder of the peace process's ""heart of darkness"".

The ""heart of darkness"" in the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) was in its transfer to Britain of Ireland's disputed Six-Counties (with its $billions of offshore hydrocarbon riches) and the amnesty granted exclusively for those ""republicans"" who led that sell-out for MI5. 

To see why American Neo-Cons promoted the GFA see page 450 in Voices From the Grave. In it David Ervine describes his visit to the White House where he wrongfully accused the U.S. of supporting the IRA. Ervine quotes the response from the Head of State Dept's Britain Desk; ""The IRA don't have Buccaneer bombers, they don't have aircraft carriers, and we (the US) need to sew up Britain's Exchequer and free up Britain's military for use in our upcoming wars."" And we all looked at him; and he continued; ""Against Islamic fundamentalism."" 

The GFA was passed, and Britain's Exchequer was sewn up, its military were freed up from the Six Counties to become the New-Con's indispensable accomplices in one of history's greatest crimes; the attack upon, and destruction of, Iraq. Britain's torturers of Long Kesh got jobs in Abu Ghraib and other ""black sites.'' Its p.r. experts became experts telling American TV viewers how to defeat ""terrorism"" in Iraq and elsewhere.

I think that's what Boyle is saying in this clip. 

Personally, I agree with him. Boyle is deeply, brutally satirical, as well as being a professional comedian - Clarkson's jokes have significantly less substance than Boyle's and he is not a professional comedian.

Why is it organised like this? Because as a BBC employee, even one of their top-paid stars, Jeremy Clarkson would make well under a million pounds a year.
