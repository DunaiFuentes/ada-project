null,false,MrLiamD,newcr-6,,null,"Remy, Salah and Chicha are all getting offers from fairly safe Champions League teams and much richer teams than us, they're looking for playing time but at ""lower"" teams than the elite, but that are still wealthy and in the CL. It's simple really, only scousers care about Everton's history as a reason for picking to play for them. You can't blame anyone for going to a better team, with a better chance of Champions League and more money when they have no connection to the club. Plus, personally I'd rather have Deulofeu for £2.2m than any of those you listed for upwards of £10m. He's younger, cheaper, has a higher ceiling and we need a striker but we need someone like him more. 

This was a great bit of business and we've got our top two targets two summers in a row. We still have money and could make a couple of great signings. The fact of the matter is until we get Champions League football and/or money we lose the two major draws and we can't help that. The way to get Champions League football on our budget is to get players the Champions League teams aren't looking at or value playing time more than money and CL which is rare for a top player as they'd probably get into the team they're moving to.

my gear list for reference :-
[helmet](http://www.jsaccessories.co.uk/is-17-helmet-matt-black.html) good, anti-fog shield, sun visor  
[boots](http://www.jsaccessories.co.uk/s-mx-1-1-boots-black-red.html) alright, nice boot, see below  
[jacket](http://www.jsaccessories.co.uk/ixs-exeter-jacket-black-blue-3968.html) really nice jacket (my favourite part of my gear) really light when thermals are out and really warm when there in.  
[gloves] (http://www.jsaccessories.co.uk/h20132-aqua-strada-glove-black.html) cant say i particularity enjoy these, they were the only one that i could find with a good fit, had them for 2 years and holding up alright though.  
[trousers] (http://www.jsaccessories.co.uk/j-s-challenger-trousers-1065-black-3854.html)  alright set, i thought i would scrap them and get a set of kevlar jeans but i'm still using them, however i think i'll get a set of jeans in july when it gets roasting 

had all these for best part of a year (apart from gloves which as i said had for 2 years) boots let water in which is a absolute nightmare but i think that's because i prefer to wear the trousers inside my boot and it creeps inside where the boot flares out, you might not have that problem though.

&gt;Silly strawman. As stated the employers hosting such workers do retain full time employees. Such savings on employees would allow the company to expand (and hire more people!) But whatever ""ooga booga capitalists"".

Having worked (paid) for more than one company who hires workfare, they absolutely *do* do it for the free grunt labour (and £xxx DWP kickback per placement that comes with it).

&gt;Work placement will be an opportunity to pad out that CV and make some vital contacts.

Hahahaha. Don't make me laugh. Vital contacts in a FTSE 100 company or charity shop isn't going to happen, ever. Works for SMB's, sure, but little to no SMBs take on workfare placements.

Great many people on workfare already have perfectly adequate CVs, there are many other factors involved that you haven't considered.

* Extrapolating the figures, Christians outnumber non religious by a bit over 5.3 to 1 in the age groups 50+. In the age groups below 50, that drops to a little over 1.65 to 1. It's lower still in the under 24s.

Regarding the replaced faceplate - it was not replaced by BT, we replaced it ourselves as earlier mentioned with regards to how long it took them to reply to callout of no phone/internet at all, we were better off doing the repairs ourselves with some basic knowledge on the subject. There was no change in speed before or after the lightning strike, so even if a BT engineer personally replaced it, it wouldn't have made any difference. I haven't unscrewed the plate to see if there is a test socket yet, I am not sure we have one though as I can't recall there being one off top of my head from the last time the box socket was opened up.

I haven't tried fiddling with the router yet, I am weary of potentially mucking it all up and losing access completely as happened not too long ago. 

Regarding line length: the lines going from the house down to the village's cabinet itself (if that isn't the exchange as I'd previously thought it was) is about a quarter mile-half mile distance or so - would that be deemed 'too long' and thus doomed to have poor speeds?

7 megabytes per second is what the TalkTalk engineer quoted when I asked him, what we were supposed to be getting, but I highly doubt that. Megabits as you say is the correct term I believe. Our maximum best ever I've ever seen it go up to is about 600 kb/s - that's only during very late nights and early mornings, somewhere between midnight and 9am. From 10am - 4pm we get an average (if we're lucky) of about 300 kb/s at best/maximum. From 4pm - 6pm, it drops to about 180 kb/s best/maximum, and then from 6pm - 11pm/midnight it can drop very hard, with a measly 20 kb/s average being our best/maximum.

Our neighbour from my understanding is boasting 1 megabyte a second, apparently definetly not megabit - they're connection is much faster than ours and stable, despite same distance/lines used. Though I haven't personally seen their numbers, only what they've said upon inquiring, I'd estimate that they have what we have as our best at all times, so 600 - 1000 kb/s-ish steady, with no complaints from them on whether they've had struggles with it or not. They seem quite happy actually with their speeds. They must be quite familiar and content with the speeds as they regularly run businesses on the internet compared to us, who use it for casual/leisurely use and online gaming/streaming etc.

To add, if it's relevant/helpful at all, our upload speed is significantly lower than our download speed of 600kb/s. I don't think we've ever had anywhere near 100 for uploading, it's always been &lt;50 or even &lt;30 last I recall. I could do a speed test using the Ookla site for a more accurate set of numbers though.

The one you missed, though I gather it's harder now is Disability, I've known a few people off work for ""depression"" (as a depressive who has worked almost every day of his adult life I have an issue with this. It can be debilitating, but it's not a reason not to work in all but the most severe cases) or ""a bad back"" though they seem decent enough. I'd guess Atos has put a stop to this from what you hear about them.

Also of course: illegal income. Most people I know on long term benefits grow and/or sell weed. Lots of people do cash in hand: security, man and a van/odd job man stuff, mechanics, that sort of thing.

I'm in a very similar position to OP's parents. Bought a house at the wrong time and had unforeseen issues at work and here we are. Though I have a lot nicer stuff than those around us and I imagine go on more holidays, etc.

On the flip side, I know people (sometimes the same people described above, often not) who struggle to keep the lights on and food in the cupboard on benefits. I know a single mum of 2 who only heats the bedrooms in winter and basically shuts off the downstairs. I know people who eat once a day and so on.

It's a tough one. It's hard to have a system that only lets through people in genuine need without treating those people like shit.

I would say that, much like the furore over public sector pensions, this is the anger is misplaced.

Dear.......,
 
 Thanks for your message. 
 
 I agree that the First Past The Post system is no longer suitable in the UK especially as we see an increase in multi-party politics. However we must get a consensus on this as the last 
 referendum on the Alternative Vote system was overwhelmingly rejected by the electorate.
 
 It simply cannot be right or sustainable that the SNP secured 50% of the vote and 95% of the seats in Scotland. The system has to change, and I will soon be meeting with the Chief Executive of the Electoral Reform Society, to explore options for re-launching the campaign on this issue.

Hey Stephen,

I appreciate your reply and I'm glad that at the very least it's being acknowledged. You may want to keep in mind Single Transferable Vote which, in my opinion is the best choice.

As to the AV referendum, unfortunately at the time I was too young to vote but research into the area seemed that the referendum itself was a bit of a mess.
To begin with voters were offered a voting system that the majority of the public did not understand and those who did would have preferred a different voting system. Also if you were to google AV referendum 2011 posters and look at the images the Conservatives went to great and somewhat appalling lengths to keep the current voting system. The ""No"" campaign had far more funding due to the Tories and the ""Yes"" campaign was split due to wanting a different voting system. 

So if a Tory MP ever mentions how the public did not want to change the voting system, point him/her towards the appalling campaign that they had against the referendum.

I appreciate your reply and I'm glad that steps are being taken to fix the broken and outdated voting system.

Yours sincerely,

You seem to imagine that running a football club is hugely different from running any other company. Yet the head of Barca (Bartomeu) has a background in airport engineering and no other sporting club experience. The head of Juve (Agnelli) has a background in cars and Philip Morris, and no other sporting club experience. The head of Bayern Munich (Hopfner) was also in industry before joining Bayern and had no previous sporting club experience. And the head of Real Madrid (Perez) is a construction magnate with no other sporting club involvement. So thats your champions league semi-finalists. All with very different backgrounds in industry, and zero sporting experience before getting involved with their current club. Maybe you think there's a secret stock of ex-footballers with MBA's and significant directorship experience that should be in charge of Liverpool or something. Your line of string-of-shite arguments don't really follow much logic so its hard to make out exactly. Whats best practice for the biggest clubs in Europe doesn't seem acceptable to a renowned expert such as yourself. 

So there's two possibilities with these people. (1) They carry the same management principles they successfully used in their days in industry with them, and so make short, medium and long term investments. (2) They throw that all out the window, and just care about tomorrow. So which is it?. Well I'll leave it to you to investigate how they all continuously sign up talent of ages from 12-22 as early as they can they can, but since you don't seem to handle normal reasoning quite well its option (1). See Juve having 40 kids out on loan, Barca banned for signing foreign youngsters too young, Real being investigated for same, and Bayern signing the best Germans available, eg Emre Can at 16/17.

Does FSG's experience in other sports (yankee bat indeed - you made an attempted funny) give them an advantage?. Probably yes, as there are concepts in other sports that can be applied to football that haven't been applied up to now. Even if it doesn't, it is any disadvantage?. No, well other than in your world of makey up logic. Maybe you think they're going to make LFC players use baseball bats or something. 

And as for the constant wailing about ending up in mid-table. I'm not sure where its coming from. I'm guessing you're spending too much time away from your natural habitat of hanging off your mothers tit and so its just a cry for attention, but in case you haven't noticed we've just gone through a season where practically everything that could go wrong did go wrong and we've still finished 6th. Its been deemed not good and heads have rolled as a result. Yet you think we're going to be allowed fall back to mid table on a consistent basis?.  There's not a chance that would be accepted. 

So continue on wailing away like a banshee on here about how those in control of the club are clueless, its obvious from how you're constantly downvoted on here that practically everyone finds your opinion as laughably stupid as I do. This lad will be signed and will do well or do badly, but either way the policy will continue.

null,false,FrankDelano,null,null,null,"He was never a fullback until Rodgers put him there. I never understood it. He was a dominant center half both at the club level and the International level as a youth player. He has the physical attributes, and now the skill on the ball, to be a dominant center half at the first team level. With the struggles that we've had with the defensive line it makes no sense not to give him a chance in his natural position. Especially if we're going to play a three center half formation, which will almost certainly have to be the case if we end up with Moreno and Clyne as fullbacks and keep Skrtel. Wisdom has practically been groomed for the RCB position in the formation that we used for most of last season.


I don't trust Rodgers' judgement at all when it comes to defenders though. I've never understood what he looks for or how he identifies talent/leadership/ability. He forced out Agger, who probably should have been kept as the anchor to build the defensive line around, clearly does not favor Lucas, who singlehandedly solidifies both the defensive and midfield lines, and spent 20m on Lovren, whose struggles we're all familiar with. 

Bottom line, I think Wisdom deserves a chance to play his natural position at the first team level, but I doubt it will happen under Rodgers and I'm not sure that playing under him at all would be good for Wisdom's development.

In my post though, I was referring to the UK and other western countries - the fact is that the more radical elements of the Muslim communities just so happen to be considered as having a high proportion of people living in, if not poverty conditions, then very low income conditions. They are often communities that are heavily neglected by councils and government. As such, the people there will often feel the UK government is either neglecting them it actively trying to marginalize them. They are prime targets for radicalisation. 

Of course it's not universal across the world. But in the UK it is possible that this is why you see so many willing to renounce British values. In the middle east, you have mostly Islamic governments, so the narrative is different. ISIS clearly isn't simply filled with low educated people, the people in charge are dangerously competent. They know the best way to gain recruits - by encouraging those living in the west to feel they are being marginalised and treated like criminals by their home governments and people. It's standard propaganda - play on people's fears to make the people believe your narrative.

The radical clerics are part of this, they know the communities they preach to are easy targets. They use their influence to encourage people to think the western government is the reason for all their problems and that joining ISIS will fix the problem.

Regarding ISIS itself, pan-Islamism is a very common theme in the Islamic world. ISIS is the most noticeable as it is the one taking the most extreme measures to make a united Islamic state happen. Pan-Islamic groups are rather broad, from groups like the Taliban and ISIS, to those engaging in more IRA style tactics, to the moderates who simply want their own Islamic version of the EU.

&gt;

&gt;__Condorcet's jury theorem__ is a [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science) theorem about the relative probability of a given group of individuals arriving at a correct decision. The theorem was first expressed by the [Marquis de Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Condorcet) in his 1785 work *Essay on the Application of Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions*. 

&gt;The assumptions of the simplest version of the theorem are that a group wishes to reach a decision by majority vote. One of the two outcomes of the vote is *correct*, and each voter has an independent probability *p* of voting for the correct decision. The theorem asks how many voters we should include in the group. The result depends on whether *p* is greater than or less than 1/2:

&gt;


&gt;* If *p* is greater than 1/2 (each voter is more likely to vote correctly), then adding more voters increases the probability that the majority decision is correct. In the limit, the probability that the majority votes correctly approaches 1 as the number of voters increases.

&gt;* On the other hand, if *p* is less than 1/2 (each voter is more likely than not to vote incorrectly), then adding more voters makes things worse: the optimal jury consists of a single voter.

null,false,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"I think he can be incredibly poor tactically. Last season was a showcase of his stubbornness to adapt his team. 

Tactically we were set up awfully for 3 months. A non-existent attacking threat of passing it between our defenders and getting steam rolled by the likes of QPR (which we absolutely fluked 3 points from) and left our defense completely exposed to any team with pace. He left Gerrard to protect them, when he was clearly being targeted and was a glaring weak spot. The obvious answer was sat on the bench 2 feet from him in Lucas, but he persisted with the same inane tactics for **three** months. 

By this point we were fucking miles off the top four and rooted to about tenth. As the threat of losing his job loomed over his head (he's admitted this) he decided he'd try to shake things up...Finally! Madness ensued. We won games, we played good football, good times were had. We got ourselves within reach of the top four and the ever faltering and stuttering united of this season.

Problem is, teams have now had 12 games looking at us and how we play and figuring out methods to shut it down. Swansea warned us, and we scraped through. 

We then faced United, and were destroyed. Rodgers still not seeing that this new tactic had been found out then took the exact same approach again to face Arsenal. We were destroyed agaaaain.

At this point he decided it wasn't worth adapting again and went back to the same tactics which had fucked over our first 3 months. Just in time for an FA cup sem-final. 

That was a joy to behold. Switching formations 3-4 times in the same game, starting Gerrard despite him being a target-able weakness, keeping Gerrard on the ENTIRE game when he had been abysmal, and only bringing on Lambert with 3 minutes to go. 

It truly was a master class of shitting the bed. 

This has left out the utterly embarrassing performances in the champions league which we've waited years to be back in.  

Yes we had some striker woes, but fucking hell our squad could have been managed a lot better. When managed correctly we went on was it a 10 game unbeaten run? We had enough quality to do much better than we did. 

Rodgers couldn't get the players to perform against United (this fucks me off, never have I seen a performance against them as shit as the one at Anfield this season, we rolled on our backs and let them fuck fourth place out of us on our own soil. Gutless.) He couldn't get them fired up to stay in the champions league, he couldn't get them fired up for an FA cup semi and lastly he couldn't get them to send one of the biggest fucking legends this club will ever see off. 

We lost to Palace at home 3-1 deservedly on his last home game, and 6 fucking 1 to Stoke on Stevie's last ever game. Abysmal. 

I don't like his media antics. He's a PR nightmare, I don't believe in him tactically, I don't think he can take the club any further without us magically unearthing some god send like Suarez. He has no respect for defense like, at all. Lucas is a fucking treasure right now, and when he plays we actually stand a chance of not being overrun and keeping a clean sheet, but Rodgers is adamant to see him sold and replaced with more 5'2 technical players that have no clue how to break up attacks, but can do some nice turns and pass to the side.

**THESE ELECTION RESULTS WERE NOT THE WORST IN HISTORY**

Given the amount of time that the person who created this video has invested to create it, I am very surprised that no mention of [The Gallagher Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallagher_Index) was made since it is a mathematical equation *specifically designed to determine proportionality* in elections.

I've created a whole heap of these, many of which ended up on Wikipedia. You can see them all [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Gallagher_Index).

SO WHY IS IT NOT THE WORST EVER?

According to the spreadsheet and equation (which I have just done and which I have just entered into Wikimedia commons and placed it on the 2015 UK General election page), the recent election gives a disproportionality of **15.04**.

(Note: A Gallagher Index result of 0 implies a perfect democracy. A Gallagher Index result of 100 implies a dictatorship)

So here are the results of the previous elections:

[2005](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2005_UK_General_Election_Gallagher_Index.png): 16.89

[2001](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2001_UK_General_Election_Gallagher_Index.png): 18.03

[1997](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1997_UK_General_Election_Gallagher_Index.png) :16.71

[1992](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1992_UK_General_Election_Gallagher_Index.png): 13.59

[1987](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1987_UK_General_Election_Gallagher_Index.png): 17.82

[1983](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1983_UK_General_Election-Gallagher_Index.svg): 20.62

[1979](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1979_UK_General_Election_Gallagher_Index.png): 11.57

Not counting the recent election, the average since 1979 has been 16.46, so the recent election is slightly **better than average**.

What the Gallagher Index shows is that the 1983 election (the post-Falklands, post-war on miners, re-election of Margaret Thatcher), is the worst in recent history. In that election, the Conservatives won over 61% of the seats with just over 42% of the votes, while the Liberal-SDP alliance won 3.5% of the seats with over 25% of the vote. THAT result was far worse in terms of proportionality than the recent one. And in terms of its effect upon the UK, understand that a significant majority of Britons REJECTED the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher, yet the elctoral system allowed her and her party to stay in power and continue their policies.

---------------------

Having said all that, I support any reasonable steps that the UK can make to ensure more proportional elections. Compared to other Western nations, the UK's system is quite bad. I'm from Australia, and our federal elections in recent years have had Gallagher Index results around 10 or slightly below.

New Zealand's MMP system is very good in terms of the Gallagher Index. Their 2005 election had a result of 1.13.

I live in Tasmania. Our parliament has 5 representatives per electorate (constituency). While I haven't (as yet) published anything onto Wikipedia for Tasmanian election results, ours are usually index results of 5 or lower. It's interesting, but after the 1983 election, the Liberal-SDP alliance (forerunner of today's Liberal Democrats) seriously suggested having multiple members per constituency as a way to address this problem. [They used John Cleese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qWDPauV_p4)


---------------------
And please also note that parliaments with very proportional election results are not always going to be perfect either. [This](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1930_German_federal_election_Gallagher_Index.png) particular election had a Gallagher Index result of 1.33, but was obviously rather problematic.

null,false,spideymurphy,null,null,null,"I think, personally, the best way to critique and/or appreciate Rodgers is to compare him with other premier league managers. I believe it is somewhat futile to compare him to managers in other European leagues without premier league experience.

With regard to the remaining managers in the top 4, there are a few obvious problems and advantages.

Arsene Wenger: A manager who I appreciate extremely, both in terms of prowess and achievement. Wenger has been allowed to make his team his own, promote his work ethic, transfer committee and his own tactical ideas. The advantages are clear, and I believe quite similar to what we may achieve with Rodgers (no, not just banking on top 4, which is still a great achievement), allowing a manager to build the club around his own personal ethos.

Mourinho: Obviously a different beast to Wenger, but most probably more intricately linked to Rodgers. Young during his first rally through the premier league(not Ashley Young whipping in, let's be general, worthless crosses), but incredibly successful. In my opinion Mourinho is one in a kind, as it pains me to say, and quite unattainable by any manager in maybe the next 10 years plus.

Pellegrini: To be honest, I don't really know what to say about Manchester City because they constantly outdo my expectations. I originally thought without the colossal beast of Toure they would be greatly lessened. However, with money power, which I don't know a lot about unfortunately, I can't really comment fully. Money is money in the end

Van Gael: In my opinion still unproved, a manager with little premier league experience. I still believe the premier league is miles above anywhere else/ I've got to the age where researching other leagues is just not fully feasible. Van Gaal has previously inherited teams with a tonne of potential, which the current team, unfortunately for us, has still maintained. However, looking at the Manchester United team in general and in my opinion is lackluster and has completed its final year. Lack of young talent and wasted money on already world class players, which have an immediate impact but not relevant to a greater team altogether(a la Wenger), before people say Arsenal have been generally unsuccessful, top four is essential. Manchester United need a huge overturn in personnel to in any way compete in future years. 

A perfect point to move towards the ethos I see in Rodgers in general, and the most promising ideas I've seen in 15 years (only 22, but still!), Rodgers will allow, along with the club to promote youth talent in the club. Rodgers will demand a specific team ethos to be spread across the first team, an ethos to shape the club for years in the future. I know, we have already spent two years with one manager. Jesus fucking Christ we actually allow a manager to promote fully his own plan. It is this that makes a player, it is this that makes a team, it is this what makes a fully functional machine, it is this that makes a club. A club which we can all be proud of supporting, through thick and thin(this year), in the belief that a young and better manager, yet to complete his full managerial form, can bring us towards a successful and complete future. That is my whiskey fueled two cents, long time lurker, fair time commentator. Rodgers YNWA

null,false,kopking08,null,null,null,"First off, you'll find that it's only Liverpool fans who have any doubts about his tactical acumen or his ability to adjust. Listen to any commentator in the game and they'll laud his ability to change things to suit the moment. You don't just throw out formations if your team plays shit for a little while. Because you can't always know what the issue is. That's not stubbornness. That's just figuring it out. There aren't many coaches in the Prem who'd have tinkered the way he has. You realize the guys favored formation is with one striker on top? Basically a 4-2-3-1. When has he played that with us? Hardly ever. Because he's adjusted. There was no adjustment he could make this past season that would have helped us deal with the fact we had no goalscorers. 

As for firing up the players? Really? We had every chance of being in that United game. Maybe you're just remembering the scoreline. Wouldn't surprise me based on your analysis skills. We almost put away three goals right off the bat. But we didn't have anyone to finish. And then Gerrard comes on and gets a red. Rodgers was supposed to handle that? I mean what could be more deflating than your legend, meant to come on to rally the team, getting a fucking red. Bull shit laying that on Rodgers.

As for CL: well we were shit at the start of the season. We didn't have Suarez or Studge. Expecting any manager to figure that out is expecting a lot. I agree we should have done more against the sides in our group, but Rodgers and most of the squad had never played in CL. It was a lot of inexperience all around. 

Forgotten in the critiques of our cup runs is that we were in two semi-finals. In case you've forgotten, a lot of teams with managers you probably think are better didn't get that far. Should we have lost to Villa? No. But the other big clubs should have gotten farther too. Shit happens.

As for media...I've seen a lot of this criticism and it seems like most of you don't understand how the media works. Rodgers gets asked questions. He answers them. The media pick the headlines. It's often cited about his Tottenham jibe. That's just plain unfortunate. I'm sure he regrets it now, but go through Mourinho, Wenger, Ferguson, Van Gaal's, and on and on down the line, pressers and you'll find enough to think they're all fucking idiots. 

Let's think about how he answered questions in his first year. The criticism he always received was that he was too positive. In his second year, when we were title contenders, the criticism was that he wasn't aiming high enough. Maybe at some point someone would realize that the guy is managing expectations and attempting to motivate his players. 

Based on everything they've said about him, it's clearly working for anyone who hasn't left due to not being needed. 


My only consistent criticism of Rodgers is that he doesn't seem to know how to substitute in an effective way. That just might be that we don't have enough players with graft coming off the bench, but I often feel his substitutions are too late or don't deal with the immediate problem. 

After that, I'd say his transfer dealings haven't been ideal. But even there it's hard to say what's his fault versus the committee or just the money the club has.

null,false,Lozzy1256,null,null,null,"I would thoroughly recommend buying travel insurance. What if something happens to someone back home and you need to come home to see someone in hospital or a funeral? Can you afford to do that out of your own pocket? What if your bag doesn't turn up in Africa? Can you afford to replace everything in it? What if you become sick? Can you afford medical costs? What about if you are very unwell and need returned to the UK on a special medical flight? They can run you tens of thousands of pounds.If you buy online for a single trip policy you'll have an accepted date (the date you buy it) and a start date (the date you go away). But, you wont be covered for anything you already know about, this makes it an anticipated event.If you're going away for a month, you might want to look at an annual policy. This would cover you for multiple trips for a year. This can include mini breaks in the UK. If you do this though, make sure to check the trip limits, some of them are 30 days, some up to 45, and you can always pay for an extension. Make sure to check out the policy document (they're all online) for these to make sure your trip doesn't overrun the limits.Also, check that your bank account doesn't offer free insurance with it, it could be cheaper to pay for an upgrade on that for the trip limit or geographical limits than to buy a whole new policy. Also, depending where in Africa you're going, you might be included in a European policy (most insurers count the countries surrounding the med as European so that includes Egypt and Tunisia).Things to look out for:- valuable limits on the policy. Many policies will have a limit on valuables. This can include, but is not limited to, any electronic items, glasses, and jewellery. These are thongs that must be kept in your hand luggage, on your person (not locked in a car) or in your own personal locked accommodation, and in a safe where one is available in your hotel room (size depending). The policies I work with have a limit for this of between £250 and £500, and this is for ALL your valuables, so if for example, you're mugged, and they take your laptop and phone, that could be as little as £250 all in for that.- personal money/cash limits for the policy. This is the amount we would consider if you had cash/money stolen or lost. There are often two limits for this, a money limit, and then a specific cash limit. I'm not sure how you're planning to manage your cash situation out there, but you'll be better off insurance wise not having more cash than the limit, then having up to the money limit in prepaid bank cards, and then withdrawing anything else you need out there, as and when.- medical conditions on the policy. Insurers wont cover you for anything you've had before, so make sure to declare any medical conditions you have so they can be factored in and then covered. You also won't be covered of you haven't had all the recommended jabs and vaccinations, so make sure that's all done.- baggage/personal possession limits on the policy. Check to see how much you would be covered for if you're taking a ton of stuff. Also, if you claim for something like this, you will need receipts and/or photographs of the items, so keep a list!",null,0,null,1434520105,null,0,false,0,cs9acol,null,t3_3a4aa6,null,t1_cs9acol,null,t3_3a4aa6,null,null,null,1437130876,null,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4,null

Just two quick examples of their elite jerkdom from this past season:

null,false,Lozzy1256,null,null,null,"(continued, on phone so it won't let me comment on my own post)Other notable points:- carry the number for your insurance with you, both the standard one and the emergency one. If there is some sort of emergency, these people are dead experienced at sorting shit out in other countries - use their experience. Also, try to call as soon as possible if it's not an emergency since insurers expect you to notify them as soon as possible.- carry a copy of your schedule of insurance with you. For two reasons. First, if you need medical treatment, some places will refuse to treat you without seeing this. Secondly, should something terrible happen, the hospital can call our emergency number and we can coordinate with your doctor back home to get important medical records to them.- get everything in writing. Airline loses your bag? Get a loss report or PIR (property irregularity report). Flight is cancelled.or late? Get a letter stating how long for or when the next available flight is. Lose something? Get a police report. Seriously, get everything in writing. - keep receipts. Keep your booking invoice for your flights and accommodation, keep your exchange receipt, everything. Keep receipts for any medical bills, and keep anything the hospital give you, including reports, letters and invoices.- don't get too drunk. Most insurers won't cover you if we think you were too drunk. If you're at a hospital and do a blood test, we will check your BAC.- know your policy. The people taking claims won't generally keep offering you everything you CAN maybe claim for, they might just process a claim for what you say you want to claim for, but there might be a benefit or another section of the policy you can claim for as well.- don't commit fraud. If you have multiple insurance policies for the same thing (I.e. Specific laptop insurance, and travel insurance, don't be silly and claim on both because insurance companies talk to each other). - know your excess. This is the amount of money we deduct from your settlement before we pay it. It varies from policy to policy and even within each section of the policy, so be aware of what that is.I've splurged as much as I can think of down just now, but if you've got any questions just ask.DISCLAIMER: I am not an insurance broker, and am providing general advice from my own personal views so you need to do your own research since every policy is different and your needs are different from everyone elses. These are general points for you to look at, with examples, but you should check everything.",null,0,null,1434521064,null,0,false,0,cs9apqe,null,t3_3a4aa6,null,t1_cs9apqe,null,t3_3a4aa6,null,null,null,1437131160,null,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5,null

News flash. We already are. 

&gt; More pointing out that the people in charge are smart people with a long record of success in many different fields, 

What football club have they succeeded at. Football isnt yankee cricket, I told you the same yest. to which you had zero counter argument apart from incessant rambling that they are somehow connected and success in one means success will follow in another. That successful hedge fund managers will be successful in football. Solid logic. Zero experience and they are still earning and not good at it. You dont like that? Too bad. 

&gt;while you have demonstrated the square root of fuck all.

And you have demonstrated what exactly? An opinion just like mine. 

&gt; While fans have a right to discuss and blame the board for their failures, without having ever been in that role your credibility in how you criticize them and why they make the decisions they makes you look like a twat.

So wait wait wait. As per your braindead logic, only people who've run a football club can criticize other football club owners? Heh. Swell. 

&gt; You operate a pound shop, they operate multi-billion businesses.

You're obsessed with me it seems. Write me a book! I'd be happy to sign you up for one! And what exactly does that have to do with having an opinion? 

&gt;But again you come back with the smarmy negative comments about the club. 

Just balancing out idiots who think it's all great, you see. A dose of reality.

&gt; I gave up reading your comments and just kept scrolling.

Lol. Ok. You stopped reading and dug up personal stuff. I believe you. 

&gt;hatred and bile about a club in a city you've no affiliation with, and more than likely never will

Hatred? Alright, whatever. If calling a spade a spade is hatred, then I'm a hater. A buffoon at the helm, clueless committees, a bunch of kids doesnt sound like a winning formula, but then again, you seem to have plenty of turds to polish. 

&gt;You continually put people down on here,

null,false,bainesworld,lfc87,,null,"It all depends what you mean by proven.  The most proven player we've bought under Rodgers was Balotelli, a player who has proved he can bang in goals for top clubs and at international level.  

Proven talent from abroad doesn't always work out though as some just can't adapt to the premier league.  Falcao and Di Maria are about as proven as you can get and neither of them shone last season, especially Falcao.  Soldado was proven talent in Spain, so was Aspas (we did sign him)  Podolski was proven talent, especially internationally.  Successful abroad does not mean successful in the premier league, which is why it is much safer to buy within the premier league, despite the price difference.  Arsenal bought Ozil for 40mil, Man U bought Mata for a similar fee.  I'd say that Mata has been the better signing so far and I'd say that is due to his Chelsea experience.

If you look at the most successful off shore signings from last season (Costa and Sanchez) we actually tried to sign both of them.  When we went after Costa he didn't want to leave Athletico Madrid and then couldn't compete with Chelsea the year after.  We met Sanchez' release clause, but he chose London over Liverpool.  Real life isn't like FIFA or Football Manager (a comparison that gets thrown around a lot on here), you can't just throw unlimited money at players to make them sign, they have to want to come too. If we had a realistic chance of signing someone like Benzema or Lewandowski let's say, don't you think we'd take it.

Lots of the most successful foreign imports were bought young (hazard, Henry, Van Persie) or bought from foreign academies (Fabregas).  This is exactly what we are trying to do now and some of them take time.  

Marquee signings are good.  They get the fans excited and can really quality that can make a difference, such as when Van Persie went to Salford United (incidentally, bought from the premiership).  They aren't always available though and when they work, it doesn't matter where you buy them from.

**Because of David Moyes...**

Manchester United finished 4th this season and I'm still positive about Louis van Gaal. 

This is because United finished 7th under David Moyes in the previous season. 

If van Gaal had become United manager after Alex Ferguson then finishing 4th would have been less acceptable because Fergie won everything in his 26 years in charge... and his last season saw United crowned champions.

Maths obviously not being your strong point. Neither is your change in tone from previous comments that we'd soon end up there.

&gt; What football club have they succeeded at. Football isnt yankee cricket, I told you the same yest. to which you had zero counter argument apart from incessant rambling that they are somehow connected and success in one means success will follow in another. That successful hedge fund managers will be successful in football. Solid logic. Zero experience and they are still earning and not good at it. You dont like that? Too bad.

No, the point was that that board members of the clubs you seem to want to support (but only it would take you away from trolling on here) didn't have previous success at any other club before they ended up at the club they're at now. They were successful in one industry, then moved into football and became a success at that. The reason why would be they transferred the same principles they used in normal industry to the football world. Who exactly you want to run the club is unclear, but I'm guessing skills in selling phone accessories would be high on the list on what they'd need to have demonstrated. Oh and a desire to only concentrate on the here and now, and not on anything that concerns the future. Thats the type of thinking that makes smart business people. Maybe they'll start using it in MBA courses of the future. ""How to get ahead, the accessory way""....

&gt; And you have demonstrated what exactly? An opinion just like mine.

I don't need to demonstrate anything. I'm not the bitch sitting on the sidelines complaining about those who've shown the capability to get from nowhere to own and run a billion dollar football club. 

&gt; So wait wait wait. As per your braindead logic, only people who've run a football club can criticize other football club owners? Heh. Swell.

No dumbass. Re-read what I said. Fans have a right to discuss and criticize the board, just the same as any customer of any business does. You've taken that to a much greater degree of personal abuse of the people involved, yet you know absolutely fucking nothing of the decisions they face everyday and why they make the decisions they do, and the financial implications of these decisions. Why can't they spend 30m on superstar X?. And another 40m on superstar Y?. Perhaps its because Liverpool is a working class city where that type of shitehawking isn't appreciated. Perhaps its because it would mean having to layoff other staff around the club in a city with high unemployment. Perhaps you'd know that if you had any knowledge of the city. Perhaps you'd be better off fucking off and supporting City and Chelsea instead of singing YNWA at the start of matches, and then spending your week complaining like a bitch about players/coaches/management without any fucking clue of why there might be a conflict there.  

&gt;You're obsessed with me it seems. Write me a book! I'd be happy to sign you up for one! And what exactly does that have to do with having an opinion?

Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one. That you decide to demonstrate them in the way that you do says everything about you as an individual. That you decide to be a depressive complaining cunt on here allows me to have an opinion that you're a goatfucking cunt with no life to live.

&gt; Just balancing out idiots who think it's all great, you see. A dose of reality.

Sure... the world needs to know the manic depressive thoughts of phone accessory salespeople. 

&gt; Hatred? Alright, whatever. If calling a spade a spade is hatred, then I'm a hater. A buffoon at the helm, clueless committees, a bunch of kids doesnt sound like a winning formula, but then again, you seem to have plenty of turds to polish.

And you'll never have to put any of your thoughts or opinions on how to improve it to the test. Unlike those in place who have had to prove themselves to get where they are. 

&gt; Thanks for the love random internet stranger. Sure, no personal attacks. No siree. Your obsession knows no bounds. But I'm honored.

Again if you read what I said I didn't say there were no personal attacks, just the bit you claimed to be a personal attack wasn't an actual personal attack.

&gt;Worked in a schools IT Dept as a sysadmin till march.
This article is just shit stirring. Schools have had this software in place for fucking years, if not Impero then something like Securus. And you know what? Its completely fucking necessary.

When you drop your little darlings off at school you give over a duty of care to said children, meaning the school has a responsibility to ensure the child is in a protected environment. Guess what? The internet isn't a lovely land of rainbows and sunshine, you categorically need software like Impero because its the best at what it does. Its basically a glorified word list that integrates with AD, you set the policy that you want, i.e. the word ""porn"" and in the event of that word appearing on someones screen it will send a little prompt to the admin, it will also normally take a screenshot or start recording their screen. It can close the window on their computer, it can blank their screen or disable their mouse/keyboard inputs. Its fantastic at what it does.

It comes prepackaged with words like ""cutting"" or ""self harm"" because its specifically designed for a school environment where young teenagers may be experiencing abuse or bullying so i ask is it still wrong to track these kind of things? It will also flag up extremist content by default (which is no different from what the guardian is saying its only implementing now) whether it be about ISIS or the KKK.

Now as 1984 as this sounds, because of said duty of care us horrible Nazi Mods are 100% forced to use this software because if little Timmy stumbles on videos of people getting their heads cut off and doesn't like it and tells his parents you can bet your bottom dollar they will be down at the school in a flash complaining.
As totally lovely (and time saving) it would be to not have to implement these policies on the entire network, if you're under 18 then no you probably shouldn't be looking at GTA V, school is also not a good place for gambling, watching porn, torrenting or using TOR.

'Tactics' are overblown when you don't have the personnel or when you're forced to bed in half a squad worth of players under 23.

The fact is, even Klopp would have a mare trying to get this team into the top 4, let alone without being able to play his best striker. We have average players at GK, in defence, up front, and in midfield. This is a recipe for 5th/6th in perpetuity until our younger players mature (under current FSG policy).

Utter tosh.  I'll repost this from a [comment I made yesterday about how the JC advisors treat people](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3a0imo/when_the_jobcentre_wont_help_jobseekers_find_paid/cs882jv):

&gt;&gt;I don't believe a single word of this article.

&gt;My son-in-law went through a similar situation to that in the article:

&gt;He was doing a part-time college course (less than 16 hours a week, BTEC level 3). One of the college advisor's told him to sign on for JSA as his girlfriend/my daughter had just fallen pregnant and money was tight. He took all his college paperwork with him when he signed on and was told he was fully eligible for JSA providing he was looking for work whilst not at college.
His original JSA advisor was perfectly happy with his course and the amount of job searches he was doing. A few months later his advisor changed and she went out of her way to make his life difficult. She's 'forget' to click whatever button needed to be clicked to say he'd attended his sign-on. His JSA was stopped with no warning as all of a sudden his course was at too high a level (it wasn't). CAB got involved and had that decision overturned. A couple of months later he was told he'd have to do a work placement - which just happened to be on the exact same days that he was at college. His tutors at college arranged for him to be continue via personal meetings and distance learning. He was sanctioned for a month for failing to attend the JC despite calling them 24 hours before to re-arrange as my daughter had just gone into a labour. That was overturned again with the help of the CAB. Her favourite tactic was to randomly change the time and dates of his sign-ons. He'd get a call at 9am telling him his appointment was at 9:15am that day or he'd turn up for a sign-on to be told that it had been moved back four hours. It only stopped when the CAB contacted her manager's manager and he was shifted to a different advisor.
It was all totally petty bullshit from a single advisor who seemed to have a bee in her bonnet about someone actually wanting to better themselves by going to college rather than settling for working at one of the local fish processors.

Then there's the people who are sanctioned for not attending a work placement because doing so would mean having to quit an existing part time job.  

The sanctions do not punish those that have no intention of looking for work, they punish those that try to work with the system.  The real work-shy ones know every trick in the book to actually avoid getting a job whilst staying just far enough inside the rules to avoid a sanction.",null,0,null,1434526180,null,0,false,0,cs9cb2f,null,t3_3a2tsr,null,t1_cs9cb2f,null,t1_cs9c08g,null,null,null,1437132310,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

If you look at your history you'll see that Saudi basically threw in the towel at maintaining a high oil price back in 1986, after their attempt to keep the price up by reducing production nearly led to them exiting the oil production business.  OPEC certainly weren't having the time of their lives when oil was $10/bbl during the 90s, but all their spare capacity kept prices low until it was exhausted around 2005.  This is *exactly* what happened in the 50's and 60's, when the Texas railroad comission basically suppressed global prices by pro-rating output from wells, until their spare capacity ran out around 70 or so and we had another price spike.  However one never hears any conspiracy theories about the eeeevil Texas RRC, for some reason.  Before the RRC it was the standard oil monopoly.  Without some big monopolistic body basically keeping a lid on things you get massive instability with periods of overproduction and shortage, which is what we're seeing at the moment.

North sea is fucked anyway.  I know of a good few operators who were barely making any money last year when we still had $100/bbl.  Infrastructure is too old, targets are way poor quality and so on.

null,false,Prannet,eng-GreaterLondon,London,null,"&gt;How would you suggest giving valuable experience to these people who possess CVs that are lacking?

Not the person you were asking but this really isn't that difficult : 


One way would be to stress the importance of volunteering. Someone unemployed for 2+ years would benefit far more from a 6 month one day a week voluntary role of their choice far more than they would from being thrown into a company looking for free labour. It'd increase their confidence and add a bucket load to their CV. 
There are charities out there that rely on almost nothing but volunteers, so the opportunities are out there but JCP tend to have problems with this if it's for more than a day a week, as if missing out on two days banging your head against the wall is going to make a difference when you've done it for 2 years with no outcome.

There's also things like [this](http://www.princes-trust.org.uk/need_help/courses/get_into.aspx?gclid=CMGHisCflsYCFUH4wgod8kYAgw), short, vocational and more importantly voluntary courses in sectors, which one political party were looking into extending and funding to go beyond young people prior to the election. Still unpaid, yes, but people take part because of the benefits it brings, not because they were told to go there. Again, it gives experience and you genuinely do get to actually make an impression on staff who can hire and it increases confidence. People completing these courses can and regularly do go onto employment with the company. I wonder if workfare could say the same thing.

Not too bad IMO. Chelsea as the second game will be an interesting one. Could easily be a 0-0 because Jose does like to start off cagily and everyone is just back from holiday. On the other hand his squad is much more settled than ours and it means we're rushing Fernandinho, Aguero and Zabaleta back quickly.

I quite like having the firs derby away from home. Feels like a massive boost if we win, but if we lose, there's still a chance to redeem ourselves later, at home.

Key Text

&gt;The Labour Party have got a particular nerve on this subject as the Labour Government banned Job Centre staff from being able to issue Foodbank vouchers. This ban was ended by Iain Duncan Smith. We have yet to hear an apology from Mr Duncan Smith's Labour predecessor as Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper. Nor from her predecessor James Purnell or Peter Hain.

&gt;I spoke about this to Chris Mould, Executive Chairman of the Trussell Trust the organisation behind the foodbanks network.

&gt;In the early days of foodbanks we had local arrangements with Job Centres.

&gt;The ban on Department of Work and Pensions staff from issuing vouchers came in just before Christmas in 2008. It meant extra hassle and extra obstacle for those getting help. They could still get hold of vouchers from other places like Citizens Advice Bureaus but it was harder for them.

&gt;The reason for the ban given was equity. The DWP said that as there wasn't a foodbank everywhere they wouldn't refer anyone to a foodbank as we didn't have one in every town. On the same basis they stopped giving details of Salvation Army hostels. They also said it wasn't  there job to help people as they were an eligibility service not a social service. But they were the ones responsible who made the decisions. They knew if someone's benefit was being delayed.

&gt;It was a disagreement we had with the Labour Government. We thought it was just plain good sense to issue a voucher if it was needed.

&gt;We had a campaign against the ban. It was very, very helpful to us that Iain Duncan Smith lifted the ban even though it was against the wishes of officials in the DWP.

&gt;However efficient the DWP might say they are it is giving out benefits remember they have 22 million people. Just a fraction of one per ceent not getting paid means thousands of people who need to be fed.

They ring the doorbell but immediately stick the card through the letterbox and walk back to their van, meaning 10 seconds later when I've got to the door I end up chasing them down the drive to pick up my parcel  
  
They don't turn up at all, making me wait in all day during their 11 hour window only to be told ""sorry, the driver didn't have time to get to you today"" at about 7:30pm

#Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions. 
**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. 

Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured; however there is some regular measure of “underemployment” by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted.

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and say they want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. Note that the Inactive category is only for 16-64 year olds. 

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public.

You mean, the whole concept of people believing in a smaller state, fiscal conservatism, and classical liberalism is something you had never heard of?

This is why people on here don’t represent the country. You simply can’t comprehend the positive arguments for something you disagree with. YES, people voted for a conservative government because this is exactly what they wanted. NO, that doesn’t mean people voted for it to screw everyone else over and line the pockets of the rich.

It’s honestly ridiculous that people on here were surprised so much by the election results. Not because it went against the popular polling, but because people on here think that no one could possibly vote for something you disagree with on the grounds that it will have a positive impact to this country.

People have different political and economic ideologies. Is this news to you people? Or did you all just assume that everyone was a socialist except a bunch of people who were so rich they didn’t want to be taxed? And do you honestly think that anyone who believes in a smaller state is categorically wrong?

The left treating their agenda as “factually” correct, and acting like anyone who disagrees with them is simply “wrong” or “evil” is one of the many, many reasons they lost.

null,false,Ghiestuk,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,null,"I've had the misfortune to be on the 'dole' twice in my life.  Once in the late 90's and again in 2010 years ago.  The difference was just massive.  I don't want to sound like an old fogey where they never do it like they used to but I think it's relevant here.  In 98 the company I was working for went bankrupt and I started to sign on as I was young, stupid and never had built up enough to live on whilst looking for a job.  So like any sane person I signed on.  
  
I was only signing on for around 12 weeks, because in most part they actually found me a job.  Within those 12 weeks I saw the same person each week and we sat down for 15 minutes and went through every single job that was available to me and even on multiple occasions helped me fill out forms and made phone calls on my behalf (no mobile and no home phone at the time).  I was required to look for jobs and prove i had done so by filling out forms - and these were checked.  3 Months later I have a job.  
  
10+ years later, I am laid off the place where I worked due to staff restructuring and cutbacks I am pretty much in the same position and have to sign on to live.  I go back to the same job centre, there are 1/3 of the people working there my sign ons are now around 1-2 minutes and I have ot hand over forms that just have random stuff on that could be made up (and as far as I can tell looking at some of the people there it probably is).  I am required by the job centre to do at least 5 hours looking for a job a day just to receive the benefits.  The touch screen computers that have all the jobs listed don't work properly and the search function on them is completely broken so they are useless.  So the job centre is no use, don't care as long as you make shit up on your forms to look like you're doing stuff.  
  
6 months later they don't like i'm still signing on so put me on a back to work interview with some farmed out company (the now legendary A4E).   I have an arranged interview at the job centre with the a4e rep, but she never shows - rinse and repeat for the next FOUR appointments that are not on the normal signing day (did I mention that I had to travel 12 miles to the job centre @ 4-5 quid a pop on the bus?).  In the mean time I get a job from my endless rounds of phone calls to companies.  To top it off I have endless letters and phonecalls from A4E asking for the details of my employer and where I was employed so they can fill out the details 'to provide support'.  I've been employed for 5 years and my last letter from A4E was 3 weeks ago asking the same  questions just so they can chase the sign up fee from the government.  
  
So my experience is pretty much the same as most people these days  and I suspect it's even worse now - they need to hit targets, check the boxes rather than actually trying to help people get work they are trying to force people off benefits by bullying them.

The difficulty in swapping ISP's is part of the reason for writing this thread, as each time we call them up requesting information, fixes or to request the mac code, we get fobbed off with false promises each and every time to get us to keep with them, no matter how insistent we are in saying 'no we want to leave' - they simply will not give us the mac code needed so we can join with another ISP.

I believe our neighbour is using BT as their ISP, and it was with BT that we were hoping to also return to, despite the difficulties we have had with them in the past.

BT would have been ideal choice to come and fix the socket yes, but the last time we had to rely on them to come and fix something, we had to wait 3 months before anything was done and 2 years after that before a proper permanent fix was made. Due to where we live,  we desperately rely on the landline as we also have very poor mobile phone reception, and looking at another potential 3 months to wait for them to come around to fix a simple socket when we could have done the job ourselves in a few minutes wasn't much of a choice in that unfortunately. 

How would you advise on switching ISP's? I believe we are locked into a contract with them - we had an open window not too long ago to leave them, we took advantage of them, but they fobbed us off again with promises of a 'magic router' which we're stilli waiting for (going on 4 or 5 months now) - pretty convinced they only said things like that to keep us on board until the window passed and we were locked in with them again.",null,0,null,1434531813,null,0,false,0,cs9dp0h,null,t3_39tvmp,null,t1_cs9dp0h,null,t1_cs9c4ys,null,null,null,1437133227,null,1,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,1,null

It's more about not _simply_ offering charity, but always linking it to political action for systemic change and making those you help instrumental in their own empowerment.  Giving them control over the process and the output rather than merely paternalistically handing them scraps to eat and keeping them dependent on your handouts.

null,false,DogShackStudio,null,null,null,"A) There is still a split but it is very minor. The only time things get heated is during July 12th when Loyalists march past Nationalist areas. During this time there is usually 2/3 days of rioting. When I say rioting I mean there are usually groups of teenagers, and possible a few older knuckledraggers, who throw stones at the police. This 'rioting' only takes place in a few very isolated areas where both communities intersect. If you happen to be in NI at the time there is a 99.9% you will not even know any trouble is taking place. 

Recently the only other source of trouble has been concerning a flag being flown over the city hall. In the UK all the towns fly the flag on special occasions but here in Belfast it was flown all year round. There was a vote and people decided to take it down and mimic the rest of the UK but this didn't sit well with a few extreme loyalists. For the first few days there was a lot of rioting but since that time there has just been a weekly protest which is laughable to say the least.

There is still 'peace' walls in place to keep communities separated but these act more like tourists attractions in this day and age. A majority of the people here don't care less about whether you are a nationalist or unionist. The only people who hold grudges are older folks who maybe lost loved ones during the troubles and can't get past it or young people who typically grew up in low-income council estates (Government housing I think it's called in the US), inherited their bigotry from their parents, and never received/didn't care about educating themselves enough to realize how silly their mindset is.

B) No, the IRA is no longer active, they swapped their guns for suits and are now trying to achieve their goals through political means. Sinn Fein is the party which the IRA essentially morphed into. However many members of the IRA refuse to give up their armed struggle until Ireland is united into one country. These people split off and formed their own splinter groups (CIRA, RIRA, ONH) and, at least in theory, continue fighting the British government. 

Many of these splinter groups got into the drug game and now only care about making money but a few still cause hassle every now and again. A year or two ago there was a few week period during Christmas when there was a few bomb scares. Nothing ever came of it minus a bit of disruption. Overall the problem is basically non-existence. These people don't have much support and are considered a bit of a joke to be honest. Most people on here poke fun at them and their tactics by saying things like  ""1. Plant bombs 2. ???????? 3.

Right now it can only be dissolved two ways:

1. By an act of parliament.

2. By an incoming monarch.

Point 2 is pretty much irrelevant as a monarch is not monarch until parliament says so. By convention the bill that recognises the new king says ""X is king and has kindly agreed to keep the crown estates where they are"". If they choose not to sign it they are not king.

So the technically correct answer is if it were dissolved while we remained a monarchy it would become property of the royal family. If it were dissolved when we were a republic it would become property of the state.

It sounds like you're accepting their no as an answer - don't. Ring up their cancellation lines, say you're cancelling your service and giving whatever notice you're required to do and get the code. If they don't provide it within the 5 working days then report them to OFCOM. The only valid reason to decline the code would be if you have an ""LLU"" service, in which case they have 10 days to release the line.

If you're somehow tied into a contract again, then you'll either have to pay to leave, or prove that they've failed to provide whatever service that was promised.

In terms of switching ISP to BT:  
BT have no more right to get your line fixed than another other ISP or telephone provider, they have to go through the same process as any other. As a retail arm (i.e. who you'd be doing business with), they have nothing to do with BTWholesale or BTOpenreach (who provide services to retail companies who you do business with). They just happen to share a name after the monopoly was split up. However, aside from this master socket business (you really shouldn't have messed with that yourself - if they come out and there's a problem with it you could be left with a bill well over £100), your line is probably completely fine, so switching ISPs will probably give you what you want.

If I were you, I'd get hold of TalkTalk and ask them what your current contract period is, when it started and why it started (e.g. they gave you a better price in exchange for a 2 year contract or something). Finally ask them if you're free to leave or if you'd have to pay. I don't think promising you a new router would be enough to lock you in, but maybe you agreed to something else at the same time. If they never provided the router then you can probably get out of it.

Yeah I kind of had no choice because to consider your original quote in pure form:
&gt;Ahhh, it's funny because you're confusing UKIP with literally every political party. 

If the word ""other"" isn't in there somewhere then it implies either that UKIP isn't a political party or that I'm somehow confusing UKIP with itself on presumably some kind of quantum basis.

Not to mention, let's assume you're correct...how precisely does that challenge my point? UKIP *are* the ones trying to shut down a decent chunk of UK immigration via exit from the EU, and we *have* had nearly two decades of Prime Ministers and Parliaments in which the cacophony about immigration has been growing and growing and growing and yet none of them have had the will or the power to do anything about it. These aren't suppositions, they're facts. My original point, as you have been keen to ignore, is that it's poetically just that a party that wants to exclude what we can assume to be a decent chunk of people from entering this country is throwing a hissy fit because they've been told they can't take part in an event organised and presided over by someone they can't influence. 

&gt;You're also conflating lax immigration laws and ministerial incompetence with total open borders.

An open border by definition allows anyone to enter or leave. And anyone *can* enter or leave, provided they're from an EU country. By definition, therefore, we have open borders within the EU.

Wouldn't surprise me based on your analysis skills. We almost put away three goals right off the bat. But we didn't have anyone to finish. And then Gerrard comes on and gets a red. Rodgers was supposed to handle that? I mean what could be more deflating than your legend, meant to come on to rally the team, getting a fucking red. Bull shit laying that on Rodgers.

I had a good laugh at the majority of your comment and the tone of it. But if you want to tell me we could have beat United home or away deservedly with a straight face you are a massive idiot and 'judging by your analysis skills' that isn't far off. Gerrard came on and kicked off because he obviously wanted to fire up the team who had been utterly abysmal and like I aid rolling over to fucking United. He was an idiot for stamping on Herrera, but we needed someone sticking meaty challenges in and lighting the fuse. The rest of the team just let the result happen. Did you watch that game, or are you just making it up as you go?

There isn't any revisionism in my comment, we got to the semi's of the FA cup after shit performances against Championship teams. We played 2 premier league teams in that run and lost to one, but please validate that by saying ""oh but other managers lost too"". Other managers didn't produce shit football all season, embarrassing results in Europe and blundering league performances. 

That media justification too. You don't address what I'm actually talking about Sterling's contract and setting that saga off, his comments like ""spending 100 million you should be challenging for the title"", ""Southampton don't have to sell"".   Talking about United ""They'll struggle without Champions league football to attract good players"".

No I think that sanctions can be and are being applied unfairly in order to meet targets.

Let's compare having a job to being on JSA:

If your bus was late and you turned up for work five minutes late would your boss dock you a months pay?  

If you missed a meeting because your boss forgot to send you an invite until after the meeting would you lose up to six months of pay?

Would your boss expect you to work double shifts for no extra pay or to work for a 40 hour week for one day's pay?  

Once again.  The people who know how to game the system are the ones that aren't being sanctioned.  Part of my wife's family have been doing if for *decades*.  They know exactly what to say to the advisors, how to constantly switch between JSA and ESA or pop out another baby, how to fill an application form in so it ends up at the bottom of a pile, how to fluff an interview, if there's a dodge they know it.  And they've never been so much as threatened with a sanction. *Because they know how to play the game.*

Do you think we've seen an increase in numbers people relying on food banks from 61,000 to 913,000 since 2010 is because all those people are scroungers?

An authentic email we just received:

""Good morning,
I am an employer based in […] and have advertised 3 jobs on Universal Jobmatch this week.  After 5 days we had 804 applications for 1 of our jobs.
My problem lies with the fact that this job is for 7.5 hours per week and is a cleaning role.  It took our admin assistant nearly 2 days to review the applications and make all relevant contact with suitable applicants.  Out of the 804 applications we received, only 10 were suitable for the job.  These applicants had no knowledge of the job and were adamant they did not apply.  Furthermore, a number of applicants were in full time employment and were not at all interested in looking for another job, let alone a 7.5 hour per week cleaning role!
I have since learned about your “Universal Automation” and how it applies for jobs for jobseekers automatically without any action required by the jobseeker.  I would like to know what benefit your extension was meant to have on employers and how your creation can be used only for productive purposes and not as a time wasting, benefits box-ticking tool.
Yours,""

Now, my question is, why are you angry at the writers of a small app, and instead not angry at a government policy that ensures unemployed people will apply for any job, no matter how irrelevent to them?

Their attitude is that if something just about works, that's good enough and there's no point spending money improving it.

I know of at least one major bank which still runs entirely on Windows XP, and has no plans to upgrade because everything just about *works*.

A lot of the core technology banks use was written in the 80's or earlier, in COBOL. Hardly anybody knows COBOL anymore, so when things do go wrong they have to go and find somebody to fix it (probably at the nearest nursing home). Then that one bug gets fixed, everything spins up again and they never bother to fix the underlying problem, because that would cost a lot of money.

Then this sort of thing happens.

Yes. Our two main political parties are a Nationalist party (Sinn Fein) and a Unionist party (DUP).

&gt; What I mean by that is do folks pay attention to that still?

Yeah. A lot of people are still really invested in unionism or nationalism. Maybe not as many as there used to be.

&gt; Is it still heated?

It can be quite heated but it's mainly just politicians arguing about parks names and what to do with the historical scandals that have taken place. Petty insults are still exchanged followed by much eye rolling.

&gt; Can you explain what the situation is like today?

Economic issues center stage, creating tension between the parties. The Nationalists are vehemently anti-austerity. The Unionists say we've got as much money from Westminister as we're going to get and we need to get on with things. The cutting of funding is hitting our national services bad.

Historical justice continues to be a problematic issue. Some people want to chase the ghosts of our past so they can get resolution for crimes committed. Others feel like we should drop the subject altogether as it costs money we don't have.

We had found the one we wanted &amp; the local PC World was near enough the cheapest. I also happened to need a 2.5 to 3.5"" drive mounting bracket for a new SSD. Sure its not a usual consumer product but I was going there anyway &amp; noticed they sold a few SSD's &amp; other pc components so thought id give it a try.

I spoke to every single member of staff in there (there were over a dozen as it was a very busy period) &amp; my experience put them into 2 distinct categories. Archetypal sales people who hung around the tv section chatting amongst themselves &amp; doing nothing until they spotted a potential victim perusing the tv's. They didnt have a single iota of interest in anyone who wasn't a potential high ticket sale, at best I was directed in the vague direction of another section of the store, it was clear that I wasn't their problem. The others were young staff, presumably working weekend jobs, who were perfectly competent at basic general retail skills but dreadfully lacking in their product knowledge, they did try to help as best they could but to no avail. I soon gave up my search as I was unsure if anyone i had spoken to knew what an SSD was, the aforementioned sales people has also pissed me off by making me feel like a nuisance &amp; not a customer.

I found my mrs who had located the printer &amp; we queued for the tills. An elderly lady infront of me was buying a number of cheap Android tablets (presumably christmas presents) and the sales person at the till was trying to upsell Norton Mobile Security or something similar. She was clearly reluctant to pay any more &amp; wanted know just how important it was. The sales person was (albeit gently) trying to persuade her to buy a copy for each of the tablets (the lady had already declined to buy cases for the devices), I stepped in &amp; helped her make her mind up by telling her she could download an equivalent software from the app store on the device, said to search for Avast which she wrote down.

I admit it was a dick move, that staff member had done nothing to me &amp; they probably lost commission or at least lost a point toward their targets, but my whole experience in their store was atrocious.

As for other Canadians, while I can't speak for all I can tell you what I've heard from friends and family.  Everyone I know actually travels a LOT. Saying we rarely leave is just wrong. But there's a few factors that decide where they go:

- Canada itself is HUGE. It's a shorter flight to Hong Kong or Tokyo than London from our west coast. So many from there head east. I know 1 person in HK right now, and another in Taiwan.
- We live next to a big neighbor too. New York, Vegas, LA, New Orleans etc, all 3+ hours away. 
- Being from a cold country, we also like to venture somewhere warm when we can. And Mexico and the Caribbean and Hawaii are perfect (for a visit at least, no one wants to work there).
- When people do go to Europe, the UK is too similar to home. We go to other countries for something a bit different. Germany is popular for the people I know.
- being from the Canadian prairies, we have stronger cultural ties to Ukrainians and Eastern Europeans, so family-related visas from those countries may be easier to get.
- and finally, though it sounds rude it isn't intended to be, but what has the UK done for us lately? There's no special relationship between our countries, and for the most part you folks ignore us. There's really nothing to draw us there. As an example, my friend is planning her months-long holiday right now. Prague, Austria, Hungary, Romania...the UK isn't even on her radar.

Understand that for us, Europe is a BIG trip. We're going to go somewhere exotic (at least compared to us) and make it a trip of a lifetime if we can!

Edit: wanted to add this - The UK is expensive to live/work, we get zero considerations for being a Commonwealth country (which really is meaningless), we have no options to stay longer, we have similar cultures and we have no real bonds through trade, sport or anything else. I think the question is why *would* most Canadians want to work in the UK? As much as we like to bicker with the U.S., they're our brothers.

The Tories meanwhile have successfully set the narrative that Labour caused the financial crisis by over-spending, and that they lost the election by being too left wing. This means Labour are forced by the narrative to go further right wing, which may well lose them their support in northern England and Wales as they try to out-Tory the Tories. This of course is win-win for the right: either Labour collapses and cannot get into power anymore, or they become just as right wing as the Tories. 

The only way Labour can really recover is if they can find a leader with enough charisma and backing from the press that they can re-take the narrative and turn it to their advantage. At the moment this looks about as likely as Nicola Sturgeon raising an army and marching on Downing Street.

The flaws in his style of government include:

a) The ruling class is prone to act in their own interests rather than those of the country (this happens to some extent with a democracy, except in a democracy the party still needs to do enough to be re-elected. In a platonic state there is no such limitation, and so such corruption will occur to a greater degree).

b) There is no effective way to select the ruling class that isn't prone to corruption (since one generation of rulers will want their successors to be ""people like us"", ideally their own family, and will use their power to distort the selection process to make sure this occurs).

Asgand said that, because 'real' job hunting won't be accepted by the JC, you have to ham it up for them.

Like I said, if you spend 35 hours making a handful of applications to realistic companies, the JC won't accept that, because it doesn't fit their broken model of what 'finding a job' is. From the JC perspective, you have to be searching for and getting the very first thing available, which means applying for rafts of menial jobs in your local area, and taking the first one you get. This presupposes that you will hassle local businesses constantly, that you will send your CV to hundreds of small local businesses, and that it will work.

You have to give them what they think they need, in order to get the benefits you are rightfully entitled to.

Realistically, for skilled jobs, you don't need to spend 35 hours a week.

Regardless here is what Wikipedia has to say about the Crown.

&gt; The Crown is a corporation sole that represents the legal embodiment of executive, legislative, or judicial governance. It developed first in the United Kingdom as a separation of the literal crown and property of the nation state from the person and personal property of the monarch

I.E. the whole point is that the land owned by the office of the Crown and the land owned by the royal family are not the same thing. The concept exists because the Crown is owned by the nation. The sitting monarch is just the person currently wearing it.

There is a pub here called the [Drawing Board](http://www.thedrawingboard.pub/) which is decorated with comics and stuff like that, might be a good place to organise some stuff. 

There is a strip club so if that ends up being requested you are covered.

You could go to [Morgan's Bar](http://www.restaurant23.co.uk/#!/index.php) (above Restaurant 23) for some classy (and bloody nice) cocktails and/or food.

Depending on when you are coming there might be some good live music on at the [Assembly.](http://www.leamingtonassembly.com/), often they have great cover bands.

There is a shop in town called [BAM!](http://www.bam-ccg.co.uk/), they sell Comic books, Merchandise, Collectables, Warhammer, as well as Board and Trading Card games but you can also stop in and play - perhaps you could speak to them ahead and get something set up.

There are a few pretty good vintage shops in town which you could always drop into when passing by, might be a good time to pic up some embarrassing attire for the rest of the evening.

The new poor laws (1930's) restricted the aid and led to private charities encompassing more people, and forced lots of people to accept work in factories, mills and workhouses.

This didn't stop a massive chunk of people living in poverty, and opinion gradually shifted following reports by charities in the latter half of the century. This eventually led to the formation of the Labour party and then the reforms which formed the basis of the welfare state in the early 29th century.

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"&gt; but surely there's an argument to be made that a government with a cohesive ideology throughout it's policy might do a better job than one where four or five ideologically alien parties all have input into different areas? 

5 year electoral periods aren't long enough for ""cohesive ideology"" - the two-party system is fundamentally antagonistic, and successive governments always sabotage their predecessors' programmes.

They can't do that so easily with well established institutions, because too much is invested in them already -  they've proved their success and may even be well-loved (the iconic example would be the NHS, I guess), so each new government dismantles the most recent of its predecessors policies. 

Thus the only policies that have the opportunity to reach fruition are those initiated by a party in its first term of government, providing the party wins second or third terms. 

This is a gross generalisation, but where it's untrue is the centre ground, as labour become tory lite and the Call Me Dave appeals to ""hard working people like you and me"" to try and win labour voters. So this is the opposite of the ""strong ideology"" that you claim.

Government should be about our representatives working together to achieve the best for all of us - that's where cooperation, concessions and consensus all come into play. Our political parties should be saying to each other ""we'll give you this, if you'll give us that, but we both want this other thing"".

If we had 4 or 5 different parties forming coalitions then we'd have ministers from the last government becoming a minor partner in the new one - that would mean that they could say ""ok, you can scrap this because we know it's been a failure, but we need to keep this other policy and here's why"".

null,false,Jora_,null,null,null,"Some info for you based on my experiences:

- Bad news first: you almost certainly have hayfever and not a cold (the ""itchy roof of the mouth"" feeling is a fairly reliable indicator).

- Over-the-counter medicines do work to an extent, but don't expect the symptoms to totally disappear. Experiment with different medicines and see which works for you. Don't be afraid to try nasal sprays and eye drops either.

- Your hayfever season, if its starting now, is almost certainly grass related and you expect it to last 2-3 weeks. 

- Some days will be worse, some will be better. 

- Similarly some years will be worse, some better. In 2010 I was barely able to function as a human being for about 2 weeks. The following year I was totally fine. This year will probably be about average as we had a relatively wet spring. A couple of years ago we had an incredibly hot, dry spring and all the grass started dying off. I had a hayfever free summer as a result. It was awesome.

- You'll probably find that if you take 1-2 tablets a day for a few weeks you're going to start feeling burnt out and run down. This is anecdotal but I kind of get this burnt out, 'chemically' feeling after a few weeks on the piriton. So my advice is that you taken them only when symptoms become truly unbearable, don't pop them like skittles.

- As others have said keep windows shut especially during the morning and evening and on cool, dry days. When it rains pollen counts tend to drop - perfect time to open them up and get some fresh air in. Showering before bed and changing sheets once a week is also great advice. Be aware though that eventually the pollen *is* going to get everywhere. Just do what you can to minimise your exposure.

- Drink lots and lots of water. Again anecdotal but I find symptoms are worse when dehydrated.

- Slightly related but bear in mind that beer and some other alcohol contains histamine which will exacerbate symptoms.

- The final bit of advice is one I try to follow every year: don't let the hayfever get you down. Its easy to wallow and feel like crap and let it ruin your summer. I might end up feeling like crap with burning red eyes but I'm not going to sacrifice going to a beer garden with mates, or getting down the gym, or generally enjoying summer. Its an attitude thing but a lot of people let hayfever control their summer and I refuse to let that happen to me.

Thanks for the response. My line of thought though, is that the scenario you describe here wouldn't happen. Firstly, the users post who-related stuff in the first place. Secondly, if its off-topic and unpopular for that reason, then it will be voted down. 

Thirdly, on balance I think I'd modify rule 4 to say something like ""All items submitted must be connected to Doctor Who to a reasonable degree"".  This could be expanded with examples. For example, DW cast and production staff working on other relevant projects is acceptable, but stories about Star Trek with no DW particular DW connection would not be.

I have had lots of items removed over the years, in many subreddits. I usually concur with what the mods of those other subreddits have decided, because I haven't paid close attention to the problems that the subreddit had, which the rule in question treats. 

In the case of /r/doctorwho I have observed the effects of rule 4 and I have only ever seen damage, with quite good material removed, and happy discussions about DW by regular users being removed.

I worked for an Australian financials company that may or may not have sponsored the Sydney Olympics.

The end of month runs would take so long we'd have to run them over a weekend; start at 2pm on Saturday and finish around 8pm on a Sunday.

I'll go for pissing you off: it surprised me how easy it was for me. I have 14 months experience (hooray, placement) so I guess that's the big swinging factor. I'm also in a physical science so competition tends to be limited to those in your field, as opposed to everyone graduating. Still, I was expecting it to be a pain in the arse. Seems it's taking me longer trying to find somewhere to live than it took me to get the job ¬_¬


Out of the three offers: two were handled by recruiters (the third being the company I did my placement with). One of those offers came from a company *I didn't even apply for* the recruiter just rang me up and told me someone wanted to interview me, do I fancy it? Alright sure. So yeah, agencies. 


Also: relocation. If you can't relocate then you're screwing yourself massively. Unless you have any immediate family emergencies/dependants i'd recommend biting the bullet for a couple of years and just going to live somewhere else - wherever.

And besides no matter where the money's going, those soldiers aren't getting proper safety equipment anyway. And of course every election means apparently loads of money set aside for the NHS so presumably that baby should be getting new medical tech with each successive government.

The third person winning is an obfuscation, it's based on preference, they'd have to be selected to win. So they'd have won based not the first preference of some voters but maybe their second, third, fourth and somewhere a lot of people's choices would line up to crown a winner. Quite a few people would have a say in the winner. It would have just provided more of a chance to certain different parties than what we're used to.

And the fact it's only used in Papua New Guinea, Australia and Fiji, well -- that's really the fault of the conservatives to begin with, since at negotiations with the Lib Dems, they wanted an option not quite as strong as proper PR - which is more widespread. But the fact it's not common is not a good argument, it has to be a question of quality.

Counting may take days, but in a system that uses outmoded and labourious models and traditions, the conservatives are going to argue a question of timing is crucial?

And finally BNP supporters would have their vote counted again and again to make a majority so someone who they wanted would win, it's not just likely to be the BNP. Especially now.

I don't like AV, I didn't like it as a choice because it was a limited form of PR that barely is the real deal, but that poster is just shit, it's about as piss weak as AV is, frankly.

No, not every site that references homosexuality is banned with a big Great Firewall of China style error message. I'm sure if I want to be able to learn how to tie dye ribbons in the pretty colours of bisexuality, I will be able to do so elsewhere. I'm not claiming that we have turned into a fascist police state and that homosexuality is being erased in front of our eyes over night.

However, as I clearly stated in my answer to Tomwhatshisname, there are broader issues about broadband companies using clunky, catch-all algorithms that pick up the word 'sex' in bisexuality or homosexuality community and block it. That online subcultures (that are a lifeline to many young people) will be inadvertently blocked because the systems in place can't distinguish between the sex in 'sexuality' and the sex in a hardcore pornographic film description. It applies to countless areas of the Internet, it just so happens that the bisexuality issue cropped up for me today.

I don't know why you have to be so on the offensive and imply that I'm solely making it about those annoying gays again. I feel like this is a perfectly legitimate issue that doesn't just affect bi teens, but any teens. It just so happens that this was the example used because it happened to me today and was extremely frustrating and frankly, in the moment, offensive.

So from your apparent offence that I dare imply catch-all 'shields' imposed by my broadband provider are unwanted, potentially damaging to online freedoms and significantly affect the Internet and its users, can I assume you are in favour of them? If you are, please tell me why? I'd be interested to consider something I'm missing.

1. I'm not sure what the triple action face wash is like, but if you're open to switching you may be interested in Simple's ""refreshing facial wash gel"" instead - it's quite a gentle cleanser that has a pH of 5.5, so it's perfect for cleansing your skin without stripping, or disrupting your barrier. Cheap, too. This has helped my skin immensely with regards to keeping it free of dryness and helping with healing. There are a few other reviews for this product in here: http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2icnkb/the_cleanser_reviews/

2. I used to use the Purifying Cleansing Lotion as well, then I ran it through Cosdna (a popular website which analyses product ingredients) and saw that there are a couple of potentially problematic ingredients in it that can lead to clogging if you're sensitive. May be worth bearing in mind. 

3. The facial toner is quite nice and has niacinamide, so should help keep your skin calm. A few people in this sub seem to enjoy this and you can read other reviews for it here: http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2gvut7/the_niacinamide_reviews/

I had a candidate once tell me he might take my offer but only once he'd heard he hadn't got something else.

signing clyne, might have some additional knock on effects for us, one of them i see is a comfort of playing with lovren and lallana. if we get clyne locked up, we'll have addressed a number of key areas for us through clyne, milner, ings and bogdan. then we can focus on selling dead wood and trying to sign another striker who can hit the ground running and kovacic/firmino type signing. 

as far as dead wood goes, i think/know the following players are gone: 
1. rickie

4. brad jones 
5. enrique 
6. borini 
7. iago 
8. alberto

11. skrtel 

in that list above, players like sterling and skrtel i also think could stay, but they have a higher chance of being gone this summer. 

anyways if we can recoup around 60-70m for outbounds and have brought in ings, milner, bogdan and clyne for around 25m in signing fees, that would leave us 35-45 for a striker and a playmaker. perfect window.

Frankly I think Jordan is exactly the sort of player who would benefit from the increased responsibility and use it to up his game. Any of you lads who play sport ever notice this? That certain players, when given a degree of respect and responsibility, rise to the occasion. I was at least that way. Never felt right asserting myself on affairs when I wasn't given the armband but the minute I was it was like you injected me with some serum. 

I see Hendo as exactly that sort of player. Skrtel I don't. Lucas I don't. Down the line I think we have a lot of our established players as guys who will show up and put their shift in regardless of the armband. In a lot of ways I think Stevie was actually that type. He deserved the armband but he was a lead by example type. Almost like Suarez. You seem him busting ass so you do as well. Hendo I think is both that sort of player but also a natural leader in the vein of Carragher. You always understood why Gerrard was captain. But I also think most would agree that Carragher probably was more cut for that cloth.

Also, wasn't it Carragher who made a joke about how Hendo was a very serious young lad? That might be true but its the sort of thing that young players benefit from having around.

I'm pretty sure the name was ""Chocolate Danish"", and I think there was a pecan version too. It's hard to describe what it tasted like because there's nothing similar, it wasn't like a danish pastry. It was this soft doughy dish that had seams of chocolate running through it, the chocolate wasn't runny it was more paste. The top was covered in chocolate sauce. I didn't have a dessert as nice as that until I tried Farmhouse Fares sticky toffee pudding. 

I did some searching and apparently Sara Lee sold their UK factory in 2001 to an Irish company who went bankrupt in 2003. They did make own brand products so it seems likely they made the M&amp;S version too.

Only other right winger with Sterling's combination of skill, youth, and potential right now is Lucas IMO and he would be much more expensive. 

Also, I don't think that we will should after KDB if we get Sterling and Pogba. Adding KDB will create a logjam in midfield and I don't think we need another attacking midfielder.

null,false,segagamer,eng-Surrey,Croydon,null,"&gt; They prey on those who dont know better, up sell unnecessary crap, and are unable to provide the most basic customer service. **Its a scummy ethos which im sure head office are pushing.**

I haven't worked there since maybe 8 years ago I think, but this was definitely the case. I worked in the ""Tech Guys"" department of the Croydon PC World for 3 years and got fired for helping customers too much without charging, therefore not meeting my targets. Got into an argument 
about my targets because I was processing too many refunds and not enough sales. *In the customer service department*. 

My argument was that I can't approach anyone, and that if the sales team were doing there jobs properly, then I shouldn't be getting as many returns in the first place, and how I found it completely ridiculous that I was meant to charge someone £30 for showing her how to drag the taskbar down from the top of the screen and locking it. *It would have taken me far more time to justify the charge to the customer than it would to just simply do it and move on to the next*, and how returning customers are far more important than quick bucks.

I gained a whole lot of experience there which I'm grateful for, and a whole lot of knowledge which has helped with my current job (particularly people skills), but their head office contained some of the worst kind of humans possible who didn't know how to manage *their own* staff. I'm glad to see the Dixons group struggling these days, and look forward to John Lewis moving in to Croydon, so that I never have to buy appliances from Curry's again.

There's nothing new about the East being solidly blue. After the last elections the Tories held [52 of 58 seats](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/generalelection/focus-on-the-east-of-england/) in the East of England. Now the Tories hold ... [52 of 58 seats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MPs_for_constituencies_in_England_2015) in the East of England. The Lib-Dems committing hara-kiri led them to lose three of their four seats in the area, and Labour picked up two of those three. And in 2005, when Labour won the general elections? The Tories still won 40 out of 56 seats in East of England.

&gt; the Scots stopped counting as ""core labour voters"" after they started whingeing about the 'London Parties' and refused to vote for any pro-unionist parties.

That's the spirit - nothing like insulting the voters who left you to get them back. 

I just have to wonder about the strategy here. How is it good politics to deal with a stinging defeat by telling the region where you used to have 41 seats, and lost 40 of them, to piss off already - and somehow hoping you can compensate for that loss by appealing to voters in regions like the East of England, which is known for being a Conservative bastion where Labour had only 13 seats even when it still won the elections?

It's not that Hodges doesn't have any kind of a point here: We all need to be aware of our in-built prejudices and as a party of social justice, we need to be especially aware of it. And this is exactly why we have all-women shortlists and other rules to make sure minorities are represented. We should be changing the rules of our leadership elections to reflect that and I think it's likely that we will (someone proposed a rule-change to make sure that if the leader's a man the deputy must be female and I suspect that will be approved).

Like I say, Hodges does have a point, but as all too often, he's writing for his 'Theoretically left-wing but anti-Labour' paycheque. Particularly when talking about the mayoral elections, it's hard to know what to make of his arguments, exactly: We already have rules to make sure the ticket is diverse (and so it is). But that doesn't mean we *absolutely have to* then elect one of the BAME or female candidates and he totally skims over the fact that, should Tessa win, she'll be the first female candidate for London Mayor from any major party and likely the first female Mayor of London. He also says nothing about the other major party's selection processes or how likely they are to field female and/or minority candidates: I suspect the answer is 'not very', except in the case of the Greens, who will almost certainly field a woman.

I'm pretty active on there, and it's been a really nice environment for me - because I cultivate and prune who I follow or interact with, and I don't make a big enough fuss of myself to attract anon hate. If someone I follow is getting relentlessly negative and unpleasant, I'll ask if they're okay, and then I'll unfollow so I don't have to deal with their bullshit if they're just being unreasonable. I've even made quite a few IRL friends through that site! 

A lot of fandoms will also have a generally widespread policy to try and look after young users - ie, tagging anything NSFW clearly, discussing why it's a bad idea for underage users to try and flirt with adults, discussing how to watch out for potential grooming or abusive users who encourage unhealthy behaviours, and so on. Tumblr's no worse than reddit, generally, since it operates very very very little content control and leaves things in the hands of the users as much as possible. Thankfully they've finally implemented better block functions so you can prevent anon harassment and block logged in users, too.

The bits of the site that get cherrypicked and posted to the likes of tumblrinaction are generally about as representative of the platform as redpill is of reddit - a tiny minority of crazies, plus a bunch of satirists who are being taken too seriously. (this isn't to say the crazies don't exist - they do - but any comment thread on a crazy post will generally have a lot of people calling it out as utter bullshit)

Coutinho would be more inclined to cut into the middle to play in the strikers, and Milner could cover for the width. Sturridge would sit slightly off Benteke to pick up Benteke's knock downs, and run at defenders with his pace and skill. Sturridge could also drift wide if the situation demanded it. 

Milner and Henderson would be the engines either side of a holding midfielder to support in attack and defense.

null,false,almodozo,null,null,null,"&gt; The scots voted for the SNP because they lost the independence referendum not because they voted Left. They voted for UKIP because they don't like Europe not because they voted Right.

The SNP managed to win swathes of Labour heartland for its causes (including independence) by reinventing itself as a left-wing sounding, anti-austerity party. UKIP won over Labour voters who are afraid of globalization, immigration, and economic insecurity. Neither constituency will be won back by being more ""pro-business"" and ""aspirational"".

Yes, of course - if Labour is to win an election again it also needs to steal some voters away from the Tories. But winning over some wet middle-class Tories isn't going to do the party any good if it's bleeding a much larger number of working class voters to the SNP and UKIP (and lefties to the Greens) at the same time. 

Even Blair didn't get close to winning a majority of seats in East of England. You can get some seats there to push you over the edge but they won't do any good if a larger number of seats elsewhere is breaking away underneath. Labour lost 40 seats in Scotland. (Hell, even the little Greens might have cost Labour [up to 10 seats](http://psythor.tumblr.com/post/119053460850/if-just-2984-green-voters-had-gone-with-labour).) There aren't enough ""pro-business"" minded constituencies that might countenance voting Labour in places like East Anglia to make up for that.

This defeat was bad enough that Labour needs to consolidate first and stop the bleeding in the demographic constituencies that form its critical mass. The alternative, ""fleeing forward"" into a kind of neo-Blairism while telling Scottish and other former Labour voters of the 'wrong kind' to piss off, might win you back some favour among the press corps and media pundits and some uncertain number of voters in traditional swing seats. But the strategy of tailoring your policies entirely to soft Tories and assuming that your own voters will just stick with you out of apathy or lack of alternative does not work anymore in what has functionally become a multi-party landscape, featuring a mighty SNP, a strong UKIP, active Greens and whatever else might come along.",null,0,null,1434555594,null,0,false,0,cs9n2s8,null,t3_3a2iyt,null,t1_cs9n2s8,null,t1_cs9h75w,null,null,null,1437139756,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

His strength, control, pace, etc are up there for sure. Physically he's a strong lad too and well suited to the Premier League.

The problem lies in his inability to understand these strengths in the right areas of the pitch. He seemingly has little ability to understand roles or the bigger team picture. He wanders about looking for the ball when he's supposed to be working the line up top. He slows the play down when we're attempting to fast break. He dribbles into trouble when he should be passing it off and using his pace to make space or look in behind. These mental shortcomings blunted any effectiveness his skillset should provide.

He's shown to be a hard worker off the ball, but all that effort seems to be in the wrong direction for the system we were playing with. Instead of conserving his energy and playing on the shoulders of defenders looking for through balls from Hendo and Couts, he was busting lungs hustling fullbacks and then walking aimlessly back.

At the minute that is the biggest issue between the parties. They'd probably be arguing anyway but the economy definitely has the politicians and the populace worried. You can't discuss around money. Your country either has it or doesn't.

&gt; Do regular people (not politicians) argue about it a lot and is there resentment between the opposing sides or is it all in good fun debating?

There is a small core of people in the nationalist and unionist communities who base their entire identity on their political affiliation and their sectarian opposition to the other. Talking with these people is usually pointless. They'll just yell about how evil the other side is and come across as rather brainwashed. They tend to be from poorer backgrounds (but not always).

Most of the people living here just want to 'get on with things'. People are rather cynical when it comes to the politicians and don't think things will get better. I saw  polls awhile back showing Unionists believe the Nationalists will win with their overarching goals and Nationalists believe the Unionists will win with their overarching goals. Some people avoid talking about politics because it's a touchy subject. Areas still remain divided by politics and religious background.
