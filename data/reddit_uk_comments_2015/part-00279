The idea that every individual is autonomous and responsible for their own journey through life, is a core principle of this outlook. The Thatcherite tradition conservative party - as opposed to marginally more community minded pre-Thatcher conservative party - holds very closely to this ideological standpoint. By cutting welfare and credits to the poor, Cameron not only believes he will be better allocating potential business driving resources, but that he will also remove any dependencies which are making the poor ""lazy"", ""feckless"", ""scroungers"", or the classic victorian ""undeserving"". He also has no qualms dolling out large sums to his wealthy friends, as - in line with the ideology - they have a high socioeconomic standing, and will surely be the kind of people we wish to reward for their entrepreneurialism. In this sense it is not Cameron who ""hates the poor"", it is the ideological altar from which he is preaching which hates the poor. The class war mentioned in the parent comment is attempting to describe not some irrational dislike for people with less than him, but the ruthless adherence to a doctrine that makes people's lives worse, and benefits only the few - from the perspective of those who disagree with neoliberal /thatcherite /randian /nozickian /whatever-you-want-to-call-it perspectives.

None of this is new, nor is it contentious. My personal recommendation for an analysis of whether we call Cameron and IDS' assault on the poor and the welfare state ""class war"", would be *The Underclass*(1990?)  or *The Underclass Revisited* (1999?) by Charles Murray - a member of the New Right school of thought, and practically Thatcher's personal sociologist. That would give you a deeper understanding of the different motivations in play in Cameron's decision making. You can then decide whether you'd call it class war.

Britain's economy is not in a good way (high household debt etc). The Conservative government are trying to tackle Britain's productivity gap (5th out of the G7) but only a few of their movements so far add up to solving that problem. The higher living wage will push businesses to spend more on technology to solve their problems than hire people - businesses chose to do the latter during the recession which has hampered productivity even more. It's no longer about doing what is best for individual voters but much broader reforms to the employment structure of the country. That's what I was getting at when I referenced Thatcher's first term. The problem is that there's no post-industrial nirvana and with rising costs in higher education there is a decreasing resilience of Britain's workforce in the long term. While paying lipservice to UKIP voters, they don't give a fudge about 'native' Brits at all. They know Britain's future prosperity has to come from abroad and are spending their energies pushing in that direction.

This reads like a Daily Mail article. There's just too many hyperboles without evidence.

I'll start:

&gt;I gotta tell you guys, I am genuinely worried about the state of immigration into the UK. The amount of people that have come from eastern Europe over the last 20 years, the constant arrivals from Asia and Africa, there are parts of this country that are unrecognisable. All we see is division between the races, not much getting along. I am sure you have heard this argument before, right?

Yup, you've got that one right. I've heard of this argument. Know what? It happened because of white flight.

Was white flight done on purpose to avoid immigration? No. It was done because they had much better jobs. The left over were white chavs who moved over to outskirts of a large city or to some other town with 99% white population? Guess why? Because property prices have risen enough to drive the white chavs out but not immigrants who are perfectly happy with terraced house built before the world war.

There are still many white british who live in ghetto who aren't a chav.

&gt;We British were not a particularly friendly bunch to begin with, but the amount of new arrivals now is just making it worse by the day. ""We British"" I say, I am the daughter of immigrants, grandmother from Ireland, father from middle east 30 years ago; make of that whatever you like. I do not have a problem with say a Polish person, Polish are nice people, but I do have a problem with 1,000,000 Polish people. As for the people from cultures further afield, well, I do not like those cultures frankly, and I do not want to live with it.

Where were you when Normans and Saxons came? Culture, despite many people claiming, is not fixed. It changes over time. If you don't want Polish culture, do your bit to keep it. Nobody is forcing you to give your culture up. As long as it doesn't violate the laws, all cultures is welcome. Unsavoury bits of imported culture will be taken over by superior ones over time.

The result is a melting pot of cultures.

&gt;The media focuses the eyes of the people on Calais, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. Nothing will stop the waves of people coming from Africa, and the waves are going to get bigger over time. The population of Africa is set to grow hugely this century, to 2 billion+. If you think there has been too much immigration so far, well my friend you aint seen nothing yet! You think those 2 billion Africans are going to want to stay in Africa? You think the boats headed towards Europe are a problem now?! Oh my poor deluded little lambs. Look at the size of the sea border at the bottom of Europe, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey soon to become an EU member too! Oh goody. Unless Europe literally builds a wall around itself it is going to be overrun. White flight is not just going to be something that happens in local regions, but I genuinely believe it is something that is going to happen from Europe as a whole. Those that can afford to leave will leave, so start saving your pennies.

You speak of issues in Africa like you're an expert. Guess what? You're not.

It just happens that I'm an African. Do I agree with you? Heck no. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa is improving all time since that time colonialism screwed them over and still screws them to this day.

Did you see many immigrants from Nigeria? Me neither. Why? Because they're actually a quite nice country to live in. Mass immigration happen whenever a conflict that causes them to leave. Immigrants leaving for money is rare.

&gt;Do not make the mistake of thinking that it is just because of the destabilisation in Libya etc, what we are seeing now is small potatoes compared to what Europe will see over the coming decades. This is the beginning. Again, I do not have a problem with you, Mr Nigerian man, but I do have a problem with millions of African migrants, because I do not want to live with that culture, I want to live in the culture that I grew up with.

You can have your own culture. Nobody is forcing you to give it up.

The only reason destabilisation happened in those countries was because of ineffective government and corruption. Do you really think those immigrants want to overthrow a government? They know their place and they want to live along the rest. Only time they will raise is the time when government screws them over severely restricting them from whatever they've been doing for ages. Even then they much rather go somewhere else. There's plenty of cases where immigrant left their host country because of increasing difficulties to continue living normally.

&gt;Calais is just a part of the problem. There are many ways into the UK that are perfectly legal. For example, big companies like BT (I know for sure), keeps its computing costs down by bringing in workers from India rather than hiring UK graduates. The Indians are highly skilled and happy to work for minimum wage, where the UK natives do not want to live 5-to-a-house, and the UK guys and girls need to earn more to have a chance at getting a house in the UK and making a life for themselves. All these big companies are at this game.

The government could have raised the minimum wage. They didn't.

Bringing the workers over because it's cheaper is illegal. You need to prove that you can't find an EU worker before bringing somebody in.

&gt;The Indians etc are happy to save up for a few years and head home with their pockets full, and that money goes a long way in India. Not just Indians of course, many people do this, eastern Europeans too. I would do exactly the same in their shoes, who wouldnt? I just think that this kind of migrant population that has no plan to stay, no plan to integrate, just causes problems for the natives. Sometimes people say that the English migrate abroad themselves, and while this is true, the migrating English usually have money in their pockets and are looking to spend, rather than the average Pole who is relatively poor, and looking to earn. What a Joke. How many English do you know who are boarding trains to Poland to earn money there, in order to learn polish, and use polish hospitals? Never going to happen.

They pay taxes. They contribute to local economy. They contribute to population by working in jobs that benefit the population e.g. social health workers.

&gt;And as for those migrants who choose to stay. Well, they head to their local ""ghetto"" where they can speak their own language and eat their own food, and carry on as usual. What does this bring to the UK, what benefit does this create for the UK? Once they are settled of course it is easy to bring over relatives, or anyone else who wants to pay you cash and pretend they are your relative. In Africa it is not like the UK, getting a birth certificate is as easy as bribing the local office 50 quid, and this certificate is then used to ""prove"" A is the relative of B, and they too are granted permission to enter the UK. It is big business, there are companies that exist with the sole purpose of getting people in to the UK, or the US, or wherever else. With so many legal ways in to the UK, even for non-Europeans, I wonder what those idiots at Calais are doing?!

It's not easy to bring a relative over. I'm sure many British people here with foreign SOs (married or not) can attest to that.

&gt;I understand that some people like the idea of multiculturalism, I accept that, but you guys need to grant the same respect to us that do not like it. I do not like living in this cultural soup, I want to live around people who speak the same language, not necessarily English mind you, but the same language; I want to live in a society where everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet. I have lived in a culturally homogeneous country and found it to be more relaxed, more polite, safer, cleaner .... better. Coming back to the UK has been a nightmare, but at least now I know there is hope. Its funny that I feel like I have to escape this country, to go abroad and become a foreigner, piss off the locals in another place, and all because my own country has too many foreigners.

Hmm.

I visited an African country. The country's capital had over 10-20 different ethnic groups living there and each one group had a significant proportion. Every single of them got along fine despite different languages between them, despite having only one national language and despite having different religions.

Why can't this happen in the UK? 

&gt;The migrants come the UK to save money, go back home and live like kings, well I say, if you can't beat them, join them. I have started saving money to leave the UK, as I think it this land is already too far gone to be saved, and it is only going to get way worse. I could be wrong about all of this, but I am not taking any chances. Start saving your money before it is too late, UK.

I think, and am pretty willing to be shown that I'm wrong about this, that it might be something systematic about our governmental system. The current voting system *tends* to lead to majorities for the two major parties, rather than incentive to compromise between MPs. 

I mean, no one in government has an incentive (except for from the good of their very soul, against their own career interests) to do really hard, ground-up, long-term reforms of anything because it's always going to be partisan, and undone by the next government -- or, doesn't have easily demonstrable short-term benefits that can be used to persuade voters five years down the line. 

I agree, but I feel like throwing your arms up and saying that's the way of it is maybe ignoring systematic problems in the way our politics works. Maybe there isn't a good solution to the voting system. But I don't think our current system allows reasonable action against these sort of issues. All solutions seem short-term and populist.

Yes, UKIP (and the rest of the lunatic fringe) having a bunch of MPs would be 'fair'.  It would also be pointless.  The reason they have no MPs is because they can't present a policy slate any UK constituency will vote for, except in one case where the candidate was a sitting MP.  They will never, under any voting system, come close to getting a majority in *any* voting system.

It was a common thing for many of the patients to go out into the garden and grow their own flowers.

  One day a police officer came into the unit (many of the patients were known to the police for drugs/drink as well as suicide attempts and other stuff). He was walking around this garden area when he asked my grandmother ""why is there a cannabis plant in the pot there?"" Now bear in mind this was a small town where drugs were virtually unheard of, and so my grandmother had no clue what he was referring to. It turned out it was a common added seed in bird feed at the time, and in this case it had sprouted and grown in this pot quite happily.

I'm not dissing voters, nor am I suggesting we don't listen to them.  They have real concerns, and they deserve to be addressed, but the consensus as to how to address them is something that I think Labour could and should challenge.

For example, the electorate want a strong economy--of course they do--, they don't trust Labour to deliver one (given how we couldn't decide whether we were right or wrong in government, who blames them?), but the received wisdom is that austerity is the way to go to be credible on the economy.  Labour could, I think, legitimately argue that the better way to obtain a stronger economy is to fund growth and public works.  They can point both to the opinions of various economists who have said as much (admittedly I have no citations, unless Yanis Varoufakis counts!), and also to the effect of austerity on countries like Greece.  Of course, the electorate at large probably won't be convinced outright, but it's the start of challenging the consensus.

I don't think there's a dichotomy between _good_ respecting the electorate by taking all of their views as gospel, or _bad_ treating the electorate like idiots by ignoring and shouting over them.  Nor do I think we can get away without separating fundamental concerns (such as the economy) from perceptions (such as Labour being bad at the economy) and currently accepted solutions (such as austerity).

As for slavery, meh, I got my history wrong I guess.  But shouldn't we be trying to encourage public pressure against social wrongs, instead of deciding that since the policies making them are currently 'in' they must be correct?",null,0,null,1437513331,null,0,false,0,ctbcuy7,null,t3_3e3k0u,null,t1_ctbcuy7,null,t1_ctb7qoh,null,null,null,1438068812,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

null,false,TwistTurtle,uk,London,null,"Modern day Drag Queens are a form of entertainer - not always comedy, such as Conchita Wurst, who is a singer, but usually comedy related. For most Drag Queens, it is purely a performance, like a play or a sketch - they get up on stage and go through whatever motions they've planned and then they take off the gown afterwards. I'd say Paul O'Grady/Lily Savage is probably the best example of this.  

However, what's becoming more popular lately are lifestyle Drag Queens - these are acts that make an entirely separate persona that they basically try to make as real (in a very overdramatic fashion) as possible. Most of the famous Drag Race Queens are like this - RuPaul, Courtney Act, Willem, Alaska Thunderfuck 5000, etc.. For them, it's much less a performance and more of a full on career or lifestyle. RuPaul is responsible for most of its modern day popularity, but it's been around for quite some time now. See the film 'Priscilla: Queen of the Desert' for a good example of pre-Drag Race lifestyle Queens. Also see it because it's just an excellent film with unexpectedly brilliant actors in the main roles.  

Both of these have absolutely nothing inherently to do with transexuality - which is simply a person who feels that their gender identity doesn't match their biological gender (to oversimplify it slightly).

Labour got some things wrong - for example why were we giving tax credits to people earning over £50k? This is a waste of tax money. When the Conservatives took away child benefit for higher rate taxpayers, they grumbled - but there was no backlash.

We need to be really careful here - we don't know how this welfare change will work out in practice. It'll pan out in two ways - it will force employers to pay more and people off the welfare roll, or it will cause suffering. We simply don't know.

I graduated with the MEng Software Engineering from HW 5 years ago.

Here's how I did it:

* I started with 6 months on BSc Web Design and Development at RGU (less strict entrance requirements - had to do a summer access course before they'd let me on this). 
* After the first term my grades were good enough to transfer to the BSc Computer Science course at RGU.
* At the end of my first year at RGU my grades were good enough to transfer to HW, directly into second year on the BSc Computer Science course.
* My grades at HW on the BSc Computer Science course were good enough that I was able to apply for the MEng during the third year (the first 3 years of the BSc Computer Science and the MEng Software Engineering courses are the same - during the 3rd year students are selected for the the last 2 years of the MEng course based on grades and interviews with representatives from industry). 
* I ended up graduating with the MEng Software Engineering with Distinction.

I didn't actually plan any of it out that way, it just sort of happened.

I'd recommend contacting HW directly though - they were really helpful when I was a student. And since the first 3 years of the BSc Computer Science and the MEng Software Engineering are the same if they aren't willing to relax the entrance requirements for the MEng you should try and get on the BSc course instead (they might be more willing to relax entrance requirements for that course), you can always transfer later.

Benito Carbone from 35 yards, in front of the Holte End. Game was against Leeds in the FA Cup en route to Wembley in 2000. It was a five-goal thriller, we came back from 2-1 down, atmosphere was incredible, Holte at its best. 


Carbone scored a hatrick. This one was technically his best, but I actually think the third was my favourite - Merson made a great run into the box, chipped it and ran on and then made a brave header across the box for Carbone to knock home. The roof came off, as did Carbone's shirt as he whirled it around his head. Merson had been clattered in the head by Duberry (I think) when he won the header. He had blood pouring down his face and was stumbling around the sideline trying to come back on, but medical staff dragged him off and he went to hospital on a stretcher. Later said he didn't even realise we'd scored as he'd been knocked out.

[Massive disclaimer, benefit stuff is far from my speciality.]

If you're not getting this, you might want to do some prodding - the Government used to have a nice benefit-calculator thing, but now they're redirecting people to 3rd party ones (including the one I just used). If you're not sure about that, maybe see if you can talk to someone at CAS or something like that. Of course, given that tax credits are on the way out, and can't be back-dated much, they may not be able to help.

Anyway...

The stuff that would bump this up further would be housing benefit (up to £250ish for a 1-bed place, £300ish for 2 bedrooms), ESA (around £100 if even DWP's people had to admit you were unfit for work), and extra child tax credits if - in the example I used above - a child was disabled as well (£60-85).

As for why you want to work, I guess one of the advantages is you don't have to worry that you'll wake up tomorrow to find the government has changed to rules and is taking away 10% of your income.

I disagree entirely with this, and they were certainly never set up on this sort of charitable basis.

Council houses for example were available to middle-class families right from the start. The NHS treats all patients as equal and doesn't restrict it's usage to the very poorest since all people, rich or poor, benefit from having a universal health system rather than a patchwork of competing private health insurance companies topped by  means tested healthcare (as they do in America with medicare and medicaid)

Pensions are as much a benefit as everything else, and people who pay taxes (and middle-class and wealthy people do pay a higher proportionate share of the nations tax income) should be entitled to use the services they pay for.

@DerelictMuntersnatch, here's my understanding of it. New Labour wanted to help people out of poverty but also wanted to be pro-business. Businesses don't want to pay a living wage as it increases their costs. So, aware of wanting to be seen as pro-business, New Labour topped up people's incomes with welfare spending. Nobody thought it was a problem because the economy was in pretty good shape and the government had money to spend. Even the Tories supported it. The 'subsidizing business' angle comes from the criticism that New Labour should have went against the business lobby and just raised the minimum wage to get people out of poverty.

The state of affairs now is as such: the Conservatives want to make welfare savings, they don't want to touch pensions, so they go for Tax Credits. However just cutting Tax Credits with no raise in the minimum wage would put hundreds of thousands in poverty. So they cut them while raising the minimum wage and the business lobby doesn't mind because its the 'pro-business' Conservatives doing it and not the 'tax and spend' Labour. Plus the business lobby is thrown the bone of corporation tax cuts, which while sounding nice doesn't actually save them much.

Why do you care about his wages? We should be buzzing to have two top class players in each position. 

&gt; Given our transfer record recently, I have every faith in our transfer dealings and can't see what all the fuss is about selling him. He just wasn't anything special. The board seem to know what they are doing.

I know he'll be replaced with another body; we will definitely get a new left back in if Luis was to go. However, at this moment in time, Luis is a better backup than Rahman. That's all that's been stated in this thread. It's not a forward move.

&gt; I guess it showed how complete our squad when people are arguing over second string. Why I don't see what the fuss is about. I can understand if it were Remy because he turned it on for us. Luis? Who cares?

I don't think anyone is having a meltdown over the sale. It is what it is. You seem to really be dis-crediting 'second string' players, but it's that depth which will win you titles in the end. The chances are, we will have to rely on these players at some point.

&gt; Now you are just stretching your arguments with Ake. Luis didn't even play 20+ games for us last year. He played 15. Fact was if he hadn't come with such a good rep, he prob would have played less. 

Actually, Luis played 24 times last season. You're probably looking at the league. And this is without (m)any injuries to our full-backs. 

&gt;And you seem to forget if there were ever a long term injury, pretty sure we can go out and buy in Jan. 

Where's the logic in that? So you acknowledge if we come unstuck with injuries, we will need someone to replace them. Why wait until it's potentially too late? It only takes one game to crash out of the CL or a cup competition.

People say ""he has a good work rate thats all he can do"" thats stupid, if he wasnt there winning the ball back for us half the the time you'd notice the difference and how much less possession we have. Aside from that he is brilliant on the ball (rarely loses it), hes got  pace and is our best player on the counter attack, he literally opens up the entire pitch when he breaks away. And hes got a good long ball in him too which we've seen when he switches play with Hazard. 

Should he score more goals? Yes im not going to defend him on that but I think he can improve his goal record. His assists? I think the number can improve too but ive said this another time the amount of times that he beats his man (despite his obvious trick) and gets the ball right across the face of goal with nobody there to tap it in is damaging his stats. which is why you shouldnt look at stats like you're doing. If Costa ran across the goal instead of pulling back every single time I can guarantee you he'd score more and Willian's assist number would go up. 

TLDR Willian is improving and hes just scoring goals more often away from being the complete player. Hes only 26 and we should actually let our players develop and become a perfect fit rather than idiots wanting to toss them away for any ""marquee"" name they see in the metro/express.

I was born around the same time and I still remember going with my Ma into Belfast city centre to do the shopping, and the sand bagged bunkers [and gates](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CH0CYtzWUAECAOI.jpg) that you had to pass by just to get into the city centre proper. I remember my Ma having to let the female police / or UDR greenfinches rummage through her bag while I went through another lane for the fellas.

It was known as the ""Ring Of Steel"" and it literally was a ring of steel in the beginning. Eventually it was replaced by manipulating the entire urban planning of Belfast and those yellow security barriers and hydraulic or lockable bollards.

London has a ring of steel too, to protect it from IRA bombs. But being the capital city of the UK, it couldn't be built like Belfast's, so they made it look pretty from the outset, while ours matured slowly.

null,false,ZiGraves,null,null,null,"I think it's meant to be more about the way that a lot of men use really coercive methods to get sex without even realising it might count as rape. /u/anna-belle said *""surely teaching boys what counts as sexual harassment and threatening behaviour is extremely valuable""*, and I think that's sort of the key part of the argument even if 'teach boys not to rape' is a kind of clumsy way to put it.

For example, when young boys act out and bully girls - pulling their hair, throwing stuff at them, etc - it gets treated as 'boys will be boys' or even 'he's only teasing you because he likes you'. When kids are that young, they're impressionable. It's easy to teach boys that being shitty to girls is how you get girls, or to teach girls that boys being shitty means they're actually into you.

Then you go on to the teen years, and boys learn that refusing to take 'no' for an answer is just shown as romantically persistent in media, and girls learn that 'no' doesn't always mean 'no' the same way. Only really physically violent assault where she's bleeding and crying gets counted as rape, but all that 'slap-slap-kiss' stuff where the guy pins her hands down and kisses her when she's angry at him is somehow romantic or sexy. They might get taught 'just say no' in school, but all the other social factors aren't addressed - constantly pushing at boundaries and bullying girls into giving in by constantly eroding their refusals bit by bit. Snapping her bra and flicking her skirt up to show her underwear is just 'boys being boys' and doesn't get treated like the variety of sexual harassment it is.

And later in your teens, it seems like it's okay to get a girl really drunk if you want to sleep with her. If she says 'no', you've been taught she's just playing hard to get so you should ignore that 'no' and just keep on pushing. You might not even think that what you're doing is deliberately wearing down her boundaries and taking away her ability to consent by getting her drunk and refusing to accept 'no', but what are her options? Socially exclude herself by refusing to ever socialise? Keep trying to refuse someone who's bigger and stronger than her and is clearly not accepting her refusal?

Then you're an adult and you've had two or more decades of learning that women saying 'no' is something you can ignore, and that it's a lot easier to get what you want when a woman is so drunk she can't really say 'no' properly anyway, and that it's funny and entertaining to tease women with sexual harassment jokes until they're upset.

I mean, if you've learned to avoid all of that then well done to you. But there are loads of men who haven't, and some of them don't realise that getting a woman so drunk that she's not able to refuse, never mind consent, is rape. There are others who don't take a woman's 'no' seriously, so if she refuses sex - and even if she cries - they don't categorise it as rape because women just play hard to get and cry all the time anyway.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;It's not builders that are the issue here, we don't have the manpower and people are hoarding land. This idea that the free market can build the amount of houses we need is absolutely, absolutely absurd they haven't ever achieved it and they were wrecked by the financial crash.

Private builders are doing what is in their interests and there's nothing wrong with that. Their interests extend to serving the top 40% of the housing market and nothing more; that's where the largest profits are. That's how it's always been in the UK going back to the 1940s. No amount of tinkering with planning law and buggering up housing associations is going to change that. We will not reach the levels of housebuilding we need without some kind of non-profit intervention, either through government or third parties.

Politically no party wants to be the one that brings down house prices. Homeowning voters feel good when house prices rise because they feel wealthier, even if that value is locked away in their home. A sensible thing to do would be to use recessions as an opportunity to build more housing. Prices would already be depressed and a jobs program to keep the housebuilding industry afloat when private capital is scarce is good for the economy. Our government took the opportunity to do approximately fuck all to take advantage of the 2008 recession other than to make some strategic loans to banks. We should have been building roads, bridges, pylons and laying fibre to homes and businesses.

A national land bank and better management of government owned land would allow a lot of flexibility to fit more people in where they want to be around the country. Not having right-to-buy on highrise council properties (or any...) would mean they could demolish buildings and replace them with incrementally higher densities when necessary without having to bugger around with compensation or compulsory purchase which is *very* distasteful politically. There are so many things they could do and are choosing not to do to fix housing. It's a noose around the neck of the nation and it's only getting tighter.

The problem is though that these sorts of classes are typically run by people associated with feminism, or gender studies and the like, who typically have strong opinions on gender issues which aren't shared by everyone.

Should consent be taught to children?  I dunno, perhaps.   But I'm very wary of this being used as a way to sneak ideological biases into the classroom.  In short - I don't trust feminists to stick to the science or the legal definitions and I would want to see an evidence based approach which doesn't discriminate against men.

Also, it's an uncomfortable fact that one of the easiest ways to prevent rape is to get women to take more precautions in their behavior - i.e. limit their drinking and don't take unnecessary risks when out alone.  

To emphasize - I'm *not* commenting on the morality here - I'm just talking about what actually works.

No, it only causes the symptoms to get worse for people who are ALREADY suffering with it. If you don't have it, you won't get it by smoking weed. 

By legalising it, you can both tax it (and generate revenue to the government) and also undercut many dealers and so you'll end up actually reducing crime rate.

We sold Mata too who is a way better player than Luis ever going to be but it was better for the team.

I haven't seen anything about Rahman so I can't judge but I don't rate Luis.  He just didn't cut it for us last year.  He was pretty average to spill your milk over.

We have had the best squad we have had in years and you are crying like some entitled new fan.  If you had to watch Chelsea pre Roman days, you might have had to slit your wrist.

Why don't you trust our board who has shown how competent they have been?  In fact I can't think of a club that has had better transfers dealings than us recently.

I can say I won't lose any sleep over any of our second string team leaving because they are replaceable.  Remy is the only one worth considering because he actually turned it in for us.  You keep saying How good Luis is but HE DIDNT TURN IT ON FOR US.  You might have a case if he was playing a blinder every game or if he has potential to turn out great but he is 29.

Team morale wins you titles too.  Mourinho likes to keep a smaller squad than average and he has won lots of titles.  We just won another one too without needing mad depth.

Our squad is fine.  Our depth is fine.  Last year I thought we completed our team and have never been happy in years.  Please tell me which year you think we have a better squad then now?  We have the strongest squad we have ever had but they are on the younger side but just need a bit of experience.  I can see us dominating with our squad now for years to come and can't wait to see him all in their prime.

If the question was has our transfer window been successful I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone who would say yes if the window closed tomorrow. For the reason you bring up specifically. We need more depth at forward positions, both on the wings and at forward. 

I have seen a few of your posts and you have a lot of love for the last generation of Spurs. Which I understand as they provided some great football for this club. This new team is quite different and will have some bigger strengths and some bigger weaknesses than those teams. But you can't build to be a past version of self. With the squad we have after last season this is the way forward. Building depth with young players with a high ceiling. After the new stadium we may not be able to spend freely in windows. The idea is to spend smart now so we don't have to compensate later. Spending big can go poorly. 

I was not around for the team that took Spurs to the Champions league. Or who came in 4th the year Chelsea won the cup. So I can view the team much more unbiasedly than comparing them to the old squad. We have promise. Something I didn't think Spurs had when I watched us against City and Liverpool at the beginning of the season last year. But towards the end I saw a team that with a few more pieces could be a solid team that may be able to steal *STEAL* a Champions league spot. I think SOME of those pieces have been acquired. So yes, again, the transfers have actually improved the team.

In other words, yes, capital gains on all profits via trading, investing or mining. There is a tax threshold so you wouldn't be taxed on all of it but you still should declare it on an annual personal tax form. 

If the figures are considerable, speak to an accountant, give them that link and they will be able to advise the best route without being specialists in digital currencies. It may be that setting up a company is a beneficial route for tax purposes, or it may be that to keep it simple you just declare the total profit on buying/selling on your annual form as capital gains.. however I don't think you can deduct hardware costs and running costs without it being a company.",null,0,null,1437519575,null,0,false,0,ctbgst9,null,t3_3dmgkm,null,t1_ctbgst9,null,t3_3dmgkm,null,null,null,1438071633,null,1,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,1,null

I still think it's important that universities remain places of shared and stored knowledge, research, innovation and cultural preservation, but even these aspects of university are ultimately investments. Not all the returns will necessarily be economic, but many will, and there is the more immediate effect of investing in the workforce by providing people with skills and knowledge that is useful (the ability to think critically, to communicate effectively, to solve complex problems, to apply mathematical knowledge in a financial or engineering setting, to write software etc.). 

There is little point in subsidising the degrees of loads of art history students if there are far more than we need to suitably preserve and curate art history in the country and the training process only qualifies you for low-skilled and low-paid work.

Disabled people are about half as likely to find employment as non-disabled people.

That Corbyn can't do that is even more obvious today than was the case for Ed Miliband five years ago - if he wins, the Conservatives will be in power until 2025 *at least*, thanks to the idiotic Fixed-Term Parliament Act's fixing the next set of elections' dates well in advance. That'll be almost long a period of continuous Conservative government as happened under Thatcher and Major combined - and we'll have the Labour Party's internal electorate to blame for choosing to retreat to their comfort zone of instinctive eighties-style Left politics instead of *actually making a difference to the country's government*.

Labour could eat itself alive with its ideological quibbling for all I care if we had a PR electoral system- but as things stand, the electoral system so utterly cripples *any* alternative that the responsibility for stopping another Conservative government lies *entirely* with the Labour party.

Borrowing at a time of low interest is not a bad thing, especially as it would (if invested well) lead to increased revenues and public debt is not an issue unless hugely out of control - which it isn't, and wouldn't be if we did borrow more. Printing money would be an option, and has been. Fiscal stimulus is a valid tactic, and works as long as the currency doesn't devalue too much, so it doesn't decrease private investment. At a time when inflation of goods prices is at a record, and relatively stable low, then this isn't such a big issue anyway - people can still afford to spend, businesses aren't pressured into stopping pay rises, markets won't move away from the UK to a more valued currency (as the currency remains stable and valuable).",null,0,null,1437524117,null,0,false,0,ctbjg63,null,t3_3e26ze,null,t1_ctbjg63,null,t1_ctb77s3,null,null,null,1438073271,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Hi again!

After seeing Skylake clockspeeds I have decided to wait until then for a CPU/Motherboard.

So, I'm now after a Corsair RM-i series PSU (or any good quality white/black PSU), Corsair 760t (or any other nice, white case), and up to 8 sticks of Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR4 RAM.

I will be looking to pay via PayPal, or cash if you live in Sheffield.

Thanks,

I'm going to completely disagree with you here, but roll with me because this gets fun. :) 

Spoilers for Series 8 with Capaldi are marked for OP's benefit.


1. The Relics of Rassilon are known for being Matrix Interface Devices 

2. [Capaldi Spoilers](#s ""Missy has been downloading Earth's dead for years into a slice of that same Matrix"")

3. Torchwood brought people back from the dead. . .or did they simply [Capaldi spoilers](#s ""use the Gauntlet to interface with Missy's Matrix slice""), making it appear that the dead had been resurrected? 

It's entirely possible that Torchwood only discovered that one function of the Gauntlet and jumped to conclusions.

In the 92nd minute of a drawn game between us and the scum, and you've got a choice between Lambert/Balo or anyone else on the squad, any rational individual would give it to the best penalty taker on the field. You claim Benteke is comparable, yet he's 8/12 (66%). I don't know if you simply didn't look up the stats, but 66% vs 93% vs 94% is not good enough. I'm not here to argue elementary statistics if you can't figure that one out.

Whilst there is a subjective element to everything, a shocking amount of management is done through objective means. Buying players, selling, starting XI, etc... I'm 100% in favour of signing Benteke, but he and any other player will agree with me, that the best taker on the pitch is the one who should take them.

At the time Bill Nicholson was still our manager.  With all due respect to Tim Sherwood's win %, Bill Nicholson was our greatest manager. You will see the quote from Bill that every Spurs supporter has memorized on the sidebar. Any number of regular posters on this sub can give you a full history lesson.

Bill Nicholson is so popular that we named all sort of things after him. [A road](http://imgur.com/RsMAc4l) (it's really just the walk up to the gates but i will stick by calling it a road since it is paved) , [a pub](http://imgur.com/CIpfSPl) and [a suite at WHL](http://imgur.com/qHmdKiA) to name a few.

The '71/'72 season was only a few years away from when Bill retired but was a season where we finished 6th in the league, reached the qtr final of the FA Cup, the Semi final of the League Cup (we won it the year before and the year after) but, of great importance.....we won the Anglo-Italian League Cup Winners Cup (this was an actual thing) over Torino, and then finished off by winning the UEFA Cup (in it's first season) over Wolverhampton.

The squad had several notable players on it who are revered by many of the supporters, players like Steve Perryman or Martin Chivers.

There are all sorts of things that are notable around the team, but really its just an interesting read.  It gets a bit dry at times but is full of interesting stories.  

It is also interesting to see the way the sport has changed since 1972, take for example wages....a top player in 1972 may make £10,000 a year.

Yeah maybe his comments could make you question his impact on women in science but it sounds like he has a pretty good track record on that. So if we can all agree he was just making a joke can't we just move passed it?

I get the argument that it he causes damage by saying that but if his past indicates nothing but support for women in science isn't he having some sort of net contribution? Especially as the damage he is causing is either completely hypothetical or practically impossible to quantify. 

Plus firing him just feeds the ""muh freedom of speech"" crowd.

Given the hysterical description of the *Lib Dems* as ""fanatically neoliberal"", and citation of a ""false narrative"" that doesn't actually exist (*nobody* is saying that public spending prompted the recession - the argument is that public spending levels in 2010 were unsustainable. Whether continued austerity is a good idea is entirely another matter - but you're pulling this line entirely out of nothing), I suspect you'll enjoy patting yourself on the back as the next Michael Foot leads us into another decade of Conservative rule. 

How many unelectable leaders will it take before the Labour left finally *gets it*? How many unmitigated disasters will we have to suffer through before Labour finds a leader and platform that people will actually *vote for*? 

You've just sat through five years of utter failure, with Labour being savaged *every single day* for being ""too Left"". A major element in the country's rejection of Miliband was the perceived lack of economic competence. Electing somebody *even more* to the left after that, and with the shadow of Foot and Kinnock hanging over the affair is akin to dismissing the electorate and heading off in the other direction at full steam.

With the boundary reforms, complete loss of Scotland, collapse of huge numbers of historically Liberal seats to the Conservatives, enormous boost to third party attacks on Labour heartlands, and SNP effect locking Labour out of Scotland for the foreseeable future, Labour will be fighting 2020 at an immense structural disadvantage - easily on the order of 60 seats or more. By 2020, the economy will probably be in reasonable shape - the Conservatives will be able to say they've reached a budget surplus, their internal split over the EU will have finally been resolved, and they'll have the ""safe pair of hands"" card in their hands after a decade of continuous government.

In order to win in that landscape in 2020, [Labour will be reduced to having to win seats like Kensington](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/05/labours-path-back-power-tougher-you-think) - and plenty of others that have *never* voted Labour in their history.

If you seriously think Jeremy Corbyn is the answer to a catastrophe like this - that Jeremy Corbyn, spectre of the 1980s is the man to win Kensington from the Conservatives, you've lost your mind. 

All the sanctimonious whinging about ""Labour values"" doesn't matter a damn if the party isn't in a position to actually implement them. That requires winning- and there's *zero* evidence that Corbyn would make that a possibility.

&gt;It's also absolutely hilarious for a yellow Tory to accuse anyone else of being 'suicidal'. The Lib Dems have eight MPs, no one likes quislings and Labour would do well to learn from that.

Again, demonstrating that the very worst of the Labour party can be found in its activists.

* Not sure if you'll be able to answer this for me as I obviously don't know specifc details of you, but I suppose it won't hurt to ask. I was sexually abused as a kid. When I had my initial assessment I mentioned it then. I know I will be speaking about it some more to the psychiatrist and anyone else who asks. Will they make me report it to the police?

I mean, I really hate to say it but I get the feeling that's probably at least one of the main reasons he lost, and I honestly wonder how much his political opinions actually mattered in the end, people weren't listening regardless of what he said.

Whoever wins the leadership contest needs to be someone charismatic, that's able to change the narrative and be on the offensive side, rather then the defensive side, a side that Ed seamed to find himself in much of the time. It needs to be someone that people will take notice of and listen to because if people aren't listening to what the person's got to say then they've already failed. Basically they need their own Nicola Sturgeon if they are to have a chance of winning next time around.

There's also the SNP question, now I say this as someone who broadly supports the SNP and the concept of Scottish independence, but a lot of people don't (to say the least), and I get the feeling that a lot of people in England -85% of the UK population, *really hate* the SNP and the entire concept of what they stand for. But for any future Labour government if they are unable to regain a majority will need to do some sort of deal with them, and that's something that will likely frighten off many voters (even if I personally would be quite delighted). It's a pretty big problem for whoever wins, especially for a party which is honestly just as much of a Unionist party as the Conservatives are, and many of the party members and supporters are staunch unionists: a lot of opposition to Welsh and Scottish devolution came from Labour members themselves.

Not to mention the EVEL thing which if it goes through, could potentially cause American-style shutdowns for any future Labour government that was supported by members outside England, you would have a Tory majority in England and a Labour/left wing majority for the UK as a whole and any bill which effected the English NHS or education system (for example) would be voted down, it would be crazy, nothing would ever get done.

&gt; One way to evaluate the difficulty of one league relative to another is examine the relative performance of players who have played in both leagues. Players rarely play significant time in two leagues in the same year, but they often play in one league in one year and in another the next. As long as a player’s skill level is approximately constant over this two year period, the ratio of his performance in each league can be used to estimate the relative difficulty of the two leagues.

Its possible to take a players Assists + Goals and create a ratio. 

Example:  (I'm just using goals in this example) Diego Costa had 27 goals in 2013-2014. In his debut with Chelsea, he had 20 league goals. If we assume Spain has the better league, then his ratio would be 20/27 = .74. Now we do this for all strikers who leave Spain for England and average their ratios together. You get a rough statistic that you can use. 

In this example (not statistically significant), anytime you see a player come from Spain to England, you just multiply their goal total by .74.",null,0,null,1437535862,null,0,1437536289,0,ctbq30h,null,t3_3e4yuv,null,t1_ctbq30h,null,t3_3e4yuv,null,null,null,1438078650,null,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5,null

Regaining seats in Scotland isn't really going to do Labour all that much good because the SNP will support Labour over the Conservatives anyway.

One of the good things for a Labour led government in 2020 is that if they are dependent on SNP and Lib Dem support to form the next government then they can basically force Labour to support electoral reform, though I suspect Corbyn supports that anyway.

In the two games so far one of the CMs has been sitting high, looking to get beyond the opposition DM and operate in front of the back line; a classic playmaker role. The other two CMs are setting up as a basic look and on defense deeper in a double-pivot. Going forward on offense one of them (in both games, the right side, Yaya and Zuculini) go forward and the one that stays back shifts more centrally. I think these roles are perfect for our midfield with Silva as the #10 and Yaya as the CM that roams forward at the opportunity, leaving a Fern to focus on defense. 

- Navas continues to be not good enough to be anything more than a sub for City. Bring on De Bruyne!

- Kolarov still doesn't play enough defense. Bring on Kurzawa or Sandro!

- Silva played as a wing. I really think the key to him having 5 more world-class years for us is playing him in the center behind Aguero, with Sterling and either Nasri or KDB or someone else crashing in from the wings.

- Garcia, Nacho, and Barker all look great. All should get senior team playing time this year in the cups and a rare league game maybe.

For the latter, you'd be insane to not choose Dawson - I had a truly amazing experience there. Whitechapel is a bit (read: very) run down. To the former, I'm timetabled at RLH at the same time, so we might bump into each other! 


1) Dawson has a small gym; some free weights and machines. You can pay for Virgin Active membership for a HUGE gym across the road if you want. Also Mile End is the QMUL gym - decent size, 10 mins from RLH. 


2) Sainsbury's. 


3) Don't spend too much time in Whitechapel!

We especially hate all these stupid religions, and these bullshit cultures that we are all forced to ""accept and respect"". Well I don't respect your insane culture of beheading, or thieving, or paedophilia or whatever other shit it is. We hate being the hosts for people who are not thankful to be guests.

""but you're all immigrants from vikings and-"" SHUT THE FUCK UP. That was an INVASION. I doubt we appreciated that then anymore than we appreciate the invasion of foreigners now. So I'm actually from Sweden a thousand years back? Cool story. Now I'm English and I'll fight for England and will kill any Swedish Viking that tries to invade again.

I will say that any person who was foreign, regardless of how many generations back that was, who will always stand up for British values over any other (including whatever his was historically) is fair enough. They are as British as they come and I accept them as brothers.

Do you get what I mean by this?

Mr. Abdulaziz with his thick Pakistani accent and out-of-date stock in his corner Al-Halal don't appear to share my values, so, I do not particularly want him here.

Oh yes, chavs. Sure they're usually white and whatever... nobody wants them in England too. Hence we had Australia.

If you're an immigrant then obviously you won't care about British culture other than what the liberal elite or Dr. Who decides is trivial enough not to be a threat to foreigners. Cup of tea :) crumpets :) cricket :) an EMPIRE?! That's a definite :( Well, sorry, but actual British people do have these ""scary"" beliefs rooted in thousands of years of culture. That is why you are constantly shocked at them - if you're not truly English you will never understand them. Your passport says you're English? Yeah, right... it takes generation after generation of passing down the old traditions and creating the new ones to fully appreciate what Britain is about... or any culture, for that matter.

Shorting the stock is not the sharemarket, but options and futures market, and those markets are zero sum.

He was extraordinarily overworked in terms of minutes for the last couple of years, but says he feels fresh after this summer. Additionally, where he plays is not just up to him, but up to Pellegrini. Pellegrini can tell him and it appears so far has told him he needs to play more defense than last year. If he defies those instructions I'm sure he'll get benched. 

Supporters also ignore how much 4-2-2-2 gives other teams a free run up at the holding two on the counter-attack when talking about Yaya, and how much the tactics were a problem. Finally, they also forget when talking about Yaya how much the unusually poor form behind him at CB mattered.

Yaya is one of the best CMs in the world, even if he struggled last year. Everything he struggled with is fixable. 

I agree that as a team we need more defense, and I think that comes from the defensive line and never ever using 4-2-2-2 again.

null,false,lepusfelix,null,null,null,"&gt; The reason they have no MPs is because they can't present a policy slate any UK constituency will vote for, except in one case where the candidate was a sitting MP.

They could and did present a policy slate that 14% of the country voted for, and they placed second in a whole load of constituencies.

It would not be ""fair"" to *anyone* to give them any power, but let's face it here. The people of our country, British citizens, voted them into third place. Therefore they should be in a position worthy of third place.

I am not a kipper. In 2015 I voted Green, in 2010 I voted Lib Dem, and in 2005, I shamefully voted Labour. I will not pretend I don't think UKIP would be the single most disastrous thing the UK did if they had in fact got their rightful share of the seats in May. However, that is precisely how the country voted, and therefore should be how the country is represented.

In other news, 75% of our population did not vote Conservative. The turnout was 66.1%. 25% voted Conservative. &lt;25% voted &lt;insert other party here&gt; while 33.9% did not vote at all. I think that's a pretty clear message, saying that there's 5.7 million more UK citizens who wouldn't particularly care if we were governed by llamas than there are people who voted Conservative.

In contrast, North Korea recently had a turnout of 99.97% in an election. Whoever won that pretty much indisputably had a majority, and is therefore better represented democratically.

&gt; They're a joke party who got 14% vote share by pulling the Lib Dem trick of running hyperlocal campaigns.

That's the point of having MPs in constituencies. The only people who voted for the prime minister were the ones in his constituency.

With low inflation, it becomes harder than expected for people to pay back their debts – they have to spend a higher % of income on debt repayment leaving less income for other spending.Rising real interest rates. The fall in inflation increases real interest rates, whether we like it or not. 

&gt;Rising real interest rates make it less attractive to borrow and invest; it encourages consumers to save. If the economy is depressed, this rise in real interest rates can make monetary policy less effective in encouraging growth.

&gt;Falling prices can encourage people to delay buying expensive luxury goods – they feel they need to wait a year because prices will be lower.

&gt;Low inflation is an indication of low growth. A normal period of economic growth would typically give a moderate rate of inflation (2%). If inflation has fallen to 0%, it suggests that there is intense price pressure to encourage spending and the recovery is very fragile.

To my horror, I found out I *still qualify* for housing benefit despite earning £2 an hour over NMW and doing 12 hour shifts. Granted, my entire HB payment for June came to a whopping £2, but that's mainly because they're recovering an overpayment as well. The rate they're paying, minus the overpayment repayment of £10-something, is 50p a week, hence the £2 payment. 

Shocked the hell out of me, because I expected them to turn round and say 'yup you're earning enough, we won't pay a penny'. Meanwhile I'm kinda happy about it as well, because they haven't just automatically closed my claim. I need the claim open, whether or not they pay, because I'm on a zero-hours contract, and really don't want the whole business of closing the claim one month, reopening it again the next, etc. Much happier with a constantly-open claim that's there for me if one month I don't get the hours I need to adequately pay my rent.

The fact that they're paying me HB doesn't make me happy though. It's more a data point. I'm happy to pay my rent in full, as long as I can. In fact, I am doing just that, which means some of the natural arrears associated with weekly rent being paid backdated by HB will be gotten rid of.

The Liberal Democrats will be able to point at everything this Tory government does and say ""see what happens without us?"" - every excess of the nasty party will be an argument for the moderating influence of the Lib Dems.  Ironically the Conservatives, having been shrewd enough to destroy the Lib Dems by their political decisions in the last Parliament, are most likely to reinvigorate them (though I suspect in England only) in this one.

Labour on the other hand are completely fucked.  Scottish Labour was a complete mess even before the election, but just as the Conservatives may reinvigorate the Lib Dems in England, they're only going to strengthen the SNP in Scotland.  Add to this that Labour aren't even making any substantive attempts to get Scotland back, and they're in trouble.  Perceived externally as too right-wing for Scotland, perceived internally as too left-wing for England, surrounded politically on all sides.  They need strong leadership to get them through this, and I'm not sure any of the current contenders could possibly provide the direction needed (not even Corbyn, who while being the most politically coherent can probably already hear the sharpening of knives behind him).

Add to *this* that the Tories are attempting to finish off the labour movement and its ability to support any political causes, and that the political landscape in 2020 will be completely different to the Labour Party's normal playing field (i.e. largely a wasteland where the state once stood), and I think Labour are going to have a great difficulty getting back into power.

Conversely, patients were more likely to die on a mid-week day rather than a Saturday or Sunday.

While the study has found a pattern relating to admission day and the risk of dying, the reasons for this are unknown and **it should not be assumed that the pattern is due to staffing levels or the availability of senior staff**. There could be various reasons for the relationship. For example, it may be that people who need to see the doctor and be admitted on a weekend have more severe illness than people who would wait until the following Monday to be admitted.

**Ingredients**

* 500g stewing beef, diced
* Seasoned flour
* Two onions, chopped
* A green pepper, chopped
* 2-3 large tomatoes, coarsely chopped
* A generous dollop of tomato paste
* Freshly ground nutmeg
* **Don't forget the bloody paprika you great big numpty!**
* Butter
* Olive oil
* Flour
* 3/4 pint stock
* Seasoning

**Method**

1. Trim and dice the beef and roll it in the seasoned flour
2. Add a generous knob of butter and a glug of olive oil to a heavy casserole and put on the hob on a medium heat
3. Soften the onions and peppers for a few minutes
4. Add the beef and brown for a few minutes
5. Add nutmeg, 1 tbsp flour, tomato paste, tomatoes, seasoning, stir together and cook for a few moments
5. **And also 2 tbsp paprika you amnesiac arse**
6. Add 1/2-3/4 pt. stock, stir in, put a lid on the casserole
7. Chuck it in the oven for 1.5-2 hrs at gas mark 3
8. Have a glass of wine and a blunt
10. Just before serving add a generous blob of sour or double cream and stir in

Serve with your starch of your choice - my recipe book suggested an accompaniment of sauerkraut and caraway dumplings! - but rice, new potatoes, bulgar wheat would all work well, and of course some hot ciabatta or similar will mop up the sauce nicely.

Even when this thing was allowed it was as dodgy as doing voluntary work when claiming JSA basically instead of ""oh doing voluntary they can pay you bye"" it's ""oh you doing voluntary well you have to find a real job"" the whole point of the doing a few hours here and there while claiming ESA was to ease people into work and it it didn't work out or their illness/ disability took hold they could back out and not be royally screwed, now it's no longer the case.

null,false,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,null,"When I moved here, from Australia, three years ago, I had a bit of culture shock, and I had to learn to adapt to the things that I took for granted in Australia. 

I don't want to sound like I'm complaining, but there were a few things that I didn't expect to be different, so I will call them ""surprises"".  

* narrow range of bread options in the supermarket - Australia had a very large influx of European migrants post WWII (including my parents). So rye bread is very common in [Australian supermarkets](http://shop.coles.com.au/online/SearchDisplay?storeId=10601&amp;catalogId=10576&amp;langId=-1&amp;beginIndex=0&amp;browseView=false&amp;searchSource=Q&amp;sType=SimpleSearch&amp;resultCatEntryType=2&amp;showResultsPage=true&amp;pageView=image&amp;searchTerm=rye), and it usually available from most small shops as well.

* narrow range of Eastern European smallgoods in the supermarket. e.g. Cabanossi, [Cevapi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%86evapi), liverwurst, etc. These things are [pretty common in Australia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbHFOyZpGjs). See the previous point for the reason.

Considering the UK's proximity to Europe, I had expected more of an influence. So Australia is *more* European than the UK. I didn't expect that. I guess with the influx of Polish people that this will gradually change. I shop at Polish shops to buy what I can buy in the normal supermarket in Australia. That was a surprise.

* seafood isn't popular (for an island nation) - fish and chips are big, but prawns and squid not so much.   e.g. [Sydney fish market](https://bryanchua.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/dsc_4556.jpg).  Buying a kilogram of prawns is a pretty normal thing to do in Australia, as is [""throw another shrimp on the barbie""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_CPrCS8gs)

* the influence of Indian culture - I guess I should have expected that. I guess Indian culture/food in the UK is like European culture in Australia.  The UK has ""Goodness Gracious Me"" while Australia has [""Wogs out of work""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeV9e-RQ0pY) which is about Greeks and Italians. Australia now has a massive influence of South East Asian culture. e.g Thai and Vietnamese.  Thai restaurants are huge in Australia: http://i.imgur.com/2pTkEM5.png

* the ease of driving in the UK. Driving on the motorways is like a ballet. People are considerate, let you in when you're merging, and people seem very forgiving. Driving on tiny narrow country lanes is also good because people automatically let you go through. It's done so effortlessly. 

* house prices in the country. This really blew my mind. In Australia, the further you get from an urban centre the cheaper land gets. Complete opposite here. The cheapest houses/land are usually in the old estates, and then the houses on the edge of town have a premium price. Houses that sit on their own plot of land are £1M+.

* house sizes - I didn't expect houses to be *that* much smaller.

Let's look at radiotherapy since I know a little bit about it. 


A LINAC (the machine that gives your radiotherapy) is an extremely expensive machine, that cost remains the same wether you use it 5 days a week or 7 days a week. 


However, if you use it 7 days a week you are also paying the radiotherapy team (consultant oncologist, a couple of radiotherapists, maybe a radiographer, nurses, HCAs, porters and patient transport paramedics overtime for anti-social hours on top of the extremely high running costs of the machine and possibly the running costs of the patient transport ambulance. 

You are also reducing the working lifetime of the machine by more than the extra time used as there is now less time for maintenance (again by highly trained staff, I know a guy who is works in radiology maintenance and he needed a degree in medical physics to get the job).

And finally all these staff who are working on Saturday and Sunday aren't working on Wednesday and Thursday effectively keeping it a 5 day service but at greater cost or spreading the increased work load over the same amount of staff meaning patient care and outcomes will suffer.

A truly 7 day service needs the recruitment of a lot more staff and the government has just cut medical school places by 2% and there's already a massive shortage of radiotherapists to the point where they get a non-means tested tuition fee grant to encourage them to train.

1.  You need to find out exactly how much the debts are costing you.  Ring up the institutions and ask.  They will be quite happy to tell you.

2.  How long is that £2k interest free for?  It buys you some breathing room - but you *need* to know for how long.  Again, ring up and find out.

3.  Negotiate with your creditors.  Tell them that you're struggling to repay the debt.  Ask if they can reduce the APR or increase the interest free period.  They may say ""no"" - but if you don't ask, you don't get.

4. Look at personal loans.  If you can find a load which is *cheaper* than 18.9% then, yes, it may be worth taking out.  Consolidating your debts can make the repayments look bigger (somehow £500 always looks bigger than £150 and £350!) - but if it is costing you less, it can be worth it.

5. Finally - take a deep breath.  This is probably going to be fine.  You're not under a crippling load of debt.  Draw up a budget, stick to it, ask your boss for a pay rise, and barrel through this.

This kicked off because the a leaseholder had rented out the flat above the freeholders to tenets who turned out to be noisy and inconsiderate/uncooperative. That's part of the reason I was wondering about penalties of breaking clauses in the lease - arseholes are arseholes, telling them that the lease says they can't be probably won't make any difference.

The other leaseholders are largely against amending the lease. There are some things that they seem that they'd be okay with but there does seem to be a consensus that most of the amendments are unwanted. But the point about being uncooperative is interesting. I think they're in the clear as they are having meeting with the freeholders to find some middle ground but I don't think it's going too well.

1. For a lot of voters in the Yes to AV campaign, it was never about electoral reform: it was an opportunity to spite the Liberal Democrats for entering coalition by voting 'no'. This won't be the case in the Yes to Europe campaign.

2. There is cross-party support to stay in Europe, most especially from Labour and the SNP, both of which are larger parties than the Lib Dems in terms of seats and [Scottish] votes. In the Yes to AV campaign, Labour took no definitive stance and the other 'Yes' parties didn't have as much popularity as they have now. Immediately, the Yes to Europe campaign begins with more supporters from major parties.

3. The European question, unlike the AV question, is actually something that many voters seem to be quite engaged in (as last year's landslide victories for UKIP proved), so this referendum is bound to generate interest and have a much higher turnout than the 42.2% figure that the AV referendum had. This means that more people will speak out in favour of Europe, and more people will be listening to them.

4. Opinion polls show that there is strong interest to remain in Europe, and has been for some time. The interest for AV was always dwindling.

In short, I think Coetzee's appointment won't change much: the dice are loaded in the EU's favour.",null,0,null,1437556519,null,0,false,0,ctbxepw,null,t3_3e3obc,null,t1_ctbxepw,null,t3_3e3obc,null,null,null,1438084783,null,2,false,LibDem,t5_2qwov,2,null

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"&gt;This talk of Liberal Arts degrees being pointless and not being good enough to warrant people to study them is utter rubbish.

I've never said any such thing. I've said we have a market saturation of people graduating with these degrees. I think its important people learn these things, but I don't think it's sensible to have quite so many. Just to qualify my comments above, the employment statistic available from my uni (a well-respected ""top"" university) tells me that a BA in history of art will give you an average starting salary of £16k, an MA gives you £17.5k (see [here](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/scs/career/gradstats/public_gems/). The average salary in the UK is [£26k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom). If these students aren't able to make significant contributions to the country through taxation and don't really enrich our country culturally, then their education was a poor investment by the government. Individuals may do well and that's great, but the averages are low and that's what counts. 

&gt;People who are driven and actually want to succeed who do these degrees don't find it anymore difficult to find a decently paying job than anyone else.

So are you telling me that on average the typical liberal arts grad is less driven to succeed than the typical Chemistry grad? Because I don't buy that at all. The liberal arts student is weighed down from the get go because they have skills that don't set them apart and make them valuable.

&gt;The difference between these types of degrees as opposed to the vocational degree qualifications (STEM, comp sci, medicine etc) is that if you understand the transferable skills learned you won't find it any harder to find a white collar job than anyone else.

But STEM degrees (with the exception of engineering) aren't vocational. The reason their grads get paid more is because their transferable skill set is more varied and useful. Liberal arts degrees generally teach you how to plan and structure an essay and compare themes in things, which isn't a useful skill in the workplace. Somebody who studied physics knows how to do quantitative analysis, can apply mathematical knowledge to new situations (e.g. try to construct and solve financial models for business), will usually have some programming experience, will have undertaken group work, has spent 3-4 years doing problem-solving exercises, also knows how to write a document (lab reports, literature reviews, theses etc.) and is probably better-prepared to cope with a higher workload. You will absolutely find it harder with a liberal arts degree because you're at a disadvantage; the skills you learn will never prepare you as well as those from a STEM subject. 

And anecdotally, I know one of the top English graduates from a redbrick uni who spent over 6 months applying for work and eventually took something that pays around £20k per year doing office work for a PR firm. Other English grads I know are either still looking one year on or in lower-paid work. Most of my friends graduating in physics had jobs lined up before graduation and were primarily going into things like business consultancy, banking and finance, a few going into engineering, some going into IT, the civil service... they had a much easier time selling themselves, their options are more varied and their pay is higher. 

&gt;Even the idea that many people choose these degrees in order to just experience uni is a bit wrong, albeit just from my anecdotal experience from graduating this year, I haven't met a single student that doesn't plan to use their degree to their advantage after uni.

This is probably a problem in itself. A lot of people want to graduate from uni and become journalists, screen writers, stage producers... we have no shortage of these people. I know some very talented and very driven people chasing these kinds of dreams and not really getting anywhere. I think whatever degree you have done, there are some things that are almost impossible to break into. Fair play to them for trying, but too many people graduate with these kind of expectations for them all to get in.

It used to be that going to university bought your ticket to high-paying work for the rest of your life. It showed that you were intelligent, worked hard and it set you apart from the crowd.

""It began just after four o’clock on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. Four young boys, all cousins from the same family, were playing football on a Gaza beach.

The shelling rained down – killing all four children.

The Israeli military offensive ‘Operation Protective Edge’ launched on 8 July 2014, killing and injuring scores of civilians.

This deadly seven-week battle wreaked further havoc, punishment and devastation on Gaza's already blockaded population, with Gaza’s children caught in the crossfire.

The human toll of the violence
Operation Protective Edge saw more than 2,000 Palestinian deaths (including more than 500 children) and more than 10,000 people injured.

Thousands fled their homes, or what was left of them. Those that stayed still struggle to access basic services as Gaza's infrastructure is left in tatters.

During the attacks, British deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, spoke out against Israel’s retaliatory shelling, dubbing it ‘deliberately disproportionate’ and amounting to ‘collective punishment’.

War crimes
During the conflict, family homes were among the targets for airstrikes. Our research shows there was a failure to take necessary precautions to avoid excessive harm to civilians, which is against international humanitarian law.

Several of the attacks directly and deliberately targeted civilians and landmark buildings. In many of the cases we investigated, no prior warning was given to residents to allow them to escape.

Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups also fired thousands of indiscriminate rockets and mortars into civilian areas of Israel, killing six people including one child.

Both sides in this conflict have committed serious human rights violations.""

Life isn't like a movie. Being shot in the head isn't an instant kill. Headshot victims frequently survive for a period of time after being shot. Some people actually live to tell the tale. Our perception of things such as this is tainted by the fact that we've never seen these things first hand, and our only real exposure to them is through Hollywood. 

The idea of shooting people multiple times in the head is that you completely pulverize the brain and the brain stem, ensuring the target is completely dead and therefore unable to activate a switch to detonate a bomb.

Shooting him 7 times in the head wasn't the problem. This is standard procedure. The officers who shot him were doing what they were trained to do. Their honestly held belief was that if they didn't kill this guy as soon as possible, he could have destroyed that train.

The problem was that they got the wrong the guy, and then lied about it afterwards.

I understand the concerns about freedom of speech, but there were also a lot of really good things in Cameron's talk.  Points which reddit has virtually no interest in.  And it seems to me that most people here are more interested in knocking Cameron, come what may.

And I understand why the left is concerned about anti-Muslim bigotry.  But, that's not the only problem.  At some point the left has to come up with a meaningful response to Islamofascism, and in this I think they've failed.

It does really depend on the size of the practice though- some GP practices are large enough to have extra doctors who do a lunch session, others where there are only 1-2 GPs in the surgery may not offer that. There is a lot of variation and if you're not happy-vote with your feet- that's how the funding works.

Bit off the point but I don't think we can say we live in a society where we believe 'merit not background should determine success' when we have a monarchy and a PM who went to Eton. 

I'm sure somewhere Lenin's looking up at Blair and having a good old chuckle about him calling radical leftism reactionary. It's used by both the centre and the far left to describe each other, ultimately they're both wrong, people are reactionary, ideologies aren't 

I think Blair does far lefties within Labour a great disrespect, him saying he wouldn't want to win on an old fashioned leftist platform is basically saying there is no place for them in the Labour party anymore.

Seems like a far cry from him holding weekly meeting with Dennis Skinner in his first term. 

Blair whipping out the change card, it really is marching on again. Blair sees himself as *the* moderniser, everyone who disagrees with him is just living in the past.

His one-liners line seems to me a jab, rightly, at Andy Burnham. But lets not forget Blair was the king of this, in and out of campaigns. 

Blair would know all too much about developing the wrong kind of dialogue with business.

We won elections when we had an agenda that was driven by spin and broken promises. Blair was a small c-conservative, the left had nothing to do with it.

We won because we learned how to play politics, we just forgot how to stop playing them and start governing once we got in.

Honestly this entire speech was vague fluff from start to finish. Blair talked about talking about things, but how about mentioning shit which hasn't been mentioned by any of the leadership candidates so far, like mental health? It affects 1 in 4 people and barely gets a mention by anyone other than the lib dems. 

If you want to appeal to people, star talking about stuff that actually affects them rather than why moving Labour left would be bad. I know that seems a bit irrelevant but speeches like this do nothing but make the leadership about the party not the people.

Just look at the choice of images used to portray Miliband over the last year or two. The choice of 'imperfect' ones that would normally be discarded, and *that* bacon butty photo.

Many countries do not recognise Palestine as a state. I suppose, by your logic, that all of the 58 member states who do not recognise Palestine are also advocates of killing children?

- Slippers. Because trying to walk around a ward in surgical socks isn't funny.

- Something to drink. You'll get given plenty of water by the nurses/HAs, but a bottle of squash or something to add to it will make your stay a happier one.

- Snacks. The food at Addenbrookes isn't bad by hospital standards, but you might want something to keep you going between meals.

- Entertainment. Don't rely on the ward TV, it's very expensive. Books, tablets, smartphones... whatever keeps you amused. Wards are boring places. You can bring pretty much whatever devices you like, but remember that the hospital can't guarantee their security (though I never had any concerns over this on my ward).

- Earplugs &amp; eyemask. I found it tough to get to sleep at night (wards can be noisy), and these really helped.

It works both ways. If the police do start using arms more, so will the criminals. However down to the infrequency of arms use, are all the teams actually current with their firearms training?

&gt;The problem was the intelligence the officers on the ground received from the officers monitoring him, and the subsequent orders they received from their commanders, which were basically that he was an extremely high risk, and was not to be allowed onto any train. They were told that de Menezes was an accomplice to the men who had tried to set off bombs on the tube the day before. 

In the end it is the decision of the policeman. They are not soldiers having to blindly follow instructions and it should have been clear that with a light denim jacket, the guy was not carrying a bomb. That should have been blindingly obvious to the guys restraining him.

Oh right your anecdotal evidence of why people didn't vote Labour is now conclusive fact? On that basis do you know how many people told me they wouldn't vote Labour because they'd moved to the left?

The SNP surge is not a left wing phenomenon. They are in power actually quite a centrist movement. Their surge is far more to do with Nationalism.

But whatever get Corbyn in. See what happens next. And for any of you that have any UK stocks exposure I would get it out of the UK if Corbyn wins.

Doesn't matter what round you use. If you are confronting a suicide bomber, you don't fire one shot and then wait to see if he's dead. If he still moves, fire another and so on. The idea is to kill him as quickly as possible. The easiest way to do this is to shoot multiple times until there's pretty much nothing left of his brain. Remember, the aim was to ensure that he was completely, utterly dead, and that signals were unable to travel from his brain to his hands.

&gt; Source?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Kratos

Specifically the part that says; ""aiming multiple shots at the brain stem to minimise the risk of detonation of a bomb""

&gt; If we are talking a real bomber, he may have a deadman's switch. Luckily he wasn't otherwise the officers would have killed themselves.

He may have, you're right. But when you're on a crowded metro train full of people you don't have a great deal of options to work with. Had he been a real bomber, they would have hardly had time to casually arrest him and pat him down for explosives.

Look, I think you're completely missing the point. What the Police did that day was wrong, I'm absolutely not disputing that. They killed an innocent man, and there were multiple failings from top to bottom in the Police hierarchy that day. Focusing on the number of shots they fired doesn't really achieve anything, because anyone who is actually knowledgeable about such matters knows that firing 7 shots to kill someone isn't actually that shocking. Speak to someone in the military, killing a human being is harder than most people think.

[Look at this TV Tropes article] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic). Basically like I said above, most people in the world are never exposed to this sort of thing, so our perception of how such events actually play out are skewed.

Indeed. And should never have been allowed on a bus.  The plan was that firearms teams would be outside the block of flats they were watching to stop suspected bombers before they could enter public transport.  

That never happened, and a suspected bomber was allowed to ride two buses and enter a tube station unhindered.  

They killed the wrong man, but if he had been guilty, they would have likely failed to stop him because he would have blown up one of the buses he got on.

The fault lies with the leadership, but it doesn't excuse the officers on the ground - the observation team abandoned his post for a piss, which means Charles was never properly IDed.

&gt;There are plenty of idiocy with some Tory policies but blanketing them as cartoon villains aiming to screw over the poor is stupid.

I'm not so sure you know. Screw over the poor is maybe a little hyperbolic. It's obvious they think the welfare state that people rely on fosters a culture of state dependency. Their solution to that is to cut people off. Shrinking the state seems like a pretty huge part of their ideology. 

Which is weird to me because it's like libertarianism lite. Less state financial protections but more surveillance and all this nonsense about stopping extremist views. Just seems weirdly inconsistent. 

The richest group of people have seen their share of the wealth increase. The poorer haven't. I think the actions of the government are fostering that attitude.

SCO19 are one of the best equipped and highly trained armed police services in the world. 

&gt;In the end it is the decision of the policeman. They are not soldiers having to blindly follow instructions and it should have been clear that with a light denim jacket, the guy was not carrying a bomb. That should have been blindingly obvious to the guys restraining him.

It is the decision of the police officers, and as I have said, they are some of the best in the world at what they do. They are constantly training for terrorist attacks and bomb threats. Their actions were reasonable with regards to the situation they found themselves in.

They also say he was still moving towards the armed officers when he was shot, so clearly he wasn't restrained very well. From their perspective all it takes is for him to press a button and everyone dies, in that circumstance the only thing they could do is shoot.

If the public gets told that centre right is the new left and hard right is the new right then the middle gradually moves until what was once a mainstream right wing position becomes the new political centre. 

Winning elections is important, but so is contesting the battle of ideas that decide where the political centre ground will be. If the tories are extremely likely to win the next election, assuming an average leader on both sides (and I think they are likely to do so thanks to the combo of boundary fixing, SNP dominance and proliferating third parties in England under FPTP) then perhaps it is better for Labour to try and move the centre ground for a while rather than chasing it ever rightwards. Perhaps that is actually the principled position that saves more suffering in the medium term?

It's not as simple as a binary choice between wallowing in a comfort zone or making 'hard choices' to move to the right and waiting for the inevitable election victory. Blair didn't win elections purely on moving to (what was) the political centre in his day, he also crafted a strong message of hope and bound it up in his personal charisma and rhetorical skill. If you just move to the centre and forget about the message of hope and chose a candidate without the political charisma then you'll just get the traditional result when a party of the left tries to chase a party of the right; the electorate chooses the real thing rather than the imitation.

Shooting multiple times to the head is actually a tactic used all over the world when dealing with suicide bombers, as it is most likely to instantaneously immobilize someone, as opposed to shooting to the chest, which also has the risk of hitting the bomb, setting it off.

This is true. A lot of the welfare cuts that they are making do not make any sense, although there are a few I agree with, namely benefit cap reduction.

&gt;I'm not so sure you know. Screw over the poor is maybe a little hyperbolic. It's obvious they think the welfare state that people rely on fosters a culture of state dependency. Their solution to that is to cut people off. Shrinking the state seems like a pretty huge part of their ideology.

I agree with you. This is the constructive criticism I wish people took rather than simply say its an attack on the poor. It isn't. Its an ideology with they believe will help the country. 

&gt;Which is weird to me because it's like libertarianism lite. Less state financial protections but more surveillance and all this nonsense about stopping radio views. Just seems weirdly inconsistent.

An unfortunate state of our two main parties these days. Both Conservative and New Labour exhibit these qualities.

&gt;The richest group of people have seen their share of the wealth increase. The poorer haven't. I think the actions of the government are fostering that attitude.

Capitalism rather than anything our governments can really contend with. Income inequality is certainly a growing social issue, but I do not subscribe to Rawlsian theory. There's a reason income inequality issues only rear their heads in public during periods of recession and low economic growth.

&gt;I guess what bothers me is let's say we all agree we need some austerity. Let's pretend it's a fact just like most of the country has. Taking those savings from the poorest just seems ridiculous. They're on a tight enough budget as it is. For them it might be the difference between food and no food.

He swallowed up the increasing bureaucracy from successive government reforms. He dropped seeing patients on a Wednesday to do Appraisals and QOF visits on other GPs and Practices, the paper work for these took up more of his time (including weekends).

Me and my brothers  barely saw him, or spent time with him when we were children because of the hours he worked. Yeah we always had stuff because he was paid more than enough to support us, and my mum gave up work until I went to Secondary School so we had a full time carer, but honestly the hours he had to work we unsociable (as he now realizes)

Over several years he's decided the stress is too much. He's 55 years old and preparing for retirement. A few years ago he dropped weekends. Last year he dropped QOFs and Appraisals. He's dropped down to 3 days a week and plans to retire completely by 57. 

He's not retiring because he can't be bothered and it's not his problem.

But they are always well thought through posts, making reasonable arguments around whats being discussed. However much of the comments just resort to name calling, swearing or just out of hand dismissal, very much like you have done in this comment actually. 

I can remember quite a few really good 'right wing' posts an comments just from this month specifically that i could go find if you want me to? 

I can't comment on anyone getting band, i don't 'know' anyone reddit and to be honest dont pay that much attention to all that petty stuff, it all seems ridiculous.  

You are right in saying there is Anti-tory sentiment here however! But equally i dont think you will find many of the name calling, swearing or just insulting comments being upvoted. its mainly failry cogent responses that detail why the poster feels the way they do. 

Frankly if you can't formulate a response to those kind of comments to justify your own position in a thoughtful way then thats your problem and i suggest you go away and consider why you cant come up with good arguments to back up your position. 

In real life many, many people care what Paddy Ashdown says. He is an incredibly respected politician, peace envoy and diplomat across all parties and many countries. His role in the peace negotiations in Bosnia and on going contributions to politics have earned him the right to comment and be listened to on most things he cares to turn his attention to. He is still incredibly relevant in British Politics and a big power in the House Lords. Many people on all sides of the political spectrum as a result will take this seriously. I've already seen rumblings within Tory HQ to decide how they should respond to it if its brought up in interviews. So they are clearly taking it seriously even if you aren't.  If you cant see that then i think you are the one is kidding yourself unfortunately. I might add that clearly the papers think his opinion has some value as many have picked up on the comments and done little articles on it. 

Yes he is in opposition to the Tory's but that doesn't mean everything he says is immediately to be discounted. Just like not everything Farage says should be discounted immediately simply because he is in the opposition or part of UKIP. People should be listened to and what they say taken on board and considered for its worth not just dismissed out of hand because of who they are. 

I might also note that you havent actually rebutted anything Ashdown actually said, you've just attacked him as a person, his relevance or the political leaning of this sub to justify why you shouldnt consider this.

Many of them, even if they do want to help, are just completely unable to because they don't know what to do- some are forming federations and bidding for contracts like OOH and stuff normally carried out in hosptial, some are pretending this is all going to go away, some of them are hoping that the vertical integration with secondary care happens.

The person who they believed was a suicide bomber was heading for a train, the belief based on all the information at the time was that he was imminently going to detonate the bomb and kill everyone in that train. That is when their leadership made the decision to authorise their firearms officers to treat this person as a suicide bomber about to detonate a bomb.

The armed police are trained that in that type of situation no warnings are given and the bomber is shot in the head. From their perspective he was about to blow up the carriage, he was on the train and was seconds away from detonating the bomb in his back pack so he was killed right there and then to prevent the bomb being set off.

The information they had was clearly bollocks, having said that though I can see exactly why it happened and I don't disagree with the actions of the officers on the ground, the decision made to authorise OP KRATOS or the outcome of the enquiry that cleared the police at the scene of any wrong doing.

It was a tragedy and one that came from human error and misjudgement. Anyone who lied and tried to cover up the errors should have been let go but errors happen and people need to be judged on their decision making rather than the outcome of the decisions. Police officers will make mistakes and people will die as a result. That can range from missing people killing themselves to hitting a pram while on a blue light run.

Thats 2/3rds a Solid Labour vote for its *Safe* seats. But Labour's Safe Seats are disappearing. 56 of them went to the SNP. 

Blairism (i.e. Economic neo-liberialism benefiting the rich) only worked electorally with neo-liberial ideas like mass immigration, which negatively affected the working classes, because Labour joked these 'voters had no place else to go'. 

It took its working class voters for granted and openly operated policies which worked against the interests of this core vote (in terms of immigration, housing, jobs needs) and was instead was about chasing the swing vote on green issues etc..  

There was a certainly a climate change act, a new department, costing many billions each year, but no house building - other than stunt announcements for Eco-villages (still with a mind to the swing vote).     

The SNP is a sign of Blair/Browns facade of Labour collapsing. 

Look at the cool clear numbers. Blairism at work....part of the core vote left. 
Labour's vote over time....

Labour lost about 4m voters in absolute terms (approx 15% of the electorate) - even though the total electorate grew from 43.8m to 46.4m between Labours high of 1997's 13.5m votes (34.4% of turnout) and 2015's 9.4m votes (29% of the turnout). These missing voters sat on their hands. These missing voters are well known from studies to be largely 'working class votes', the ones who had Labour routinely ignore their concerns or even dismiss them and their concerns as bigots and racists, as they supposedly had no place else to go.

During the 2015 Campaign Milliband's Labour did not try and get these key voters back on key issues like immigration or the EU, but thought it could win by continuing to play the same old game of ignoring these voters and playing upto the public sector vote while chasing other voters who had environmental concerns or this and that issue. 

(The reason for this is a key split in Labour in interests; The pro-mass immigration Public Sector unions, who provide 90% of the parties funds, want heavy competition for the working classes, via mass immigraiton, and benefit from greater population and tax base. The private sector worker obviously loses out as training goes, entry levels jobs go, insecurity is increased and resources like housing become scarce.  As a sign of this, the *average* vote for UKIP in *winning* 2015 Labour seats was a significant 20.5% as some look to other than Labour to represent them)  

Milliband relied on the pro-mass immigration core constituency of the public sector, plus welfare claimants. 

It was thought a winning margin could then be made up by chasing ex-Lib Dem voters on green policies and a pro-EU stance after the Lib Dems collapsed (students, middle class workers) to make up the 35% of GE turnover needed to win. (This was know as 'Milliband's 35% strategy').  

The Labour party has in fact repeatedly demonstrated it cannot win by Blairism/Brownism or any other strategy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
than ignores the concerns of private sector low paid voters.

So the retrenchment of Labour to the left wing and away from Blairism was inevitable as soon as the membership were allowed to vote for the leadership. I expect Corbyn to win. 
 

It is Blairism/Brownism that has repeatedly failed by ignoring the concerns of the working classes for decent housing, controlled immigration, decent wages and training, and supporting unjust demonization of welfare dependents like workers who rely on tax credits to make ends meet.

&gt; So we should use defeat as an opportunity. We have to rebuild. But approached in the right way this is exciting not depressing. How?

&gt; 1 - We get thinking – about policy, real policy not one liners which make a point (useful though those can be in a campaign). Technology and its implications for everything from the NHS through to Government itself, is the single most important dimension. But across the board, from infrastructure to housing to tax reform to welfare, we should be thinking through new solutions framed against how people live and work now.

&gt; 2 - We need to regain economic credibility. There is a perfectly sound case for saying we should have tightened policy before the crash; there is absolutely no case whatever for effectively accepting that Labour ‘caused’ it. But we cannot address the future unless we are clear about the past and unless we show we’re completely confident in economic policy.

&gt; 3 - Some forward-thinking Labour Local Councils have done great work. Celebrate them and learn from them.

&gt; 4 - Develop a dialogue with business about their challenges and needs; about productivity, skills and a modern industrial policy.

&gt; I agree with you. This is the constructive criticism I wish people took rather than simply say its an attack on the poor. It isn't. Its an ideology with they believe will help the country.

Well my contention is that their ideology - when compared to the alternative - is rather focused on attacking the poor out of poverty rather than helping them. It's a sort of ""tough love"" approach. Individualism over helping the society. Which is weird to me. It's like hiring a plumber who believes that your pipes are your own responsibility. 

&gt;Capitalism rather than anything our governments can really contend with. Income inequality is certainly a growing social issue, but I do not subscribe to Rawlsian theory. There's a reason income inequality issues only rear their heads in public during periods of recession and low economic growth.

Not sure why Capitalism is something out governments can't contend with. That makes it sound like some superliminal being that's guiding us. It's an economic system which could use some tweaks if you ask me. 

I find the arguments about inequality always a little silly. You have someone always arguing that inequality is a good thing. Drives people to do stuff. Like the other side is seriously considering eliminating inequality entirely - like that's even ever been mentioned as a possibility. As far as I've read high levels of inequality are bad for economies. But you know even if they weren't I'd be against them. 

Poverty may be relative. The poorest in Britain may have more than they ever had - rising tide raises all boats and all that - but it's still a pretty hopeless existence. Rich people even almost literally (hyperbole) aren't held accountable by the same laws. We see the powerful protected. You read a story of fraud, laundering and tax evasion costing the country billions but when I need two weeks to try and send some CVs and get a job I'm sort of just told to fuck off I should have saved.

I guess confusion is the best way to describe my feelings towards the Conservative party. You can find plenty of quotes with them agreeing that social mobility is an issue. Even from the PM himself. I just can't see how the measures they are taking will help alleviate the problem. Funnily enough however the measures do appear to be helping rich people.

Take two examples from the front page of the private eye. 2% cut in corporation tax gives away £2.5bn annually (mostly to the largest companies) - which is a bit more than they removed from child and family elements of tax credits. It goes on to criticise it as tax haven behaviour.

Or how about the inheritance tax which seems to actually leave out Lord Rothermere for the moment.

Now to give them as much credit as possible I'm going to try and infer what the Conservatives are trying to do. Giving extra money to companies while removing help for mothers and families will push them into work. Work which companies can afford to pay for because of the tax cuts. I just don't understand how they don't realise that won't be immediate. And that isn't even an in depth criticism. Surely the economy is slow to react to these things but a single mother isn't. Don't worry about her hungry child because in a few years there might be job opening somewhere.

Sorry about the long post. I was just trying to explain why some people feel the cartoon villain caricature isn't too far off. Even with the benefit of the doubt that they aren't wilfully hurting or targeting the poor, I'd say there was a pretty decent argument to be made that their ideology disproportionally affects the weakest and most vulnerable. The opinion is in good company. The Social Security Advisory Committee and the Equality and Human Rights Commission are both calling for an impact assessment on austerity measures - which is being ignored. They believe their policy is hitting the most vulnerable hardest. For full disclosure they were mostly talking about families with disabled people in.

* The big criticism of Labour during the Election campaign, and during the Scottish Referendum is that they read the mood of their core voters wrong and alienated the Scots.

* The Labour leader election rules have changed, meaning that no longer do we have the Unions as a weighted electoral college, shoeing in whatever leader suits them best. Instead we have ""one person one vote"" and as a result, we can clearly see that grassroots Labour members hugely support the leadership of a leftist, principled, outspoken maverick.

* Everyone commenting (not just here, but everywhere) seems to believe that when you say ""Labour Party"", what you're referring to is the dozen or so people who sit on one particular bench in a crumbling palace.

Now, here's what I'm seeing, and what I'm not getting...

The eligible voters want Corbyn. Eligible voters are registered Labour supporters - the exact same people who felt the core team weren't listening to them with Miliband in charge.

Noises have been made by everyone, including Harman, that they need to start listening to their grassroots supporters and connecting with the public at large.

So when the voice of the public, the voice of the eligible Labour supporters is heard in a poll of who they'd like to be the next leader, suddenly everyone who's anyone pops out of the woodwork and says, with one mighty voice ""Oooooh no, not him! He'll never win! Nobody will work with him!""

But he's who the public want - or at least the majority of the eligible Labour Party voters want. In interviews and hustings, he's come across as intelligent, passionate, principled. With no figures to back me up, I can imagine he's *just* what the country needs to see in an Opposition leader - someone who will actually *OPPOSE*.

Haven't we the public proved that a Cenrist, ineffective, passionless Labour Party is unelectable? Didn't we the voting public tell Labour in no uncertain terms that we don't want what they're offering? Isn't it time to sweep out failing New Labour and go back to being what they're supposed to be - isn't that what the grassroots Labour Party have done by persuading Corbyn to run for leader, then hugely supporting him in this poll?

At the moment the low inflation is largely down to things like the drop in the oil price feeding through into the cost of good and services, which is making things cheaper to buy.  In general this probably isn't a particularly bad thing as far as the economy is concerned.

If, however, low inflation or deflation was being caused by a crash in asset values (say the housing market, or stock, or something) then things can be very bad.  For instance, the UK hit a period of deflation after the 2009 financial crisis, when things were obviously in the shitter.  We've got low inflation now, and things aren't anywhere near as messed up.

&gt;I can remember quite a few really good 'right wing' posts an comments just from this month specifically that i could go find if you want me to? 

Please!


&gt;I can't comment on anyone getting band, i don't 'know' anyone reddit and to be honest dont pay that much attention to all that petty stuff, it all seems ridiculous.  

Not really petty when people were getting banned for right views a few months ago on this sub, maybe it's just the subs I browse that I hear so much about it.


&gt;You are right in saying there is Anti-tory sentiment here however! But equally i dont think you will find many of the name calling, swearing or just insulting comments being upvoted. its mainly failry cogent responses that detail why the poster feels the way they do. 

No! Wrong! Go to any top post and most of the top comments are either fear mongering or an anti-Tory circle jerk. The posts themselves may be well written, but there's always an agenda.




&gt;Frankly if you can't formulate a response to those kind of comments to justify your own position in a thoughtful way then thats your problem and i suggest you go away and consider why you cant come up with good arguments to back up your position. 

Who considers it a good argument? You? Obviously your going to think they aren't good. 


&gt;In real life many, many people care what Paddy Ashdown says. He is an incredibly respected politician, peace envoy and diplomat across all parties and many countries. His role in the peace negotiations in Bosnia and on going contributions to politics have earned him the right to comment and be listened to on most things he cares to turn his attention to. 

Any politician has a right to comment on politics. You don't need a CV to make comments about politics, by your logic Tony Blair should be listened to and respected more than others because of his role in the Northern Ireland, Good Friday agreement.


&gt;He is still incredibly relevant in British Politics and a big power in the House Lords. Many people on all sides of the political spectrum as a result will take this seriously. I've already seen rumblings within Tory HQ to decide how they should respond to it if its brought up in interviews. So they are clearly taking it seriously even if you aren't.  If you cant see that then i think you are the one is kidding yourself unfortunately. 

Your kidding yourself by thinking he's relevant, he'll be dead in a few years (hopefully)   And after all the fake condolences and a few months has passed, he'll just be another has been hack.



&gt;I might add that clearly the papers think his opinion has some value as many have picked up on the comments and done little articles on it. 

Because the lefty papers pick up on this to scaremonger and so the righty papers pick up on the story. Amy Whinehouse's drug habit and Danielle Radcliffes cock was in the mainstream papers, so Danny's cock must have some value to British people.



&gt;Yes he is in opposition to the Tory's but that doesn't mean everything he says is immediately to be discounted. 

It kind of does. If everyone listened to the opposition then we'd all be sitting with our thumbs up our arses.


&gt;Just like not everything Farage says should be discounted immediately simply because he is in the opposition or part of UKIP. People should be listened to and what they say taken on board and considered for its worth not just dismissed out of hand because of who they are. 

You're assuming I dislike his character, not his politics. I don't like his politics, hence why I don't listen to his biased opinions on the opposing parties. 

I bet you're one of those people who got deeply upset at people mentioning Eddies character. Character has a lot to with politics, if you're perceived to be weak and you are, you have no business running a somewhat powerful nation.




&gt;I might also note that you havent actually rebutted anything Ashdown actually said, you've just attacked him as a person, his relevance or the political leaning of this sub to justify why you shouldnt consider this. 

Political leaning of the sub to explain why it's almost pointless arguing here.

His relevance, directly related to my first comment.

It is clear that this is not enough money.  They are also slashing social services through their austerity programme, critical services allowing people to get out of hospital once doctors are finished with them.

The HSCA (previous government) is what allowed increasing private involvement in the NHS.  We now have things like cataract operations being done by private companies, meaning that they are not part of the pool of cases offered to doctors in training (just using that as one example).  I await the results of the ""devo Manc"" experiment to see what the first big chunk of their NHS services is to go to a big company.  I recently saw a leaked email from a Manchester NHS trust saying that outside management consultants from the US were being brought in - this is the first step.

Personally, I think Hunt is a stooge.  Anyone who follows the news will already have no respect for him because of the way he handled the BSkyB thing last term.  Cameron/Osborne are the ideologues who want to dismantle as much of our public services as they can, conning the electorate into it being necessary to ""balance the books"" when in fact the NHS needs much more money to cope with the ageing population, increasing cost of treatment, etc.  In the end it will be ironic that those who use the NHS most (old people with chronic conditions) will be the ones who suffer most from its eventual downfall, and that they are the ones who vote Tory in the greatest numbers.  I am passionate about the NHS and its continued existence, because socialised healthcare is a wonderful thing with immense value in our society.   Even if a USA-style system might well triple my salary.

I actually agree Labour need to fight from the centre but alone this is insufficient. The entire left needs a rethink and to accept the reality of the political land scape.

Personally I feel Labour need to actually leave Scotland altogether and allow an associated, but independent, pro union Scottish social democratic party to take their place. They need somebody to push out the SNP and this is the only way that will be achieved given the current level of distrust of Westminster focused politics.

They may need to do similarly in Wales but it hasn't got that far yet. In all likelihood once Scotland splits a demand for similar will come from Wales.

For example an end goal could be lower train ticket prices.  None of the candidates are advocating this.  One of them is advocating renationalising the railways.  Renationalising the railways is something a small group of people will get behind.  Lower ticket prices (however you choose to do it) is something that a large group of people will get behind.

I simply refuse to allow the current political circumstances move the goalposts of what is considered the political centre. Much of the west has been drifting to the right - how are we supposed to quantify political evolution if we abandon the notion of fixed political designation?

What does it even mean to say left or right wing politics when you allow the ""centre"" to be a constantly moving position? It just doesn't make sense. I would broadly place myself on the centre left - will I be considered a fringe left wing extremist in 20 years because a minority of the electorate have empowered governments to implement right wing policies?

Overall, Labour are right of centre. If anyone thinks that they are left of centre, then that's simply because the UK has veered to the right. It's true to say that Labour are to the left of the Tories, but it is not true to say that they are left of centre.

For some reason people in the UK are increasingly eager to buy into the type of political dichotomy that pits one large ""left wing"" party against one large ""right wing"" party, and are unconcerned that this simplistic narrative does not reflect reality.

Hi all, I've had these accessories laying around awhile and my wife has been on my case to get rid of them due to the amount of room that they take up!

Logitech Harmony Touch remote control (£80) - sealed never been opened, 

Blue SnowBall Omnidirectional (£45)- used occasionally but picked up a headset with mic and haven't used the snowball since. Still have the original box. 

Logitech G13 gamepad (£35) - purchased it secondhand but the seller never indicated it came from a smoking home as such it's sat in a the box, 

Saitek X55 Rhino (£120)- purchased to play Elite Dangerous but then GTA V came out and only used it maybe 3 times. Still have the original box and extra springs

Sennheiser HD 449 (£40)- sealed and never been opened. 


Postage to be added on top of the above prices, and payment to be done via Bank Transfer, if you have any questions let me know!

Solidarity was founded through a split from the SSP. Two factions went with him: one, the SWP, has been racked with allegations that its leaders [covered up rape allegations](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/09/socialist-workers-party-rape-kangaroo-court); the other, SPS, has [since decided to leave](http://socialistpartyscotland.org.uk/2015/03/14/why-socialist-party-scotland-has-left-solidarity/). It's now Sheridan and a small band of his personal followers. They didn't even publish a manifesto for the last Scottish election, but I imagine any 2016 manifesto will be a rough mish-mash of the policies they inherited from the SSP in 2006 and some tacked-on stuff about opposition to fracking, etc.

A vote for Solidarity is basically a vote for a Sheridan ego-trip, which would wreck much of the work done by the left in the independence referendum to repair the damage he dealt to the socialist and independence movements when he split the SSP.

He has undergone some sort of public rehabilitation because he spoke at public meetings and rallies around the bedroom tax and the Yes movement—even though the Bin the Bedroom Tax campaign refused to work with him, as did Labour for Independence, Women for Independence, the SNP, etc. ([""Sheridan frozen out of Yes campaign""](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13165434.Sheridan_frozen_out_of_Yes_campaign/))

The Greens are a left-wing environmentalist and liberal party with a relatively tame manifesto, while the SSP are Scotland's largest socialist party, with thirty active branches across the country. We publish Scotland's only socialist newspaper, the *[Scottish Socialist Voice](https://scottishsocialistvoice.wordpress.com/)*, and are active in communities around the country. My branch is leading the campaign to save Menzieshill High School from closure. The SSP will probably be standing next year in alliance with the [Scottish Left Project](http://leftproject.scot/).

The [SSP submission](https://www.scottishsocialistparty.org/ssp-submission-smith-commission/) to the Smith Commission makes clear our support for fiscal autonomy: ""We support the devolution of all fiscal and tax raising powers for example to allow Holyrood to eradicate the terrible social problems, stark inequalities and appalling deprivation that blights this wealthy nation of ours.""

Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock and Ed Milliband were perceived by most as left wing and they lost Labour three elections. Tony Blair was perceived by many as right wing and won three elections. 

One of the most successful attacks on Ed Milliband/ Labour was the fear over his economic competancy.  If you are going to win a UK election you have to convince people they you have to at least draw level on the business/economy debate.  Labour has the greatest chance of winning if it positions itself to be "" as good as the conservatives on the economy but more compassionate on social issues"".

&gt;There is a dark, twisted irony to David Cameron's tub-thumping speech against the poison of extremism. The PM presents himself as standing up for British values yet he is demolishing what ought to be the most important British value of all: freedom of speech.
Cameron let rip on Isil and its apologists. In a wide-ranging speech he had a pop at everyone from internet companies that fail to protect web-surfers from violent Islamist videos to the National Union of Students, whose alliance with Cage, the jihadi-sympathising charity, he described as shameful.
He talked about the failure of integration, and how this left some sections of certain British communities out in the cold — where conspiracy theories about 9/11 can take hold and where the propaganda of Isil can seem like a “glamorous"" alternative to life in Blighty.
We must remind these people, and everyone, that Britain remains a “beacon to the world”, said Cameron. We have good values and we should big them up, he said, in the ""struggle of our generation” — the struggle against violent Islamist extremism.
&gt;Yet elsewhere in the speech, a mere few breaths after talking about Britain’s beacon status, Cameron showed just how cavalier he is about freedom of speech — surely the most important values in any society that considers itself enlightened.
He said he would give Ofcom more powers to tackle foreign TV channels that promote hateful messages. He had a go at the media for giving a platform to extremist Muslim voices, which sounded to me like pressure from the very top of the political sphere to get the media to “no platform” undesirable people.
But worst of all, he set out his government’s commitment to tackling what he called “non-violent extremism” — that is, people who don’t promote or partake in violence but who simply have ugly beliefs.
He said his government will “tackle"" all those who “may not advocate violence but [who] do promote other parts of the extremist narrative”.
This is a step too far. This moves officialdom from the realm of physical acts and violent plots, which it absolutely must police, into the realm of speech and debate, where official clampdowns can never be justified.
We don’t have to wait to see what Cameron means by “tackling” non-violent extremism. His ministers have been spelling it out for months.

&gt;At the end of last year Theresa May openly said she was sick of having to distinguish between extremists who plot violence and extremists who simply spout nonsense.
“The problem that we have had is this distinction of saying we will only go after you if you are an extremist that directly supports violence”, she said.
The government will ""eliminate extremism in all its forms”, she said, defining as an ""extremist"" anyone who lacks “respect for the rule of law” or ""respect for minorities”. This could cover, not just Islamist hotheads, but Trotskyists who don’t respect British laws or Christians who don’t support gay marriage (and therefore don’t have “respect for minorities”).
In the Queen’s Speech in May, the government introduced Extremism Disruption Orders, which can be used to shut-up anyone who says extremist things. If you're served with an EDO you can’t speak on a public platform. And you need permission from the police even to tweet. It’s terrifying.
What May and Cameron view as the pesky distinction between action and speech, between violent and non-violent extremism, is actually the foundation stone of all free, enlightened societies: we police criminal behaviour, but not thoughts, ideas, words.
“Extremism Disruption” is a fittingly Orwellian phrase, because the Conservatives have just introduced thoughtpolicing, the punishment of people not for what they do but for what they *say*.
Freedom of speech is more than just a value. It is the best tool we have for tackling the backward ideas of Isil and its creepy fanboys. We need more openness and debate, not less, in order to expose conspiracy theories and challenge the hateful.
Yes, freedom of speech allows irritants to say stupid things — but it empowers the rest of us to have it out with them. In silencing non-violent extremists, Cameron is also infantilising us non-extremists, denying us the opportunity to do our public duty and have a war of words with these reactionaries.
So, Cameron holds Britain up as a beacon to the world while extinguishing what ought to be the flame in that beacon: freedom of speech. If this really is the struggle of our generation, it just got off to a really bad start.

**(a) we're not given any sort of preparation as children by the education system for personal financial planning. Not everyone's parents are accountants, we wonder why some poor people seem to blow through limited incomes/state benefits in this country instead of being prudent, this is a large factor imho.**

**(b) The UK in general seems to have a culture where you don't discuss financial planning with friends, and certainly it's considered taboo to voice concerns to someone who seems to be living beyond their means.**

I find it difficult when people extend the culture of personal debt (pay it off as quickly as possibl) to things like mortgages and student loans, secured loans on cars etc.

For secured loans and a mortgage you have an asset that can be sold - if you were really struggling to pay the mortgage you can downsize and/or move somewhere cheaper to live. For cars and boats the same holds true, albeit with less of a personal wrench. This seems to cause trouble when I say it to anyone though.

You've got to apply common sense, am I living somewhere where being unemployed for six months would also make me homeless? If yes, then do something about it before it is too late.  Arguably having a fixed pension for every month makes it easier to budget, not harder. Unless you avoid living beyond your means and have a sensible amount to repay you should be fine. Don't take out a 25 year fucking mortgage on a five bed house in a fashionable london suburb at 50 and then complain you can't afford it at 65 when your income drops.

My point, If I'm allowed to make it, Master Waller. Is that is it such a silly idea that maybe in the same way that police have been known to be in-protest-aggressors in the past that the same people who would have been doing that are now commenting on reddit or going on downvote brigade's?

Please accept my sincerest apologies for being such an idiot and having an opinion. I hope in the future we can put this past us and have a budding friendship in the future because lord knows I won't rest until the error of my ways have been forgiven.

**Report**

I compiled a short list of sources on the discussion of police brutality and to also defend my opinion of police provocateurs being used during protests to incite riots. In order to do this, I used the websites available to me through my own expense and institutions I am apart of. For example, a big help to me when gathering these sources was JSTOR, although initially expensive I've found it was a useful tool when gathering articles needed to prove my point.

Also available to me was a website called 'Google' which allowed me to simply type in keywords and within microseconds I had pages of results on police provocateur. It really is a useful tool, I can't believe people don't use it. I also want to thank the many users of the subreddit /r/unitedkingdom for being totems of British ideals.",null,0,null,1437568671,null,0,1437654404,0,ctc0v8k,null,t3_3e65un,null,t1_ctc0v8k,null,t1_ctc0c2k,null,null,null,1438087534,null,-13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-13,null

&gt; The former prime minister said Mr Corbyn was “the Tory preference” to lead his party.

So?  That says pretty much zilch about how effective he'll be as leader, just a biased opinion on ideology coupled with some honestly quite immature behaviour from Tory supporters.  You could even argue they're at the second stage of Gandhi's famous saying: 'First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.'

&gt; “[Labour] misunderstand the difference between radical leftism, which is often in fact quite reactionary – and radical social democracy, which is all about ensuring that values are put to work in the most effective way,” he said.

Dat thought-terminating cliché.  No substance as to why radical leftism is bad, just throw a vapid negative at its supporters and move on.  New Labour must be better, because it's progress!

&gt; “Let me make my position clear: I wouldn’t want to win on an old-fashioned leftist platform. Even if I thought it was the route to victory, I wouldn’t take it.”

At least he's nailed his colours to the mast for all to see.  Blair's use of centrism was never a ruse to get power in an apparently right-wing electorate, it was always his intended ideology.


&gt; He later added: “Even if you did [win] it wouldn’t be right because it wouldn’t take the country “forward, it would take it backwards. That’s why it’s not the right thing to do.""

So making a stand against poverty, inequality, vested interests and the destruction of the environment is backwards now?  Well, this explains a lot about the Blair years...

I'm sorry, but I just can't stand Blair.  Yes, he won three elections.  Margaret Thatcher _also_ won three elections.  Yes, he did some good things in power.  Any Labour leader would have done those things, and we've seen some good ideas (gov.uk, same-sex marriage, even PIP has some winners amongst its many losers) from the Coalition.  But it's statements like this that just make me really question whether his commitment to Labour values.

If Westminster wants stability, it needs to accept PR and coalition as the future of liberal democracy.

We also have a huge number of games to be played, and I don't really see the drawback of sticking Mario and Ings together for the early round FA/League cup games. If he's shit, he goes back to the bench, no harm really done as we should be able to beat those teams regardless of how Mario performs. 

The second reason is that I think the club will get more value for him if he's sold in January. There are always clubs that get desperate during the winter window when they can see relegation becoming more and more likely. We should hang onto him, try to get some kind of production from him, and then let him go in January when a better offer will likely come in.

I washed and redressed it myself daily, and only went to the GPs to get the stiches taken out because they were too deep for me to do it myself. It would have been a complete waste of the Practice Nurse's time for me to go have it checked and redressed there.

&gt;How many unelectable leaders will it take before the Labour left finally gets it? How many unmitigated disasters will we have to suffer through before Labour finds a leader and platform that people will actually vote for?

Again, hilarious thing for someone to come out with considering the fact they are obviously an activist with a party whose MPs now number in the single digits after their turn to the right. 

Can you actually explain what was too 'left-wing' about Ed Miliband? Miliband's Labour Party accepted the narrative that it spent too much money, implicitly accepting the narrative that public spending caused the recession. It's quite difficult to put forward your own narrative after that and appear competent, which I think is the issue there rather than being too left-wing. It's interesting that you don't cite any particular policies as being too left-wing just a general perception, I suspect because there aren't actually any specific policies that you can call too left-wing without appearing to be an extreme neoliberal.

&gt;Given the hysterical description of the Lib Dems as ""fanatically neoliberal"", and citation of a ""false narrative"" that doesn't actually exist (nobody is saying that public spending prompted the recession - the argument is that public spending levels in 2010 were unsustainable

This is quite funny, the entire 2010 and 2015 elections were fought on the basis that Labour 'crashed the economy'.

You are seriously some kind of control freak, like I said yellow Tories don't get to decide the outcome of leadership contests in other parties no matter how much they throw their toys out the pram because Labour aren't electing the 'Labour' equivalent of Nick Clegg.

I simply believe that it's very hard to have a quantitative discussion about things if you cannot agree on fixed terms of reference. Also, despite what has been happening re. an obvious shift to the right in some countries, many other countries have moved to the left since a century ago. Bearing that in mind, people who move the goalposts as regards what constitutes the centre are simply engaging in a very insular form of political discussion where they ignore the broader historical and geopolitical context of past and current politics, by bending over backwards to normalise the political status quo they personally experience in a small set of political systems.

As someone who does research for a living, I personally find it useful to have fixed definitions and terms of reference in order to quantitatively analyse things. In politics it seems that people want to move the goalposts constantly so that we're in a constructed and constant ""left vs. right"" political dichotomy between two sets of political beliefs and practices which in reality are broadly overlapping.

You may see that as a useful way to analyse things, but I see it as dragging to UK to the political level of the US and I don't think it's a productive road to travel.

Mental health care is somewhat different to physical health care as openness and empathy aren't optional extras - they are absolutely necessary in order to promote long-term wellbeing. This includes listening to the patient and offering them the specific help they want, rather than trying to fit them into a particular care ""pathway"" which might not help them in the slightest.

So, essentially, in order to win Labour needs to turn into a centrist party that forgoes its purpoted left-wing ideals to capture the moderate middle-class.

What's the point then? you've won, now you are not going to do what your party was founded to do, and in fact might very well do some of the opposite of it? great job, you've saved the other guys the trouble.

This kind of reasoning is nonsensical. If you can't win because the country is genuinely not in line with your ideas then so be it: be at the opposition and work from there. Persuade people. Organize workers. Be in the offices, in the factories, in the logistical centers. Create great youth organizations.

This is how Labour (and other European left-wing parties) managed to become great. The European working class wasn't born left wing, nor was it born organized and unionized. It was politicized and mobilized by people who understood that the material reality of work relationships created a vast class of people with common interests who, if it could be convinced to band together, would become a great force.

Honestly all I want is some honesty, if they can't talk about it until the investigation is complete then fine. That is not what happend though, they shouldn't have been going round leaking information to the press that paints their actions in the preferred light and the police chief in question shouldn't have said 'the leaked documents and statements gave an accurate picture of what was known so far about the shooting' when he knew that wasn't the case.

Gandhi didn't say that. Also, congratulations on employing the most saccharine of all cliches in one paragraph and railing against cliches in the next paragraph. Has it occurred to you that being laughed at *in no way* suggests that you're eventually going to win?

&gt;No substance as to why radical leftism is bad

The substance is: It's bad *because* it's reactionary; it's reactionary *because* it wants to take things back to how they were in the past, despite the fact that those things have been widely discredited. Corbyn's whole outlook is near-identical to the Bennite outlook he's been pushing for *thirty-two years* as an MP. You cannot deal with 2015 problems with 1983 solutions, especially not when those 'solutions' were comprehensively rejected by the electorate.

&gt;At least he's nailed his colours to the mast for all to see. Blair's use of centrism was never a ruse to get power in an apparently right-wing electorate, it was always his intended ideology.

The emphasis in the sentence: 'I wouldn’t want to win on an old-fashioned leftist platform' should fall on 'old-fashioned', not 'leftist'. Indeed, Blair makes this clear in a section that *you quote yourself* when he says it would 'take the country backwards', which you somehow see as being in favour of:

&gt;poverty, inequality, vested interests and the destruction of the environment

This is a collossal failure to argue with any sense of the principle of charity -- unless, of course, we're reading different articles and Blair actually said 'I'm against eliminating poverty, inequality and vested interests, and what has the environment ever done for us?'

Two of those Blair definitely took steps to tackle (poverty, destruction of the environment); one of those he had a more qualified success (inequality went up but the effects of inequality mostly decreased); on vested interests he did a lot to root out corruption in the government (the level of corruption in the '90s was insane), but that's a job that's never completed.

&gt;Yes, he did some good things in power. Any Labour leader would have done those things

Not if they hadn't gotten elected. Also, can you really be arguing that all the good things Blair did were things any leader would've done but all the bad things were due to his unique character flaws?

&gt;It's statements like this that just make me really question whether his commitment to Labour values

Reduces poverty. Rescues NHS. Rescues schools. Gets more working class kinds into uni. Is questioned for his loyalty for suggesting that the fact that he's spent his entire political career watching radical leftists lose elections is a good reason to suspect that they lose elections.

Relative poverty is tangible, whereas the way we choose to classify political ideologies and policies is a vehicle for discussion that has little impact on the reality of a given political situation (particularly when the terminology is redefined in response to political situations).

You might as well claim that treating anything else aside from politics as relative would undermine my personal view on how we should hold political discourse. You can do that, but I don't think it's a sensible argument. There's nothing wrong with talking about political ideologies relative to one another - as I said above, it's correct to say that Labour are to the left of the Tories - but my argument is that this relative discussion would be easier to have against a fixed background of terminology that everyone can agree on, which would allow a consistent analysis of political trends in a non-relative manner.

People are free to disagree with that, but I don't get what's so contentious about wanting to have fixed terms of reference to frame political analysis.

Indeed. He was struck by police, but died because he was in such a state generally anyway that it would never have have taken much - something the police can't really allow for when they're formed in a line fighting a riot, and it's obvious from the video that he was never in a Rodney King-type situation.

Lenin spent much of his career being attacked by people claiming to be on his left, so he and Blair would have something in common. Lenin even wrote a book called [*""Left-wing"" Communism: An Infantile Disorder*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Left-Wing%22_Communism%3A_An_Infantile_Disorder), which argues, among other things, that getting power is more important than intellectual purity. Sound familiar? He also says British people should vote Labour, incidentally, though not in an entirely positive way.

&gt;We won elections when we had an agenda that was driven by spin and broken promises. Blair was a small c-conservative, the left had nothing to do with it.

Less poverty, more hospitals, shorter waiting lists, better schools, more working class kids in uni. He also kept promises about taxation, which I don't expect any of Corbyn's supporters would be complaining about if he *had* broken them.

So, basically, we've got not nationalising the rail and tuition fees for 'broken promises', the latter of which was part of a package of reforms which, as I said already, got more working class kids into uni.

By the way, find me the political leader who keeps all their promises.

It doesn't matter how late their decision is, there is no statute of limitations (there does appear to be for [debt](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ihtmanual/ihtm28384.htm), but benefits aren't debt). It also doesn't matter that a financial advisor didn't tell him about it, it's still your dad's responsibility. He may be able to reclaim the money from the financial advisor through the courts, but would need to ask a lawyer. Regardless, it's a separate issue.

He will need to pay back CB for you from when you stopped full time education. Since he has other children, this will be at the lower rate (the higher CB rate will pass to the next oldest when you become non dependent). He will not be charged interest, and not be charged any fees unless he fails to pay and the debt gets sent to an external debt collection agency - at that point the agency's fees would get added onto the existing debt. If he receives any local government benefits like child tax credit or housing benefit, there will likely be more money to pay back, so he should contact them immediately.

EDIT: Rereading the post, I didn't realise that this happened a couple of years ago. If he's still receiving CB for two children then the DWP knows that they're still his dependents. It sounds like there's either more to this than you are aware of, or your dad needs to contact them immediately to figure out where the extra charges came from.

That depends. If you're lucky enough for such a match then that's great. However those with none/smaller employer contribution and/or are on the basic tax rate, it may not always be the most prudent course of action.

Management of pensions has a fee, and those fees often increase when you leave the job and/or incur more fees to actively change it. This can make a company pension uncompetitive compared to other investment products or indeed, other pensions. Hell sometimes it is actively worse than putting the money under the mattress for 45 years. Least in an ISA it's only taxed once whereas in many pension receipts get taxed on the first 75%.

Although we don't know what will actually happen or even if City will be present at the meeting this will probably be quite important to anything materialising. This is a condensed version on the consensus of the Pogba saga over at bluemoon:

- Juve will *not* sell unless Pogba says he wants to leave.

- We are seriously pursuing Pogba as our main target, but we're trying to do some quiet business here and if we're told that the player isn't interested or that we're going through have to jump through hoops or if we suspect we're being wound up just to increase Barcelona's future bid we'll simply leave negotiations. 

- No talk about potential backups if Pogba falls through, but someone on the thread mentioned Youri Tielemans and Oliver Torres and I'm quite partial to those two although Tielemans is not ready to start yet.

- Barcelona's new president Bartomeu has said they will not show interest in Pogba, at least this summer.

- Today's meeting will include Raiola and is essentially about confirming the player's intentions and willingness to move so the appropriate actions can be taken so that we can submit a bid that Juve will accept and Pogba will not turn down. 

So we really can't get excited just yet. Pulling all three of these lads in one window will take some tremendous negotiations from City and we're going to see Edin/Jovetic leave before one of Pogba/KdB come in.

It is not just lack of willingness - there is a substantial underlying issue which isn't being address and is getting worse.

The police didn't have a good photo of the suspect, so it was very hard to identify him, which is why they followed him instead of arresting immediately. They only decided he was the person they were after once he had got on the bus. 

&gt;Once they had pre-fucked up by misidentifying him, their orders were to pursue and intercept, with the rules of engagement allowing them to shoot if he was a threat.

They only managed to intercept him once he was already on the train. The intel had told them he was a terrorist and a bomb threat. One officer tried to restrain him, but he struggled to get away, moving towards the armed officer, which is when he was shot. Under the circumstances, and with the information they had, the officers on the ground acted as they should have. 

&gt;Perhaps you can't be trusted to find your arse with a map, but I've been subject to chain of command enough times in my life to know that - as this case demonstrates - mindlessly following orders is much more likely to lead to a fuck up than what you call second guessing, 

Its not a question of mindlessly following orders, its about doing the right thing with the information you have. In this case, the officers believed he was a bomb threat, he was already on a train, their only option was to immediately incapacitate him. It would be foolish and dangerous to act in any other way. The blame lies with the people who provided the intelligence, not the officers on the train.

I should take a moment to emphasise that I am in no way saying that men are to blame for this, not at all, because they are only trying to overcome a lifetime of conditioning.

And saying that men are reluctant to seek help is not a dismissal. It is an acknowledgement of the multi-faceted nature of this problem.

He desperately wanted them to lose every vote (hence the reason he was voting with Tories) because he wanted to bring down the Labour govt and have permanent Conservative rule.

Last time Corbyn and Benn sought to force the Labour party into permanent opposition, people actually *died* on NHS waiting lists and Corbyn didn't care.

Take the north sea for example: To get that of the ground back in the 70's, we gave very generous tax breaks to companies willing invest. However once the oil was flowing we hiked the taxes right up, and overall the north sea oil boom has earned us tens of billions in tax revenue over the last 30 years. 

We are currently trying to promote fracking via tax breaks though, I'll give you that. But again the same thing will be true: As soon as the industry matures the tax rates will ramp up quickly.

This is opposed to renewables, where we both offer tax breaks and very large direct subsidies, and yet they still can't compete with fossil fuels on a straight £/W basis.
