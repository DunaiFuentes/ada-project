If you can get past the constant pressure to ensure that all of your children make progress (and that's progress according to exam results nowadays) despite the needs or experiences of the child, then you'll be fine. Schools are under huge pressure for every child to be making progress all of the time, for fear of Ofsted. 

For example: a school where 4 pupils hadn't made level progress that term failed Ofsted despite having the best outcomes in the local authority. One child's father had just been murdered, another was new to the school. Inspectors said they were making excuses.

One lesson at another school during Ofsted was failed during the lunch break - inspectors hadn't seen the lesson, but when they looked in books a small number hadn't finished. Apparently children should all be able to work at the same speed in this robotic education system.

Older teachers in particular are being driven out of schools by threatening them with capabilities. Some schools' use of capabilities can be for something small like one not-so-good lesson (and a good lesson is not easy - every child needs to make progress within that observed part of the lesson - one lesson observation of 5 minutes as children got changed for PE was awarded ""requires improvement"").

There is a culture of fear in many schools, and pay progression is used to control this. Teachers are now less likely to work together, but now against each other, to move up the pay scale. This just cannot be sustained.

I work in Stokes Croft, and I will happily say that some cyclists can be absolute dicks.

Spend any time near the Bearpit or near The Canteen and you'll see a cyclist being an absolute bellend; jumping lights when people are trying to cross, speeding down the ramp to the bearpit and not slowing or moving for the corner. I could go on.

I used to cycle from Brislington to Clifton, and all in all it wasn't too bad. That being said, in the rain and cold it was an absolute nightmare. In a year and a bit of cycling I was knocked off three times. One was my fault (bikes and cobbled streets don't mix), and two other times were cyclists either overtaking me or going down the wrong side of the road (near the marriott on college green). Now that I work in Stokes Croft I'd rather take my car since I can park fairly easily.

With all that being said, I think a lot of cyclists sugar-coat the experience of cycling in sometimes. Cycle around the centre and you'll be fine, but the infrastructure is still pretty poor outside of the main routes.

He's also always reluctant to shoot and honestly, its very frustrating when he's in possession because the pace of the game just dies off. 

Obviously, milner should have started over nasri. Milner keeps showing his worth every time he plays, if it requires assurances that he starts before he signs on, then assurances he should get. In my eyes he's proved he deserves in the team.

Aguero had a poor game, aside from his chance off the bar. Sometimes he is very sloppy and also selfish at the wrong times.

Dzeko wasnt providing much...which is always frustrating. I like Edin and I really want to be behind the guy, but he can be next to useless at points.

Traore did well on the left, finally getting a chance to operate as a midfielder again.  His pace and defensive qualities proved useful.  Phillips was another winger who got a chance today and just like Traore, I thought he did well.  We finally played Fer centrally and while not prolific he was consistent.  Taarabt also got a chance to play and showed flashes of his previous brilliance but will definitely take a few games to get firing on all cylinders.  Zarate also looked dangerous coming on as a sub and managed to create several opportunities for himself.  Charlie lacked support up front, as he often does, but the crosses were more frequent today and that is a positive sign.

Going forward I think Taarabt and Zarate could have a big impact on our survival.  The two of them, in my opinion, can change a game.  Overall I think we performed better today than in our past 4 or 5 games which is mainly attributed to playing players in their natural position.

Although not his natural position it was odd not to see Isla featuring at RB.  I think a few players who didn't get a chance today can also still contribute to our staying up, that being Kranjcar, Hoilett and Sandro when he is fit.

1) I understand why Coutinho came off. He seemed to have on knock on his knee from an earlier tackle. But what I don't understand is why Sterling came off? I understand he has played a lot recently but then why play him for a full 90M vs Bolton in the FA CUP? Surely a league game is more important? Rickie Lambert should never be coming on in a situation like that. He really doesn't even have the quality to be on our bench. But that's another story.

2) Why did Allen for Lucas instead of moving Emre Can up to CM and putting Lovren back on D. Everton were parking the bus anyways so it's not like we were always under threat where we needed to keep Can there. Allen didn't even play bad or make many mistakes, he just doesn't provide anything. He passes back way to much and is never looking to drive the play forward.

3) Why is the 34 year old Gerrard playing 90M? I don't care that it's his last Derby. This is about the team. He provided nothing the whole game and seemed to always slow our attack down. I honestly can't wait till he is gone and I don't have to worry about him starting or not. 

Bottom line, we will not be a consistent top 4 team with Lambert and Allen as our subs (even Borini too). They simply don't cut it. We need higher quality striker and CM depth in case something like this happens again...

CPS guidelines say something like ""if the victim is aged between 13 and 15 and there was no coercion, it should not be prosecuted"". (Authority figures like teachers are a special case - when they have sex with someone, the effective ""age of consent"" legally speaking is 18.)

Of course there are cases mentioned in the context of these grooming gangs where the victims/allegators were under 13 or clearly physically coerced with a gun or something, so even under the most stretched possible interpretation of the CPS guidelines, those cases definitely should have been taken up.

But maybe the prosecution guidelines - or the interpretation of them by some police officers in Rotherham - need to be tightened up in this area, especially when it comes to sex with older men.

I'm paraphrasing, but for instance, if a course is more than 16 hours a week, they consider it to be taking up too much time for you to effectively jobsearch alongside it.  Which is balls.

Either the training in the jobcentre is terrible or they have some wilfully malicious people who just like screwing around.

 It is foolish to keep attacking UKIP a racist, when it as a party is combating racism in it rank, while labour is allowing an openly racist person to continue to represent them.

null,false,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,null,"I don't think I fully understand all the detail of what went wrong in Rotherham. From my reading of this report and the Jay report:

It's a Labour problem in that Rotherham Metropolitan 
Borough Council was a Labour run council, and the elected members allowed child abuse to happen on their watch. The council members and some of the local government officers were shockingly negligent, incompetent, and probably corrupt. They covered up, silenced whistle blowers, and refused to accept the scale of the abuse.

But as I see it the police were even more culpable. The council didn't do enough to tackle child abuse, but when concerns and evidence of actual crimes were passed to the police, little was done.
The report covers this on P46:

&gt;How the police dealt with CSE in Rotherham over the years was not explicitly part of Inspectors’ remit. However, it was not possible to review what had happened in Rotherham without also considering the police’s role.

It seems to me that the root cause (beyond the offenders themselves) is the disdain children in care from poor backgrounds were held in. By the abusers, by the council, and not least by the police:

&gt;Inspectors wondered if some of this inaction was rooted in the attitudes of some South Yorkshire Police officers to the victims. They did not seem to believe the girls or their families or those who reported problems. They did not treat them as victims. 
“The girls were blamed for a lot of what happened. It’s unbelievable and key to why it wasn’t taken seriously as an issue.” A police officer

&gt;“There was no awareness. The view was that they were little slags.” A key partner 

&gt;“They didn’t understand the situation, and thought that the girls were happy, or complicit in it. The sense was that if there had been any offence it had been by the girls, for luring the men in.” A key partner 

This contempt for the victims created a safe space which the abusers took full advantage of. IPCC is investigating SYP, but it seems to me that a whole culture needs changing.

Teams have played in this style for years against us, there hasn't been a sudden awakening in the past month. 

I don't understand how all of a sudden it's Pellegrini's tactics that are called into question.. funny how when we win there's never any talk of his tactics.

His substitutions are often questionable yes 100% but the current problem we have is mainly terrible individual errors in defence, today the players didn't seem bothered but I don't think that's been the problem in other poor matches this month.

People need to look at the situation far more pragmatically. We don't have access to a limitless supply of funding for public spending.

The cuts are deep and painful and as much as I fucking hate the tories, I can see since returning to England that business optimism and the economic outlook are improving

One of the biggest concerns for this country which is wildly under discussed on this subreddit is tax receipts.

If we're to ever return to a point where the NHS isn't crippled and blanket sanctions aren't common place we need more jobs created at above NMW pay rate. 

Taxing the rich is a nice adage, but a far more realistic approach is to increase public spending through greater returns on income tax through better paid jobs.

Anyway here is my take on why we require wingers.... 
With the lack of width means everything is nearly always squeezed down the middle- they just crowd us out and win the ball back (it has happened pretty much every game this season and is extremely boring to watch). When Lennon came on we had finally an out and out winger on the pitch (Mirallas does the job but for me he is not a winger, but more of a centre forward), and he actually brought Coleman into the game for once. Now this is where another issue arises: When Lennon decides to switch wings from the right to the left or vice versa, the other wing is left redundant of a winger. So then Coleman gets the ball, loads of space on the wing but Lennon has switched to the other side.

It would be very nice to see 2 wingers: i.e McGeady and Lennon start a game for us, but Martinez doesn't seem to know how to use wingers this season.

Oh and playing Lukaku on the left wing towards the end was utter bs.

Last season all that Barry really did was make a couple of tackles, and move the ball from the back up the midfield slightly; now this is what is not happening this season. Last season McCarthy was the man that would often be the target of Barry as they slowly moved the play forwards, this season however obviously McCarthy hasn't been present (he was excellent today). Now I know this does not excuse Barry of playing bad, but from my point of view our defence is stronger with Barry just infront of the defenders.
Today when Barry gave the ball away he'd often just hoof it to no where because there is no one making space or moving to get it etc; and this is simply down to lack of width.
With the lack of width means everything is nearly always squeezed down the middle- they just crowd us out and win the ball back (it has happened pretty much every game this season and is extremely boring to watch). When Lennon came on we had finally an out and out winger on the pitch (Mirallas does the job but for me he is not a winger, but more of a centre forward), and he actually brought Coleman into the game for once. Now this is where another issue arises: When Lennon decides to switch wings from the right to the left or vice versa, the other wing is left redundant of a winger. So then Coleman gets the ball, loads of space on the wing but Lennon has switched to the other side.

It would be very nice to see 2 wingers: i.e McGeady and Lennon start a game for us, but Martinez doesn't seem to know how to use wingers this season.

Oh and playing Lukaku on the left wing towards the end was utter bs.

Edit: Pienaar may be [Poor language removed] but he brings Baines into the game, and I would desperately like to see Lennon, McGeady or Oviedo do this; I'd say Atsu too but he doesn't seem strong/good enough to start for us.

There are much more effective methods of moisturising!
Caroline Hirons talks about this in more detail here: http://thebeautyfoodie.com/caroline-hirons-cutting-through-the-skincare-crap/
It's a pretty controversial topic, though, as Paula's Choice totally oppose what Caroline says here: http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/mineral-oil


A generally good routine is to cleanse, tone, exfoliate, serum and then moisturise. But if you're on a tight budget you can use one or the other when it comes to serums and moisturisers (both is generally best). 
You don't even necessarily have to use different cleansers/toners AM/PM - but making sure you do cleanse both AM/PM is important. Also, if you are wearing makeup, you must make sure to remove all of it! Otherwise everything else you put on your skin afterwards will go to waste.
If you replaced the vaseline with the same moisturiser you use in the AM, I think you may start seeing a difference. 

Try to stay away from ""scrubs"" as more often than not rather than exfoliating the skin in the right way they just act as an irritant and can actually provoke ""break outs"". If you want to exfoliate your skin to help clean your pores and prevent clogging which leads to blackheads, try an AHA or BHA exfoliant (here's some really good info: http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/anti-aging/_/how-to-exfoliate-skin).

If you're using BHA or AHA, you should really consider using SPF during the day to protect from UV damage (even if it's cloudy!). An SPF 15 or anything above that will be enough to cover your face. For some advice on what to look for with sunscreens: http://www.skinacea.com/sunscreen/choose-right-sunscreen.html#.VNauRUuZb1o

One example would be certain segments of the Kashmiri Pakistani population. In Kashmir, corruption is normal.

Want to get your child into school, you'll need to bribe the headmaster, or your child won't get in. Want to drive, you'd better carry a wad of cash, because the police will pull you over randomly, and you'd better have a generous bribe available to avoid being arrested on a fabricated charge.

Similarly, it's an accepted occupational hazard for company directors, to get threats against their business, or families, unless they pay protection money.

I think unfortunately we've leaned a bit in this direction since the CL season, but what I'm getting at is the fickleness and shame of Arsenal fans. The way they hide when things don't go right. You look at LFC fans or Everton fans or Newcastle fans or historically our fans and no matter what you don't get the sense that they're ashamed of anything. Arsenal fans always seem to be seeking validation...like they're not actually secure in whether or not they actually love their club. It's bizarre. 

I mean I know our fans have booed and left early and all that shit in recent years, but I just can't fathom our fans treating a figure like Arsene Wenger like their fans do. The man basically IS Arsenal; he has pretty much given that club its identity. And they frequently treat him like complete shit. They're entitled to everything, and they don't miss an opportunity to tell everyone that.

Basically the range is the best form of security for the cards, you have to be closer than you think to swipe someone's data. Card information is entirely in plain text if you use a legit card reader and read the output from that (it handles all the security for you...). I went two hours on the tube during rush hours with a reader (not logging any actual data) and got only one hit. 

Biggest security issue is your phone. The cards make one time CCV codes for contactless transactions, and check them off a list the bank also has. If the card uses one twice or skips one, it's been skimmed and the bank knows. But if you keep your contactless card by your phone with NFC enabled, a virus could pass communication between yours and an attacker's phone while they pay for something. Questions and answers are passed from the till to your card over the Internet, neither have any idea they're not in range and the transaction is legit. Build a big number of compromised phones, and an attacker could cycle victims, even build in tools to make themselves less obvious. This has been demonstrated before, and there's no sure way to prevent it.

Then they have to formally let the ISPs know that they want the new site added to their block-list, then the ISPs have a bit of time to actually implement the filtering (according to them this is both expensive and time-consuming).

There are rumours that there's some change of priority at the MPAA - something to do with Sony threatening to pull out due to the MPAA's unhealthy obsession with online copyright infringement (and all the money they're wasting at it), rather than anything useful. It's possible that they're not going to bother keeping up with this - either because they've got enough evidence now to see that blocking is having minimal effect, or they think TPB is already dead enough and won't draw back as many users, or it just isn't worth the cost.

I pondered a bit upon Wenger earlier today, if I would have wanted him at Spurs. Of course I wouldn't want him now, but even tho I despise Arsenal I feel forced to acknowledge Wenger. You may say that he's old and have no ambitions, he maybe sees it as a routine job and not a challenge, but he has won the league and recently won the FA Cup, not to mention that it's as if he has a permanent pass to Champions League qualification - where I think they usually do well in the group stages. 

In a way it's like they have everything that we want, as a short-term goal. We want more, we are hungry, we wanna see how far we can go. They seem somewhat content/pleased with where they are, almost like they look to having a go at the league every year but the longer the season drags on the more they start to feel pleased ending up in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th place. It *is* like they are soulless, they have second-hand ambitions and it's almost as if they want to bemoan their club/manager/players. But maybe I'm looking at every Arsenal fan like if they were Piers Morgan, who today changed opinion from ""Wenger is actually making a difference, I can't believe it"" to ""Wenger out"" in a matter of minutes as the game wore on. Also the recent incident with Arsenal fans harassing Wenger on some metro or train comes to mind.

null,false,a_hirst,null,null,null,"Students (Tier 4 visas), high skilled workers (Tier 2 visas), investors (Tier 1 visas), and spouses (appendix FM) make up the most of it. There are lots and lots of other kinds of visas that are less common too, such as overseas domestic worker, UK ancestry, etc. 

There are more and more students coming to the UK every year; UK universities are highly respected, and it brings in a huge amount of money. There are fewer Tier 1 and Tier 2 migrants than there used to be (I think) because those routes have been highly scrutinised recently. Lots of Tier 2 sponsor licenses were revoked, and large abuses of the Tier 1 route were discovered and eradicated. 

Asylum grants are exceptionally rare: less than 5% of asylum seekers are granted. 

Edit: I should point out that there is a big difference between temporary and permanent residence. Tier 1, 2, and 4 visas are temporary, with no expectation that the migrant will remain in the UK long term. It's actually extremely difficult to become *settled* in the UK (indefinite leave to remain). Most of the foreign-born residents you're referring to will be here on temporary visas and will return to their country of origin after a period of time. The only major route to settlement is a family visa (usually the spouse route), or a grant of asylum. The vast majority of immigration is temporary.

**Edit again**: I should also point out another big misunderstanding here - it's very hard for an *unskilled* non-EEA migrant to enter the UK these days (without entering illegally, of course, or overstaying a visit visa, but this is obviously illegal and difficult to achieve without being caught). You don't tend to get many unskilled immigrants coming to the UK to study, because it is extremely expensive and thus only popular with wealthy migrants who are genuinely after a good education (although I will admit abuse has been rife in the past, e.g. students working 40 hour weeks and only attending college just enough to not get expelled, or paying extremely little to a bogus college and not attending at all, but this abuse is no longer any way near as common as it used to be due to a huge crack down by the Home Office in recent years). Tier 1 investor/entrepreneur isn't common with unskilled migrants as it's extremely expensive by its very nature and requires a lot of business knowledge. There was some abuse of this in 2013/2014, but again, there's been a huge crack down. Overseas domestic workers have never been very common, because there is no real incentive to employ an overseas domestic worker over a British domestic worker as they both have to be paid the same and treated the same. There was abuse here (and probably still is), but it was more of an abuse *towards* the migrant rather than *by* the migrant. Some horrible examples of human trafficking here. And, as I said before, it's extremely hard to get a grant of asylum, so refugees are quite rare.

Marriage is probably the only real way unskilled non-EEA migrants can enter the UK these days, but it's now less popular because of the recent earnings cap introduced last year (have to be earning £18,600 or have quite a large amount of savings, need to demonstrate they won't use public funds).

Because of all the above, there are very few unskilled non-EEA migrants coming to the UK any more. Most unskilled immigrants are from the EEA. The figure OP states is probably related to historical immigration from non-EEA countries in the 50s, e.g. India and Jamaica, and the children of these immigrants, who are now adults (and some maybe have their own children).

A decent punch is something you have to practise and its more likely to make you seem a lot more like the aggressor to both the police and your opponent and any entourage of theirs.       
For me personally - if somebody gets physical with you keeping your own momentum and balance and pushing forwards at the aggressor with your arms / shoulders is how I've managed to avoid any serious injuries from fights. They aren't gonna find it easy to take a swing at you when they are struggling to keep on their feet.

I never have a problem with him shooting, you can tell his technique is sound and a few goals will most certainly come eventually.  Such a good ball winner.  I would almost classify him as a destroyer but that would undersell his ability to play the quick pass and get us moving forward.  I honestly think that's a big reason why rose and walker are looking more and more dangerous.  Mason draws attention in the midfield and of course Hurrikane is drawing a crowd up front.  All of this attention down the middle opens up the flanks for those two, and I would argue that on both walker and rose's accounts that they're best when they're going forward.

I found that rent rates on the north side of Cambridge (and the surrounding villages on the north side) were much more sane. Eventually I found a place in [Landbeach](https://goo.gl/maps/oBWtV) with a rent of about £550, and it was a nice area (but very quiet, too quiet for me), and I ended up saving about £100 a month most months, including nights out most weeks.

It's worth noting that Cambridge has bad traffic, but reasonably good public transport. It has the Guided busway that ships commuters in/out of the city from the surrounding villages, it has a train line running from Kings Lynn to London, and it has a popular park and ride scheme, so the surrounding area doesn't disconnect you from the city itself.

A player's work off the ball is equal to the time they spend on it, and today Lamela drifted inside too often without regard for Dembele's positioning. That kind of play often resulted in jamming central passing channels, forcing drops to the pivots, or isolating Kyle on the right in attack, and forcing him to occupy both attacking and defensive responsibilities simultaneously. He was lucky that the team kept possession well in that regard.

Lamela also gave the ball away cheaply on a number of occasions as he is wont to do. When he does, to his credit, he is usually quick to track back and press the counter, but drifting centrally to do a bunch of stepovers, quick one-twos with Eriksen and Dembele before dropping the ball back and not spraying it wide into space isn't ideal attacking play.

I don't think Lamela is a poor player by any means. He obviously has loads of individual and technical talent. He needs to learn decision making in attack, however, and rein in the superstar mentality. There isn't a lot of space for individual ambition in this current team and its style of play.

This was definetely Pochettino's tactic though. By occupying the halspace between Koscielny and Gibbs it leaves Mertsacker isolated on Kane.

At City he's had to adapt to a different role though. He's best used as the target man, a position he doesn't play that often at City. When played with Aguero he often plays behind striker which is not ideal for him. Also City's style of play doesn't really suit him.

I love Physics, right now it's my only 7 subject, I'm also a fan of communications - especially modern stuff. So you'd think I'd be taking the IB Physics with comms course right? The one that includes the inner workings of fibre optics, cell phone networks, etc?

Nah, I'm taking some option I've forgotten the name of because it'll be easier.

Given my interest in urban design (have a look at my subreddit list), you'd think I'd do my economics essay on externalities in modern urban design, which I even looked into briefly last year? Nope. Market structure of some business I've never used. Much easier, follows the existing model. 

Originally academics were all about thinking. It was a tight enough network to do that. Likewise I think it's still the same in the upper halls of academics, but for the standard Primary, high, uni course we put a large amount of the population through, we gave up and made them sit nice, standardized tests.

Some people at my school have done extraordinarily well, gaining 40+ diplomas which would allow them to study at some of the best unis in the world. Most go to some uni I've never heard of. There's no interest in following a career that could lead to discovery or innovation, or one that could push them towards really great things.

Nine introduced plenty of people to Doctor Who and showed them the wonders of the world and how people could change, like Rose. Nine had a big heart and wasn't afraid of a challenge and if he was ever uncertain (finale), he'd admit it with pride because even though he's a Time Lord, he wasn't perfect and fearless, wasn't willing to make ANY sacrifice.

If you want to learn to defend yourself you'll have to take classes, or learn to verbally defuse situations, or have a really fast running speed.

At the moment, we're in pretty good shape. We have a good manager who used to play for Palace. We have a pretty good squad which we just added to in the January transfer window. We're also owned by fans who care about the club, and are improving it in a financially stable way. The goal is to become an ""established"" premier league club.

We haven't always been this successful. We're known for being a ""yo-yo club"" where we would often get promoted and relegated. This is the only time we've stayed in the premier league for more than one season at a time.

At the start of the season we were promoted to the premier league, we were favourites to get relegated. The next season in the premier league, we were favourites to get relegated. At the start of this season ,we were one of the favourites to get relegated.

We went into administration in 2010, and our club was nearly lost. Four fans bought it and since then we have made great progress. 

We're proud of our academy where a lot of good players have come from including Wilfried Zaha, Nathaniel Clyne, Victor Moses, Johnny Williams.

The Palace youtube channel has recently started to upload decent videos: http://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialCPFC/videos

Doctor Who is about an alien whose from a race called the Time Lords who live on the planet Gallifrey. He ran away from his home planet and stole a time machine called the T.A.R.D.I.S. (acronym for time and relative dimension in space) which disguises itself as a blue police box. No one knows his real name, but he calls himself the Doctor. Every time he introduces himself people ask 'Doctor Who?' hence the name of the show. He travels all over time and space having adventures and saving the world, usually accompanied by one or more companions (who he does not have sex with!!! though romance has occurred) Whenever the Doctor is seriously injured, he does this Time Lord thing called regeneration, where basically he gets a new face and personality. Time Lords have twelve regenerations (so thirteen faces). That's why so many different actors have played the Doctor, each with a different spin on the character, but overall its really the same person. 

This is just the skeleton of the show, but really its full of epic time travel storylines, amazing characters, humor, and heart. Really, anything you could possibly want in a show it has. And thats all I think I can tell you without spoiling too much for you. If you do decide to watch (and I do recommend it) I suggest starting with series 1 episode 1 of the 2005 series, titled 'Rose.'

Read the top comment in the thread that's written by a current police officer. Armed police are only being used because there are not enough regular police. They aren't there acting in their armed role, they are there acting as regular police officers. The only difference is that they will always be carrying a holstered pistol.

&gt; UK cops are only slightly less untouchable than US ones when they decide to beat or shoot someone to death.

As I said in my original comment, there should be punishments for wrongful killing. However, our armed police are some of the most restrained in the world. Despite the few mistakes they've made, they are definitely one of the police units the UK should be proud of because they do do a good job.

Er no.  Roads pre-date the internal combustion engine by many hundreds (sometimes thousands) of years.

But if there isn't enough space on the pavement then people have every right under the law to use the roads.

Imperial Rome was financial dominated by the senatorial class, an agrarian society with, in effect, 300 families or so of major traders, investors, moneylenders, military leaders and politicians. Wealth disparity was mindbogglingly vast - in the ratio of tens of thousands to one if not higher than that. Some historians have suggested that during the time of Augustus the notable three hundred families owned more than 99% of all wealth in the empire.

She has spent her entire life, working well beyond retirement age, doing that job flawlessly. I am yet to see or hear a person criticize her who has any sort of moral or philosophical high ground from which to level criticism at such a reputable person, whose actions demonstrate the quality of her character.

I also think that while people talk him down, Charles will probably do the same. He might have a different style and approach and particularly one in which he is more publicly vocal - but that isn't something to necessarily be afraid of... because again his job is to be an advocate for the British people. He might have some quirky ideas about complimentary medicine and country living but when it comes to the things that really matter in peoples lives I think Charles will continue to push for the same sense of moral standards that the Queen does.

One of the biggest annoyances for me is that, despite earning a respectable salary, albeit a bit less that yours, I'm not really able to save very much because the cost of living here is not dissimilar to London, but without London wages. It's definitely possible to live pretty centrally on your own if you're happy to work and spend everything you earn that month, but otherwise you've gotta live a decent distance out. 

Secondly, a big consideration for me was not feeling isolated in a new city.

In addition the very definition you post says ""over which the public have a right of way **for the passage of vehicles**""  which also doesn't match what you are saying.

Here is what the police have to say,
 
&gt;**Organising a protest march or static demonstration**
&gt;**Organising a protest march**

&gt;Organisers of public processions are required by law to notify police AT LEAST 6 DAYS BEFORE the event occurs, of the date, time, proposed route and the name and address of an organiser.

&gt;Completion of the form 3175 (to be found in the ‘Related publications box on this page) satisfies the legal requirement to notify police of a public procession under sections 11(1) and 11(3) of the Public Order Act 1986.

&gt;6 days is the MINIMUM PERIOD OF NOTICE. Organisers should try to give as much notice as possible.

&gt;If you wish to organise a protest march then please return the completed form 3175 to your local police station. These are available to download from this page in either PDF or Word formats.

&gt;Notification can also be made by sending your completed forms to MPS Event Planning.

&gt;**Use of the roadway on a protest march**

&gt;If there is an intention to use the road for any march then authority must be sought from the persons who own the roads for use other than vehicular traffic. The bulk of these are governed by the relevant local authority.

&gt;Please identify in which Borough the roads lie. Contact them and seek advice over the issue of a Temporary Traffic Order (TTO).

and the government

&gt;**Protests and marches: letting the police know**

&gt;By law you must tell the police in writing 6 days before a public march if you’re the organiser.

&gt;Tell the police the:

&gt;* date and time of the march
&gt;* route
&gt;* the names and addresses of the organisers

&gt; The police have the power to:

&gt;* limit or change the route of your march
&gt;* set any other condition of your march

&gt;If you arrange a march at short notice, you must still tell the police as soon as you can.

&gt;The police can also:

&gt;* change the location
&gt;* limit how long a rally lasts
&gt;* limit the amount of people who attend

History tells us who we used to be, documentaries tell us who we are now; but heroes tell us who we want to be.

And a lot of our heroes depress me. 

But when they made this particular hero, they didn't give him a gun -- they gave him a screwdriver to fix things. 
They didn't give him a tank or a warship or an x-wing fighter -- they gave him a box from which you can call for help. 
And they didn't give him a superpower or pointy ears or a heat-ray--they gave him an extra heart. They gave him two hearts.

Vehicles are inanimate objects, they have no rights.  Nonetheless, motorists do not have any rights - they have *entitlements*, granted by a *licence*.  I suggest you learn and appreciate the difference between rights and entitlements because that information may be useful if you ever find yourself in a position where your driving licence is about to be taken from you.

null,false,APOPO_Robin,null,null,null,"&gt; I've never understood why the people raising the money get the plaudits.  

Because in most cases without the fundraiser money would not be raised for a particular cause. And I don't think it is just the facilitator who gets credit, take supermarket fundraising, after the event there will often be posters up saying something like ""Thanks to your support we raised £2000 which will be used for x"". Donors need to be cultivated and thanks is a major part of that. 

As you acknowledge, fundraising is sales, but sales people exist for a reason, because they generate more income than would otherwise exist. I've worked for charities in comms and fundraising for nearly a decade and fundraisers have targets to meet which at their lowest are 3 to 1 meaning they have to generate at least 3 times more than they cost. That's a big win for a charity. 

&gt; Its the people who donate who contribute part of their economic output to the charity so that they can do good things. 

You are right, but the volunteer is also donating their time, which has a value to both the individual and the charity, as well as often costs to get there and back, food and the rest. Most volunteers don'tr charge expenses and if you consider that they have costs means that they are often making as decent financial contribution. 

&gt; The actual role of the person raising the money is relatively limited. 

Presence matters. People need to be prompted to give and volunteers enable charities to do more for less, they deserve great credit and contribute millions of hours in extra capacity which has a high value. Many organisations wouldn't exist without them. Donations are often built on relationships and the ability to convey the importance of a charities work, good volunteers who can create good relationships with communities can make a big impact and not everyone is able to do what these people did. 

&gt; If it were a product the charity are the ones making it and getting it to market and the givers are the consumers, the people who raise money are just the sales people.

Yes, but volunteer sales people. Trying to sell something in a super congested market in an environment they are often not especially welcome. It's not an easy job to be honest, most people will refuse to donate (quite understandably) and it can quickly become demoralizing. 

&gt; surely they deserve less than the people who are actually helping people by donating or doing the charity? 

Individual donors do not make as much of a contribution to a single charity as a volunteer does. Someone giving £1 in a bucket once a year generates far less for a charity than someone facilitating that giving every weekend. 

Lastly, the volunteers are ""doing the charity"" as you put it. With government cutbacks public contributions are more valuable than ever. Revenue generation is the foundation of charity, without it you cannot provide services or support. Fundraising / Sales is as important to a charity as it is to any other business, if they can't generate a surplus they can't fulfill their charitable objectives. It's necessary and people like these in the article enable charities to reach more people and have more of an impact than a single donor ever could. 

I've been working in this area most of my life and I'm happy to answer any questions. I hope I've suitably addressed some of your points and would be interested in your response. I'm not trying to argue, rather just present the side of the volunteer / charity.

I'd sooner have someone bred and educated from birth for the role than some halfwit inbred estate dweller, voted into the role by popular demand.

In a sense society has more control over a monarch than they'll ever have over any elected leader. The choice to develop them into that role over their whole life. For someone like David Cameron being successful means keeping his current job before moving on to autobiographies, talks, chairman roles and book tours. For Elizabeth II I think it means something deeper and more intrinsic to who she is. 

It would be unfair to think Elizabeth II ""took"" the crown. **We** made her fit the crown, so begrudging her for a good background is senseless.

I wish we could all move on from this idea that every person in a position of power has to be elected through some popularity contest into the role, and have some XFactor rags to riches backstory. Life doesn't work that way and its a delusional fairytale to think there aren't people out there that are successful because they've been fortunate enough to have the train tracks laid out in front of them. Elizabeth II is a product of her upbringing... but at the same time you couldn't have elected a better head of state. The sad part is, people with rags to riches stories tend to be selfish career meteorites with a streak for survival that doesn't necessarily translate into a selfless role as head of state.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"* The first link explains that the Monarch (not the Royal family, and you are confused here in several links about the distinction between the two which is significant) has the power to veto certain aspects of bills put before parliament. If you actually look at the examples where the veto has been used, it was only used to protect the relationship between the Crown and the Palace of Westminster. For example they vetoed a bill which would have transferred power to authorize military action against another state to parliament, feeling instead that as commander in chief and head of state that role rightfully belongs to her majesty. They also vetoed part of the civil partnerships act which would have bound her majesty regarding the validity of such marriages and it was felt that power should not forced on the monarch. To me this makes perfect sense and is part of the process of maintaining our constitutional settlement when new laws are written. It is a way of protecting the Monarch from the legislative power of parliament to pass laws that make them redundant to the legislative process. If you don't like that, you probably don't understand or appreciate the relationship between crown and state. 

* On your second and third point, the Monarch (again confusion over the distinction between the Royal Family and the monarch.. the latter being head of state and the former having no actual specific definition) and their influence over legislation. Queen Elizabeth has met with every single Prime Minister from Winston Churchill to David Cameron almost every tuesday for the last 63 years. Put yourself in Camerons shoes... that must be all sorts of intimidating, going to report to a woman who counciled Churchill. If you think she doesn't have clout to influence legislation you'd be kidding yourself... in much the same way that when Bill Gates speaks, governments listen, because he is by the nature of what he is, influential. It might not seem fair, but thats life. As head of state I don't begrudge her being able to discuss, with politicians, matters of personal interest to her. She has no power to create legislation so effectively she can only lobby like the rest of us. It's just they are more likely to hear her voice than ours - doesn't mean they are any more likely to take it on board.

* Your final Yougov link is factually misunderstood on your part. The Monarch is the corporation sole who has the legal right to act as the head of state of the legislature, judiciary and executive. The Royal Family are simply the family of the monarch and by extension those in the line of succession. They are called the Royal Family because they are a famous family, like the Arquettes, the Baldwins or the Rothschilds. There is no actual definition of who is in the royal family and the term is nebulus for those related to, or in, the line of succession. 

* **The Royal Family do not receive funding.** It is **the Monarch** who receives funding through something called the Sovereign Grant which is actually money given to the monarch in exchange for the revenues from the Crown estates which are substantially larger than the funds she receives back. The Crown Estate is their property granted, in perpetuity at the start of each new reign to the Government, and it is their right and entitlement to profit from that land, unfair as that might seem to you. There are substantially smaller arrangements that also cover the Duchy of Cornwall for the Prince of Wales as 1st in line to the throne, but otherwise the ""Royal Family"" are not covered. You cannot ""slim down"" the Royal Family anymore than you can ""Slim Down"" your own family, or the Baldwins or the Rothschilds. Now, if the Queen chooses to use part of the Sovereign Grant to support her family, that is her right and entitlement as a private citizen, and if you don't like it you can essentially fuck off... It's no different to you supporting a child through university in principle, it's her money and she can do what she wants with it.

You could hop over to /r/gallifreylive and catch up with them - they've recently got into Pertwee on their weekly rewatch.

If you want more modern TV, then there is Torchwood, of course, and the Sarah Jane Adventures. SJA is primarily aimed at kids, but push through the first few episodes and it actually gets really good. In some ways it's more ""mature"" than the look-at-me-I'm-grown-up style that Torchwood took in the early days.

Otherwise you've got the [Big Finish Audios](http://www.bigfinish.com/hubs/v/doctor-who). There are more hours of BF audio than NuWho and Classic Who combined, so that'll keep you going for a while. You might want to start with the Eighth Doctor. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/2o0qx3/where_to_start_with_mcgann_audiobooks/) a discussion of the best listening order for him.

Then there are over 300 novels  - and hundreds of short stories) to choose from. Take a look over [here](http://www.drwhoguide.com/books.htm) for the series (though it's not too up to date, there are three [12th Doctor novels](https://whopix.wordpress.com/2014/09/06/new-novels-previews/) and a [short tale](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-12-Doctors-Stories/dp/0141359889/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423394101&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=12+doctors+12+stories) too, for example).

Also there are numerous comics. Titan are currently producing [three ongoing titles](http://titan-comics.com/comics/?tag=series:doctor-who): Tenth, Eleventh &amp; Twelfth Doctors. Overall the Eleventh is proving most consistently interesting, but the current arcs in the other two are pretty good too. IDW have had the licence until recently and have produced plenty of good titles too, and then there are the [graphic novels](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=doctor%20who%20graphic%20novels) collecting the comics from DWM.

The emails are nothing incriminating whatsoever. The university were concerned about people turning up who might cause problems. They biased with the police. The police did what police do and offered to run names through a database or to try and spot troublemakers. They didn't ""demand a list of people attending"" or anything remotely like that.

If we even look at the exact quote (which the guardian chopped the first few words off obviously):

&gt;“require to know when the tickets are issued will the name of who is in the receipt of the tickets be recorded? (Blacked out) if they are there will need to be some R&amp;D”.

It isn't even asking for a list of names. It's asking whether names will be recorded when people book tickets. Presumably then so that they could be looked up in a database or something if needed. They were hardly trying to get a list of attendees to put them on a watchlist.

And I don't like the editorialised chopping off the quote. Maybe it was ""If you want us to check for potential protesters then we would require to know..."", which is suddenly not very demanding at all.

And when the uni said they probably couldn't give names due to data protection, the police said:

&gt;“No problem. The main issue is numbers rather than names. I have asked for any info our end which we can pass onto you”.

and

&gt;We don’t really need the names. It would be nice but not essential. I fully understand the concerns about releasing that information without the relevant data protection application in place.

Hardly a forceful ""seeking to obtain names"" is it?

And after that it looks like the university had epic amounts of uninformed miscommunication. One professor said they had ""been asked by Special Branch for a list of everyone who will be attending"", which is obviously totally untrue.

Then a whole load of academics and an unrelated green party councillor proceeded to jump on the bandwagon, take offence over this misinformed, badly communicated statement and get all of their knickers in a twist.

It's 100% a non-story. The guardian really has gone to shit.

Exclusive interview: Is Ed Miliband ready?
 
George Parker and Jim Pickard
 
Business leaders complain he’s anti-capitalist, cartoonists depict him as Mr Bean and his personal polls are dire. Yet he will be prime minister if the Labour party wins the general election — and he certainly believes he is up to the job.
 
Ed Miliband is going down a storm with the students of Hazelwood college in north Belfast. He looks relaxed. He is self-deprecating and engaging, unrecognisable from the wooden, supposedly hapless and electorally toxic figure portrayed by his critics — the man said by some to be leading his party to electoral defeat in the general election on May 7.
 
Miliband chats happily with the teenagers, discussing the pitfalls of social media, advocating votes for 16 and 17-year-olds, attacking tax-dodging multinationals; he is funny, and free of the usual soundbites crafted by his office to keep him out of trouble. Then one student asks Miliband if politics is only open to people of a certain class, and the Labour leader’s eyes flash: “I’m the son of two immigrant parents who fled the Nazis,” he says. “If you said to my grandparents I was the leader of the Labour party and may be the next prime minister, they would have been pretty surprised.”
 
Others would be surprised, too, if Miliband wins the election. David Cameron says he is “useless”; Tony Blair has suggested his Labour successor’s programme is too leftwing to get him into Number 10 and business leaders complain that he has no interest in the workings of a capitalist economy — with the boss of Boots this week saying a Miliband government would be “a catastrophe”. No opposition leader has ever won an election trailing the incumbent prime minister both on leadership qualities — Populus pollster Rick Nye says he fails the “blink test” when voters are asked if they can imagine Miliband in Downing Street — and economic competence. George Osborne, the chancellor, says that “water would have to start flowing uphill” if Labour is to overcome these two obstacles to win the election.
 
Yet Miliband does not look like a broken man. On the way out into the crisp Ulster morning, the students crowd round him, grabbing selfies. There is a collective sense of surprise that Miliband has not turned out to be completely “weird” — the word selected by 41 per cent of people in a recent poll to describe him. “I think he’s a brilliant speaker,” says Caoimhe Boyd, a 17-year-old student. “He’s more down to earth than I expected.” Leo Kamutsi, another sixth-former, agrees: “I think he’s a nice guy, a genuine bloke. I think he would be a suitable prime minister.” But Miliband’s problem is not with the students of Hazelwood — Labour does not field candidates in Northern Ireland and most of them are too young to vote anyway — but with the rest of the country. As Miliband heads into Belfast for a round of political talks, an aide jokes: “Now we just have to get him to meet 20 million voters.” With the general election only three months away, the Labour leader is running out of time.

Whatever people might think of Edward Samuel Miliband when they meet him, the polls suggest he is the least popular British opposition leader on record — albeit at a time when all mainstream politicians are unpopular. In November 2010, in the first flush of his Labour leadership, he had an approval rating of +20; four years later it had sunk as low as -55 in a YouGov poll.

While Miliband might have sparkled in front of an audience of students, when faced with hostile questioning — for example, from a business audience — he can appear lacklustre and defensive. “He’s great when he’s with a group of people and it’s a subject he’s interested in,” said one Labour-supporting businessman. “But if he doesn’t agree, he gets quite sulky and doesn’t engage.” Even Miliband’s closest advisers admit the Labour leader’s performance can veer from sparkling to underwhelming. “You never know which Ed is going to turn up,” says one. “With Cameron it’s always the same.”

Cartoonists parody him as a Mr Bean character or draw attention to his resemblance to Wallace, the bumbling plasticine inventor from Wallace and Gromit. Miliband, a thoughtful politician described as “calm and principled” by his supporters, has found it impossible to escape the caricature.

Pictures of him grappling with a bacon buttie became an internet sensation; last month a former supporter revealed how he let a young Miliband — then seeking a parliamentary seat — stay at his house in Doncaster, only for the future Labour leader to lock himself inside the house and set fire to a carpet, almost asphyxiating himself. Miliband later replaced the carpet with a £25 Muslim prayer mat.

A poll by Lord Ashcroft, a Tory millionaire, recently asked members of the public to compare their political leaders to animals. David Cameron, the prime minister, was found to resemble “a fox, being smart and sleek or — less charitably — a giraffe looking down on everybody”. Miliband? “One of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.”
The polls are so unremittingly grim for Miliband personally that it is easy to forget that his party is still in contention to win the election. Indeed, the Labour leader is convinced he will become Britain’s prime minister in three months’ time, and that voters will embrace his agenda of tackling inequality and taming the excesses of capitalism.

Meeting Miliband in person can come as a shock to those who have formed their view of him through the prism of a hostile press or through his stiff, soundbite-ridden television appearances. Sipping a black Americano in Belfast City Airport’s coffee bar, he is witty and animated, exuding an almost boyish earnestness. His dark eyes are less panda-like away from the television lights.

“Well, I think leaders of the opposition always have a battle,” he says, reflecting on how he took over a party in autumn 2010 whose spirit had been crushed in a general election months earlier. “I think if you’d said to most people in our party four-and-a-half years ago, this election will be ours to win — which I think it is — people wouldn’t have believed us.”

Miliband’s Labour critics do not share his confidence. So much so that, last autumn, party grandees gauged whether they could stage a coup by toppling the leader and installing the popular former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson in his place. Miliband denied talk of a coup last November as “nonsense”. But the FT has learnt that two Labour grandees — Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary, and Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former press chief — took soundings from Johnson to see whether he was prepared to take over. “Alan gave an emphatic No,” says one Labour MP. Another senior party figure claimed that at least 40 MPs supported the abortive coup — others claim far more. Johnson, a former postman, has discovered a new and less stressful life as an author.

Miliband was angry with the unrest but allies say that the episode was indicative of a character trait which the public rarely see in the Labour leader: a remarkable and intense self-belief. “I never saw him nervous, shaky, scared,” says Sadiq Khan, a Labour MP who ran Miliband’s leadership campaign. “There was just a frustration that people were distracted by that nonsense.” Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor of the exchequer, says: “People underestimate him at their peril. There is a steely core there.” Peter Hain, one of the few senior Labour MPs to back Miliband in the leadership contest, speaks of his “courage, vision and utter determination”.

Does Miliband never wake up and wonder whether Labour chose the right brother in that fratricidal leadership contest: that it might have done better opting for David, the older brother, the former foreign secretary adored by Hillary Clinton, the more experienced figure? “Definitely not,” he says firmly. “On the issues that matter most I’ve been proved right: on the cost of living, on responsible capitalism, on the challenge of the vested interests, inequality. I think Britain needs a Labour government and Britain needs a Labour government led by me.”

null,false,Faragaldo,null,null,null,"Ed Miliband was born in 1969, the younger of two sons born to Ralph Miliband, a Belgian-born Marxist academic of Polish Jewish origin, and Marion, a Polish Jew and human rights campaigner. The family settled in Primrose Hill, now one of the most exclusive areas of London.

Much has been written about Ralph Miliband’s influence over Ed’s politics — one shadow cabinet minister says “it’s all about daddy” — although the Labour leader jokes that his father would be disappointed by the scale of his ambitions. “We are talking about how we are going to reform capitalism, not abolish it as my dad would have wanted.”

A defining moment in the young Ed’s life was when, at the age of 12, he went to Boston for several months to keep his father company while he was teaching in the US. He recalls how the two went bowling — and, in a conspicuously un-Marxist moment, to McDonald’s — and Ed developed his love of baseball, and the Red Sox in particular.

“That was quite a special time, because to be with one’s dad without my mum or my brother was really sort of interesting,” he says. “Obviously, I missed my mum and my brother but it was quite a thing.” Why did he go? “My dad was just incredibly lonely, frankly, and my parents thought, well, it may be nice for you to go and have the experience of going to a junior high school in America.”
The Miliband home was intensely political. “For the purposes of being children they treated us like we were kids, but for the purposes of adult conversation they treated us like we were adults. But it was not Marxism over breakfast.”

The 45-year-old describes himself as “an atheist Jew” but says his Jewishness is “a big part of my heritage”. Friends say the Milibands rarely spoke about the Holocaust when the boys were growing up but, recently, Miliband has started speaking more freely about his family.
When he does talk about the Holocaust, as he did again last month in a moving speech to the parliamentary press corps, Miliband finds his own voice. He told the press dinner how recently he learnt for the first time about the death of his maternal grandfather in a Nazi labour camp 70 years ago. For his family, politics was “a matter of life or death”.

Edward and David studied at the same north London state school, which the younger Miliband describes as “an extraordinary place with massive diversity — class diversity, racial diversity, diversity of backgrounds”. During his trip to Belfast Miliband tells students that he was “very good at physics and maths” at school and today he often approaches political decisions as if they were mathematical problems. Aides describe how he can read through policy details and spreadsheets for hours on end. David and Ed then attended the same Oxford college, Corpus Christi, and took the same degree: philosophy, politics and economics.

Both David and Ed worked as backroom boys in the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, but here their political paths diverged. Ed stayed loyal to his mentor Brown, with an emphasis on the traditional leftwing theme of redistribution of wealth, while David helped his boss Blair pursue closer links with business and his attempt to reform public services.

While working with Brown at the Treasury, cabinet ministers started to note that the earnest Ed Miliband was starting to show some political mettle. “Ed was fearless,” said one minister who watched the young adviser help Brown in one of his regular confrontations with Blair. “He would sit in a room behind Gordon and Ed would tell him how to respond. It was like Thomas Cromwell. Tony could hear him.”

In June 2007, Brown became prime minister and brought the two Miliband brothers into his cabinet — the first time siblings had served together at the top of government since 1938. David became foreign secretary while Ed had more of a backroom role at the cabinet office, before later becoming the minister for tackling climate change.

As Brown’s premiership limped to its conclusion in 2010, talk turned to a future leadership contest. David was the clear frontrunner while Ed — given the task of drafting the Labour election manifesto — did not even feature on the radar screens of many cabinet ministers.

“I don’t think any of those in the cabinet thought of him as being a candidate,” says one minister in the Brown government. “But when he was writing the manifesto he had endless meetings with trade union general secretaries, even during the campaign itself. Nobody had any idea. But you have to take your hat off to him: the machinating was superb.”

Ed Miliband was later able to call on the support of those union barons to help him win the leadership, offering them the promise of a break from New Labour with its pro-business stance and political “triangulation” intended to keep the party in the political centre. In other words, a break with the position occupied by his brother.
“I obviously thought quite long and hard about this, what was the right thing to do,” he says. Ed’s decision to run against his brother is said to have broken the heart of his mother Marion, now 80, but the Labour leader suggests he had a duty to run. “I felt I had something distinctive to say about the Labour party and where it should go and how it should move on from New Labour, and that I was the best person to take the party in that direction,” he says.

Miliband offers a programme in which the state intervenes to open up sectors like energy and banking to more competition and acts as a guiding hand to make capitalism work more “fairly” — by boosting skills and incentivising companies to pay higher wages, for example. Higher taxes, especially on the wealthy, would pay for improved services: Miliband wants to cut the cost of going to university.

As with Ralph, the Marxist theoretician, Ed Miliband believes the battle of ideas was paramount; in this case more important than family bonds. Framed like that, Miliband rationalises his decision to run against his brother not in terms of personal ambition but the pursuit of ideology. Indeed, friends say that the one thing that makes Miliband most angry is when he sees colleagues nakedly putting political ambitions ahead of the party. One says: “He doesn’t like people being self-important and vain or in it for themselves.” Staff say that such behaviour can move him to rare outbursts of shouting, laced with heavy-duty expletives.

Miliband admits the leadership contest caused anguish to his older brother. “It was hard, and then, obviously, after the leadership election, continued to be hard. But I think now he’s got this job with the International Rescue Committee [the New York-based humanitarian organisation], which is a good job, it sort of feels like the world has moved on and so have we.” Does he see much of David now? “I see him when he’s over here and we talk. It was tough, but it feels a lot easier and better now.” Friends of the former foreign secretary are not so sure.

Nevertheless, Ed Miliband’s self-belief became apparent during the leadership contest, not just in the audacity to run against his brother but in his apparent certainty he would win. “I was always pretty much convinced I was going to win,” he says. A friend confirms this. He remembers the Labour leader seeing his brother on television and saying: “Poor David, he just doesn’t realise he’s going to lose.” One former ally of Miliband says: “In a way, he is just like David. Both have a deep sense of being right the entire time. Where does it come from? It is the ideological certainty of his father combined with the unconditional love of his mother.”

null,false,Faragaldo,null,null,null,"Miliband lives today in a five-storey house in Dartmouth Park, north London, with his two young sons, Daniel and Sam, and his wife Justine, an environmental lawyer and former child actress whom he met in 2002; she is credited with giving the Labour leader a grounding in the world outside politics.

“Love, joy, patience, support” are the qualities Miliband attributes to Justine, although it is clear the Labour leader’s political role does not allow for the most scintillating of social lives. “What do we do in the evenings?” he says, pensively looking into his coffee. “I sometimes watch telly. We watched half an episode of Broadchurch on Tuesday night.”

He has little interest in fine dining — lunch is often a half-eaten sandwich — and even less in alcohol. One former ally recalls being served glasses with minuscule quantities of wine from a half-empty bottle at the Miliband home: “It was like receiving communion,” he says. His staff say he can stay up late reading papers, making phone calls at 1am — and he devours political commentary. He gave up his iPhone in 2013 because he was obsessively following Twitter and political blogs. But unlike Cameron, Miliband does not do his best work in the morning: “My secret is I’m not a brilliant morning person,” he says. If the children jump on him to wake him up, he “does not like it”.

On the few occasions Miliband attends a social event, he is usually armed with briefing notes on the guests. The hazards of such an approach were exposed at a reception where he started chatting, apparently knowledgeably, about the popular BBC soap opera EastEnders with star actor Danny Dyer. When pressed, Miliband admitted he had never watched the programme.

 . . . 

Miliband decided to confront his dire image problem in a speech last July. “I’m not from central casting,” he said. “You can find people who are more square-jawed, more chiselled, look less like Wallace.” While David Cameron was “a very sophisticated and successful exponent of a politics driven by image”, here was a man interested in substance and ideas. But the speech was an admission of defeat. After all, one of his principal selling points in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 was that he could connect with voters. His campaign sported banners proclaiming that “Ed speaks human” — a dig at David Miliband, who supposedly possessed inferior communication skills. Yet Miliband’s glaring political problem is that he has been unable to transmit any of that to voters, either through a hostile print media or — much more importantly — through the medium of television.
But is Miliband right? If voters can get past the nasal voice, the cartoon-friendly features and the pictures of him doing battle with a bacon sandwich — “it is possible they have not yet reached some yak farmers in Nepal” — will they discover a politician with almost old-fashioned virtues of integrity and ideas: a 21st-century Clement Attlee? Would he make a good prime minister?
Temperamentally, Miliband seems up to the task. Four years of relentless media criticism and internal attacks have not crushed him. “He’s got a thick skin — something Gordon didn’t have,” says one former cabinet minister. While a tortured Gordon Brown stayed up all night muttering to himself “too many mistakes”, Miliband has a preternatural idea that he is doing the right thing. His friends say he does not consider for a minute that he is weighing his party down. Peter Hain says he is a good chairman: “He is very easy, relaxed, quite witty. He asks someone to lead on an issue, then brings other people in on it.” Alistair Darling says: “In terms of decision-making and ensuring he gets things done, he’s perfectly capable of that.”

Yet Miliband’s critics say he can be remote, cocooning himself inside his Edwardian office overlooking the Thames with like-minded leftish policy wonks and cut off from senior MPs in his team. It is noteworthy how few shadow cabinet ministers are prepared to go out and publicly fight for Miliband when he is in trouble.
“He’s a mixture of indecision and dogma,” says one senior Labour figure about his leadership style. But his supporters argue that Miliband can make bold moves once he has analysed a problem, whether standing up to Rupert Murdoch’s powerful press empire over phone hacking, taking on energy companies or refusing to support British military action in Syria in 2013.
“With Syria we had to take decisions very quickly,” says one shadow cabinet member. “Ed was briefed in Downing Street on the situation and Obama wanted to move, but Ed had confidence and conviction. He’s sometimes at his best when he’s ignoring advice.” Cameron saw Miliband’s behaviour as despicable, “playing politics” with national security issues.
However, other decisions can take weeks or months — such as the decision to oppose Cameron’s in/out EU referendum — as Miliband agonises with trusted allies and members of his inner circle. “I think being measured in the decisions you make is quite an important quality in somebody who wants to be prime minister,” Miliband says.
 . . . 
Whatever Miliband’s personal qualities, it is his ideas that concern his critics most, particularly those in business and the City. Miliband rejects the “Red Ed” tag attached to him at the start of his leadership but one senior City figure says: “There’s no doubt in the minds of the business community that he’s the most leftwing Labour leader since Michael Foot.” A policy prospectus which includes a “mansion tax”, a restored 50p top rate of tax, a bank bonus tax, price controls in the energy sector and possible seizures of land from “hoarding” property speculators was never likely to endear him to big business.

Miliband says he wants to tackle two “generational questions” if he wins the election. The first is “how to maintain openness as a country” — an agenda which he hopes will neutralise some business criticism of Labour ahead of polling day. Miliband wants to keep Britain in the EU and keep open its borders, albeit with tweaks to immigration rules, in the face of pressure from the UK Independence party to do the opposite.
But Miliband’s real burning interest is in the second “generational question”: tackling inequality. “This is not about resentment of people who do well,” he says. “I want people to do well. That is essential if we are to succeed as a country. What this is about, however, is a sense of fairness and the idea that those with broad shoulders should bear the greatest burden.” Miliband notes Obama’s recent focus on the fracturing of society and the advantages of the top 1 per cent: “Clearly that would make him a communist in the eyes of some people. And they would be wrong.”

If Miliband is interested in the process of wealth creation that might fund his socialist ideas, he seldom lets on. Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors, says: “It is not that Ed is pro or anti-business, he is ‘abusiness’ — he doesn’t relate to it or understand its needs, values or concerns.” A common refrain is that when business leaders meet Miliband and his inner circle, they hear reassuring noises, but the Labour leader then appears the next day with another speech attacking some other aspect of what he has labelled “predatory” capitalism. Even those in his inner team admit the attacks on “irresponsible” business can seem “a bit relentless”.

New Labour figures like Lord Mandelson, Alan Milburn and Lord (John) Hutton — cabinet ministers in the Blair era — complain that Miliband has dangerously ceded the mantle of economic competence to David Cameron. Critics claim Miliband has crafted a narrow policy prospectus aimed at winning 35 per cent of the vote — just about enough for a Labour victory — which might appeal to the poor and disadvantaged but which has little appeal to the voters of middle Britain.

Although Britain’s economy is growing and unemployment is low, Miliband paints a dispiriting picture of modern Britain, a country which he claims is one of “food banks and bank bonuses”. He says his message is one of optimism and hope but Liz Kendall, a Blairite shadow minister, warned recently that politicians should guard against sounding like “the man moaning in the pub”.

Miliband disagrees with the idea that he held his party together after its 2010 defeat by failing to take it out of its comfort zone, arguing he has reformed Labour’s relations with the unions, toughened the party’s stance on immigration and made it clear that the party would have to cut public spending in most areas. “I actually think I’ve put the party in the right place to win the election and the right place to govern the country,” he says as the final call is announced for the flight back to London. “This is an economy which isn’t working for most people. It’s a strategy of reaching out to people right across the country in all parts of the United Kingdom, so I totally reject the idea that somehow this is about a narrow section of the electorate — quite the contrary.”

But for all Miliband’s confidence, a mood of despair is common among Labour MPs returning to Westminster after campaigning in their constituencies, listening to voters complain about the leader. “Some of our colleagues think optimism is an eye disease,” Alan Johnson quipped last month. Miliband’s office believes some senior figures — notably Andy Burnham, the health spokesman — are already preparing their leadership bids in the event of a Labour election defeat. “If the election is to be lost, they aren’t going to be blamed,” says a former cabinet minister. “Ed will carry the can entirely on his own from their point of view.”

No. We don’t mention him on the doorsteps and it will be interesting to see how many people put him on their leaflets. His relationship with his brother must be terrible. It’s tragic he has given up so much for something he’s not very good at. It was too big a step up for him.”

But Miliband’s political opponents are not so dismissive. David Cameron is trying to avoid holding a television debate with the Labour leader on the grounds that Miliband’s public standing is so low, it could only improve if he was given an “unmediated” chance to talk directly to voters. Lord (Chris) Patten, a former Tory chairman, says: “The thing that would worry me most is that in the campaign Miliband might come across a lot better than the press has said he is: he’s a highly intelligent guy, a good debater.” James Chapman, political editor of the Miliband-baiting Daily Mail, tweeted after Miliband’s speech to the Westminster press dinner: “Superb speech. Another reason for Cameron to dodge those TV debates.”

It will be hard to shift a public perception of him built up over several years of hostile media coverage and time is running out. “Let’s see how it goes. I think the opportunity for the public to hear from me over the course of the three-and-a-half months is a huge opportunity for us.” His critics would say it is another example of self-delusion. But it is also another sign of the Labour leader’s self-belief.

Sadiq Khan tries to explain: “It’s not arrogance. It’s confidence in the decency of the British people. He believes he will win the general election. He believes in the best of people: there’s something almost romantic about it.”
Miliband finishes his coffee and throws on his blue jacket. He knows he is facing a torrid time at the hands of the Tory-supporting press but insists he is ready for it. “If we were miles behind in the opinion polls they wouldn’t be doing it, ” he says, as he heads for the plane. “It’s because they fear I’m going to win.”

From your very own link!

&gt;“carriageway” means a way constituting or comprised in a highway, being a way (other than a cycle track) over which the **public have a right of way** for the passage of **vehicles**;


Now I'm not a lawyer (you sound like you are, or at least want to be) but that seems to pretty explicitly set out a motorists rights.

Frankly you are trying to argue the details and minutiae of legislation so hard you are completely missing how ludicrous your overall position is. Roads are predominately for cars, protests need to get authorization if they want to block them. I have no argued pedestrians cant use roads, we are talking specifically about blocking them here.

&gt;But that would go against people like yourself, who obviously believe the car is king and that everyone else can get the fuck out of its way.

Wanyama is a great guy but I don't know if he's all that loyal, so if there's an offer and his agent gets in his ear then who knows?

As for the rest of the squad its anybody's guess. Like I said the Chambers one seemed to come out of no where.

Red Dwarf is another British SciFi series but with a comedic bent. I guess you could say it's in the vein of something like Hitchhiker's, but it is very much its own beast. It's got 10 seasons last I counted (8 ""classic"" seasons from the late 80's into the 90's, a miniseries and a revived season). It's also got a very stable cast.

On the flip side, Toby Whithouse did Being Human, which is a little more grounded (it's set in a quiet little neighbourhood, but with a vampire, werewolf and ghost trying to live amongst people) so if you're a fan of his Doctor Who stuff that's another slightly fantasy series you could latch onto.

I'm just trying to think outside the box, that's all :) you don't have to take me up on those.

Also - if you're afraid of the episodes being really cheesy, my recommendation would be to watch some of the early Tom Baker classics - for TV 70's the special effects still look very neat and the storylines are inspired by the gothic horror tradition, which a lot of New Who loves to tap into. 

Ones I would recommend include Genesis of the Daleks, Pyramids of Mars, Seeds of Doom and Terror of the Zygons. Graeme Harper (who's directed some modern Who) earned his chops on some late Davison (Caves of Androzani) and early Colin Baker (Revelation of the Daleks), and those two do stand out as some of the better offerings of the mid-80's. 

And remember, even New Who has had some really cheesy episodes :P",null,0,null,1423397525,null,0,false,0,coex1rw,null,t3_2v6kio,null,t1_coex1rw,null,t3_2v6kio,null,null,null,null,null,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

I presume this also involves allowing UK tax authorities to access the list, or at least access to information about UK citizens &amp;/or residents who own companies there.

One can easily imagine a situation in which you're earning £1m per year for your TV appearances - if you earn that in the UK then you pay UK tax on it and have (for example) £600,000 left.

If you subcontract through Rebelius Talent Management (Bermuda) Ltd., then your company puts the whole £1m in the bank, and you only pay tax on the £200,000pa you draw and spend in the UK. In fact, when you decide to buy a house, you can have it purchased by Rebelius Investment Holdings, and pay them rent.

I assume this is all opaque to the British tax authorities at present. 

TFA says ""Bermuda's government said it had operated a central registry of companies since the 1940s"", but that doesn't mean it shows who the *beneficial owners* are, or that the information is shared with HMRC.

Yes some of that is committed by those from cultures that have not caught up with the West in terms of women's rights. But to act as if it is a Muslim problem, and that the issue of rape gangs and rape culture could be solved ""if only we got rid of those damn Muslims"" is disingenuous and ignores the wider problem.

Unless you are suggesting exterminate all the Muslims (and by the way, exterminating an entire ethnic group doesn't tend to go down well), that they are Muslim is not helpful in the discussion on the wider issue of dealing with rape in this country.

And if this report is indicative of how police handle rape cases, there could be many more people being raped that the police have simply dismissed. It's less of an epidemic than in other countries, but that is still an epidemic. I find it amusing that you use the ""by comparison"" argument to state the UK has no rape epidemic when you criticised cultural relativism in the previous point...

The point everyone is making in this thread is whether the situation in Rotherham would have been much different if the rape gang had been non-muslim. The conclusion of the report was that them being Pakistani muslim had only slightly to do with the cases not being handled correctly. The other issues, such as the fact that the victims complaints were dismissed as they were a bit working class, are much more damning - and the fact that The Telegraph chose to ignore them in favour of the political correctness angle is more horrifying, as it lowers the chances that the other issues will be resolved, in favour of racial rhetoric instead.

The fact that you think we don't have a rape problem is exactly why the Muslim narrative isn't helpful even if it happened to be true. We can't start dismissing the horrifying nature of rape in this country as simply a Muslim problem, because it is not.

tl;dr The conclusion of this report isn't, how do with deal with those damn Muslims, its how do we ensure the police actually take rape cases seriously.

&gt;First, there are
increasing doubts about the theory of man-made climate change.

No there are not. Scientists are more and more certain and there have been a huge number of papers highlighting this. This is just a lie, plain and simple. 

Disregards for workers' rights is leaving the EU, there is a huge amount of legislation protecting workers' rights, UKIP would love to get rid of the working time directive for instance-it's not the most popular legislation for their pals in big business. They even highlight they would scrap the Agency Workers Directive which would allow businesses to hire agency workers for less and treat them differently from normal workers (totally can't see how this would be abused). 

They want to scrap the human rights act and leave the ECHR (which has nothing to do with the EU btw) which every country in Europe is a member of-apart from the dictatorship of Belarus. 

So to sum up, UKIP deny some of the least controversial (from a scientific perspective) and arguably most researched science in history, will remove a huge amount of workers' rights legislation massively harming workers whilst helping their big business backers and want to bring British human rights representation in Europe to the same level as the final dictatorship in Europe. What a fantastic party. 

This is just three policies that are mental. Then you've got things like:

* stopping inheritance tax (which only affects people giving &gt;300k anyway) 
* cutting taxes for those earning between 44 and 55k a year, cutting foreign aid (ignoring what foreign aid is and how it actually works just for the populist vote)
* reinstating grammar schools (your future should be decided at age 11)
* giving ex-soldiers guaranteed jobs in the police force
* scrapping the NHS ([which is what UKIP wants regardless of their made up policies](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/leaked-documents-show-ukip-leaders-approve-nhs-privatisation-once-it-becomes-more-acceptable-to-the-electorate-9993050.html))
* cutting emmisions directives that stop unlimited NOx and SOx pollution (yay smog and acid rain)
* letting people give non-smokers lung cancer as they're too lazy to go outside
* ignoring more scientific research on plain packeted cigarettes (I'm surprised they're not saying smoking does not cause cancer at this point)

The much touted idea that there's a rape epidemic has no evidence to support it.  [Statisticians have looked at the figures in the US and there's been an enormous *drop* in rape over the last few decades.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/18/AR2006061800610.html)  

&gt;The number of rapes per capita in the United States has plunged by more than 85 percent since the 1970s, and reported rape fell last year even while other violent offenses increased, according to federal crime data.

It's harder to obtain good data for the UK, but we've seen a general fall in crime and it would be surprising if rape is bucking this trend. 

BTW - where does your 60,000-90,000 figure come from?  You do know about providing sources don't you?

[Here's a source](http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/news/news-feed/police-force-figures-on-rape-made-publicly-available/) which I found.  Note that it reports a modest increase over the past five years, but it's uncertain whether this is statistically meaningful.

&gt;The number of recorded rapes, of both adults and children (under 16 years), has steadily increased since March 2008. In the last financial year (to March 2013) there were approximately 6,000 recorded rapes of children and approximately 10,000 recorded rapes of adults in England and Wales.

&gt;The numbers, of course, can never tell the full story. Increases in the numbers of rapes being recorded may mean that victims feel more confident in reporting what happened to them; or decreases may mean that victims are losing confidence in the authorities to treat them sensitively.

&gt; that this was the average figure

is disingenuous. The value of benefits to the *average* person is £300k, but only the top 25% pay that amount back. So what does the top 25% incur in 'benefits'? Is it more or less than this?

I don't think it would be too surprising if the bottom decile incurred a great deal more than £300k in their lifetime given that there is a benefit *cap*, only recently introduced, of £25k per year. That's just for the money they physically receive, not covering the universal costs of infrastructure and schooling etc. A household of two adults un- or minimally-employed with two school aged children living in London could easily rack up £300k in ten years. A middle class family on the other hand could indeed have sent their kids to private school and had private health care, never been out of work etc.

This is not withstanding the fact, which many of you may be very surprised to hear, that it doesn't take a massive amount of money to actually be in the top 25%. A household gross household income of £60k would be enough to do it.

&gt; The much touted idea that there's a rape epidemic has no evidence to support it. Statisticians have looked at the figures in the US and there's been an enormous drop in rape over the last few decades.

There were hundreds of people with all kinds of mental health issues. Several couldn't cope with being in a group that size. Lots of options were discussed and offered but really there was only one option for all but the most harmful cases. The service cannot cope and some of the workers really ought to be clients of the service. 

I benefit from it for all sorts of side reasons. For example In order to access services I have had to go into areas where a degree of agoraphobia would have me avoid. I had to walk along a road where I have had many panic attacks as it approaches my old work place. I was happy that I had to face that challenge and sailed through.

For example on a question about whether war accelerated change in Russia originally I would approach it by stating that unsuccessful wars did act as a catalyst for change while successful ones cemented the status quo. I would probably also digress into talking about how the style of war would determine the nature of the change. With this I would scrape an A. Later when I worked out how to get high marks my approach would be to divide all the major reforms of the period into economic, social and political. I would then say such and such reforms were a reaction to war, but such and such weren't. On the whole war did usually cause change in this period with the exception of WWII where reforms made during the war were rolled back after peace. This would get me an A* relatively easily.

As I said, the crime figures tend to show a drop over the last few decades in Western countries and it would be surprising if rape were bucking this trend in the UK.  

No, rape is not confined to Muslims.  However, there's every reason for me to believe that many Pakistani Muslims have different cultural standards with regards to sex and rape.  Again, and again.

No amount of rape is a good amount, but there is a world of difference between British and Pakistani sexual attitudes and freedoms granted to women.

While watching a drag show is a bitch much for me and I probably won't sit through it out of discomfort, not only do I not mind Graham, I actively seek his show out every week. It is, to me, the most entertaining late night show there is. 

I just tried to explain what I thought you may have been missing. If you think that Graham's sexuality (including how he projects it) are not an issue whatsoever, that's fine. I can see that, but I lean towards the other guy's argument.

My opinion of why the show wouldn't succeed as much is completely different:

For one, having a guest who is a comedian in every episode is a big deal. And British comedians have a certain way with open conversation that American comedians are simply not going to match. Period. 

Mix that in with the lack of drinking, the network restrictions on what Graham can bring up or talk about.

Suspended prison sentences

The court has power to impose a suspended sentence of imprisonment of up to two years.[19] The features of this sentence are:

    the offence must pass the custody threshold of being ‘so serious’
    the term of imprisonment must be between 14 days and 6 months (24 months in the Crown Court)
    the court can order the offender to undertake requirements
    the sentence can be coupled with a fine
    a supervision period can be imposed of not less than 6 months and no longer than the suspended period of the sentence or two years, whichever is the shorter
    the order may be periodically reviewed and
    the sentence will be activated if the offender fails to comply with any requirement or commits any further offence(s) during the operational period, unless there are exceptional circumstances

It is at the court's discretion to fix the period of suspension (known as the operational period), which can be for any period up to two years. If during this time, the offender does not commit any further offences, the prison sentence will not be implemented. However, in the event that the offender does re-offend during the operational period, then the sentence is 'activated' and the offender will serve the suspended sentence along with any sentence given for the new offence. A suspended sentence is usually implemented to run consecutively to a term of imprisonment imposed for the new offence.",null,0,null,1423403371,null,0,false,0,coeyarb,null,t3_2v4pkq,null,t1_coeyarb,null,t1_coewqeg,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Before the whole devolution agenda, kingdoms tended to be based on a hierarchy where a king would set the law, and then dukes, counts and barons would accept the kings sovereignty but also have their own jurisdictions with their own bylaws.

The reason parliament was so disruptive when it became sovereign is exactly that - the sovereignity of parliament. Whether you're in Cornwall, or Scotland, or Wales or England there was no (directly) meddling lords anymore (they just got to sit in the house of lords). There was one single parliament that was purely elected by the people that had *absolute* power. The people's representatives had the final say.

So today we've kind of undermined that process with devolution - whether that's a bad thing or good thing is definitely a matter for debate - but now we are back to square one with 'Scottish Laws' and 'English Laws' and 'Welsh Laws' and parliament now has lost some of that power of being able to lay down the law of what the representatives of the people think is best for the country.

I mean, how long will it be before we end up having seperate foreign policies for the different parts of the UK? ""Okay so yes there are trade sanctions against Russia but SCOTLAND didn't sign that, some public schooled Englishman in Downing Street did"".

Whereas, arguably, parliament would have to agree, INCLUDING the representatives of Scotland, what the national decision was and everyone would have to stick to it. Now they're being pressured to opt-out of that important part of the process if it doesn't primarily affect their constituents even though they are still part of the same single country, the United Kingdom.

I really don't want anyone to have to grow up feeling like they are being victimized by society. Everyone should enter into this experience feeling that they are welcomed.

People are just born like that so there's nothing you can really do about it.

But I have to have truth in order to survive I think. So I look to science to help me understand what it is.

I think if science could help us to assert facts about sexuality and gender then I feel that would calm everyone down a lot.

Then we could make some progress as a society.

But if you just force people to accept people without understanding then you will not get anywhere. Understanding comes before acceptance.

But what if you have a Christian group like this who want to return to the idea that something is wrong and needs to be cured?

Well I look at it like this: I have a disability and the idea that anyone would want to impose a cure on me as offensive.

Whatever the disability is if it is mixed with the personality then to ""cure it"" is to change someone into someone else so I don't agree with that. So I like the idea that anyone with a disability could defend each other should they go down this road.

If people can visualize and understand what something is (and this is truthful and not invented to smooth things over) then I think we'd be getting somewhere.

It's clear that people will only focus on one headline, just look at this Telegraph article. Does the Telegraph article focus at all on the more damning issues?

&gt; Maybe you think that political correctness is a good thing then. Perhaps you think it's a worthwhile trade-off? That we should ignore mentioning that 14000 girls were raped by Pakistani Muslims because to do otherwise might give UKIP one or two more percentage points?

I think we should be dealing with the rapes as a British issue, rather than one we can just attribute to one minority yes. Those 14000 girls made up under 10% of all rapes, let that sink in a moment..

&gt; Huh. Too bad for those girls that they were raped by a protected group. They really should have known that Islam is a benefit to all our lives and to doubt that is to criticize the sanctity of multiculturalism. Perhaps it would be better if they all shut up.

You know full bloody well I'm not suggesting that. Throughout this entire thread I have been criticising the police for choosing to dismiss these girls complaints. The problem is that the police weren't dismissing the complaints because the rapists were Muslim, but because of the police's negative prejudice towards the victims.

Our Holmesdale Fanatics are our attempt of creating a euro style Ultra scene at Palace. This has been fantastic for the club. At grounds in the Premier League, technically, you're not allowed to stand for long durations. Away fans are ignored when they stand because there is power in numbers defying the rules. At most grounds in the Premier League, because of seats being highly competitive to obtain, you can't really guarantee the quality of fan you will be sitting next to. This is not the case at Selhurst. The Holmesdale Fanatics (HF05) gradually bought up more and more season tickets in ""that"" corner of the ground. They now have the same defiant power in numbers attitude and essentially, power, as the away fans. In the early days of the Hf05 they were persecuted and police raids to remove fans was common. We now have this great rare position in the league where we have a mental core fan base who take great pride in supporting their community, the players, the club and often engage in fan funded displays at the games. They have a socialist element to them (which I like). They are against the greed of clubs and Premier Leagues who extort the poor with expensive tickets for their own greed. Recently their action has secured a meeting with the PL chief to discuss ticket prices. They are against modern football which is probably worth googling to get some context to what modern football is, if you have nothing historical to compare it to. 


Going back to the power that the HF05 have built themselves is because we have fans on our board (CPFC2010) that are willing to listen and accommodate the Hf05 where they can. The board don't pursue PL instructions to sit the HF05 down during games. Allowed to bring the drum to the game and wave big flags. When doing big displays across the stadium, they are given early access to the ground to get the display in place. 


Back in 2013, we went on a bad run in the Premier League. We lost 4-1 to Fulham at home. The HF05 performed a silent protest during the game at the managers lack of leadership and results. He left the club after that game. The next time they performed a silent protest was when we went 3-0 down to Southampton in December 2014. Neil Warnock was sacked after this game. I am not saying that HF05 can wave a finger and get managers sacked, but if their support is silence (unlike other clubs, we do not boo our team/players or wave flags or signs saying ""Manager Out!""), based on the last two times, the board have acted swiftly and got us a new manager. Which brings me back to my last point; because we have a board consisting of fans, they do listen to the fans. 


We love our chants as well. Start watching PalaceFanTV videos on Youtube. He records the fans at games. This isn't PalaceFanTV but yesterday a Leicester fan recorded the Palace fans and uploaded this great video: http://youtu.be/ehNaPEToA6g


When we score we cheer, then raise our hands and do jazz hands while shouting ""wooooooooaaaaaaah"" for about 30 secs to build suspense and noise. Then it kicks in with WE LOVE YOU. 

""We love you, we love you, we love you. And where you play we follow, we follow, we follow. Cos we support the palace the palace the palace and that's the way we like it, we like it, we like it... Wooooah woooaaah woooaaah""

Your CV should be geared towards the position. So, you might be waiting staff, but you have experience organising events and dealing with people, as well as taking bookings on different systems etc. As a production worker you're an excellent team-worker blah blah.

&gt; I'm afraid I can make a fool of myself at an interview, which is another reason I should spend some time living and working there before I apply for a job involving negotiating with people on the phone. 

You make it sound like Birmingham is some sort of weird place to be... I would say an interview in Birmingham will be exactly the same as an interview in Alaska. You have to be professional, project the right image (contextually, physically etc). For a first low-level job, I say don't negotiate too much. They can easily give the job to someone else if you decide you want more money. Take what they offer you initially, or if it's too low ask is there room for something a bit higher? If they say no, that's fine accept the job, if they say yes, accept the job. Then, when you have relevant experience, you have reason to negotiate. Relevant experience is very important, so sometimes you take what you can get without question.

Thing is, transfers have several, several variables to consider, for example:

- Bony has outperformed Lukaku in the Premier League over the last year and a half, so why did Lukaku go for £7 Milllion more? 

- Bony was our attack, we will not find a player like him for a long time up top, so what is our incentive to sell? 

- Does Manchester City not have an enormous transfer budget?

At the same time though, we have to consider this. Bony wanted to leave. He wants Champions League and he deserves it. Unfortunately, that ties our hands and lets City negotiate a lower price. Throw in Financial Fair Play and suddenly City can't splash the cash we expect them too, but they are the only team bidding and Bony wants to go to a big club.

To sum it all up, transfers are no perfect science. We received a fair amount of money relative to Bony's value, but the question is: did we receive a fair amount relative to his value to the club? I think most Swansea fans wanted a bit more money, but lets not forget the conditional payouts. If City manage to win a trophy the sum could increase over £30 million. Most non-Swansea fans see this as City overpaying and most Swansea fans wanted a bit more. The reality is we got an incredibly large amount of money for a player who was headed out anyway.

**TL;DR**: Winter transfers are common, but we definitely would have preferred to sell Bony in the summer. However, we can't keep him here against his will.

null,false,stax_n_stax,null,null,null,"Looking back on yesterday, I think we were good for a point. Infuriating result aside, some of Taarabt's work was worth the price of admission alone. Get him properly match fit (if possible) and the others in tune with him and who knows? As it stands a few of his passes went nowhere because the others weren't positioned to receive them. As soon as the ball is heading towards him, that's the time to anticipate what is going to happen, where you need to be and start running there.

Phillips had his best game in a while I thought. There's a decent cross in there, it's just beating his man that looks to be a problem.

I worry that Redknapp has broken Traoré. Different tasks, different positions, inconsistent selection. It saddens me because at the very least, this guy wants to be in London. His level of English is pretty indicative of how settled he is here and if only he could slot into a team unit as opposed to getting rinsed on lack of talent/confidence/match speed, we might have a nice, loyal player there. I hope the new guys don't bomb him out completely again. At least he should be here next year, and under the FFP circumstances I can see him getting a long run in the team no matter what.

Zarate looked pretty encouraging, although maybe he was just playing with a point to prove. Let's not be pessimistic though, perhaps there's a decent player in there who can ball a few goals. He certainly seemed to have the legs for it.

You just can't be lining up with Hill at leftback from the get-go. On top of being unreliable for supporting  attacking phases, he's a card risk as he is very hands-on in his defending, clawing at his man. Let's see how Yun does.

Personal opinion, but Onuoha needs a run at centreback, as he needs as much matchtime practicing being a pinball flipper as possible. Again yesterday, I thought his footwork on the ball isn't all that. Apparently he might be injured too though, so we might have superman Ferdinand to look forward to. Frankly that's a thought that terrifies me.

Based on yesterday's performance and system, I think Barton's retention over Henry is the right call. Give Fer some more time playing central, and maybe we'll have our best looking midfield for this final stretch.

In a way I think the next two matches are reasonably benign - there are scarier away matches I can think of than Sunderland and Hull. If we are going to survive, I think it has to be at the expense of Hull. Pray to your gods that Villa somehow defeat them (with an own goal?). They have a cluster of matches from Chelsea to Arsenal that might well sink their battleship. It would also be nice if Burnley stuck to the script and lost to Man U and Southampton. Leicester's next four games might see them well and truly cut adrift.

That final day of the season - Leicester vs. QPR and Villa vs. Burnley might be a heart stopper.

If we do go down, is Sherwood really the right man? Does he want a Championship gig? Given the player exodus (awesome planning from those in charge), impending fines, etc. I on no way expect to come close to bouncing back. They'd be looking at building a squad on the cheap (free signings) and within the reasonably tight confines of QPR's ordinary means. I hope it's something they are seriously thinking about - now is the time to start thinking about out of contract players who won't be wanting big money and can play within a set system. Maybe one or two promising players from Leagues One and Two. We'll be begging a loan player or two from the Premier League.

Britain is seen as a safe haven for a huge number of significantly wealthy investors in the middle east, Russia and China, and also other unstable regions of the world.

A lot of millionaires and billionaires come to the big wealth management companies and say, 

""Hello Mr XYZ Bank. My country is very unstable. I want to move my wealth somewhere safe. The UK has one of the best reputations for stability and security. How can we do it?""

The WM company responds by setting up the investor with a private company in one of these offshore centres. They then locate them a residence in London. 99% of the time this will be in Mayfair or Knightsbridge. 

It costs £1m invested in Gov bonds for an investor visa. The whole family can get one without breaking sweat. 

Now the family can base themselves in the UK, so living costs are calculated and a suitable amount of cash is put aside for the year.

Now an investor profile is made, and the remaining millions/billions are allocated for investment. Typically this means that a risk hungry profile will see more money allocated to stocks and the rest to bonds. Risk adverse means the opposite.

From my experience, most of these characters are risk adverse and while stocks invested by the WM firm are globally allocated, bond investments tend to be UK Gov and profits are reinvested and used to pay for next years living costs.

I left the sector 4 years ago and saw this process repeatedly. My ex employer is hardly a reliable proxy for entire economy but the international side of the business dwarfed the domestic.

TLDR: A significant percentage of the cash in offshore centres is completely disconnected in origin from UK but almost exclusively invested into UK Gov bonds.

The tourism argument is pretty weak, its not like the Palace of Versailles is shunned as a tourist attraction. One could even argue if there were no royals it would be more popular since you could actually go in and nose about. Also without the Royals it is pretty hard to argue that London's stature as a tourist destination would be substantially diminished, if at all.

I don't agree with OP that Liverpool looked more dangerous, besides maybe 3 attempts (one of them being that crazy shot by Ibe) they didn't produce much of anything that I saw. We were getting into their box all the time and just losing it due to a bad pass or bad touch. Yes, this was a more ""safe"" formation, favoring defense over offense, but at least he's showing us he's willing to change things around to correct mistakes. If we had lost this match in favor of a more open formation, I can fucking guarantee you that people on here would be bashing Martinez for not changing his style of play or whatever.

If you ask me, though, I'd rather take the 1 point rather than 0. Liverpool, as you said, have been looking more dangerous of late, whereas we obviously lack confidence. We ground out a draw yesterday, and I think that will work wonders on the players confidence. If we need to play like this again against Chelsea, so be it. I'm tired of losing and at least the manager is showing that he is willing to change things around to get a result.

I would note the rules are different for players under 16 where the fees are set and based upon a number of factors.

Edit:  As an example, when Creswell went from Tranmere to Ipswich after his contract ran out, the committee decided that Ipswich had to pay Tranmere £240k, additional payments of £45k when the player hit 15, 30, 45, and 60 appearances respectively, another £100k if Ipswich were promoted to the PL in 3 years, and 20% of any future profit made by the sale of the player.",null,0,null,1423412029,null,0,1423412764,0,cof18uj,null,t3_2v6rfa,null,t1_cof18uj,null,t1_cof0yrk,null,null,null,null,null,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7,null

If nothing happens, once April rolls around, get your P60, check the gross pay, check the tax and see if you are due a refund at that point.

If you are, photocopy the P60, send the original to your tax office with a letter requesting a refund and wait for a few weeks.

The problem isn't that the Scots are making too much of a fuss and demanding ever more from central government, the problem is that that English people aren't demanding autonomy for themselves. It's tiresome seeing English people complain that Westminster hands everything to the Scots; it's because they fucking asked for it!

It wasn't that I could call mum and she'd be able to stretch herself to send me a little cash to tide me over, it was that she was always on the thin line between debt or not debt.

Obviously there will be cases where people genuinely cannot provide more for their children even though they have a solid income, but it's certainly not the norm.

And the reason they're grants rather than entirely loans is a recognition that mounting debt on the shoulders of new graduates from backgrounds which cannot provide monetary support is a good way to limit their social mobility when they do enter the workforce.

I come from a non-traditional family of 8 siblings. My mum was depressed, my stepmum had to stop working because of ill health and dad was initially pushed out because he wouldn't lie to the FSA and made redundant later from a different post when the college he worked for stopped funding the course he taught.

Markovic and Borini should both be good enough to play in the FA Cup against a Bolton side who're 17th in the Championship, I don't care if Borini isn't good enough for us, he's far better than that. It's the exact situation same with Balotelli, if Bolton were a Prem side I'd agree.

I don't know what people really expect... Markovic (lesser so), Balotelli, Borini and Lambert etc haven't been given a chance in a while now, so how can they prove themselves? we have so many players in a similar situation and it's because Rodgers isn't rotating enough.

Coutinho and Lucas should definitely not be playing that many games, look at other players like Coutinho in the Prem.. I highly doubt many of them are playing as many games as Coutinho is. It just increases the chance of injury.

He should have treated the FA Cup game less importantly, we have far bigger games coming up.. Spurs, Palace, Besiktas, Southampton, Besiktas and City.. 5 of those are far more important..

iShares do seem to produce a variety of Exchange Traded Funds which can be bought in the same manner as shares, either in a conventional stockbrokers account or a stocks &amp; shares ISA (more tax advantageous)

There so seem to be limitations as to which are available through brokers though, I set up an iWeb online stockbroking account yesterday and on my first few plays with the tools, couldnt find all the iShares products available for purchase (the one I was interested in buying a few of was INDA, their MSCI India tracker fund, and this doesnt seem to be available in iWeb as of today - but others are)

Obviously ETFs and trackers reflect the overall health of the shares in the market which they cover (some actually own all the shares representatively by proportion, others use derivatives to cover the shares and reflect changes in their values)

This means if a market plunges, the fund loses value - witness the effect on BRIC (Brazil-Russia-India-China) ETF funds since various international pressures (social, political, military and economic) were applied on the Russian Federation

Cash ISA come with low interest and negligible risk of loss of capital. ETFs may earn higher rewards but the payoff is doing so at higher risk. Any ETF is a lot more balanced and diversified than any normal spread of equity shares though

Normal Stock market tracker funds can be purchased as ISAs too, instead of purchased as shares and wrapped in an ISA. ",null,0,null,1423413076,null,0,false,0,cof1p8r,null,t3_2v750d,null,t1_cof1p8r,null,t3_2v750d,null,null,null,null,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

Also, now that we have poch, the circlejerk around Van Gaal is so fucking annoying and stupid. Not sure if you guys have noticed but pochettino get very little to no credit during our wins. (Lately, he has been getting a little more credit) But ManU is all about Van Gaal. Like no one cares about the team. Pochettino is never arrogant and always credits wins to our TEAM AND OUR SUPPORTERS. Just a fucking top man.

Personally I like Birmingham because I like city living and it has good bars, clubs, restaurants, shops and it's central to the UK with great transport links - Birmingham International is a great airport and easy to get to - so it's handy for exploring the country and continent. And Birmingham Uni has a great campus. Though York is beautiful but I would probably feel claustrophobic somewhere so small for a year.

There isn't a huge amount of crime here, people are mostly friendly, there are plenty of student jobs.
The nightlife isn't great but I think it's alright for students, there always seems to be loads of them out.

Good connections by rail and coach to the rest of the country. If you enjoy the outdoors, York is roughly 30-50 minutes drive from the coast, the moors and the dales, slightly faster on the train.

The universities here are very good, York uni has a lovely campus with lakes and water birds, lots of trees and is close to shops, also about a 20 minute walk from the city centre.
We get a lot of exchange students and there are plenty of clubs you can join at the uni to help you make friends.

Essentially, a lot of people who come here fall in love with the city, it has lots of history, a lot of museums, theatres etc.

It's just overall a good place to be. When I've moved away for uni and things in the past, one of the things that always strikes me is that everywhere looks depressing when it rains and is cold.

&gt;Do players ever get traded for other players? Or is it cash transactions only?

Player trades DO happen, but outside of the MLS they are often quite complicated and rare. For example, we transfer/traded with Tottenham this summer. At the end we ended up with Siggurdsson and £10 Million and Tottenham ended up with Ben Davies and Michel Vorm. Typically trades are rare because transfers are difficult enough without throwing more variables in. If we wanted to trade for a player we would need to negotiate with 2 agents and deal with the interests of 2 players. Transfers are just more efficient normally.

&gt;How do loans work? I assume one team pays money to the other for the use of a player. This is for a whole season? Or a certain number of months? A negotiable length?

Loans can work in a variety of ways, simply put you are allowing a club to use your player for a predetermined length of time. This can range from 1 month (See our youth prospects) to 2 years! (Barcelona's Cristian Tello at Porto). Now, let's consider the 3 primary components of a loan though: wages, fees and playing time. Each is vital in negotiations. Often if the purpose is simply to get a very young player some first-team experience the key thing is playing time. Many clubs will loan away their youth for free! No fee, no entitlement to pay wages, but simply a means of getting a player experience. However more established players such as Falcao at United would require the club to pay the players wages and a monthly fee for using the player. Loans are VERY negotiable.

&gt;Also, do clubs like Swansea ever move up to champions league level? Or are they pretty much at their ceiling?

Swansea right now is completely overachieving. Given our infrastructure, location and funding it is an offence to big money clubs that we are managing to be so successful. However, replace 'Yankees' and 'Red Sox' with City and Chelsea, only more so. The money is soccer is completely uneven. The comparison would be almost to the extent of a AAA team against an MLB team. Because of this Swansea will likely never have a sustained run of Champions League qualification because we are financially DWARFED by the larger clubs. Consider Gareth Bale at Real Madrid, his transfer fee is larger than our entire First XI's current value combined. Insanity.

That said.

Football is unpredictable. Enjoy the ride. Maybe this is as good as it gets, or maybe we establish a strong youth academy and take the Southampton route to success, OR who knows a Brian Clough could appear and have us win the Champions League (Look up Brian Clough, see what he did with Nottingham Forest). We're all just along for the ride and to watch fantastic football.

&gt;I'm a fan of the Chicago Cubs, which haven't won a world series since 1908, so I won't drop Swansea for lack of championships any time soon. I'm no fair weather fan.

South Carolina Gamecocks college football fan here, I am also familiar with such misery. Cheers for staying committed. The key difference I'd have to say is that in MLB the only objective is winning the league. Relegation races, Cup matches and continental leagues arent available as other means of excitement. Swansea will likely never win the premier league, but I think we'll be able to win some cups or qualify for Europa possibly in the next decade. 

Side-Note: Check out Jack to a King and all the other great Swansea documentaries. This club was sold for £1 in 2001. We've come a LONG way.

Hope that covered everything well! Cheers!

I'm not really sure why you are saying it's out of context. He stands by it, and has done on multiple occasions.

And don't give me that bullshit. Talking about Warner Brothers, or AAA studios, that's just another way to say ""they can afford it"". And what about those who can't? Smaller companies, for example? And yes, Indie Developers would also get fucked over that way.

Trying to justify it with the fact that some people are going to do it anyway, or that the audience is going to expand, is crap. If you've not paid for it, you being part of the audience isn't going to do anything. And even with Warner Brothers, vast money they may make but it's not the same as the money they'd have legitimately earned if everyone who watched their films paid for them. 

It's very easy when you're the consumer to say ""well, they make so much money, my piracy won't make any difference"" but you have to consider it from the other side. When you're the one being ripped off, the amount of money you lose every time someone pirates your work builds up and up and up. And as time goes on, it's expected you sell your work for less, because it's old or out of date, so the profits you *are* making get less and less, and your losses increase. And then you're bankrupt, or close to it and have to give up whatever it is you're doing and do something else because you just can't afford it. 

It's like if I asked you to bake me a cake, said I'd pay for it, then ate the cake and told you to fuck off. And by the time I'd eaten it, you'd used up all your ingredients on it and couldn't buy more unless you were paid. That's what it is.

It's about time travel and is a better version of the movie. It's maybe closer to Time Tunnel than DW but I have found it pretty decent. Last Friday's episode was very timey-wimey.

It takes place on earth, between the 1980's and the 2040's so far.  It’s about creating an alternate timeline. The general theme is about using time travel to prevent the release of a virus that is wiping out most of mankind. A group in the past (our current time) and some of the immune survivors in the future (their current time) are trying to stop them.  

The main character is repeatedly sent back in time to try to stop work on / prevent the release of the virus by any means necessary.  The time machine was rebuilt (back story - it was found partially built) by a woman scientist who controls its operation (your female DW substitute for those who want it). So far there hasn't been any bad science and the paradoxes either happen or have reasonable hand waves (not a Moffat/DW bash).

There is discussion about it on /r/12monkeys but a lot of the posters there seem to like more action based sci-fi than time travel based sci-fi.

There are also the DW movies (Doctor Who – 1996 Paul McGann) and (Doctor Who and the Daleks / Dalek Invasion Earth 2150 – Peter Cushing) and An Adventure in Time and Space. Other time travel movies to consider are Looper, HG Wells The Time Machine (original and later versions are the best IMHO). Then there’s always re-watching Back to the Future and Time and Again. There are also the old TV series Time Tunnel, and some Outer Limits time travel episodes (you’ll need to Google them).


**Edit:** Project Almanac is another time travel movie has come out recently. I haven't seen it or any reviews for it. There are a lot of other time travel movies available on Amazon: A Sound of Thunder (good), Timeline (okay), The Butterfly Effect (okay but dark) and TBE II (meh), The Final Countdown, Time After Time, Deja Vu, The Time Traveler, The Philadelphia Experiment, Millennium, etc. Just remember that these, and the ones in the earlier part of the post, are not all equally good and viewing enjoyment will vary according to personal preferences.",null,0,null,1423417518,null,0,1423508156,0,cof3vfp,null,t3_2v6kio,null,t1_cof3vfp,null,t3_2v6kio,null,null,null,null,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

It's affordable, safe, has great transport links, and the city's absolutely gorgeous. The UoY's a lovely place to study, as well- although do make sure you take good note of exactly what you're letting yourself in for. 

York isn't a university you should come to if you want an exciting nightlife, grand university buildings, or a decent Students' Union. On the other hand, it's a *great* place to go if you want a community atmosphere- living in student halls (for goodness' sake, try and get somewhere on Heslington West campus- the East campus is a soulless dump) is a fun experience. The student societies scene is exceptionally active, as well. 

If you want to live in a small (but more than active enough- particularly if you're just staying for a year), historic, beautiful city with an *okay* clubbing scene (but a huge pub/bar scene), York is absolutely perfect.

Martinez also targeted Sakho by having Naismith and Lukaku mark Skrtel and Can, making us distribute the ball to Sakho, then they would all try to quickly press him into forcing an error. This should have been a clue to change, formations too. With a bit more luck, they could have pressured Sakho into making a mistake which would have led to a goal, and that's what they were banking on.

Skrtel and Can only looked so assured, because they weren't the targets of Everton's pressure, so Sakho actually did okay, not to give away anything too detrimental. 

Really what I'm saying is that game went exactly to plan for Martinez, we played the game out how he wanted it to go.

null,false,hexapodium,null,null,null,"Well, the airlines in question are quite free to take out insurance against ""extraordinary"" technical defects, and to negotiate a coverage that strikes a financially reasonable balance between price and likelihood, just like almost everyone does against costly but unlikely events. If the defects are as rare as the budget carriers claim, then it's not even going to cost them very much, in the grand scheme. That way, the airlines are protected against a risk they claim they can't control, and the insurers are in the business of absorbing risk for money. 

Rather than having a diffuse risk which they are currently trying to mitigate legally (and thus dodge out on their moral obligation to make right the people they affected by having faults), the airlines now see a direct, fixed cost and can compete on bringing that down, i.e. by proving to the insurers that they are in a lower risk pool than originally estimated, by fewer claims and agreed standards of reliability. The insurer is in a competitive market and so will be driven towards the minimum prudent premium, and the airline is in a competitive market and so will be driven towards the minimum (cost of maintenance + cost of premium). 

This sort of business liability insurance is pretty standard (the actual airframes and engines will be covered by a policy the owners take out in case of enormous, mandatory modifications or groundings, for instance, with an excess in the tens of millions and a cap in the tens of billions). There's even an argument that this sort of insurance should be *mandatory* - already we see the ATOL scheme, which is basically the same sort of insurance-against-holiday-ruination but for package tours, which is de-facto mandatory in the UK even though it's technically voluntary, as the public have been pretty comprehensively convinced, by advertising and news horror stories, not to buy a holiday that's not a participant in the scheme.

I don't think we know anything yet, and I wouldn't be surprised if we don't hear anything until Monday. 

Edit: Since we are already here, what does everyone think will happen to the lineup if Lucas is out for any extended amount of time? 

Allen came on for him yesterday, but I think most would agree that he is not a long term option at DM. Does Rodgers try to fit Allen in there or something else? 

Moving Can to DM and putting Lovren in at CB is an option which would be good because it allows us to continue with a winning formation, but it is also bad because it disrupts a successful back three as well as puts a player on the pitch who is prone to mental lapses.  

With Sturridge back, do we shift formations and attempt to play a more traditional formation with a back four and Can at DM? Maybe the 4-4-2 diamond with Ballotelli and Sturridge up front and Sterling at the tip of the diamond, or maybe Sturridge and Sterling at striker with Coutinho at the tip?  Maybe a 4-3-3 with Balotelli in the center and Sterling and Sturridge roaming around the front although that could end up with us being a bit narrow unless Sterling is mostly on the right side and Moreno is making runs on the left (which would of course leave us open for counter attacks on the left side as Moreno is higher up the pitch and we no longer have the third CB to help with this pressure).  

We have some options going forward if Lucas is out, and since this is a forum to discuss all things football, what do you guys think we would do? Personally, I think we will try out the 3-4-3 with Can as DM before moving to a different formation. I like the theory of the 4-3-3 although I am not sure how well it would work in practice. 

Edit 2: We are getting Kolo back sooner than I realized, so you can replace Lovren's name with Kolo. ",null,0,null,1423418799,null,0,1423422807,0,cof4kcl,null,t3_2v7ir8,null,t1_cof4kcl,null,t3_2v7ir8,null,null,null,null,null,22,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,22,null

in addition, you mentioned that br has buckets of money, but at the same time, you haven't taken into account inflation for good players. 2004-2005 is when you could still get a great player for 5-10m who would add to the squad. now, if you want to add a player that can make direct impact, you're looking at closer to 20m regularly. also teams were not nearly as rich as they are now, so competition for those players is higher in the prem. teams like southampton, west ham, qpr and more can all afford to buy better players b/c the premier league revenues have increased by over 100%, in just tv deals alone..

so yes while rafa had it tough, it's not like br has man city money to go out and build the squad. in addition, br had way less of a core to work with. the only players who were starting in that team that are starters now are gerrard and skrtel (and gerrard is fading). in addition, the team got blown up pretty much rodgers first year in charge. we got rid of adam, carroll and were trying to off downing and hendo. they both remained and then downing eventually left. carra retired and was old. gerrard had one of the worst injury seasons ever. so seriously? moot points. 

on your academy claim, rafa had pacheco who was ""destined to be a star""...he also had babel, ngog, plessis, i mean the list goes on. sterling was never 'expected' to be this good and suso obviously isn't with us anymore. and if he was so good, we would have moved mountains to keep him. 

so no, what i said isn't ridiculous, its the truth and everyone looks back at ""rafa's time"" as the best thing ever when in truth we played a boring as brand of footy, our players hated the manager, we won a couple trophies with a squad the houiller had built up (b/c what else did rafa win without hoiller players being the core? tell me, i don't know...)...rafa is a solid coach who performed some modern day miracles, but istanbul was all stevie at the end of the day...",null,0,null,1423419251,null,0,false,0,cof4tct,null,t3_2v366w,null,t1_cof4tct,null,t1_coe4pk5,null,null,null,null,null,-1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-1,null

If it had worked, we would be singing his praises, but based on what Lovren has shown this year, it is more likely that it wouldn't have or at least not been as effective as the back three we are currently playing with. 

Honestly, the logic behind the subs wasn't bad.

null,false,JohnMulroy,flair5,,null,"agreed. And I credit that to no one else but Poch. Hes instilled a culture in the locker room that you will have a chance and if you dont work your ass off and follow my shit you will not play. If you dont play like everyone else and play like a team you will not play. There was an ITK that came out a while ago and i think it was after the west brom defeat (how quickly sentiment can change) And basically gave them an absilute rollicking. He said that he came here to fucking win, and people who dont want to work and follow his coach will be frozen out like benny or sold. Brilliant. 


Another thing i like about poch is that everyone has had their shot. Its not like AVB or sherwood, where players were just not playing because of egos or other non performance based stuff. If you dont perform you dont play. He dropped adebayor and his own captain kaboul. Hes not afraid to do what he wants for the whole of the team and group mentality.
