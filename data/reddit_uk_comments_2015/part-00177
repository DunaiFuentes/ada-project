Locking unearned money up and preventing it circulating entrenches the social and economic power of those who have it; the idea of entrenched privilege that people haven't had to do anything to get is one of the main things liberals have been fighting against since late the nineteenth century. I wouldn't necessarily advocate rent restrictions, so much as a longer term plan to boost the stock of social and cooperative housing and ultimately allow more people to bypass the rentiers.


The Big Society was about expanding the role of charities into the state sector, to cover the Tories as they evacuated certain areas. That's very different to what I'm advocating, which is twofold. Firstly, that we should expand in the reverse direction, working out where privatisations have led to weak results (railways, where competitive markets make very little sense given one can only have one infrastructure setup, spring to mind) and looking at whether there are alternative options. Secondly, we need to think whether the standard private business setup is always optimal and whether we should have more variety in how businesses are constituted. Currently, most businesses only have a legal responsibility to a) deliver shareholder profits and b) uphold other laws. We should think about how to support and expand the role of social enterprise, and have a more diverse system in which more businesses feed their profits back into the pockets of lower-income workers, or into charitable projects, or indeed are no longer really businesses at all (for example, I'd say that between private rental companies and housing cooperatives, the latter is clearly the more liberal option).",null,0,null,1431353071,null,0,false,0,cr5hea2,null,t3_35k8m0,null,t1_cr5hea2,null,t1_cr5g36b,null,null,null,1432894558,null,3,false,LibDem,t5_2qwov,3,null

The answer is to remove the race to the bottom. Ban unpaid internships and apprenticeships[1], raise and enforce the minimum wage, ensure that all employees are treated decently and can live on what they make.

&gt; the loyalist frustration over that stand-off [Ardoyne craic] has been channelled into voter registration.    


 I agree with Mick that this will have been a cause for an increase in DUP vote, but it doesn't explain everything, as another large factor was North Belfast only having one unionist candidate. It isn't mentioned in the article, but sinn fÃ©in's number of votes in the constituency increased (see table). For the party's number of votes to go up, but the vote share to decrease, shows that something has galvanised non-registers to come out a vote more for their opposition than themselves. For me this should be an added level of concern, as their outreach is not working with what seems a large proportion of North Belfast.

&gt; In West Belfast, where Sinn FÃ©in has enjoyed Scottish Labour levels of political dominance, child poverty is second highest overall UK parliamentary constituencies.    


 This popped out at me because Mick doesn't reference this in anyway, so I went and had a little look online. I came across a [report](http://www.endchildpoverty.org.uk/images/ecp/Report_on_child_poverty_map_2014.pdf), titled 'end child poverty, which is a:

According to the Report Belfast West Constituency has a child poverty level of 32%, joint worst along with Foyle in NI. Below however is a table of the top 20 worst constituencies in the UK:

&amp;nbsp;
 
 I do agree with the point that Sinn FÃ©in are too complacent in West Belfast, but the figures used to demonstrate the point are not correct (from my limited research shown above). And it just seems a shame that incorrect statistics are being used to highlight something as, worse than it actually is. What I basically mean, is that it would have been so easy to say, the joint highest child poverty level in Northern Ireland. This is still hard hitting, but isn't blowing it out on proportion. It may seem like a small issue, but the Irish Independent is a national newspaper and should not be throwing around statements unreferenced.     

&amp;nbsp; 


TLDR;    

&gt; Up until now it has relied on cowed opposition from the SDLP, and stoking tribal fears of political unionism. But the lack of competition has ill served nationalism.    

 Great point, this is the underlying message of this article, and I think it pretty much hits the nail on the head.

At the start of the season it might have looked like we'd have a really tough time of it, but considering how poor United, and to an extent City, have been this year we should be comfortably in the CL places.

We've dropped points in games that we should have won, against ""smaller"" teams, and we've been beaten by direct rivals, and we have to get better at playing both of them.

There have been positives: I think some of the signings have undoubted talent, and more academy products are coming through, which is fantastic. Coutinho has showed just how good he can be, Henderson has improved again, Sakho has shown how good he can be, Can has looked very versatile, Moreno is a big improvement on anybody we had last year and Lallana has looked very good when fit.

Again though, we've wasted money on people we had no business buying in the first place, and overpaying on others. Balotelli was not going to work out, Lambert again was flawed reasoning from the start, and we overpaid for Lovren and Lallana.

If an MP is sent to prison, having been voted in by people who reasonably believed that they would be represented in parliament, then that's different.

In either case, what you would want to do is force a by-election (which is what happens). So you're most of the way there anyway. The only point of contention is whether you allow the convicted MP to stand (and allow the constituents to re-elect them), or not.

Moreover, an MP could do all their paperwork - and even hold Surgery in Prison. However, they *could not* vote or speak in debates.

The Commons Tellers will accept votes in-absentia if notified ahead of time, but the MP must be on the Westminster premises - if they were in a Committee session or something whilst a division was going on that they wished to participate in, then they could inform the Tellers of their wishes and be counted, but not from prison.

Your link is broken. Also, EU-born isn't really a relevant number - I imagine some of those 4.7million are UK citizens (e.g. naturalised or similar).

&gt; I'm sure there have been examples of visa rules resulting in some deportations, but rounding up 7.5% of the population of the entire country is impossible, and would be political suicide for the government that attempted it.

You're assuming that non of the 7.5% would be eligible to live in the UK after we left the EU, which probably wouldn't be the case.

IIRC, when they changed the student visa rules in 2011/2012, individuals who would be affected by the stricter rules had a grace period in which they could apply for a visa within the new system. Those that didn't apply, or were ineligible, were deported. 

I imagine that in the rare case where we do leave the EU, and don't negotiate some form of free movement deal, the same will happen. EU residents in the UK will have a grace period to reapply for the new system (which will probably include some leniency) then those who don't get it get deported.

&gt; There is no 'source' to say they won't try it, but there's equally no source that says they won't force everyone to wear size 17 purple shoes, or carry a toad in their breast pocket on Tuesdays.

When I asked for a source, I actually meant any sort of reasoning behind your comment, or were you just making it up based on how you feel it should work - perhaps you were referring to previous changes in the system where people had been grandfathered in, but apparently not.

&gt; It's simply so ridiculous as to be discounted without a second thought.

As noted you can complain to OFCOM but they will not address your specific issue on your behalf.  To tackle a specific complaint you should first exhaust the ISPs internal complaints procedure.  If you're still unhappy you can go to the [Internet Service Provider's Association](http://www.ispa.org.uk/consumers/complaints-form/) if your ISP is a member.  If they're not, or you get no joy with ISPA, then all ISPs are required by OFCOM to be a member of an approved dispute resolution service, of which there are currently 2.  Find the one that your ISP subscribes to and complain to them.

HUGE capital investment **before** these English water companies went private is one of the main reasons they're now successful. They didn't take over shoddy companies and turn them round overnight. The British government pumped vast amounts of money into them to improve the networks. Compare that to the money being pumped into NIW and IW and you will see a big difference. If either the NI or ROI governments intend to sell off their water they'd better be prepared to invest heavily in the company first.

Anyway, privatisation is not relevant to this conversation as it's not been mooted by either government and we already have a difference of opinion on enough other issues ;-)

&gt;If FG wish to come up to NI and offer fresh advice on how we can sort out our water infrastructure for the long term, that differs from the current Executive Parties response of ""stick a paper bag over our head and pretend the problem doesn't exist"" - then who I am to say that new input would be unhelpful.

Really? FG giving us advice on water infrastructure?? Do you have any idea how **bad** the infrastructure is down south? Do you have any idea how many water customers are on boil notices because of poor water quality? Parts of Roscommon have been told they won't be able to drink their water until *2017*. Jesus fucking Christ!!

Now compare that to the water quality up here. And you still think FG should be lecturing us?

FYI, The advice giving in relation to water is actually the opposite to what you're advocating. Over the last number of years Irish Water have consulted NI Water on best approaches. NIW is the more established of the two and IW are keen to to take on board *their* best practices'. They are trying to learn from us, not the other way round.

Everything you say is true for a fixed exchange rate currency. There, runs on the currency deplete fx reserves, and if it goes too far you have to go to the IMF to borrow more, all whilst you try and implement controls to defend those shrinking reserves.

For *years*, most of our history in fact, world currencies acted this way. But they don't any more. Since the 90s, the pound has been free floating.

With free floating currencies, fx reserves don't deplete when you have a ""run"". Rather, they depreciate until they find their new market rate. This has an *expansionary effect* on the economy, much the same as a larger gov't deficit. This means that much of the gov'ts stimulus has been done for it, and it can cut back. It works *in favour* of the gov't - compared to under fixed exchange rate regimes where currency runs work *against* the gov't.

Basically, since the 90s or so that the pound has been freely floating, old logic no longer applies. It's now dangerous, as it says the exact opposite of what happens under free floating currencies. *Unfortunately*, it's so engrained in economists, politicians, and the general public that we end up with these terribly misguided policies like austerity today, that's caused huge sums of damage to the economy that will never be completely undone.",null,0,null,1431353950,null,0,false,0,cr5htzk,null,t3_35ktwv,null,t1_cr5htzk,null,t1_cr5dq8r,null,null,null,1432894764,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

Second off accountants and lawyers write laws? This is news to me (and I'd imagine all of the law and accounting profession). Also capital gains tax exists and people pay it, tax avoidance is not illegal and there's a reason it isn't, because as soon as it's made illegal all those people will simply make their money elsewhere and we'll get nothing. 

Also you mention VAT and council tax? Both of these taxes bring in significantly more income from the ""rich"" and the middle than it does from the poor, generally if you're poor you're buying (or should be buying since you have little disposable income) things that are exempt from VAT and tend to pay much less council tax as this is calculated on the value of your house. Also the amount of vat and council tax paid rises in proportion to income so it's actually a fairer way of taxing the population. 

Finally your source for backing up your deluded thinking (if we're going to pretend this isn't mean insultingly I may as well take advantage) actually damages your case, the poorest 15% technically pay a higher percentage in tax than the richest 15% (a whopping 2% more) but over half of their income is benefits in kind so if we were to subtract that from their tax bill then it's much lower, especially as a large proportion of the richest 15% will never make use of the benefits they contribute to (through the use of private healthcare and education).

So in one sense it should be really easy to calculate - you take the amount we spend each year, subtract the amount we take in in taxes and various other revenue streams and there's your deficit. But there's a lot of complexities there - do you try to correct for the fact we owe debt to different countries, and the value of the pound might fluctuate? Do you ignore, count as debt, or count as income 'capital' spending (such as paying mortgages on NHS properties)? What about investment spending? Do you try to correct for 'one-off' events like the sale of Royal Mail or the sale of the Spectrum Licences? What about the *absolute* compared to the *relative* size of the debt? If you're interested in the relative size of the debt, do you count GDP or some other metric (maybe look at exports only because intra-country trade isn't relevant, maybe look at intra-country trade only because you're interested in the velocity of the economy)

I think because there are multiple ways of calculating it, politicans can be fairly safe in saying whatever they like about it. If they are called on it, they can say, ""Oh, I was using such-and-such a calculation system"", which they couldn't do if they were saying that we'd built - for example - 10,000 new tanks, or hired 10,000 new nurses (although they certainly do try, bless them).",null,0,null,1431355720,null,0,false,0,cr5irye,null,t3_35ktwv,null,t1_cr5irye,null,t1_cr5detg,null,null,null,1432895209,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

For national elections, citizenship matters a bit more, because national elections decide who gets to declare war and stuff.

Saying ""the government borrowing money is not the same as the likes of you and I borrowing money,"" is a very good distinction to make. However, I use the analogy of mortgages when explaining this to people. Mortgages are very separate in most peoples' minds from a loan or a hire purchase agreement or a debt, but in essence, that is *exactly* what a mortgage is. It's just that mortgages are (apart from at times pre financial crisis, ironically) often a very good idea, and are widely accepted, if not encouraged as the preferred route to housing. A mortgage is generally a very sensible, and very responsible act of borrowing what is actually a vast amount of money. You buy a brand new car on finance and you're borrowing Â£30k (for example), take out a mortgage and you're looking at anywhere from Â£100k up, but no-one bats an eyelid at a hundred grand mortgage (and I wish mine was that little), whereas they may look you up and down when you show up in a brand new Audi that's worth more than your annual salary.

&gt;  15.44 Breaking: Nigel Farage to remain Ukip leader

&gt; Ukip's National Executive Committee rejects Nigel Farage's resignation. Farage agrees to stay on after all.

&gt; You couldn't make it up... 

edit: Guido gives a full statement from the NEC,

&gt; As promised Nigel Farage tendered his official resignation as leader of UKIP to the NEC. This offer was unanimously rejected by the NEC members who produced overwhelmingly evidence that the UKIP membership did not want Nigel to go

&gt; The NEC also concluded that UKIPâs general election campaign had been a great success. We have fought a positive campaign with a very good manifesto and despite relentless, negative attacks and an astonishing last minute swing to the Conservatives over fear of the SNP, that in these circumstances, 4 million votes was an extraordinary achievement. On that basis Mr Farage withdrew his resignation and will remain leader of UKIP. In addition the NEC recognised that the referendum campaign has already begun this week and we need our best team to fight that campaign led by Nigel. He has therefore been persuaded by the NEC to withdraw his resignation and remains leader of UKIP.",null,0,null,1431355898,null,0,false,0,cr5ivfh,null,t3_35ln33,null,t1_cr5ivfh,null,t3_35ln33,null,null,null,1432895254,null,9,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,9,null

I agree that yes, in the event of a UK withdrawal from the EU, there would almost certainly be legal grounds for the UK to expel EU migrants.

The reality of the situation is that there would be absolutely no political impetus for that to happen, outside of the far-right. Of all the MPs now in parliament, only one could potentially advocate it, and even that is questionable - Douglas Carswell is no foaming-mouthed anti-immigration nut.

The CEOs of FTSE 100 businesses Lloyds, BG Group, Intertek, Kingfisher, London Stock Exchange, Reed Elsevier, Shell, Shire and Vodafone are all immigrants from the EU.

If foreigners are loaning the UK gov't pounds, it can only be because they like them so much they've decided to buy a few to sit on as an investment, and loaning them back to the issuer is the safest interest bearing place they can put them in the interim.

Worst case, the gov't says - you know what? We're not going to worry about balancing the books, but instead focus on building a strong economy, with jobs for every willing worker, world class infrastructure and investments in science, education, etc... and worst case, those investors decide to sell those pounds. Pounds that then come back to UK shores, doing a lot of the stimulus that the gov't would otherwise have to do.

Remember: the foreign sector saving pounds is a drain on demand. Conversely, the foreign sector *dissaving* pounds, returning them to UK citizens has a *stimulating* effect on the economy. It literally means more money for the citizens, and works *towards* the gov't's desire for a growth-orientated budget, rather than against.

The most likely scenario though is that foreigners wouldn't be overly fussed, perhaps that they'd even like the vision of a strong UK - one where growth is strong, vs [stagnant](https://i.imgur.com/Hr2RF2q.png) - and that they'd be unlikely to sell off their bonds for the growth-orientated budget. *Long-term*, growth, infrastructure, science and education all mean a *stronger* currency after all, not weaker, strengthening their investment.",null,0,null,1431356101,null,0,false,0,cr5izio,null,t3_35ktwv,null,t1_cr5izio,null,t1_cr5ircj,null,null,null,1432895308,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Not sure I follow. Are you suggesting that the BoE sets the gilt yield? I'm not talking about the BoE base rate, I'm talking about the rate that Govt pays to borrow money.

&gt;From the perspective of the UK gov't, the currency issuer, it's running up debt.
From the perspective of the UK non-gov't, ie us, it's running up savings. Every year the gov't pays us more than it taxes us, we've put aside a little bit of GBP as savings. We've paid down a little bit of our own debt. This is a good thing, and it's perfectly sustainable - the currency issuer isn't going to run out of GBP, but we can.
Trying to tax us more highly, or pay us less, is only going to result to us losing jobs and trying harder to save. And when we succeed at saving, the gov't's stuck with another deficit and all those cuts have been for nothing. All it's achieved is stalling the economy for yet another year.

You're missing some fundamental parts of the model here, which explain why such an approach is unsustainable. 

The Govt spending more than it takes in tax revenue can be seen as an economic stimulus, so you're right there. And the BoE can also print money at-will and use it to buy Govt bonds, this is exactly what we've done with QE.

But then you completely ignore a few crucial points.

1) If the BoE prints too much money, the value of the currency collapses and we end up with Zimbabwe style hyper-inflation. Prior to the recession, the BoE had never actually printed money to buy gilts before, in it's ~400 year history. Obviously with QE we did so for the first time recently, but officially that money is only temporary as I explained - we're supposed to be selling the bonds on the open market and destroying the money at some point.

2) You seem to suggest that the government can fuel growth through spending more and more itself indefinitely. This is obviously false, otherwise the ""planned economies"" of the USSR, China etc would never have fallen behind the free market, privately driven economies of the west. In reality government can increase growth long term through measures such as higher investment in education and spending on infrastructure, but that is obviously limited in scope and has diminishing returns. Ultimately growth must be driven by private sector ""innovation"" in order to be sustainable. Most economists suggest that government spending should be at least below 50% of GDP, lower the better, with less than 25% being ""optimal"". Just look at France today for an example of what happens when government spending is too high for too long.",null,0,null,1431356618,null,0,false,0,cr5j9ym,null,t3_35ktwv,null,t1_cr5j9ym,null,t1_cr5genz,null,null,null,1432895444,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,Scary_,null,null,null,"&gt;What do you actually mean by public service? Give me some examples please.

Public Service Broadcasting refers to programmes that are made for the public benefit rather than for profit. Four off the top of my head:

* Local radio is a public service, it provides information and news local to an area. When there's floods or another big incident it provides a vital service that no-one else does. Your 'local' Heart FM with it's DJ in London playing the same 20 tracks to fill the time between the adverts won't do that

* Childrens TV is a public service. Since the ban on advertising fast food to children virtually all spending on UK childrens TV production has stopped, except the BBC. If you want your child to watch TV that's not American and not with adverts, that's a public service the BBC provides

* A station like 6 Music or a service like 'BBC Introducing' is a public service. You won't get the range of music on 6 anywhere else and I don't see any other broadcaster providing an outlet for new musical talent... well except Simon Cowell if you can call that musical talent.

* Consumer programmes like You and Yours or Watchdog... Newspapers don't have the money to do consumer journalism any more, commercial TV won't touch them because they conflict with advertisers. That was also why something like Top Gear could struggle outside the BBC - they slag off Vauxhall and Vauxhall will take their money elsewhere!

Then there's religious programmes (Songs of Praise, Morning Worship etc) education (the Open University programmes like Coast), documentaries (like the current World War 1 season), minority music etc

&gt;No it doesn't. It doesn't benefit people like me who don't watch TV. It doesn't enrich my life because someone else has watched a TV programme. Arguably, occasionally a programme can be educational, but most people don't watch those programmes despite their entry level simplicity.

But they are there for them if they're tempted. A media landscape where everything is the lowest common denominator showing only programmes that will make money isn't beneficial to anyone... except the shareholders of those companies

&gt;News can be gotten elsewhere

Yes, but isn't it nice to have news that isn't influenced by commercial pressures?

That's true. They ran as the ""not-so-bad"" Tory-lite, yet still did OK outside of Scotland. I feel the biggest upset of this election was the SNP - both for their rise in Scotland and I suspect the fear of them generated in England.

This is their big issue for the future. Half the party wants to go Blair, the other half wants to go left. Thing is, there are two segments of the British population who would be happy with either of those, but not both, and it is going to be hard for Labour to steer between those segments well.

At the same time lets say the government encourages the advertising (including ones that reduce the stigma of using such services, like they have done with food banks) and referral of depressed people to mental health charities.

That would mean replacing (or modifying) every TV or radio reciever in the country

&gt;The stupidest thing about the TV licensing fee is that you are pretty much suckered into buying it if you own a television (and even if you own a pc or tablet or smart phone now) because you can't definitively say ''oh we own a tv but it's only for gaming, and I don't watch tv on my laptop'' because the license guy goes ''oh well in that case what i'll do is say you've refused to pay and you can go and protest it in court ok?''. and the BBC get all the money from it. 

That is part of the problem with it, although it has got better. Years ago the rule was that you needed a license to operate the equipment, but now it's just use it to receive live TV. So if you had a video and only watched tapes, never recording or watching TV on it they could still fine you. Now unless they caught you actually watching something live there's not much they can do

&gt;So even if I couldn't get BBC somehow and only got channel 4, I'd still have to pay the license because I'm watching live TV at all.

That's because it's not a 'BBC license' it's a 'TV license'.... when broadcasting started you needed a license to receive a radio signal as well as transmit it. Hence why it is outdated

null,false,conchobor,null,null,null,"This is an excerpt from a post I made a while back: 

Tactically, he's simply not as good as he thinks he is, and using Allardyce terminology here, he's been ""out tactic-ed"" several times this season by lesser managers of lesser clubs. Often times, his substitutions are questionable and ineffective, and sometimes, he doesn't even use them, or at least not until its too late for the subs to make a difference.

His transfers have been godawful for the most part. I simply don't trust him with money anymore. Everyone the club has brought in has been either mostly poor/average, or we massively overpaid for them, with the exception of Sturridge, Coutinho, Sakho, and Emre Can. And if the rumors are true, those were all committee signings, and not Rodgers'.

I also don't think his man management is nearly as good as people claim it is. Say what you want about Balotelli, but I think its fairly obvious that Rodgers has misused him and almost isolated him. And going back a ways here, his decision to move Agger on is highly questionable. Even further back, I still can't believe he got Nuri Sahin to come here, and then played him relatively little, out of position, and then let him leave halfway through the season. I'm sure there are other examples, but thats just a few off the top of my head.

And lastly, I think its fairly obvious he can't motivate the team at this point in the season. I think this is exacerbated by his post-game remarks. Doesn't matter how shit the team play, he thinks they played excellent and showed great character.

&gt;IMO he's in the process of developing a good footballing philosophy at the club and given a couple of more years I think he could achieve quite a bit.

What philosophy is that? He's been here three seasons now and the team still lacks an identity. Other than the new faces, where we are now is indistinguishable from where we were three years ago. Rodgers is very good at talking both Liverpool and himself up, and I think people buy into what he's saying regardless of what he's actually shown. He tries to be a Shankly, when in reality, he's closer to a Hodgson.

&gt;Surely there's something to be earned by keeping him in place rather than getting in somebody new and having to re-start the entire restructuring process again?

The ""best"" reason for *John Henry and FSG* to keep him in place is that he's a yes-man who is willing to abide by and continue their policies. Also, he seems like a relatively easy manager to work with. But as I said above, the team lacks identity and with the exception of last year, we haven't really made much progress. All the other top teams would be sacking him soon if he managed their clubs, if not already. And like /u/rydleo said, bringing in someone new doesn't mean reconstruction. A new manager may be able to get more out of the team already in place than Rodgers could.

&gt;Pounds don't come from overseas.

A nonsense. Semantic trickery. If our debt is held by a party that pays no UK tax, or is not itself, the Bank of England, then for all intents and purposes, some pounds have come from overseas.

&gt;If foreigners are loaning the UK gov't pounds, it can only be because they like them so much they've decided to buy a few to sit on as an investment, and loaning them back to the issuer is the safest interest bearing place they can put them in the interim.

Do you know how this actually works? What is it about a loan from a foreign entity that you find so unreal?

When the UK sells a gilt, and it's bought by an overseas party, how else would you conceptualise the subsequent realisation of cash in this country, if not to say that it came from abroad? Just because it's a loan, and we will almost assuredly pay it and the interest on it, off,  does not change anything about the fact that the loan came from abroad.

Anyway, I was, fairly clearly, talking about a situation in which national debt was very high, and thus, partly in need of being paid off, to avoid it reaching a level that impact confidence. The fact that this might be quite a high threshold, from an intuitive standpoint, is irrelevant, because I made it very clear that I was specifically talking about such a situation. 

&gt;The most likely scenario though is that foreigners wouldn't be overly fussed, perhaps that they'd even like the vision of a strong UK - one where growth is strong, vs stagnant - and that they'd be unlikely to sell off their bonds for the growth-orientated budget. Long-term, growth, infrastructure, science and education all mean a stronger currency after all, not weaker, strengthening their investment.

'Likely' is an irrelevant notion when I'm specifically talking about the point at which it happens. I'm saying if you get close to the point at which foreign investors become 'fussed', that's when you would be forced, finally, into paying down the national debt, assuming a strong economy.

I can see why people do it, and it's important to retain the right to do so for democracy, but I feel as a citizen my job is to assess the parties and exercise influence by voting, and participating in general public discourse to whatever extent. But once you've actually joined a party, you're backing them as if they're a football team, and tying yourself to a party line to some extent. Wanting to influence leadership elections makes some sense, but feeling that personally aligned with a political party that you want to 'fix' them also concerns me. Again, you're a citizen, they're political parties, and this is not football teams.

It borders on the problems of people who weirdly 'boast' of how they've voted for the same party for X years, 'Party X for life!' etc. It's like boasting your own lack of objectivity and willingness to address facts rather than merely follow a label. I've voted for 3 different parties in my life so far, based on local and national factors, key figures and occasionally strategic goals. I would never want to feel 'tied' to just one, and subjugate my will to the party line.

I completely understand that you might think 'if only X was in charge, this party could do some real good', so join in order to influence that - but that's not really what party membership is for, you're supposed to donate, fundraise, promote, spread awareness etc. I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that as an independent citizen. I always try to keep a step away from parties to avoid the human instinct to overly advocate for a group with which we identify in some way.

Bull. Shit. Fernandinho is arguably our best player at times, and his arrival was probably the biggest factor in Yaya having such a spectacular season which won us the league. Then there's the 25 goal contribution of Negredo. Navas was a key player in both seasons. 

It's just embarrassing to say something like that and it shows up the fact he has no knowledge or insight. Also the whole ""make Pogba the highest paid footballer in Britain"". More Bullshit. That's just stolen straight out of the Mail today - and they said highest paid ""midfielder"" - and that report was likely BS.


And also he stole the bit about the Mourinho ""I choose to work in a difficult league"" thing straight off BBC's MOTD2 Extra - the video is on the BBC website.

I also think that youth should have played a bigger part at a few times this season - Koeman states he likes bringing through youth and playing with them but hasn't done that too much. This may even be the season we have introduced the least youth players to the team for a good while. Other than Reed, and ever-so-slight bit appearances in cup or bench from McCarthy, Seager, Hesketh, we haven't seen anyone new come in.  

First season we had Ward-Prowse and Shaw come through, second we had Chambers and Gallagher, this season I think only Reed (although Targett has been around I suppose, but unlucky with Bertrand and injury). I just think at times when the squad was looking stretched and performances were dipping we maybe should have thrown someone in once or twice, give them a chance.  

That is another reason I really, really want Europe, because it means we 100% require more rotation than we've seen this season, on a more regular basis. I appreciate Koeman tried to have good cup runs, but even then he hasn't rotated enough within games at times I think. Maybe 10 minutes here and there would have done Pelle a world of good.  

Got on to a whole new rant there. My bad.

I would actually be inclined to disagree with this. It's very common practice for a fullback, isn't it, to press up on the winger in situations like that? At this time especially, we know that he's looking to put the ball into the box from there. If Jan backs up he's giving him all the space and time in the world; he has to try and disrupt the cross - which he did.

And I don't think Bentaleb was in the wrong position, either. The ""passing option into the center of the pitch"" that you refer to was the man he was tracking (I think it was Adam?) - after passing it to Whelan, he made a run towards the space behind Vertonghen. Your screenshot is the moment after he checked that run and cut back, leaving Bentaleb a step or two downfield just due to reaction time. Bentaleb was right to track it, though - leaving someone all alone in that area would be extremely dangerous.

Another thing I think is pertinent in that goal is that Fazio (and Chiriches to a lesser extent) didn't bother following the long ball back. He saw that it was over his head and kind of half-jogged into the box expecting that one of Dier or Lloris would deal with it. Which they should have, by all means. But if the pair had actually ran to back their team up, they could have been in a position to block the eventual shot.

And secondly, it's a shitty medium for long form communication. If you think they have to respond via Twitter then by default you must also agree they have to respond via Facebook, Instagram, or any other social media platform they happen to use.

If you want to get a response from your MP, send them an e-mail and upload the response. Don't shit yourselves because he said an off the cuff remark in a medium which was never designed for serious discussion.

Also the fact that the high usage is overnight suggests that this isn't something you're actively doing but rather something that is hooked into the night time supply.

You could try experimenting.  Find out when the cut over to night rate occurs. Turn off everything you know about (you may need a torch ...). If the meter is still belting along then something is clearly up - either there's something you don't know about, there's a serious fault or someone is pinching your electricity.

Meters are pretty reliable but like anything else they can fail so that's a possibility.  You could also try running a known load and see if the meter matches it (roughly).  You could also get yourself an energy monitor and see if it roughly matches - some places you can even borrow one from the council or similar.

A) American (yikes) and
B) Only been following the Premier League for two years,
but QPR's largest issues this year was too lofty of goals, no pun intended. They finished last season in the Championship disappointingly, as with the quality of team they had comparative to the rest of the league there's no reason in my opinion that they should have not been crowned champs. But they weren't. They didn't even gain auto promotion, and frankly, if Zamora doesn't net that 90' header to seal the deal, I think Derby would've won in extra time. But anyway, Harry Redknapp tried to employ a Tottenham style of football at QPR, and while it clearly benefited Charlie Austin, his back four was left hanging, due to so many men committed forward. And as a result the goals came in a flurry, and so did the losses.
Going forward, where is the state of QPR? Well, if the board stays with Ramsey and forks over the fair-play fine, in great shape. Due to being way out of market I only saw the R's twice all year, against the Champions at Loftus Road and MC at the Etihad, both defeats. But the difference in those games is when they came in the year. For 86 or so minutes, QPR had Mo and Chelsea nervous. They were flying up the pitch, making Courtois work for every euro he makes, and it was only because of the Fabregas goal that all their momentum was killed. But that QPR team wasn't the one that played yesterday against City. No, the team that hit the pitch yesterday almost appeared like they wanted to get relegated. There was no energy going forward, the back four was a revolving door, constantly spinning around to chase Aguero as he torched them.
Again, I'm not trying to bash Rangers, I'm just a tad disappointed. This was a Rangers team I thought was going to finish at best mid-table, realistically about 14 or 15. Instead with 2 games to go they'll probably finish at the foot. Ramsey will produce young talent going forward, he did wonders for Tottenham's youth academy, (my example I'm thinking of is Harry Kane) and I believe they'll be top flight soon.

Technology firms, supermarkets and so forth, for example, are all trying to outdo each other on price, quality or service. This benefits consumers. 

Meanwhile, there still needs to be social liberalism. Although the free market is great, there are public services such as the NHS which we should obviously protect. I don't think any party, regardless of political spectrum, is truly against that. However, for me at least, this includes stuff like opposing any Snooper's Charter,  fair taxation, increasing personal liberties such as medicinal cannabis, and so forth.

So if the BoE raises it's interest rate to the point where Govt bonds aren't a good investment anymore then of course the bond yield will rise. Doesn't change the fact that the bond yield is market driven and is not set by government.

The article is also fundamentally wrong:

""Why would the markets expect The Bank of England to keep short-term rates low in the future? Well remember why short-term rates became low in the first place â an attempt to stimulate a weak economy. If the market expects the UK economy to remain depressed in the future they will expect The Bank of England to keep short-term rates low. If they expect a recovery is just around the corner they will expect short-term interest rates to rise and they will demand higher long-term rates in compensation.""

Wrong. BoE sets interest rates in an attempt to maintain 2% inflation, not to try to influence growth directly. The BoE rate is expected to stay low for a long time because inflation is expected to be low for a long time, not because growth is expected to be low for a long time. For evidence, note that we grew by nearly 3% last year, but rates are still at 0.5% because inflation is still low. Conversely, growth could be shit but if there's 5% inflation the BoE will need to raise interest rates anyway.

You haven't thought it through. Whether or not the gov't performs QE/prints affects all loans and all money equally. Everyone else may default *in addition* to that perceived risk of inflation. Therefore no matter what happens, you're better off loaning pounds to the gov't than keeping those same pounds in the bank or loaning them to another householder.

Therefore, just like Japan, there'll always be a queue of people looking to loan the gov't its own money for the nominally risk-free interest it provides, irrespective of how much of that currency the gov't already owes.

No, but if the electoral system directly affects your personal life, I'd expect it to be more passionate and genuine.

Not really, since more nearly 4 million people voted for the party that got screwed, compared to less than 1.5 million voters.

null,false,DeusBex,null,null,null,"That is a very ""Orange Book"" matter, I suppose, and I'd probably classify as a pretty left-wing individual. In fact, in surveys, my ideal party is usually pretty close between the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats. However, for me, I find that the Green Party and even Labour to a lesser degree (especially Ed's recent Labour) seem quite content to demonise the wealthy. They spiel constantly about stopping the rich get richer at your expense, but I don't necessarily see it that way myself.

Whilst I don't think tax avoidance or anything of the like is acceptable, quite naturally, I do find myself somewhat agreeing with economic liberalism. We should be encouraging a strong market, as I think they did under the Coalition, because people can truly benefit under a free market where competition is encouraged. Look at any industry today, from supermarkets to technology firms, and you can see the benefit that competition has had. They're each competing to offer the best service, best quality, or cheapest prices and this simply benefits the consumer.

Where they really separate themselves from most of British politics, however, is that they're not authoritarian. The most basic example of this is the Snooper's Charter, which nearly everyone in the Liberal Democrats (regardless of economic beliefs) is opposed to. That is one of the clearest examples, as a clear intrusion of people's personal privacy, of the need for a liberal party at Westminster.

Finally, regardless of political definitions like ""liberalism"", I just find myself agreeing with a lot of their policies. For example, in my experience at least, they've been the only party to consistently mention mental health issues.

Kane's form has dropped off, which is fair because he was on the form of his life before, but we need someone who can pick up the slack when he's not performing.

This is a bit of a myth, to be honest. In order to possess quality, you need hunger and goals, both of which we sorely lacked last year.

&gt;if Zamora doesn't net that 90' header

It was actually an improbable, left foot volley!

&gt;But anyway, Harry Redknapp tried to employ a Tottenham style of football at QPR, and while it clearly benefited Charlie Austin, his back four was left hanging, due to so many men committed forward.

Not really what I saw a lot of at QPR this season to be honest. There were certainly a few occasions where we got caught on a break after a messed up set piece, we suffered from a lack of midfield attack for most of the season. ""Timed his run beautifully"" is not a phrase we've heard uttered of our midfielders in recent times. It's mainly been hoofball to Zamora.

&gt; For 86 or so minutes, QPR had Mo and Chelsea nervous. They were flying up the pitch, making Courtois work for every euro he makes

Courtois makes pounds, not euros! But I'm glad you noticed that match. We actually put up a good fight against some of the top teams, but this will all be forgotten in the wake of the 6-0 yesterday.

Their editors and ""journalists"" couldn't give a fuck if their ""facts"" (claims) stack up. As long as enough people believe them and drink their brand of Kool Aid they're a happy bunch. They're going to go into overdrive as the next general election in the Republic approaches.

There's a hell of a lot to criticise SF about, but the Irish Independent is not the place I'm going to be reading that criticism. It's a shit-rag of a newspaper.

Since the 90s, you do not *convert*. You exchange. The difference is everything.

Pre floating, you could literally take pounds and loan them to Germany, and the German gov't would accept them through the ERM.

Post float, you cannot. If you want to loan ""money"" to Germany, you need to find someone willing to buy your pounds for Euros. You then take those Euros, and loan them to Germany. (Fx markets match buyers and sellers transparently, but this is what's happening behind the scenes).

The difference is as I said. If people are loaning money to the UK gov't, they're not loaning some vague non-descript ""money"", they're loaning specifically pounds. Pounds that they have purchased, because they wanted to, and they'll be paid back in pounds. They can't ask to be paid back in any other way, that's the terms of the bond, and so really the most they can do is choose *not* to buy those pounds - leaving them in the UK - such that someone in the UK will loan them to the gov't instead.

At first I was uncomfortable with it because it seems unfair to these kids that they are essentially working almost full time and are getting paid what accounts to considerably less than minimum wage - but after around 2 years of working with an abundance of them I would say that generally speaking, these are not always people who would be a good asset to an actual paid job when they come to us - but that they do learn and I do think that they genuinely take something away with them. Even just learning to get into a work schedule of getting up in the morning, getting to work on time in a presentable manner can be a big deal to some people - something I think that I did not account for when first working with them.


At the end of the day every single placement I have had in this manner has seemed grateful and appreciative for the opportunity - and for the reference and ability to list it on their resume at the end of it. No one is forcing them to be there and for many, the opportunity to get into a schedule, to socialise with people, to learn something, and to increase their chance of getting a job in the future is worth working even if the wage is no more than unemployment benefit. Don't expect too much from them, but also don't underestimate the importance for some people to learn how to get up in the morning on time, to use public transport, to greet coworkers and learn to pay attention to instructions, all really basic things that some people need to work on.


They do take supervision and work from the staff and in the first couple of weeks they can take a lot of time out of the day (depending on what you're asking of them I suppose - for me it's animal care so we need to be absolutely sure that they understand what they're doing before allowed to get on with it) so it's not just ""free labour"", your staff do have to invest time &amp; patience into showing them what to do and helping them.

One bright spark was that Suarez was coming back immediately after winning the Copa America and wasn't taking a holiday.

11 in 19 games is good like but look what Ba and Cisse did for Newcastle after he left them. 19 games is a short spell, let's not pretend like it's a true testament of a player's ability. Charlie Austin banged them in this year for a newly promoted team, I don't think people are calling out to spend Â£35m on him.

Different era mate, you can't compare players in lower leagues or lower premier league teams to those players. Do you honestly think we'd find a Barnes, Rush or Aldridge these days?

null,false,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"You should add some info about QE &amp; the effect that has on our interest payments. QE lowers interest payments in two ways, firstly by lowering interest rates on bonds by raising demand &amp; secondly by lowering the total amount we pay in interest due to the fact that the interest payments go back to the treasury via the BoE (not the total amount, just the difference between the BoE lending rate (0.5%) &amp; the bond rate (~3% for current bond stock)). Finally the QE money pumped into the banks gets them to give out more loans (the benefit to this is debatable) which increases our GDP &amp; tax returns which further lowers government debt.

Just an initial thought from skimming the article, people usually leave this mechanism out entirely from discussion as it's not well understood. 

EDIT: Also the anti austerity argument is only in the short term &amp; *doesn't necessarily result in more debt*. Our deficit is entirely caused by our economic situation, if we return our economy to what it was before the crisis the deficit disappears. What I mean by that is in 2009/10 we saw both a massive drop in tax revenue &amp; a massive drop in GDP. We also saw a somewhat large increase in spending on welfare &amp; bailing out the banks. As an example spending increased from 40 (2008) - 45% (2009) of GDP, revenue decreased from 40% (2009) to 35% (2010). If you improve the economic system &amp; get more people in well paid work (not low paid work as is currently the case) then the welfare bill will fall without doing anything &amp; government revenue will increase. If you raise taxes on the top end revenues will increase further which again will lower our debt burden. This is another point that should be mentioned, **you can be pro austerity but not pro cuts in the same way the Tories are**. They cut the top rate of tax &amp; cut government spending at the same time meanwhile increasing VAT (disproportionately affects the poor). They're also cutting certain departments disproportionately (welfare) while leaving other departments the same or protected (healthcare) with increases in spending.

You can be anti austerity but still support fiscal responsibility in the ""good times"". Your article seems to be putting forward a view that anti austerity proponents are always for holding fiscal deficits, this is far from being the case.

In that regard, RTE needs a reality check... Unless the Coalition can reinvent itself, the next beneficiaries of the gathering implosion of the Coalition will be the political opportunists of Sinn Fein.*

But from the very second it occurs the decisions from then on in aren't going to be Northern Irish Irish people telling everyone what's going to happen.

Oh no, of course not. Violence in late capitalism is so much more well concealed and palatable than that. The middle Englanders who vote conservative won't have to see the misery that resulted from their decision, and when they do, it will be presented to them as a spectacle that reinforces their ideology (I saw an advertisement for a new series of *Benefits Street* whilst I was flicking through Channel 4's 'alternative' election night.) Everything will be private, insulated, cloaked in a veil of reasonableness. Everything will be presented as the fault of the victims, and the nice sounding bollocks of meritocracy will be trotted out, despite the fact that social mobility in Britain is incredibly low, and continues to decline year on year, and that the policies this government is implementing are absolutely *deliberately* calculated to increase socioeconomic inequality.

This, I think, cuts to the heart of it. You think (I presume you're putting yourself in the category of 'good people' who have 'worked hard' and 'earn good money') that you deserve something because you've been lucky. You can turn round and promote a politics that shits on those less fortunate than you, and expect everyone to respect you. I don't see how you can possibly, genuinely not understand why this attitude makes people not like you and those like you. It's the old saying: you've got to give respect to earn respect.

Faslane is chosen as our strategic sub base for a number of reasons. First it has unimpeded access to the Atlantic meaning if you've not tracked it before it reaches the ocean, you never will. Second because it's got around 20 miles of deep inland water (Gare Loch and the Firth of Clyde) to navigate before reaching the ocean, it can be submerged before its even left, not just territorial waters but even inland waters.

&gt;The Serious Crime Act 2007

&gt;This act replaces the common-law offence of incitement with three new statutory offences, with effect from 1 October 2008:

&gt;* Intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence: under section 44 of the Act, someone commits this offence if they engage in an activity that encourages or assists the commission of an offence; and they intend to encourage or assist in its commission.
* Encouraging or assisting an offence believing it will be committed: under section 45 of the Act, someone will commit this offence if they engage in an activity that encourages or assists the commission of an offence; and they believe that the offence will be committed and their act will encourage its commission.
* Encouraging or assisting offences believing one or more will be committed: the components for this offence under section 46 are the same as under section 45, except that the person encouraging or assisting the commission of the offences has no belief as to which specific offence will be committed (yet believes that one will be).

&gt;He's a useless motivator and horrible tactician

Who made a very smart change to a 3-4-3 system that effectively gave Liverpool a shot at CL qualification when we really, on paper, had no business doing so.

&gt;Because we had a few months of good form in the middle of the season I'm not allowed to think that anymore?

1) You're allowed to think whatever you want. But I am also allowed to (rightly) call you an idiot for doing so. 2) Is your memory so short you can't even remember last season? Getting a side to qualify for CL and nearly win the title against other sides that were deeper and cost loads more? Do you not remember Liverpool playing the best football in I don't know how many years?

&gt;So what exactly has he done well to earn more time?

As aforementioned, last season is enough to buy him more time for me. This season has been a disappointment, but to put it all on the manager is very dumb to me. You even blame him for his inability to sign players, despite there being a high-profile transfer committee in place and reputable sources mentioning he hasn't always gotten the targets he wants. But that's Rodgers's fault, I guess.

Your last points are pretty funny, because you seem to disagree, only on principle, about really astute moves he's made this year. You are upset Can, traditional a midfielder and fullback (evidently you didn't know that), has played mostly in defense this year, despite it being a huge success. You are also upset he bought Mignolet, who is in the running for the golden glove award and has been fanstastic since being recalled. 

Let's also talk about the wingers and midfielders Liverpool have that they don't need. Before this summer, Liverpool had Sterling and Ibe (who wasn't ready then to play the minutes that he has been now) in the winger department. I guess having 2 wingers is good, even though one of them would be played at ST largely this season. He added Lallana and Markovic. 2 wingers who can both play more central forward positions as well. For mids, he bought Can. 1 midfielder. Who can also cover at fullback. Now, with these transfers, Liverpool is pretty set, but certainly not last summer.

The harsh reality that you will not admit, is that the world of football has changed, and Liverpool was left behind for the last 10 or so years. Some very shrewd buys from Rafa, along with a once-in-a-generation talent in Gerrard has papered over the cracks. But Liverpool's revenues lag behind in nearly every area, and that causes the club to not be able to afford/draw the talent necessary to succeed, and success is the major factor in increasing revenues. If you think there are top class players out there that the club is just fumbling over itself in trying to get and failing, you're simply wrong. Those players won't come here. Without them, the process of becoming a consistently successful club is going to be a lot harder and longer.

But Carroll got people excited when we signed him, looking back and knowing he was injured because he fell off of a stool in a casino should have probably said everything about him tbh... but you can't deny he looked good at the time, and like a good buy if we were to do the 'big guy little guy' thing with Suarez and him.

You were using what Cisse and Ba were doing at the time to beat Carroll with.

The story in question - probably a bit of spoilers about one of my favorite Doctor Who companions ever, but nothing critical if you want to check it out

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Zygon_Who_Fell_to_Earth

It's a pretty interesting subplot, to be honest. 

[Info](#s ""8 and his companion Lucie Miller go back in time and meet her aunt long before she was born in the first place. Lucie basically tells her that she lives a pretty boring life in the future and doesn't accomplish anything of note. Her aunt eventually goes and marries a Zygon, possibly influenced by not wanting to 'do nothing with her life'. Zygon is using a body print of a guy who was comatose, therefore still alive but braindead. Her aunt is killed at the end of the story but she doesn't want to believe it because she's alive in the future, and if time was rewritten it was because of her coming back and telling her aunt about her future. The Zygon she was married to decides to take her form permanently so that Lucie doesn't have to grow up with a dead aunt. Since she's dead the Zygon can't exactly transform into her using the normal means, but is capable of permanently transforming into her without a body print machine, at the cost of never being able to turn back to its Zygon form or anything else"")",null,0,null,1431367655,null,0,1431368025,0,cr5pw54,null,t3_35m7a4,null,t1_cr5pw54,null,t1_cr5pe1y,null,null,null,1432898633,null,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1,null

Assuming they can only move in Â£3200 right now (the two current accounts) they would only be seeing ~2% interest after fees and tax, but before cashback. If it drops under Â£3,000 (say, they have to raid it for Uni expenses) they would only see a 2% pre-tax, pre-fee interest.

Also be aware you might need to hold some money in another account to make the monthly funding transfers, missing out on some of that interest or even falling below the Â£3k mark if not careful.

If you would get enough from the cashback (eg, pay enough monthly bills to providers they offer it with out of that account) and are going to keep putting money in it is likely the best option, but it's worth looking into the details and running the numbers for your situation.

Reading down that page, for the year that money is locked in the bond, and depending on how much income you are saving, a [TSB Classic Plus](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts#santander) might be worthwhile. Requires the same monthly funding, but no direct debits and pays 5% (4% after tax) on the first Â£2000.

However I am still highly suspicious of such a move because :-

1. The only reason in my mind to write a British Bill of Rights is to remove rather than add any rights, so in dealing with the issue above I think there is a real risk that you or I will loose rights in the process.

2. I feel that the current fear of Islamic Extremism is our generation's 'Red Scare,' in that there is a real threat but our fear &amp; reaction to it is overblown to the size of the actual threat. If you look back on some of the things the American's were doing during the 1950's at the height of 'McCarthyism' you can see the issue with building policy around fear - such as the US having lists of Americans who were to be detained should open hostilities break out with Russia who had never committed any crime but were deemed to hold beliefs that made them a risk (these lists included Trade Unionists &amp; then serving Senators). I feel any change in legislation or policy made in reaction to fear needs to be doubly scrutinized to avoid the risk that we give up too much in order to fight a threat we may have exaggerated.

United have been poor this season as have been City but unfortunately we've been poorer. 

So say we spent wisely instead, and got fourth ahead of Man Utd or City. And then their fans are like ""well shit, if we'd just spent more wisely in the summer we wouldn't have lost out on fourth"". So we wind the clocks back again, both of those two clubs spend better in the transfer window and beat us to the Champions League spots with inevitably better squads because they have more money to spend.  

Saying we should have spent better in the transfer window is no different to saying that we shouldn't have lost to Hull. All clubs have shitty games and all clubs have shitty transfers. The difference is that clubs like United and City can spend more to begin with so ultimately with their shitty transfers they still end up with a better squad. 40% of Â£500m is more than 40% of Â£200m, whatever way you slice it. 

Yeah, we could have bought differently but hindsight is brilliant like that. What's to say if we'd gone for the big name signings like some fans wanted and we'd instead spent our entire Â£100m on Di Maria and Falcao? We'd be utterly fucked and we'd have no hope of selling either on for anywhere near that much. Unless you're in the lucky situation of buying a player who is both talented and for some reason not wanted by the club (Coutinho) then you're always going to be at risk of either buying a dud or getting ripped off or both.

I don't want to sit here and say I didn't like the signing immediately, because I can't remember, but I know I definitely wasn't delighted or anything. 

This is all getting away from the point. The moneyball framework was the reason for signing all of these players. That's why we also tried to sign Adam on that deadline day. The system saw Carroll's headed goals and Adam's set piece delivery, and it struck up a match. The same with Henderson and Downing, they 2 of the higher totals for chance creation the season before, so they suited the system.

My original comment was that I was concerned by using stats again. This isn't an American sport like football or baseball where the moneyball system could be used more effectively. We obviously scouted those guys before signing them, but stats played a massive factor. They slotted in with the age profile, character etc. Only the Henderson transfer worked out.

Haig was human, he wasn't superman, and sometimes he made mistakes. But his career and postwar action speak of a thoughtful, intelligent, dilligent, and extremely hard working man who demonstrated a genuine compassion and concern for those under his command.

At least Haig did his bit in looking after ex-servicemen after the war by helping to found the Royal British Legion.

I never said that.

I am certain we won't with Brendan Rodgers...

We would be in the Champions League next season, with this same exact squad, same exact injuries and Rafa as our manager.

&gt;The harsh reality that you will not admit, is that the world of football has changed, and Liverpool was left behind for the last 10 or so years. Some very shrewd buys from Rafa, along with a once-in-a-generation talent in Gerrard has papered over the cracks. But Liverpool's revenues lag behind in nearly every area, and that causes the club to not be able to afford/draw the talent necessary to succeed, and success is the major factor in increasing revenues. If you think there are top class players out there that the club is just fumbling over itself in trying to get and failing, you're simply wrong. Those players won't come here. Without them, the process of becoming a consistently successful club is going to be a lot harder and longer.

Oh, I am well aware. That's why I think we ought to try and sign a manager that's actually ever won something. Because, if we can't sign good players because of the money, we ought to at least try to attract a few because of the guy leading the club.

&gt;You can expect Liverpool to win the title each year all you want, but that doesn't make you some sort of superfan. It just makes you someone with dumb as shit expectations.

I expected us to finish top 4 and be able to beat Aston Villa to reach the FA Cup final.

But I'm just nuts like that.

Your man Brendan was saying at the beginning of this season that we would be challenging for the title, then he changed it in the winter to challenging for top 4...

In my opinion, if all you have to do is search up on a website to find a quote, where it tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the quote, then learning a few that might perhaps be a little too long is more than worth learning 3 words while searching through an entire book. 

Devise ways to remember the quotes you know. Write them out and highlight buzz words. For example, in Gatsby (which I have learnt for my A level course):  
 *""In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.""*

To remember that, I know I have to remember the buzz words: **blue** (which relates to a symbol); **men and girls** (the syntax seems off, which helps me remember); **moths**; **whisperings** (I relate a flame to whisperings, which also gives me good language analysis) and **champagne**. 

I also know longer quotes;   
*""He had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, it believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself.""*

If you're wanting to get the grade then you'll be willing to put the time in.

A 3^rd is a slightly different prospect - it's not going to count towards graduate programmes, and many employers would prefer a higher classification. Having said that, you just need to work a bit harder to get to the same place. I'd recommend finding work somewhere you can work your way up. A local authority can be particularly good - start out in a non-graduate job, show that you're capable and competent, then start moving up the ladder.  Most employers would rather have someone they know and trust with a 3^rd than an unknown with a 2.2 or 2.1.

I think modern politics is far more about economics than ideology. I'm ambivalent towards the idea of a United Ireland - I don't think anything much will change.

Separation of church and state and a willingness to rejuvinate the free press would be great. And they'd need to tell me who funds and lobbies them, and who they give donations to would be great as well.   

The ability of any politician to act like a ""normal"" human being has died. A step away from the PR driven, 24 hour rolling news, I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine politics would be nice to see. And I'll not be seeing it because its really all about power and greed - not representation or ethical decison making. 

They'd have to not be career politicians - they'd have to have experience in a field of business, science, education and get into politics to do something productive because they think they can make a citizens life better rather than get paid and get their mates in on it too.

Individual policies are irrelevant because there's always going to be compromise due to funding - you know - unless they're calling for a services based economy and are participatory democrats and then they'll get my vote no matter what because they'd be the only people I'd actuall agree with on those points because its pie-in-the-sky politics at this stage.",null,0,null,1431369384,null,0,false,0,cr5qxxx,null,t3_35lv8g,null,t1_cr5qxxx,null,t1_cr5p4lv,null,null,null,1432899128,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

I'm not here to defend Martinez, but I do think that we like to forget some glaring issues that have been way too present all throughout this season.


**Distin and Barry (and Howard somewhat as well) aging faster than someone drinking from the wrong grail.**  
Holy SHIT like what happened?  The defense was just swiss cheese for a lot of this season, especially earlier.  It wasn't even bad decision making in the back for a lot of these goals, it was just getting beat plain and simple.  We've settled a lot more now (THANKS John Stones) but it's scary just HOW BAD all the other defensive options are/were.  Like Alcaraz, buddy....hang it up.

**Hey Rom and Ross - no pressure, just try to make sure you win all the games for us**  
Two young guys with the entire world on their shoulders, being asked to do what is not normally expected from guys that age.  Still, they already SHOWED this potential last year, and this year they look like decent sub options.  Lukaku is marked out of every game, and is useless if he isn't running forward already when he gets the ball.  Ross can't make a decision, and seems overwhelmed, so he panics and tries all sorts of fancy moves and shots to no avail.  I worry that Ross's cerebral abilities are less than adequate (and I know there's the perception he's not the most...intellectual).  Attacking midfielder is a creative thinker's position, and I just don't think he has that in him.

**You get an injury!  And YOU get an injury!  Everyone gets injuries!**

I personally believe the injury that Ross got at the beginning of this season is a big reason why his game is so off.  But way too many other guys are having hamstring, metatarsal, ""knocks"", etc.  It's like only Jagielka is someone I can actually count on to most likely be in the game every week.  You could just see so many times when a pass went the wrong way that these guys just don't play enough together week in and week out.  There's no rhythm - it's just following a game plan blindly without any level of improvisation.  

I really do think a huge part of improving for next season is going to be the mental game.  Really cleaning out the bad residue of this season, just letting it go, and starting over (Coleman pretty much said this in an article).  Oh, and also getting rid of people like Gibson, Alcaraz, Distin, and some other guys.

That said, I didn't feel at the time we'd struggle as much as we did for the first few months. I felt we had a team capable of fourth, and that it was a pretty reasonable plan that we'd add depth, maintain a fairly young core to the squad with the aim of really hitting peaks in two or three years, and hope to cling onto CL spots until then. 

I wasn't expecting us to ever be challenging for the title, but then once Chelsea got Costa I don't think there was a plausible transfer window that would ever see us up there. Likewise with Arsenal now having a strong squad and City being better on paper than they turned out this season, 4th seemed like the best we were ever going to get anyway unless we kept Suarez. 

I feel the downfall of our transfer window was probably more driven by the assumption that Sturridge would be fit for at least some point of the season and that Man Utd maybe wouldn't rebound quite so hard as they did - the club probably figured we'd have a bit more time to build in youth than we did. With hindsight and knowing how those two things turned out we'd probably have spent differently, but again that's hindsight. 

To be honest I still don't feel we're all that fucked. We could do with a few good transfers this window but I also think the squad is going to increase substantially in value every year just from the fact that most of our first team is under 24 and those players are only going to get better over the next few years.

cl was a joke, admittedly...br and this young squads first forray into the competition. i think ludogorets wasn't a gimme game given how much of a run they gave madrid and basel. basel is never a gimme game for epl teams...ask chelsea... and EL? in a time when we were challenging for the top 4 and were really in the hunt with a congested fixture list...i don't mind our exit. we did not lose a match, we simply lost a penalty kick coin toss. hardly embarrassing. 

semi final loss by villa? yeah that stings and maybe a match we should have won...but put it in perspective, we reached the semi final and this game came at a time when we were still missing key players, and probably down in form. think about who villa beat to get there and the form they are currently in. they are absolutely on fire right now. i loathe the fact that we gave up a 1-0 early lead, but i am not upset by the run in the cup. 

and the ""we're 5th"" trophy that was talked about above? we haven't finished 5th since 04-05, you know when we won the champions league. since 2009-2010 season, our best finish was last year at second. outside of that, we hadn't finished higher than 6th. I don't know about you, but that is a clear upwards trend. 

also on the note that you slate our 13 match, not 12, unbeaten run, yes fans are excited by that. that is the SECOND seasn in a row where we went unbeaten in a lengthy spell of matches. against lower level sides at that. teams that we have sturggled to beat the past few years. while im not saying that there isn't a lot to be critical of, because i can get critical, we should take the postives out of the season and figure out how to build on that. this negative, blow shit up approach from fans is counter productive. yes, you want to see results now. yes, you want top 4. yes, this was a great year to achieve that. no, we didn't achieve that. no, we don't have the power and pull that those teams do. but yes, we are still liverpool. but yes we are still the 8th most valuable team. but yes we are ranked by forbes as a ""super six"" team. but yes we have 50m from kit sponsors new balance, 30m from standarad charter, 100m coming from tv renue, and many young players moving up and dead wood moving out for good fees. there is a lot to be happy about...so get your complaining out now because once this summer rolls around things are going to happen.

Capoue and Stambouli (in theory) could do this job, but they're both crap. With the way we play, the fullbacks bomb forward, leaving just two in the back to cover any counter. Apply a little pressure to the two guys, and bad pass, goal. 

If, on the other hand, we could get a CM who actually is capable of doing what Poch wants him to do (Schneiderlin is the most obvious example), we could release our fullbacks and trust that the CBs have a clear outlet and support.

What I'd also do is replace either Lamela or Chadli (probably Chadli) with a winger who can track back and stays wide. The way things are now, our wingers tend to cut in and push up, which leaves our fullbacks as the only players capable of providing width.

The Lib Dems complained repeatedly. As did a huge proportion of the electorate to the point at which FPTP was completely unthinkable in the formation of the Scottish parliament.
So yes, people did complain when Labour was in power, at least a quarter of the population, in fact.
Furthermore, because proportional voting would have resulted in a SDP/Labour coalition for the entire of the 80s it was repeatedly in the Labour manifesto.
They also formed numerous commissions into voter reform after the 1997 general election; the prime example being the Jenkins cross party commission.

Only the Conservative party have consistently been opposed to *any* form of voter reform. Alternative vote was selected by their party in 2010 as a carrot for the Lib Dems *specifically* because the Jenkins report ruled it out. In fact, the Jenkins commission on voter reform specifically ruled out the need for AV given that it wouldn't have represented a significant change in proportionality. The Tories knew exactly what they were doing when they blocked even AV+ from being in the referendum. 

Fear, private propaganda and a dodgy voting system keep regressive political parties in office. We will not have a free, representative, democracy until these issues are solved.

Silly as it looks, kids with PTSD (such as former child prostitutes and former child-soldiers) thrive when they practice TM and Yogic Flying (part of the TM-Sidhis techniques).

This is why Father Gabriel Mejia (nominated for the 2000 Nobel Peace Prize) uses TM and Yogic Flying in all 60 of his orphanages, and names it part of ""Los tres pilares fundamentales de Hogares Claret"" -one of the 3 fundamental pillars of his program:

Depending on what qualifications you already have from Denmark might be able to use them to get into A-levels or University. You should contact Universities and/or colleges and see what they need for you to get in, also visit www.ucas.com. 

Overall, GCSE don't make a difference at all when you actually go to University, all they do really is help you a little bit during A-levels, where the grades you get there will decide which University you go to. 

Sixth-forms and colleges are generally for A-level, not GCSE, but I'm sure this depends on the place, once again it's worth getting in contact with places you're considering going to.

As for GCSE subjects, it doesn't really matter, doing Business Studies will help but it doesn't matter too much if you don't. I know people at my University doing Business Management without even taking it at GCSE OR A-level. What you do should just depend on what you enjoy and are good at, and what the school offers.

No idea about any colleges or anything in NW London I'm afraid.

We've heard Labour's MPs blaming both the SNP and Cameron's method of handling the SNP as the reason for Labour losing in Scotland. They can't accept that they lost the UK vote because they were the weakest party in this election. The tories absolutely dominated in ex-Lib Dem seats that were marginal, AND somehow dominated in Wales. If you break it down country by country Labour were the losing party in *all* of the United Kingdoms. SNP beat them in Scotland, Plaid beat them in Wales, Conservatives beat them in Englnad, N.Irish Parties did what they always do.

It shows that the party still can't come to terms with The People having voted for SNP. It's like they think SNP somehow stole the vote. 

The Right did do a good job of it - and Labour should have too. Milliband could have very easily pointed out that SNP's nickname used to be Tartan Tories, and the only government they were ever a part of was a Tory one. I can't see how Milliband - and the entire Labour Party - didn't have an answer to The Scotland Issue. It's like every time it was brought up they wanted to pretend it away.

That's just complete conjecture and I'd say rose-tinting things. I love Rafa, but we had plenty of similarly lacklustre seasons under him in the league. Even if you blame the 7th place finish on G&amp;H rather than Rafa, we still only finished in the top two once, and that was in an era before Man City had money and when we were still spending relatively big as a club. Really the worst we could expect would be 3rd or 4th because we were miles ahead of the rest of the table, and most seasons that's what we got with Rafa. 

&gt;I expected us to finish top 4 and be able to beat Aston Villa to reach the FA Cup final.

Except you'd also presumably expect Man City to beat Middlesbrough and Chelsea to beat Bradford and then there's a decent chance we're not playing Villa at all (or we're just lucky that the four clubs better than us all end up in the other half of the draw). And either way you'd probably expect us to lose to Arsenal in the final so who actually cares we still wouldn't have a trophy. 

The whole appeal and point of knock-out cups is that any team can in theory win on the day and you can't just expect that you'll beat sides worse than you. You can't have dodgy Liverpool squads beating Barcelona and AC Milan in the Champions League and cry foul when Villa pull the same kind of upset on us. That's how teams like Wigan and Pompey win trophies every now and then. And at least Villa are a PL side - I've watched Liverpool crash out of cups to far worse opposition than that. 

&gt;Your man Brendan was saying at the beginning of this season that we would be challenging for the title, then he changed it in the winter to challenging for top 4...

And Rafa consistently did the same thing most seasons as well. So does Wenger. So does basically any manager at a top club, because the last thing you're going to say at the start of a season is ""don't bother lads, we've got no chance of winning this"". And when we're mid-table in January he's hardly going to be bringing the title up as still being our core target.  

Rodgers talks a ton of shit to the press, that's part of his job. I can't really think of a manager who doesn't - some (Mourinho, Wenger) are better than others (Hodgson, Moyes), but they all do it. You can't just assume that everything he says is what he 100% believes to be the truth because it's obvious most of the time it isn't, but the only other option involves being crucified by the media.

I agree there, but remember that Sturridge won't be properly fit and available for the first 1-2 months of the season. Plus Origi will be a 20 year old new to the country. I think he'll be higher in the pecking order than you think.

This is what I meant to ask for specifics on. What makes him not good enough in your opinion?

&gt;10 goals in 30+ matches, he's lucky if he gets 10 matches for us. You do the math. 

Again, for a side that only scored 27 as a whole. We've scored 50 so far this season and doing the math puts him at around 18 league goals if he plays 30+ matches. So even if he were limited to 10 matches (which I don't believe would be the case) he should get at least 6. That's only the league games as well.

I advise minimal toiletries, and stock up at Aldi or Lidl, BUT do pack at least one 'luxury item' each for a smell of home.

Furnished rooms are much cheaper than unfurnished, but you have fewer rights. The most common sort of let is called an Assured Shorthold Tenancy, and you sign a contract with the landlord. It is usually for six months. The terms of the contract should be pretty clear. Without a contract, you are vulnerable. Almost no British people will rent without a contract, but a lot of foreign workers get tricked into 'word of mouth' renting. Having a room you pay money for but no contract is a sign you're being ripped off.

The same goes for your job. There should be a very clear contract. No contract means you're working illegally. The sort of people who hire illegal workers can be very unpleasant.

Aldi or Lidl are also where you're going to go for food. There isn't much choice, but it is so much cheaper than anywhere else that it's a no-brainer. Two people can live on about Â£50 a week for food. 

How much your rent is depends on where you are living. Â£600 is not a lot for rent for two people for a month, to be honest, and it makes me worry about what rooms you are going to be able to get, as most places want a month's deposit as well as the first month's rent. Without a reference, I would personally be expecting to pay the full six month's rent in advance. It makes me worry about the room your friend is going to get you.

I think managers are shying away due to the ambiguity of the situation. Nobody will know West Ham's intentions moving forward until they have spoken with Sam at the end of the season. I think some managers think he'll get a new contract if he gets us to 50 points, which is entirely possible given the two opponents we've yet to play.

I don't think we can necessarily believe a manager or his agent when they say they aren't interested at this point. Allardyce getting ""snubbed"" (which is a point of conjecture, nothing more) at the awards dinner isn't enough proof for a potential manager to throw their hat into the mix and ruin their chances of landing a job elsewhere/risk souring their relationship with their current club.

There is nothing to do at this point but wait. We won't know anything until the year ends. If we win our last two and finish in 9th with 53 points, I would not be shocked if Sam got a new deal. But given our current run of form I think it much more likely we lose one and draw one, finishing 10th or more likely 11th on 48, but still making Europa via Fair Play. That will leave the ownership with a difficult decision.

* The GFA didn't end the conflict, it just moved it away from violence towards politics. The disagreements which are at the heart of the conflict (specifically the whole united Ireland question) were left unanswered. The GFA has allowed the conflict to take place between politicians in Stormont instead of paramilitaries on the street. 

* The two positions are literally the opposite of each other. One group wants to remain in the UK, the other wants to create a united Ireland. How can you bring those two groups together and give them both something that they would be happy with? 

* It's only been 17 years. We've been at the other's throat for hundreds of years now. We're just coming out of decades of bombings and shootings. That burden of thousands of lives and hundreds of years can't just be erased by some abstract agreement in only a few years. 

* The two communities exist so close to each other, but live so far away. I grew up without sectarianism: my parents were and are disgusted by it in all forms and Catholics had married into my family without a problem. Yet, outside of those in my family, I was never true friends with any Catholics until I started college. It wasn't that I was trying to avoid them, it's just I could live my life without ever spending time with at least one. The thing is I don't think that's very unusual. We play different sports, go to different schools, join different clubs. For many people their understanding of the other community comes from rumour, allegations and opinions from within their own.

But you call him a 'shinnerbot', even though he wasn't defending them. He then provides a link to illustrate his argument in their journalism; something you seem to criticize. Here, I really have to disagree with you. I would argue that, the best thing to do when debating is provide material for why you have this opinion. By doing this, people can develop their understanding of the issue, and decide for themselves how credible the source is, and if this new information changes or reinforces their opinions. To be completely honest, I would love to see more of this on the subreddit. I personally feel it would improve the quality of discussions here, even possibly calming some threads down a little.

You could be right, they may have been threatened or seen horrible things, but I don't believe this is an excuse for bad journalism. As I have referenced above, the chairman is a ex politician for Fianna FÃ¡il, so this would be a more logical reason for constant attacks on sinn fÃ©in. This [chart](https://politicalreformireland.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ipi_longitudinal.png) from Trinty Collage Dublin, dated 27/03/2015, shows that Sinn Fein are the third largest party, ahead of Fianna Fail [source](https://politicalreformireland.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/ipi_longitudinal.png). For me, this information shows that Fianna FÃ¡il, (who don't forget are the 'republican party' and were formed when De Valera left Sinn FÃ©in) have a good reason to try and show the party in a bad light. It only helps that one of their old politicians is the chairman of the biggest selling daily newspaper in Ireland, again a [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland#Daily_newspapers).

People on the right tend to be more keen on stopping things from happening in the first place than looking after the criminals.

That is bollocks.  Societal factors play a role but so do peoples choices.  

I see nothing wrong with the minimum wage.  I see nothing wrong with lots of reasonable laws that help people out and up.  The thing I reject is the elevation of helping people to the idea of it being someone 'right.'  I have no problem with the state providing housing for people that need it.

That definitely implies that Suarez is the key to CL, in my opinion. Maybe I misread your argument, but I think, at best, it was unclear.

I'd love to see you show me how more than a hand full of managers in the world can attract talent due to themselves and not their clubs. Right now, I can think of maybe 5 managers who are draws for players: Mourinho, Guardiola, Wenger, Ancelotti, maybe LVG. I think we, as fans, grossly overestimate how important a manager is to getting players. Even the heavenly Klopp didn't draw players based on his own name.

I don't recall BR saying we'd be challenging for the title, maybe he said we hope to, or something to that effect. In any case, I don't gauge expectations on what the manager says--half the time that's a half-assed attempt at motivating players.

I think the major diversion here comes in that I am holding the players accountable for their performances, FSG and the transfer committee accountable for their purchases (or lack of purchases), BR responsible for his team selection, tactics and substitutions.

Well, you can't deny there isn't a significant link between Murdoch's backing and results. Given that the British  public are on the whole ""[wrong about nearly everything](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-public-wrong-about-nearly-everything-survey-shows-8697821.html)"" you have to question where misinformation is coming from; Murdoch's news outlets will feature significantly in that list.

The young tend to vote left; we have a significantly lesser stake in the status quo as older voters.

Pretty much the entire ""obvious"" point of the article is that there isn't much we can easily do. 

Like, what do you actually suggest we do differently? All the other clubs around us are competing for the same players, negotiating with the same clubs over fees, and trying to bring them into the same league. And they're doing that with more money, more attractive squads, and more promise of trophies than we can offer. This idea of ""we just need to be better/more efficient"" can apply just as equally to the clubs around us as it does to us. 

We can't just spend Â£200m in a single transfer window to get back into the top four like Man Utd can. That's fundamentally not an option to us. We do that, the best case scenario is we get into the Champions League by horribly failing FFP and have to take whatever punishment that entails for a few seasons, hoping we can still be there when they tail off. The worst case scenario is we *still* don't get into the Champions League and we thoroughly pull a Leeds, lose our good players on the cheap, and end up in administration. 

Compared to that, to be honest, I'm kind of OK being where we are and hoping for seasons like last season to come around as often as possible, and that we can slowly grow our way up and wait for one of the current top four to slip. Beats financial collapse and successive relegations any day. 

Am I happy that it's our place? Would I rather have our squad than a squad like Chelsea's? Of course not, and I don't expect anyone else to, but just because we don't like it doesn't mean we can change how things are. It's not about whether you want to accept our place in the league, Tomkins' entire point is that it, objectively, it *is* our place. We're not some special little snowflake of a club, we have no reason to expect that our scouting network and transfer selections will magically punch above our weight. 

You can't leave school with some shit A-Levels, fail to get into uni, be pissed off that big companies won't already hire you on the spot for Â£50k a year, and just decide that you'll get that job anyway because you're not happy to settle for working at McDonalds. The club has what it has - we can't compete with big money for big players, so we're going down the NVQ route of buying cheap young players and hoping that after several years of hard work we can maybe grind our way up to eventually be back on that level, as Arsenal are starting to reach now - after around ten patient years of doing so.

null,false,listyraesder,null,null,null,"One of the core values of the BBC (and importantly a condition of its charter) is that it represent the interests of all British broadcasters, and nurture the commercial sector, while being a good neighbour to its competitors, seeking to raise the bar rather than put anyone out of business.

In this way, it has to weigh service proposals against commercial harm - one of the barriers to opening the whole BBC archive as an iPlayer-type service is that it'll flood the market which independent producers and ITV rely on for income.

The BBC also racks up huge bills in research and development, which is often later shared with the other companies or open-sourced outright. Sky and ITV are the only others capable of such work in the UK, but the BBC has world-class research - it is currently re-writing the technical specifications and requirements for the entire European Broadcasting Union because of its trusted status and track-record.

Commercial radio learnt from the BBC's experience with web streaming. ITV, Sky, Channel 4 and Arqiva are co-owners of Freeview with the BBC. The corporation attracts attention and talent from around the world which is then reflected back onto the other companies.

BBC Training offers courses and training facilities for production personnel and management, and it is utilised by the BBC themselves, and also ITV, independent producers, and freelancers. British talent and crew get run through the mill too: Radio 4 alone commissions more annual hours of new drama than any other organisation in film, radio, theatre or television in the world. This means more experienced writers, directors, cast, crew, producers. Just by making so much content it creates people who can create so much content. And, because the BBC pays civil-service wages, ITV, Sky or the indies can just pluck nice ripe talent from the vine.

Then there's the simple gravitational pull of the BBC. It is one of the most admired brands around the world, and is associated with quality - even our schlock is well-done schlock. This raises the profile of british talent, products and formats. ITV is now one of the world's biggest TV producers, making shows around the world largely due to an appetite for British formats fostered by the BBC. Buyers from around the world come to the UK because of the sheer concentration of product at the BBC, and while here they look at ITV and the indies. Sherlock does well, but there's only so much Sherlock, so they'll buy up some Lewis as well, and you know Doctor Who does well so let's buy the entire run of Primeval...

They get all the benefits of having the world's biggest broadcaster in the same fox-hole as them, but they don't have to compete with it. In fact, by taking up 48% of the broadcast audience, the BBC is making a 30-second commercial even more valuable and precious.

There are real problems in going up against the BBC, but ITV and Channel 4 define their identities in relation to the BBC's. Channel 4 is Auntie's rascal nephew, while ITV is her glamorous sister.",null,0,null,1431373293,null,0,1431374004,1,cr5tdvc,null,t3_35kwz9,null,t1_cr5tdvc,null,t1_cr5ryw5,null,null,null,1432900349,null,28,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,28,null

Of the ex-Lib Dem seats, 27 went Tory and 12 went Labour - with the rest going SNP. I am not sure how many went SNP, but I feel the SNP part + Labour part would be about equal to the Tory group (i.e. all the Scottish Lib Dem seats). In other words, I think it was a roughly even spill out from the Lib Dems to the right AND left, but it just so happened the left was divided.

Also, in England 8 Labour seats went Tory but 9 Tory seats went Labour. So Labour wasn't really trounced in England either - just did not a ""ok-ish"" job, which in reality wasn't enough. 

With that said, Labour *should* have done better than they did in England. You could say they ""held their ground"", but given the cut-happy government they really should have done better, so that was for sure a failure. 

&gt; The fundamental reason they lost the election was that they either didn't see SNP coming, or didn't prepare for it. Anyone with 1/2 a brain could see what Cameron was doing the day after the Referendum by consolidating his Middle England ""English Votes for English People"" suggestion.

Welfare cuts are inevitable when reducing the amount of money the country is spending. This article fails to mention all the people raised out of poverty by increasing the personal allowances, another thing they intend to do again.

No, I do not agree with the Snooper's Charter.

Zero hour contracts aren't as bad as everyone makes them out to be. Not to mention the last major overhaul of them was with the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. This was not a problem created by the conservatives. Of course companies are going to seek low cost employment options when they are not making as much money. Also research [would suggest that most people are satisfied on zero hour contracts.](http://www.cipd.co.uk/pressoffice/press-releases/cipd-research-zero-hours-contracts-unfairly-demonised-oversimplified-261113.aspx) 

Food banks are a sad reality of welfare cuts but in order to get the country in a better shape financially, they are a necessary evil.

I believe public spending should be reduced, as should taxes, so yes I agree in tax breaks for millionaires.

It's pretty obvious labour only brought this in to irritate the upper classes. I'm more concerned about animal slaughter methods than fox hunting.

Debt is the integral of deficit. The deficit was huge, now less so.

Repeatedly demonstrated to be beneficial by any person who actually has an understanding of international treaties, law and economics.

&gt; Zero Hours

Claiming everyone who has a zero hours contract is struggling to live is ridiculous.

1 million food bank uses does not equal 1 million different people using food banks

Not only is this number practically a rounding error on the national budget, but these tax cuts were not ""for millionaries who donated to the conservative government"". They were for anyone who pays tax in the top income tax brackets and that consists of many people who aren't even millionaires.

If the Dave's are simply running the same gambit as last year, then this time around it has become very problematic and it may well backfire on them. Last year the players stood by Sam so it was relatively simple to let him keep gig. This season up until recently they had been making the right noise about sticking to Sam. But considering Sam's body language on the side lines over the past few weeks and some of the stories that have been creeping out about players distancing themselves from him, and I'm getting a little worried about the reality of the club's cohesiveness. There isn't a reboot button that automatically erases any accrued cynicism and resentment as soon as he signs a new contract. And, if that negativity has contributed to the severe fall in form of many of these players, it does not mean that when they return next season they automatically revert to the good form they displayed for the first half of the season. Some of these players will not come all the way back from the depths they have fallen, and I fear because of that we will now need to bring in more players than we would have had this team regained some semblance of their previous good form. At any rate, for all the good business sense the Dave's have demonstrated during their tenure, I do think their policy on end of season manager contract reviews, while consistent, has had a negative affect on the club and supporters.

The press is owned by large corporations, and is anything but free, journalism is restricted to the opinions of a small circle of oligarchs like Murdoch. The electorate is indeed one check, but it is fickle and unreliable. Manipulating huge segments of the population, misinforming them and keeping them uneducated is very easy to do for an unrestricted government.

I do have empathy for the victims, of course. But I don't believe that giving them vengeance against their transgressors is right, or that it helps solve anything other than a primal, animalistic urge. The best way to stop criminal activities isn't to create draconian deterrents, but to try and alleviate poverty and give them a genuine chance at rehabilitation. Look at Nordic prisons - they have amazing living standards, and an incredibly low recidivism rate.

What you seem to be saying is that people do need help in certain situations, and your only real counter-argument seems to be abuse. But that isn't an argument against human rights! Having a right does not, of course, give you the right to abuse the welfare state, and you *can* have inalienable human rights, *ensuring* that the most vulnerable aren't left to rot, while tightening checks and verifications. 

I'm not sure what you mean with the last paragraph. Am I against an EU referendum?

I'm originally from Upstate NY. I say ""New York,"" and people assume New York City. Where I'm from is rolling hills and valleys with lots of cows; the city I'm from has a population of about 12,000. That being said, the Wirral countryside or even Northern Wales wouldn't be too much of a shock for me. Though, it is important for me to have things like fast dependable internet and the ability to go shopping without driving too far. 

I've lived in Palm Beach, Florida, Bar Harbor, Maine, and now I live in Eugene, Oregon. This means I've lived in some pretty diverse places -- all with very different regional cultures and people. I like to think that I'm pretty open for anything when it comes to where I live. 

I'll be taking a job with a good salary. My employer will be paying for my first month accommodations and a car rental. I assume I will be purchasing a used car when I'm there. As an American, I'm not used to having public transit, and although I appreciate that you guys have a very impressive system, I can't live without the freedom of being able to hop in the car and drive. 

Liverpool looks amazing. There is so much right at your fingertips. I'm worried that the daily commute would be bothersome, even if I would be going opposite of the majority of traffic. 

A lot of people in this thread are recommending the Wirral as a good choice. Its a short drive to Liverpool, Chester, and Ellesmere port. I haven't been finding a lot of rentals, though. Liverpool seems to have a lot of modern flats and at reasonable prices. For lack of knowing a better option, I've been looking on Right Move. Perhaps there is a better option?

Thank you again for all your comments and advice. There is some great information here!

From Wikipedia:

&gt; *For most of its history, the Irish Independent (also called simply the Independent or, more colloquially, the Indo) was seen as a nationalist, Catholic, anti-Communist, newspaper,[6] which gave its political allegiance to the Pro-Treaty party Cumann na nGaedheal and later its successor party, Fine Gael.[6] During the Spanish Civil War, the Irish Independent's coverage was strongly pro-Franco; the paper criticized the De Valera government for not intervening on behalf of the Spanish Nationalists.[7]*

&gt; *In the 1970s, it was taken over by former Heinz chairman Tony O'Reilly. Under his leadership, it became a more populist, market liberal newspaperâpopulist on social issues, but economically right-wing. By the mid-nineties its allegiance to Fine Gael had ended. In the 1997 general election, it endorsed Fianna FÃ¡il under a front page editorial, entitled ""It's Payback Time"". While it suggested its headline referred to the fact that the election offered a chance to ""pay back"" politicians for their failings, its opponents suggested that the ""payback"" actually referred to its chance to get revenge for the refusal of the Rainbow Coalition to award the company a mobile phone licence.[8]*

Since we're on /r/northernireland, it's also worth mentioning that the Irish Independent was, in its official editorial stance, opposed to the Good Friday Agreement back in the 90s and early 00s.

Like you, I tend to get my news from a range of international sources. However, for Irish news The Irish Times can be good in parts, and although it's overlooked (since it was a Cork-based paper for most of its life) The Irish Examiner occasionally has some good political coverage and reasonably decent analysis.

null,false,basketballhater,newcr-1,Besic's new Lambo,null,"Let me start off by saying I'm no fan of Martinez. 

That being said, I do think that some of the things you said are a bit unfair. First of all, don't ever compare Howard to De Gea. He's arguably going to be one of the best keepers the world has ever seen and he's just in another class compared to Howard. We don't have the money to afford anyone near his abilities so blaming all the goals on Howard's mistakes is a bit unfair. 

Secondly, I think you absolutely can use Europa as an excuse. Moyes may have fared better, but this competition is taxing nonetheless and especially under Martinezs style which requires a lot of player and ball movement. Moyes had more of a static play style that focused on long balls and defending well. It's just another style of play and this one (Martinezs) requires a bit more depth to be successful. 

Thirdly, I know lukaku hasn't scored in way too long but he's providing for other players to score because most defenses are too concerned about lukaku to mark our other threats properly (case and point is mirallas goal against United). He opens other players up and I think that is an invaluable asset. On top of that the guy is very young still and I think he has done more than enough to prove he's a great player for his age. 

Lastly, I don't think anyone from either the fans or the organizational standpoint is considering this season a success. I'm pretty sure what everyone means by saying that we'll be successful if we get top 10 is that it'd be a massive improvement from where we were just a month ago, hovering above the relegation zone. They're counting this as a success in the manner that we can try and use these results (though they have been unfavorable since united) to help set us up mentally for next year. 

I absolutely agree that this season has nothing but infuriating but there's no real point in dwelling on it.

A lot of its original and adapated drama's are great.  Just last week ""the C word"" received almost universal praise. Not all of it will be to your taste, but some of it may be. Their funding for British film is also pretty important. 

Some of its comedy offerings are great, the thick of it was spectacular, Charlie brookers offerings are often very very good, HIGNFY is perhaps something of a tiring series but still fantastic, its showcasing of live comedy, and smaller acts is to be commended, its commissioning of new series that have launched careers of mega stars also needs recognition. 

It's nature programming is fantastic. Are you seriously telling me you wouldn't miss shows like planet earth, Africa and blue planet ?

Radio 4 is some of the finest broadcasting in the world. In fact it also commissions more new comedy and drama than pretty much any other media outlet. 

Radio 1 isn't aimed at you, but there are a lot of people that still like it. 

Radio 3 gives a genuine outlet to classical music (and the culture and history surrounding it) that just wouldn't exist on any other platform. 

radio 2 is pretty good for an easy listening experience, I accept that a mixture of absolute radio, xfm, the arrow and heart could perhaps replace a lot of it, but its still pretty good. Although you would lose out on some of the jazz and soul and country music that it plays from time to time. 

test match special would struggle to be aired on any other platform.

I could go on but I think you perhaps get the jist.

What credibility would Ukip have in the Commons if others had to enunciate party policy in Parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest?

So it seems that he has now decided that he will indeed brief Ukip policy from his local. Or, at least, he would have decided that, if he had ever thought that he might not be briefing Ukip policy at all.

But he never thought that. Ukip went from nothing to a force to be reckoned with under Farage's leadership.

I can see where people are coming from when they say they don't think we'll ever win titles under Rodgers, but I think he showed last season and for Jan-March this season that he can put decent runs of form together and really that should be enough for top four. Which should be our main priority over the next several seasons.

No it isn't rigidly position based, it all depends where the players are. You aren't excluded if you're a striker but you've dropped deeper (Gomez might do this for Fiorentina, he drops in behind, wide men come in and push from the front).

Eriksen just went to press him, it's in the gif.

&gt;and is goal side of the player is meant to track him.

You don't just let him go if you're in a better position. ""Oh well he's goal side I guess I don't have to do anything"". Did you just stop running back or something and not mark players? If you can sprint up one end of the pitch you can make your way back and track your runner.

&gt;Id love to see how the marking scheme which you envisage

Quite simple really. Eriksen tracks him seeing as he's in a more advantageous position, Mason drops in behind/slightly more centrally. I have done a lovely diagram for you. Imagine there's about 40 yards in between the two:

So the size of the majority is pretty much always twice the number of seats that a winning party is over the finish line. 

This may seem counter intuitive but think about the maths of it: the conservatives have 331 seats out of 650. That means that all the other parties combined including the speaker, could only muster 650-331=319 votes against the government. That means that in a vote where all conservatives voted for something and every other MP voted against, they would win with a majority of 331 - 319 = 12 votes.

In practice their majority for any given vote will be larger than that because the speaker and deputies don't vote, Sinn Fein don't take their seats, and there are some MPs on the opposition benches who will likely support the Conservatives on a number of measures (DUP, UKIP). However, it would also only take a small number of Conservative MPs to rebel for the government to lose a vote, because every time a Conservative MP votes against the government, it cuts that majority by two (one less for the government AND one more for the opposition). It will be interesting to see how effectively Cameron can keep his backbenchers in check on contentious issues.

null,false,Chlorophilia,null,null,null,"&gt;The cost of solar has been plummeting for a while now, the argument subsequently it should receive any form of subsidy is weakening as it approaches the same price per kilowatt hour as coal and natural gas.

It's not really a weakening argument though, given that fossil fuels - despite their low price - are actually highly subsidised in the UK (and of course, there are massive subsidies for oil exploration). On the topic of solar power, there are two important considerations. Firstly, it is not yet as cheap as coal and natural gas. According to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#United_Kingdom_.282010.29), even in Germany (which has some of the cheapest solar energy in Europe), the gap between solar power and fossil fuels hasn't been closed yet. Only the very bottom end of the cost range reaches into the range expected for coal. The second consideration is that solar energy isn't particularly widespread in the UK and since it's in our interest to increase our use of renewables, it's also in our interest to have generous subsidies to encourage people to invest in solar power. Generous schemes allowing communities to build their own solar PV farms (thus allowing them to remain in control of their power rather than allowing energy corporations to siphon off money) are behind the huge success of solar PVs in Germany.

&gt;if you want the private sector to build and maintain renewables

That's one of the massive advantages of renewable energy, specifically forms like solar PVs. They don't necessarily have to be under the control of the private sector. Half of all solar PV energy in Germany is community owned which is part of the appeal - if communities own the energy generation rather than large MNCs, it's more cost effective for them in the end because all of the money is going to the benefit of the community rather than towards shareholders.",null,0,null,1431378292,null,0,false,0,cr5wlgb,null,t3_35ll2y,null,t1_cr5wlgb,null,t1_cr5nb5w,null,null,null,1432901861,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

What do you mean by this exactly? 

My old flat in Manchester was heated by electric storage heaters. These used night-time electricity and let their heat out during the day. The place felt cold as a fridge but they still gobbled up the electric.

Do you have gas central heating at all? Do you have a gas water heater? If either of those are heated with electric then your bills are going to be high even though they are ""rarely used"".

The big electric guzzlers are the heaters, including washing machine (hot washes), tumble dryer, kettle, hob and oven.

The next biggest are the things that are on all the time e.g. fridge, pc.

&gt;In [political theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_theory), the __Overton window__ is the range of ideas the public will accept. According to the theory, an idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within that window, rather than on politicians' individual preferences.  It is named for its originator, [Joseph P. Overton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Overton) (1960â2003),  a former vice president of the [Mackinac Center for Public Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackinac_Center_for_Public_Policy).  At any given moment, the ""window"" includes a range of policies considered politically acceptable in the current climate of public opinion, which a politician can recommend without being considered too extreme to gain or keep public office.

I'm not suggesting feeding him for christ sake. Guess what, Dier's the RB, I guess Faz shouldn't move across to get the man then? He shouldn't need helping out. 

http://i.imgur.com/NEi9nRm.png

Oh wait, Dier's 40 yards up the field, I guess he needs helping out. 

&gt;if hes so positionally clueless that he needs our number 10 to sprint 60 yards backward to fill his position that he just vacated and didnt bother to recover, then well you are kind of proving my point.

Did you seriously not watch your gif? Faz is going to hold him up. Either Eriksen gets him and passes him on to Faz or he waits for Dier to double team, Mason drops into the middle, Bentaleb taking Adam, Mason a bit in front of Vlad. Christ you're not even looking at Dier's positioning either. N'zonzi's clearly in Dier's spot and he's clearly not bothering to recover, why aren't you lambasting Dier?

&gt;You have a very strange outlook on football whereby it is our number tens obligation to track the oppositions box-to-box midfielder.

I didn't say it's the #10s job did I? I'm saying that in this position, Eriksen is in arguably the better position to track him. It turns out in a dynamic game like football sometimes people further up the field need to get back and *gasp* maybe even make tackles.",null,0,null,1431379167,null,0,false,0,cr5x4r9,null,t3_35mpuv,null,t1_cr5x4r9,null,t1_cr5woon,null,null,null,1432902114,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

The first part is your opinion and also means that all the campaigns to ban fox hunting had nothing to do with the law being passed. This is also the slaughter of animals in one of the most awful ways possible. The foxes get literally ripped apart by dogs while still alive, how is that humane if you care about slaughter methods? 

**Snoopers charter**

Why are so many human rights groups against this then? Also as we have seen from the snowden leaks and other cases we know this does not stop the law from being abused and contain loopholes. It also puts everyone's personal information in the hands of our government which has shown time and time again it cannot be trusted with peoples data from leaks and data breaches in the past.

**TTIP**

Again why are so many human rights groups and parties across the world vigorously fighting this? You also completely glossed over the fact that this gives corporations power over our governments to sue them in secret courts behind closed doors off the record. How can you not understand the implications of this, how is this beneficial to anyone other than corporations?

**Zero Hours**

700,000 people especially from deprived areas are well known to struggle on these contracts, this has been reported on many times. Also how is not knowing whether you will have money to live off each week beneficial for anyone? 

**Food banks**

Also from the same site: 913,138 people received three daysâ emergency food from Trussell Trust foodbanks in 2013-14 compared to 346,992 in 2012-13. I think this shows things are rapidly getting worse and this is a growing problem.

**Cuts to public services**

You think cutting vital services to the NHS, closing fire stations and cutting down the police force is a good thing? Lets hope your house does not set on fire and they can't make it on time because they closed your local fire station. Or you die on a waiting bed in hospital after a bad accident because there are not enough beds or doctors and nurses to attend to you in time.

**Human rights act**

So how is dropping an act that has been in place for over 60+ years and has shown to protect peoples basic human rights a good idea? How can we trust politicians with our basic human rights when they have shown many times in the past to abuse them and try to remove them from us?

**Fracking**

Ha your just trolling now but i will state the facts for other people. There have been many cases where people have sued the oil and gas industry and won because of the damage it has done to their health, local environment, water supply and breathable air. Tests have also scientifically shown that the chemicals used are highly carcinogenic and have also damaged the health of workers on the gas fields. Do you also not want to address the issues of global warming with the amount of methane being released from the fracking process?

**Using RT as a source**

There are many other sources and news outlets which have reported on the exact same thing, do a search and take your pick.

As someone mentioned it does, usually, tend to produce strong governments and sideline extremists. This is more evident in a two-party system where it allows a party to govern but it can break down when the vote share to spread out.

One of the biggest advantages though is that it has a strong link between you and your MP. Each MP is reasonable for their consistency. A lot of PR systems assign seats from a pre-selected list based on the popular vote share in the country or a region. So the politicians aren't indvidually accountable to a specific electorate. You also have a clear point of contact for issues you may have and people forget that an MP will deal with cases from their constituency. 

The fact you elect an MP rather than select a party (in theory) also means that single-issue candidates or popular locals could run for office. Caroline Lucas for Brighton might be an example. Carswell is a really popular MP locally which is why he could defect to UKIP without risk of losing his seat. Generally PR, as they require a sizeable chunk of the population to vote for you, prevent independents from running too.

Edit: The ROI channels come from Black mountain or Carnmoney Hill. The signal is apparently weak than of that which comes from Divis. So try point your aerial towards black mountain. The channels should appear as 51,52,53. If you pick up the Soarview (I do with a Â£30 indoor aerial) they may appear in the 800's. If you have no luck after the rescan, try giving them a call 03456 505050 ([Pricing](http://www.freeview.co.uk/articles/faq/more-about-freeview/about-freeview/what-does-it-cost-to-call-the-freeview-tv-advice-line.html))

&amp;nbsp;

If you had the channels before, you can have them again. It must be some sort of aerial/signal issue, as I check the specs of your tv and you can 100% pick up the signal from black mountain. Sorry I couldn't help more.

I'm not using the fact that Mason sucks at tracking runners as a valid excuse. I'm using it as evidence that he's basically being played out of position, but that any idiot can see he's in the best position to track N'Zonzi. 

I actually don't even know what to tell you if you think Eriksen is the one who should be coming back from the opposite side of a player to run him down. Mason is undisciplined here. He has a good position on N'Zonzi but halfheartedly presses him and then ends up in no man's land, and then makes little effort to run him down. You do one thing or the other...either you fucking stay tight to him and try to win the ball or foul his ass, or you stand off him and read the game.

Any bill is properly scrutinised and I am confident, when the text of this bill is published, it will not threaten our hard won freedoms.

Regardless of whether that is true, there are plenty of people on the right who do not see it that way. 

Take a simple(ish) issue such as grammar schools. The left maintain grammar schools harm social mobility; the right maintain the opposite. No doubt appropriate googling would yield studies that support both sides.

The point is that whether or not grammar schools do or do not harm social mobility, both sides care about the fate of the poor. Both sides support their viewpoint by claiming that their system benefits the poor the most.

Now, some people undoubtedly vote with their wallets. Perhaps such behaviour is more common on the right. But most people want to believe they are not selfish. Most people want to believe their vote makes the country a better place.

As it stand now your parents are almost certainly secure tenants having a local authority tenancy, if they move into a housing association property they will lose this tenancy and most like be given either an assured tenancy, flexible tenancy or affordable tenancy.

If they move and are given an assured tenancy then they will most likely most with some ""protected"" characteristics so they will retain right to buy qualifying time. What you must double check and be certain beyond any doubt is that this will be the case.

If they move and are given a flexible tenancy, be aware that the housing association may decide to review this after 5 years (most seem to be looking at 5 years as far as I can tell) at this point they may decide that your parents do not need social housing and go for possession. Given the circumstances this wouldn't seem very fair but it's a London borough council we're talking about...

Registered providers are going to fight right to buy for their homes every step of the way. If they're successful, you parents may have given up a lot of money and security for no gain. HA tenants have right to acquire but the discount is only a fraction of what you would get through right to buy. My firm advice would be to wait and see what happens for now and then be absolutely certain what type of tenancy they are getting when they move and that if possible they will be able to buy the property.

null,false,jetpacksforall,null,null,null,"Way late to this discussion, but IMO the main problem with Keynes is that ""countercyclical spending"" is also counterintuitive, cerebral, and it runs counter to the NIMBY priorities of most electorates. 

Here's what I mean. In a down economy, voters are generally hurting. They might be unemployed, they might be facing cutbacks, they might be watching investments turn into worthless paper. The rich are canceling vacations and third home purchases, and the poor are facing destitution. In that environment, the idea of the government spending money becomes offensive. The assumption is that the spending will come out of taxes, and taxes are already turning little into nothing, taking a resented bite out of disposable income. Borrowing also seems profligate, because what private individual in their right mind borrows money when facing ruin? 

On the other hand, up on the top side of the cycle, Keynes recommends austerity, reining in spending so as to prevent overheating the economy, speculative frenzy, asset bubbles, etc. But this is also offensive on an instinctive level. Why put on the brakes when things are good? Why unwind debts when borrowing is so cheap? An austerity government in boom economies is treated more or less exactly like a bear analyst in a bull market: like a shriveled up old doomsayer beset by silly paranoias, risk aversion and fundamental moral cowardice.

Flooding prevention schemes will take some water away from an area, but it's the type of flooding which is important. Is it an overflowing river? Is it tidal flooding? Is it sheer number of houses and not enough waterways? Some types of flooding have more effective prevention than others.

The final important question is whether the house has been built to accommodate flooding? More often now, homes which suffer from flooding can be built with inbuilt defences, such as water gates on the doors, tiling floors up the walls and installing electrical outlets at waist level or higher.

There are American orcs and dwarves, Warcraft and Disney's adaption of Snow White are two examples that come to mind.  What I can't imagine is giving them a distinctive regional accent.

Although... maybe a Southern gentleman voice would be appropriate for elves in some settings...

I think you are right that what one's accustomed to makes a difference.  When I first started watching more British media, it felt a little jarring to hear a character from a non-European culture with a British accent, but I barely notice when it's an American accent.

&gt;But the Queen's Latin trope annoys me, my accent isn't something of a bygone age, it's just normal. 

That's what I'd expect.  But even British media does it.  Games Workshop is a British company, and their settings are full of fantasy creatures that speak with specific regional British accents.  They've even [stated outright that the races are based on British subcultures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWvAznIRVLA&amp;t=2m52s).

null,false,Aedta,null,null,null,"Sounds like a Traineeship placement, kind of like a pre-apprenticeship/job preparation scheme. This company will be the training provider and should do some basic training with them including functional skills, employability skills etc. for about three weeks in a classroom setting before they come to you. This is Entry Level/Level 1 stuff though, basics. Usually the promise is just a guaranteed interview at the end of it, for an *opportunity* to start an apprenticeship or job- rare to see the apprenticeship guaranteed. It's for young people with very low qualifications (probably no GCSEs) and won't be paid, though if they're claiming benefits they can retain them. 

It's supposed to offer that first step on the ladder for young people who literally have nothing else going on and no qualifications, but I've no idea how successful it really is. It's certainly profitable for the training providers though, who are paid by the number of young people they get through it. Lots of money is available for this sort of thing now because the participation age has been increased to 18, which means that even if not in school/sixth form/college young people are supposed to be engaged in some form of education or training, which this counts as. 

On the whole I'd be a bit sceptical due to the unpaid work required, and I do perceive a bit of exploitation by the training providers that run them. Many will just shovel as many young people through as possible, doing the bare minimum to hit their targets and then claim for the outcomes. They do try and find work experience placements with different companies but most will have a fall back like a local supermarket or warehouse where they can put anyone spare, which takes the piss a bit. Consequently it's also ripe for exploitation by unscrupulous companies who'll work in cahoots with these providers to get easy access to free labour. 

If you have an entry level opening it'd probably be better to skip this and go straight down the apprenticeship route, but pay what you feel is fair rather than apprentice minimum wage. There are are a range of providers out there too, don't just go for who comes knocking first. If you do have someone on work experience/traineeship however they don't have to finish the full programme before you take them on, which would be much better for them and you can use it to your advantage too as a free recruitment tool.

When somebody is struggling on a low income and can't afford the rent to put a roof over the heads of their children, you can't just chuck them out onto the street. When somebody with a disability can't look after themselves without a carer, you can't just cut their benefits, then cut the carers allowance, then cut incentives for businesses to take on disabled workers and then expect them to look for work when they clearly aren't able to.

The fox hunting ban was (and is) very popular in urban areas which is where Labour has most of it's support. In turn the Tories have traditionally had the rural vote where the fox hunting ban was (and is) extremely unpopular and thus Cameron can now curry favour with them by putting it up for a free vote.  

Pro-fox hunting activists regularly tout the idea of that everyone who is anti-fox hunting is a townie who doesn't know anything about the foxes or hunting or the countryside just as anti-fox hunting activists claim that everyone who is pro-fox hunting is a rabid bloodthirsty toff.

------------------------------------------------

Manchester City's representatives have flown to Turin in order to hold talks with midfielder Paul Pogba.

City's cortÃ¨ge arrived in the Italian city with the intention of enticing the Juventus superstar to the Etihad this summer.

The Italian giants are driving a hard bargain, with the club determined to keep hold of their prized possession pricing the 22 year old at â¬100M.

However it isn't only the sheik's shekels that are on the table as: PSG, Real Madrid and former club Manchester United are all reportedly keen on acquiring his talents. 

Club captain and team-mate Andrea Pirlo has quashed any rumours of Pogba joining city's cross town rivals stating:

""Whatever the future is for him I don't see it being Manchester United. He didn't feel he was treated well there. I know that was under Sir Alex Ferguson and now there is a new coach, but I do not seeing him returning to a club where he was not treated well.â

Whether Pogba ends up donning sky blue is yet to be seen, but  wherever he ends up he is certain to be a huge asset after netting ten times already this season for la Vecchia Signora.

No, the Labour party first introduced private providers into the NHS on its formation, following demands from GPs to be able to maintain their own practices.

Can we stop the new reddit maymay where people name a logical fallacy and pretend that invalidates the previous post? That wasn't a strawman argument in the least. 

&gt;Would you take a vegan seriously who opposed fox hunting?

That depends on the vegan's reasons for doing so, doesn't it?

&gt;meat and eggs serve a purpose as food.

So do tofu, quorn and xantham. The consumption of animal products is not necessary for human survival, it's a luxury that most afford themselves because they derive pleasure from it. 

 &gt;Leather is a material to make things out of.

So are cotton, polyester or linen; they're also cheaper than animal-derived alternatives such as wool, leather or silk. You can get by just as well without wearing them.

&gt;Pills are a form of medicine.

That could be just as easily tested on willing human subjects.

&gt;The animals who suffered/died to make those things weren't but through that solely for someone's enjoyment.

Nor are the foxes, they die in order to keep the population under control. There is a purpose to fox hunting, but there is no purpose to using animal derived products. You consume them as a luxury without giving a damn about their origins, fox hunts kill foxes for a reason whilst making the hunt enjoyable.

&gt;If it's about killing the fox rather than the enjoyment of the hunt, then shoot the fox.

Looking at your posts I can easily understand now why you think he's ""racist"" but by that method of judgement I'm also a racist.

Take that quote for instance: ""Any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door."". You used that as clear cut example of why farage is racist. You probably think it's incredibly prejudiced, bigoted and racist. Personally I think of Romania's crime problems, the gypsy population that live there, the fact that they have the lowest economic well-being in Europe. Replace 'Romanian' with 'Pakistani' and consider the state of that country or the police commissioner who said ""the majority of perpetrators of pedo rings tend to be of Pakistani descent"" or the fact that it is largely under shariah law.

Nigel is saying fair-minded people have the right to be concerned who our neighbors are, is that really racism? Sure it is making judgement about people before we even know them but that's just the hard truth - people who grow up in shit hole countries where it is normal to abuse women and commit crime won't suddenly change when because they moved to a better country.

His comparison with Germany has nothing to do with his wife, it has to do with the fact that Germany is a country with equal standing to our own.

With QE, the objective is to promote economic growth through money generation. This is achieved by the central bank promoting liquidity (i.e. encourage trading) by buying assets from commercial banks. The trading of these assets reduces their yield (i.e. interest rate or rate of return). This in turn encourages investors to adjust their portfolios to achieve a greater yield. This results in greater trading and liquidity, which promotes lending and money creation.

With debt monetization, the government issues/sells new government bonds to a third party, who then sells it on to the central bank. The money generated by the sale is then used to finance government spending.

The principle difference between the two is that QE is seen as a reversible process. Once the positive effects have been observed, the central bank will sell the assets it originally bought.

Try using Zoopla as well as Rightmove. There's a lot of overlap, but you can sometimes find some properties from smaller letting agents or landlords on there that aren't listed elsewhere.

It might also be worth your while posting a request for recommendations on which companies people think are reputable. We have the occasional shitty letting agent, so it might help you weed out your final choices in a few weeks!

If you're looking at exterior photos online, particularly in Liverpool, don't be fooled by old-looking frontages! There's a fair few old buildings that have been totally gutted and renovated on the inside, while keeping their 100 gear old exteriors. There are also a fair few older houses in the suburbs of Liverpool and Wirral that have been significantly renovated: insulated, re-roofed, plumbed and wired.

If you just prefer modern, that's fine, but don't rule out slightly older places on principle. Every house or flat must advertise an energy and thermal efficiency rating by law, so you can compare what your heating bills are likely to be.

They do this all the time on the BBC. Pay attention to the narrative sequence and you'll see the same sequences repeated again and again.

Report disclosures that are critical of the establishment. Cut to reassurance from authority figure.  Return to piece. repeat  

They do it again at 2:45 where their presenter characterises the story as ""highly embarrassing"" and then again repeats nearly the same wording of character reference as Alan Webb supplied. ""most experienced"",  ""highly respected"", ""embarrassing""

The narrative tells you what to think at every opportunity. They repeat it to make sure you have the right opinion.

The fact is that the police know that these kinds of actions are highly illegal. Not embarrassing. Illegal. It's not just a sacking offence for just that officer but for whoever created the policy. But they've done this for decades. There's no doubt about the incitement laws. they understand the law very clearly. Considering this was done back in the 80s to the miners, and in every decade since to various protesters, its simply has to be an undisclosed government policy to do this and so the police have to make it happen. Or perhaps they cooperate with the undercover guys who are brought in from the intelligence services. Disrupting protests is part of government policy along with controlling the message on the media.

The news report is just to blur the picture and paint it as a rogue action. The police chief is the one on the stand, he's the focus of the story. If further evidence came out then if would be just him that would be in ""hot water"". The policy came from the politicians and are probably based on plausible deniability. 

Even if the scandal exploded you would see him 'sacked' and then within a year or 2 he'd be given another role. 

We saw this stuff played out again and again during the Scottish independence referendum. There were mass protests outside BBC scotland which were initially unreported. Social media and the internet are eroding their ability to keep a lid on these things because an increasing proportion of the population dont get all their news from the mainstream media. Especially young people.

We didnt have the internet when I was a kid. None of this was possible back then. Its no wonder they're trying to put 'controls' on the internet as well.

null,false,duckwantbread,eng-essex,Essex,null,"That YouTube video has jumped to a conclusion based off circumstantial evidence, worse they have missed a vital clue that gives pretty good reason to believe those 2 guys did not provoke a fight, but were in fact trying to stop one. 

I think those 2 guys probably are undercover policemen (which isn't a shock, we know those are used in large scale protests), but the video tries to portray them as 2 people starting a fight to provoke a riot. Looking at 0:28 however we can see a man wearing a black sleeveless jacket with a white long sleeved shirt underneath at the right of the screen run in the same direction a second before these two men ran there. (Edit: I've highlighted this in the image [here](http://imgur.com/tanfa9j), video quality isn't great so it's a bit blurry, look out for the man in the video to see it properly).

 If they were the ones that started the fight why did this 3rd person also run in? I think much more likely these two men noticed that a fight was about to kick off and ran in to stop it (notice that a man in a white hoodie starts being pulled back by one of them, this man is completely obscured by the crowd before he is pulled back so we have no idea what he was doing prior to the intervention, he could very well have been starting a fight). There is no explanation for why the 3rd man (who could not see the 2 men claimed by the video to be provocateurs) would have run over before the two accused men unless something was already happening before they got there, hence they did not start the fight.

The next part of the video doesn't tell us much, it shows a plain clothes officer jump over the police barrier to assist with an arrest, as I said plain clothes officers are often used in protests so this isn't shocking, it's perfectly legal so long as they don't incite riots or anything like that. The video also claims the two men from earlier are part of that arrest, although it's hard to tell since it's so blurry. Either way as I said I don't think they started any violence and I think they tried to stop some breaking out so there's no problem there. 

The last set of phrases is just confusing, it seems to suggest that people chanting 'fuck the police' is proof that the peaceful protesters have somehow become angry because they've discovered a secret police provocateur. I'm not sure how the author of the video reached that conclusion, even if he is right how did the whole crowd discover this officer? Much more likely someone started chanting fuck the police because there were police standing behind the barrier and then everyone else followed suit.

Edit: Person that downvoted me, please give me an explanation for why the 3rd guy reacted to a fight that hadn't started yet (if you go by the video's narrative)?

null,false,TheMania,null,null,null,"&gt; Are you suggesting that the BoE sets the gilt yield? I'm not talking about the BoE base rate

The BoE directly does for short term gilts, and indirectly for long term.

This is because loaning pounds to the UK gov't is nominally risk-free, assuming you reason that the gov't would sooner print than default. This is a reasonable assumption to make, as to default, wiping billions off bank balance sheets, would destroy the entire financial sector and take the economy down with it. It'd make the GFC look like but a blip.

There's just no reasonable scenario where banks can *borrow pounds* for 0% interest, but be unwilling to loan them to the gov't for 1% interest. It'd literally be free money to them.

&gt;If the BoE prints too much money, the value of the currency collapses and we end up with Zimbabwe style hyper-inflation.

That's not true. QE, even when being performed at many times the rate the government's actually deficit spending, has been struggling to reach even the *minimum* inflation target - let alone hyperinflation.

Zimbabwe specifically was not buying ZWD denominated bonds with ZWD. They were buying up the supply curve of USD, tanking the value of the currency on fx markets. They're two *very* different forms of ""printing"". One has the capacity to be hyperinflationary, the other struggles to be even inflationary.

Weimar was similar, only with gold in place of USD. They owed gold, they printed papiermarks to buy gold - more than the economy could produce - and tanked their currency in the process.

This is *very* different to printing pounds to buy pound denominated assets (QE).

&gt; You seem to suggest that the government can fuel growth through spending more and more itself indefinitely. 

Or equivalently, lowering taxes. All I'm saying is that if a higher deficit would lead to a better running economy, if we were to ignore concerns that ""maybe this deficit's the one where the gov't runs out of pounds"" that keeps us from running them, then we ought run that deficit. As the gov'ts not going to run out of pounds.

&gt; Ultimately growth must be driven by private sector ""innovation"" in order to be sustainable.

A balanced budget/surplus is where the gov'ts taxing more for any given level of expenditure, meaning that there's less spending the private sector can perform, less goods/services that can be supplied. In an underemployed economy, to grow the private sector, you merely need to decrease the amount of taxation paid by those that'd spend the windfall.

&gt;Just look at France today

France is on the Euro, making them a poor comparison to a gov't with its own currency. The UK's peers are the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, etc. *Not* its Euro-using neighbours.

London has also been suffering because of British gangs. For long before Romanian gangs. Should we be wary of all British people because they're likely gang members? Gangs are a problem that affect us all. We've had gangs since long before the Kray Twins.

no public sector job has been guaranteed for the last few decades. This isn't going to change. It might be harder for them to fire people, but they still can and do make staff redundant. And the MoD budget isn't going to see a significant increase any time soon - quite the opposite in fact. 

anyone who describes a public sector salary as amazing is very confused - it's not unheard of to earn double the wages for the same job in private industry, perhaps even more.  With consulting or freelance work you could triple it or even more. 

and student debt is irrelevant in this case , because the increase in wages from the private sector far far far outweighs the amount you lose to student loan repayments. You might pay a whole 9% back for 30 years , vs earning (conservatively) 20% more for 30 years.

Maybe on reddit there's a bit more realism, but you're living under a rock if you don't think we have a delusional fanbase who feel top four is a realistic aspiration every fucking season. Our fans want investment now because they think we have the resources to qualify for the CL immediately. They are wrong. 

We are no where fucking near qualifying for the CL on a regular basis. Not even close. FFP does not prevent very gradual club growth (although it absolutely does restrict it in relation to the other teams), but it does prevent us from investing what would be necessary to reach the top four, say, next season. Or the next. Or probably every season until our stadium is built, and probably a number of seasons after that. 

Look at LFC. Bigger club than us, more money, more revenue, a global fanbase. They've spent a lot recently, but not anything completely ridiculous, and they were already flirting with violating FFP.

It is absolutely a barrier for clubs who aren't already very wealthy.

I agree that once the stadium is delivered, gradual growth is possible even under FFP, but I get the impression that people like us are in the minority as far as our yearly expectations are concerned. 

Most Spurs fans I see still believe fourth place is a very reasonable expectation each and every year, in spite of us spending at least zero net in the window and paying the sixth highest wages. This is why I included the ""anytime soon"" bit in my post. I realize it's possible, but not on the timetable that our fans seem to think it should be. 

Along the lines of other clubs growing with us, there was a Swiss Ramble article a while back that actually pointed out that relative to our peers we are actually growing at a slower rate. This is why I'm a bit hesitant to jump on the optimism train regarding the impact of a new stadium. 

Like, with the stadium are we going to even catch up to Liverpool's revenue? I doubt it. And they aren't even particularly close to being a perennial top four side. I mean even if our answer is to invest more in youth and gamble on young players hoping they turn into a Bale or a Modric, most other clubs are being forced to do the same thing because of FFP so it's going to be much harder. 

I just think FFP sort of puts everyone on the same sort of curve as far as spending and growth is concerned, relatively. You can't really push ahead without overachieving on the pitch on a regular basis. So if it's going to happen, it will be very gradual...I think 5-7 years is almost generous, barring something extreme happening like Abramovich somehow being stripped of his assets or Arsenal imploding when Wenger retires.

*Campaigners for integrated education complain of a wall of opposition from two main quarters. The first is the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), for which most Protestants vote. Peter Robinson, the first minister and leader of the DUP, has spoken in favour of integrated education. But his party has little to gain from a melting away of sectarian division.*

*The second opponent, unsurprisingly, is the Catholic church. It has fought a skilful defensive campaign, standing firm on religion while also arguing that the Catholic grammar schools should be open to all Catholic pupils, not just the brightest. To some, it seems that the church is stressing equality among Catholics as a subtle way to preserve religious separation. A few schools have bent under this pressure and dropped their academic entrance tests. Others, like Lumen Christi, are resisting.*

The steps:

* Set up an IVR on a different number. You could use Twilio, or you could have it running at home on a Raspberry Pi with a SIP (or IAX2) trunk, or 3CX on a virtual machine etc.

* Have your phone reject any numbers not in your contacts.

* Have any calls that don't reach you be diverted to your IVR number.

* Add your IVR number to your contacts.

Be aware that every stage of that process might be chargable, depending on how you set it up. 

You can port your main number over to your IVR (so when people ring your old mobile number, it goes directly to the IVR) and then get a different mobile number. Once the call is in your IVR, you can do all sorts of things with it. You can even put it in a queue if you want!

The reason our results worsened is because we had an incredibly difficult run-in facing Chelsea, Man Utd, Man City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton. Our brilliant run earlier in the season was against weaker sides. Against the best teams we dropped points. Simple as that. Nothing to do with the England job.

Sure, it sounds great, but when it's enacted in an already uneven playing field, it kind of freezes everything. Sure, our club will grow, but no faster than the clubs above us are growing. 

I'm not arguing for an even financial playing field in soccer of course...I think there are some truly massive clubs who have earned that status. I don't want soccer to turn into an American sport with league-enforced revenue sharing or other regulations. I just think FFP is almost the worst of both worlds...it maintains the status quo. 

I understand the need for FFP, and it's mostly to save clubs from going bankrupt.

I guess that's a cultural difference between Britain and America.  I feel like Britain has less class conflict simply because people accept the class system as a fact of life.  In America everyone tries to deny it, and the classes end up resenting each other for disproving the narrative through their existence.

Secondly, I do agree with everything you've said and more, yes people will always find ways to avoid the law and will find ways to circumvent it, yes, people fought and died to achieve the amount of liberty we enjoy today and yes, this does give the government exceptional and unthinkable powers over the common person.

In my view however, I don't believe privacy should be so important that it means extremism can be shielded by it, I believe the government should have the right to root out murderous intent even if it means that occasionally one of my boring emails to my significant other is read by someone at GCHQ. I'm happy to sacrifice my privacy for safety.

When it comes to corruption and blackmail, I feel that it isn't privacy or liberty that needs to fought for in this case, but a watchdog or better preventative measures that need to be put in place and insisted on by the governed (personally I feel that would be too much, but if it placates fears then I'm all for it).

I just feel that we don't really have a better option than increasing surveillance, and if we stay the way we are, then we're going to end up losing the fight against extremism and crime as it will eventually evolve out of the constraints we already have for it, and eventually make these systems meaningless if we don't evolve our ways to dealing with them aswell.",null,0,null,1431395549,null,0,1431395782,0,cr66o45,null,t3_35g7tc,null,t1_cr66o45,null,t1_cr4hxn1,null,null,null,1432906680,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;Snoopers Charter

If you are going to use the snowden revelations as an argument against the snoopers charter, then the snoopers charter is irrelevant anyway because they are already breaking the law.

&gt;TTIP

""to sue them in secret courts behind closed doors off the record.""

That does not happen. At all. ISDS does not involve secret courts; court documents are released. You clearly have done absolutely no research on the subject beyond nonsense spouted by Monbiot.

&gt;Zero Hours

These contracts aren't taking the place of good jobs. They are taking the place of no jobs. Do you have a solution that will cause every single zero hours contract to suddenly turn into a good job?

&gt;Food Banks

There still isn't conclusive evidence that growing food bank use is a result of growing food shortage, vs simply an increase in the avalibility, utility and success of food banks in delivering a service that has been needed for a long time. Regardless, food banks are not even a conservative policy.

&gt;Cuts

By this system of morality, infinite spending on services is justified. What, exactly, is the limit we should put on spending? I believe that limit is lower than what you believe that limit is.

&gt;Fracking

I am not trolling.

Be specific here. Link your cases. Link those carcinogenic chemicals (and note that 50% of all chemicals that have been tested for carcinogenicity have turned out carcinogenic). Fracking, when performed correctly, is an entirely safe process. If you say that ""corporations cannot be trusted to carry it out correctly"", that line of reasoning can be used to justify banning everything ever, so you need to be more specific and show clearly that the risks are higher than any potential reward can justify.

Regarding global warming, the alternative to Fracking is Coal which causes worse pollution and quantified, severe health effects. You want coal?

My entire point is, that we shouldn't drift explicitly in one direction, which some people have called for. We should continue to adovate balanced radical centrism, and take ideas from both sides of the traditional spectrum.

&gt;attacking unearned wealth, reducing monopolies and oligopolies, reforming and rebalancing tax to be more simplified and progressive

I completely agree with monopolies and oligopolies, we should be the champions of competitive, fair and high functioning capitalism, and oppose monopolies and oligopolies. 

We should word to rebalance and reform tax, for example i am a advocate for abolishing Council Tax and Business Rates and introducing the much more progressive Land Value Tax. 

We should always be advocating simplified and progressives taxes, and we should continue with the idea of raising the personal allowance, and ensuring the balance is always in favor of low and middle earners

&gt;having a new, careful examination of whether we can be a lot more creative with our economic solutions, using non-profit corporations and cooperatives a lot more.

Where things like cooperatives are voluntary and work well, sure, having a diverse market place is always a good thing.

null,false,Impacatus,null,null,null,"&gt;I think perhaps a negative consequence of the American dream is that people feel personally responsible for their position in life, as such 'working class' is seen as somewhat insulting, as though it implies a personal failing. Does that ring true?

Definitely.  I mean, it's hard to say one way or the other.  People from humble backgrounds do take pride in their culture and community.  Some people definitely do idealize ""working"" life, but I think it's more rare to call it ""working class"".  I think they treat it more as an alternate lifestyle than a lower place in a class hierarchy.

&gt;In Britain people generally take pride in that label, it refers more to the subculture you were brought up in rather than your current station in life. You could have a doctor who thinks of themselves as somewhat working class in this cultural sense.

That probably makes a difference.

&gt;We do have plenty of class resentment of our own though. I'd say snobbery in every direction still persists. Chav and toff are bandied about pretty liberally. I think my own resentment of posh voices in American media is an ingrained reverse snobbery, I resent the use of posh people in representing my nationality. Probably not a morally defensible position, but it's undeniably my gut feeling.

It makes sense.  It definitely is a lazy trope that I wouldn't mind seeing less of.",null,0,null,1431398848,null,0,false,0,cr68ewr,null,t3_35n4sv,null,t1_cr68ewr,null,t1_cr676ol,null,null,null,1432907632,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null
