Yes it looks like Sanchez was the first option, but he signed for Arsenal on July 10th. Remy failed the medical around July 27th. Was Remy the 2nd or 3rd or 5th option?. We don't know. Balotelli was signed on August 21st. For Remy to have been the second choice and Balotelli the third choice seems very unlikely. There was rumours of Falcao as I remember, but he wouldn't commit in time, and wages were probably an issue. But was he a preferred option before Remy or after?. There were rumours of Pedro, but he stayed at Barcelona. So did he refuse a move, did Barcelona quote too high a price, or did we have any interest?. Who knows?. Thats before you consider how many agents were probably in touch with the club trying to tout their player. Would we really had sat on our hands all that time to just consider Sanchez-Remy-Balotelli?

For players we didn't need, I'd agree I didn't see the point of Lallana. Or Manquillo. Some might argue for Origi too, but I think they were thinking long term and that his value will rise dramatically. But I wouldn't consider that candy store crazy buying.

http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/premier-league/blame-brendan-rodgers-the-six-men-who-must-share-liverpool-blame-30772858.html

&gt; **Mike Gordon, Director**
Gordon, who sits on the board of Liverpool and the club's parent company Fenway Sports Group, has been described as the man who runs Liverpool on a day-to-day basis, the link between owner John Henry and chief executive Ian Ayre. In his late forties, he has the deepest knowledge of football of anyone at FSG and is its eyes and ears on Merseyside.

A bit of his background here - http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/03/06/michael-gordon-plays-private-but-powerful-role-with-red-sox/LTyWgAifZdBWdqvLjLFt7H/story.html

He seems like an out and out finance guy. Apparently has great familial ties with FSG. Also 
&gt;“He spent his career essentially buying businesses through choosing stocks. He understands present value, all of the financial issues that exist in an organization as wide and diverse as this is.”

He runs the day to day activities at LFC, most likely having a big say in LFC transfers with Ayre. 

&gt;**Ian Ayre, Chief Executive Officer**
Born in Liverpool, Ayre was appointed commercial director at Anfield by the club's previous owners. Lifelong Liverpool fan who was appointed managing director by FSG and promoted again to chief executive earlier this year. Is responsible for negotiating transfer fees and contracts. Has explained the transfer committee theory thus: ""Your biggest expenditure line can't be the whim of any individual.""

Commercial man. A fan like most of us here. However, what football knowledge and background does he have, apart from a 3 year stint at a (with all due respect) smallish club, whose operations dont involve the fraction of what is required at LFC. Commercial man, to re-iterate. 

&gt;**Dave Fallows, Head of Recruitment**
Joined Liverpool amid great fanfare in the summer of 2012, leaving his role as first team recruitment and scouting co-ordinator at Manchester City, then the Premier League champions. Liverpool had been looking for a sporting director to succeed Damien Comolli, who left the club in April 2012, but dropped that search after Fallows' appointment.

Fallows was a key part of City’s staff where his role as “Football Scouting and Recruitment Coordinator” involved assigning scouts, filtering reports, preparing recommendations and presentations on the club’s targets, and compiling a database of scouted players. Seemingly his role at Liverpool is of a similar nature. (from the website This is Anfield) One of the most important man on the committee given his profile and role. Importantly, worked with Rodgers earlier. Which could mean that he was a Rodgers recommendation. 

&gt;**Barry Hunter, Chief Scout**
Former Wrexham and Reading defender who had a spell as Rushden and Diamonds manager which ended when he oversaw their relegation out of the Football League in 2006. Hunter, 43, joined Liverpool from Manchester City with Fallows. Hunter had been City's chief scout for Italy, Switzerland and Russia.

Another ex-Rodgers colleague. Seems he excels at some football scouting software that is used world over. Question is, why did he leave City, or cynically, why did City let him go? If he was all that good, they'd just pay him more. Seems like the analyst and statistician in the committee. 

&gt;**Michael Edwards, Head of Performance and Analysis**
Edwards analysis of potential targets makes him a key figure at Liverpool, where owner John W Henry has regularly spoken of his admiration of a 'Moneyball' philosophy - essentially the use of statistical analysis to find transfer bargains. Ayre has denied Liverpool have directly followed a Moneyball model but Edwards retains a significant influence over targets.

Brought along with Commolli when he came over. Apparently runs the stats and the equivalent of the Sabremetric for baseball for LFC. I remember reading somewhere that Sahin and Nastasic were targeted by him. Nastasic went to city and we know how Sahin ended up...Worked at Tottenham as his highest level. 

&gt;**Brendan Rodgers, Manager**
Appointed by Liverpool in 2012 following the departure of Kenny Dalglish, whose demise followed the ill-fated £35m signing of Andy Carroll, still the highest fee paid for an Englishman. Rodgers has input into signings but does not always get his way - players such as Michel Vorm and Ashley Williams might now be at Liverpool if he had have done.

I dont want to get into discussing this guy. All of us know what he's about and his history.*** Edit:*** Also, people who keep talking about him not having his way in player recruitment (which is false anyway) he would be aiming for Swansea players, who, by all accounts, would not take us to the next level. An example is Joe Allen. 

Thing of note in all this fiasco is that there;s not one person in there who is top level. The 2 most influential guys are commercial folks. The rest are coming from a lower level. There is a huge lack of leadership. I think FSG is still stabbing in the dark and finding that right structure. I dont think things will change much unless someone of a top level, who is a football person is brought in. There were rumors of us being linked with Txiki from Barcelona, probably that's the level we need to be aiming for. 

Edit 2: James Pearce once more proving that Rodgers is invisible to him. Not a word against the man. PR machine likely in over-drive. Time to salvage reputations.

null,false,oldcat,null,null,null,"In case of paywall:

&gt; The SNP last night warned other parties not make the House of Lords a 'house of losers' after the election by elevating defeated MPs as a consolation prize.
&gt; 
&gt; The Nationalists, who refuse to have SNP peers and want to abolish the Lords, challenged their opponents not to give a ""free pass"" to MPs who retire or get kicked out by voters on May 7.
&gt; 
&gt; The call comes amid speculation that LibDem Danny Alexander, who is tipped to lose his Inverness seat to the SNP, could be elevated to the Lords after a defeat.
&gt; 
This would allow him to continue serving as Chief Secretary to the Treasury if there was a second Tory-LibDem coalition.
&gt; 
&gt; Other LibDems tipped for peerages include Charlie Kennedy, who is struggling to defend his Ross, Skye and Lochaber seat, and Sir Menzies Campbell, who is retiring.
&gt; 
&gt; The LibDems want to overhaul the Lords and make it a fully elected chamber, with the number of peers almost halved to 450.
&gt; 
&gt; However in the meantime, the party is likely to keep adding to its current 101 peers.
&gt; 
&gt; Scottish Labour may also back peerages for senior figures such as former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and former Chancellor Alastair Darling, who are retiring.
&gt; 
&gt; A wave of losses to the SNP could also create a demand for seats in the Lords from Labour veterans such as Douglas Alexander, Dame Anne Begg and Margaret Curran.
&gt; 
&gt; The SNP accused Labour, the Tories and the LibDems of failing to make any significant reforms of the Lords in recent years, and said that until it was replaced there should be a moratorium on sending defeated or retiring MPs to the red benches.
&gt; 
&gt; Pete Wishart, SNP candidate for Perth &amp; North Perthshire, said the Lords was a ""deeply undemocratic, absurd institution"" which was ""bloated beyond repair"".
&gt; 
&gt; He said: ""The SNP has long believed there is no place for the unelected House of Lords in a modern democracy. The Lords should be scrapped and replaced with a fully elected and accountable second chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; ""In the meantime, the Westminster parties must ensure that politicians rejected at the ballot box - and those retiring from politics - will not be given a free pass to the Lords.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The public deserve clarity on this issue in the run up to polling day.
&gt; 
&gt; ""On top of this, the rules around Peers' allowances and expenses should be changed to ensure they are no longer exempt from tax.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Scottish Lords alone cost the taxpayer over £2m a year - at a time when more families are relying on foodbanks this is indefensible.""
&gt; 
&gt; A LibDem spokeswoman said: ""In our 11 seats it is a straight choice between the Lib Dems and the SNP. People know that a vote for the Lib Dems is a vote for a hard working MP who will invest £800m in our NHS and stop the SNP wrecking the recovery with their massive borrowing plans. It is our SNP opponents who should be exploring alternative employment opportunities.""",null,0,null,1430030121,null,0,false,0,cqozdjl,null,t3_33wbvf,null,t1_cqozdjl,null,t3_33wbvf,null,null,null,1432608891,null,6,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,6,null

&gt; Suarez is gone, Daniel is made out of wet paper and our striker recruitment has failed.

Here's your first reason. Failure to plan and lacking the foresight. Why would you rely on a player who has a huge history of injuries? Talent is not a doubt, the ability to stay on the pitch is never a given with this man. When you have so much money at your disposal, why wont you target top class strikers? All the top names we were looking at, apart from Costa who we looked at when Suarez was here, who was a proven, top class striker? 

Which nicely brings me to another point. When Carroll left, we almost had a similar situation where we were almost strikerless. No lessons were learnt as to what would happen to our season if we did the same thing again. And here we are today, similar clusterfuck.

b. Doesnt learn fast enough or adapt

Getting beat repeatedly in the begining of the season took him almost 4 months to recognize that the formation isnt working. Took him several defeats to reorganize this team. 

Adopted a different position. Worked wonders for a while. The formation was found out by opposing managers and they worked around it.  And since then, doestn know what to do. Looks clueless and it has now taken us the Villa game and 2 crunch losses to direct opposition for top 4. 

c. Rival games

His record speaks for itself. Except City, every other team we've played (Chelsea, Shower of Shit, Arsenal) Atleast he had it going for him by thrashing bottom teams last year. 

And think about this: It took him Luis Suarez and Sturridge to dismantle lower teams, but he could not find a solution how to use them to beat teams above us, or traditional top 4 rivals. 

d. Defence

""We dont need a defensive coach"". After leaking 50+ goals.

e. Unlimited sound bytes 

"" After spending 100 million you expect to be bla bla bla"". He's naive. He leaps before he looks. Invites pressure on himself, indirectly on his team. 

f. Varying philosophies

Death by possession one day, high pressures tactics the next, unlimited sideways and back passing the day after, a mix of all these the 4th day, Evertonian tactics the 5th day, change 9,999 formations in-game the 6th, and if nothing works, on the 7th day lump it to Ricky. 

g. Play legends and senior players who're way past it continuously

At the expense of compromising the the positions of other younger, more talented players.

h.Small time mentality

'The Swansea play-off will remain my biggest game even if we reach a CL final'. 
Yeah OK. On the eve of a semi final against a team with a new manager and in the relegation battle.

Their job is actually to scrutinise the Executive branch of Government on your behalf. Just some don't really seem to like doing it that very much. 

It isn't actually an MPs' job to sort out your neigbourhood leylandii dispute.

Many appear happy to pretend it is though.

Maybe because its less intellectually taxing than robust scrutiny of the Executive branch? Or they get a greater ego boost from local paper photographs at new school buildings they didn't pay for or even decision make on (actually a Stormont competence now). Or its just is an easier way to get votes from an electorate who appear unsure of what it is their MP is actually meant to be doing? Or a combination of all 3.

Whichever, its the democratic process of law making that suffers when MPs don't take their primaary function seriously. 

It does of course make it easier for the country to enter into ill conceived foreign military adventures, and for Governments to pass other terrible policy.

For reference as a practical example - ""hard working"" Sinn Fein MPs preaching to us about the terrors of ""austerity"" and welfare reform. Maybe in that context they would have been wise to do the ""hard work"" of actually turning up to vote on the Welfare Reform Bill then.

Or maybe I'm wrong.

There's a ""race"" to fix it because the financial crisis was exacerbated in the UK due to Labour needlessly increasing the deficit prior. Labour wanted to expand services and infrastructure but didn't want to raise taxes to pay for it (it would lose them votes) so they effectively took out loans and put it on the credit card with the belief that inevitable and perpetual growth would cover it.

In the next section you look specifically at the 'credibility' of an argument, and which different factors you can use, such as reputation, vested interest, and expertise to determine whether the argument is strong or valid.

In the topic I'm doing currently, you look at how to assess and develop your own arguments. For example, you look at the many different types of flaws that somebody may include in an argument, or they may include 'appeals' or an 'overdrawn argument'. 

Now and then, there are some more interesting areas, such as discussing the principles behind certain morals, and *sometimes* being able to go out into the real world and being able to use the five rules of credibility to things that I see - very exciting indeed.

Moreno missed a practise because he overslept allegedly. He meets up with the team later at the pub for lunch. Brendan was there as well and he saw Moreno and wasn't pleased. People are saying he was stressed because the last few games are crucial for Rodgers' career at liverpool and having a starter miss training is not ideal.

Because of the language barrier Moreno does not understand well and Brendan starts to raise his voice to get him to understand his anger. Moreno gets defensive and argues back and tells Rodgers to relax and tried to explain he overslept accidentally. 

This is all happening in public for all to see. Rodgers then realised the fuss he made and told Moreno he'd be dropped ""indefinitely"" and Enrique would slowly be integrated back into the side. Moreno may be sold this summer due to this event so we may be in the market for a new Left back.

We're going to turn into an island suburb. We can't just keep building more houses.

Population control, as in immigration control and benefits for having fewer than 3 children is an idea I've thought about. Our population won't increase if we have fewer children and take in fewer immigrants. The whole world would benefit from people having fewer children. There would be more to go around.

As a sort of wacky idea though, maybe constructing an entirely new modern city that somehow allows high population density with the amenities and workplaces to support them instead of just building more houses without the support structure.

He's completely useless for the team when we have the ball. He doesn't attack the box, he doesn't make runs, he holds on to the ball for too long, he just waits for the ball to take on somebody or just shoot from distance. 

If that's his style then what's the other striker gonna do with him? He has to make all the runs for Balotelli, take all the gambles - do all the attacking. Who wants to be in partnership like that? Suarez and Sturridge worked so well because they both are intelligent and hard-working strikers.

I'm not one of these lefty types who say things like ""the maw of global capitalism"", but it's common knowledge that the current type of system has ups and downs - periods of growth and periods of shittiness.

Ideally, the country should be spending moderately during the good times, and saving money to weather the storm during the bad times. We haven't behaved that well historically - choosing to spend on expensive welfare programs during the good times, leaving us less flexibility for the bad times. That leaves us in the current situation, where deficit is a bit *too* big and we need to cut spending during bad times. In theory, clearing the deficit by 2020 would leave us better prepared for the future.

Also, don't confuse deficit and debt. Deficit is the gap between income (i.e. the taxes we pay, businesses pay etc) and spending (welfare, military, NHS etc). Debt is the outstanding balance. If you have a negative deficit, you are adding to the debt every year. If you have a neutral deficit, the debt stays the same (and is gradually eroded by inflation). A surplus is where the government takes in more than they spend - in which case they could give money back to people, save it, or increase spending.

Even Sturgeon with all her ""end austerity"" talk is only talking about a technicality. She proposes very mild spending increases in reality. Add a few other silly policies like Trident, mainly for use as bargaining chips, and they're not so different. It's also incredibly easy to make the SNP successful.

The other far bigger reason is that of future economic growth, the UK has an ageing population that will start hitting budgets hard from about 2027 making a balanced budget ever more difficult.


&gt;I understand that having balanced books and zero debt is a good thing

Some debt is good for an economy as we can borrow very cheaply, this is the major argument normally put forward by those against austerity, however our debt load does need to be reduced. 

&gt;Am I missing something

Economic growth is not something which we shouldn't take for granted, we have an ageing population that will, like in Japan hit  our growth in the coming years. It's worth pausing to think that Japan a leader in innovation and robotics has only just managed to stay stagnant over the past decade.

Dropped the bike narrowly missing my leg. Looked a right tit at one of the busiest times in Tesco. No one even came to see if I was ok or help me lift the bike. Luckily I'm pretty strong so it wasn't an issue.

Mushroom took the brunt of it followed by the front brake lever (bent a little) and a few small scratches on the bar end mirror and exhaust.

Managed to sort it so I can use a reminder with the lock (the throat only just fits the disc so won't allow room for the reminder so I fitted it with a cable tie).

null,false,notDvoiduRlooKin4,null,null,null,"&gt;You know that you're excusing his lack of football intelligence by saying it's his style? And how deep does he want to play? Midfielder? He's a striker.

Yep you got it dude, every single striker in the world has an identical play style. How did I not know that, how silly of me.

&gt;He's completely useless for the team when we have the ball. He doesn't attack the box, he doesn't make runs, he holds on to the ball for too long, he just waits for the ball to take on somebody or just shoot from distance.

Yep, lets have him attack the box when its him in the box with 3 people between him and the ball and then another 2 people marking him. Not only is this a position where he doesn't want to be, its created because teams can afford to crowd the box against us. Its effective because nobody else in the team can shoot. Aston Villa did it to us, Chelsea too, they know that our midfielders and AMs are awful when it comes to scoring. 

&gt;If that's his style then what's the other striker gonna do with him? He has to make all the runs for Balotelli, take all the gambles - do all the attacking. Who wants to be in partnership like that? Suarez and Sturridge worked so well because they both are intelligent and hard-working strikers.

Suarez and Sturridge was deadly because they both created space for each other, and once Suarez started going he was always able to find Sturridge free. At the moment, they can crowd Balotelli and there isn't anything he can do. Maybe you haven't actually seen him play before, but he has good technical ability and the strength and sufficient burst to frequently beat his man, but that means little when there are 2 more players able to block his path. He is not a good lone striker, and to judge him on his ability in a position which we already knew that he doesn't have the traits to play is pathetic. It would be the same as writing off Sterling, Markovic or Henderson when they were playing RB/RWB. 

In addition to all this, everybody knows how to shut us down now. How often were teams sitting this deep against us last season? If they continued to play like that, Coutinho and Henderson would be laughing as they played Sterling and Markovic though countless times every game. 

I said it before, when we just had Suarez up front with Carroll. We did the same thing, we just passed it around outside the box, every other part of the game was fine except in the final third. Our full backs were decent back then, our defense was doing well, and our midfield IMO was quite good. But we just passed it around outside the box because nobody other than Suarez could really threaten, and he would just take tons of pot shots as a result, and not get a whole lot done. That wasn't his fault, that was down to a squad that had such poor goal threats that it made it easy for the opposition to shut us down.

Markovic was an awful signing for us to make, we already had several promising wide players and with Suarez going out, we needed to sign someone with a bit of experience that would actually be a real threat in front of goal. How did you expect this season to go when you literally have 2 players that can hit the ball, one of which being extremely injury prone, and the other not being able to play without the former?",null,0,null,1430038328,null,0,1430038593,0,cqp1df6,null,t3_33u3o3,null,t1_cqp1df6,null,t1_cqp0qbl,null,null,null,1432609832,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

That's certainly the truth. The SNP and Labour manifestos are strikingly similar. 

So that in mind, and considering that not even the SNP are asking for another referendum in the next parliament (and Labour certainly won't be volunteering one)- why are the Lib Dems ruling out working with the SNP, but not Labour? If they're content to deal with Labour's policy platform, why not the SNP's (they can even make a ""strictly no independence referendums"" clause if they're desperate).

I'd say it' because the Lib Dems are desperate to get back into bed with the Tories, and are ranging around for excuses why they don't have to even consider Labour.

 [**Median voter theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median%20voter%20theorem): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __median voter theorem__ states that ""a [majority rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_rule) voting system will select the outcome most preferred by the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) voter"". 

&gt;The median voter theorem makes two key assumptions. First, the theorem assumes that voters can place all election alternatives along a [one-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-dimensional) [political spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum).  It seems plausible that voters could do this if they can clearly place political candidates on a left-to-right continuum, but this is often not the case as each party will have its own policy on each of many different issues. Similarly, in the case of a [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum), the alternatives on offer may cover more than one issue. Second, the theorem assumes that voters' preferences are [single-peaked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_peaked_preferences), which means that voters choose the alternative closest to their own view. This assumption predicts that the further away the outcome is from the voter's most preferred outcome, the less likely the voter is to select that alternative.  It also assumes that voters always vote, regardless of how far the alternatives are from their own views. The median voter theorem implies that voters have an incentive to vote for their true preferences. Finally, the median voter theorem applies best to a [majoritarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majoritarian) [election system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_system).

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"Some ideas, some more realistic than others:

* **Abolish green belt**. Greenbelt was a good idea when it was first implemented, however, there have been a number of economic studies examining it over the last 10 years, which now consider green belt to be one of the biggest drags on the economy and biggest contributors to wealth disparity in the country.

* **Council tax changes**. Council tax should be simplified - it should be based on current property value (e.g. 1% of current value), and revalued every 5 years. It would be paid by the owner, and it would be enforced by a charge on the property which would ensure that default would be impossible. At the same time, once planning permission is granted for construction of a new house, the land becomes eligible for council tax on the day that the permission is granted; this will help ensure rapid construction and avoid abandoned projects. Finally, apply punitive council tax rates (e.g. 5% of value per year) if residential property is owned by an ""overseas non-natural person"" - i.e. a foreign shell company.

* **Land value taxation**. Landlords profit from the work and investment of others. They buy a property in a slum, do nothing to it, but over the years, the government puts a crossrail station in it, the council spruces up the neighbouring streets, they get a local stadium, etc. The landlord has made a huge profit, off the back of other's labour and capital.
By taxing the value of the land, this parasitic income is taxed. It also has the advantage of discouraging under-occupation; the lone OAP living in their 6 bedroom family home would be encouraged to downsize due to the tax burden, freeing up the property for someone who needs it.

* **Banning of mortgage forbearance.** It sounds harsh, but it's been adequately shown that once someone falls seriously behind on their mortgage, that they very rarely recover; in general, because they couldn't afford the property in the first place; or because of a permanent life change. It would make sense to limit the bank's exposure to the bad loan, and free up the property for someone who can afford to live there. So, I would make it mandatory for a bank/court to repossess within 28 days of the 3rd mortgage payment being missed; the bank would face huge fines if it failed to do so. At the same time, the bank would not be allowed to ""hoard"" possessed property, and they would have 90 days to sell the property on the open market, or face huge fines.

* **Ban all subsidies and price manipulations for home purchase.** Government funded schemes like Help-to-buy, right-to-buy, First-buy; and house builder schemes like First-start, dream-start, etc. All banned. Vendor paid deposit and stamp duty - also banned. The price of house purchase needs to be transparent and the rules simple. The government schemes are simply props to keep house prices high. The builders' schemes are intended to obfuscate the price, and allow a much higher price to go on the land registry official document than the price that was actually paid.

a.

You can't blame failed transfers solely on Rodgers. BR wanted Remy but the deal fell through for reasons unknown. 
Balotelli was sort of a proven class striker but he turned out to be shit.
Furthermore, what top class striker changed clubs this summer? 

Falcao? Well he turned out to be shit. 

Diego Costa? Was always going to Chelsea.

Bony? While a very good player, would he have fit the system? Tbh i have not watched him play enough to give a rating here.

It won't be easy to find a top class striker this summer either. To find these 15+, 20+ a season striker is probably the hardest part in the transfer market. And to replace someone of Suarez' caliber we would need to buy a Lewandowski or Agüero.
Lacazette is obviously the dream for next season as he is basically french sturridge without injuries but are we attractive enough for him?

b.

Yes, his stubbornness is something he could improve. Although i highly rate his tactical approach when reshuffling our system. 

The diamond nearly won us a league

The 343 saved a horrible season into a somewhat decent one. 4th was never a given

c.
Certainly an area he has to improve. A lot of this seasons rival games disasters is down to mentality. Suarez was this wild lunatic who happens to be the 3rd best player in the world and that fact elevated the entire team.

The SAS didn't dismantle games by themselves. They were the spearhead of our attack cause Rodgers built the team around them so he could get the maximum goal output.
Playing Stevie as a six was his most attacking change since he took over the job. He knew we would leak more goals that way, but he relied on outscoring.

d.
Yeah, no we are tied for the 5th best defensive record in the league currently. Migs is probs gonna win the golden glove.
We did not need in fact a defensive coach.

e.
True he talks a lot and some, if not most of it, seems to come back and bite him but i couldn't care less about it. 
What managers and players say to the press is irrelevant most of the time. They all have media training.

f.
I'd argue having a tactically flexible coach is highly beneficial to the club. Although i agree that he should react quicker.

g.
Yep

h.
Have never seen that quote and i never thought about Rodgers as someone who doesn't belong here. He knows exactly where he's at and he knows that he has to deliver, his quotes thinking about getting sacked mid season confirm that to me. But surely he has never won a top flight title that seems to be an issue for some fans.

I'm alright with ostricision of some, it just needs to happen with a squad of mediocrity like ours. But this transfer window is important. The club needs to show they get what the problems are with the squad. If we could get rid of 7-8, sign 2-3 quality players with the right attitude, and get Pritch, Ali, and the most promising youth players in and around the squad, I think we'll be looking good.

But it's still a long term plan. We all want to see improvement next year. But the reality is, the current core of our team will peak in several years time. That's going to be too late for Lloris and Vertonghen. But we can have seriously high hopes for Kane, Bentaleb, and Eriksen (providing he stays), all in the same team.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"Tax-deduction means that you can claim your costs against your income - so that you only pay tax on profit.

For example, I'm a widget maker - I buy £1000 worth of widget parts, and make widgets, which I sell for £2500. I've made £1500 profit, so I pay income tax on the £1500. 

A landlord can do the same. They let a property for £1000 a month. Each month they pay £600 mortgage - of which £250 is interest and £350 is capital repayment. After 1 year, they need to redecorate, at a cost of £800, service the boiler £200, pay buildings insurance £100, pay the agent £1000.

Their expenses are £250 * 12 + £800 + £200 + 100 + 1000 = £5100. Note that the *repayment* part of the mortgage payment is not an expense - it's effectively like depositing money into a savings account, so it is not tax allowable. 

So, at the end of the year, they have received £12000 rent, and paid £5100 expenses - so their profit is £6900, and it is that £6900 which they have to pay tax on.

Note that profit this is different to *cashflow*. This is how much cash is left at the end of the year. Let's assume that our landlord has a good full-time job which puts him into the 40% tax band - as a result all the rental profit will be taxed at 40%. 

So, at the end of the year, they will have to pay £2760 in tax, leaving a net-profit after tax of £4140. Note that the mortgage *capital* component, which has to be paid *after tax* is £350 * 12 = £4200; this is more than the profit after tax. In other words, this business is draining the landlord's cash - he will have less money in his bank account at the end of the year, than at the start - because of the money being used to pay down the mortgage.

I'd say the defence has definitely improved with Caulker no longer making silly mistakes and Onouha being more concentrated. Attacking we've always be strong, but I'd say he's made us less reliant on Charlie with goals from Fer, Hill, Vargas, Zamora and Phillips. Sadly, he's also been unlucky with injuries.

He was always being thrown into a shitty situation, having come in just after transfer day. If Chris stays in the job I can see him selling a lot of our older players and with the  increased security the championship will bring, he can introduce youth squad players into the team.  

I just hope Fernandez looks past the results when he decided who'll be manager next season, Harry left Chris in a shit situation which was almost impossible to recover from.

People can criticise Chris all they want, but we are definitely playing better football then we did under Harry, even if it's not show by the results (which have been damaged a lot by bad luck). Just look at Matt Phillips who was ignored by Redknapp, yet recently has been our best player.

null,false,MaesterWeasel,null,null,null,"&gt; Yep you got it dude, every single striker in the world has an identical play style. How did I not know that, how silly of me.

That makes him an extremely limited player. So, what is his playing style then? Trying his luck from distance? Because I've not seen much different ideas from him. That's not sustainable strategy to score, teams only resort to that when they're desperate. 

&gt; Yep, lets have him attack the box when its him in the box with 3 people between him and the ball and then another 2 people marking him. 

That's striker's job, strikers score goals that way. He's physically much more powerful than most of the defenders, he has the advantage. If he doesn't score goals, what does he do actually? When someone is in promising crossing positition, Balotelli is rarely taking the gamble and trying to get to the end of it. 

&gt; Its effective because nobody else in the team can shoot.

Shooting from distance isn't the only way to score against stubborn defence. Strikers can also help to drag defenders out of position, but they have to make runs for that, take gambles. Last season we scored in Hawthorns because Sturridge was making himself available in the back post like a proper striker does. 

&gt; At the moment, they can crowd Balotelli and there isn't anything he can do. 

Yes he can, he can do lots. If you watched Coutinho yesterday then you saw that he was always looking to play through balls to Balotelli, but where was he? He was basically standing in front of Coutinho or besides him. Why not just take a gamble - running behinf the defence puts defenders under pressure. If he stays in front of the defence then the defenders have the easiest game of their lives. When Johnson or Sterling was about to cross the ball Balotelli wasn't ready to attack it. These are striker 101.

* Make runs for other players (for others and for yourself - dragging defenders out of position is very underrated skill in football)

* Always gamble with crosses, whether it's back-post or near-post is up to players to put in place in training.

* Don't stand still! Look for chances rather than wait for chances to fall into your feet

&gt; He is not a good lone striker, and to judge him on his ability in a position which we already knew that he doesn't have the traits to play is pathetic.

But he is a **striker** and he does none of those points above. He is not a midfielder, he's a striker. Apparently not a very good one.

&gt; How did you expect this season to go when you literally have 2 players that can hit the ball, one of which being extremely injury prone, and the other not being able to play without the former?

I expected Sturridge to be less injured. That has been his worst year with injuries in his career, we couldn't have predicted it really, not in that extent. He had relatively good year regarding injuries last year - more reason to believe that he won't completely down suddenly. He's hardly a Diaby. I expected Balotelli to resemble a striker, but I guess I hadn't seen him enough before to know that it might not happen. I expected us to sell Borini and bring someone better in to replace him. Instead of that happening we now have completely useless player that we don't want. I expected us to be in contention for top 4 but I knew it would be difficult if United got their shit together. 

If someone had said to me before the start of the season that Sturridge is injured practically the whole season I'd have written the season off in an instant, regardless of how our new signings fit in and played.

I think you are making too large a point about our ageing population, Britain thanks to its large migrant population (which are generally younger, healthy and have a larger work participation rate than natives) will weather this storm far more easily than other mature economies. 

Your example of Japan actually can work the other way, their economy has stagnated and they have an extraordinary level of government debt, 226% of GDP, and yet the interest on their bonds are extraordinarily low, 0.28% on a 10 year bond. It seems that it is investor confidence rather than the actual size of the debt which is important, as long as the country keeps servicing it's debt it can have as much as it wants. I am not suggesting we get to such insane levels and follow Japan's example, rather having a large amount of debt does not necessarily impede on a country's ability to function and run even during recession or under the stresses of an ageing population.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"Very much off the main path, put probably one of my favourite places in the world is [Eskdale](http://www.eskdale.info/). Getting there is going to be a pain if you don't have your own transport (and even then, it's quite a drive from any major transport artery) but its worth it in my opinion. The place is beautiful and peaceful, there's good beer in the local pubs and it's touristy enough (as in, the pubs serve food that isn't reheated pies, and there are things like the [Laal Ratty narrow gauge railway](http://ravenglass-railway.co.uk/) nearby if you want some novelty/a trip to the coast). If you're experienced you may want to try scaling England's highest mountain, [Scafell Pike](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=scafell+pike&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=Usz&amp;channel=fs&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nas8VZ70F8q9afKZgZgE&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1311&amp;bih=641#) (though I must stress *only* if you know what you are doing. Granted, it's not like climbing the Eiger, but ill-prepared and inexperienced people have died on the Lake District's fells in the past). If not, there are less strenuous walks up to the [Hardknott Roman fort](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/hardknott-roman-fort/) (situated on possibly the [worst road in the country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardknott_Pass)), lower-level fell walks over into Wasdale (home of the country's [biggest mountain, deepest lake, smallest church and biggest liar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasdale_Head)) or even just gentle riverside walks. 

This would probably be perfect for your photography interest, though you may need a bit more imagination to get your history fix. There are nearby Roman sites but not much else; most of the history in the Lake District is tied up in its [place names](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbrian_toponymy), so with a bit of digging around, you can get a feel for the history of the place in a way. The main attraction is in the peacefulness though. The place was once on the frontier of the civilised world (as the Roman's knew it), so it's a nice place to escape the world for a while. 

In terms of your trip, car access would be highly recommended (though you could get a train to Ravenglass and use the narrow gauge railway to get into Eskdale), so it would make sense to drop by during your wander south. It isn't really en-route anywhere though (and I would heavily recommend accessing the area from the coast; driving through the middle of the county means tackling two mountain pass roads famed for being littered with smashed bits of car), so if you want to experience the Lake District without it taking forever, [Ambleside](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambleside) or Windemere are both on the Western edge (probably about 40 minutes drive from the M6), both are nice places to visit (though much more touristy) with more museums etc. to visit, and are ideal places to hop onto a boat tour of England's largest lake.

And one further suggestion would be [South Queensferry](http://www.visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/south-queensferry-p240281) (near Edinburgh), even if only for some fish and chips and a few minutes looking at a brilliant example of Victorian-era engineering. You may also like to get a ferry over to [Inchcolm Island](http://www.maidoftheforth.co.uk/inchcolm-island) (you can get a boat right underneath the Forth Railway Bridge and as I remember, the abbey on the Island is quite well-preserved).

He could do with getting stronger like Sterling has. He is too easily pushed off the ball. He certainly is a talent.

&gt; Finally, Why isn't FSG willing to my proven players, but they rather buy young prospects and plan to groom them.

They are willing to buy proven and more experienced players but only when they're available for us for reasonable sum and they definitely improve us. That can make Lovren's transfer seem weird but we were basically catfished by that transfer. Lallana's transfer seemed reasonable but a tad too expensive, he has been injured too much to assess him properly. Lambert was cheap back-up.

Also, we can potentially get much more return out of younger talent. As with all the transfers we have to find the right players with biggest potential. Of the current crop I don't think I'd say any of them have outright failed. All of them have shown potential but it's hard to shine as a youngster in a team that's underperforming that much.

null,false,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"Speaking as a private landlord, when I saw the headlines I thought ""oh god, what idiocy is this"" but looking into the details this brings nothing to fear. The proposals are as follows:

1) After an initial 6 month probation, tenants can ask for a 3 year agreement. During the 3 year agreement rent can't go up by more than inflation. 
How it will work for me in practice: Get a tenant in on a 6 month agreement (as per usual), and see how they are. If after 6 months they prove a decent tenant they can have a 3 year agreement if they want it, though of course I will set the rate of rent appropriately knowing I can't change it for 3 years. At this point they can either pay market rate for a 6 month agreement, or market rate+15% for a 3 year fixed agreement. All good with me! 
Interestingly, these three year agreements also seem to be weaker than the current 6 month agreements offered, judging by the phrase on the BBC article: ""Labour says three-year tenancy agreements should become the norm, with landlords having to give two months' notice before asking a tenant to leave and only if they have a ""good reason"" to do so."". Currently the only way I can remove a tenant mid-tenancy agreement is via a Section 8, and that's only if they're 8 weeks or more behind on rent. So dependent on what Labour consider a ""good reason"", these new agreements could actually be preferable to the current ones for a landlord!

2) Tenants will have the legal right to ask what the previous tenant paid in rent. Apparently this will help them secure a better deal?!?

3)""Rogue"" landlords face losing tax relief enabling them to offset 10% of their annual rental income against falls in the value of furniture and appliances if they don't keep the property to a ""certain standard"". Firstly, I never knew about this tax relief.. I must remember to speak with my accountant about this! Secondly, how on earth are labour planning to enforce this?

Well, London would no longer be that attractive of a place for landlords (or any rational person to buy), due to its 'Wild West' draconian licensing system that could easily have tenants force their landlords to sell the property to them.

This would lead to the housing market to crash, the political party tries to backtrack on ""reforms"" but by then, it's far too late.

null,false,explax,null,null,null,"The very real housing crisis that keeps on going in the south east is due to the number of jobs growing at a far higher rate than anywhere else in the country. This is due to the effect of long term lack of investment in people and infrastructure in other regions of the UK and there is no policy that the government can implement apart from forcing companies to stop supplying new jobs to the south east.

The second problem is a lack of proper housing stock for the needs of people. There are millions of single people in their 20s living in houses in house-shares. This is madness (in my opinion). There is a clear lack of well-built, standard, non-luxury apartments, probably due to NIMBYism where they would be built (leading to most new flats being built in town centres, whereby for a few extra quid they can build them luxury). 

The fact is we then have millions of quite well-paid young people in house-shares who could potentially be living in these flats which could be better for their needs at a fraction of the space required (and could probably be made cheaper). This would then allow the houses they currently occupy be re-released to people wanting to start their own families. In Manchester, this is happening already in student areas whereby old student housing stock is being moved back into family use - due to new purpose built apartments and less students.

New houses are of course required and perhaps government grants should be used to encourage construction on old brownfield sites that are no longer required - this is beneficial than building 'new towns' as they can already be part of a city and will likely be more attractive and some infrastructure will already exist. My only concern with liberalising the planning process is that we will get housing estates which are poorly served by transport infrastructure (limiting access to jobs) and poor environmental credentials.

Investment in the North of England will hopefully continue into the next parliament, bringing with it increased business confidence, leading to a growth in jobs.

La Masia graduates Gerard Piqué, Pepe Reina and Carles Puyol “pranks” Cesc Fabregas by pulling a Barcelona shirt over his head at Spain’s celebrations for winning the World Cup.

d)walking out of the stadium at half time durning the Emirates Cup first day and not even bothering to show up for the second


To exacerbate all of this he was club Captain, 

In summary there is a lot of bad blood between Arsenal supporters because 

1)He refused to train or play to force a move walking out at half time e.g. in the Emirates cup


2) Doing nothing, and it's speculated to encourage the public tapping up of him. Over the period of 2 months,  that neutral  observers said 

According to El Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona have clearly broken FIFA tapping up rules by agreeing a five-year deal with Cesc Fabregas – without written consent from Arsenal, and before agreeing a transfer fee with the north London club.

This led to Arsenal getting a much lower price for a player in his peak, than was the case in Ronaldo, or Suarez where the teams were fully compensated.

Moreover, there is argument that he worsoned the relationship between Arsenal fans, by  alleging that they had the opportunity to sign him and turn there back on him. When comments from Wenger reveal that he  believes the deal with Chelsea occured early last yea, it wasn't that simple.

4)Gerrard still playing that long because he has some control over Rodgers.

null,false,SYSTEM_USER,null,null,null,"The law states that ""maintenance"" can be tax allowable against income, but ""upgrades"" are only tax allowable against capital. In practice, HMRC are unlikely to find out, but they do occasionally investigate, especially if a LL's rental profit is not as high as it should be.  A LL must report the total rent income, and the total amount of each class of expenses to HMRC - so an excessive amount of refurbishment costs will be noticed, if it went on year by year.

Income is the profit you make after your ongoing annual income is deducted from your ongoing expenses.

Capital is the price you pay for a new asset (like buying a new house). Profit on the sale price of an asset, is taxed at the capital gains rate.

So, let's say a LL bought a house in 2008 for £150k, and sells it in 2015 for £300k. They've made £150k in capital gains. After the sale goes through, they'll be sending a cheque to HMRC for the tax owing (about £22k in this case).

So, let's say that in 2013, the LL refits the kitchen which is a low end kitchen and has worn out.

Scenario 1:
The LL refits the kitchen in 2013 with another low-end kitchen at a cost of £5k. Their normal annual profit is £4k. The cost of the refit wipes out the 2013 profit, and in 2013, the LL has made a loss of £1k. There is no tax to pay in 2013, and the loss can be carried over into 2014, to reduce the tax bill in 2014.

Scenario 2:
The LL refits teh kitchen in 2013 with a top-end kitchen at a cost of £20k. Only the cost of a comparable low=end kitchen is income allowable (£5k). As above, they LL has made a loss of £1k, which can be carried over into 2014. However, the additional £15k capital allowance can go into reducing the capital gains bill when the LL sells. 

In 2015, the LL sells for £310k (better price, because of upgraded kitchen). This is offset against the purchase price £150k and the upgrade price £15k - so the capital gain is £310k - £150k - £15k = £145k. The total tax bill in this case would be about £21k (it's less because the kitchen cost more than the gain in price).",null,0,null,1430045400,null,0,false,0,cqp2rb6,null,t3_33uq0s,null,t1_cqp2rb6,null,t1_cqp2hcx,null,null,null,1432610484,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;but are not counted in the media

They are counted. Before 9/11 I never heard of Islamic terrorism, yet I heard plenty about terrorists. There were 29 people killed in a car park near where I live by a terrorist attack in 1998 and dozens more smaller attacks in the years before.

&gt;“White privilege is knowing that if this bomber turns out to be white, the United States government will not bomb whatever corn field or mountain town or stale suburb from which said bomber came, just to ensure that others like him or her don’t get any ideas. And if he turns out to be a member of the Irish Republican Army we won’t bomb Dublin. And if he’s an Italian-American Catholic we won’t bomb the Vatican.”

And if he turned out to be Saudi we wont bomb Saudi Arabia. If he turns out to be Egyptian, we wont bomb Egypt. This is racist, plain and simple. The only time we bomb countries to kill terrorists it's because either they don't have the power to deal with it themselves and they give us permission, or their government is complicit. It's nothing at all to do with race. The USA is allied with the vast majority of Muslim countries and bombs terrorists mainly to protect the civilians in those countries, who are &gt;95% of the victims of terrorism. Without the war on terror, many more Muslim civilians may have died. Just look at Syria where the US didn't get involved. When was the last time the USA bombed a place because of a terrorist attack on US soil? 2001? [There have been actual attacks supported by Muslim government](http://www.jewishpress.com/news/abbas-honors-al-quds-u-hero-arab-responsible-for-most-dead-jews/2013/12/12/), [on US soil, in which the US didn't launch any response.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirhan_Sirhan)

&gt;If recent history is any guide, if the bomber ends up being a white anti-government extremist, white privilege will likely mean the attack is portrayed as just an isolated incident — one that has no bearing on any larger policy debates.

Funny that they turned out to be Muslim, and it was portrayed as an isolated incident by some teenagers who were mad at America and not part of a terrorist group.

I stress we shouldn't replace him for the sake of it, but for Klopp? Absolutely. Maybe Rodgers stays and does really well, i'm not saying it couldn't happen, but there are not signs that we'll progress.

All this fucking talk of the transfer committee is stupid as well. People blaming the committee for the fails of this season. First of all, the shite players- Lovren and Lallana, who we spunked 50m on, were his choice. The others not so much. The real point though is that Rodgers obviously agreed to this when he signed on.

If he stays he should have no say on transfers, and should stick to coaching. He can be a good coach, but he's awful on judging players, especially defenders. Why does Johnson continue to play when Manquillo did so well earlier in the season? He rated Lovren over Sakho, and actually bought the former to replace the latter.

It's just a catalogue of shit that's floating around, and people are understandably getting sick of it. Everyone is still going to support the club, but if he stays and things don't improve next season why should everyone lay off him?

Brendan is a young manager who despite all odds nearly won us our first title in 25 YEARS IN HIS SECOND SEASON. Considering we were up against rich clubs such as Chelsea and City who have squads overflowing with quality that is spectacular.

That is an achievement that should buy him some time, and if you look at our signings over the summer that is clearly his mindset. Players like Can, Markovic, Moreno and Origi were not bought to bring instant success. Alongside other players such as Sterling, Ibe, Sakho, Henderson and Coutinho we have some fantastic young talent who Brendan is looking to nurture into a great team within the next 2-3 years. Before the United and Arsenal games I imagine you were singing Brendan's praises as a tactical genius, but after 3-4 poor games he now does not warrant a future at the club. Mourinho, Fergie, Benitez et al have all had runs like this at one point or another and it didn't mean they were bad managers. There are very few other managers in the world who could have done what Brendan did last season and that makes him pretty special and worth keeping hold of.

&gt; In late July I think it was, a German General paid us a visit, a sort of AOC inspection, I assume.

&gt;A large, sparkling black Mercedes pulled up inside the compound, and he got out of it, together with the Kommandant, von Lindeiner. As they left for their tour of the compound, von Lindeiner, seeing all too well the prisoners who had surged up around them, told them smartly to keep their distance.

&gt;But the General, brimming with self-confidence, said, ‘No, no. The driver will keep watch.’ Like his boss the General, the driver didn’t know much about POWs; he was far too polite, fielding a constant stream of questions from two German-speakers while the rest of the rabble scrambled over the car, in evident awe and admiration.

&gt;After giving the driver some cigarettes the crowd dispersed, together with the General’s gloves, torch, maps and tool-kit, and a handbook optimistically marked ‘Secret’.

&gt;Although the driver, poor sod, was probably already on his way to the Russian Front when von Lindeiner came into the compound next day and suggested to the SBO [Senior British Officer] that if the handbook were returned the other losses would be ignored and no reprisals taken, we all knew that really, the General was far too embarrassed about having been so easily taken in, and would be only too glad for every reference to be hushed up.

&gt;And there was no point in keeping the book anyway, as the German speakers had been through its every nook and cranny, finding there very little of interest or military value. Roger Bushell quickly arranged for a special stamp to be made and applied to the front pages. The General got his book back stamped: ‘Passed by the POW Board of Censors.’

Trouble is, people often *need* to move house - when their job moves or they need to be near relatives or whatever. If they are unable to sell, then they can only rent. That's why falling house prices drives up rental demand.

You might counter that landlords would at least be able to let out (even if at a loss) while they are trying to sell, but sadly it's even harder to sell houses with sitting tenants. In extremis, there would be nothing to stop landlords just handing the keys over to the bank and walking away. Banks would be saddled with large numbers of unsellable properties. Are *they* going to let them out?

And besides, looking at that list isn't really particularly enlightening.  Westminster and the Cadogans are only rich because of London property price inflation, so when that crashes it'll wipe half their wealth off the map, Hinduja is a global businessman who happens to be based in the UK but owns most of his interests in India and some in the US, Ashley and Green are mostly lucky we're in a massive asset-pricing bubble right now because their businesses are ridiculously overvalued, and Branson is a bullshitter of titanic proportions who exploited state contracts to get rich.  Nice guy though, from what I've heard.  

Fact is, their wealth isn't evidence of some evil rich people taking money from the mouths of the poor, it's mostly just due to some good business decisions and systemic changes in business environment over the past 20 years that have allowed new players onto the scene.  (And a couple of old aristocrats getting VERY lucky that the global rich love London so much).

The tories only focus on deficits/debt because they want to use it as an excuse to cut public services.  They've manipulated the deficit because it's easy to cheat on and makes them look good to people too clueless on economics to know better. It's the usual conservative tactic, cut until the service can't run properly and then claim it's a failure of the public sector and announce privatisation.",null,0,null,1430048116,null,0,false,0,cqp3bh9,null,t3_33wduj,null,t1_cqp3bh9,null,t1_cqp0jjp,null,null,null,1432610749,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

Meanwhile, the individuals that you intend to target (E.g. The so-called ""One Percent"") will just jettison in from Oxford and Birmingham (HS2-pending). They'll be fine over there, if the property tax that you were thinking about only applied in London.

If it's UK-wide, then they can live elsewhere (https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/cheaper-to-live-in-barcelona-and-commute-than-rent-in-london-081937638.html). Free Movement of Persons under EU law allows ease of domicile (In terms of living purposes. Not talking about tax here.).

It would be rational, when your home population continues to disparage and hate, when your politicians continue to use them as a scapegoat, and when the banks are increasingly taxed in an over-regulated environment that has severely damaged the competitiveness of UK investment banks. RBS, Barclays have basically shuttered their IB operations, with RBS pulling out from 33 countries. Barclays fired 15,000 people worldwide in 2012, and RBS have similarly made such arrangements last year/this year.

Populist political pandering to the left is killing off London's viability as the capital of professional services.

In terms of individuals leaving... It's happened in Paris, with the so-called ""One Percent"" of Parisians leaving and living in London (http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b65110d0-d7c2-11e4-849b-00144feab7de.html) due to the 75% tax. ¯\\(ツ)/¯ More revenue for London, I suppose, and more revenue for Barcelona, Paris and Frankfurt if a London/UK-wide tax comes into place.

null,false,PhysS,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"There are two points contained in his argument. The first being that when the government borrows to fund things such as investment (be it infrastructure or financing a short term welfare scheme) it will produce a larger amount of economic output than the input. If the government borrows £20 million to fund a small scheme which encourages people to become skilled in coding and in so doing provides a sizeable pool of programmers the economic gains due to these now skilled workers may be greater than £20 million and the borrowing pays for itself. 

The second point is that government bonds are considered to be extremely safe investments, a country such as Britain is incredibly unlikely to default on them, hence the low rate of interest. Such a low risk asset becomes important in financial markets as collateral and as a hedge against riskier investments. With regulations requiring that certain entities hold low risk investments so as to be better prepared for downturns, government bonds become an integral part of the financial system. If these bonds dried up because the government is reducing it's debt then an important cog in the financial machinery falls out and breaks everything. Assets which are deemed low risk, and so replace government bonds in balance books, may only be low risk during good times and when a downturn hits become valueless.

**tl;dr** The main reasons are: that governments can actually make more money than they borrow if they invest it sensibly and so the borrowing pays for itself; and government bonds are an integral part of the financial system due to their low risk nature and their removal from it would weaken the whole system making it more structurally unsound.

null,false,davegod,uk,United Kingdom,null,"National debt currently around £1.5 trillion^1, equivalent to 80% of our GDP or £50,700 per income tax payer^2. This is after offsetting government investments, including into the banks. This does not count future payments for either state employee pensions or the state pensions (or any other spending commitments). 

The budget deficit for 2014/15 was £87b^1. This was the *increase* in national debt last year. 

The budget deficit comprises a [cyclical and a structural deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_and_cyclical_deficit). The cyclical deficit is okay, it's just a temporary thing because income is lower and expenditure higher while the economy is still a bit weak. The structural deficit however shows we are spending more than we would make even in ""normal"" times. Structural deficit can be split into ""planned"" and ""unplanned"", the former comprises investment into infrastructure which may generate economic benefits and pay for itself over time (like taking out a mortgage on your home, this can be sensible). ""Unplanned"" however is simply spending beyond your means. 

The penalty for the national debt is the interest cost. This results in some combination of higher taxes and/or reduced spending on services. The more you borrow, the more interest you have to pay and hence the harder it becomes to repay debts. The interest for 2014/15 was about half the budget deficit (£46b^1 - though I suspect some of that came back indirectly, as income from the BoE). 

One thing of significant concern is the interest *rate*. We are currently paying a very low interest rate on gilts, which will inevitably rise in future. The higher rates will not only affect new borrowing - government gilts have varied maturities and they routinely have to issue new gilts to pay off old ones.  It is not only about deciding whether we can currently afford to pay the current interest, or even if we can afford to pay current interest on the new borrowing. We are both borrowing more and expecting higher interest rates on the entire principal. 

A further risk is the ""credit rating"". This is usually personified into the credit ratings given by Moody's etc but really we're talking about how much of a premium we need to offer buyers of gilts. We enjoy a very good credit rating which plays a very big role in the low interest rates on the gilts. The rating depends in part on demonstrating control over finances and having a credible plan for repaying debt. That's also obvious to the average voter as basic financial competence anyway, hence the party policies shouting about exactly this. 

But hang on, government spending affects the economy so if we cut spending we reduce the economy. Increasing spending can spur on the economy and end up actually bringing in more than we spent. This is true, but bear in mind structural and cyclical deficits. The ""unplanned"" structural deficit undisputedly has to go, and in the fine print of the party policies this is usually what they are actually talking about. 

The ""pissing contest"" of dating it before the end of the next government term is the parties trying to demonstrate they are committed and willing to be held accountable. Even with the dates we don't really believe them,  but without it'd be like they could barely be bothered to pretend. 

On top of this there are various issues such as the over-spending of the past which gave rise to the deficit being seen as extremely poor stewardship. People are also nervous about potential for future shocks and hence wanting to get back into financial shape to withstand that. On the other hand people also have concerns about either ""hack and slash"" spending cuts or ""tax and spend"", which are more about ideology than sound economic management.

It's obviously impossible to say with certainty how things would have turned out if major events in the past did not occur, but I wager that India would not be as rich and powerful today if colonialism never happened.

Where this is the case they are demanding notice even though the end is automatic, the notice would be meaningless whether given or not.

If it did use some ""notice otherwise new tenancy"" clause etc, it calls into question whether it was ever a fixed term agreement to start with (sounds closer to a longer tenancy but with a break clause of sorts although this might be allowed im not an expert). It just sounds silly for the landlord to be doing that, and stupid for the tenant to accept - just my opinion from what I have learnt in the past though. Like I said, my response assumed it was just an attempt to demand notice for the end of a fiixed term tenancy.

And I wouldnt feel any sympathy, according to places like landlord zone plenty of landlords already s21 people not only be default but at the beginning of the tenancy ready for anytime they need it leaving tenants screwed by even decent landlords.

You can get a train from Edinburgh to Stirling and a bus to Callander, The railway station and the bus station in Stirling are about a three minute walk apart.

First Bus have the X38 to Stirling and from there the 59 to Callander

You can work out a time table from here http://www.travelinescotland.com/welcome.do

Edinburgh Waverley is the main railway station in Edinburgh but if it is more convenient the the train will pass through Haymarket to the west of the city centre.

A taxi from the city centre to Callander will cost £135 and £117 from the airport. You might get a private hire to do the journey for about £100

Doesn't change the fact that Madrid are a better team without Bale than with him, but Ancelotti's obliged to play the guy.

&gt;  The whole argument about Balo not being his signing he should have kicked up a fuss to get someone else, more suited as it was a pretty big fucking risk

We pulled out of the deal for Remy on July 27th; we didn't sign Balotelli until 21st August. That's 3 and a half weeks, how do we know Rodgers didn't kick up a fuss throughout those 3 and a half weeks for the committee to come up with a better option? In the end, with 10 days to go in the window, the committee comes back and says ""Sorry Brendan, it's Eto'o or Balotelli"" - I'm not criticising Rodgers anymore at that point, I'm fuming at the ineptitude of this so-called 'committee'.

When this overall majority doesn't happen, he will expect the (usually inevitable) jeering over his failure to be set aside as the minor parties come to him on their knees, begging him to make a deal with them to keep the Tories out, who will, in all probability, have more seats again, but again, not enough to form a government.

* This draws a line under the Tories major line of attack right now.
* There will be some voters in Scotland who *might* return to labour because of this. (Though personally I doubt it will alter the overall trend that labour are defeated there).

So the SNP can now either tacitly approve a labour administration or block it and in turn end up installing a Tory government by proxy - or force another vote in which they can at best sustain their current position or lose seats, since they have no scope to gain more seats.

Well that's quite selfish of you. As I said, I don't think it should be banned but just because you legally can do something doesn't mean you should. In this case, Charlie Hebdo used offensive cartoons as a cynical, money-making tool.

&gt;you said 'offensive to ethnic minorities' as though every person with a particular skin color or religion shares the same view about what is or isn't offensive.

Those pictures are offensive to a number of ethnic minorities, if not most of the ethnic minorities in France. Don't try and twist my words.

That is a part of living in an open society, but that doesn't mean that you should alienate people unnecessarily, and that's all this is. Charlie Hebdo helps nobody and its images ONLY serve to cause offence, which actively contributes to social stigma. Is it their right? Yes. Should they be doing it? No.

Nope. That's where the misunderstanding lies. The SNP now have 3 options;

* 1) Vote for a labour Queens speech even though there will be no concessions on offer from labour in exchange for it.
* 2) Vote down a labour Queens speech and accept a tory minority government they vowed to block... and get annihilated by voters in Scotland for making such a U-turn.
* 3) Vote down **both** labour and tory Queens speechs and force another election. Since the SNP look set to win almost all the seats in Scotland, if there is another election they can at best keep their current seats - or more likely stand to lose some of them... so basically their only position is down.

Basically Miliband has just thrown down to Nicola Stugeon. Whatever she does she stands to lose face over it. The SNP are now in the tough position of being forced to play Kingmaker in an arrangement where they stand to get nothing at all. 

I don't agree with the other poster who argues labour will simply reverse on this after the election. To do that will be electoral suicide for labour in England, where the SNP are unpopular. To put it into context, if Miliband now forms a confidence and supply deal with the SNP it will make him one of the biggest liars in British political history in the eyes of the electorate. It will make Nick Cleggs famous tuition fees U-turn look like a cheeky little fib. 

As I see it, Labour have nothing to lose by doing this. As I posted elsewhere;

* English and Welsh voters are still going to vote Labour anyway. 
* There is a remote chance this might cause a small swing back to labour in Scotland - where they are finished anyway so have nothing to lose by trying. 
* It seriously hurts the Conservatives current line of attack against the ""dangers of an SNP-led Labour government"" in England. 

Honestly, I think from a strategic point of view this is arguably one of the smartest things Miliband has done to date. He has nothing to lose and everything to gain from it. 

----------

&gt; If they do support it, Labour would have a minority government without any deal with the SNP, and would definitely be in a shaky position

Even with SNP support labour are looking at a *""majority""* (if you can even call it that) of about 330 seats. Hardly safe. It was always going to be shakey. The last time a government had such a thin margin was probably back in the late 1970s when a few deaths, defections and resignations erroded the margin and allowed a woman called Margret Thatcher to force a no confidence vote. She won it (ironically with SNP support) and the rest is history.",null,0,null,1430053828,null,0,1430054094,0,cqp4tpu,null,t3_33wyd2,null,t1_cqp4tpu,null,t3_33wyd2,null,null,null,1432611529,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

Your literal argument is ""we must ignore white terrorists"". There have been others. Remember this (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Norway_attacks). There have been white terrorists. 

Your argument is ridiculous. You are comparing a SINGLE article pointing out that the response to white terrorists is a measured and sane response while every single minority lives in fear of the backlash (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Balbir_Singh_Sodhi). No one's going to racially profile white people. And most minorities know this. 

Let's look at the recent plane crash from German Wings. The pilot had this incredible back story fleshed out about how and why he did it. Really? If he was called Abdullah we would have gone ""Terrorist"" and just ignored anything else. Why? We did the same for Sunil. He was humanised and we wanted to discuss ""mental health issues"" after this and make it easier for pilots to seek medical help. Had he been  Muslim it would have become harder for Muslims across the western world to get employment. 

What? Saudi Arabia are one of the biggest sponsors of Al-Qaeda. Seriously? Al-Shabab were born out of the export of Saudi Shariah to Somalia. In general we don't bomb Saudi because we like their oil. 

And are you high? A huge amount of civlians are killed. Do you know how to hit a terrorist in NWFP in Pakistan? You go to the NWFP and throw a rock. Anyone it hits? Is a terrorist. (Everyone is armed). 

Are you daft, the war on terror destabilised Iraq and started a civil war which has left close to 200,000 people dead. That is on our hands. ISIL's massacres are on our hands since Saddam would have stopped that. Our policy of ""De Baathification"" was idiotic because we fired their high ranking military officials (along with state engineers, doctors and teachers) so left an Iraqi army in the hands of leaders who were untested and ISIL took advantage of that. 

And this is without the collateral damage of attacks. The majority of people killed in Iraq were not terrorists. It literally was ""Let us invade a country, Let us Not Leave. People now want us to go away. These people are violent. Therefore they are terrorists""

The last attack on US soil that could be considered terrorism by us? A political Murder is all you need right?

The SNP are now in the tough position of being forced to play Kingmaker in an arrangement where they stand to get nothing at all.


The answer will be Option 1: but it's not the disadvantage to the SNP you image it to be.

Yes, the SNP will vote for Labour's Queen's Speech, and so long as Labour want to implement policies the SNP support (and that'll be quite a lot given the similarity in manifestos) then they'll get support even without a deal. 

But the SNP manifesto has been designed this way for a purpose. It'll result in 1) A stable UK government, which, consequently, 2) will give Scottish voters no reason to vote Scottish Labour (possibly ever again, but especially in Holyrood 2016). 

If Labour want to do something else outside of common manifesto pledges, a deal will need to be struck.  Voting down an individual bill won't be a problem for the SNP - they can safely do that without brining down the government. Furthermore, Labour won't want to be seen as fragile - they'll have another election to win in 5 years time and will be guaranteed to lose if the government falls before then. 

The SNP will happily table amendments to Labour bills (e.g., an £8.70 minimum wage, rather than the £8; devolution of the minimum wage), and if voted down will still be able to support the Labour bill while claiming Labour ""aren't progressive enough, but it's better than nothing"". 

 It'll get interesting if the SNP campaign for Holyrood next year on extensive devolution. That'll be a strong mandate for their MP bloc to work with.  Westminster can implement it, or ignore it at their peril. Either way the SNP, who are back to playing the long game, will win.

This spurs from the ""standing up for the little guy"" ethos of left-wing politics, when the workers unionised and fought back against the capitalists (that is to say, exploitative business owners). Previously it was about solidarity for working people, now it's about defending the underrepresented and marginalised (disabled people, difference race and religious groups etc.). Totally abandoning the former has been justified under the banner of progressive economic liberalism but it is incompatible with left-wing ideals in it's current form.

The left doesn't defend Islam ""so much"". It's just terrified of the people shouting ""Racist"", so it panders to them. Most Muslims want to come here and have peaceful lives without changing their culture. This is where tensions are rising because unless their specific brand of Islam is espousing the virtues of integration then we're just going to see increasing divisions. It comes down to social hegemonies in the places where these immigrants are living and the sense of 'belonging' to a specific community or identity. Letting them in and making no effort to integrate them means they end generally up in socially and economically deprived communities which do not reflect British values. It's a complicated issue which has been deliberately ignored.

I also agree with the fact that we do not have contingency plans, but think about it between Sanchez and Balo we had 3 weeks. Do you not think that the committee didnt consider options such as Lacazette, Higuain, Cavani... no other striker [proven or mature] was available for us within our price range for transfer fee. I cant think of one anyway!


But realistically what can we change. Our first/second choice targets are always quite high, i.e. Sanchez, Willian, Remy, Costa, Siquiera, Mikhtaryan... We can pay the wages if we REALLY want them. We are even willing to pay most transfer fees. The change is that other clubs seem more attractive. Simple as that... as a result we end up being the leverage for them getting a better deal.


To make us seem more attractive we either get CL, pay astronomical wages or get a highly charismatic manager with a solid reputation... Or we can wait until BR [great manager IMO] matures himself along with the club and gains experience, goes on to win trophies and then can buy the top quality players. That won't be for another 6-8 years [around 3-4 for players to mature and assuming at least 50% stay, and then another 2-4 years for him to gain experience]

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"&gt; Either way the SNP, who are back to playing the long game, will win. 

Maybe, maybe not. Who knows where people will be in 10-20 years when independence might be back on the table. Until then Westminster has enough of a democratic mandate to block any attempts at another referendum or succession. The other issue is that independence still remains inextricably tied to the SNP. If Westminster can portray the SNP as an ineffective party then they also hurt the cause of independence. The bottom line is even if voters went back to the polls today for another referendum the outcome is far from certain. The economic arguments that ultimately cost the Yes campaign victory are every bit as much of an issue now as they were 9 months ago - perhaps even more so with the dwindling value of oil.

&gt; It'll get interesting if the SNP campaign for Holyrood next year on extensive devolution. That'll be a strong mandate for their MP bloc to work with

This is true. Having said that I think Scots might be surprised to find that both Tory and labour governments broadly support more devolution. Their thought process is that if Holyrood is made responsible for both taxation and spending it will be harder for a single party like the SNP to simply seize a majority. I mean it's virtually unheard of in a modern democracy to have a single party win 100% of the seats available - and an inward looking Scotland might find a more competitive domestic political arena opens up if taxation powers are handled domestically. 

To put it into an example; Westminster doesn't like that the SNP can spend money on free childcare and win voters because of it, but Westminster has to raise taxes through unpopular methods (like the Bedroom Tax) in order to pay for it. The idea is this would force the incumbent government in Holyrood to make tough choices, which in turn would alter the political composition of Scotland.

What Labour have to lose is essentially Scotland.

I think it's a mistake to think the SNP's goal in this election is to be the power behind the throne at Westminster.

Scottish Labour have long campaigned on ""Vote SNP, Get Tory"", and the SNP's goal is simply to neuter the idea that if Scotland votes for the SNP it gets a Conservative government.

Scotland voted Labour last time and got a Conservative government so that attack was already pretty shaky, if it votes SNP this time and gets a Labour government then that argument's dead and buried. The ""concessions"" they want from Labour are nothing more than the devolution promises that were made pre-referendum.

If those get delivered then the SNP will take the credit for holding Labour's feet to the fire, if those don't get delivered the SNP get to point to Westminster parties breaking their promises to Scotland.

This is intended effect. This frees up the land in areas where it is needed. A owner will have three choices: Sell it off, demolish it and rebuild, or renovate it.

&gt;The problem with house building is planning permission. It's so hard to get permission to build in the UK that a whole parasitic industry has developed whose sole competency is to negotiate the horrendous red tape. They call themselves ""house builders"", but the actual design and construction of quality homes is a secondary part of their business - as you can tell from the low quality, uninspiring, mass produced crap that most people in the UK live in. The ""new town"" approach is designed to prop up these useless businesses.

Planning permissions are a pain in arse but they can be useful. How do you plan to scale it back? It'd be really stupid to completely demolish it. 

New towns are better since you get a chance to completely start over. You can plan everything right from sewerage to transport infrastructure and to houses. Problem with overcrowding in trains? Plan it so it doesn't happen. Roads suck? Plan it. Parking in your house sucks? Plan it. Etc.

Green belts exist for a reason. It can get pretty depressing if all you see is built up areas going from London to Birmingham on a train. It also prevents overcrowding in cities. Imagine London but 2x larger. Transport infrastructure couldn't handle it.

It couldn't be as unpopular as the Lib Dems, whom everyone thought of as left-of-centre, jumping into bed with the Tories last time around. Compared to that, two ""socialist"" parties clubbing together seems rather tame.

Ironically, by constantly harping on about how the SNP would ""destroy the country"" if they were in government, the Tories are driving an even bigger wedge between Scottish and English people. Not such a good move to make if their concern is *really* about ""keeping the union together"" and not just hanging onto power by any means necessary.

2. He was consistent last season, but not this year defensively. Also, criticism is not fishing for karma, get over it. 99% of my criticism this year has been on this subreddit. If I was fishing for karma, I'd post in every post match thread on /r/soccer, but I didn't. I don't think he was fine, but you're entitled to your opinion.

3. Just because it's the tactics, doesn't mean he's immune from criticism. If a manager instructs a winger who's better cutting in and scoring to stay wide and only whip in crosses (which in this hypothetical he's bad at), you put the majority blame to the tactics or manager, but that doesn't mean you're not allowed to criticize this winger for being a poor crosser. Stop fucking patronizing me. I know the role of a fullback is to attack and they often get caught. The difference is most fullbacks have the pace to get back to at least help on counters. Ivanovic is a CB turned into RB and it shows in that transition back. Also, stop with this dumb shifting the blame onto me. ""Well can you do it? Then shut up!"" is the laziest argument ever. Some of the best managers in the history either haven't played football, didn't make it professionally or weren't very good. Just because I couldn't do it (I never played outside of CB because I have asthma), doesn't mean I'm not allowed to criticize.

That's only a tiny fraction of the population, and one that's not important enough to veto the whole idea.

Any land-value tax will be self-righting in the end, it won't add whatever% to the market price it'll be baked-in to the market price.  But it will encourage a kind of churn in high-value areas; people will be less likely to hold empty property as a store-of-value, and for others (retirees etc.) it'll be an incentive to downsize and vacate the area.

Whether it worked or not depends mostly on setting it at the right rate.  I'd like to see it as a percentage of the value gained since the previous transaction, someone buying a house today would pay no land-value tax, but someone who lives next-door and bought it in 1993 will be paying 3% of £££,£££.

The way to beat the park the bus teams is not through the air, because as Real Madrid found many many times against Atletico, their main strength is in the air (hence why they squeeze the middle of the pitch and allow the flanks to be free, thus inviting the opponent to get crosses in which they can easily deal with).

You need to be direct, have good dribblers and force yourself into the middle with the purpose of beating a man or getting free kicks/penalties (which is why Barca don't struggle as much as Real do against Atletico, they have great 1v1 Dribblers that can force something to happen). Furthermore, driving into the middle can cause panic if the player evades a couple of challenges, which causes the CB to move up and stop him, then getting the fullbacks moving across and creating space and then you can get overlaps occurring.

Ironically, the Liverpool team of last year dealt with many teams that parked the bus. Suarez, Sterling and Coutinho could dribble the way through the opponents. Nowadays, we've got Sterling wide, which doesn't help, Suarez is gone and just Coutinho playing with strikers that don't make runs (Balotelli and Lambert).

The defensive counter attack is perhaps the most successful system in lots of sports. From Mayweather to Mourinho, there has been lots of winners benefiting from it. It's also the quickest and easiest system to implement.

1. Circulate the ball very quickly to pull players out of shape and then attack the space created

3. Have fullbacks with excellent dribbling ability who can beat opposing defenders 1-v-1, and then either get to the byline and cut the ball back, or drill in crosses in the space between the CB's and the keeper where players tend to hesitate.

4. Have players with great close control/dribbling/hold-up play; players who can retain the ball in tight spaces

5. Set pieces

Last season, we did #4 and #5, and sometimes #1. Barcelona and Arsenal do #1, #3 and #4.

We bought Lambert to help do #2 &amp; #4; Lallana helps with #4 as well, which is why he looked more threatening against West Brom than most of our other players. 

Balotelli should help with #2 and #4, but nobody knows how to play off of him, and it's been a long while since we've had a fullback with consistently good delivery.

I didn't mean to imply that they will win in the long run, just that they'll win in the context of ""whatever constitutional arrangement emerges after this election"" - or rather, whatever happens during the next parliamentary term, the SNP will be able to spin it in their favour.

&gt;  Until then Westminster has enough of a democratic mandate to block any attempts at another referendum or succession.

I don't expect the SNP to pull a trigger until the point where the polls indicate a significant pro-independence majority (say, 60%) - but, in any case, blocking a referendum which is Westminster's right, might not be that great a long term strategy. However, it's somewhat irrelevant at the moment. I don't think we'll be revisiting this till 2021 at the earliest.

&gt;  Having said that I think Scots might be surprised to find that both Tory and labour governments broadly support more devolution. Their thought process is that if Holyrood is made responsible for both taxation and spending it will be harder for a single party like the SNP to simply seize a majority. 

I'm not sure this really matches the reality of the situation. The SNP want to develop a path towards fiscal autonomy and neither the Tories or Labour are prepared to support or deliver it. Already Labour and the SNP are criticising the Tories for breaking their Smith commission commitments to further devolution. Still, we shall see what the next parliament brings. 

I think more correctly, the Tories and Labour are supportive of the *minimum* amount of devolution that they think will be enough to placate the electorate (again, see the Smith commission - especially Labour's alleged backtracking over the final 24 hours). 

&gt;  Their thought process is that if Holyrood is made responsible for both taxation and spending it will be harder for a single party like the SNP to simply seize a majority.

&gt; Their thought process is that if Holyrood is made responsible for both taxation and spending it will be harder for a single party like the SNP to simply seize a majority.

Proportional Representation makes it hard for a single party to ""seize"" a majority anyway, however I expect we'll see another couple of SNP, SNP/Green arrangements at Holyrood before there's a chance of the other parties catching up. It doesn't seem a realistic proposition before 2026 (although things can always change). 

&gt; To put it into an example; Westminster doesn't like that the SNP can spend money on free childcare and win voters because of it, but Westminster has to raise taxes through unpopular methods (like the Bedroom Tax) in order to pay for it. 

It's a poor choice of example, as the SNP government mitigates the effect of the Bedroom Tax in full out of the block grant, so nobody in Scotland is affected by it. However I see the general point you're making...

However, I go back to my previous point; I don't think you're right. Westminster doesn't want Holyrood to have the ability to freely raise its own taxes (and has resisted it at every turn), because it then potentially sets up internal competition within Britain. There's also the argument that says the more power Holyrood holds, the ""less scary"" the prospect of independence becomes.  The paucity of tax powers in the Smith Commission command paper (which has already been watered down) would seem to bear that out.

My SO and I don't do that, we live in a 3 bed house with a gas boiler, gas cooker and gas boiler and were estimated £90 a month direct debit, instead we get an accurate metered bill every 3 months and pay that. 

We put aside £100 a month each for water, electricity/gas, house insurance, internet/phone and £100 a month each for food. The actual bill values of these are £32, £75, £10, £28. So far this has worked out well, we've got a bit of a surplus going, which was is useful for when unexpected bills (like car tax) come up it also means we can pay for things like insurance upfront so it's cheaper rather than monthly. 

Is there any other income expected apart from the £1300? I know you aren't including the student loans in those numbers.

Sure, it is obviously a limiting factor, but if everyone expected to finish exactly where, on paper, they should, sport would be incredibly boring and lack ambition.

So yes, we are a '5th team' so we made 5th, great, so we have been, at best, average; we have not excelled and we have not (apparently) underperformed. 

That's all well and good for teams who are happy to play within their means and are happy where they, but we would surely have a little more ambition than that.

The thing the SNP want the most is to maintain power in Scotland, and maintain their hold over Scottish politics. So to just be seen as blocking the Tories from power by allowing a Labour government to pass legislation will be enough to achieve that goal.

Recent examples that come to mind:

- Michu to Swansea, cost 2m, never played in EPL before, scored 22 goals in his first season.
- Graziano Pelle, cost 8m, never played in EPL before, currently on 15 goals.
- Diafra Sakho, undisclosed minor fee, never played in EPL before, currently on 10 goals.

All three players moved to a new club, in a new league, to be managed under a new coach. NOBODY is saying 110m should have solved everything, but it hasn't even solved **a quarter of the fucking goal deficit**. 

I'd like to make it clear that I don't have a problem with Rodgers, but people need to wake up a little before they banging on about how incredible our signings of (for example) Markovic and Lallana have been. They'll come good, I have no doubt, but something in the scouting/recruiting part of our club is seriously fucked up. 110 million is more than enough to reinforce a squad, as most clubs seem capable of doing it for much less.

They still offer to sell you a ticket but if the engineering for goes forward then part of the journey will be be replacement bus service. Which kind of defeats the faster train journey. You might as will get the cheaper normal bus service.

If you try to buy tickets on the Friday 29th there is no mention of possible engineering works, if if you are travelling on the Friday it looks like you only have to worry about the return journey.

However I should say that taxis in Callander will run on a lower tariff than the ones in Edinburgh  so if you want to do the direct transport then they will  cheaper. I would expect that they will want you to pay most if not all of the fare by card in advance to protect them for the problem of them sending a vehicle to Edinburgh and you not bothering to turn up.

It's because they know it's not a positive character trait mate. I've been encountering this phenomenon for years with reds outside Manchester.

You'd meet them on holiday, get talking football, and they'd be from Essex/Belfast/Kent/London/Cornwall/Wales. You'd rib them a bit and ask them why they support United, and there'd always be some kind of limp attempt at justification: ""my dad/grandad/brother/uncle/cousin was/is from Manchester"", ""X Y or Z was my favourite player and it picked up from there"" etc.

You'd never hear someone just be frank and say it was because they're the top side in the country. There always has to be an 'excuse'. Because everyone knows, such shallow and needy character traits are regarded with disdain - especially by real football supporters whose motivations for supporting their club are actually genuine.

People like me are really militant about this though, because we grew up when City were yo-yoing through the divisions and United were the strongest side in the country. There's nothing that could breed a greater contempt for gloryhunters than that.

If everyone thought like a gloryhunter then City would've ceased to exist in the 90s. Our attendances certainly wouldn't have averaged 30k in 98.

But now we're among the big boys and we're sufficiently glamorous for the gloryhunters to jump aboard and claim undying loyalty?

Really knocks me sick, I won't lie.

But I try not to make it personal, and I know it comes with the territory. Each to their own I suppose. A sure fire way to stir me up though is for a new bandwagon blue to tell me that their support of City is no different to mine or yours.

You can get instant access cash ISA's and fixed rate cash ISA's.

&gt;Exaro can reveal that the six “key findings” of the medical evidence, as summarised by the DPP in her statement just over a week ago were not all agreed by the four experts who gave assessments for the case.

&gt;A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) admitted that not all the experts agreed on all six points, saying that the findings were a combination of assessments by the four.

I really don't think that having all of the empty houses demolished is the end game you were reaching for.

Also, you've completely ignored my point that there just aren't enough empty houses to make a big difference.

&gt; Planning permissions are a pain in arse but they can be useful.
&gt; It can get pretty depressing if all you see is built up areas going from London to Birmingham on a train.

British people do love looking at their sterile industrialised farmland. This attitude really frustrates me, especially when it comes from the urban left wingers.

The British countryside used to be full of life. Full of people. Poor people. In the 18th Century, the wealthy elite stole their land - our land, often with violence, and forced them all to move into the cities. They then got all romantic and wrote poetry about how empty and bucolic the countryside was.

To this day, we have an incredibly empty countryside. That's not its natural state. If you go to other European countries, where there were no clearances you find a much more human pattern of development. Villages are walking distance from each other. They are populated vibrant places with actual people living and working in them. If you pay attention, you can see the bleached bones of the *real* English countryside as you travel around. Tiny hamlets with just a farmstead or a couple of houses. Or place names that survive on maps or signposts, but with no surviving buildings, perhaps just a mill pond.

Do the descents of those dispossessed people rage at their exclusion from the land of their ancestors? No, they've adopted the attitude of the elite - that the countryside is much better without all of those messy little people. It's ironic and tragic in equal measure.

This further highlights how the term is used by different parties to mean different things as per my earlier post. Likewise if you go back to the other end of the spectrum, you see people laughing off the word because they consider it to mean Islam should be given special treatment (and that should never be the case) which means the real issues are effectively laughed off too.

In my opinion the term should be irrelevant, we should identify the key issues and try to solve them. The key issue here is not satirical cartoons or religious debates offending Muslims, it is that all Muslims are tarred with the same brush by a section of society and this leads to hate crime, discrimination based on religion and colour etc. ",null,0,null,1430061368,null,0,false,0,cqp7tx4,null,t3_33wqmc,null,t1_cqp7tx4,null,t1_cqp74r9,null,null,null,1432612945,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Ultimately it's a choice.  You don't want to intervene militarily? Well you better take more refugees than those who do. 

This is very relevant to my own country. We contributed about 0.1% as much as Denmark did in Afghanistan. Nothing in Libya, and we aren't in the anti-ISIS coalition. It's unfair to expect the Danes to have to then help even more with refugees.

If Italy goes and establishes a peaceable democratic regime in Eritrea, ending the flow of refugees, why should they have to host more of the remaining ones? Contributions should be relatively equal.

Sort of. But you have to understand where our Western religious tolerance comes from: It's our response to *centuries* of bloody religious conflict. Look at how divided Northern Ireland still is to this day. The whole of Europe was like that from the Protestant reformation right up until the Enlightenment. Terrible wars wracked the continent. Whole populations were slaughtered. We invented the concept of the nation state, just to provide a framework for keeping the warring sides apart.

Eventually, religious tolerance emerged as a way of stopping the violence.

Today, the idea that religion is a personal matter is so ingrained in our thinking that it seems axiomatic. We just cannot comprehend how normal it is for Muslims to feel that the state should reflect their religious views.

Of course today, it's Islam that is riven by factional violence and slaughter.

This way, they get to make more money from ""lazy"" consumers who were attracted by the initial good deal but can't be bothered to monitor the situation or change. You should generally plan to review the situation in each case at least once a year, or when it comes up for renewal.

Interest rates are low right now but if you haven't been keeping on top of your deal there, chances are it's a bad one even in this market.

If you're not likely to use all your ISA allowance in subsequent years, you might get a better deal (even after tax) from a high-interest savings accounts and/or regular saver accounts that even the best available cash ISAs. Check out the comparisons on Money Saving Expert.

Section 2 of the Act also provides for two ways in which a general election can be held before the end of this five-year period:

* **If the House of Commons resolves ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government"", an early general election is held**, unless the House of Commons subsequently resolves ""That this House has confidence in Her Majesty's Government"". This second resolution must be made within fourteen days of the first.
* If the House of Commons, with the support of two-thirds of its total membership (including vacant seats), resolves ""That there shall be an early parliamentary general election"".

If they voted down both the Con and Lab legislative programme and didn't retract their intentions within 14 days there would indeed be a new general election.

Pretty soon the police and the ambulance turned up, went in and took a guy out whose head was smoothed in white stuff, he was the one making all the noise and they ambulance staff seemed very panicked. Five minutes later another guy was brought out, shirt off, eyeballs popping out of his skull, cuffed at the wrists, behind his back.

Turns out that one guy was smoking crack, and would not share or give a hit to this other chap who was hanging out at Bills. Thus disgruntled chap went out the of room, into the Kitchen and boiled the kettle. Came back into the other room and emptied the boiling water onto the other chaps head.

That was how I remember Brixton. It was just a cat and mouse game between Police and psychotic dealers from Jamaica + all the crack / smack heads they served.

Why do conversations about have to descend into petty remarks like this? It doesn't help. By all means say you disagree and why but we can do without this.

&gt;Brendan is a young manager who despite all odds nearly won us our first title in 25 YEARS IN HIS SECOND SEASON. Considering we were up against rich clubs such as Chelsea and City who have squads overflowing with quality that is spectacular.

True but a lot of people would say having one of the best players in the world banging in goals was a major factor in that. What would you say to that?

I think Rodgers has done good things - there's no doubt about it but the Klopp op seems irresistible. He is considered to be one of the top managers in the world. We'd be lucky to get a manager like that and there seems that there is a possibility of it. How often will a chance like that come around? He said he wants to manage a club and beat bigger teams that have lots of money. 

How many other world-class managers have that outlook? Maybe Benitez. But he's been there - done that. I think Klopp might be hungry to prove himself in the Premier League.

Rodgers was an improvement for us when he came to Anfield. If there is a chance we can improve further then why not?",null,0,null,1430063748,null,0,false,0,cqp8zwf,null,t3_33wq8w,null,t1_cqp8zwf,null,t1_cqp2z4r,null,null,null,1432613494,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

&gt;They're always going to compete with United because of their money, he doesn't want Liverpool coming and using champions league to attract better players and make his life harder.

We finished second in the league and had Champions League when United didn't - so that doesn't really add up.

Now, of course, Labour could play hardball and not enter into discussions with anybody and try again with the same legislative programme - but much would depend on whether or not they could afford to run an election campaign / hope to win the next election / think the SNP are bluffing.

Much would also depend on what the sticky issue is, and what the public opinion surrounding that issue is. I think that most people who think Labour will take a ""vote us down if you dare"" attitude towards the SNP don't consider that such a move, while inevitably damaging to the SNP, could also be very damaging to Labour - it plays right into the Tories hands.

As I've said elsewhere, I don't expect such a situation to arise when it comes to the Queen's Speech or the budget, but the SNP will have no problem voting down any legislation that doesn't appear in its manifesto if there is no attempt at a compromise.",null,0,null,1430064571,null,0,1430064859,0,cqp9evo,null,t3_33wusi,null,t1_cqp9evo,null,t1_cqp8h2y,null,null,null,1432613691,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

I'd give the guy above the benefit of the doubt, when he said 'a fan is a fan it makes no difference'.... I was guessing (well, hoping) that he's just saying as long as he supports the club it doesn't really matter - unless the lads actually mental then I really don't think he's saying he's equal in terms of support to someone who started going to Maine road in the 50's. I'm not going to read too much into the pricing fans out comment, because without direct quotes I can't really have a go. Obviously that's ridiculous if true.

Supporting City doesn't have to be a dick-waving contest. I'm sure I could find plenty of matches I've been to which you haven't, making me the 'better fan', and certainly vice versa. But why should I give a fuck. As long as you (or anyone) supports the club and don't act like a twat, regardless of where you're from or why you started supporting them, then I respect that. We can't have all been raised in Moss Side/Fallowfield by fanatical city-supporting dads.

Obviously there are problems where new fans think they have more say/knowledge/right to be a city fan than oldtimers, but that's always the case - in the same way I wouldn't start going on at my dad about how he's not as good as a fan as me even though he was going to Maine rd 30 years before I was. But for the most part the newcomers aren't like that, there are plenty open for a good chat about the subject, you've just got to wade through the few knobheads first.

null,false,godsayshi,null,null,null,"I think it is wrong to say that genetics should always be dismissed because Nazis. This is guilt by association and the punishment is ignorance. I consider this behaviour even more abhorrent than holocaust denial. Dysgenetics and eugentics are both sound theories but extremely difficult to really measure and put into practice. More often than not the cure is worse than the disease or the diagnosis/cure is quack science altogether. In that field, when dealing with humans there is rarely more that can be done than to guesstimate. Such concepts are the film Ideocracy and influence others such as Wall-E. Most of us consider it pointless to really worry about in the long future because genetic engineering will address the problem anyway. To make another film reference, a future scenario like that in Gattaca is more likely. Personally, I also find the idea that perhaps many many thousands of years in the future a country's policy could eventually lead people to devolve into ape like creatures if left sufficiently isolated an amusing one. Epigenetics also has some basis in fact but again it is extremely hard to really measure or determine the real effect of it. Even genetic temperament is a real phenomenon. He could actually be somewhat correct but it's not easy to prove. It's also potentially a lot more arbitrary and harder to predict than some might imagine. Evolution is naive. WW1 may well have caused a significant epigenetic effect but this could have been any effect, even one that would seem counter intuitive. It's a nice notion that epigenetics could have a faster impact than conventional dysgenetics/eugenetics/POE but it is wrong to make wild guesses about what that impact might be or to overstate its impact.

In the short term a ""genetic"" effect that fits better would be the widespread cultural phenomenons that impact the minds of people to the effect of creating societal memory. What a mother actually tells her children when raising them would likely have a far bigger effect. The report looks like the result of blurred vision and contains many extreme simplifications. He leaves many other things out that can cause an effect and over-presents epigenetics. I do wonder if that's really what he is talking about or if he's misappropriating terminology.

War today for many is pointless. The meme ""World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones."" is widespread and very well known. Such a life style no longer brings many of the benefits it once used to. On the other hand, making a living in subjects such as art is easier today than it ever was. There was once a time very few could get their hands on painting equipment for example. Another common meme is that ""It's impossible to starve in this country."". Although some of these meme might have a historical origin what they really refer to is the contemporary situation which arguably has a more significant impact than anything else.

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"I disagree. Look the NHS can be improved. But we are going about it the wrong way. 

Patient satisfaction has taken a front seat to good outcomes so a lot of our spending is on things that are a bit daft. We can cut costs through efficiency rather than through just burning money. First hit the standard, then make people laugh. In fact hitting the first will make the second slide into place a lot more easily.

Let's look at a simple saving. The waste of cash in A&amp;E by people who don't need an A&amp;E. How can we improve it? More education in schools about what is worth going to hospital. What have we done instead? We spent money on stop gap measures. 

Another? GPs. Let us look at something quite ""unknown"" among the public. You know a lot of doctors are Asian right? In University these doctors score very highly in written exams but when it comes to Viva they score low. So they often have much higher failure rates than White candidates. Except? Most don't have any problem with the skills being tested. A catheter insertion is a catheter insertion world wide. I still drape, clean and insert a catheter the same way in the UK as I do in India. So there must be another reason. The scoring of Viva/practicals/OSCE are subjective. There is an actual bias. Incidentally? If two doctors are punished for the same issue, the Asian doctor is punished in a much harsher way. Basically? The biggest single demography in the UK that provides doctors to the NHS are Asians and they are one of the most discriminated groups within the medical system as staff. This costs us a lot of money in wasted doctors, in pointless law suits and loss of staff. We are desperate for GPs but we are marking people who WANT to be GPs much more harshly and expecting them to jump through way more hoops.

Student Loans. Medical Student loans are enormous. Think of it this way. It's close to 70 to 100 K of debt. Doctors are forced to be money minded since they have that much debt on their hands when they start off. 

We have problems inside the NHS. Of efficiency, equality and how to run our hospitals so that the staff feel valued. So much emphasis has been placed on patients that we have forgotten about loyalty to the people who work for the NHS too. 

You can  run the system for cheap if you simply cut the bits where we are bloated for no reason. Yes, some patients will have more discomfort but I am afraid we are going to have to grin and bear it. If you can do the same job for less resources we should. In some cases we can do a better job... the example I love was that some Welsh hospitals were paying 10 quid for a loaf of gluten free bread for patients with dietary restrictions. Something that should cost a quid. 

Oh and a simple fix to the A&amp;E problem? The total cost of A&amp;E is high, a simple fix  would be to have a GP within A&amp;E being paid the full GP contract allowing them to see walk in patients who aren't emergencies or injuries. These don't go on the record if they are minor. If it is a long term condition, the hospital informs the GP practice about the issue and care is routed through there rather than the hospital out of hours GP.

Thirteen years of occupation later, the US-led coalition and Afghan security forces had battled insurgents in practically every region of strategic importance. Extravagantly wasteful spending and seemingly limitless corruption has left the elected government treading a rocky path after the handover of security responsibility last December.

*10. The $37m border bridge enabling bulk opium and heroin exports*

&gt; In mid-2007, the US Army Corps of Engineers completed a 700m x 11m concrete bridge across the muddy waters of the River Panj, which divides Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The ""bridge of friendship"" was inaugurated by leaders of both countries in a ribbon-cutting ceremony, where talk was of establishing the last missing link of the ancient silk road.

&gt; The $37 million gift replaced an unreliable ferry service across the fast-flowing river, promising to boost trade between these poor Central Asian nations, lifting economies throughout the region. Two years of construction would guarantee decades of cheaper exports, ensuring abundant timber and vegetables for growing population centers.

&gt; It would also greatly increase the scope of drug trafficking from Afghanistan through to Russia and Western Europe. Before, only a few dozen vehicles crossed the river daily. Now, hundreds of trucks potentially loaded with opium and heroin are ushered across by bribed border officials each week, with no US or Nato involvement on either side.

*9. Nato forces supplying food, water and arms to Taliban forces*

&gt; Since Taliban insurgents do not carry membership cards, and blend seamlessly into the general population, it might be expected that the odd box of supplies intended for Afghan security forces would occasionally fall into their hands.

&gt; On one occasion in 2008, Nato admitted accidentally dropping pallets laden with ammunition, rocket-propelled grenades, food and water into Taliban-controlled territory in Southern Afghanistan. The containers were destined for local police forces in a remote region, but grid references were allegedly confused by helicopter pilots.

&gt; Many Afghan officials believed it was no accident, prompting a Nato spokesperson in Brussels to assure that efforts were being made to ""get the message across that we do not deliberately supply the Taliban with arms.""

&gt; The rumor of US support for the Taliban was extremely popular in Kabul, the capital. It was baffling how a great superpower could fail so spectacularly to wipe out the insurgency.

*8. The British plan to run a Taliban training camp for 2,000 fighters*

&gt; Incredibly, a British plan was in motion to provide military training for 1,800 Taliban fighters and 200 low-level commanders, in a purpose-built camp constructed at a cost of $125k, and with a further $200k earmarked to run it for the subsequent year.

&gt; The plan was discovered by Afghan secret police on a memory stick seized in December 2007. According to an Afghan government source, the goal was to encourage the Taliban recruits to ""swap sides"" and fight insurgents, but Afghans feared the British would create a militia ""with no loyalty to the central government"", and the plan was ditched.

&gt; A second proposed function of the camp was to train the Taliban in farming and irrigation techniques, with the hope of encouraging alternatives to growing opium. Afghan government staff also claimed the memory stick revealed plans to train the Taliban to use secure satellite phones in order to communicate with UK officials.

&gt; UK and UN officials confirmed the outline of the British-led plan, but refused to talk about it on the record.

*7. The US paying $150 million to companies accused of financing insurgents*

&gt; In 2013, John F. Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR) used data from classified Pentagon reports and the Commerce Department to compile a list of 43 companies with ""terrorist links"" which had been given contracts by the US Army.

&gt; One of those listed was a road construction firm which the US said is partly owned by the Haqqanis, a Taliban-affiliated network blamed for a 2011 attack on the US Embassy in Kabul which claimed 16 lives.

&gt; Though the Army said most of the 43 companies were not awarded new contracts, the Pentagon ruled out permanent blocks on future dealings. John F. Sopko said, ""That's the absurdity of it. We can attack them via drone on Monday and issue them a contract on Tuesday.""

*6.  The ""Grand Central station of illicit activities"" in Afghanistan*

&gt; Activity at the Kabul International Airport, a joint civilian-military facility, was almost all closely overseen by the US-led coalition. Except for Ramp #5.

&gt; Western officials noted that unscheduled aircraft were landing on that ramp in the dead of night, with their cargo being unloaded hastily. One official had a name for that loading area: the ""Grand Central station of illicit activities"".

&gt; The Afghan Air Force (AAF) was made possible by US funds, but in 2012 was being investigated separately by both by the US military and the DEA for widespread use of aircraft to ferry drugs and guns around the country. USAF Lt. Col. Frank Bryant watched helicopters disappearing without flight plans for many months, before recommending restrictions of fuel supplies until the AAF improved transparency about cargo and destinations.

*5. Pentagon munitions leaked from Afghan forces to Taliban militants*

&gt; According to a 2009 New York Times study of ammo markings, 17 out of 30 rifle magazines recovered from insurgent corpses in Afghanistan were loaded with rounds ""identical"" to ammunition provided by the US to Afghan forces.

&gt; The Times blamed ""poor discipline and outright corruption among Afghan forces"", while the US Army admitted that leakage of armanents to insurgents was an ""absolutely worst-case scenario"".

&gt; While accounting for firearms was somewhat better -- although thousands of rifles provided to Afghan security forces went missing prior to the Times study -- tracking ammunition is a much harder task. Resources were simply not available to effectively coordinate the examination of munitions found in battle theaters, even if it would have provided major clues about holes in supply chains.

*4. A systematic cover-up of electoral fraud*

&gt; Peter Galbraith, who was sacked as Deputy Special Representative to the UN mission in Kabul in 2009, claimed that his superior and head of the mission, Kai Eide, had ordered him to conceal evidence of hundreds of cases of electoral fraud.

&gt; According to Galbraith, the UN had collected ample evidence that a full third of President Karzai's votes were fraudulent. Information on turnout in key Southern provinces had apparently revealed that while few voters showed up, masses of votes were reported.

&gt; Kai Eide had allegedly prevented the sharing of this data with any party, including the Afghan Electoral Complaints Commission, which has a legal mandate to investigate fraud. Following Galbraith's dismissal, at least five of his colleagues resigned.

*3. The puzzle over billions of dollars flying out of Afghanistan*

&gt; An estimated $1 Billion in cash left Kabul in passenger planes annually, mostly bound for Dubai on six daily scheduled flights. A US official monitoring Afghanistan's role as a cash transfer hub said that ""all this money magically appears from nowhere.""

&gt; This great cash exodus usually occurred in plain view of customs officers, since any amount could be legally transferred if declared (with only minimal information required) at the airport. Wealthy Afghans favored the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai as a safe haven for their families and riches.

&gt; Competing theories about the origin of these vast cash exports, which often exceeded $1m per passenger in varied currencies, range from the booming opium trade, to traders wanting to import goods with minimal paperwork, to Saudi donations intended for the construction of mosques and other projects.

&gt; However, the most likely source of the majority of cash leaving Kabul on a daily basis was surely the tens of billions spent by Coalition partners across the country with little subsequent oversight.

*2. Taliban funding coming in large part from its #1 enemy*

&gt; One could barely invest anything in Afghanistan without the Taliban taking a big chunk. Whether the result of extortion or good business sense, local contractors would divert funds to make their lives easier.

&gt; It was the open secret of the occupation: a prime source of Taliban funding was its number one enemy. It was once thought that drug money provided the lion's share, but Richard Holbrooke, US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told a press conference in Islamabad ""that simply is not true.""

&gt; High-level negotiations took place between the Taliban and major contractors, to ensure safe deliveries, or even the successful completion of projects. One construction firm apportioned a minimum 20% into cost estimates for the Taliban. A pipe supplier tacked on 30% to secure imports from Pakistan. In Farah province, locals reported the Taliban taking a whopping 40% of funds from the Afghan National Solidarity Program, responsible for over 60,000 projects nationwide.",null,1,null,1430066134,null,0,false,0,cqpa7vu,null,t3_33x5wd,null,t1_cqpa7vu,null,t1_cqpa5q6,null,null,null,1432614070,null,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4,null

It's a matter of different perspectives, not outright contempt.

&gt; My comment about core support being priced out was based on simple supply and demand economics. If the stadium gets filled week in week out, do you really think they care who is sitting on the seat?

is ludicrous. No I don't think they care, but that is **exactly** the problem. Football isn't supposed to be a business. We're supporters, not customers. This is something that is engrained into a lot of us, in which we follow in the footsteps of our family and support the club that was once a big part of our local community. It's not like it's a fucking chain of supermarkets and we can just go an support another club if the prices get too high. I'd switch my weekly shop from Tesco to Sainsburys if Tescos got to costly, but I'm not gonna switch from city to united am I.

We have a right to be outraged at being priced out of something we've been following all our lives. Just because you sit on your chair and stream every single game for free doesn't mean that ticket pricing isn't an issue. You are allowed to care about what other people are going through you know.

I don't see us being able to beat Napoli or Wolfsburg to even get into the semi-finals at this point. Some people may be more optimistic but I'm simply going off of our results this season. 

Now, if we continue that strand, it would be severely foolish to enter into the EL willingly: we have almost no chance of winning it and it has proven almost every season to have detrimental affects on the league position and form of the team playing in it. So, we're effectively ruining our chances of a top 4 finish *next* season to enter a competition that we'll most likely not win anyway.

My argument is that non-Muslim terrorists are not ignored. The 29 people blown up in a car park near me in 1998 was by a non-Muslim terrorist if you somehow missed that. You're arguing against an imaginary point that I never made.

&gt;If he was called Abdullah we would have gone ""Terrorist"" and just ignored anything else.

That's not true. [An Egyptian pilot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameel_Al-Batouti) killed a bunch of people crashing his plane in the same way and it was accepted that there's no evidence he was a terrorist. You're just assuming a bias where there isn't one other than your own.

&gt;What? Saudi Arabia are one of the biggest sponsors of Al-Qaeda. Seriously? Al-Shabab were born out of the export of Saudi Shariah to Somalia. In general we don't bomb Saudi because we like their oil. 

We don't bomb them because they co-operate with our military and fight hard against terrorism themselves.

&gt;And are you high? A huge amount of civlians are killed.

Do you know how many civilians would have been killed without the war on terror? No, so you can't say if it is more or less. US left Iraq, and there are still huge amounts of civilians being killed. US tried to prevent that, and it's not US' fault that they couldn't defeat terrorism in Iraq. Even when the US was occupying Iraq, terrorists were targeting civilians rather than soldiers. 

&gt;Are you daft, the war on terror destabilised Iraq and started a civil war which has left close to 200,000 people dead. That is on our hands.

No it's not. 1/4 as many people died per day after Saddam was removed than while he was in power. Who knows how many would have died if he remained in power. The fact Iraq is in a civil war was inevitable and the US' bears little responsibility. Just look at the countries US didn't invade like Syria.

&gt;The majority of people killed in Iraq were not terrorists.

More than 80% of civilian deaths during US occupation were caused by the terrorists. Why do you blame US for civilian deaths from terrorism?

&gt;Possibly because bombing his homeland would kill a lot of Americans (Russia can put up one hell of a fight). 

Russia is already bombing his homeland and has killed 2,000 there in the past 5 years. When countries deal with their own terrorists, the US has no need to get involved.",null,0,null,1430067533,null,0,false,0,cqpaz0z,null,t3_33sz4c,null,t1_cqpaz0z,null,t1_cqp4wg5,null,null,null,1432614426,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Vietto has the potential to become world class. At Liverpool he will get the playing time to fulfill that potential. If he does it's fantastic. If ot, we're no worse off than we are now. 

The alternative you mention, Benteke. Great player but is coming back from a long term injury. He's been injury prone in the past. So he comes with risks too, as does any player. He'd probably be in the same region price-wise as Vietto.

For any signing wou have to weigh the risk against the potential reward. Vietto is high risk but potentially high reward. Benteke is medium risk, medium reward. He's a solid 15 goal a season striker.

null,false,Melberger,null,null,null,"I'm from Manchester, and my first game at Maine Road was against Burnley back in 98 when we were in League 1, so as I've described previously, that's why there's a particular unease with new fans solely here for the glory.

&gt;My comment about core support being priced out was based on simple supply and demand economics. If the stadium gets filled week in week out, do you really think they care who is sitting on the seat?

That's a lie. You said you simple didn't care, even mockingly stating after that you watch on Sky, so effectively it's not an issue for you. I read it just moments ago. You showed a clear contempt for the core support of the club you claim to support.

&gt;I appreciate people are hostile to new fans, especially ones that are perceived as new fans but at the end of the day I honestly couldn't care less.

The hostility comes primarily from the attitude. If you care about the issues effecting the core support, then you're unlikely to face such hostility. If you dismiss them and ridicule people who care about them, then you'll face a lot of hostility (maybe not on this sub, where the culture isn't a reflection of our core support, but if you ever came to Manchester you'd be in for a shock). You'll always face some amount of ridicule for your motives for supporting City, but this will depreciate greatly if you grow to understand the club and the culture around it, if you grow to understand the core support and what matters to us. At the moment you're still effectively peering from the outside looking in, and it reflects in your comments - and attitude.

&gt;Sure I wasn't down there watching the games when we were in League 1, but I suspect you weren't either.

See previously, you are wrong. I was, and many of us were. That's why the unease exists. That's why people like me are particularly militant about this, because I grew up in Manchester when City were shite and United were one of the top sides in Europe. If everyone in Manchester was a shallow gloryhunter only interested in success and trophies, then City wouldn't exist as we know the club today - and people like you would be choosing to support Chelsea rather than City, as most did back in the 90s when United were in vogue.

You know that in 99 we played in a play-off final to reach the championship against your local club right? We narrowly beat Gillingham on penalties. If we hadn't it would've been disastrous for the club financially, we may have still been yo-yoing through the divisions if it wasn't for that game. People like me would still hold our season tickets in such a scenario though, while you wouldn't bat an eyelid at us. It's the same reason you don't support Gillingham - your local club.

&gt;you're the exact type of elitist type football fan that is the problem with this game.

Again, the lack of self-awareness is staggering. You've only been following the sport for, apparently, 4 years. How do you know what the issues are for football fans, you've never even been to a game?

That's the key though, people like me are the problem for people like you. We're critical of your choice to support a top club that represents a city you've never been to, let alone hail from. People like me are the vast majority at every single club in the country; big and small. And you know this, but that's not your culture. And that's your problem.

&gt;How about you embrace fans, even if you find them plastic, and appreciate that Man City now has a global reach.
Our fan base is quickly accumulating as many plastics as Chelsea and United, and it will only continue to increase as we win more and more. No point living in denial

I'll never embrace plastic fans. I'm just learning to accept it as part and parcel of becoming a top side. Why should I embrace plastic fans?

Did they embrace us when we were shit? No, they ridiculed us and paraded the achievements of United in our faces for example.

There's no denial on my part, I understand the wider picture, the denial seems to be coming from yourself.",null,0,null,1430067936,null,0,false,0,cqpb784,null,t3_33uj40,null,t1_cqpb784,null,t1_cqp9pfg,null,null,null,1432614603,null,0,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,0,null

----

&gt; 10) The $37m border bridge enabling bulk opium and heroin 
exports

&gt;Now, hundreds of trucks potentially loaded with opium and heroin are ushered across by bribed border officials each week, with no US or Nato involvement on either side.

So a bridge was built that enables trade (and you can see the result of all of NATO's economic stimulus efforts on Afghan GDP [here](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=afghan+GDP&amp;oq=afghan+GDP&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2399j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=afghanistan+gross+domestic+product&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAGOovnz8BQMDgwUHjxK7fq6-QVZKipZ2drKVfk5-cmJJZn6efnEJkC4uyUxOzIkvSk0HClmlpxTE5-XnZuYl5pQFGdgsfV4Vz_-3c2mS5uZd3RWlJwAzzKhPVQAAAA)), in one of the poorest countries in the world, and the side effect is that drug traffickers also use it?

In one of the poorest countries in the world? Shock! I'm sure this doesn't happen in *any* other nation with similar wealth!

How is this NATO channeling drugs, when your source specifically says there is no NATO involvement?

Again: *nothing you just pasted in any way suggests or proves it to be a ""war of aggression""*.

&gt;9) Nato forces supplying food, water and arms to Taliban forces

&gt;On one occasion in 2008, Nato admitted accidentally dropping pallets laden with ammunition, rocket-propelled grenades, food and water into Taliban-controlled territory in Southern Afghanistan. The containers were destined for local police forces in a remote region, but grid references were allegedly confused by helicopter pilots.

So you're telling me a Chinook pilot missed his drop target on one mission in 2008, by accident, and you conflated that with NATO forces supplying food, water, and arms *intentionally and on a regular basis* (of which neither is true)?

What utter shit. Your copypasta uses *extremely* misleading subtitles.

Again: *nothing you just pasted in any way suggests or proves it to be a ""war of aggression""*.

&gt;8) The British plan to run a Taliban training camp for 2,000 fighters

&gt;the goal was to encourage the Taliban recruits to ""swap sides"" and fight insurgents

That seems like a valid plan that would be drafted during such a war. Whether it's a good idea or not is irrelevant. What's significant about this?

Again: *nothing you just pasted in any way suggests or proves it to be a ""war of aggression""*.

&gt;7) The US paying $150 million to companies accused of financing insurgents

Sounds like a legitimate fuckup, which it was. What's the relevance here? In a country like Afghanistan fuckups like this are inevitable.

Btw, $150m is peanuts in the grand scale of things.

Again: *nothing you just pasted in any way suggests or proves it to be a ""war of aggression""*.

&gt;6) The ""Grand Central station of illicit activities"" in Afghanistan

I doubt you have the knowledge of geopolitics to understand this, but this is an example of the line between direct control and allowing autonomy.

NATO was trying to step-by-step give Afghanistan more control over its own affairs with the eventual goal of giving them full control (which was achieved last year).

If you do this, you're going to have issues with Taliban infiltrators using government resources. It's going to happen.

Afghanistan is not perfect.

Again: *nothing you just pasted in any way suggests or proves it to be a ""war of aggression""*.

&gt;5) Pentagon munitions leaked from Afghan forces to Taliban militants

Yup. The Taliban stole ammunition from the ANA in mases. This is a well-known fact. But it's legitimate military action on the Taliban's part and stupidity of the ANA- not some grand intentional plan. What's your point here?

Again: *nothing you just pasted in any way suggests or proves it to be a ""war of aggression""*.

&gt;4) A systematic cover-up of electoral fraud

These were the first elections *in Afghan history*.

As with all poor democracies, electoral fraud is an unfortunate reality. But even if 1/3 of votes were fraudulent (I sincerely doubt that) a 2/3 valid democracy is still better than a 0/3 democracy religious theocracy.

The only way to go is up, as democracy improves in the country.

Again: *nothing you just pasted in any way suggests or proves it to be a ""war of aggression""*.

---

Everything you've posted here has nothing to do with ""war of aggression"".

What is *does* seem to be attempting (very very poorly) to create is a narrative that the west was keeping the Taliban alive to have an enemy to fight.

This is totally absurd, and even your source doesn't seem to think so.

All of the fees are here: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/415145/Master_Fees_Leaflet_2015.pdf
and it's £1005 for an adult application and £749 for a child application.

For time periods, this forum has some information from people [applying last year](http://www.immigrationboards.com/british-citizenship/naturalisation-application-processing-timelines-only-t80616-5580.html), and it seems to vary but around 6 months seems reasonable.

The Enlightenment approach to Islam would be to aim to treat each Muslim as an individual with full human rights, whilst placing a low value on any special rights for Muslims and it certainly doesn't involve defending Islam from criticism.  Contrast that with the approach from identity politics,  in which we're constantly asked to make judgements according to what's best for Muslims/women/northerners/introverts etc. and how best to prevent their oppression.  

So, for instance, identity politics would encourage us to see Charlie Hebdo as an assault on Muslim values and a participant in their oppression, whereas the liberal Enlightenment approach would be to say that the right of freedom of speech which is given to everyone trumps any collective rights for a religious group.

But perhaps you can be overly extreme in each direction.  I think there is *something* to be said for valuing *some* group identities - so that I think it's OK that we try to minimize problems like anti-semitism and muslimphobia, even when it's targeting a group and not individuals.

We seem to have had 2 targets, one of which wasn't as reliable as needed to begin with (Remy), and missed them both.  How in the world were there not at least 15 more players in the queue before we arrived at Balotelli, who is straight up the exact opposite of the type of player that fits the way we play?

Your point about Sterling applies to just about everyone I think, except maybe Coutinho, who has managed to remain mostly effective despite being man-marked heavily in the past few months.  With so much focus on the forwards last season there was also less pressure on Gerrard specifically, which I think makes a huge difference in his play from last season to this season.  Once teams were able to set up camp around Gerrard and really press the hell out of him he just went off the rocker, but with Sturridge and Suarez in front of him last season they couldn't really press that high up or they'd be torn apart as soon as the ball crossed the half way line.

The German air controllers at Frankfurt Airport are renowned as a short-tempered lot.

Speedbird 206: ""Frankfurt, Speedbird 206 clear of active runway.""

""Speedbird 206. Taxi to gate Alpha One-Seven.""

The BA 747 pulled onto the main taxiway and slowed to a stop.

Ground: ""Speedbird, do you not know where you are going?""

Speedbird 206: ""Stand by, Ground, I'm looking up our gate location now.""

Ground (with arrogant impatience): ""Speedbird 206, have you not been to Frankfurt before?""

The DoH has always made it clear about the reduced tariffs per procedure and the targets expected for those that bothered to take an interest.

I think contempt is a wildly inaccurate word to use in this instance. If I have given the impression that I hold some type of contempt to local fans, then I am sorry for that, but I don't believe that I have.

Maybe my lack of appreciation for the role MCFC or football clubs can hold to their local community is because I have grown up without it around me. Gillingham as you may know if you ever had the unfortunateness of visiting, has pretty much nothing in it. Gillingham Football Club languishes in League One and is definitely not an area of pride for the region.

In the past, Football Clubs seem to be to have been a community thing first, and entertainment business second but in this day and age the positions have switched. A Football club is predominantly an entertainment business.

If Locals get priced out, that's a shame but football is  a global phenomenon now and no longer a working mans hobby. 

On a personal level, I feel the prices are far too high but I can't blame a club for charging what it does. The prices won't change until we stop filling the stadium every game - It is basic supply &amp; demand economics.

I appreciate my position may be seen as harsh, but as someone who holds libertarian values, I strongly believe that businesses have the right to decide their own prices for whatever they want. MCFC are charging what they feel is a fair price. If you don't like it, don't buy the ticket. Watch the game at the pub, like many other people do - Vote with your feet as they say.

We simply have a fundamental disagreement about something. I feel no ill will towards you, but rather admire your position. Being able to support a club from the bad days through to the good days, and being able to go to all the games will be a much sweeter experience than just being able to ride on the good times.

If you were to read through my comment history on /r/MCFC, you would know I'm an active and involved member on here and enjoy seeing us do well. Feeling the need to resort to name calling is pretty childish and tragic on every level, even if you fundamentally feel I'm a terrible person.

If you were to never come back to the sub, I don't think we would lose anything of value. I feel like your comments just alienate newer fans and make us feel unwelcome. If you're unhappy with the way things have played out, feel free to leave.

There was no great scouting effort. We were looking at the same players who signed for clubs that offered better money and locales. We didn't look at Depay in the summer (even though he fits the bill of a winger who can score that Rodgers talked about needing when he first got here). We didn't do a lot. That doesn't fall on Rodgers. And who could have imagined that Sturridge would only start 8 games in the league. Even if he started 19 we'd be looking at a different season. 

Manager's arrogance not change things up? Rodgers has tailored his formations to our sides and found ways through in his time here more than any other manager of a big club. 3 at the back? Last year's 2 up front and Gerrard as the quarterback? Those were not Rodgers planned formations. Those were attempts at getting the most out of our best 11.

1) Make Revision Notes using a revision guide, and condense the notes into your own words. 

2) Add/Draw pictures relating to those notes to refer back to. 

3) Start highlighting the key information from the notes (definitions, names, methods etc.) 

4) Now make a mind map diagram or a poster that relates and refers back to the information from your notes. 

5) Stick the poster somewhere you go often and always read and look at it frequently. 

6) After this, make flash cards using your notes. Write down exam style questions on one side, then precisely write the answer on the opposite side. 

7) After this, rehearse the flash cards until the information sticks into your head. You can make two separate piles depending on the questions you got correct and the ones you got wrong 

8) Now rehearse more in depth with the flash cards you got incorrect 

9) After this keep reading your notes and your mind map, and recite information out loud while walking around. 

10) After you have effectively learned your notes, poster and got all the questions on your flash cards correct, now make a check list regarding the topic to see which areas you struggle on most. 

11) After you have covered everything, and made your resources, make a clear timetable on when you can keep coming back and revising that subject. 

12) After everything is in place, print out A LOT of past papers, from your Exam Board (Edexcel, OCR, AQA and WJEC) and do these papers in timed exam conditions for preparation. 

13) Now print out mark schemes and mark your paper to see how much questions you got right and wrong. 

14) Highlight all the questions and topics on your paper you lost marks on to see which areas you struggled on. 

15) With all the Questions you got wrong, keep revising that topic and carry on doing past papers until you are sick of them!

null,false,BringElephantsNow,null,null,null,"""Safe"" may not be the best term. Like any investments in S&amp;S's the value of the individual share prices can go down as well as up.

For example, take Facebook. Friday (stock markets aren't ""open"" on weekends) FB opened at 82.77 and closed at 81.53 which equals roughly -1%. So if you'd invested £100, it's now only worth £99.

However, this risk can be mitigated through investment into investment funds. An investment fund essential pools your money with other people with a similar risk profile to yourself. This larger pool of money allows a fund manager to invest in a wider series of shares, so the money in the fund may suffer from the fall in facebook, but may simultaneously gain from a rise in Volkswagen AG. 

As your money is part of the fund, your money will rise or fall in step with the fund, so if the fund gains 2%, your money will gain 2% (minus any fees). 

As part of a S&amp;S ISA, it is likely your money will be managed by your bank, who will decide where your money goes depending on your risk profile. So ultimately, you pay into the bank, the bank do the invest-y bit, and you'll get an annual or 6-monthly updates on how your money has performed.

If your interested it's worth going and having a conversation with your bank. Figure out what your risk profile may be, check out some standard figures, past performance, fees and charges, etc, and see if it suits you. 

But always keep in mind there is a risk that your investment may be worth less than you have paid in.",null,0,null,1430074666,null,0,false,0,cqpf0u0,null,t3_33xa6f,null,t1_cqpf0u0,null,t1_cqpadgl,null,null,null,1432616403,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

Parking a bus isn't really a tactical masterclass, it requires good coaching (as we saw with West Brom) and to break one open you need luck. When a good team parks the bus they leave very little room between the defense and midfield, and always have people between the ball and the goal in the box so that it's nigh on impossible to get a clear shot at goal.

Defensive unit.

Terry and Cahill have been a CB partnership at Chelsea for quite some time. Also, they've been international teammates. They have a certain chemistry, a certain understanding that makes them a formidable unit to be up against. This understanding comes with playing together, getting stuck in arsecracking situations and coming out of it, making mistakes together. Getting this chemistry would take time between Zouma and Terry(assuming it is Terry you want to start alongside Happy).

So, if you are building a title winning squad and you want to push for the title, you need to have a defensive unit that is familiar with each other and understands each other.

MRI scans offer a clearer and more detailed image of the brain and can show the difference between grey and white matter. The two main types of matter in the brain are grey matter, which forms the outer layer of the brain where information is processed, and white matter, which forms the inner core and provides the 'wiring' for information to move along. MRI scans are powerful enough to reveal subtle changes to the blood vessels in the white matter, a common sign of vascular dementia. Research has shown that MRI scans successfully reveal the loss of brain cells in the hippocampus in 80 to 90 per cent of cases of people with Alzheimer's disease, even in people who are in the early stages of the condition.

null,false,Melberger,null,null,null,"See, mate, this is where I have a problem. You talk somewhat condescendingly about Gillingham, your local club, 'languishing' in League One.

You do realise that was City once upon a time? My local club was in League One, and that's the first time I was introduced to it. I had a choice between that club and the other local one which won the treble that year.

If I had your attitude I'd never have been a City fan.

Don't you understand that?

&gt;In the past, Football Clubs seem to be to have been a community thing first, and entertainment business second but in this day and age the positions have switched. A Football club is predominantly an entertainment business.

Have to disagree here. That's the way it's increasingly going in the top of the sport, but all clubs are fundamentally representing the city/town they hail from, it's why we bear the title 'Manchester' as a prefix to City. All clubs rely on their core support. Without that they lose all character and soul.

Some clubs are happy to lose more of that character than others, but all know without that core support they are nothing. Less so financially for the biggest clubs now, but character wise certainly.

&gt;On a personal level, I feel the prices are far too high but I can't blame a club for charging what it does. The prices won't change until we stop filling the stadium every game - It is basic supply &amp; demand economics.

This is precisely where the resentment comes in for new fans, football tourists and plastics.

Bar the younger kids, they're all people who didn't care about City prior to our success. They're people who've effectively created an artificial demand for tickets which has allowed the club to repeatedly increase prices, and price out the fans they once relied on due to no longer needing them as a result of this new demand for tickets from plastics who didn't care about us not so long ago.

And this is something you said you didn't care about. The primary and most incendiary issue among all long standing blues is something you're happy to casually dismiss.

&gt;I appreciate my position may be seen as harsh, but as someone who holds libertarian values, I strongly believe that businesses have the right to decide their own prices for whatever they want. MCFC are charging what they feel is a fair price. **If you don't like it, don't buy the ticket. Watch the game at the pub, like many other people do - Vote with your feet as they say.**

Again, this goes back to you fundamentally misunderstanding what a club is. And for what it's worth, many are already doing this. Many are being forced to due to cost.

A lot of people can no longer afford to attend games at City due to these increases, many are ceasing to due to principle, and that means our club is losing it's very character; slowly but surely.

But of course that's of no value to you.

Our match going crowd is being slowly gentrified, and the number of longstanding blues is shrinking each year. My season ticket will cost £800 this year. I've known the people sat around me in the rows in front, behind and to the side for 10 years, all on a first name basis. Handshakes every other week. And for the first time this year, two blues beside me, that I've known for 10 years, are moving due to cost.

The social aspect is something that you won't grasp as someone who doesn't attend. But if the people around me continued to be divided up, and replaced, hypothetically, with plastic fans, that would seriously harm my enjoyment of attending. As long as I can afford it I'll be there, and I'll always move if need be, because I'm there to support City first and foremost, but if cost becomes too much, and I can't relocate to a cheaper area, then that's it. You're out.

And there are plenty who have already been there. If you can't afford a season ticket due to cost or work/family commitments, it's now even costlier to attend a few fixtures a season - due to our individual tickets being now among the most expensive in the league, now you even need a £35 membership just to simply buy match tickets.

The divisions between the club and the supporters are growing, and it is not a positive in anyway shape or form for the club and its future. The equation is much greater than a simple economic one and extremely small percentage increases in overall revenue.

&gt;If you're unhappy with the way things have played out, feel free to leave.

The top 1% account for 13.7% of pre-tax income and contributed 30% of income tax in 2013-2014.  So they do pay more than their fair share both in absolute terms of the tax proportion they pay and their income relative to everyone else. Whether or not you think they should pay more is another argument.

http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140206164307/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/tax-statistics/table2-4.pdf

EDIT: Also interesting to note that in the immediate aftermath of the crisis in 2008 the top 50% saw their relative incomes decrease whilst the bottom 50% relative income increased, suggesting that the top 50% were hit much harder relatively than the bottom 50%. 

But these are quite interesting statistics showing relative incomes, seems like the ones who have been hit hardest relatively are the middle classes over the last few years. They do also show that whilst the relative income of the top 1% has increased this is offset by an even larger increase in their tax burden, so according to this it looks like they have got richer but the result of this is a dis proportionate increase in their tax bill, which is how I think we could all agree it should work. eg from 2013 to 2014 the 1% saw their relative income increase by 1.8% (which is the biggest jump in the whole table for them, it's usually been a steady increase) and this resulted in their proportion of the income tax bill increasing by 2.9%.",null,0,null,1430077206,null,0,1430078885,0,cqpgh5b,null,t3_33wo0k,null,t1_cqpgh5b,null,t1_cqpfre4,null,null,null,1432617088,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

They also made a couple of world beaters in the Land Rover and the Range Rover.

Not to mention they made the first commercially successful safety bicycle, i.e. the sort of bike that pretty much everyone rides now. In fact they were so well known the word for bicycle in Poland and Belarus is derived from the word Rover. 

If Rover hadn't merged with LMC and then become part of BL they may have competed with the German brands like BMW and Audi. They were certainly better placed to do it than most of the British car companies. 

For instance they were working on the P9 mid-engined V8 sportscar when they were merged with BL but it was cancelled, allegedly because jaguar thought it would take sales from the E-Type.

Also worth noting is that this article isn't about that force routinely arming ALL of their officers with pistols; it's about whether their armed response unit should carry their sidearm on them at all times, rather than locked in a safe in the car.

Bearing that in mind, what they're effectively doing is allowing public opinion to make an operational decision.  
Sidearms are widely carried overtly by armed officers because they tend to go to the jobs where there's a serious threat to life.  I can tell you from experience that these jobs go from 0-life threatening in seconds, so spontaneous necessity to defend yourself could occur.

* ~~Cnut~~ Miliband is grandstanding in defence of Scottish Labour, which is clearly doomed at this point. He can't seriously be convinced that his tough talk is going to make everyone suddenly think 'Hmm, actually the last year has all been for naught and we hate the SNP and are going to vote Labour again'. His line on the SNP only reinforces the way they present themselves, as an alternative to the entrenched forces of Westminster.

* Without the SNP, he is almost certainly not going to be able to form a government.  So the first thing he will do after the election is have to break a pledge. A very bad start, unless he truly wants to force another election, which is in my view more likely to galvanize the SNP vote than damage it.

* The SNP has certain demands that, at the moment, they refuse to sway on. It's far better to wait until after the election and let the SNP be the ones who have to compromise themselves to have an administration which will be more favourable to their interests. They clearly won't do any deals with the Tories. Not only will the Tories not concede anything to them, it would damage the current swell of the SNP enormously.

* Were I Miliband, I wouldn't be shitting in the lap of someone I might have to rely on as an ally. I'd be using language along the lines of 'trusting the voters to make the right choice for them' and 'believing in the power of democracy' - ambiguous enough to leave any avenue open. The refusal to concede to the possibility of anything less than a majority makes both Labour and the Tories look very greedy for power. I mean, it's the truth, but it still looks bad. They care more about power than coming to an agreement that truly represents the will of the public. Concessions are bad for their ideological dogma. Goodness knows we can't have any parties influencing government that support evidence-based policy.

* It's debatable (though I'd argue the truth of it myself) that the public are pulling towards the progressive left overall. Certainly the rise of UKIP is a valid counterpoint. It certainly seems that people are increasingly tired of the functionally two-party system we've had in this country for a long while. Labour obviously don't want left-wing parties pulling them left, instead maintaining the bullshit austerity/deficit rhetoric. That isn't going to reflect well on them in the long run.

This is assuming that Labour end up trying to form a government rather than the Tories.

Anyway, yeah. Miliband is being stupid and is going to further damage Labour.",null,0,null,1430078938,null,0,false,0,cqphgtt,null,t3_33wusi,null,t1_cqphgtt,null,t1_cqpfvqe,null,null,null,1432617556,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

null,false,Silent_Ranger,null,null,null,"You're right about Atletico, they're on pace for 2 fewer goals in the league than last season and have already conceded as many goals as they did last year (with 5 games to go).

However your assessment of the management's personnel decisions is a bit harsh. We brought in Manquillo at RB and he was solid for several months before we switched to a back 3 and moved Sterling/Ibe/Markovic to RWB, we signed Moreno to be the long-term LB and he's been decent albeit a little inconsistent, we brought in Emre Can and Adam Lallana to strengthen the midfield which they've done quite well, and signed Lovren to add stability at the back where there is stll a bit of work to be done. It's not exactly like the management didn't know what they were doing. The issue was that the main attacking options that BR wanted to sign fell through (namely Alexis Sanchez wanting to go to Arsenal) so our biggest weakness went totally unaddressed. I'm not in a position to really say who is to blame for that shortfall but it's obvious that there were several stages of scouting/recruiting in the summer and the end result was a last minute Mario Balotelli. Maybe they did go after Griezmann or Mandzukic but we never heard about it, maybe they abandoned going after those players because they showed even less interest than Falcao, maybe there was some other player that didn't move that we were interested in that never got published in the papers (like Diego Costa last season when he opted to stay with Atletico), maybe Sanchez was ""the guy"" and once it fell through they didn't have a plan B, but the truth is that only those in the front office actually know what happened and why.

null,false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"You say my argument is specious but then you go on to agree with me... It's well studied that the idea of integration and 'belonging' depends on factors such as non-superficial relationships with neighbours, eg, supporting the same football team and chatting about it, and the hegemonic social norms of the area. It's a hot topic in Sociology and many other areas of behavioural science.

&gt;People generally like to hang around other people with similar cultures. 

It depends on your culture and the culture of the area in which you live. If you live in a multicultural area where there is no prevailing social norm then you just tend to stick with what you know. Now consider the areas in Britain which poorer migrants typically live in and who they associate with on a day-to-day basis. These are areas with other poor migrants from many different places from across the globe and as such there is no overarching social system which you adhere to. Religion can be a binding social construct which gives otherwise isolated people a sense of belonging - if you have nothing else in common with somebody else being the same religion gives you a starting point to build upon. It's a normal human thing to do, to want to belong. The fact they do this at all is evidence that they want to integrate with the host society.

Taking this a step further, when you have a tenuous sense of belonging to the society around you and people start villifying that link you have (Muslims are bad eggs, grr!) you're naturally going to be quite defensive of that. All you know of Britain is that there are Muslims living here and they are your friends, why are people having a go at them!? So as you say, they close ranks as an act of solidarity.

The issue is that while the people themselves may be nice and, without realising it, these people are fostering a culture which may be considered not compatible with the wider society because they don't know anything else. They are not part of the society that the majority of people are. It's up to us as a host country to integrate them and stop pretending that these problems happen in a vacuum. If it means spending a bit more money to educate them and avoid having riots on the streets then let's do that and stop blaming people who are not well integrated into British society. It's not being soft, it's being pragmatic and addressing an issue which is already causing problems.",null,0,null,1430081250,null,0,1430081511,0,cqpis0c,null,t3_33wqmc,null,t1_cqpis0c,null,t1_cqphelc,null,null,null,1432618184,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Olivier's physique in the early 10's was very impressive. He has a naturally lean frame and his subtle muscle mass really complemented this. Great defined abs and body shape that could make any girl blush. An aspect i loved of his body was the rugged facial hair and thick, clean and stylish hair. It really complimented his 'boy coming into manhood' phase. I often find my self watching his old matches just to stare and look at his 'sexy boy' body. Any celebration move he performed really showcased his pristine body. A complete joy to watch especially his abs in his wet kit. Sometimes i replay it numerous times.

Downing is an example of a player with awful mentality for playing football - has plenty of ability but never looked like sure of what he wanted to do and didn't look like he was going to go through that wall to win.

With Suarez we lost not only a player with great ability but also great mentality. We have to find a new one. Even if it's by accident. He doesn't have to be a top class player, but he has to be able to contribute. I think Can has potential to become that player but he's clearly not there yet. Some of our players are too soft.

Firstly, good or bad compared to what? No government? Then they are all good, something is better than anarchy or stagnation. 

What even is the definition of good? What is the definition of bad? You end up talking in statistical averages that is relevant to no one person, then you aren't even doing that you are just talking about ill informed opinion, on a subject where their is just complete ignorance to what the parties even are going to do in power, let alone what a coalition would do, as no one knows the answer to that. 

What you end up with is exactly this, the conservatives and labour with statistically insignificant margins with the people who were going to vote for them saying they are great the others saying they are bad, the current government being worse than just the conservatives as now it hasn't got 100% of the conservative voters saying it is good, the labour lib dem vote option being slight lower than that because it is a less known quantity and humans don't like change and then as you add parties there is more unknowns so people like it less. 

No shit that is the outcome, that isn't the outcome of rational thought, it is the probable outcome of known vs unknown quantities.  

I wonder what the margin of error is on this data, but I would rather like to bet the 1 party, 2 parties and 3 parties are well with in it.

null,false,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,null,"The EU hasn't always been the UK's largest trading partner; in the run up to joining the EEC the UK did a huge amount of trade with the Indian sub-continent, the rest of the Commonwealth and others. There are some people who question the figures about UK/EU trade, as a lot of exports are counted as being traded with the EU because they first dock in Rotterdam, NL before being shipped worldwide.

The EU is going to make up just 10-15% of the world's economy by 2050. It's a shrinking economy of low-growth markets, with low-productivity labour and not much to look forward to. The sovereign debt crisis' are going to drag on for *decades*, with the end-game being...

Centralised federalism. The EU has a democratic deficit that would make South American Banana Republics blush. The EU has to deal with too much diversity of sovereign nations to fully integrate politically - it'll never be like the USA with its states because it's not a blank slate. Trying to square-the-circle of reconciling Germany's dumping of its trade surplus on southern nations who can't devalue their currencies to rebalance is going to be a job larger than the East/West German reunification. If the UK stays within the EU it'll certainly be required to join the Eurozone, but paying for the marriage of North and South Europe is a complete waste of money.

What would I like to see? I'd like to see the UK leave the EU entirely and broker bilateral trade deals with every country. I wouldn't even have us in Norway's EFTA. The EU has trade deals with the US. It has trade deals with Egypt. The advantage is the UK will be able to freely trade with Nigeria, with China, with the USA, with India - all the countries that have wealth to trade. The EU would be fifth place behind those nations in trading priority.

The attitude within the EU is that they're a big deal; the UK is a small fish and can't do it alone. The truth IMO is the opposite.

Most pressures don't even produce a cut in real terms. Staffing pressures mean the NHS spends more on agency staff to fill the gaps than it would if it simply hired more people or if it raised the strict limit on bank pay. Currently, staff just drive to another NHS Trust to work at agency rates rather than work in their local one as bank. Repeat this lesson for bulk drug purchases and private contracts - trying to force cuts beyond a reasonable amount actually increases costs when they have to bail themselves out.

The common complaint I hear from people who want to leave the EU, is that it was sold to the British public as being a ""trade bloc"" (the EEC). Nobody, they claim, knew it would mean giving up sovereign powers and handing them to Brussels.  
The UK has always had a tricky relationship with Europe. When the UK first sought to join in the 1960's, British membership was vetoed by France in 1963, and again in 1967. In fact, it was the French leader, Charles de Gaulle, who had taken refuge in Britain during the Second World War, who now vetoed his ally's membership. This left a bitter taste for the British, who were still rebuilding after the war, in which they had equipped and funded French resistance fighters, and had offered sanctuary to their govermnent-in-exile.  
The prickly Anglo-French relations are still brought up today. Usually, when the French demand an end to the UK rebate, and the British demand an end to the Common Agricultural Policy which they see as handing over large sums of money to the French, in exchange for inefficiently producing foodstuffs which nobody wants to buy.  
Another area of friction is with immigration - especially since 2004, when borders were opened to citizens of the new, enlarged EU. Many people who had made a living in trades such as plumbing and building, were being put out of work by immigrants from the A8 nations, who would do the same work for much less money - and anecdotally - being paid in cash to evade taxation.  
Immigration is the main point which has driven the UK Independence Party (UKIP) to popularity. And it is the popularity of UKIP, which has caused the Conservative (Tory) Party to promise this referendum. Many of their supporters are anti-Europe, and have turned to UKIP. This has alarmed the Tories. By offering a referendum, the Tories hope to stem the haemorrhaging of support to UKIP, and for a pro-Europe Tory, it is hard to argue against having a referndum, as that is a democratic measure.  
As for TTIP, it is rarely mentioned on the TV or Radio news. What pereception of it you have will depend on what newspaper you read. Compare the [Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11173369/This-trade-deal-with-America-would-have-Churchill-beaming.html) with the [Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/us-trade-deal-full-frontal-assault-on-democracy).  
Finally - have a look at some of the stuff [which the British press has written about EU laws](http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/euromyths-a-z-index/).

I am one of these people, bunch of arrogant internet idiots in here today, the fact that you even question that you have a clue what is good for the UK, let alone have made a quantitative comparison vs party manifestos, then compared that against coalition government standpoints that are entirely unknown, is the true ridiculous level of arrogance being shown here.

Facts are I realise that this poll is meaningless, the people polled don't know what they are talking about, if I was polled I wouldn't know, the question doesn't even mean anything, the UK isn't even a thing and pretending that your average person, on the spot, is going to make a quantitative analysis of all issues and then create some kind of weighing parameter to balance them all fairly is just idiotic, even questioning whether that is going to occur is idiotic, and therefore the obvious must be assumed. 

The only relevant question would be which government would be the best for you, which is essentially who are you voting for again, with some slightly more informed people realising that it is going to be a hung parliament therefore their outright choice isn't going to occur so actually taking a more realistic approach of choosing a coalition that might exist. That would actually be a far more interesting question, as it would put UKIP and Green voters to the test, they know they aren't getting into government, and most wouldn't even want them too have a majority, it would be interesting to see what type of government they would prefer.

Fabregas has been providing assists to players like Costa and Hazard, whilst Coutinho for most of the season hasn't had a proper finisher in front of him. He can play the perfect ball through and if Sterling or an out of form Sturridge is going to waste the chance there's not much he can do to change that. 

Have Chelsea scored the best part of 20 more goals than us this season because Fabregas is directly better than Coutinho, or has Fabregas got more assists because he's playing in a team capable of scoring more goals than us? Probably the former, but you can't completely rule it one way or the other. 

Personally I think Coutinho deserves to be up there because he's currently the stand-out best player in a team who, despite it supposedly being a crap season, are still at the top end of the table. Fabregas, on the other hand, has not been particularly stand-out recently, even if that is perhaps because he's competing with the likes of Hazard and Oscar for the limelight.

I still think a Labour-SNP coalition is actually a way to get Scotland more involved in politics rather than marginalising it, which is what would happen if a Tory or Labour minority government collapses rather than work with the party elected by the majority of Scots. It's a massive ""fuck you, we don't care what you think"", and I think it's a great way to get yourself a second independence referendum.

If Scotland is voting in a majority of SNP members and yet is being ruled by a coalition of the Tories, UKIP and DUP then I think their grievances are made even more legitimate when they have at most 3 Scottish representatives in the government.

&gt;People generally like to hang around other people with similar cultures. 

You said it, not me. We do have the choice as the host nation to place these people into predominantly British communities (not necessarily white) to integrate. We don't have to throw them into deprived ghettos at all if we wanted to. Of course this would mean building some social housing which I appreciate is totally insane according to all prospective parties vying for government.

&gt;Nearly everyone in the world wants respect, a comfortable life, making friends, kindness and being surrounded by loved ones. The less people have in that respect, the more they have to cling to what little they have. This is what I meant by behavioural confirmation, you believe it's because ethnic minorities don't want to integrate

I'm confused. That's not what I think at all, this is what I said:

&gt;It's a normal human thing to do, to want to belong. The fact they do this at all is evidence that they want to integrate with the host society.

I agree with you. We both agree on this. Current science supports this as well. People want to integrate, the issue is that the society that surrounds them in deprived areas is typically non-British.

&gt;I'm arguing that it is because they find it difficult to do so because of social mobility, bigotry and racism.

Social mobility is a problem not just for recent migrants and I would argue is not exclusive to them at all. Most people come here for a better life and they will find it in most cases. Bigotry and racism are issues and we have more than fifty years of information to work with to find out what groups of people did and did not successfully integrate into our society. It bothers me that in the article linked at the top that Jewish communities, part of London for literally hundreds of years, still consider themselves to be 'other' than British. Given Miliband's secularism and atheism I'd say his Jewishness feels tenuous at best. It's his ancestry but not his identity.

We both seem to agree that 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do' is the most effective way of getting everyone to rub along together while enjoying the benefits of coexistence.",null,0,null,1430087329,null,0,1430087515,0,cqpm7mk,null,t3_33wqmc,null,t1_cqpm7mk,null,t1_cqplpbi,null,null,null,1432619802,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

 No, it's not optional. You pay NI, and you pay PAYE. We have higher tax rates than some other countries yes, but we also provide a greater amount of social security. Accept it, move on. Your only method of avoiding such high tax is not being directly employed and contracting through a self formed company and taking your wages in the form of dividends. Unless the company has offered this, it is not an option. The very vast majority of people in the UK do not do this; it comes with it's own pitfalls in the form of lack of job security and benefits (ie paid holiday, etc), yet usually comes with higher pay.

Some may suggest it's a bubble, others would say it is purely due to the fact there is not enough housing. Property is expensive, particulary in Cambridge which is probably one of the most expensive places to live in the country outside of London. It's a very desirable area. Basically, suck it up.

Interest rates are historically very low. You can get fixed rate deals in the 2% range with a larger deposit.

You can apply, sure, but you won't be getting a mortgage without any sort of credit history, or at least not one with a half decent rate. You'll need a couple of years of history, I would expect, in order to get a decent deal.

Our tax system does not work like this. You can not deduct things from PAYE (bar a few very small specific items such as uniform washing and working from a home office.)

BTL is effectively a business, and thus you can deduct expenses that relate to the business; ie, the cost of finance in a mortgage, or providing items which enable thebusiness to run, such as furniture. This is a controversial policy and many in the UK disagree with it because of the high rental prices. Note that this deduction will NOT come from your PAYE income, but rather from the income earnt through letting out the house. You are not going to reduce your PAYE payment; get that out of your head, it is simply not how the UK works!

You won't be able to do it the way you wish to, as I have said. You could techncially invest in a property while you were renting elsewhere and derive other income from it but it's not going to affect your PAYE tax bill. A buy to let mortgage is required in order to buy a house to let, and without a credit history in the UK, as a first time buyer, and also a renter, you will struggle to get anyone to lend to you. I am unsure, although am fairly sure you will be unable to buy a foreign property with a UK BTL mortgage due to the complexities of cross border transactions.

Your tax bill may seem huge, but £80k base is a very, very good salary, you will live very well here. Consider living slightly further out of cambridge central and reducing your rent costs, if you feel you need more cash.",null,0,null,1430087530,null,0,false,0,cqpmbio,null,t3_33yqht,null,t1_cqpmbio,null,t3_33yqht,null,null,null,1432619853,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

&gt; they're being rejected by Englanders who a) can't vote for them and b) can't see the effects of SNP government beyond what they hear in the right-wing press. The kind of people who have no idea about the SNP beyond ""Britain-hating, thieving porridge wogs"".


Making a sweeping statement like that is ridiculous. Not everyone, or even most, who disagree with the SNP have no idea about them. 


&gt;I still think a Labour-SNP coalition is actually a way to get Scotland more involved in politics rather than marginalising it,

At the cost of marginalising England.



&gt; which is what would happen if a Tory or Labour minority government collapses rather than work with the party elected by the majority of Scots. It's a massive ""fuck you, we don't care what you think"", and I think it's a great way to get yourself a second independence referendum.

Regardless of who governs, Scotland will have 40-50+ SNP MPs. This means they have a party that represents them in parliament. 

&gt;If Scotland is voting in a majority of SNP members and yet is being ruled by a coalition of the Tories, UKIP and DUP then I think their grievances are made even more legitimate when they have at most 3 Scottish representatives in the government. 


If the Scottish population was equal to that of England, I could see their grievances as legitimate. But it isn't, the population is much lower than that of England, and therefore they automatically will have less of a voice. It's proportional.

Nice self fulfilling prophecy. When you fellas shut up about this sort of thing, third parties will be able to fix the problems that we face.

No, that isn't what this poll shows, it shows as explained throughout all my posts, nothing, nothing at all, this is exactly what you would expect to see with known vs unknown quantities, because that is what people are voting on, they don't know anything about it just that more unknown is worse, which doesn't have to be true in anyway, but that is how humans often think, it is basic biology, less risk, less danger, less eating of poisonous berries.

All that can be read from this poll is that people know the SNP is for Scotland and not for the UK as a whole, I say know, rather than assume, because it is true. The rest is meaningless and could be garnered from polling data, which shows exactly the same thing.

Parties literally could give one crap about what are what you don't think will make a good coalition, they might care about your opinion of NHS, education, infrastructure, environmental, etc. funding, they really couldn't give two shits when they come to coalition negotiations. Go look at how many points the Lib Dems lost for making a coalition, and look how many shits they gave about the electorate before they made that coalition, the only reason they care is because they never recovered from it, because people voted for them on principle and not because they were just pushing buttons for once, the same way people are voting for the SNP and UKIP on principle this election.

533 seats in England. 59 in Scotland, of which the SNP will probably win at most 50 if they pull it off on the night. English MPs in any case will outnumber SNP ones by an order of magnitude.

You also have to remember (vis-a-vis the rest of your comment) that the main parties operate (with a few backbench exceptions) in the interests of their Southern counterparts rather than locally. They will vote on issues to benefit England due to the fact they answer to the party's chief whip, who is extremely likely to not be Scottish (in fact, they're all currently English) and therefore not give two shits about issues up here.

The green belts were intended to densify development in order to prevent urban sprawl and ensure viable communities. The idea was to force housing development into areas close to employment, so that long commutes were eliminated. This would minimize traffic congestion and fuel usage. It would provide viable town centres capable of supporting commercial activity.

This desire no longer exists. In fact, we have the direct opposite problem. Green belts are now preventing the construction of new housing near centres of employment. People are being forced into long commutes, and there are now large dormitory communities building up with little opportunity for commercial activity. Far from preventing traffic congestion and car dependence, the green belts are now fuelling both.

Finally, by creating artificial scarcity of land and property, they force up the price of land and housing; those who owned land or property 20 years ago are now far richer than most people starting out on the ""housing ladder"" today could hope to be.
