null,false,powatom,null,null,null,"&gt; Because they already know they like sausages, bacon, pork, steaks...they don't need to go without them to know they like them - hence my comment about substitutes.

There are plenty of things that people like but which are treated as 'not every day' kinds of things. People generally do not question where their meat comes from, aside from it being 'free range' or 'organic', which ultimately means very little. All I'm suggesting as a starting point is that people really do look into what they're putting into their bodies. Even putting cruelty to animals to one side, the meat people eat is not particularly healthy, having been pumped full of all kinds during the animal's lifetime. People should know about these things, and should really consider them.

&gt; I didn't say 'every meal'. Nevertheless, they're all things people couldn't go without, and would put above meat, yes? Otherwise, you're listing random foods as if people don't have a preference. They do.

Exactly, preferences - and preferences can change. People treat meat as a staple like rice or bread - and although not everybody has meat every day, *many* people do. Many people barely even acknowledge when they *do* eat meat - having covered it in some kind of sauce or masking it in other ways.

&gt; Lots of things are doable. That doesn't mean people want to do them.

There's nothing wrong with not wanting to do something - but people can and should understand what it is they're actually doing. There are ethical, health, and environmental issues associated with meat and dairy which people are largely ignorant about. We have largely accepted that certain things are 'bad' (ethically, in terms of health, or environmentally) and avoid doing them. Meat is just another thing. Just because people enjoy it doesn't mean it doesn't have severely negative issues. People should be aware of them.

&gt; Good for you. But we're talking about everyone - and lots of them prefer meat. It's really that simple.

Most people who eat meat never even attempt a serious, plant based diet - so this argument is null. You cannot have a preference over something you've never tried. I'm not talking about eating carrots and peas for the rest of your life.

&gt; My In-Laws are vegetarians. Sorry, it's just not as much fun.

This is a ridiculous assertion. It's as fun as you make it. If you can't use your imagination to cook then that's really your own problem. Anybody who actually takes an interest in what they eat will find a way to make whatever they eat interesting. The issue most people have is that they never learn how to cook without meat. We treat meat as the centre-point of meals.

&gt; I think (or like to think) that most people care about animal welfare - just because you're going to kill it for food, that doesn't mean you don't care about what sort of life it has.

People care about animal welfare in fits and starts. They care about animals that we keep as pets, and they generally protest things like poaching and random violence. For some reason, industrialised violence against a particular subset of animals is acceptable to most people - they just never think about it, or they say things like 'but people won't just stop eating meat overnight'. Nobody's expecting it to be overnight, but just like other social and cultural changes, it will be a slow revelation that our behaviour is incredibly destructive and not in our own interests or that of the planet.

&gt; That's down to price again - I'm not sure telling poor people that vegetarianism is great because they can't afford meat is going to fly too well.

How is the environmental damage down to price? The mere existence of the beef industry is responsible for between 15-20% of CO2 equivalent emissions every year, and is only rising. The meat industry will literally kill us. 

&gt; Again, we need a Quorn-style replacement so that this becomes moot.

You don't *need* one. You would prefer one. Learn how to cook without Quorn, problem solved.

&gt; Smoking is a habit. Meat is an instinctive preference.

You have lots of instincts, yet you manage to live your life by denying many of them. Imagine what the world would be like if humans acted on instinct alone.

&gt; The numbers say otherwise. Veggies aside, people generally don't because they can't afford it or can't get it.

In what way can anyone in the world 'not get' fruit and veg? If you don't have some vegetable component in your diet, you will *almost certainly* become ill. The same is not true of omitting meat. Anywhere that fruit and veg doesn't exist or isn't available, people don't live - at least not for very long.",null,0,null,1424784686,null,0,false,0,covi28d,null,t3_2wrvse,null,t1_covi28d,null,t1_covew54,null,null,null,1427426825,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Well, actually the downvotes and every reply to you bears that out. And it is hideously ironic that you could say that after claiming that anyone who disagrees with you *must* belong to a specific politcal affilation and that *must* be the reason that they're not too fond of you.

&gt;""At least I can reasonably speculate that a vaguely Pro-Tory, SNP-unpathetic post is being downloaded by SNP supporters ""

No, you can't. Because nobody here is talking about anything pro- or anti- tory or SNP. It's just you. If this were something that everyone was involving politics in (it isn't) you could maybe say it was a factor, but you'd still need something way more solid than ""I acted like a dick and people downvoted"" to make a resonable case. You completely ignore the fact that you're talking down to people, pushing a political agenda and generally being an unappealing human being - these are things that people do not like, which tends to influence their view on you.

We're creating more chances that are easier to finish, which is a very good thing.

It's an interviewers trick. Ask a very specific question that nobody would be able to answer on the spot and/or ask about a complex issue but phrase the question in a way that requires the person to give a simple answer. Potentially painting them in to a corner.



One of the best examples of this was when David Cameron asked Ed Balls something like ""Name one business leader who supports Labour."" 



Ed Balls froze completely and became the laughing stock of Parliament and the newspapers the next day when he said ""Bill something"".

I'm sorry and I will probably get downvoted but there is no way this many calls that are so clear cut can go against us. They dragged City right back into the title race with these calls. It's not all on the referees but we've been robbed more than anyone. It's not just bad refereeing across the premier league because how many teams can complain that they are being cheated by bad decisions week in and week out? If you were impartial and had no slant towards respecting the authority then you would think something is up. Even in the games that we win/draw we have decisions go against us.

What I get sick of is people trying to constantly take the side of the authority and blame it on bad performances. Are we going to say the 2009 Barca match was just a bad game?

It stands for Destructo Play -- once a team has retained possession in the offence zone of the field for a total of 20 minutes or 40% , whichever comes sooner, their coach has the option of calling a timeout and activating a Destructo Play, which allows his side to field an extra player, signed specifically for that purpose, until the ball goes out for a goalkick or five minutes has elapsed (the time is tracked by two giant spark emitters in the goalposts of the team against whom the Destructo Play has been called ). If the Destructo Player scores during this time, the scoring team will be awarded a further opportunity to kick a field goal (a long range shot from the halfway line against a keeper who must start on the edge of the box). This has no impact on the score of the game, but converted field goals translate into points that can be used during the Draft to secure the services of better players.


The importance of the Draft means that MLS teams are always keen to pick up players of long-range shooting ability to fill these slots in the roster — typically ageing foreign stars with a reputation for precision passing. The system was designed to encourage more attacking, exciting play from teams and for a while it was successful. However, in recent times, coaches have opted to sit on their Destructo Play once activated, preferring to use it to counter a similar call from their opposite number, which has led to more 12 vs 12 encounters than the rule's creators had intended. This is especially problematic in the US, where soccer is generally played on shared American Football fields, which are about three-quarters the size of English football pitches and lie East-West rather than the customary North-South European configuration.

-------------------------------------------
1 Here you can see as LA Galaxy's Destructo Player Juninho celebrates scoring on the Seattle Soufflés during a Destructo Play. With less than 30 seconds of the play remaining, and with Seattle having called a corridor of uncertainty, Juninho really had his work cut out to sprint back to the 50 yard line and size up his field conversion attempt, which he duly despatched with aplomb after the touch judge ruled a mulligan .

2 Some people have expressed confusion about what the 40% figure refers to, which surprised me because I thought the EA Fanmeter system had been rolled out to all leagues. You live and learn, I guess! As part of a promotional tie-in with the MLS and Microsoft, fans are encouraged to play along with the game on their x-box one, taking advantage of its next-gen picture-in-picture technology to watch the match at the same time. EA's fanmeter keeps track of the combined possessional stats of those digital games, which are then factored into the destructo stats after weighting for fan-base and other factors. The system's come in for some criticism, but mainly because they dropped its main selling point early on, which is that one lucky player could win the right to control a designated on-field player through a complex system of electrodes attached to various muscle-points and nerve endings and controlled wirelessly by the fan. Unfortunately, in the pilot game, a noisome 12 year old irk screwed it up for everyone when he forced Landon Donovan to slide tackle several opposing players off the ball, members of his own team, the referee and former pop-top-of-the Slash , who was performing an ad-break guitar solo for the home fans.


3 To the grammar stickler that messaged me, there certainly should not have been an oxford comma here; Slash was officiating the match as is common for US celebrities with some British residual ancestry. Those new to the game are often surprised to discover that foreign referees are not well-known famouses. With a polished figure like Mark Clattenburg, it's easy to assume he has had some prior success in a different sport, or Cricket, but many Americans experience acute cognitive dissonance as they try to work out what on earth Phil Dowd could possibly have achieved celebrity in.

4 Some people asked what happens to the Destructo Player once the Destructo buzzer has sounded to mark the end of that passage of play. Under the latest revision of the rule by MLS Commissioner Bobby Rustles, the player must immediately go inactive or risk costing his team a forfeit penalty. In practice, this means the player drops to the floor straight away, to await removal by the stretcher team, as the compliance official monitors his removal for signs of illegal motion. After Destructo Players have scored, you will frequently see scenes like this one, as the San Jose Sans Esperes carried their motionless goal-scoring Destructo Carson Winswatsonsson from the field like some paraplegic prince: https://i.imgur.com/xCm4GQs.gif

Instead, I would go along BGR and make a left just before the junction, towards SHS Overground station and then end up on Commercial Street northbound. You can then make a left turn onto Leonard St &gt; Featherstone St &gt; Banner St and go up Golden Lane &gt; Central Street &gt; Lever.

Only 4 nationals spots for 8 first teams and a few 2nd teams looking to make a name for themselves means there will be at least a few teams going home disappointed. 

Bath are clearly the strongest team on paper after getting 2 teams into indoors div 1 and with a large core of the team having played well for club teams over summer (Watt, Ryle, Nicholas - all played on the reading team that went to euros. Mike Guise - KaPow. And plenty more gaining experience on teams such as Bristol and Devon.) They are a tall and athletic team with plenty of options especially on the offensive side of the disc and should do well at regional and national level.

Bristol will be favourites for the 2nd Div 1 spot with a squad full of athletes. However they may find that they struggle for experience and a controlling presence with Josh Kyme having graduated last year. This is a team that it's defense should be good enough to give themselves plenty of chances to score and carry them to the win.

Outside the top 2 Plymouth, Exeter and Southampton are all good teams with plenty of good players but just might lack the squad depth and experience  to topple the big 2 and nick a div 1 spot. But if any of the these teams step up and make some big plays there is always the chance of an upset.

In the Andy Moss led Bournemouth squad you can guaranteed a hard working team who were good fun to watch at indoors with a variety of zones and iso's to keep things interesting. If they take that over into outdoors they certainly won't be an easy team to beat.

Next up we have 2 teams that are new to the regionals scene in FXU  and UWE. FXU (falmouth - i think...) have been slowly picking up experience at a variety of indoors tournaments but are yet to test themselves in the harsh windy world of outdoors. Sophie Wharton will be out to show the guys what is what after a summer trip to worlds with Nice Bristols with the rest of the squad keen to show they are no pushovers either.

2) What is your favorite food/dish from your country? Curry. Definitely some of those Currys.

3) What type of music is popular where you are from? Who is your favorite music artist? All kinds of music is popular here, from Pop, Rock, Country etc. My Favourite artist has to be Chuck Ragan.

4) Are there any holidays that you celebrate in your country that we do not in the United States? Ash Tuesday and all the holidays associated with Easter and the Crucifixion of Christ? That's a religious holiday but I'm not sure whether it's something you guys follow due to separation of state etc. erm, people are most likely to say Guy Fawkes, etc but we don't actually get any ""Holiday"" for them or are they National Holidays. So I dunno what counts?

5) Are there holidays that are celebrated in the U.S. that are celebrated a bit differently in your country? Christmas is a lot more excessive, you guys do Halloween like a massive holiday whereas it's only just gaining popularity over here.

 6) What is the most positive thing about being a member of your culture? British culture? English culture? I suppose there will be things that constitute a ""British"" Culture to you, but I don't really recognise them because I'm living them. You'd have to compare two cultures to be able to recognise what's typical of each one.

 7) What are some things young people do for fun in your country? Pretty much the same things as people do in America for fun. Go out with their friends, drinking (18+ - though there's a lot of underage drinking), parties, cinema, music festivals/concerts.

8) Are there any special customs involved with weddings/funerals/births where you are from? Not really. We tend to follow a Church of England way of doing things (unless you vehemently against any form of organised religion some part of taking part in one of those ceremonies is going to involve an ideal from the Church) but that's hard to explain to someone and I'm not sure whether saying ""have a look at Protestant weddings/funerals/christenings"" is going to help you?

9) Are there any stereotypes about your country that you feel are not true? What are they? We're not all football yobbos, we're not all tea drinking (I hate the stuff) and we don't even always eat tiny sandwiches at lunchtime.

Modern farming techniques are [basically long term unsustainable](http://gaia.pge.utexas.edu/papers/ThermodynamicsofAgricultural.pdf) due to things like soil depletion, damage to ecosystems and the fact that large-scale monocultures are fundamentally unstable, and are basically begging nature to kick you in the ass.  This is a really serious set of issues that we'll face over the next few decades, and at the moment we're busy running our national farming industry into the ground due to a series of fucked-up market led policies.  Add climate change making growing things that much more difficult in a number of places, and the fact that we're busy fishing the oceans into new ecosystem states (something which aquaculture is accelerating) and it's looking like Paul Ehrlich's worst nightmare times about 10.

Hell, we've already had a recent wave of revolutions triggered by a combination of food price and drought in the middle east.  That should really have set alarm bells ringing and triggered a load more funding and research into more long-term sustainable agriculture, but nothing so far.

The trouble will come from getting enough possession in the midfield areas to get it up to the strikers.

Le sigh. Ok, this is my last reply to you, then you can go back to arguing about comic book characters. I'll just make this one a simple timeline to summarise. 

1) Possible shitpost. 

2) I call out shitpost. 

3) OP insists not shitpost. 

4) I reply to say no offense, but I doubt it was posted for the funny lols of it given he's an SNP supporter. OP posts no further. 

5) Guy accuses me of making it political by being the only one mentioning the SNP. 

6) Pointed out to guy that this is wrong since I'm referencing the *article* which makes an issue of it. 

7) Despite being wrong, guy's incorrect post is upvoted. My posts previously at positive score suddenly turn negative. Hence, downvote brigade. 

8) I remark at this behaviour. Upvotes to pro-SNP statements vs. sudden downvotes on my posts have inverse correlation. I speculate this is stupid SNP supporters given my experience of the political bias of reddit. 

9) You get a hard-on for me and call me a prick for being inflamatory. Reply constantly and try to convince me the world hates me and that I'm the wrong one with political bias etc etc. 

10) I dick about with you all afternoon while you reel out pop-psycho-analysis about my motivations, culminating in the assertion that it's all for attention. 

11) I mock you, then go home. 

Seriously, *me* creating an 'Us vs. them' mentality? Have you seen *any* statement made by the SNP in the last 5 years? It's *all* an Us. vs. Them mentality, and one which is seemingly propagated gladly by its supporters. It's the very essence of a national, tribal, inward-looking party, you blundering dolt.

That is not what I am saying and tried to address in my previous reply. I am not claiming you don't know what that feels like to support a local team or the Sox, and to ""live and die"" by a team is not what I am getting at either. 

But to know what it feels like for *Spurs*, to grow up a Spurs/Football fan in this culture, to be born into a country and culture that lives and breathes for *Football* while barely acknowledging any other sport (vs many segmented individual sports in the US such as the NBA, NFL, MLB), a single sport that divides and unites the country through good and bad, one that is the common ground and conversation starter for *all* men everywhere across the country so much so you are looked at as a bit strange if you *don't* follow football, a sport that was truly birthed here with one of the worlds first competitive leagues appearing in the 1800's.

The entire **country** lives for football and has done for centuries, this creates a Football culture that simply has to be experienced and cannot be put into words as much as I try. Can you honestly say that state-side there is one sport that unites the entire nation, where the culture of the country revolves around it? Can you say that about MLS? Or NFL? Or NBA? Or MLB? Or NHL?

I don't think it's a matter of coincidence that we swapped formations and immediately had our shit together.  I think the new formation does a very good job of covering some blatantly obvious weaknesses in our players while simultaneously playing to their strengths.

If no one can finish well then it's not going to matter if you have 17 shots per game or 13, your odds of finishing 1 in 4 are still shit.  The fact the number has improved points to that we're creating more high quality chances that are easier to finish.  Our guys will finish the 1 in 5 gilt edged chances they get, but probably convert maybe 1 in 10 half chances whereas someone with a more predatory finishing ability would be 2, 3, or 4 out of 10 on the half chances and perfect or near perfect on the gilt-edged ones.

The system made the biggest difference because it gave the players the proper support throughout the pitch to actually do what they're good at instead of ask them to overextend.  Coutinho's job isn't different, but the space, players, and movement around him is different.  Skrtel's job is also the same, but the support he has around him and in front of him don't leave him entirely exposed and unable to do his job now.  This is because we have players getting into the right areas to stretch defenses and constrict offenses.  It was not happening in the 4-2-3-1, nor did it look like it was ever going to happen.  The players were playing bad, but they were getting no help from the setup to improve.  Asking a player like Martin Skrtel to keep track of basically a full flank of the pitch when we transition into a defensive phase basically all on his own is insane, he can't and won't ever be able to do it, but he'll try, and fail, and then it's going to knock his confidence.  Similarly, asking a player like Coutinho to sit on the wing and wait for play to come to him destroys his game because he's one that doesn't stop/start well, he finds a rhythm and needs to be involved to get going properly.  

We did play Lucas in the 4-2-3-1 months ago.  Him and Gerrard sat in the middle of the pitch on a number of occasions and we still looked very frail through the middle.  It didn't work at all and it was so bad many wanted Lucas sold.  The box midfield plus 3 players central in the back line stifles the middle of the pitch so much that our guys like Lucas, who isn't a very mobile player at this point, can just destroy what's around them without having to go 35 yards across the pitch chasing someone first.

You need 4 or 5 good answers for a grade 1, so 1 or 2 from mechanics / statistics and 3 or 4 from the pure section is reasonable.

You can't renounce citizenship to make yourself stateless. Renouncing citizenship has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with making yourself stateless.

It's completely impossible.

Britain is a signatory to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, and 1960 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, meaning its natural born citizens cannot be made stateless.

Only the very expensive jackets, boots and trousers actually keep the rain out. After 30-45mins of riding, the water always finds its way in. 

A plastic over suit works best if you don't mind looking like a human condom but over trousers and over jacket will work almost as well. 

Personally, I would invest heavily in goretex boots and gloves up front. They are the biggest hassle to add extra layers to, and it's much simpler to just have waterproof boots. 

I highly recommend Dainese's goretex boots. I have the TRQ gore-tex. I used to have some Oxford Bone Dry boots which lasted about 6 months before water started coming in and the toe slider fell off... 

Rukka are the daddy when it comes to wet weather gear but you pay through the nose. I'd avoid Spada. I've never had s good product from them and I'm not alone.  

- good helmet: Shoei, Arai, Shark, AGV, Schuberth
- Good goretex liner jacket (or leather/kevlar + plastic over jacket) 
- goretex lines trousers (or textile/leather + plastic overs)
- goretex lined leather boots
- goretex lined leather gauntlet gloves
- thermal base layer 
- neck tube/buff or two (A MUST) 
- wooly socks
- earplugs (seriously, wear them) 

Would be my list. 
For the bike. I'd recommend Oxford heated grips. They are 100% worth it. Wire them up to your headlight, so you can't leave them on. 
This will be controversial but I disliked using a top box on my 125. It just contributed to being blown around in side winds. 

I've always preferred a backpack and/or a tailpack. Kriega make the best of both. 

When it comes to boots, helmet and gloves. I would say spending big but buying once is advisable. Go for the best. 

For everything else, you can build up as time goes on. ",null,0,null,1424795149,null,0,false,0,covn78x,null,t3_2wt8uh,null,t1_covn78x,null,t3_2wt8uh,null,null,null,1427429223,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

You can't renounce citizenship to make yourself stateless. Renouncing citizenship has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with making yourself stateless. Unless Britain recognises ISIS as a state and not a terrorist organisation (never going to happen), no British citizen can renounce their British citizenship to join the Islamic State. It's completely impossible.

Britain is a signatory to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, and 1960 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, meaning its natural born citizens cannot be made stateless.

British citizens **cannot** renounce their citizenship to make themselves stateless. If you think they can, **provide evidence** that is specific to UK law and not some random paragraph you've taken out of context from Wikipedia.

With this ruling, it effectively tells one partner they should not sacrifice anything because in the event of a divorce they will be much much worse off.

One partner often makes sacrifices, for example moving to a new city/country because the other partner has been offered a much better job.

There was a feature article on the BBC website that had the most curious mixed messages on this subject. On the one, hand, the article spent a large amount of copy talking about how terrible it is that the make up of MPs is so unrepresentative of the general population- while back in the 1970s the Commons was packed full of miners, tradespeople, trade unionists, and so forth, now it is far more uniformly rich public school boys and lawyers. It then went on to bemoan that the salary was ""so low"" that it could never hope to attract the best and brightest business people and highest-flyers. It seems to me that a 95th percentile salary is more than attractive enough for the vast unrepresented masses of working people out there, and if it's low enough that it puts off a few of the vastly over-represented class of wealthy business owners, lawyers and financiers then no harm done.

&gt; You can't renounce citizenship to make yourself stateless. Renouncing citizenship has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with making yourself stateless. Unless Britain recognises ISIS as a state and not a terrorist organisation (never going to happen), no British citizen can renounce their British citizenship to join the Islamic State. It's completely impossible.
&gt; 
&gt; Britain is a signatory to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, and 1960 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, meaning its natural born citizens cannot be made stateless.

&gt; If you think they can, provide evidence that is specific to UK law and not some random paragraph you've taken out of context from Wikipedia.
&gt; 
&gt; British citizens cannot renounce their citizenship to make themselves stateless.
&gt; 

I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure there is nothing in either Convention about preventing citizens from renouncing citizenship and becoming stateless, only about rescinding citizenship by the state. 

Also, from [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality/overview) you can renounce British citizenship if:

* you’re *going to get* another citizenship or nationality after giving up your British citizenship or status""

Emphasis mine.

If these girls have been groomed and for all intents and purposes tricked into this then that's a terrible shame. But I can't help but feel it could have been avoided with a little better parent intervention but even then that merely avoids the problem of why they feel the need to leave a country like the UK to go to, pardon my french, a fucking middle eastern shithole warzone.

No. 

We used to be one party waaay back, before I was even born, but the parties split maybe 25 years ago? 

The parties are different because the greens believe in local democracy, and in this case 'local' means the smallest feasible 'block'. SGP supported independence, and the rise in members post referendum will be from pro-Yes people. So the chances of a merger are lower than they have ever been.  

The political climate north and south of the border is different enough that different parties make sense. But we are heavily influenced by one another, and a successful and not so mental SGP performance in Holyrood will definitely filter through to the E&amp;W Greens. The large membership rise will certainly help too, the more the hippy factions are diluted by the 'red' factions the better tbh. The reds have controlled SGP for quite some time now, and the experiences in Holyrood have been very positive influences on the party, professionalising us a lot.

How is this statement related to our discussion?

&gt;The green party will not get into power, but just the fact that they have support is a bad sign. Just like UKIP.

The rise of fringe groups like UKIP and the Greens is, objectively speaking, not proven to be good or bad yet. It could turn out to be a great thing for British politics, for all we know.

Ultimately I think this reflects more on herd mentality, and the state of our partisan press. My answer to this is, don't believe everything you read/watch on the news. Remember that most media outlets have to: 

a) sell newspapers / get hits 

b) adhere to political allegiances dictated by their owners

1. I think a lot of Americans don't understand English humour and are very sensitive about it. As Jester said, English humour is very sarcastic and most of you miss that and just get offended.

2. I don't quite think a lot of you understand how deep Spurs runs throughout some of our families. You may buy shirts, get up early to watch games and even come visit and you know what? Good on you, we're all supporters. However, Spurs has run through my families for generations... it's not just a football team... it's part of my genetics by now. This team is one of the strongest bonding tools between my family so I don't expect some Americans to understand the sentiment. (Not saying you don't have the equivalent with NFL/NBA teams etc but this is about Spurs)

3. This is just a personal one for me... but I can't stand the pandering I see to rivals on /r/soccer and sometimes this sub. I'm not talking about saying that another team has good players because we all appreciate talented footballers. It's seeing people who I see posting here writing us off to rival fans just for the sake of karma. Yeah, we're not going to win every game but you don't tell people on these posts that you expect us to lose, point out players who you dislike and then say that the other team is going to smash us. 

4.  This follows on from the previous post. People who get all eggy and uptight when people post pictures or comments that shit on rivals and then they get downvoted because ""Oh my god... why are you shitting on a rival...."". Like, really? They're called rivals for a reason! We don't like them! That's the point!

null,false,OhHiGCHQ,scot-Lothian,Lothian,null,"What's happened is that these girls have joined a cult, and with cults once you are sufficiently indoctrinated facts like murderous acts of terrorism seem to fly over ones head. How many new Scientologists have heard of Scientology's cult practices beforehand? 

The simple fact of the matter is that ISIS is indoctrinating people not in Mosques, not in schools, not in Livingrooms, but on the internet, in people's bedrooms. By getting these girls over to Syria they are separating them from the people who could challenge their indoctrination.

I don't think the parents knew about it, they most likely, like most parents weren't monitoring their internet use, nor would the girls be all ""Bye Dad, I'm going away to fight ISIS"". They may have been naive and they may have not expected their daughter to do such a thing, but that's parents for you.

What we need to remember is that ISIS, as a cult, won't let members leave on their own free will. With ISIS, when they are being indoctrinated online they are presented with a wonderland, told and convinced that all they have heard on the news is a lie and ISIS is in fact Jannah on earth and enticed over to Syria. As a cult, like cults usually do, ISIS preys on the young, the naive, the vulnerable, those desperate to change their lives. One piece of propaganda from ISIS said ""It doesn't matter what you did in the past"", aiming at indoctrinating those who were involved in crime or maybe drugs. Once you start seeing ISIS as a cult, you start to understand why ISIS can bring people over to Syria despite the news about them. This happens a lot with other movements, some not even cults. How many time have you seen people presented with news or facts against their views and dismiss it as ""enemy propaganda"". ""Oh, big pharma is just saying that to stop you believing the truth"", ""This is left wing lies, Reaganomics works"".

Once in Syria, they are in an environment controlled, more or less by ISIS. They get their information from ISIS sources exclusively, they only contact people under ISIS supervision. Many fall deeper into ISIS, others get the wool pulled from their eyes and want to leave, but of course, if you say ""I want to go home"" and the people that be believe you to be not indoctrinated enough, you'll get killed as a traitor. They'll only let you leave if you plan to carry out an attack. Members of ISIS are going to come back at some point, either because they plan to carry out an attack or because they have become disillusioned and really we can't stop them, they'll find a way. What we should do is track them and find out if or when they get back to the UK or Europe. Then, once on British soil we arrest them. Once in custody we can examine the situation, charge them, put them into prison and de radicalise them and get them out of the cult.

In short, what we have with ISIS isn't a case of people watching the news and going ""That sounds lovely"", what we have is a cult, a cult that indoctrinates people and rewires their minds over the internet to believe the bullshit they peddle over the truth. Once we start treating ISIS like a cult, then we can properly deal with them.",null,0,null,1424799027,null,0,false,0,covplid,null,t3_2wz2zg,null,t1_covplid,null,t3_2wz2zg,null,null,null,1427430340,null,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24,null

1) I think Natalie should go. It's February, the election is not until May/June, there's time for a new person to come in and make an impact.

I'm sorry to say that because I like Natalie but her resigning would wipe the slate clean in the public eyes, her staying means that the Greens will be judged based on the Neill interview and the LBC interview.

Unfortunately I suspect the Greens are too nice and too openly structured to be able to do this ruthlessly (in the way Thatcher was rather brutally removed by the Conservative men in grey suits). So it will only happen if Natalie voluntarily chooses to resign ""on health grounds.""

2) Greens who will be interviewed need much better support and briefing. Part of my job is to prepare people for job interviews. I get them to analyse what the employer will want to know and predict what questions are likely to come up, give them a list of the 10 most common interview questions and run mock interviews, giving them feedback afterwards. It doesn't look like anyone is doing this for Natalie, she seems totally unprepared for the most obvious interview questions. I also get them to do post-mortems and improve for next time. (Natalie failed to answer exactly the same line of questioning in the LBC interview as she did against Neill so this is clearly not happening for her).

 I know she has the information sent to her, Clive Lord mentioned doing so on his blog. But having information as part of a huge email inbox is one thing, being practised and ready to handle interview questions is quite another (as anyone who has fluffed a job interview can confirm). She needs coaching and support from a good political PR person.

And besides, if DC thinks having an expertise in something outside of parliament, then why did he make an MP who was elected at the age of 26 a minister at 28 (Chloe Smith).",null,0,null,1424799481,null,0,false,0,covpvod,null,t3_2wygh0,null,t1_covpvod,null,t1_covfnhz,null,null,null,1427430543,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

The largest single figure you give, the £40bn in the shadow economy, could also be addressed in terms of giving ordinary people a fairer chance - make it easier for self-employed people to earn a decent wage - a universal income, high tax free allowance, NI credits, more graduated higher tax rates etc., which encourage low and middle earners to work, and to pay fair taxes on their earnings - as well as making the very wealthy pay a fair share.

Edit - I forgot to say in my first reply - The other reason why people focus on 'the big bad corps not paying their fair share', is that aside from these many billions of illegal / quasi-illegal avoidance, there are many examples of loopholes, special arrangements, sweetheart deals, etc. etc. that reveal to the public, a reality where a big corp can (and does) effectively get away with not paying tax, in a way that an ordinary Joanne / Joe on PAYE simply cannot do.",null,0,null,1424801078,null,0,1424801279,0,covqvui,null,t3_2wusky,null,t1_covqvui,null,t1_cov9714,null,null,null,1427431011,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

The oil price shocks in the 1970s damaged the British economy and destroyed the post war consensus. This led to a seismic shift in British politics. I'm convinced this contributed to corporate subsidies, low wages and the housing crisis.

The oil price shock was set up by an agreement between the US and KSA in 1973, and kicked off by the 1973 Arab–Israeli War. 

This is something of an accident of history though: if the US and UK had managed to keep Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in power then we could be blaming Iran instead. 

I wasn't on about that originally though. I was more thinking about us being sucked into expensive and pointless adventures in the middle east, and particularly the role of KSA in funding 9/11 and Islamic State.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_Youth


&gt;As German casualties escalated with the combination of Operation Bagration and the Lvov-Sandomierz Operation in the east, and Operation Cobra in the west, members of the Hitlerjugend were recruited at ever younger ages. By 1945, the Volkssturm was commonly drafting 12-year-old Hitler Youth members into its ranks.During the Battle of Berlin, Axmann's Hitler Youth formed a major part of the last line of German defense, and were reportedly among the fiercest fighters. Although the city commander, General Helmuth Weidling, ordered Axmann to disband the Hitler Youth combat formations, in the confusion this order was never carried out. The remnants of the youth brigade took heavy casualties from the advancing Russian forces; only two survived.[15]

No it's not - hopefully they are thinking though that the rest of the regiment is well trained and prepared for combat, not that their comrades were all recruited on the basis of something that has nothing to do with military skill.

Why does this have to be achieved by a gimmick that you've pretty much acknowledged to be pointless? I'm all for boosting Sikh recruitment, but positing a 'Sikh-only' regiment as the answer is as patronising and unnecessary as positing a 'Black-only' regiment to boost black recruitment.

Please don't invoke Godwin's law so early in the conversation. If you've been paying attention then you'd note we've been playing ""whack-a-mole"" with the forces that want an Islamic state for over a decade now. Afghanistan and Somalia, now Iraq/Syria.  
In terms of ""real threats"" to the UK they rank at the bottom. They have their state, they do their fucked up shit there and that's what they want. The Al-Queda group out in Syria have specifically cut off ties with them due to a difference in vision which is partly their isolationist approach.  

If anyone really gave a crap about ""stopping terrorism"" then the most obvious solution is to just stop getting involved in proxy wars. We'll smack them down later if they genuinely start exerting pressure in their borders, for now we're all just watching the Syria/Iraq civil war and to be frank considering how its going I very much doubt ISIS will win it.

I think it's entirely fair to say that that's pretty clear evidence that no party really wants to do anything about the issue, other than farm sound bites.
 
&gt; Back when I ran a small business, I did all my tax and VAT. I'd have been terrified of strict liability. As far as I know I never got anything wrong, but there was quite a learning curve. Could this be done in a way that didn't impact too much on SMEs?

I don't think anyone with half a brain expects people to never get anything wrong.  Tax can be spectacularly complicated, although to be fair it's not too bad for most traders.

The easiest way to make it safe for small traders would be a lower limit.  Say, strict liability comes in only if your turnover is over £1m, or the under-assessed tax in any year is over £10,000.  I'd say a small trader would be hard pressed to make a genuine mistake that big.  

Make it £50,000, even!  I'm fairly relaxed about under-assessed tax at the lower end, because the money tends to stay in circulation.  Imagine a plumber who should declare a profit of £40,000, but only declares £30,000.  The tax loss is £2,000, but what does he do with that money?  He spends it.  It goes in his local shops, or pubs, or to his employees.  All those people are a bit better off and they get taxed.

When you start getting into the sort of avoidance that involves offshore structures that money goes out of circulation in the local economy.
 
&gt; I'm concerned about conflict of interest if the Big Four are further involved in drafting legislation. One of my worries about the Health and Social Care Act 2012 was the deep involvement of KPMG.

I don't really like it much, myself.  The problem though is this:  HMRC can't afford the very best people.  No political party is ever going to agree to let HMRC pay the kind of salaries that are needed for them to.  *(Although they're all surprisingly relaxed about bankers' bonuses, on the basis they're needed to hire the best.)*

This being the case, HMRC can't recruit and retain the caliber of staff needed.  Although people think of MPs as the writers of legislation, there's not a single MP I know of with the right level of evidence and tax expertise to do the job.  And that's just finding one.  No one person is capable of the work, even if you could find them.  So, it seems to me that the choice is then either you get substandard legislation, or you hire in the right expertise.  And the only way I can see that working is to hire it in from the Big Four.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"It really depends on how you measure 'success', but in this context I guess it is the measure of personal financial achievement, based purely on individualism. Is your family, community, civilisation successful? Is it your problem? The human construct of wealth was designed and has evolved to allow select individuals (and their chosen group) freedom from the burden of others and all moral responsibility, but we are a social species and you can't exist alone. Without the poor, there are no rich.

Having ownership of a revenue stream and ciphering off a share of the surplus, does not require any skill or experience. The CEMD of a corporation can not make their business non-profit, by investing the surplus back into the business or just reducing the price of their service/product, because 'that person' could never get to that position to do it. This system has evolved to be resilient to negative capital change, only supporting growth and the players that enforce it. That is Business. It existed before you and will exist after you.

In the game of Capitalism, one's success is surely another one's failure. If you don't play the game and climb the ladder, someone else will and every position will be filled by default. Its hard not to be sucked in because we are all bombarded with capitalist propaganda our whole life. Capitalism needs us to respond to it and we do. In the UK we are all dependant consumers, who need the sweet nectar products of Capitalism. Of course individual people are not the problem, our economic system is too complex and uncontrollable, which generates a lot of waste.

Getting rich in the UK is as much about gambling and chance as it is about hard work, though some people will have better odds than others, so is 'success' getting rich or staying rich? The latter is much easier, but at what point are you 'rich'. This shows that 'success' and 'rich' are quite subjective and dynamic terms, which only manage to stratify society. Today with technology and communication, everyone could be 'comfortable' and this pointless game of relentless work would become redundant. 

By considering yourself 'successful' or 'rich' you are alienating yourself from society. In 100 years, you will be dead and wealth does not pay for an afterlife. If you have accumulated wealth for self preservation, only to protect you and yours, then IMO you have 'failed'.

Answering the actual question: No, in the same way as the unsuccessful should not pay for 'their' personal enrichment via the state. Therefore, if you want to be rich, fine. F**k off and surround yourself with other poor people. This country should aim for equality and that means bringing everyone towards an average.

(1) In The Power of Three we meet the Shakri. Now, let's just establish some common observations from that episode. The Shakri are known as a myth to the Gallifreyans, an equivalent to the boogeyman. They clearly possess the ability to travel through space and time, and, in contrast to our post-Time Wars Doctor, are capable of moving between parallel universes.

Now, Whovians have long been wanting a new, scary-villain, since a number of the recent Cyberman, Weeping Angel, and Dalek plot lines have seemingly missed that mark. Who better? We're talking about a race more powerful than the Daleks (who never became *quite* as advanced in traveling time and space as the Time Lords), with tech equal to (or possibly even more advanced than) than the technology of the Time Lords, and who Gallifrey, as a whole, fears to such an extent that they were immortalized in legend. 

Think about it: They are the ""exterminators"" of the universe. They even felt that humanity was a plague on the universe. It's not much of a stretch if their attention turned towards the Doctor after the events of The Power of Three.


(2) It has been implied in the lead up to the 50th Special, and here and there during Matt Smith's run, that the Doctor's anger and his desire to save those he thinks of as innocent and good has resulted in him being seen as a warrior on some planets, rather than a healer and protector. I would like to see them travel to one such planet, and see how the Doctor reacts to that. It would fit in perfectly with Capaldi's recent struggles over good and bad. 


(3) Bring back Captain Jack, and while some may say this doesn't qualify as a Never Happened thing, I mean bring him back now. Barrowman, while he's aged well, definitely looks older, and it would give them a chance to meet a young Face of Bo. Before his body deteriorates.


(4) Actually *do something* with the Valeyard. Doctor v. Bizzaro-Doctor outside of a silly  Gallifreyan court case. Who wouldn't love that?


Edit: (5) Oh, and I almost forgot... I really want to see the Doctor doing something with the Church of the Papal Mainframe. That was such a cool thing, but it served only a supporting role in the Christmas Special... I'd love to see it take main-stage.

So, that's what I've got...

This was either a 3 game offense or a 0 game revocation. By taking the middle road FA are giving us special treatment while not giving us special treatment at all. The game that matters is the next one, thats why we appealed and that what we wanted. They made sure we wouldn't get that while still showing that they bent over for us. We got played for Matic playing 1 game.


In the next few days try saying Chelsea get fucked by the referees and the FA without an imbecile saying how we just got special treatment for Matic heck try saying it months from now.


This is in a way the worst outcome. It would have been benifitial to us if it was 3 games as it puts pressure on all outside parties (press, referees, media) to side with us or if it was 0 games because then we would have won. In this case we got peanuts while everyone will think we just had a favor done.

It tends to be that many of these developments were conceived with the best of intentions, but a budget cut here and a change of administration there, an incompetent bureaucrat one year and a factory closure the next, these are the thousand cuts that condemned them to ignominy.

The much maligned social housing schemes (at least, the good ones rather than the myriad cheap rip-offs) were groundbreaking, deeply ideological architecture, born from the belief that a person's environment could have a transformative positive effect. 'Streets in the sky' on which children could play safely, schools, clinics and shopping arcades mere moments away, airy rooms with large windows; these things were baked into the design of the best of the brutalist tower blocks, and they were immeasurably better than what preceded them.

Councils desperate to find housing but with no real understanding of architecture saw these buildings for something else; cheap, often largely prefabricated, high-density places to shove people to meet targets.

The flaw in the good buildings was that the programs and maintenance that were supposed to complement them were distastefully expensive or high-effort for councils, particularly in the 80s when the shine had worn off. The 'broken windows' effect came into full force. The things that encourage people to treat the spaces they live with dignity were just not happening. The flaw with the bad buildings is that they were always bad, destined to crumble, ill-lit, stricken with bottlenecks, and never treated like they were worth anything at all. 

If we want social housing to be valuable and improve lives, we can't build it and forget it. That is the mistake of the past.

Sometimes we say that the table lies or statistics don't tell the whole story, and sometimes that's correct. But separate what you've seen on the pitch and what the reality of the current situation is.

Chelsea are five points clear in the league with a favourable schedule remaining. We have officially entered the business end of the season. We've dropped just four points at home and have already made trips to Manchester and Merseyside. While you cannot write anyone off in this league -- especially those in danger off the drop zone ; on paper those fixtures would appear to be more straight forward. 
Yes the team has struggled to win matches recently, but form is temporary and even if mistakes were made now there is still time to right the ship.  This side has real quality and I think they have the ability to raise their level of play come March April and May.  You must believe that we will rediscover our goal scoring ways and that we'll learn to defend late leads because those characteristics were emblematic of our strengths over the past 18 months. In statistics we use a term called regression to the mean, that describes how temporary behavior will eventually give way to long rooted behavior.

You could use a salary sacrifice to buy childcare vouchers tax free, which would be similar to the dependent care deduction.  That'd get you within about £5,000 of the deductions they're claiming, leaving you with about £45,000.

If the income was split evenly you'd have £10,000 each tax free, so tax would be due on £25,000.  The tax on that would be £5,000.

They aren't saying they WANT a zero growth economy just that should zero or negative growth occur a basic income will mean we are more able to withstand it. 

Rail re-nationalisation is very workable and should mean the railways cost the govt less.  The govt spent more on the railways now after privatization than it did before, so renationalisation would save the govt money.

&gt; In 1994, the total government support received by BR was £1,627m,[14] (£2,168m in 2005 terms, adjusted by RPI[15]), while in 2005, government support from all sources totalled £4,593m https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation_of_British_Rail

Also Isn't UK rail much less efficient than Nationalised rail of other countries? 

&gt;Perhaps the UK's extortionate prices would be justified if it led to a greater quality and efficiency of service. But the government-commissioned McNulty report found a 40 per cent ""efficiency gap"" between the UK and Europe’s rail systems. Other independent reports in 2010 and 2012 found the UK’s rail system amongst the worst in Europe for efficiency and comfort. http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/our-rail-system-is-broken-and-nationalisation-has-already-been-proven-to-work--so-what-are-we-waiting-for-9960432.html

Reduction of military spending would get my vote and should get yours. We haven't been attacked by another nation for decades and there hasn't been a serious attack since ww2. Yet military spending keeps growing to finance aggressive wars of mass murder, how anyone can think we should even be allowed a military after the genocide in iraq I dont know, people seem to have memories of goldfish. 

Raising the minimum wage to £10 would be an excellent policy that wouldn't cost the govt much and provide a massive demand side economic stimulu, putting money in peoples pockets so they can spend and create jobs, instead of just propping up the equity values of the rich like the current batshit insane economic policy of quantatative easing supported by the other parties does.

If you fancy eating somewhere that feels a little bit more upmarket but still a casual feel then you could try Poco on Stokes Croft, which serves really nice tapas made from all organic and local produce.

Alternatively, download an app called wriggle for your phone and see what drink and food deals are available around that area of Bristol on the day.

* Tuesday, start work around 10am because I had a late night last night. Again, nothing but pants. Maybe a shirt on during a meeting if there was one. Or lie and say my webcam wouldn't work in Linux for some reason. Work till 6pm. Get to bed around 3am because it was student night in town.
* Wednesday, start work around 11am but be groggy as hell because it was student night last night. Hangovers suck. Work till 8pm because of starting late and having a hangover slowed me down. Because I didn't finish work till late, and I missed out on TV time last night, get to bed around 3 again.
* Thursday, much like wednesday really. Except we're out again tonight for the different club/pubs student night. Get to bed around 4am! Metal clubs opening hours rock.
* Friday, start work around 12. Shit, shower, ~~shave~~ trim, because the girlfriend is coming back tonight (she was living at her mums at the time, it was better for work). Finish work around 7pm because that's when she got home. Head out for a big night of drinking.
* Saturday and Sunday result in a blur of drinking and bedroom fun times (because the girlfriend wasn't there during the week).
* Because I have no idea what's going on by Sunday late in the day, just stay up all night. Around 7am put coffee and bacon on to cook.

Mine is that British citizen *can* make themselves stateless, whether dual nationals, nationalised citizens or British born. 

The evidence they need to provide is that they *intend to* take up another nationality, not that they have already taken up another nationality. They do not have to follow through on taking up another nationality should they not wish to do so. They categorically can make themselves stateless in spite of the Conventions you cited earlier.

&gt; So what's your point? You keep changing your argument so often it's hard to keep up!

Mine has also been the same from the beginning. I don't need to change my argument because it's a simple fact whether you want it to be or not.

British citizens *can* make themselves stateless.

Withholding rent during negotiations only postpones the payment until you reach an agreement.  You will still be liable to pay the rent, and the company may pursue you legally for any outstanding rent, which would affect your credit rating.  Bear in mind that the deposit won't 'write off' any breach of contract if you skip without paying in full - in fact the agency might both pursue you for the outstanding rent, and then also withhold the deposit against a diferent issue with the property. (not suggesting there are other issues, but agencies have a knack for finding things to justify withholding deposits if they want to...)

I think the only final option is to find a tenant to move in the day you leave, thus offsetting the 'loss' the agency will make by you leaving unexpectedly.

David Cameron is related to Boris Johnson and they were in the same year at Eton together. 
Look at all the connections on these photos.

Cameron is also a direct descendent of this man.

And how about Camerons wife, Samantha. 

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2738013/Why-never-10ft-one-Sam-Cam-s-racy-rellies-The-Astor-family-embedded-level-modern-beau-monde-writes-RICHARD-KAY.html

&gt;A century ago they were the wealthiest family in the U.S., if not the world, and the Astor name still holds immense sway in east coast America.

&gt;At the height of their influence, they were one of the five great American dynasties with the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Carnegies and Mellons.

&gt;Their wealth descended from fur trader John Jacob Astor, America’s first millionaire, and his property-investing sons and grandsons, who owned much of Manhattan.

&gt;One Astor, John Jacob IV who went down with the Titanic, and his cousin Waldorf Astor, bequeathed New York the double-barrelled Waldorf-Astoria hotel.

&gt;Until recently, America’s most recognised member of the clan was Brooke Astor, encouraged by her dying husband into ‘having fun after I’m dead by giving away money’. It was a vocation she took up with alacrity. By the time of her death in 2007, the ‘first lady of New York’ had lavished more than £100 million on good causes.

&gt;These days, there are few Astors left in the States. Most live in Britain, where their social and political influence are more subtle.

&gt;They established themselves here in the 1890s when William Waldorf sailed for Britain. He bought Cliveden, Hever Castle in Kent and the Observer newspaper.

&gt;His generosity to libraries and art galleries brought him a viscountcy from George V in 1917. 

&gt;Nancy, glamorous wife of his eldest son, William the 2nd Viscount, was Britain’s first woman MP. His second son, John, became the 1st Baron Astor of Hever.

So, just your average British family.

The more you look at our upper class, our government and industry, the more connections you find and the more thing start to make sense. They're friends, school chums or friends of friends. 

Same goes for QC's and judges, etc etc.  http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/aug/28/elitism-in-britain-breakdown-by-profession

All of Camerons education team were private educated. https://twitter.com/southportlabour/status/490859441106194432

This is just scratching the surface.

I guarantee you that Rifkind will get his job back as soon as the election is over. (or any job he likes)

The first one is ok; but could be pulled off a little better to visually represent the crack in the universe. Maybe engraving the outer edges, and only a few small emerald cut stones in the center. The unusual shape to the ring will cause issues with fitting the wedding band.

With that being said, I absolutely love the second option. It is simple enough that no one will sneer at it. If they are set in a band, then there is no issues of fitting the wedding ring next to it.

Other options that I have seen, that I thought were amazing, that might help:

Also, commercial housing development in this country is criminal IMO and should not be profiting the way it is, regardless of weather these people at the top are paying tax or not. In 50 years time when all the currently new houses need to be replaced because of poor construction and misguided planning, those that benefited from the development will be long gone.

Second-hand shops make money by getting items for free from well-meaning members of the public.  Generally people only donate these items to be sold for a cause they support.  Any attempt to be less than transparent about this cause is an abuse of trust.

Let me put it a different way.  Suppose I set up an entirely private second-hand shop, relying on the prevailing *assumption* that an organisation asking for donated goods must be raising funds for a good cause.

null,false,powatom,null,null,null,"Sweeping generalisations? Like what? Which part of my post is a sweeping generalisation? That most people don't question where their meat comes from? Does the horse meat 'scandal' not illustrate the problem well enough that people have little idea where their food comes from? What about all of the 'shock, horror' revelations over the years around animal cruelty at farms, which cause outrage temporarily and then are largely forgotten about?

Or are you talking about where I said that people care about animal welfare when it suits them? Caring about animals is incompatible with locking them in cages for years and then eating them, surely? What about raping cows repeatedly for years to produce calves which are then taken away from the mother (to be killed, usually) so that *we* can have the milk rather than their own young? Is that not what happens? It may not be nice to think that our 'instinctive preference' for meat directly harms animals, but isn't it a simple fact? Shouldn't people be conscious of these things?

&gt; You need to analyse what you're saying and separate what you believe from what people actually think and do.

What are you even talking about? It is not a matter of 'belief' that people do not need to eat meat. It is a simple fact. The human body can survive perfectly well without it, as evidence by hundreds of thousands or millions of perfectly happy, healthy vegetarians and vegans. 

Plenty of people don't care about animals - which is not something I have a problem with. If you genuinely don't care, then fine - carry on as you are - but if you *do* claim to care, then don't you owe it to *yourself* to care enough to do something about it? There are other issues with the meat / dairy industry aside from animal cruelty. Environmental damage is, for me, chief among them. Plenty of people claim to care about the environment - well, cutting out meat and dairy is a pretty simple way of actually doing something about fixing it.

If humans don't need meat (which they don't), then eating it is a choice. Omitting it is not a choice that *everyone* can make easily, but it is a choice nonetheless.

Personally, I would not go overboard with the alternating blue sapphires and diamonds. I would consider doing the engraving, or embossing, the concentric circles that are a feature of the Gallifreyan language. Have you decided whether you would do a white gold/platinum or yellow gold? I think it would be neat to do yellow gold in Concept 2. Maybe see how it would look if you did the engraving on the circles where the diamonds currently are in the concept drawing, and only use sapphires in the ring. Then see what it would like like if you did the opposite. I think this ring can turn gaudy quickly, but if done well, would be stunning and truly unique. Edit: I like your original idea, but I think it needs to be refined more. If I could draw it out myself, I would, but that might be more than what you're looking for ;) Regardless, best of luck!! 

Concept 1 is nice, but it's a lot to explain. Some people might not appreciate it as much.

Have you considered a third concept? What about two heart-shaped stones set into a band? That could obviously represent the fact that Doctor has 2 hearts, but also that you and your girlfriend's hearts are together (forever). This is much simpler but could also be expanded upon, should you and the designer decide to.

You need to get out of that habit. It's easy with A Levels to just open a paper at the first page and churn through without looking ahead. For STEP (and later university exams when you get in!), it's really important to take a few minutes at the beginning to read through the questions and decide which you like. I read each question and ranked each on a rough 3-point scale of 'how much do I like this question?'

Then when you do the paper you can attempt the 'easiest' ones first and get into the swing of things quickly. It also means that you might be subconsciously thinking about some of the other questions.

&gt; Yeah getting 4-5 good answers from pure alone on III would be an impossibility for me so I see what you're saying.

Certainly not impossible. It's hard but achievable.

&gt; I'll have a good read through the spec before deciding what to ""specialise"" in

Try not to 'specialise' too much. There will be topics that you'll prefer and might be the first you'll attempt in the exam, but ideally you want to be able to give a good stab at any of the 'easier' questions from any topic.

---

By the way, there are several resources for STEP that are useful to know about. There's always some [huge thread](http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=2807407) on The Student Room with past papers and discussion. Obviously, the [STEP website](http://www.admissionstestingservice.org/for-test-takers/step/preparing-for-step/) has resources too, like past papers and Siklos' booklets. There used to be a great forum called [Ask NRICH](http://nrich.maths.org/discus/messages/board-topics.html) which had good support for STEP but it's (temporarily?) closed now. You can still access past threads though.

null,false,neland,null,null,null,"I hope it's the case with most that they are football fans first."" I watch a lot of CL for this reason alone. It's odd. I'm not a sports person at all. And I grew up thinking that football (soccer) was a ""girl's sport"" (again, I grew up in the southeast US where the dominant team is University of North Carolina Female Team). For whatever reason, the world cup caught my attention one year and I bought FIFA (2005 ed. I think?) and fell massively in love with it; My only regret being that I didn't find it sooner. 

With that said, it's a bit hard for me to have such a true hatred for a club when I have such an appreciation for the sport as a whole. I enjoyed watching Chelsea at that time, esp Lampard (for whatever reason I always favor deep strikers and playmakers above pure finishers), so that became my team. I dislike the teams that give us such a challenge, and even more so hate teams that play very dirty or with open ego, but, truth be told, I can pretty much find a reason to pick a team for any match. Teams with American players I actively pull for because I want the sport to grow here. Same with Germans in the league (I'm half German). I pull for budding players to explode in the BPL and make it more exciting. And I will always pull for an underdog (speaking of... that Celtic Inter Europa League match! [not a spoiler, but watch it if you haven't. just a damn good match])... unless it's against us. And I don't shun players that leave (Mata, Schurrle, Lampard, Cole, etc. [all of whom I end up with their jerseys before they do so... it's like a fkn curse]).

Anyway, I feel like I have a loyalty that some may see as plastic bc I didn't grow up there or have official ties to the club, but I support our team regardless of the situation. I get angry or depressed at times that we aren't in form, but my faith in our club doesn't change. So, you could say that I do carry a prejudice against other English League Teams, yeah, but good football is good football. It's just better when it's not a team with Balotelli on it. The guy's a twat no matter how you slice it. 

Maybe other people could enlighten me as to why they dislike certain teams so much? I'm sure it's vastly different from my own reasons, but then, that's the advantage of distance I guess.

null,false,convertedtoradians,null,null,null,"&gt; And why shouldn't the child live in the same manner it's used too because it's parents split up?

Why *should* the child live in the same way if his or her parents split up? I don't see that the child has any inherent claim to that. As I said, all kinds of changes happen in the lives of lots of people for all sorts of reasons and this is just about the only one where we insist on maintaining a child's standard of living at the same level after as before.

Seems to me that the only requirement should be that the child's living standards don't drop below the line of ""acceptable living standards""-- and that should be the case for all children, whether the parents are divorced, married, single or dead.

&gt; Do we just let one parent walk away and decide it no longer wants to fund their child's life?

That depends on the money involved, surely? If both the mother and the father enough money to give the child a good life, well above the poverty line, and the child ends up living either by choice, by arrangement or by court order with the father, say, it doesn't seem reasonable to me that the mother should be liable to pay lots of ""supporting"" money when the child is adequately supported.

The goal here shouldn't be to punish or to penalise people for having children, or to judge people on their morality and decide how much he or she has to pay as penance. The goal should be to ensure the child is *adequately* supported, that the child isn't going to drop below the poverty line because Dad made off with the family silver and left Mum without a job, a house, savings or marketable skills.

&gt; How do you see what your proposing working?

Essentially, as I said earlier: There should be, in my opinion, no requirement to maintain a partner's or a child's life at the same levels that they were during the marriage. *However*, payment should flow however much it needs to in whichever direction to ensure that the child doesn't have a bad life with whichever partner he or she ends up with. Similarly, the partner doesn't have a right to be supported at the same level as during the marriage-- merely to be given an appropriate level of support to get back to work. Of course, in this case of a long marriage, this may very well involve a ""compensation"" payment in recognition of, say, the home-making undertaken in place of an external job.

&gt; how do we decide how it should live?

Someone has to decide anyway. It's going to be a flawed process with all kinds of pressures on the people making the decision.

It's an example of how you make people so frustrated by being blatantly hypocritical that they turn aggressive. It doesn't help that they have the final say as well. There's nowhere we can appeal to have it overturned before Sunday.

Going to CAS would be pretty extreme, but I think it may build up to that eventually if this keeps going. There is plenty of evidence of wrong doing against Chelsea. Others have had their bans overturned for worse cases than the Matic shove. Others have been retroactively banned for less than the Barnes challenge(s). Chelsea players have been banned for less than the Barnes challenge(s). Chelsea players have had their bans upheld for less after an appeal (Costas appeal probably lasted a full 2 hours before it was denied). It's ridiculous, and I do have a feeling that someone at Cobham is archiving all these events for future use. It would be glorious to send the FA to CAS for provably undermining Chelsea. When there are tens of millions of pounds on the line, going to court is not an exaggerated line of action.

My post was about what it feels like when you're up against a brick wall that insists it's a pillow and forces you to sleep on it (vertically). You have no choice. It's more applicable to government, but damn if the FA isn't getting close to the same level of power misuse (it's not even abuse, it's blatantly going against their own rules).

You cite the biggest landlords, think about the tax yield the government gets from them that would be lost if each property was individually let or owned instead of let by a large landlord. Who would pay the housing association? The surplus money can't be spent elsewhere as it is lost.

Housing development is indeed a mess, but this is largely the fault of short-sighted and poorly integrated planning rather than developers. As for the profits, they are related to the risk and that is always how it will be in any free society.

Last time I checked, taking the FA to the Court of Arbitration for Sport is not terrorism. 

It's not even close to terrorism or a *horrible thing*.

Terrorism - a deliberate attempt by a group or by a government regime to create a climate of extreme fear to intimidate a target social group or government or commercial organization with the aim of forcing it to change its behavior. It is generally directed at a wider target than the immediate victims and inherently involves attacks on random or symbolic targets, including civilians (Wilkinson, 2012).

Unless you're starting your reply with a wholly irrelevant comment this looks like a criticism, as if it's somehow bad by being right wing.

&gt;It's kinda right wing because some of the hosts make it like that. Not always but if you listen at say 5am you will hear horrid vitriol spouted By the host (there is a large audience at that time because London is busy 24/7).  

That looks likely it's directly implying that to hear an example of horrid right-wing vitriol you should tune in at 5am. Seriously, if that was unintended then you've just poorly written that sentence, but that's how it reads.

&gt;It was right wing because of the line of questioning, It's quite simple. They know politicians can't speak off script too far because they are representing a fluid organization. No one really asks particularly hard questions and this wasn't skill, it was lame and undermines what are actually really good ideas. 

Haha, he wan't asking her to speak off-script he was asking her to quote the manifesto.

Sorry if asking somebody about their policy is undermining their ideas.

edit: e.g. any of the ""unfairness"" parts here: http://www.landlordlawblog.co.uk/2010/05/15/tenancy-agreements-31-days-of-tips-day-15-unfair-terms-1/ - wouldn't this apply on a lapsed contract?

Bit more googling seems to suggest that when an AST expires then a statuatory periodic contract automatically begins (Housing Act 1988 S5(3)(a)). Secondly, the period of the tenancy will relate to the way that rent is paid (S5(3)(d)).

Maybe the law has changed since the info I've found, but if the OP isn't under an AST agreement (possible since they've been in the place for over 1.5 years), then they may well be able to insist that the notice agreement is the period for which rent is paid.

Did Lucas play as a lone DM for us this season before the system change? I don't think he did but I can't remember for sure. From what I remember most people were bitching about us playing him and Gerrard together rather than Lucas himself.

Personally I believe the turnaround is more down to Lovren being dropped, Gerrard having less of a role and not being used as a DM, Lucas being a lone DM, Sakho coming back, Mignolet returning to form and Sterling being played upfront instead of Lambert/Balotelli who slowed down our attack. All of that could have happened with our old 4231/433, yet some people on here really do think that Rodgers has created the next revolutionary formation, it's insane. But I've noticed lately that there's quite a few people on here who think Rodgers can do literally nothing wrong so I suppose that's not surprising.

Pensioners pensions don't hold equities, they don't get an income be 'selling', about 10 years before you retire the company begins transitioning your holdings away from equities and into safer assets like bonds, since as you are closer to retirement you have less time to recover losses. 

These pay interest/guilts which when combined with reducing the principle gradually through their retirement is what they live on. Long story short, pensioners don't give a shit about the FTSE, they are far more interested in bond markets.

Investment companies (like pension companies) make money by both value investing (buying equities or doing private equity and holding them) and trading activity (predicting and taking advantage in short term fluctuations though derivatives etc.).

Not so much fishin', unless you include collectin' frogspawn from the pools at Bosworth Country Park.

&gt; One of the places used a LOT for Hunts.

The three main hunts - Quorn, Fernie, Cottesmore - are based more on the northern and eastern sides of Leicestershire. I'm not sure there's all that much huntin' activity out that way.

&gt; Think a very upmarket country town, surrounded by ancient walls, with the only school being a private grammar school.

Market Bosworth is not walled to the best of my knowledge. And the private Dixie School is slap bang next to the High School attended by the local ~~chav yoof~~ sons of the soil. The Market Bosworth area is indeed leafy and rural but the constituency of Bosworth contains a number of shitholes too. That said, it's wealthy and small-c conservative by Leicestershire standards, but would look extremely common if it were in Surrey or Devon.

Yep - I never posted on it either (not sure I even made a TSR account!). Some people on the forums will be scarily good, though as you say not everyone taking STEP is a genius. I mainly used it for getting some guidance if I'd been stuck on a question for ages, in which case it was useful to have people better than me.

Sounds like you're already pretty well-prepared. (There are two Siklos' booklets I thnk, though good to move on to past papers if you're ready.) I think there's a sheet to keep track of which questions you've done in the 'megapack' linked to on TSR, which can be useful.

It changes the dynamics of morality somewhat.

The NHS is a great system however in recent weeks in the media the system has been questioned and if it were to be reworked then a UI would be more acceptable to many. 

The north is a failed state as it is not a contributor to the economic power house that is the UK and has not been a contributor since some time in the 50's. Hence the 11 billion block grant that Westminster have been questioning which was the reason for the Stormont agreement. A large part of the reason it has failed so miserable is because the republic has a lower tax rate which attracts  foreign investment. The tax system is based on a UK wide model which does not work in the north east of Ireland.   

Now if we had a united Ireland then the situation would be different. Investment in infrastructure across the border would bring jobs. We could also faze out the pointless doubling up of civil service jobs. We could have a single currency and a larger market.

This interpretation is wrong. Of course he did 100% of the earning, but as a married couple it is their money. Therefore you assume its 100% his money post-divorce. However, by contrast, she likely did 90% of the parenting as she was at home all day and he was at work.

In this situation it comes down to a few things.

1. Vertonghen is pushing Noble out of the way so he can quickly play the freekick that the referee has awarded his team. Totally different than Matic running up and grabbing a player from the back of the neck from behind. I do think Vertonghen is a bit rough but Noble does make a lot of it.
2. Noble was already on a yellow, which the referee didn't give here. In my book, I think both he and Vertonghen should get a yellow but it would be absolutely ridiculous to NOT book Noble here and then book Vertonghen. Noble's is a tackle from behind on a player on the ball, Vertonghen is pushing a player away from a ball he has no right to be beside. Both aren't on, but Noble's is way worse.

&gt;

&gt;The __Catalonia national football team__ is the official football team of the Spanish [autonomous community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_communities_of_Spain) of [Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia). It is organised by the [Catalan Football Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Football_Federation). The team has been referred to by various names including __Selecció Catalana__, __Selecció de Barcelona__ and the __Catalan XI__.

&gt;Catalonia is not affiliated with either [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) or [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) and is therefore not allowed to participate in either the [FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup) or the [European Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Football_Championship) because the Spanish region of Catalonia is not a state. Catalan players are full Spanish citizens who are eligible to play for [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team).

&gt;However since 1904, the team has played nearly 200 games against various national, regional and club teams.  Since 1997 they have played international friendly games more regularly. Among the teams they have played are [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria_national_football_team), [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team) and [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team). Recent friendly games include a 4–2 win over [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team) at [Camp Nou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou) in December 2009,  and a 4–0 win over [Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras_national_football_team) in December 2010. Their most recent friendly game was played in [Cornellà-El Prat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estadi_Cornell%C3%A0-El_Prat) against opponents [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria_national_football_team) in January 2013. The game finished in a 1-1 draw and concluded Dutch great [Johan Cruyff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cruyff)'s stint as coach of the Catalonia national selection.

Watched all of new who to get caught up and avoid having too much spoiled.  This also let me watch new episodes in context.  Then watched ALL episodes in order, from classic through series 8.  I would recommend skipping the recons if you are having trouble, but there are some real treasure hidden in those lost episodes.  It is really tough to get through mediocre reconstructions though. 

Rewatching New after seeing all of the classics is a real joy though.  There are so many winks and nods that don't get in the way and are barely perceptible the first time around, but are very satisfying when you get them.  I may even recommend throwing in a few 8th Doctor Audios between the movie and the new series, because the 8th Doctor is just terrific and doesn't fully get his due on screen.  Whatever you decide, enjoy, and don't try to rush too much.  It is tempting to get done as quickly as possible, but there is a strange feeling you get when you're all done.

So the fact we're getting more goals out of them using this one means we're getting them enough extra chances and/or higher quality chances (that are substantially easier to finish), which is a very good thing.  There's definitely too much on Studge's shoulders I agree, and we have no one coming in to share the burden so far.  Origi is not really a natural finisher and hasn't been at any point in his young career so far.

Lucas isn't playing as a lone DM now, nor has he at any point this season (except perhaps 1 fixture as I seem to recall a 4-3-3 with him at some point but can't remember who it was against, I may be confused), so I'm not sure what you're getting at here.

Our midfield is a seriously interesting setup right now, it's extremely fluid.

Personnel changes have absolutely helped a lot.  Lucas is still not a lone DM though, and if we were to use him as one, we'd be changing the shape again from what we were playing earlier this season.  I think this new formation will bring Lovren's form up because it hides his weaknesses and lets him be very aggressive, which is what he's good at.  I don't think Gerrard fits into it at all though, he doesn't have the legs to press as one of the forward 2 in the box, nor can he go end to end well enough to play as one of the deeper 2 in the box.  I'm curious about how we'll use him once he's fit again.

What Rodgers has done isn't revolutionary per say and he's absolutely still got his flaws. He's just playing a narrow 3-4-3 really (something Martinez did at Wigan and Conte deployed at Juve sometimes to name a few of the more prevalent ones but the smart bit of what he's done is stop trying to jam a formation and strategy down the players' throats when they clearly don't fit it and start looking at their strengths and weaknesses more, then setting the team up to minimize those weaknesses and play to the strengths.  The 4 man defensive setup didn't work last season (look at the goals conceded, it's atrocious) but we had an outrageous attacking setup to hide it's frailties by outscoring everything in sight.  If we want to play the kind of expansive football Rodgers wants us to play with a 4 man back line then we need new midfield personnel who can bring pace, power, and technical ability at the same time and they're a rare breed (Pogba, Yaya, Vidal, Matic, etc... very hard to come by players).  Henderson and Can can do it, but they're the only ones we have suited to it.  Rodgers has to adapt to the resources he has available, and that's exactly what he has done.

I agree with you that this formation isn't a long term plan.  It's for this season, before we can make some changes in the summer.  If we want to go back to a 4 man defense (be it 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1, or 4-4-2) then I really think we need a new CB, RB, at least 1 (but probably 2) midfielders, and another goal threat.  We're so close to having an incredible, complete, young, and hungry squad to work with now and it's just missing that final bit of top quality in a couple of areas.",null,0,null,1424818253,null,0,false,0,cow24x1,null,t3_2wz3r1,null,t1_cow24x1,null,t1_covzxoz,null,null,null,1427436333,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

The socialized, centrally planned, *communized* management of agriculture has been tried, repeatedly, in many countries, over decades.

In the Soviet Union the results were so bad they implemented the ""[Law of Spikelets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Spikelets)"" which saw peasants being jailed or executed for claiming the scraps leftover in their fields in order to brew a pathetic porridge to keep from starving to death after the harvest was whisked away. 200,000 were GULAG'ed and 11,000 were executed.

In China, 40 million people starved to death.

The results in Vietnam were so bad that a mere 11 years after the Fall of Saigon, the government scrapped collectivized farming (and the goal of communism, the **entire point of the war**), allowing free-market farming while retaining a token control of the actual land.

Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, Hungary, Romania, and Tanzania have all seen efforts at collectivization, and all either scrapped the plans just a few years into the cold war due to disasters, or doggedly stuck to their principles-- blaming ""the west"" for their agricultural woes.

If you have an external source of subsidy pumping in money like a fire hose then collectivization works, like on Kibbutzes or small-scale hippy farms.

If you are feeding a nation, it has been demonstrably proven to be shit.

Seemed to be a mental thing - the whole team fell to pieces again and he was just the worst offender. Once the team got collected he wasn't bad at all, but Jesus was he bad in that period when we looked shell shocked. 

And although it was my thought initially, I don't think Dinho would have made much of a difference in the first half because it was the entire team that was bad. And he's not immune from the same panic we've seen before this season from the team when things get a bit wobbly. 

All irrelevant though because Yaya will obviously play the second leg. 

Moving forwards to that game at the Nou camp we need to either play Bony loads to get him settled in or not play him in Barcelona because again today he was awkward and all over the place. Really landed Zaba in the shit for the penalty and there was that incident with Fernandinho when he tried to steal a shot and ended up kicking Dinho instead of the ball. And he almost got in the way of Aguero for the goal. I'm really looking forward to seeing him play for us, but we are trying to show-horn him in and he's clearly not ready. He took a while to settle in at Swansea and it wouldn't surprise me if he didn't really start playing like he did for the swans until near the end of the season. Not that he was _bad_,he just didn't fit, Dzeko probably should have stayed on. 

Thought Sagna looked good at LB - potentially a more defensive option than Kolarov now Clichy is suspended? Probably won't happen but it's not impossible.

That's not actually true. When you break down what he does for us that no one else does it's not world class stuff. 

He takes the ball off the back four and is comfortable in possession, and he can pass well to get the ball into Silva and Nasri quickly and is always open to receive a pass and change the point of attack. Silva gets in trouble, he passes to Yaya who takes it and passes to Nasri and the attack continues. 

That's not world class stuff. The runs through defence, the free kicks, the goals - they're all added bonuses that make Yaya world class but we don't need them. 

There are loads of (not even expensive) players who can do that job of receiving the ball and moving it forwards quickly. We need to get one, even if they are just a rotation player so we don't need to move everyone around or get Fernandinho to change playing style just to get around the fact Yaya is missing. 

Yes Pogba would be incredible and I hope we try for him, but even if we swapped him for Yaya we'd still need a backup to give us that link between defence and attack when he got injured.

I'm not sure if you're renting or buying, but you'll find prices a bit cheaper than Glasgow. If you're renting, south Belfast is probably the nicest area - south of the university, around Stranmillis, is good. There are quite a few nice areas along the Lisburn Rd, and there's lot to do, but the upper stretches, where it meets Malone, can get quite pricey. (That being said, if you can afford Malone, it's a nice area for sure). The Ormeau Rd has a couple of nice spots on it, past the bridge, but its lower reaches are pretty grim. Ravenhill is an up-and-coming area for young professionals at the moment. The Upper Newtownards Rd is a lovely area to live, but you'd probably have to buy to get somewhere good. There are a couple of nice spots off the Antrim Rd, too, but that part of town has quite a few interface points, which can be unpleasant, and the upper reaches, while nice, get very pricey again.

Of course, a lot depends on where you'll be working, and whether you're buying or not. Belfast is a bit safer than Glasgow, and dodgy areas are fairly easy to spot (lots of murals, flags etc). Outside of those, no one cares who you are or where you're from, so it's best to just find an area you like the look of, within your budget, and work from there.

I thought apart from two unfortunate, and largely unnecessary yellows, Clichy played very well today. He was making interceptions in the midfield, nice overlapping runs, and he defended decently as well. Sanga did well to take up his defensive duties and made a few nice interceptions himself, wouldn't be a bad option against Barca next time round, but I think in the League Clichy's earned a starting spot for now.

Bony had a few good passages of play on the edge of the final third, but as with Dzeko against Newcastle, he seemed to make a lot of the same runs as Aguero. That's to be expected though, he'll find his feet, and when he does he could be a monster. He's got the physicality, finishing and hold up play that Dzeko offers, but is a better passer of the ball, he's faster, and more willing to take on defenders.

I agree with your point on Dinho, especially given that he was foremost among the shellshocked Brazilians in the world cup seminfinal; both the Ferna's seem prone to discouragement, but I feel Fernandinho just offers more in every regard than Fernando, aside from perhaps aerial ability.

I'm looking at it from the perspective of a neutral football-supporter, especially now that we (Your beloved neighbours United) aren't involved in the competition. The CL has been really boring to watch in the recent years, everytime the same teams progressing, and in many occasions we see exactly the same match-ups. (perfect example: Apart from Roma joining, your group was EXACTLY the same from last year's CL-campaign, not to mention that you just now faced Barca in the Round of 16, just like you did last season. Schalke-Real happened last season as well) I was kinda hoping you guys would go through to see something different, something more unpredictable, in the past few seasons I enjoyed the Europa League more than I did enjoy the CL, just for this one reason. 

It seems unlikely now, but for the sake of UCL-football I hope you guys can kick their asses at the Camp Nou.",null,0,null,1424821177,null,0,1424821800,0,cow3up0,null,t3_2x1l5k,null,t1_cow3up0,null,t3_2x1l5k,null,null,null,1427437189,null,0,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,0,null

2) Cardiff - just cause I don't want to play Warwick in the final again

3) Warwick (they'll probably come second)

The brightness of the sky causes the pupil of the eye (excuse the rhyme) to contract and block out much of the light reaching the retina.

It's why the sky can seem 'dark' in the same half of the sky as the Sun on a cloudless day. The eye is keeping as much light as it can from getting in, and compared to the Sun and the sky immediately around it the rest of the sky is indeed relatively dark.

At an eclipse, the whole sky becomes dark other than a glaring sliver of Sun, covered mostly by the Moon. Totality is actually the most dangerous, but the safety decreases rapidly as the Moon moves over the Sun.

The sky becomes literally dark, not relatively so; the pupils dilate to let more light in. This is bad because it gives the incandescent image of the obscured Sun a chance to etch itself onto the retina.

Do not use regular sunglasses as protection - they're insufficient. Get proper eclipse glasses, or set up a pinhole projector or choose another safe method to watch.

4) Are there any holidays that you celebrate in your country that we do not in the United States?

&gt;


1. I'm British, and I was born in Bristol (south west) but I now live in Manchester. 

2. British people tend to eat a lot of food that originated in other countries! Possibly my favourite food of all is sushi, but that's Japanese. My favourite traditional British food is pie, with mash, gravy and mushy peas. 

3. You'll find that a lot of music that you hear in the USA is popular in Britain too. I tend to like quite a bit of indie music. I've no one favourite band, but my favourite radio station is Xfm 

4. Bonfire Night. It's held on 5th November, and it celebrates the fact that Guy Fawkes failed to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605, and that he was executed by being hung, drawn and quartered. We have fireworks and big bonfires, often with an effigy of Guy Fawkes on top. 

Boxing Day is the day after Christmas, and people will often visit extended family then, though there's no set of rituals in the same way that there are on xmas day. If you're in a rural area, the Boxing Day hunt (hunting foxes on horseback with packs of dogs) is traditional. 

5. You have some holidays that we don't celebrate, such as 4th July and Thanksgiving. However, most such events are celebrated in a pretty similar way.  

6. That's a really hard question to answer, because I'm inside this culture, and many things that seem normal to me may seem very odd to a foreigner! 

However, I do think that having a system that vaguely resembles secular liberalism is a major boon. There's usually (with notable exceptions) a live and let live attitude. Gay marriage, gun control and abortion are all uncontroversial topics, for instance (on that note, many people from abroad are surprised to learn that our police officers do not routinely carry guns). Atheism is considered normal, especially amongst the young, whereas I get the impression that it's sometimes stigmatised in the US. We also have healthcare that is free at the point of use and is generally excellent - no politician supports ending the NHS - to do so would be political suicide. 

7. Sport - football (soccer) and rugby are very popular, but basketball, baseball, softball and American football are pretty rare.
Pubs and clubs - the drinking age in the UK is 18
Shopping
Internet

8. You'll find the most variation amongst migrants to the UK who have come from other cultures and religions. 

However, with a 'standard' Church of England funeral, you'll notice slight changes eg that it's rare to have an open coffin. 

Baby showers aren't really a thing either. 

9. That we all have bad teeth! We really don't - our teeth are pretty good (and yes, dental care is covered by the NHS). 

People always think of ""a British accent"", when in reality there are thousands. Go a few (as in, 3-5) miles down the road and you'll often find that the local accent is markedly different. We don't all sound posh! 

10. Enjoy yourself, don't talk too loudly and don't compare everything to your home country. Oh, and make sure you leave London - it's nice, but it's not the 'real' UK - most of central London is a giant tourist trap.

He benefitted from her being at home as it allowed him to focus more on his career whilst she maintained the household and cared for their children. You argue that he should after a divorce should reap those benefits exclusively. Remember this would be impossible without her full cooperation, as for example he would have had to work less in order to be at home with their children more, or be around for anything she otherwise took care of.

Conversely, her being at home allowed her to focus on creating the ideal home for the two of them, and to do the vast majority of parenting herself.

The original farmer gets a rent on his excess land from the tenant instead of a subsidy.

edit: Don't get me wrong, some of the songs at the semi final were vile and have no place in football, but I think that due to the occassion it would be far less likely for people to tell others to stop singing it, especially with both sides indulging in it. That's several thousand, if not several ten thousand people singing certain songs, try to stop that... 

For normal games that would be a lot easier, as for example against Raith Rovers when The Billy Boys was basically shut down after the first verse or so.

What constitutes a 'tenantlike manner'? ""The tenant must take proper care of the place. He must, if he is going away for the winter, turn off the water and empty the boiler. He must clean the chimneys, when necessary, and also the windows. He must mend the electric light when it fuses. He must unstop the sink when it is blocked by his waste. In short, he must do the little jobs about the place which a reasonable tenant would do. In addition, he must, of course, not damage the house, wilfully or negligently; and he must see that his family and guests do not damage it: and if they do, he must repair it. But apart from such things, if the house falls into disrepair through fair wear and tear or lapse of time, or for any reason not caused by him, then the tenant is not liable to repair it.""

So your question revolves around how the toilet was damaged. Was the blockage from a general use that may be expected, or someone dropping their mobile in and trying to flush it (silly example I know)? Ask him for the details of his solicitors and write to them asking for confirmation of the information he has relayed to you - this might scare him into action if he was indeed lying as you suspect, he might just fix it rather than bother paying for his solicitor's time.

**Here's the full text of the article**

&gt;An eclipse of the sun next month could disrupt Europe’s power supplies because so many countries now use solar energy, electricity system operators have warned.  

&gt;“The risk of incident cannot be completely ruled out,” the European Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity said on Monday, adding the eclipse on March 20 would be “an unprecedented test for Europe’s electricity system”.  

&gt;Solar power covered just 0.1 per cent of all the electricity produced in Europe from renewable energy sources around the time of the last large solar eclipse in Europe in 1999, according to the network, known as ENTSO-E.  

&gt;But since then solar power generation has soared to at least 10.5 per cent, as countries subsidise green power to meet EU renewable energy targets.  

&gt;ENTSO-E said the eclipse could play a bigger role in places such as Germany, Europe’s largest economy, which now gets more than a quarter of its electricity from renewable generators and like other EU nations is connected with neighbouring countries’ grid systems. The organisation also said it had been planning co-ordinated “countermeasures” for several months to help protect the continent’s power system from the eclipse, which is due begin at 08:40 on March 20 and end at 12:50 Central European Time and should be visible across Europe.  

&gt;Power system operators are planning to hold special teleconferences around Europe during the eclipse and will “resort to the usual emergency procedures to protect the system if the need arises”, the group said.  

&gt;Patrick Graichen, executive director of Agora Energiewende, a Berlin renewable energy think-tank, said the March 20 eclipse was unlikely to cause any problems because there are several well-known ways of balancing power supplies and there has been plenty of time to plan.  

&gt;But the eclipse will still be a “stress test” of the flexibility of the European power system, he added, because it will have to adapt to a more abrupt shift in solar power generation than would normally occur, especially if it is a sunny day and all solar power stations were producing at full load.  

&gt;“Within 30 minutes the solar power production would decrease from 17.5 gigawatts to 6.2GW and then increase again up to 24.6GW. This means that within 30 minutes the system will have to adapt to a load change of -10GW to +15GW,” he said.

&gt;This type of shift is expected to become more common by 2030 as more renewable energy comes on stream, Mr Graichen added, “so in a way March 20 is a glimpse into the future of our power systems”.  

&gt;Solar eclipses have occurred across Europe before, but the increase in solar power across the continent’s interconnected grids since 1999 means system operators are paying more attention to this one.  

&gt;“It will have a cascading effect,” said Claire Camus, an ENTSO-E spokeswoman, explaining that countries would draw on each other’s reserves of electricity in turn as the path of the eclipse cuts solar power at much faster rates than under natural conditions such as sunset or cloudy days.  

&gt;Coal, gas and hydropower generators are likely to be used to ensure balance in the system, which has to produce as much electricity as is used at all times.  

&gt;“It’s definitely going to be a challenge for control rooms,” Ms Camus told the Financial Times.  

&gt;ENTSO-E released several papers on the impact of the eclipse on Monday, and said: “The whole of the European area is concerned either directly or indirectly.”  

&gt;About 35,000 megawatts of solar energy, equal to nearly 80 medium-sized conventional power plants, would gradually fade from Europe’s electrical system before being gradually reinjected, the network said, “all in the space of two hours while Europeans and their offices begin a normal working weekday”.  

&gt;“The reduction in solar radiation will directly affect the output of the [solar] photovoltaics and for the first time this is expected to have a relevant impact on the secure operation of the European power system,” it said.  

&gt;The network group added: “The solar eclipse is a perfect illustration that maintaining system security with more and more volatile and dispersed generation is becoming increasingly challenging.  

&gt;“What makes this year’s solar eclipse so special is the fact that there is now a non-negligible amount of energy generation units connected to the grid that are highly sensitive to variations in solar radiation.  

&gt;“This solar eclipse will thus be an unprecedented test for Europe’s electricity system, and useful to better understand the relationship between ambitious EU targets and the security of operation which all Europeans are very much depending on.”",null,0,null,1424826332,null,0,false,0,cow6r9a,null,t3_2x0ylv,null,t1_cow6r9a,null,t1_cow34km,null,null,null,1427438603,null,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

City has that fluidity from midfield to forward line, their wide players provide guile to provide passes to overlapping fullbacks.
Barca doesn't just defend with ball retention, they control space and pack it tight with players, one of the things that made Citys resurgence possible was the sloppy Barca midfield and defense and at times the lack of tracking back by their forwards.

We need to focus on controlling space and not letting their creative players get time to make passes or their fullbacks to overlap. Hit them on the counter with Sturrige and Sterling. Control what little we can with Hendo and Allen. If we play open game it will probably end 2-1 to them on account of Aguero and Silva. If we play for result we can easily get 1-0 maybe 2-0.


Let's not forget Southampton are harder to break defensively, and City are desperate, we just need to make sure we don't give them a reason to sit back, 0-0 is a good result for us and bad for them.

Some women may be ""greatly attracted"" by wealth and power but I don't think it's anywhere near as big of a factor in attraction for most women. Mr Grey being rich does play in to the fantasy, but it wouldn't work at all without him being very good looking. The same fantasy could work with him being of average wealth, but there's no way it could work with him still being a billionaire but not physically attractive. 

Popular films do impact real life but their impact/relevance is still limited. Would you agree if I said men are greatly attracted to just having a sex object and not an actual girlfriend, and we can see this in blockbuster action films geared towards men where female characters are pretty much just eye candy?

 [**Sto**](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Sto): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;
&gt;__Sto__ was a planet inhabited by a humanoid species, although other species, such as the Zocci, were represented in the planet's population. Bannakaffalatta was, for example, a resident of Sto — as were most of the passengers and crew onboard a version of the *Titanic* the Tenth Doctor once encountered.
&gt;At least one of the planet's indigenous races, at some point in the past, apparently worshiped a god named Vot.
&gt;Stovian society was rather similar to the terrestrial, including unemployment and television shows. The inhabitants of Sto had also an interest in Earth history and culture, given the popularity of the *Titanic* recreation, although some Sto residents developed a somewhat skewed view of Earth history and customs (such as Mr Copper's take on Christmas).

Our biggest problem in my eyes isnt so much chance creation but 2-way stability in the midfield when Yaya goes missing...the Ferns are not good enough, atleast together, to get the job done in both attack and defense. When Yaya is here he complements those players by going forward more and supporting silva/nasri. But when they play side by side it falls apart because they both like to hold and stay central.

What all good teams need is 2 competent nd competing players in every position, we are currently lacking a Yaya back up; a player who is going to be grittier and more of a piano lifter than the likes of our creative types (silva/nasri/navas/milner-ish) but simultaneously more forward minded than the Ferns who are bricks infront of the back line but lack forward vision to be effective beyond basic link up play and breaking down attacks.

I mean if you're going to be all fucking rules lawyer about this shit and make definitive legal statements lets actually have a look at the law you're trying to say applies right?

1) The Geneva conventions apply between sovereign states. (Apart from Article 3)

Is ISIS/ISIL/Daa'ish a sovereign state now? News to me. What about the Badr Forces Militia? Which governments military are they in? How about the Al-Hashd Al-Shaabi Militia? Which country do they represent?

2) The Geneva Conventions do not recognize any lawful status for combatants in conflicts not involving two or more nation states. A state in such a conflict is legally bound only to observe Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and may ignore all the other Articles.

So the Iraq war took how long? The invasion started in March 2003 and his government fell and then President Saddam Hussein was captured in December 2003, at all points after that it can be argued quite easily that the ONLY pertinent Article would be Article 3.

Lets now look at Afghanistan, September 21 President Bush authorises combat operations in Afghanistan, from February 2002 an interim government was put in place with the fall of the Taliban, and again at all points after that it can be argued quite easily that the ONLY pertinent Article would be Article 3.

&gt;In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions:

&gt;(1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed ' hors de combat ' by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.
To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons:

&gt;(a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;

&gt;(b) taking of hostages;

&gt;(c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;

&gt;(d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.

&gt;(2) The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.

&gt;An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict.
The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention.
The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.

That's it. 

But let us expand it somewhat shall we? Let us look at the pertinent parts of Article 4 of the Third GC.

&gt;A. Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power of the enemy:

&gt;(1) Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.

&gt;(2) Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, incuding those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions:

&gt;(a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;

&gt;(b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;

&gt;(c) that of carrying arms openly;

&gt;(d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.

How many of the personnel that were captured who were engaged in offensive combat operations not a part of the alliance/nato/un militaries would fall under that definition? How about the groups that I mentioned prior?

Here is the HUGE point that you are missing out on, the UK as part of it's doctrine and rules of engagement CHOSE to apply Article 4 of the Third Geneva convention to combatants that they engaged however this does not mean that the UK armed forces have defined the forces that they faced as of being an opposition nation state or accredited military units. Even if they did however they would have fallen afoul of the necessary requirements of being recognised as soldiers anyway, see uniforms and markings and carrying weapons openly. 

Basically what all this boils down to, please stop trying to pretend you know what you're talking about ok? It's rather irritating to see you make definitive statements when it simply isn't the case.

Also with regards to your claim that the term ""illegal enemy combatants"" is made up, well it is, by you. The actual language in use was ""Unlawful combatants"" as opposed to ""Lawful Combatants"" and is in the third geneva conventions actually, articles 3, 4 and 4. It isn't explicitly stated but...

&gt;Should any doubt arise as to whether persons, having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy, belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.

The term Unlawful combatant actually has been in use for over a century now preceding the GC's as they are under customary international law and case law. 

&gt;Customary international law consists of rules that come from ""a general practice accepted as law"" and exist independent of treaty law. 

To quote...

&gt;Whereas the terms “combatant”, “prisoner of war” and “civilian” are generally used and defined in the treaties of international humanitarian law, the terms “unlawful combatant”, “unprivileged combatant/belligerent” do not appear in them. They have, however, been frequently used at least since the beginning of the last century in legal literature, military manuals and case law. The connotations given to these terms and their consequences for the applicable protection regime are not always very clear. 
For the purposes of this article the term “unlawful/unprivileged combatant/belligerent” is understood as describing all persons taking a direct part in hostilities without being entitled to do so and who therefore cannot be classified as prisoners of war on falling into the power of the enemy.
