I really wouldn't do a degree in your position. That isn't to say that academic learning isn't useful in software/IT, but degrees are expensive in both money and time, particularly if you have to do it part-time - and you may then decide you don't like the work or the industry after all.

Get started on your own. If you're interested in software there are about a million free ways to get started programming in almost any common language - there are free online courses, tutorials, newsgroups and forums, and so on. Start coding something and learn as you go :) (The skill of learning technology on your own is an important one to have in the industry - you'll likely have to do this a number of times in a career.)

If you're more interested in system/network administration, pick up some cheap/free old computers, stick Linux on them, and start playing. Set up all the common services. Get your head around virtualisation and networking.

There are also plenty of electronics hobbyists around, though I don't know as much about this and if you want to do chip design then I suppose you may want to do a course after all :)

With some non-work experience and, hopefully, community contacts, you should hopefully be able to get into something entry-level, if you have the ability, and take it from there.

We've got a state religion that is essentially benign. It may be fusty and conservative and liable to tut at things, but it is right there, in the top seat, and therefore nothing worse is likely tobe. Britain is more likely to veer off in an American fundie direction, religion-wise, if we disestablish. As opposed to taking a more continental approach to separation of church and state. A cynical view, perhaps, but having lived here my entire life, I've met the British. 

Besides, without the divine right we don't have a functioning monarch, and we likely get President Cameron, Miliband or Farage instead. I'll keep my groomed, lifetime trained, no alarms and no surprises head of state, thanks. A tug of the forelock is a small price to pay.

I don't like the bishops in the Lords, the endless debate about the Royal Family, or any of that stuff, but while the worst we get is somewhat annoying, slightly undemocratic faff, I'll take it over many of the alternatives. We've had coming up on a thousand years of the current system and there's been a lot of blood spilt agonising over how the country should be. In 1688 we settled on more or less what we have now, and slowly but surely we've seen stable progress ever since. That's still longer than most nations have been going in their present form and I don't think we should underestimate it.

Georgetown University confirmed that she was not the same person as the blog's author after receiving threatening messages.[57][58]

null,false,frostreaver86,null,null,null,"Dear all,

The study was examining a psychological phenomenon called 'context effects' whereby changing the context of a decision causes some irrational irregularities. Specifically in this case we looked at 'the attraction effect', which has been considered a fairly robust finding until recently. The attraction effect is usually observed when you are making a choice between two equally preferably alternatives that differ on two attributes (price of a car; gas per mile for example), but when you introduce a third option (a 'decoy')( that is slightly inferior to one of the original core options, it increases the preference for that 'targeted' option.

The attraction effect has been observed in various settings, from consumer marketing to [politics](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F247352906_The_Attraction_Effect_and_Political_Choice_in_Two_Elections&amp;ei=tcErVZq0B8vtaNKpgPAB&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9jbs-O1VIru8EqJ9UmvP-u8RidQ&amp;sig2=Ie-stLVS-okgxXBFnV6cZw&amp;bvm=bv.90491159,d.ZWU). Recent research suggested that the attraction effect does not occur in real-life scenarios, such as politics ([Malkoc et al](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCgQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.olin.wustl.edu%2Ffaculty%2Fmalkoc%2FMalkoc%2C%2520Hedgcock%2520and%2520Hoeffler%2C%2520JCP%2C%25202013.pdf&amp;ei=tcErVZq0B8vtaNKpgPAB&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7hQTd5QqpDNgUZnLtzDS9whgiMA&amp;sig2=ic6MS6xqPdhw2rMUXS8tSw&amp;bvm=bv.90491159,d.ZWU)) where decisions are often amongst two or more undesirable alternatives ('the lesser of two evils). We decided to replicate Pan et al's study from 1995 on the attraction effect in politics, and Malkoc's study on if the effect only occurs in 'positive' framed decisions.

We presented the information in either a positive or negative frame, and made both 'parties' A and B the target of the decoy to ensure it any effect was not confined to any unique aspect of one option.

We didn't find any significant increase in the preferences for A or B following the introduction of the inferior ('dominated') 3rd option, at the p&lt; .05 level. 

We also noted that generally people's perceived issue importance was higher for education, which may have indicated an overall bias for any candidate higher on that attribute. We'll investigate further, but the results overall do not support our hypotheses.

In a wider sense our results have positive implications; in politics parties should not be able to increase their preference to the electorate simply by positioning themselves in a certain way; nor would the presence of parties like UKIP (seen as an inferior Conservatives to some on various issues) increase the preference share for the Conservatives by their sheer presence.

This ties into a larger series of work by recent authors on the limits and failures to observing context effects, and is an issue given its perceived ubiquity in consumer decision-making and marketing.

Prof Nutt's study focused both on harm to the individual AND harm to others.  The problem is that social harm is harder to attribute to a specific cause e.g. poorer families are statistically more likely to have more health problems (http://www.cpag.org.uk/content/impact-poverty) AND are statistically more likely to use illegal drugs (http://www.drugscope.org.uk/resources/faqs/faqpages/is-drug-use-mainly-in-deprived-areas).  And there's lots of people who voice the same concerns as Prof Nutt - it's just that he's a more prominent figure than others due to his background and his outspoken views.

I think you're perhaps confusing what he talks about and what he's been quoted.  The whole controversy surrounding Prof Nutt's dismissal from his government advisory position was based upon his argument that UK drug policy is not based upon scientific evidence but rather on selfish and short-sighted politics.

There's been a lot of talk recently about the amount of Meth users who are regular working people, especially single parents who work more than one job. They use it to keep them going through a gruelling day to day existence but if you saw them on the street, you wouldn't know they were in to meth.

And why would being addicted to heroin ruin their lives, exactly? You say it like it's a forgone conclusion. Ignoring the fact I've already pointed out that a lot of people use and you'd never know it, some people can handle an addictive habit just fine, whilst working and living a normal life.

We needed Coutinho to step up goalscoring wise this season but he hasn't.

And yes using goals as the only metric is daft, but we're talking about goals at the moment and Coutinho SHOULD be scoring more. But anyway if you're gonna use the playmaker excuse.. Sterling has actually also created a few more chances and has a few more assists than Coutinho this season..

Eriksen and Oscar have had better seasons than Coutinho so far, but Coutinho has been better in the last 4 months. But yeah Oscar isn't as important for Chelsea as Coutinho is for us.

&gt;how we had no goals in us as a team at all before Christmas without strikers 

Very poor excuse .. Oscar, Eriksen and Hazard were banging them in for fun when they didn't have a good striker. Even Lallana has scored the same amount of goals as Coutinho this season in the Prem and he has spent months out injured

Being divided for a hundred years, followed by two World Wars, followed by Communist regime tends to do that to a country's culture. 

Going by whatever brief research I could find, him being a ""Prince"" is quite seriously pushing it since the two royal lines died out five hundred years ago and all *szlachta* were historically considered equal in most regards. There's fifty-odd distinguished ""Princely Houses"" and he might be loosely related to one of them, but he's about as much of a Prince as any average member of the upper-class here is a British Prince.

And you know what, honestly I'll take Farage's 'pint and a fag' common man persona over some self-proclaimed aristocrat anytime of the day.

null,false,ironsjack,null,null,null,"&gt; First of all, the long term effects of even the less harmful illegal drugs are currently unknown. 

Quite interesting that we know how harmful and deadly the effects of smoking tobacco and alcohol are, yet we haven't done much to control that. The cannabis strain ""Skunk"" is just another product of prohibition, and is akin to drinking vodka. Skunk can cause psychosis, but you still generally need to be predisposed to it. Therefore the effects aren't a certainty, whereas I can pretty much determine that if you drink or smoke tobacco regularly enough, you will have serious physical health consequences in later life. Normal cannabis shows no sign of any harm, physically or mentally, due to the compounds within it that protect you from the negative effects. Skunk has less of these. 

&gt;   Secondly, the drug industry is already very large and corrupt.

If the whole country was legal and controlling it's own supply, then there will be little demand for import drugs. In response to the link, cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA. 

With laws like that medical marijuana law allowing growth of up to 75 plants, there will be a massive over supply of cannabis in colorado (just 5m people), which means people will definitely go to selling their own cannabis or moving it out of state. Guess what the most effective way of stopping that would be? Making it federally legal. 

&gt; My point is, there are arguments for keeping them illegal and they shouldn't be completely ignored

There are not many good arguments any more for keeping them illegal. Especially as more and more research is debunking the anti-drug ideology spread from politicians.

I think this is what I disagree with most. Absolutely we should tax people on rent gained through an inherited property or the windfall when they sell it - but right now IHT can end up forcing children who would otherwise stay in their family home to sell it as they can't afford to pay the inheritance tax. Given that most houses in london fall above the IHT threshold (median value £514,000 and not all parents are married!) this inevitably targets a lot of asset rich but cash poor families, at least in the South East.



I think whilst addressing the property crisis we need to move away from viewing property as an investment to viewing it as a home. This might mean rent controls, targeting foreign buyers and big buy-to-let landlords. But in my mind it also means readjusting inheritance tax to respect that ideal.

If all you can do to make an argument is point to what you believe someone else thinks, you are limiting how convincing your argument can be.

However it was the introduction of duelling with pistols which led to the subsequent massive rise in death from duelling which led to the end of the duelling as a widespread practice.

&gt;A review and update of a controversial 20-year-old theory of consciousness claims that consciousness derives from deeper level, finer scale activities inside brain neurons. The recent discovery of quantum vibrations in ""microtubules"" inside brain neurons corroborates this theory, according to review authors. They suggest that EEG rhythms (brain waves) also derive from deeper level microtubule vibrations, and that from a practical standpoint, treating brain microtubule vibrations could benefit a host of mental, neurological, and cognitive conditions.

Just because there is evidence that deeper thinking in the brain neurons is due to quantum vibrations in the microtubules it does not mean there is a god... I won't pretend to understand quantum mechanics but I can still see why that is not evidence.

...and taxed my money when I earned it.  When I have created businesses.  When I pay people.  That taxes my assets when I bought them or when I wish to realise their value.  The state has had money at every step of the way.  It is net positive by miles. 

&gt; Why do your beneficaries deserve the money. Why does person A deserve to inherit a house whilst person B is stuck in a dead end job priced out of the house market?

Because I have the money and I believe person A deserves it.  Because person A grew up with that house and knows the history of it.  Because person A is the person I've worked to bring up during my life to be successful and I want them to be rewarded, to relax, to feel safe.  I'm sure person B is great, but I don't know them, I didn't create them, I didn't bring them into this world.  I'd recommend they do all they can do improve their lot, and if they need government assistance then my taxes have helped them.  If I died and the state took 100% of everything I had, person B would still be stuck in a dead end job and priced out of the housing market, unless you are suggesting that the government will improve everyones jobs and the only reason the housing market is fucked is because the government hasn't got enough money?  Person B has to find a way, regardless of what I do.

It should be my decision as to where the fruits of my labour go (primarily) because otherwise there's no point in working.  If you take away that decision then I'll squirrel it away in trusts or I'll find a way to not be subjected to the law.  The state has already shown it pisses my money up against a wall in authoritative grandiose plans thought up by insipid idiots with less imagination than the goldfish I had when I was a kid.

&gt; You're encouraging old money. Old money was shit in 1800s, it's shit now.

You are encouraging the state takes every single thing I have ever worked for, when I want my children to benefit from the work I have done.

But note that United had to do that just to get to CL though. The test for LvG is now doing CL, plus domestic league and then the two cups for trophies.

For Pochettino (not that I'm a coach, eh?) but I guess that's what he's using the preseason for, because he got Levy to give him the preseason to train and game plan- I'd focus on Europe and top 4 placement, and if the domestic cups work out, they will, and if they don't they won't.

Worried that clubs will struggle to get the funding, pitch time, busses, drivers (!) to do it week in week out. Dundee struggle even getting pitch training time when football / rugby seasons are in full flow (partly cause the university division that runs sport is partly privatised and has to give X amount of pitch time a week to external parties). Busses are tough to get on a weekend, and worse so on a Wednesday.

&gt; There are a few areas in which I'm not convinced Poch knows what he's doing. He's never really had European football or a decent transfer budget. This summer is going to be really interesting.

To be fair, I think this has been a season of firsts for Pochettino though. It's the first time he's had to contend with European competition as well as domestic league cups and PL placement. In addition, he had to face a supposed locker room revolt, and hit the ground running, as well as knowing the academy set up. He's had to put in training, a new style of play, build a new culture, etc.

I think now that he's been to the academy, he sees what's going on there, he's been to matches to see players out on loan, and he knows whom he likes in terms of play style, whom he trusts. But yeah, this is the first time that he'll be in charge of transfers (he wasn't so much in charge at Southampton, and at Espanyol, he had to work with cantera lads, because Espanyol had no money to buy players). Pochettino has had a lot on his plate this year. Which one of the reasons why I thought he was crazy to have said yes to the job, but he's done a better job than I thought.

It means that there can be tighter controls over quality and dosage, making them safer for users and everyone else. Reducing the maximum amount of painkillers that can be bought at once hasn't completely stopped people from overdosing on them, but it provides a simple, effective barrier that has actually decreased overdose suicide.

If heroin can be bought legally, but only one dose at a time, in a disposable syrette/autoinjector, with a leaflet with safety advice, in a box with health warnings like 'This is the most addictive substance you can buy', and it's £20 and highly taxed, that solves so many of the problems associated with the drug. The black market trade will collapse because no-one would risk being caught with unlicensed stuff. It will be kept at a rate that is prohibitively expensive for addiction (drug dealers sometimes lower their prices or give their products away, serving as a gateway to regular use). HIV transmission amongst intravenous drug users is extremely high, and this problem would more or less evaporate. It would raise a substantial amount of money in taxes, likely paying for the cost to the NHS for the problems associated with it (alcohol does). And it could be sold in doses that were 100% pure (or appropriately diluted to a safe dose), perhaps in dosage sizes sold based on user weight - 60-70kg, 70-80kg, 80-90kg, etc. to make it have the desired effect with a drastically reduced risk of overdose. It would also keep the profits out of the hands of the gangs that manufacture these drugs and in the case of many, smuggle them into the country.

Also like in the article lot of men don't think about seeking out help from groups because of the shame of feeling weak. The whole 'man up' thing is deadly to people who are depressed. I wonder if new generations will talk more and maybe men in their 40s grew up with more pressure to 'man up' due to their culture of their childhood and parents likely fought in wars. 

Most sites giving specifically to men in domestic abuse or rape survival are in the UK, so globally online it's still needs improvement on getting men and their friend to notice signs and get help.

&gt;Ian Knott was a successful professional player for Warrington Wolves when he suffered a career-ending back injury that has left him in constant physical pain. His inability to perform many of the roles he considered part and parcel of being a player, husband and father, led him to an attempt on his own life.

If you cant afford it because interest rates have shot up that much you could sell up and revert to renting. As long as the housing market doesnt crash you will have build up some nice equity that youll get back.

Remember lenders are now supposed to do a stress test and ensure the mortgage will still be affordable to you in the event of rate increases. Therefore if the lender is happy to give you the mortgage, especially if you buy below the limit they set you, you should be fine. Or at the very least there will be alot more people in trouble before you are, e.g those with 95% mortgages taken before the more stringent lending criteria were put in place.

As IxionS3 has pointed out, if rates go through the roof so will rent so landlords can cover their mortgages, so you are similarly exposed by renting, just with renting you dont get any equity back. On the other hand if you are concerned about a housing crash putting you in negative equity then renting would also protect you from that.",null,0,null,1428938497,null,0,false,0,cqavmyi,null,t3_32cltc,null,t1_cqavmyi,null,t1_cqanxul,null,null,null,1432365221,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

In the event of divorce, women are automatically given custody of children, and men are automatically expected to pay for them to raise them. Even equal custody is very rare, let alone the man getting custody and the woman paying HIM to raise the kids! That just doesn't happen.

When was the last time you saw a man successfully file harassment against a women in the workplace? In less extreme cases the man will likely simply be flattered by the attention (as a man, when was the last time anyone complimented you... for anything?), in more extreme cases they will not be taken seriously 9 times in 10 (""citation needed"" me if you like, but there's truth to this point like it or not).

Discrimination in the workplace laws are obviously unfair. Why is it we need quota's of women on the board of companies, but not quota's of women working on building sites, or as binmen? The gender pay gap has already been proven not to exist.

2/5 domestic abuse cases are men, yet it is a WAY less publicised issue than the opposite, and men get WAY WAY less support than women do in domestic violence cases.

And to add about why men try and be ""strong and silent"" about issues... What does a women want in a man? They want a strong, reliable man who can help them with *their* issues - not the other way round! To any women who wants to argue against this, feminist or no: Imagine you come home from work and find your man crying simply because he feels inadequate. Are you honestly going to tell me you find that attractive? You might feel sorry for them or sad for them, but you do NOT find it attractive either.

There's more, too: Prison sentencing. Violent crime. Breast cancer funding vs prostate. Societal attitudes towards success and money (why is it a 30 y/o man with no job at home with mum is a total loser, but there is no such stigma for women?).

What it comes down to is that feminism is basically women taking their cake and eating it too. None of the downsides of being a man have been equalized at all, but all of the benefits have been. Men have been left with an ever harder task to fulfill, with all of the same pressures they have always had - more pressure if anything.

I want to see us grow but in a way more similar to Swansea or Southampton.  In fact I think we should aspire to the likes of Southampton, who have improved as a club in a drastic and inspiring sense.  I do not want us to grow off the back of a billionaire owner who purchases talent instead of cultivating it.

In the past 3-4 years we have operated similarly to a misfiring engine.  I feel as though Fernandes has truly appreciated the nature of his mistakes and is now building a proper framework for a fiscally responsible, well-performing football club.

As far as getting in the right people, which is the first step as Fernandes has previously stated, we are on the right track.  It was not long ago that we were presented with a writeup on the absolute farce that our training staff had devolved into after the appointment of our new owners (prior to Fernandes).  Next up is a proper training facility, one that empowers youth talent to step up and succeed.  If you refer to a recent interview with three of our prospective youth talents, they each possess a fantastic work ethic and understand the value of, ""work hard and you will be rewarded.""

The togetherness of the squad, compared to two years ago at this time, is not even comparable.  These players are fighting for their lives in the Premier League, whereas the squad of two years ago were simply collecting wages.  As much as Redknapp contributed to our fiscally precarious situation he also united the team as a brilliant man manager.  Ramsey, thankfully, has inherited a spirited squad and barring a few questionable team decisions has had a massively positive impact on our form and consistency.  The overall fitness of the team has improved under Ramsey and that is a direct result of his modern training methods.

I see improvement on the pitch, in the back office, and at the youth levels.  Through improvement will come growth but it will be the type of growth that we should embrace.

They probably omitted to mention the nice rally of to-and-fro chanting in the first half, which began with ""Terry, you're a cunt"", progressed to ""John Terry, he's won more than you"", which was then met with a double strike of ""You're mum is a thief"" and ""John, Terry, We know what you are"" (i.e. a racist) from QPR, which elicited a final, classy response of ""We know what you are, Anton Ferdinand, we know what you are"" (i.e. what Terry called him at the time) from them. Throwing stuff at the players isn't cool, but the verbals dished out to the team and their fans were all fair game in my opinion, and any Chelsea fan who thinks their travelling supporters were any better is very mistaken.

As for becoming a big club, a little bit bigger wouldn't hurt. Fulham showed that there is scope to grow quite nicely over the course of a decade or so. I still think QPR is well placed to serve a respectable slice of West London's population. I saw a Labour Party activist report back from a local meeting at Ealing Council (an administrative division of London) that two alternative sites for a new stadium have been proposed in Park Royal and Greenford. This would probably allow for more modest, realistic growth nested within suburban areas of the city from which to attract fresh supporters. I doubt at this stage that QPR will ever reach the aspirations of Fernandes and co., which is probably a good thing. I think the club should primarily be a communal expression of West London, with the added benefit of being just big enough to have loyal support from all over the place on the side. They probably need to do something to recreate the magic that attracted so many Scandinavian supporters in the '80s, for example. Chelsea, Arsenal, Man U, even Liverpool...to be honest you could have these teams play an entire season's home games abroad and [they'd probably sell out comfortably](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4l4kOhdWFc).

Stadium size also matters. Around two years ago I went to see Dortmund in their cavernous 80k ground. My overriding feeling was that it's too big. They can create a massive tifo that looks impressive, but I'm not sure it compares to a sold out allocation at Millwall pumping out ""no-one likes you, cause you're shit"". I'll also confess I came away from the home playoff leg against Wigan feeling more exhilarated than Wembley. Wembley served up an incredible wall of sound after the Zamora goal, but it didn't match the intimacy and accoustics of Loftus Road.

Exactly, so why are all these drugs where the research showing harm is either inconclusive or hasn't been carried out banned? And how exactly does your idea solve the problem when they are essentially easily available current? I have never brought cocaine in my life, if you put a gun to my head and made me get some, I could have some in 3 days, easily, probably far sooner in reality, so you haven't actually restricted me, you haven't taxed me, all you have done is make the drug more dangerous as it is now an unknown quantity at an unknown dosage. 

You can walk into fields in the UK and pick mushrooms, and suddenly you have something that is classed as an A class drug, that is growing in a field naturally, on your doorstep, that is quite frankly ludicrous. 

People do need protection from actual dangers, but when your system is actually only making it more dangerous for people, that isn't a solution, it also isn't a solution when it isn't based on any kind of logical system of actual danger. Then comes the point that because access to these drugs is so prevalent if you actually want them it is achieving nothing, other than funding criminal elements that supply them and reducing tax incomes. You aren't actually stopping people and fact are things like smoking are legal, and additive, do 100% people smoke because of that, not at all, would legalising drugs for consumption in your own home really increase usage, I rather doubt it significantly, it would just regulate the whole industry and allow people who do want to quit to get support rather than be seen as criminal social outcasts, you can't do much about an addiction if treating it is going to threaten your job security.

The problem is if people choose to take drugs on a nightout, what is the difference, they are already filling themselves full of a drug known as alcohol, one that has terrible side effects the next day and causes a massive loss of production in the work force, many illegal drugs have far lesser side effects after the fact and restriction of them just leads to the funding of criminal entities rather than tax incomes.

If you really think that firstly drugs aren't available to everyone who goes looking and secondly that a large majority of people would suddenly take drugs because they are, then there isn't really much that can be said to you, because these statements aren't true, there is a reason the rate of legal addictive substances like tobacco isn't 100% and that is because people care more about their health and money than it.

Solanke scored a nice header, but fluffed two other great chances. He generally looked sharp all game, good with his feet, created a few chances. 

Boga and Musonda (left wing and 10.) were great. Really good dribblers, and showed great vision (especially Boga who got two assists). In the second half they really started showing off, and if they develop a bit physically they're gonna be fantastic.

Issy Brown really shouldn't be playing at this level. He scored twice and was the best player on the pitch by miles. He either needs to go out on loan to a mid table club, or get worked into the first team next season off the bench a bit. He's also 6'2"". In short he looks really, really promising. 

Loftus-Cheek was a bit disappointing. He didn't have a bad game by any means, but just looked disinterested, and like he didn't want to be there. Most of his passes were just layoffs, and he didn't really try to make anything happen. There were two exceptions were he suddenly looked like he wanted to play and made some good passes and should really have had an assist. Overall he was disappointing though, If you hadn't heard about him before, you wouldn't think he was our best prospect based off this performance.

null,false,apple_kicks,null,null,null,"I admit when it comes to reporting men do come across issues and it need improvement for the support to be used as intended. 

First step was to get the law down, now we have to change social issues men face. Wish it was easy, but even womens rights was slow process to change society so hopefully its left path to help men too. 

Law is first part and its helped out some but it needs more push. usually issue men face is due to sexist outdated issues about women not being strong enough to be predatory. 

There have been some cases where men have won or won on appeal on harassment. I found some American ones. Some smaller cases may have made it through, without working in HR or employment law how am I supposed to know or how to we prove otherwise? 

&gt; [PDF](http://www.shrm.org/legalissues/employmentlawareas/documents/lreport113.pdf) While sexual harassment often is treated as a “women’s issue,” the problem of sexual
harassment against men in the workplace is on the rise. Sexual harassment charges filed by men
have doubled over the past two decades. In 2011, they accounted for 16.3 percent of all sexual
harassment charges filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)—
the largest percentage of such charges since the EEOC began reporting this data in 1992. 

&gt; For example, Austin Foam Plastics Inc. paid $600,000 in 2010
to settle a lawsuit in which a female manager allegedly made
unwelcome sexual comments toward and physical contact
with male employees. The men also alleged that the female
manager had made their acquiescence to her sexual advances
a condition for their gaining better employment terms.

&gt;Similarly, movie theater chain Regal Entertainment Group
agreed in 2009 to pay $175,000 to settle a lawsuit in which
a male employee contended that a female co-worker sexually
harassed him by repeatedly grabbing his groin. He also claimed
he was retaliated against for complaining about her actions.
And in a 2010 decision, EEOC v. Prospect Airport Services
Inc., 621 F.3d 991, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed a lower court’s dismissal of a male co-worker’s claims
that a married female employee made repeated sexual advances
toward him after he had recently lost his wife. The harasser
allegedly gave the victim sexual notes and a revealing photo
of herself, made sexually suggestive gestures and comments
toward him on a daily basis, and sent him sexual invitations and
other messages through co-workers, who later speculated he
was gay for turning down her advances and derided him for it.
When the male employee complained, his supervisors told him
he should be proud that the woman had an interest in him and
should sing, “I’m too sexy for my shirt.” This case highlights
the changing social and legal attitude toward the outdated
perception that men, on account of their gender, should
welcome unsolicited sexual attention.

&gt;Notable recent developments include a 2011 verdict from a
New Orleans jury finding Boh Brothers Construction Co. liable
for a male superintendent’s harassment of a male subordinate—
to the tune of $451,000. The supervisor was alleged to
have verbally abused, taunted, made sexual gestures at and
exposed himself to the male employee because he believed the
employee was feminine and did not fit the “rough ironworker”
stereotype. 


I cannot answer rest of your posts, I would disagree on number of points but its coming down to opinion. Like 'what women want' but women are people with lot of different tastes when it comes to dating. I think movember and work Gervais has done wonder on raising awareness on prostate cancer and other male illnesses, it seems harsh to blame womens rights on cancer awareness. When lot of issues was getting men to get tested, than not having access to tests.

&gt;Movember (a portmanteau of the Australian-English diminutive word for moustache, ""mo"",[1] and ""November"") is an annual event involving the growing of moustaches during the month of November to raise awareness of men's health issues, such as depression in men, prostate cancer and other male cancers, and associated charities.

 Yes I have supported my father when he had a break down and cried over divorce. My partner was unemployed and facing homelessness and I supported and love him even when he opened up about crying about being turned down for work. You're seeing world in a very small pov when it comes to women, widen it and you'll be surprised. 

I think government and official charities to help male domestic violence is improving, this is helping social change. We need to raise awareness that is problem I admit. 

You also seem very passionate on the issue, my advise would be to help raise awareness or donate to the charities. Here are some I know of.

&gt;More than £1 million is being provided to specialist rape support organisations across England and Wales as part of the first ever fund to help male victims of rape and sexual violence.

&gt;Approximately 75,000 men are victims of sexual assault or attempted assault a year according to data from 2012/13 while 9,000 men are victims of rape or attempted rape each year according to figures released in 2013, yet police figures show fewer than 3,000 offences of male rape or sexual assault were recorded in 2013/14.

&gt;A safe online community will also be created for men to talk about their experiences and recovery, as well as space for survivors to blog about their experiences and how they have coped. There will be a web-chat service to provide online emotional support, a text-chat service, access to phone counselling and signposting to national counselling services.

&gt;The Male Rape Support Fund is part of MOJ’s campaign to Break the Silence around male rape and sexual violence, launched earlier this year. This was supported by Channel 4’s Hollyoaks which was the first British soap to feature the issue of male rape in a storyline.

&gt;The Male Rape Support Fund was created by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to help tackle the taboo that surrounds male victims of sexual violence and encourage them to seek help. We also hope this will encourage more male victims to report the crime and bring their offender to justice. It will help increase male victims’ access to crucial information, myth busting and emotional support - either in person, or online if they find that more accessible.

Games this season when Allen hasn't played:

Liverpool in top 3 in the league for chances created, shots on target etc.

Games this season when Allen has played:

Liverpool ranked 12-15th in the league for chances created, shots on target etc..


In many of these games the rest of the team has been the same.. When Lucas was injured we played Allen and Hendo together which forced Henderson to stay back more since Allen isn't a pure DM, and in these games Hendersons stats went down by 60-70% going forward.

When Lucas was back Allen played together with Hendo infront of Lucas, meaning half our team was players that don't contribute going forward in open play (3CBs, Lucas and Allen)

In my opinion Allens only role in this team should be backup for Henderson, and they should never play at the same time. Where in the team do you see Allen for the rest of thsi season and next season? Lucas, Hendo, Allen is too defensive midfield while Hendo + Allen severely limits Hendersons play..

Thoughts?

Quite a while ago Palestinian flags went up in republican areas to welcome a visiting Palestinian figure. The instant those went up, the Israeli flags were straight up in the loyalist areas. (Tony Blair mentions this incident in the Northern Ireland bit in his autobiography)

&gt;There are some links, mind - There have been links between Republicans here and the PLO &amp; Palestinian Authority, as well as Unionists and the Zionist Movement and Israel. Peter Robinsons famous photo of him with a rifle was taken during a 'fact finding' mission to Israel.

&gt;Going into nutjob territory, There are also those (such as Nelson McCausland) that believe British Protestants are a lost tribe of Israel, and this is a promised land for them. (Being promised to them by the monarchy, who are descended from God). The flag you see where the Star of David is superimposed on the star of the Ulster Banner might be inspired by this.

&gt;Other politicans such as Sammy Wilson openly support the treatment of Palestinians by Israel, and have stated that they wish the British Government had treated Catholics the same, which may be another motivation.

&gt;More recently, the American idea that Israel must be supported in order that the next temple be built, thus bringing about the end times, seems to be taking hold a little in the more fundamentalist churches, although I don't know if thats influencing the flying of flags.

&gt;All bullshit of course. The irony is Israel was fighting against the British for its independence, some of those early figures looked to the Irish for inspiration (Yitzhak Shamir gave himself a nickname based on Michael Collins). And the histories of the places post creation have been extremely different. Northern Ireland wasn't surrounded by hostile and aggressive states trying to wipe it out by force for most of it's existence, for a start. But history won't get in the way of the locals here, methinks....

Mortgage over payments and my monthly savings combined are currently around 48% of my take home pay. So goal number two is to find a way to squeeze the remaining outgoings for any extra savings to see if I can bump it to over 50% for the year. Cash back and switching utilities helps!

Third one is to make my savings work harder for me. I've nearly reached my emergency fund goal of six months expenses and these will be very shortly scuttled over to my shiny new 123 account, along with the direct debits.

People aren't educated well enough on drugs at all. I didn't know anything about MDMA from school, I should really have been taught that there was a comedown and that you can experience seratonin syndrome if you aren't careful.

If drug education focused on minimising risk instead of trying to scare everyone then it would be way more effective. Take the current anti-drug advert on YouTube. I fucking hate it, it has a guy driving around on drugs seeing flashing lights and freaking out thinking it's the police, and then at the end it turns out it is a police car and he gets caught and it says ""Now you have even more reason to be paranoid"".

 [**Fourth Anglo-Dutch War**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth%20Anglo-Dutch%20War): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Fourth Anglo-Dutch War__ (1780–1784) was a conflict between the [Kingdom of Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain) and the [Dutch Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic). The war, tangentially related to the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War), broke out over British and Dutch disagreements on the legality and conduct of Dutch trade with Britain's enemies in that war.

&gt;Although the Dutch Republic did not enter into a formal alliance with the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) and their allies, U.S. ambassador (and future [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States)) [John Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams) managed to establish diplomatic relations with the Dutch Republic, making it the second European country to diplomatically recognize the [Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress) in April 1782. In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce was concluded as well.

&gt;Most of the war consisted of a series of largely successful British operations against Dutch colonial economic interests, although British and Dutch naval forces also [met once off the Dutch coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dogger_Bank_(1781\)). The war ended disastrously for the Dutch and exposed the weakness of the political and economic foundations of the Republic.

Because it was waterproof, everyone referred to it as “duck” tape (like water off a duck’s back). Military personnel discovered that the tape was good for lots more than keeping out water. They used it for Jeep repair, fixing stuff on their guns, strapping equipment to their clothing... the list is endless.

After the War, the housing industry was booming and someone discovered that the tape was great for joining the heating and air conditioning duct work.

Labour campaigned on the ""Yes to AV"" side of the referendum (not exactly with great gusto, but still). I know that AV is only a poor man's voting reform, but you can thank the Lib Dems / Tories for that one; we could only campaign on the referendum we were given. And yes Blair was a weasel about it back in 1997, but all I can recommend on that front is ""don't vote for Tony Blair this time"". Writing off the whole party forever for Blair's nonsense (on any point) is silly; you've got to judge the people that are actually on offer this time around, and Miliband is in no world a Blairite (however much Labour's rivals on the left wish he was).

From today's manifesto (although it was announced months ago):

&gt;We will legislate 
so that a public sector operator is allowed to take on lines and challenge the 
private train operating companies on a level playing field.  

That's nationalisation, you know. Or it's ""nationalisation wherever it makes economic sense to do so""- which seems grand to me.

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"&gt; I guess I never really belived that regulated drugs would in any way reduce crime, but would end up increasing concumption.

Well inherently that has to be untrue as if supplying and carrying and consumption of the drug is a crime then that will no longer be a crime, so crime has dropped. 

But to move away from the technicalities of the point and to the crux of your meaning, if drugs are no longer an illegal black market this takes money out of that system, this means it is less lucrative to be in that system, I am sure we all know the guy from school who made quite a bit of money selling weed, now if he couldn't make that money, maybe he goes and gets a job (conversely maybe he goes and does some other criminal activity, but that hasn't actually increased crime). But not only do you take money away from criminal enterprises you also gain in tax revenues, tax which can be used for anything, including treatment programs for problem users who are currently stigmatised by society, either through usage of the drugs, or will become stigmatised for seeking treatment of a hidden drug problem.

&gt; Ask people if they'd buy drugs legally if they could, and they'll say yes.

Go offer someone a needle of heron, for free, and see how many say yes, because I and most other people are going to tell you to get away from them. Your premise is based on the idea that drugs aren't already available if you want them, if you are truly telling me that you don't know anyone who most likely knows a way to get get some cocaine you should probably go outside more. Most people have access to it, just like most people have access to a lot of things they consume or take part in, the fact that while largely available to all their is still a stigma about taking many drugs really goes to prove this.

&gt;  legal regulated drug manufacture is never going to be as cheap as kids brought over from eastern europe to work in a sweatshop that steals its power from the grid

This is just plaining untrue, mass production due to economies of scale, proper business methods and all the other economic reason will mean that they will be way cheaper to produce in a way purer and regulated form. Tesco sells paracetamol pills at 60p for 24, with all the regulation, purity testing, sterile packaging, taxation, legal requirements, distribution, and profit in place, if you really think the same manufaturing infrastructure can't produce MDMA at £1 a pill pre-tax (and far less realistically) you really have no idea of the pharmaceutical market. There is a reason LSD isn't available and that isn't because of cost, it is because of infrastructure and the skillset required to make it, you need a semi-professional lab with highly trained chemists, the fact that any drug is available without needing this, means it is cheap and easy to produce, because the ones that aren't are not available. The majority of modern day drug costs come in research and development and human testing, there is 0 research and development needed for current widely available and easily producible illegal drugs and human testing, well we know they can't be that bad at least over the short term because people aren't all dying, but long term effects are concerns, concerns that due to the illegal market consumers currently aren't informed about unlike in the case of smoking and alcohol.",null,0,null,1428942810,null,0,false,0,cqayb1e,null,t3_32fc98,null,t1_cqayb1e,null,t1_cqar6bj,null,null,null,1432366548,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Obviously when people first join this chamber, many are not going to be experts in politics, but I'd expect most of them would learn the ropes fairly quickly. New members could be chosen on a rolling basis, to stop an abrupt loss of knowledge if the entire chamber is re-chosen in a single event. 

I'd suggest that whilst working in the legislature these people would be given a salary and access to accommodation (similar to current MPs).

Whilst there may be some disadvantages to the new system (e.g. a proportion of ordinary people are likely to be corrupt, some will slack on the job (as with any other workplace)), it also offers clear advantages compared to current electoral systems (e.g. members wouldn't be diverted by party issues, or by trying to be re-elected).

Got a **referal to a dermatologist** which is awesome. Should be within the next couple of months! 

Been favouring the **Chocomania body butter from The Body Shop** (over the lemon one) smells amazing and my skin is happy.  No angry spots on my back as yet so that's good. 

Not so much skin, but I got a sample of **unrefined shea butter** to test out and mixed it with some **TBS Chocomania Beautifying oil** so I could run t through my hair. Curl definition is at 11. I'm well haps!  This is defo a good alternative to **DAX** for me.

It really can be, it is just that overnight is the ramping up of production infrastructure and information campaigns over several years while it is all put in place. Or maybe more preferably you have to undertake a confidential medical before having access, this will stop a large number of ""on the fence"" users, creating a barrier to entry, that is really just an artificial barrier, it is access to all, but it is proactive access. This would also mean their GP could check that they aren't going to kill them due to some unknown medical condition and also inform them about the risks of their action and what not to do while taking them. 

&gt; Secondly, how do you source a safe, stable, and ethical supply of these substances

That isn't a relevant question, any pharmaceutical product will be made by regulated companies in the UK, there is enough money that investors would plough their money in in a heart beat. Well that is assuming regulation is set in stone to limit risk of it all being shut down in 2 years time. In fact you can create a ring fence market to maximise the economic advantage for the UK, this won't make a truly free market, but who are you really competing with? No one has this stance.

Then for ethical supply, go talk to any south American government and say ""We will give you X million, for X amount of Coca"" and see how quickly a government farm springs up to supply this need, money speaks, the government doesn't get tax revenue from criminals, it does if the UK (or UK private company) is paying their governement.",null,0,null,1428944313,null,0,false,0,cqaz97b,null,t3_32fc98,null,t1_cqaz97b,null,t1_cqapgqh,null,null,null,1432366996,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I asked if you find it (sexually) *attractive* that your partner opened up to you emotionally like that. The wording of your sentence suggests you love him *in spite* of him admitting he cried when he had been turned down for work. Did him opening up to you like this enhance your view of him as your sexual mate, diminish it, or leave it unchanged?

Also, the fact that he didn't even cry in front of you (only admitting that he had cried) speaks volumes. Clearly this man is not particularly emotional!

Criminal gangs won't cease to do things society deems criminal simply because we decriminalise current crimes. 

The reason it can't simply be transferred to some sort of pharmacy system is because of the risk of crippling liability (tort, i.e. negligence; the infamous floodgates argument) that this would expose suppliers to. As with most things that are harmful to the extent they are closely associated with death, it would be silly to allow any private company or government institution to countenance their supplier. 

Unless of course it were very, *very* closely regulated -- in which case it would become quite expensive not just to buy, but to regulate its sale.  And now Act 2 [enter criminal gangs].

That said the drug war has been a failure, and we should definitely move towards a more rehabilitation-oriented criminal justice system, at least in drug related cases.

This is precisely why I don't display the party stances after taking the quiz (you can still look at the sheet if you're curious though), as the quiz is supposed to not just base the stance on one issue, but a combination of issues, which combined will hopefully provide something much closer to the ""true value"".

I agree RLC and Boga are probably the most first team ready and Solanke isnt far off either. 

RLC is incredibly composed on the ball and his size helps keep others off the ball. But in defense he is more timid than you would expect someone of his size to be. He doesnt seem to be to eager to challenge for the ball, but is is something that can definitely be worked on. Otherwise I think he could be a first team player for us or on loan next season.

Boga looks incredible. Speed and strength on the ball and good vision. He should definitely be playing first team football somewhere next season. I would honestly like him or Traore as a 5th option for the attacking mids next season. 

Solanke and Brown look like they need more of a challenge next season to keep progressing.

Colkett looks very good as well. Works hard, recycles possession very efficiently seems promising.

Musonda has amazing ability. If he puts on some mass he could be an extraordinary player.

Why do you liberals feel that you must attack people's characters rather than their stance? Is it due to the cognitive dissonance you have when confronted with statistical fact, or are you just that dim?

Again, why do you assume anyone with an opinion that differs from yours' is less intelligent than you? I'm no genius but I somehow, despite my apparent backwards views, managed to earn my Bachelors in Computer Information Systems (BC CIS) and I now work as a sys admin for a multinational fruit conglomerate. Jus becuz I'm a-Merican don't mean I'm dum.

Despite what prejudicial notions you have about me based on my user name, I can assure that I have done more to help poor minorities than you. For 7 years before I joined up with my current employer I ran a successful free-lance IT consulting shop. All during that time I did a ton computer work *pro bono* for poor blacks, mexicans, and whites. I've been in homes where none of the adults spoke English and had to communicate with them via their children. I've been to the local ghetto many times to fix up kid's computer because they keep downloading viruses thinking they are the latest mixtape from whatever degenerate rapper was hot at the time. You think I don't know life is fucking hard for these people? You think I don't know that they just want a better life for their children, just like I want for mine? I've given them laptops, desktops, and countless hours of my time because, unlike you, I am not a heartless individual.

My venom comes from people like you, who are truly prejudiced. It's people like you who tell me I must respect immigrants who do not respect me. It's people like you who tell people like me I am filled with hate, when I am not. How does love for one's name, culture, identity, and nation translate into hate for others? If fighting to preserve my heritage means I'm a hateful bigoted person, then so be it. I will not, and do not, let bigoted, prejudicial individuals like yourself define me.

What's worse? When I say nigger or paki, or [when ISIS publicly executes a homosexual?](http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2015/03/10/watch-leading-islamic-scholars-justify-executing-stoning-and-shooting-gays/)

Well we were not in the same room when it happened, I was at work and he was at home I expressed wish I was with him so he wasn't alone at that time but we still talked. I didn't add those details because I didn't expect to be grilled on details so over analysing was a risk.

Couple can open up and trust each other emotionally, sometimes relationships have rough patches. Not all relationships are about fitting in set roles, it can be adapting to change. If he cried all the time I would remember my previous experiences with break downs/depression and ask how he feels, listen, help him get support, a hug if it was wanted. why wouldn't I do that? Only reason I feel I'd leave is his condition became dangerous to be around or there no chance for change to cope and get better.

I can see why lot of relationships break up with mental health issues and that isn't always done to sex life (I'm not going to say 100% I'd be fine or that its bad if you leave). It can be pressure that has on a relationship emotionally, but that affects people no matter the gender. Guy can break up with girl with depression as much as a woman might break up with a guy.

1. This is toxic waste, some one prepared to dump near your dumpster could be riddled with diseases - Hep B/C are not uncommon and relativly infectous.  HIV is another (small risk)

2.  Your protection is most important, make sure you wear disposable gloves.

3. If its easy to handle and quite firm then moving it into a waste bag (preferably a marked biohazard one) is straight forward.  If its more fluid then you could use something to clump it together.  Biohazard clean up kits all contain these.

4. Area sterilisation, after the mess has gone it will need to be neutralised.  Bleach will work for this.

It doesn't there is no set date, it is all politics, however ideally you would want to reduce your debt load to a sustainable level as fast as possible.  

[""The problem is that another recession will strike one day. Going in to a new recession with debt still high – and it’s higher now than at any time since the late 1960s could leave less room for manoeuvre. The sort of additional borrowing that we were able to support as we made our way through the recent period might not be as easily financed.""](http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7525)

&gt;To my understanding while rates are low taking on new debt isn't the disaster it's made out to be.

Your quite right, debt has never been so cheap, arguably down to the great savings glut we have globally. Debt isn't necessarily bad, however debt that you cannot repay is very bad. 

&gt;To my understanding all the major politicians have signed up to reducing the deficit, they just disagree about how long it should take or how we should go about doing it.

Correct, the big worry IMO is a weak government, one that will make unfunded pledges to get elected.[Osborne struggles to explain how £8bn NHS pledge would be funded](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/apr/12/the-conservatives-pledge-to-cut-inheritance-tax-on-family-homes). They are all guilty of it and this is not going to be a short term problem, it is going to effect at least the next 3-5 governments.

&gt;What are the benefits / negatives to these policies, why should we choose one over the other? Perhaps this has already been explained somewhere but I haven't read it.

Paisley didn't make a distinction between being Irish and British, at least in the sense of a Northern Irish 'Brit'. It's the same as a Scot, Welshie or cun... English person also being British. They can overlap.

It has fallen out of favour amongst Unionists due to the perception of Irish = Republican/Catholic and is amplified by the Ulster-Scots movement which is attempting to replace Irishness with a regional culture.

Truth is we can be British, Irish and Ulster-Scot if we like to. They don't have to compete against each other. I'd like it if more Unionist politicians and high profile Orange leaders came out in favour of 'retaking' what is essentially our birthright. It's not like the shinners are going to object.

This is what Balls was saying when he said:
&gt;“Yes, there will be cuts outside non-protected areas across all these budgets which will apply in England and in Scotland,”

However he went on to explain:
&gt;Whether or not the overall Scottish budget is cut depends upon whether or not that [money from tax changes], which is financed and extra, is more than or less than our unplanned cuts – and that will depend upon the scale of the unplanned cuts.”

So if all goes according to plan, there will be no cut. Which is roughly in line with what Murphy said, although he was working with IFS figures which are not necessarily representative of the numbers that Labour HQ are working with. Not to say either is right or wrong, just that they are not necessarily going to marry up exactly.

The only controversy is around that point. The IFS claims that Balls can meet his fiscal targets with cash to spare, equalling billions of pounds. Although Balls isn't making that claim himself because he is being markedly more cautious in predicting what the economy is going to do, I'm sure he'll be thrilled if it turns out that way.",null,0,null,1428948527,null,0,false,0,cqb1rfx,null,t3_32ft6g,null,t1_cqb1rfx,null,t3_32ft6g,null,null,null,1432368176,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

There'll be a reason that he can't nail down a permanent place in the Spurs squad right now, and I can't imagine they'd want to sell him to us too cheaply as we were (until recently) fighting for Europe against them.

I'm also hoping it doesn't become a president that we buy the unwanted players of other premier league clubs. Martinez hasn't been too narrow sighted with his choice of transfers so far but we'll never find the next Coleman by buying off Spurs.

He seems like a safe bet right now but I worry that signing him would be nearly as much of a gamble as signing someone who's new to us. If he played with the same intensity and positive attitude next season I'd be very happy but only time will tell.

No, you don't sound judgemental - I imagine that's an extremely common perspective. But it's from a perspective that doesn't have all the data.

[Suicide ideation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation) or intrusive thoughts are a lot more common than many people realise. And they are reliant on self-reporting. The only way you can know if someone experiences them is if they tell you - it becomes a standard reflex to hide it.

Banning people with these conditions doesn't stop them from doing the jobs - it just means that they will hide their conditions and avoid seeking professional help for them so that it is not on their medical records (edit: And by avoiding treatment, usually makes their condition *worse*). In fact it looks like this is what happened with the Germanwings flight:

&gt; ""The fact there are sick notes saying he was unable to work, among other things, that were found torn up, which were recent and even from the day of the crime, support the assumption based on the preliminary examination that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and his professional colleagues""

Honestly, the easiest way to prevent this in the short term would be first and foremost to ensure that there is *never* just one person in the cockpit - this is SOP for many airlines already. But it will need a big change in peoples' perceptions to really solve this and stop the feeling that it's a condition that must be hidden away.

i think next year will be quite the year for us. if we can hold onto pretty much everyone (and if we sell raheem, replace him with someone like a depay or walcott). this year i saw some really promising stuff. we played like shit literally the entire first half of the season and we made two semi finals in domestic comps, we went on a 13 game unbeaten run in the prem, and have lost i think 3 games in our last 22-23 matches? had we continued this form into the first half of the season, we might be looking at a round of 16 maybe round of 8 battle in champs league and 2nd place in prem. 

i saw a squad that had to dig deep and find something when all the chips were down, a manager who risked his entire career by changing to a 3-4-2-1, and fans who are being tried harder than they have in a long time. after last year, anything but winning the league was going to be a disappointment, and i'm disappointed we crashed out of cl so quickly...but im willing to give BR more time and this squad more time and our owners more time on this project. they are taking all of the right steps forward, we have increased sponsorship revenues by almost double, we have tv deals doubling after next season and at the ned of next year, we'll make an additional 30-35m off the added seats. i am so super positive right now because we are lightyears ahead of saints and spurs in terms of developing the club (stadium being the big one, but sponsorships we have a serious team going out and geting those deals done, and our fan base globally is probaby bigger than both of those teams combined)...be positive because at the end of the day, we are liverpool. if fsg, br and this regime doesn't work out, there is no shortage of suitors who would come in and try their hand at making liverpool great again...never forget, ""at the end of the storm there is a golden sky""",null,0,null,1428949286,null,0,false,0,cqb28no,null,t3_32fq9e,null,t1_cqb28no,null,t1_cqaxo97,null,null,null,1432368403,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

Essentially there is a split within mennonites between whether or not they are simply a denomination of Christianity, or whether they are both a denomination and an ethnicity. A distinct group of Europeans during the Holy Roman Empire formed their own denomination and have formed a strong (yet relatively small) culture which continues today. In Canada specifically (especially in the Prairie provinces) during the late 19th and early 20th century, vast swathes of cheap farm land offered mennonites the opportunity to emigrate on mass from Europe and form strong mennonite communities, free from the control of the Prussians that had given them so much trouble over the last few hundred years. Here in Saskatchewan, Swift Current is probably the biggest and best example of a mennonite settlement.

Different people give in different ways and respond to different calls to action. I entirely understand charitable fatigue, especially when there are so many causes and people have limited funds. 

&gt; This is the result when you pay big business/sales people to run charities.

I've seen both sides, charities led by grassroots with little knowledge of the sector and people who have transferred over from the business world. Both have their flaws and people complain about both. If you're not professional then people complain about efficiency whereas if you embrace a culture of aggressive fundraising more akin to business people complain about charities losing their soul. 

&gt; It's the result of a corporate'esque strategy that doesn't see people but revenue margins.

Equally, people rightfully expect that charities are effective with their spending, are accountable, transparent, well governed, make an excellent impact with the funds they raise.

* Media portrayals of Northern Ireland tend to focus on a few staunchly nationalist or unionist low-income areas. Are middle class areas, particularly of Belfast, more mixed?

Yes. There are few middle class areas that aren't mixed in the greater Belfast area.


*     What's so great about the Nolan show?

It's not really that good. Fat man annoys people about politics? I guess it's somewhere in between Jerry Springer and Fox News opinion pieces.

*    Was there any unionist response to the changes to the Irish constitution that culminated in the declaration of a republic in 1948?

 The main thing was that they called a snap election to try and maximise their support, thinking it would give them more seats in the NI Parliament. Most of 48 and 49 were spent overseeing the implementation of the NHS.

* Is there a religious aspect to the Loyalist love for Israel, in the US many of our right-wing Christians love Israel for religious reasons, is there such a sentiment among hard-core loyalists in NI?

This is quite interesting, as this is something I'm actively researching at the moment. The short answer is not really. In the US, the religious grounds for support of Israel are rooted in dispensational millennial theology. Essentially, this holds that several parts of end times prophecy from Revelations have yet to be fulfilled, and thus must be fulfilled before Christ's return and the millennium. As the return of the Jews to Israel is one such promise (from Daniel), millennials tend to support Israel as they believe it will hasten the millennium. (If you're interested in this, Ernest Sandeen, George Marsden, and more recently, Matthew Avery Sutton, have explored this in depth).

In Northern Ireland, while some Protestant preachers are very interested in such issues, the Israel flags in loyalist areas are not an expression of theological concern.


* Do Sinn Fein members tend to deny Adams' IRA or just shrug it off/not care?

I've had some SF youth members categorically deny it to me. Mostly, the oft-repeated argument is that he never admitted it, and there's no proof. In the real world, pretty much everyone and their granny is more or less certain he was in the RA. 

* Ian Paisley said that part of being an Ulsterman was by nature being an Irishman, does this sentiment survive within loyalism or has the idea of Ireland as a foreign country destroyed the link to the loyalism that existed while Ireland was part of the UK?

Loyalism, of the flag waving, sash wearing variety, makes no coherent logical sense, and any attempt to understand it in the terms you're describing is doomed to failure.

Within unionism, there are a wide spectrum of views on identity, and you'd have to ask individual people how they felt on the matter.

&gt;

&gt;I'm glad to see it, though I'd actually like to have seen a little more influence from thinkers like Cruddas. The future of socialism is not found in the increasing centralisation of power in the hands of an increasingly corrupt and unaccountable state, nor in allowing the market free-reign over our lives and communities. Real socialism must be about putting power into the hands of ordinary people: Giving communities power over the decisions that matter to them, against the power of both the state *and* market. On *some* things like railways, nationalisation might be the answer (as they seem to be a natural monopoly), but on others, we (the left) really need to ask ourselves if the answer is really to just nationalise, nationalise, nationalise. This supposed dichotomy between 'state' and 'free-market' is a false one.

&gt;A key thing missing from this manifesto for me was that nowhere that I could see did it talk about co-operatives and mutuals. Workers should own and have an influence and stake in the businesses in which they work, that should be the bar set for any party claiming to be a Social Democratic one. Labour should be doing far more to encourage citizens to create their own small co-operative businesses.

Are christians not represented as to their frequency in society? You're still not getting it, are you.

If christians should have unelected representation in parliament, why can't any other group? This is the point you're consistently failing to grasp, or at least failing to address because you know you're arguing a flawed argument.

&gt;I think our government should be a cross section of all society.

I think it should be elected. There is nothing stopping anyone trying to become a member of parliament by getting their name on the ballot and asking people to vote for them.

Because only christian bishops get a free pass in to government.

That's not all that makes them a person but their view may be representative of other people who have those views in wider society.

If people vote for them. 

The point is these bishops are UNELECTED and afforded a free pass in to government that no other group is afforded.

null,false,nine8nine,cnty-england,England,null,"Ok so I get he is tweeting those and can't provide examples or further discussion, but let's start with point 1

*1. We’ve lived through an era of appalling growth in income and asset inequality. Locking that in for a 2nd generation is very bad news.*

An example would be nice. This generation is uniquely being stiffed by a boomer generation that had good pensions, good working conditions, good salaries, looting the public purse to do so. Paying inheritance tax takes money away from the generation that is capital and asset poor, and puts it into the pension pots of those older people.

*2. Growth in house value is generously excluded from capital gains because you need to live in it. When you’re dead, that excuse is gone.*

Yeah unless your children want to live there. What if it is genuinely their only hope of ever owning a home. Plenty of people, according to a recent thread, have given up on even that basic dream. So let's make sure they get another kick in the teeth to follow their parents decease.

*3. Housing wealth derives from the value of the land, which rises because of the actions of everyone in the country, not you.*

All wealth derives from the value of the actions of everone. This is a nothing statement.

*4. Caring for the old is very costly. The old didn’t foresee this, and didn’t pay tax to fund it. Housing wealth will do nicely.*

And again, the boomers do a number on generation Y X and Z. Doesn't the future of the country count for anything?

*5. A country where you get ahead best by luck and inheritance, rather than hard work, is a lazy unfair country that will fail.*

Nobody is ""getting ahead"", or if they are doing so, it is not by much. Raising the threshold will at best make a middle class person who is asset-poor asset rich. If they sell the asset they might graduate to being a middle class person with the savings to invest. We are not talking about big bucks here, £1 million compared to what the super rich are getting away with is a fraction of a percentage of a drop in the ocean. Here's a thought - why don't the working class and the middle class team up and stop sniping at each other over peanuts, maybe we can have some of that real change.

*6. I totally get the primordial desire to do your best for your kids, but if your plan is to do that with banknotes, you’re doing it wrong.*

Actually I think doing your best for your kids is a value I want our society to promote. Milton Friedman once said the most economically irrational thing he'd ever come across was the way parents put their children before themselves. It doesn't make sense but we know it's a moral impulse, and those should be something we encourage, from sticking £50 in an ISA every month to yes, inheriting a half million pound house. Even if the feckless offspring go and waste it all, that's money for the economy, not the plodding taxman.

&amp; Edited for formatting - also don't take the plodding taxman thing too seriously I just don't believe HMRC does anything without massive waste and inefficiency.

&gt; Labour believes in the historic union of our nations working together for the
common good. But as devolution has continued to gather pace, our union
now needs to evolve. As a priority, we will set up a people-led Constitutional
Convention to directly address this and to drive political reform of Westminster. 

&gt; Labour is committed to replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate
of the Nations and Regions, to represent every part of the United Kingdom,
and to improve the democratic legitimacy of the second chamber. It is also
time to consider how English MPs can have a greater role in the scrutiny of
legislation that only affects England. This includes the option put forward by Sir
William McKay, of a committee stage made up of English-only MPs. These ideas
must now be considered as part of the Constitutional Convention process

Did Labour just cut their own throats?

I can imagine that this policy appeals more to young and progressive voters. The majority of voters aren't young people. They would need a lot of young people to register, and turn up to vote, on these sort of radical changes to the United Kingdom.

Better to bring in these sorts of changes at a later stage.

Because keeping prices high means its impossible for rather more people to live in their own home. There is also the issue of location. Generaly its best if people of working age are able to live in areas where there is a demand for labour. If this means providing insentives for OAPs to move to hull then so be it. Soddding great chunks of cash is a reasonable insentive.

&gt; If you want property prices to fall (and I certainly do), then all you have to do is relax planning regulation. It's as easy as that.

The size of land banks that some developers are sitting on suggest that that is unlikely. Even if we look at peak private sector building rate it isn't high enough to keep prices under control. Goverment run building could do it in theory but planning regulations are less of an issue there.

Easier access for people with addictive personalities (or mental health issues) is not a good thing, not everyone has self control no matter how much 'education' they receive. With legalisation more vulnerable people are liable to suffer as a result if access is easier (I don't care how easy access is now, making it easier would not help). I have a somewhat addictive personality and I'm glad I didn't make some bad decisions in years gone by, not everyone will be so lucky, and some people close to me have not been.

Having lived with somebody with a drug induced psychosis (and yes it was drug induced, absolutely no doubt) I would not wish that experience on any other family and I would not condone steps to make it more likely to happen. Maruajana I personally don't care about anymore, LSD I would fight tooth and nail to never be legalised for recreational use.

One point you mention - ""economic growth from a new industry and subsequent taxation"" I find it morally repugnant to make money like that over the crushed lives of individuals and families. Yes I know alcohol, cigarettes, heck even cars etc but they are too ingrained in our society to do anything about easily, maybe recreational drugs are too however I still find it morally wrong to push for more avenues to do this.

On the whole my personal experiences have been nothing but negative, I'm guessing not so much for the rest of you.....

&gt; The United Kingdom

&gt; Labour believes in the historic union of our nations working together for the
common good. But as devolution has continued to gather pace, our union
now needs to evolve. As a priority, we will set up a people-led Constitutional
Convention to directly address this and to drive political reform of Westminster. 

&gt; Labour is committed to replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate
of the Nations and Regions, to represent every part of the United Kingdom,
and to improve the democratic legitimacy of the second chamber. It is also
time to consider how English MPs can have a greater role in the scrutiny of
legislation that only affects England. This includes the option put forward by Sir
William McKay, of a committee stage made up of English-only MPs. These ideas
must now be considered as part of the Constitutional Convention process

Summary:

Labour will:

* set up a people-led Constitutional Convention to determine the future of
UK’s governance

* replace the House of Lords with a Senate of the Nations and Regions

* pass an English Devolution Act, handing £30 billion of resources and powers
to our great English city and county regions

* give new powers for communities to shape their high streets, including
power over payday lenders and the number of fixed-odds betting terminals

* meet our promises to devolve further powers to Scotland and Wales

* give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote

* create a statutory register of lobbyists

* ban MPs from holding paid directorships and consultancies

* require large companies to publish their gender pay gap

* implement the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry.",null,0,null,1428951383,null,0,false,0,cqb3lms,null,t3_32fh5n,null,t1_cqb3lms,null,t1_cqap4qa,null,null,null,1432369043,null,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13,null

First, it will grant them more power as they will have a more direct mandate from the people. As it stands, the House of Lords has very little power in legal terms compared to the Commons. In colloquial terms this is apparent from the fact that when people say Parliament, they typically mean the Commons. 

Secondly, it will inflate the role of the independent (and unelected) Judiciary. [Contrary to popular belief, the judiciary have a big role in 'making' law.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) It's not the same law creating as typically associated with the legislature/sovereign, but it is highly important to shaping it. 

As soon as you make a body elected, it 100% loses whatever shred of independence it previously might have had. At the end of the day, there has to be some degree of independence within the democratic process, so if you opt for an elected second chamber, you will certainly grant the unelected judiciary with more of a role in scrutinizing Acts of Parliament to sort of balance this out.

edit:Once again, I do apologize though for snapping at your original question and view point. While I disagree, I believe the subreddit is for discussion the show, and the view point that fiction doesn't need to fallow even its own laid out logic does warrants a place in the discussion.

They use the language of personal liberty and small government, but other than gun control, low taxes and the right to discriminate, they do not actually believe it. The right wing historically has been for (in no particular order):

Restricting the right to vote

Restricting immigration

Slavery

Criminalizing obscenity

Prohibition of alcohol and drugs

Regressive taxation

Nationalism and criminalizing dissent

Deference to the police

Segregation

Criminalizing sexuality

weakening freedom of religion

Press censorship

Denying a right to privacy

Restricting freedom of assembly

Broadly speaking, of the Bill of Rights (the first ten ammendments to the US constitution), the American right wing actively opposes:1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

The left generally oppose: 2 and 10

As for your counter-argument, I am a little confused.  You are now saying that if inheritance tax was 100%, people would opt to leave their careers in search of better paying jobs?  This is the opposite of logic. The extra money they have the ability to earn is **worth even less** under a higher tax.  The incentive to switch jobs for more money is lessened.

&gt;Still, I think 100% inheritance tax is one of the stupidest things I've ever read on the subject of taxation.

As I've said elsewhere, I would personally put an allowance which most would meet, but still can see why someone would want 100%.  I disagree that it is ""one of the most stupid things you've read"" and say its actually probably just one of the most different things you've read, and you've reacted as many do to things that are radically different: with immediate furore.",null,0,null,1428951794,null,0,false,0,cqb3v78,null,t3_32fimi,null,t1_cqb3v78,null,t1_cqb3174,null,null,null,1432369168,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

This one is mine.  My Uncle and Aunt knew both the woman and man involved and my family live very close to Drumkeeragh.  I remember when I was younger the forest used to be quite popular and well used but after the murder people stopped going and the council/forestry folk seem to have abandoned it.


This has resulted in a place with a scary story that is now deserted and desolate. Its run down and haggard and all the paths are well on  their way to being overgrown.  The setting in itself is quite remote, at the heel of Sleive Croob and there is nearly always wind cutting through the trees making all sorts of unnatural noises.

I love takin the dog up on summer nights and follow the fire roads deep into the woods. I'm an adult and hold the firm belief I'm the scariest mother fucker out there but with the story of the murder in your head and the general ambiance it makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end at times.  The bit that really freaks me out is the bit where the murder actually happened my dog always acts funny! 


If the macabre in anyway interests you and you like the feeling of making your self a bit afraid read into the story and go walking!

&gt; Media portrayals of Northern Ireland tend to focus on a few staunchly nationalist or unionist low-income areas. Are middle class areas, particularly of Belfast, more mixed? 

Yes and no. You will find lower-middle class areas right beside working class areas, some roads get nicer as you travel along them, and if they are in a certain ""area"" its more likely to be one or the other. Likewise, a lot of people who grew up in a working class area, ""made it"" and are now middle class, end up buying a house close to where they grew up. Because they are middle class makes them no less or more bigoted, thats a personal issue. 

&gt; What's so great about the Nolan show? 

Nothing in particular, I listen to his radio show most days to keep up to date with whats happening. I don't watch his TV show often but we have a serious lack of real current affairs talk shows and he fills a big gap. 

&gt; Was there any unionist response to the changes to the Irish constitution that culminated in the declaration of a republic in 1948?

Yes. I don't have sources at hand but they're out there. You have to remember that the northern establishment was also the government, the faces changed now and again but the attitudes evolved to be even more hardline against the south - when the south became a republic, rejected the monarchy and established its constitution, unionists were outraged at the monarch not being involved in the rest of ireland, but felt they were right because of the privileged position of the catholic church in the constitution. The relations between the two states around that time is interesting because of the war, there was a lot of talking, shouting and helping. 

&gt; Is there a religious aspect to the Loyalist love for Israel, in the US many of our right-wing Christians love Israel for religious reasons, is there such a sentiment among hard-core loyalists in NI?

Yes, we have a breed of evangelical christianity that has a lot of close links with the US and believe that ulster protestants are the ""lost people"" or whatever shite it is. With hardcore loyalists its not the same, its not religious in that way, more the idea of a small country defending itself against people who don't want it around, a comparison with NI. 

&gt; Do Sinn Fein members tend to deny Adams' IRA or just shrug it off/not care?

Every Shinner I've met will always deny Adams was in the IRA.

&gt; Ian Paisley said that part of being an Ulsterman was by nature being an Irishman, does this sentiment survive within loyalism or has the idea of Ireland as a foreign country destroyed the link to the loyalism that existed while Ireland was part of the UK?

This is a very very complicated question, you could write a PhD on it. I'm not a loyalist either, I just know a lot of them. You need to look at the definition of Irishness. Most people see Irish and Ireland as the mainstream culture of the island - GAA, modern popular culture, religion, and in the north politics as well. Ian Paisleys first and foremost opposition to the rest of Ireland was theological, NI was the last deeply devout protestant country anywhere close by and was very reluctant to change with the times and he wanted to keep it that way. He had no problem seeing himself as an Irishman in the same way that Edward Carson seen himself as an Irishman but British. 

Its even more complicated than that, but loyalism in general views the rest of Ireland as foreign because of a change of attitude from the start of the conflict until the end, mainly thanks to the IRA.

Mignolet - High 70s/Low 80s is where he should be at, maybe slightly improved kicking stat but his first half could balance it out and keep him the same (or 81)
 
Coutinho - Fair possibility, I expect him to get at least 82. Wonder goals will probably get him to 83. 

Raheem - Seems fair, he has been our most consistent player.

Moreno - Not sure if I agree with this, though I don't know his stat breakdown his defensive woes might prevent an increase.

Marko - He probably has proven himself somewhat enough to get a raise, could just as easy stay the same.

Lallana - Definitely don't agree with this, if anything he'll get reduced in rating. I expect he'll stay the same. 

Hendo - Seems fair, I expected him to be 80 last year so it's hard to know whether he'll get a bump, though he has definitely improved. 

Allen - Probably warrants it, I used to hate him being in the team outside of Man City games (might be harsh though), but now he puts a decent shift in though by no means proven himself yet.

Sakho - Not sure if he will get a raise, very hard to say but an 81/82 rating should be definite.

Skrtel - Been great, can't argue with this.

Lucas - Been more important this year, but can't see him changing either. 

Ibe - Seems about right, maybe his lack of game time will cause his raise to be smaller though mid-low 70s. 

Can - Proven he is a good PL player, so yeah no complaints. 

Borini - You have your reasons, would think he is about the same as last year if not worse but position change makes sense.

Balo - Can't argue, should be even lower but doubt EA will do that. 

Sturr - Looks no where near the player he was since coming back, injury problems hindered his season and remains to be seen how much he'll pick up. If he resembles his normal form he'll stay but if he continues misfiring he'll drop to 82.

Democracy is not an answer to this.  Democracy is a means to an end, and nobody seems to be able to answer how making the Upper House more democratic would make it any better at its job.

The Lords is first and foremost a revising chamber that has the time and the resources to go through legislation with a fine-toothed comb, often looking at clauses that the Commons doesn't have the time to even consider.

Making the House more technocratic, by filling it with expertise and experience as I have suggested above, would give it more scope to look at the possible real life effects of the legislation it considers.

Making it more democratic instead just throws spanners in the works.  Currently, though the parties have the significant presence in the Lords, the party whips are largely reduced to pleading - there is nothing they can do to Peers that really threatens them.  If you introduce elections, you make the whips far more powerful because they would ultimately have the nuclear option of deselection.  That alone would in all likelihood make the front benches considerably more powerful.

What's better in a revising chamber - voting for what you know is the right thing for a piece of legislation, or voting because your party says that's the way it should be?  That's what we should be asking ourselves.

By all means reform the Lords, but reform it in a way that makes it better at its job - and that involves making it *less* partisan, not more.",null,0,null,1428952586,null,0,1428953951,0,cqb4dn5,null,t3_32fh5n,null,t1_cqb4dn5,null,t1_cqb3dit,null,null,null,1432369410,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

Technically, you don't really have to go that far back. It sounds a bit odd to me.

Erm what? If they are after references, the referee should be able to back you up. It is not your job to prove that you lived there. That's what you are paying the letting agent to do! 

&gt; The letting agent is asking us to pay upfront a referencing fee of £500, which is non refundable in the case that our references are deemed unacceptable for any reason

Pretty standard but fucking hell, £500 is steep! Mine was only £90 for 2 people! Make sure that is what it is going towards before you pay them anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Our combined incomes are around 70x the monthly rent for the property we are looking at, and even on our own we each could easily afford to pay the rent and utility bills for the property.

Doesn't mean squat if you can't provide the paperwork sadly. You can pay upfront but not all landlords are happy with that due to it being able to pay off a chunk of mortgage but still have to make payments which the rent would have paid.

&gt; Both of us have no history of poor credit

In actuality, trade negotiations basically enjoy the privilege of cabinet confidentiality for reasonable reasons - We might say ""we'll cut steel tariffs to zero"" as a negotiating tactic, or even legitimately in the hope of getting something similar in return. But regardless, just because that was put on the table you'll be labelled an enemy of the steel industry for life. Except multiply that by every sector in every country.

24th April City away, well I this is one that is the  hardest to predict city have the ability and players to steam roll most teams in the league but they look to have thrown in the towel already. A lot of the players there now look like they're already looking at summer thinking there gunna be moving teams. We all know that they need a major overhaul this summer and lots of players are going to be shown the door, highest average age this season and going from champions to what looks like 4th place team. Their defence has been quite shocking all year, what ever back four they play were gunna get chances kompany will probably get the job of looking after benteke and I think benteke has kompany all day long this season. Mangala well he's a loose cannon often out of position and about senseless gabby (if fit) will expose his lapses in concentration, demichels is slow gabby beats him everyday of the week. The mid of city are poor in defence and will leave holes I except a high scoring shootout.  3-2 villa. 

2nd may Everton home. 
Everton have had a terrible season. There defence has been exposed nearly every game, but since exiting Europa have looked better, again I think gabby and benteke will have some fun playing against Everton especially if either distan or Alcaraz plays. I'd expect to see jags and stones which would pose more problems but are not going to keep a clean sheet. If lukakau is out injured I think we can keep a clean sheet here. I can't see why mirales isn't playing every game for Everton he seems to be a match winner on his day and his speed is formidable. I think a close match 1 or 2 goals for villa nothing for Everton.  1-0 villa

9th Hammers home
They have nothing to play for anymore, after a blistering start to the season the hammers have stalled big time. Injuries have had an effect on their season for sure but they still have not found a way to win matches since loosing a few key players at a time. I think it's time for big Sam to get some of his own medicine, long balls to benteke and flicks on to gabby will cause big problems for the hammers. I don't think we have to much to worry from them going forward just need the players to be disciplined and keep on their toes for long balls and flick ons. This could be a long range game where the ball spends more time in the air than on the floor but I cannot see them posing us a problem.  2-0 villa

16th The Saints away
This could be our hardest game in the run in because of their defence. Its their strongest attribute this season and Forster could still pick up golden glove even with missing the last part of the season with injury. The saints though are not firing well down the other end pelle has seen his goals dry up over the season and although he got one last weekend I don't see him regaining his best form. They have decent players all over the pitch though and could score from midfield or one of the wing backs. We could have won in the reverse fixture but a lapse in concentration lost us the game. I think we go in try and get an early goal and force them to attack us. 2-1 villa

24th Burnley home

What ever position Burnley are in they are going to want to win this game. If they are in with a chance of staying up they are going to attack and try and win the game. If they are going down their going to want to finish with a bang and leave an impression. This will be tough and could easily turn into a high scoring shootout. This is going to be a great game for the neutrals. It will be like the qpr game a full on proper cup tie game. Burnley don't have to quality or flair of the top teams and they don't have any world class players but they have a whole lotta heart and courage. I don't think I've ever seen them give up in a game and they have shown that they aren't afraid of big clubs and world class players. In Danny Ings they have a natural goal scorer and most of their midfield have a goal in them. Defensively they have a good go there not afraid of taking out players fairly but strongly and they let you know your in for a match. If villa are safe by this game it's going to be a great match to watch if we aren't however this is going to be excruciating to watch. 4-3 villa. 

On the other teams Hull and Sunderland and West Brom could easily go down as they all seem to have fallen off the wagon. Hull I can't see taking even one point from their last 6.

&gt; And to be honest, I didn't even know we had a culture sector. What good has that done? Even if we did have it, the government would probably kill it with death anyways. Besides, A government should run the country, not stuff money into ""culture"".

There's a reason why tourists come here. They come to here, spend and leave. What does it mean? It means almost all of their money spent is profit instead of most other methods which involve some kind of investment, ongoing maintenance, etc meaning in the end, we may earn little using other method compared to tourism. [The Business Insider article mentions the $16 billion figure likely to be spent in 2013.](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-popular-tourist-destinations-2013-2013-6?op=1&amp;IR=T)

Department for Culture Media and Sport's job is to ensure that the tourism money keeps flowing in. That's a small part of what they do. Essentially, they promote us so other people spend their money on us instead of other countries.

&gt;as it happens, no body uses the cycle lanes in Newcastle and they have been placed in stupid places which cause bottle-necks.

That's more of council's job isn't it? Promoting cycling through a government scheme could do wonders to that cycling lane. A city where everyone bikes instead of using cars like cities in Denmark and Netherlands would be great.

&gt;Climate change has been brought into doubt anyways. just because there is more CO2 does not mean there is less oxygen. and plants thrive on more CO2 so the atmosphere balances it's self out anyways.

Plants adapting to use up more CO2 doesn't happen quickly. It takes a while. Also, we're killing the plants off, so, in future there may be not enough plants to convert CO2 into O2.

&gt;the polar caps have a habit of getting bigger or smaller every 30 000 years, and we have little information on it anyways. we were supposed to hit the ""no way back"" point in the 80's and since the UK produces less than 2% of the worlds CO2. it makes no difference what we do when America has refused to look at CO2 levels.

Do you realise that many of what we eat, heavily depends on climate. If the climate is changed, many people will die due to malnutrition. What if we invented something that could reverse the climate change? What if it's slow and needed more time? That 2% could make a huge difference.

Also, if we all start caring about climate change, America will soon follow the suit.

&gt;The department of culture is expensive, and it has no effect on real culture. Real culture comes from the people. not from your tax payers money.

They earn more money than what we spend into that department. 

&gt;As for wind farms, it's just a scam. all the construction firms involved in wind farms are part of the establishment. they simply secured massive government contracts for themselves. go and look at how many politicians have invested in wind farms! you'd be surprised!

Nobody really can.  And at least part of that is because it wouldn't necessarily make it better its job. Another part is that they don't really understand what its job is aside from it being somewhere las are made. 

Further, they're blinded by the buzzword that is 'democracy' led by political parties, to such an extent that they believe that by applying democracy to all sorts of problems it will 'fix' them like some sort of magic wand.

At this same age range it's also one of the worst for depression in my opinion, if you haven't got a job or a partner there's that, being alone, dealing with benefits etc. If you can't provide for your family or do the things that society has drilled in to your head are a man's responsibilities that's another path to misery. If you're in your mid 20's and have just graduated and can't seem to get a career, if a long term relationship breaks down, if you're stuck in a dead end job, debts, trouble with kids etc. There are a lot of things going on in a mans life at that point, or at least you believe there should be and that can lead to depression and desperation.

She fucked up, she needed to apologise and she did. End of. 

She didn't deserve the sheer scale of abuse she got, and plenty of faceless anonymous Twitter users once again showed how repugnant they are - and it's not impossible some get prosecuted if they went far enough to warrant it, but that doesn't make her completely unaccountable for a pretty serious faux pas.

Perhaps, but I also think that Dembele and a lot of the other players brought in ~2012 have the mentality that they deserve more than the Spurs side that they're currently in. 

Dembele is a player that believes he should be playing CL, he is also a player that may or may not believe he is good enough for Madrid (we have Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand to thank for that).

If you're into history, then Pevensey castle is well worth a visit, it's about half an hour away on the train. Bodiam castle is even better but you'll need access to a car to get there. Battle Abbey, on the site of the Battle of Hastings, is supposedly worth visiting, but to my shame I've never actually visited. Despite being from the area, I've only driven past countless times. I don't recommend Hastings castle, it's a bit crap.

This is precisely why I made the judgement I did about your sense of entitlement. You see only one side of the picture and assume you are the one getting a raw deal when the reality is that rights are overwhelmingly on the side of tenants rather than landlords. 

That aside, my earlier comment was clearly trying to help you find a way to overcome the concern about not having a complete reference history and the best ways of doing that. But your attitude towards landlords doesn't do you any favours either and you really do need to round out your perspective a bit more to understand the issue more fully. I've been a landlord and a tenant (as well as both at the same time in fact) and having seen things from both sides tenants have a much, *much* better deal than many of them realise. I'm sorry you had a problem landlord previously and agencies tended to be crappy, but for the money they make of letting in proportion to the costs of running the business they don't always get to employ the pick of the litter and a lot of people in the business are the sort of people you'd not chose unless you had no other choice. 

Like I said earlier though, proof of salary and/or offering a higher deposit should help overcome any hesitation your landlord has about you not having a full reference history.

I guess a few extra things for Partick Thistle could be:

Higginbotham has been bizarrely mediocre given his absolutely sublime performances last season. 

Abdul Osman has been excellent in his first season, really solid defensive mid fielder who can actually pass a ball (I know, a rare luxury in Scotland). 

If we stay up then we've managed to complete 2 seasons in the top flight without being relegated for the first time since the 90's (sad I know, but I'm very happy about this). 

Archibald is doing very well with what we have available (hardly anything), and I'm happy with the team performance in general. I'm slightly annoyed we keep losing the head and players get sent off at Parkhead, it's hard enough with 11 on the park but with 10 it's nigh on impossible.

What I mean is that for the owner to be hypocritical, he would have to be *both* taking a stance against the non-dom status while also maintaining his non-dom status. As it is, he is not obviously influencing the Guardian's stance on non-doms (presumably...), and so he may well be consistent in his having **and** supporting of the non-dom status.

Tactics Tims didn't play him, except for the one substitution in a losing game (I think it was Man City) and it was kinda like an ""EF you"" to Holtby... Though Tim was calling everyone out at the time. 

Poch, obviously, only used him for the pre-season. But many of the people who watched the games were excited to see him play in a CAM role with the new Poch system. But the games after the Sounders, it seems that Poch preferred him as the defensive CM of the two we have in Mason-Bentaleb.

The kid ran and was very aggressive. But the game against Schalke, he showed too much aggression and a lack of purpose with his runs. Maybe it was the fact that it was Schalke. Maybe it was the fact that he had been playing as a CAM until that game. 

Either way, we are not too clear on his role if he comes back. I wouldn't be surprised if Poch recalls him to give Christian some rest. I hope that's the case, cause Paulinho as a CAM experiment has yet to get our team anywhere. Except for that one game where Poch put in all ""AVB purchases"" instead of his preferred team.

I like what I read but given their past I'm not sure if I trust they've learned from their authoritarian tendencies. I don't mean that just in the sense of their attitudes towards things like privacy and surveillance, but more in their general attitude towards society and socialism. I'm a big believer in socialism, but I'm trying to work out if my vision of socialism is aligned with the Labour vision of it. Certainly there are those within the party that share my view (normally referred to as Blue Labour), but whether they're dominant? I'm not sure. I wrote this on [the LabourList article](http://labourlist.org/2015/04/labours-manifesto-where-blue-labour-meets-brown-labour/) by Mark Ferguson titled 'Labour’s Manifesto – Where Blue Labour meets “Brown Labour”':

&gt;

&gt;I'm glad to see it, though I'd actually like to have seen a little more influence from thinkers like Cruddas. The future of socialism is not found in the increasing centralisation of power in the hands of an increasingly corrupt and unaccountable state, nor in allowing the market free-reign over our lives and communities. Real socialism must be about putting power into the hands of ordinary people: Giving communities power over the decisions that matter to them, against the power of both the state *and* market. On *some* things like railways, nationalisation might be the answer (as they seem to be a natural monopoly), but on others, we (the left) really need to ask ourselves if the answer is really to just nationalise, nationalise, nationalise. This supposed dichotomy between 'state' and 'free-market' is a false one.

&gt;A key thing missing from this manifesto for me was that nowhere that I could see did it talk about co-operatives and mutuals. Workers should own and have an influence and stake in the businesses in which they work, that should be the bar set for any party claiming to be a Social Democratic one. Labour should be doing far more to encourage citizens to create their own small co-operative businesses. It means more economic democracy, fairness, a greater emphasis on mutualism and reciprocity among communities, and another buffet against the forces of both state and unaccountable corporations. It encourages social and community cohesion and strengthens the bond between individuals, giving them a stake in their workplace and a sense of place in an increasingly globalised world. They mentioned the word 'co-operative' once in the entire manifesto, only mentioning them in regards to the British Investment Bank, though how that actually relates to co-operatives I've yet to see.",null,0,null,1428961300,null,0,false,0,cqba54v,null,t3_32gpvj,null,t1_cqba54v,null,t3_32gpvj,null,null,null,1432372195,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

By the time that hiatus ended and *Trial of a Time Lord* aired, things were still pretty unsure, so much so that Colin was actually fired from the job. Then Sylvester's first season started, still not great, not helped by the fact that Grade had slated it against *Coronation Street*, a very popular show.

So even though Sylv's last two seasons were of much better quality, the show was stuck in its terrible slot, and the new BBC1 Controller, Jonathan Powell, eventually decided to suspend the series.

Fast-forward a few years, and Fox decide they want to import the show to the US, so they make the TV Movie, set in Los Angeles to appeal to the new audience, with a new Doctor.

If I truly wanted to project my tormenting pain and burning envy, I would have told you that I am in early forties, and this year I pay the *last* set of school fees for my child, while your studies will make you pay your *first* set of school fees by my current age. Of course, if you have anything left for schools after your mortgage payments. But I won't, what's not the subject of the story.

btw, you did not answer below the question about your migrtantship. If you are from abroad, it excuses and explains everything: 

- and your non-conventional use of some idioms, 

- and ridiculously long studies (student visas -&gt; Tier1 post-study marathon makes sense for extra 8 years; in this case you spent your resources on the first-world passport, which left you without deposit for a house; if this is the case, congrats and respect!), 

- and non-earning partner (not good enough English? qualifications in non-transferable skills area?),

- and overblown feeling of entitlement, not matching the reality of an empty balance sheet,

- and genuine surprise with the house prices,

- and sweet belief that ""parnter's income does not matter"" (it matters in the first world countries at least from 70s, when the two-income families become mainstream, and markets, first and foremost housing market, absorbed these extra incomes).  

Ok, you can keep feeling sad about your ""unfair"" fate to live among the lower castes in pebbledash houses, and blame the market for being insensitive to what you see as you ""sacrifices"" (lol).

null,false,goolies,null,null,null,"&gt; would still inherit £438k, I really struggle to feel much sympathy for them considering for the vast majority it's going to be a financial windfall.

The point I'm trying to make is that they're not inheriting £438k, but rather a home. If they sell it on or rent it then yes they're getting a huge financial bonus and I think they should be taxed on that, that seems fair.


&gt;I don't know any figures but I imagine the number of people still living in their family home with their parents die is quite small.

Not necessarily, 26% of 20-34 year olds (that's 3.3 million people) live at home. Tried to look up mortality rates and average parent age but I have a dissertation to write and trying to work it out given most families have 2 parents (and then factoring in marriage rates to work out what percentage of homes would be above the threshold) got complicated... But:

* I don't think it's safe to assume, with so many people in their 20s now living at home, that the numbers are so small as to be negligible.

* Even if there are relatively few, I don't think we need a system that can essentially force people out of their homes within 6 months of a bereavement. Why not apply the tax after sale or on the first x years of rent earnt through the property?

I went to a senior accountant with the situation, for advice only. After nearly two hours his view was liquidation was the best bet as the cashflow was f*cked: we had lost £30,000 in sales and thousands more in stock. And even when th leak was fixed it couldnt be patched as the ceiling was soaked with 17 days of water from two showers. Most small businesses go bust because of cashflow. Plus the insurance - which I had, and legally had to have - would not deliver in time to keep us afloat. Voluntary Liquidation meant that the staff were properly looked after from the Government's Insolvency Fund, and that creditors were also looked after. My suppliers are ALL wanting me to reopen, had an email today from our biggest one with whom we did 6 figures of business a year, looking for news. Some of my staff also want to come back. Re banking, we were with Santander, but they viewed us a new business, so wouldn't lend. This is bollocks: we are not a new business as we have an existing product and customer base, but five years of banking with them - in which they could see the company going from nothing to something - cut no ice. Banks don't really like restaurants, and there is no support out there. Indeed when launching the first restaurant, my own personal bank said they couldn't help, but advised me to go for a loan for ""home improvement"", which I did (£25K over four years, all paid back). Am unemployed now so this isn't really an option! :)

I did pay corporation tax last year (unlike my neighbours Whorebucks), and contributed well into 6 figures of total taxation, which is far more than I ever did in my day job before Jack's. This isn't really the place to provide more financial detail, but will happily buy anyone a pint and answer their questions should they have doubt about what I am trying to do. And finally, for the customers we did have, and hope to have, the Kickstarter is simply a way of pretty much pre-paying for your food and drinks which allows us to reopen, have been as generous as I can with the offering. Hope this helps a little.

&gt; Sweet! I'd happily volunteer for that.

I agree you should be able to.

Not with equity release, remortgaging, etc.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail#The_rise_of_fascism
Lord Rothermere was a friend of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and directed the Mail's editorial stance towards them in the early 1930s.[32][33] Rothermere's 1933 leader ""Youth Triumphant"" praised the new Nazi regime's accomplishments, and was subsequently used as propaganda by them.[34] In it, Rothermere predicted that ""The minor misdeeds of individual Nazis would be submerged by the immense benefits the new regime is already bestowing upon Germany"". Journalist John Simpson, in a book on journalism, suggested that Rothermere was referring to the violence against Jews and Communists rather than the detention of political prisoners.[35]

Rothermere and the Mail were also editorially sympathetic to Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists.[36] Rothermere wrote an article entitled ""Hurrah for the Blackshirts"" in January 1934, praising Mosley for his ""sound, commonsense, Conservative doctrine"",[37] and pointing out that: ""Young men may join the British Union of Fascists by writing to the Headquarters, King's Road, Chelsea, London, S.W.""[38]

The Spectator condemned Rothermere's article commenting that, ""..the Blackshirts, like the Daily Mail, appeal to people unaccustomed to thinking. *The average Daily Mail reader is a potential Blackshirt ready made. When Lord Rothermere tells his clientele to go and join the Fascists some of them pretty certainly will*.
Some would argue that the average daily hate reader is still likely to be a raving fascist.

Because I don't think it's fair or right to potentially force a child out of their family home within 6 months of a bereavement. And I think it's the unhealthy attitude that property = £££ that's stoked our housing crisis - Whilst this move in itself obviously wouldn't address the housing crisis (thoughperhaps having only 1 home considered a family home and the others charged IHT as usual/potentially higher) I think it should be part of a cultural move away from seeing UK, and especially South East, property as investment but instead as homes.

null,false,somescott,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt;The point I'm trying to make is that they're not inheriting £438k, but rather a home. If they sell it on or rent it then yes they're getting a huge financial bonus and I think they should be taxed on that, that seems fair.


Yes but as I said before the majority of people will have their own family home by that point. And if they really desperately wanted to move into their parents home they could sell their own home to cover the costs, and if their own home and money can't cover 40% over £325k perhaps they'll just have to come to terms with the face they probably wouldn't be able to afford to live there anyway.


Not to mention the fact that if you have more than one child they're not exactly going to move in together.


The amount of people this effects in the way you are describing is far too small to change the tax over, and quite frankly it is only going to be a relatively frivolous problem for people who are well off anyway and will be able to console themselves with quite a lot of money.


&gt;Not necessarily, 26% of 20-34 year olds (that's 3.3 million people) live at home.


I'd imagine you're quite an anomaly if both your parents are dead when you're 20-34, you're also almost certainly going to be in a low socio-economic group (unless your parents died in a freak accident), so won't even be almost touched by the inheritance tax. And even if you were you wouldn't be homeless, you'd be able to buy a decent house without a mortgage.



&gt;My opinions are perhaps shaped by my personal situation, as if heaven forbid my mum (widowed but was unmarried) popped her clogs there'd be no way I or my sister could afford the inheritance tax - and not because we have an enormous house but because we live in London.


I understand your situation, and taxation is never going to be a joy, but considering the cuts coming to public services I think you would agree we have to give priority to those who are worrying about how they'll be able to afford to pay for anything before we worry about you and your sister who will be inheriting hundreds of thousands of pounds each anyway, something the poorest in society would consider a life changing lottery win.",null,1,null,1428965089,null,0,false,0,cqbce2g,null,t3_32fimi,null,t1_cqbce2g,null,t1_cqbbnap,null,null,null,1432373255,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

You also talk about monopolies, as socialists tirelessly bring up time and time again without listening to what has been said in the past, and imply that it is free market capitalism to have long-lasting monopolies regardless of service. A monopoly in itself is not a bad thing; a bad monopoly is one that provides a service which is not up to the standard for the price they are offering that service at. Ask yourself; what monopolies in history have been negative and what monopolies have been  beneficial? Was John D Rockefeller negative? What he did for the majority of his career was overwhelmingly good for society; he revolutionise modern industry and provided millions with well-paid jobs. Was his company monopolistic? Of course it was; but why was it monopolistic? He provided a service that no other company could match in terms of quality and price. His monopoly sure as hell wouldn't have lasted if he started to cut the quality of service and increase prices. So what allows these bad monopolies to exist? Well nearly every case in history has had some involvement with government, whether it be large or small involvement. Rockefeller's did this.  Look at any monopoly presently and in the past that you don't like and I guarantee you by a large margin thy will have this characteristic. The only exception I can think is Wall Street; but don't sit here and tell people that it's some 'rule of capitalism'.

I don't see how this follows. You can't find the means to pay 40% of the value above £325k within 6 months means you wouldn't be able to afford to live in the house... There was an ex-council flat on the market a while back for [£1,000,000](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/4772/1000000-ex-council-flat-sold-in-chelsea/). I don't see how not being able to pay the inheritance tax on that would mean you ""wouldn't be able to afford to live there anyway."" If you mean they wouldn't by their own merit be able to earn enough to buy it then for most people yes that's true - welcome to London. About the only thing that keeps most areas around me from being totally sterile communities of the very rich is the (limited) social housing and people who live in family homes bought years ago. I'd also be sad to see that go.



&gt;I understand your situation, and taxation is never going to be a joy


I don't think you do because it's not the tax that's the problem. I've said repeatedly if the house ever turns into a big pot of money through rent or sale I think its only fair to share it with the tax man. But right now the house isn't a big pile of money, it's my family home and one that has a lot of history to it, even if you don't buy the sentimentalism. My problem isn't my desire not to pay inheritance tax, it's the way the system is designed and the hugely over-inflated house prices of London and the South East.

The huge proportion of income tax generated by the wealthy is just a reflection of the scale of inequality. The top 1% provide 24.1% of income tax but they have equivalent wealth to the bottom 60% of people. 

   It is absurd to make a moral argument for the correct particular percentage to take based on how a number feels.

If you're going to advocate for weed, be honest with yourself and say ""It makes me feel good and I want it"" because I can believe you there. ""Weed cures cancer"" is a dangerous belief that has very little evidence to support it, and you can tell that they don't give a fuck about cancer patients because of their reactions when the option of taking the active ingredient out of weed and using it in proper medicine is offered.

""Weed has no side effects"" is also a stupid belief, since getting high in the first place is a side effect. All the shaky studies that are spewed out at every turn don't say ""The mouse cells we injected with THC got so high that the cancer just disappeared"". The next step would be to find out what is in THC that supposedly has these effects, extract it, remove any side effects (getting high etc.) and then up the dose to be used in pill form. But nooo!

Our back 4 are much more used to playing it altogether an there's less ground of the CBs and wide players to cover defensively. Lucas' best position is the single pivot and I believe Henderson works best with Lucas behind him. Allen can play all 3 midfield positions and as a 3 we have 2 with a very high work rate and a willingness to close down. Then a pretty good sweeper right behind them. Sterling is naturally a winger, along with Markovic and Ibe. All positions, take RW for example, can ask for multiple roles depending on who is playing there and who we play agains. Coutinho and lallana on the wings will probably drop off and cut inside more allowing the fullbacks to overlap. Markovic and sterling would stay wider giving more room to Henderson an Allen supporting through the middle. 

I think the 3-4-2-1 was used more as a defensive strategy than anything else and hoping to get the best out of 2 CAMs that were allowed to roam.

The back four is a question of who to play. Johnson is the only rb we have that attacks and defends decently. I like manquillo but i don't think he is good enough to start regularly. Can could play there but i actually really liked him playin in the cb role because it allowed him lucas and Johnson to all switch places freely. Moreno is the obvious left back choice but then who is the other cb. i think lovren is better in the lb spot then in the right and skrtel is arguably our best defender. so my back four would be can, skrtel, lovren, Moreno until sakho is back.

null,false,WhaleMeatFantasy,null,null,null,"&gt; The book of Genesis is sort of a quibble with science.

It's not. It's a pre-scientific book. If you read it intelligently as what it is (rather than try and twist it like fundamentalists) then there is no quibble. Personally I have never met an Anglican who feels there is any conflict between mainstream science and their faith.

&gt;Then the Christians I meet need to stop being the antithesis of their philosophy.

I quite agree. But it's always odd when people argue that because some people don't follow their philosophy that therefore the philosophy is wrong. Or that because the philosophy isn't well taught it shouldn't be taught at all.

If you stop a bunch of adults on the street and ask them the key points about evolution a large number wouldn't be able to tell you what they are. The solution is to teach evolution better--not to stop teaching it entirely.

&gt;surely the fact that 63% of the population don't practice Christianity would mean that it's not a religious country any more

Sure, you can argue this if that's what you want your understanding of a Christian country to be. But equally that's a very specific, modern, protestant understanding of what faith is--personal belief in a God. Historically that has not been the case.

For example, priests used to carry out religious rituals on behalf of the community who did not need to be present--laymen were actually not allowed to be present in the holy space when rituals were underway. Many people have the image that people used to go to Communion every Sunday and that that is what it means to be Christian. Back in the day (when we perceive people were 'really' religious) people might only commune once a year.

So in fact to take a long-term perspective, being a Christian country isn't about x many people going to Church and it never has been. It's about the structures which underlie society and culture, and basic moral orientations. Not much has changed in that respect.",null,0,null,1428972827,null,0,false,0,cqbgwj9,null,t3_32exew,null,t1_cqbgwj9,null,t1_cqaw8zs,null,null,null,1432375452,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

It makes for a fairly significant contrast when, later in the serial, the Doctor picks up a blaster and announces that he's going to kill Davros because the whole ugly scenario and everyone that had died in the conflict so far was indirectly his fault for failing to do so when he had the opportunity before. Ultimately, the Doctor isn't able to execute the man face-to-face, but he's remarkable unconcerned with releasing canisters of a horrible deadly virus in the middle of a dalek fire-fight.

In the event that we bring in a bunch of new, young faces, and use the Europa League exclusively to rotate the squad and go as far as our young/squad players take us, then I'm all for it. 

The problem is that a few things have all been true of the Europa League for us in the last three or so years:

- We play like dogshit on sundays after a EL game

- We don't tend to actually do much rotation, annoyingly (ergo my point that I'd support it more if we did)

- We risk injury in the early rounds, when we're forced to play on moonscape pitches in the middle of some random former soviet country on the other side of the Continent.  I'm sick of it.  We have to endure shit just because it's the only realistic way a mid table Romanian club is going to be able to keep up with us, no disrespect whatsoever to the Romanians, mind you.

- We don't gain *ANYTHING* tangible outside of that.  The money is pretty garbage for the majority of the tournament in terms of revenue, advertising, kit sponsorships, etc. and as soon as it starts to get better, a bunch of Champions League clubs appear in the tournament having played half as many games to get to that stage, against more analogous competition, and in better conditions.  Suddenly you have to play a team that provides a real tie, but they've been through fewer games, against better European competition, so they come out fresher and playing at a higher level out of the gate often times.  I'd be interested to hear the last time the Europa League winner didn't start the tournament in the Champion's League.


So in conclusion, it pains me to say it, but I think we're actually worse off playing in the tournament next year than not.  All of those travel days to random parts of the continent get used to train, build the system, work on integrating new players into the system, etc.  We would still be able to do some rotating in Cup games, and would also, god willing, have the depth of talent to be able to rotate in league games occasionally without feeling like we're hobbling ourselves completely.  It would be lovely to not feel obliged to play the same midfield/striker/wingers in order to have any semblance of a chance because it would make our best 11 all the more fit, rested, and motivated (if they had someone to compete with). 

Edit: I do want to say though that I think you lay out your point well.  I wouldn't go lumping the whole sub into it though-- a lot of us are fed up with the Europa League, but if we were to make it into the tournament again next year, I would support the team just like everyone else would be.  Where I really lose the thread is when I see people suggest that we throw a game to fall out of a competition so that we can ""Get more rest"".  I hate that.  If you're in a competition, you're in it to win it.

I've enjoyed the Europa League over the last few years. We get to play some interesting teams, get a fun cup run and the best atmosphere for the last few seasons has been thursday nights - and the easiest for me to get to.

But it gets to the stage where I feel like I've seen it all with Europa. When you look at the season's that United and Liverpool have had in their europe-less seasons and the negative effect that qualifying has had on Everton this year it really makes you think what missing a year could do for us.

Correct me if I'm wrong but Poch said his goal was to win the PL. if we take a year off to reboot the team and get some rest for our young players, instead of running the same 13-14 players ragged, we might actually have a shot at that. 

Dump the garbage (kabs, ade, bobby, and pauli) and sign some worthwhile individuals with our newly assembled scouting team (see recent news). Poch just got full control of the squad from levy this year. I mean a year off from Europe is exactly what we need if you ask me! We're still playing in arguably the best league in the world in three different competitions. We don't need to travel to turkey mid-week to play besisktas in a group game in the Europa league the week before we play our biggest rival in our own league. We play Chelsea, ManU, Man City, Arsenal, and Liverpool twice a year at least. We just don't need the stress of it man, give the team some time to find an identity instead of having to shuffle around players on almost a daily basis. 

Top four certainly sounds attractive but the idea of winning the league gets me got and bothered. I just don't see us doing that if we don't take time off from Europe to reboot the system.

null,false,jjones217,num23,,null,"I agree that any chance to watch Spurs play real, competitive football is a good thing (I just can't get behind friendlies, whether it's for club or country).

The problem for so long, in my opinion, is that Spurs don't approach the Europa League from the same perspective that you're talking about. Granted, if we were in the Champions League, we'd have to play that way, but if we're playing to get *into* the CL, we should be reserving our best players for Saturdays and Sundays.

What's happened in the past, though it got better this season, was that Spurs would play 7-8 of the same players on Sunday as they did on Thursday, which is why the performances are always shit following a EL match. Player's are jetlagged from traveling to Uzbekistan and they're legs aren't recovered from whole-assing the 2nd half after half-assing the 1st and having to play from behind.

Spurs have a large squad with a lot of talented players. In my opinion, and I know they're like assholes and some of them stink, but in my opinion, Europa League, as well as the League Cup and FA Cup, should be used as follows:

1. Get your top subs a full match. Spurs are deep enough to play a fully rotated squad in other competitions. There's no use wasting our top 11 against shit teams. Conversely, when we play a good team, it's a good experience for our young players and those who have been struggling to get premier league action a chance to play against better competition.

2. It's a chance to rotate out of form and out of shape players. Want to get Soldado's confidence back? Non-PL competitions are the way to go. Want to see if you can build back trust with Ade? Use the EL. Want to see if Yedlin has the defensive skills to match his pace? Use the cups. 

The PL is literally the only competition that matters unless you get to a quarterfinal. From then on, you can play with your top guys because winning is a real possibility and you want to get that silverware. I'm glad we made it to the league cup final, even if we lost, it was good for fan morale and it was a good competition to watch.

The same would have been said with the Europa League. I have no problem with it if we make it to the last 8. If we were in the EL right now, I'd be ecstatic, especially after our shit performances in the PL over the past two weeks. Having a shot at CL qualification through the EL would be great for the club. But  back in December it felt like an unwanted/unneeded distraction.

I want us to qualify for the EL next year, and if Scum (gag) win the FA Cup, we *should* have nothign to worry about on that end. If not, then we need to at least get our shit together enough to beat Southampton or Liverpool to 6th.",null,0,null,1428976037,null,0,false,0,cqbis7g,null,t3_32i417,null,t1_cqbis7g,null,t3_32i417,null,null,null,1432376338,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

null,false,severedfragile,lfc68,,null,"His positioning is terrible because he's always chasing the ball, which means he gets dribbled past or isn't even in a position to stop players. He's not good at reading the build-up - the best way to stop an attack is to force players out of the places they want to be in and close the gaps that allow them to move forward and release/receive the ball, which is something Lucas doesn't do - he attacks danger rather than preventing it. He's good at winning the ball off players, but when he's not doing that he's not protecting the defence enough. He also gives away silly fouls in dangerous positions.

Other than that last point, most of that is what's to be expected - he wasn't brought to the club as a DM, he arrived as a more box-to-box player, and while his role's changed he's still a CM - a defensive-minded one, but still a central midfield player rather than a specialised defensive midfielder. You can see that in how good his movement often is in the transitional phases when we win the ball, or how quickly he moves it. One of the areas he excels in - and his performance today is as good an example as any - is doing a containing job when we're on the attack and the rest of the midfield is moving up, he's actually very good at reading play just inside the opposing half and reviving attacks as soon as we lose the ball. But yeah, it is a problem when he's asked to play DM. It's not so bad when the 3 in midfield work as a unit but he's not able to do a good enough shielding job on his own. He's the most defensive out of Allen and Henderson, but Allen's positioning and shepherding is much better. Lucas wasn't brought to Liverpool to play DM and the only reason he does is because the only real DM at the club is currently one of our centre-backs. It's one thing if he's part of a deep 2, but he can't do the role himself. It's about closing gaps and walling opponents in, and he can't do that. I know it's an observational  argument rather than an empirical one, but look at the work Matic does off the ball and look at how little Lucas does off the ball besides chasing it.

2. When Amy meets the Doctor she lives with her aunt and when the universe is rebooted we find out that it's because the crack ate her parents. So already neither Amy nor River should exist.

3. In the forest while Amy has her eyes closed and the soldiers go off 1 by 1 and get erased they are just gone. no one magically appears to replace them. that wasn't family members vanishing, that was a military operation where if that particular person didn't exist then another soldier would've been there instead. 
If people being erased fully molded the timeline to the way it would be if they never existed then there would've been a near endless supply of soldiers appearing then getting sucked into the crack.

Therefore I believe that the universe repairing around what vanishes isn't taking apart and properly fixing what's been damaged, its it's just duct taping the broken pieces back over the hole and hoping no one notices.
