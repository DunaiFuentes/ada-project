null,false,jasonalangraves,null,null,null,"I am an Emergency Medicine doctor from the US working in the UK and thought I would share my experiences.

First off, waiting times in ED and the huge number of patients attending ED can be found in all modern health systems. This is not a UK unique problem.

Please DO BE PROUD of your NHS. Where I am from in the US, bankruptcy from hospital bills is not unusual.

Everybody benefits from good roads and infrastructure. Same with healthcare. I am so proud and honored to work in the NHS where people need not worry if they can afford to come and see me.

Out of 100 people I see in ED, about 5 to 10 are what I would say are real emergencies.

That does not mean the other cases should not come to ED however.

If there is anything that worries you, I want to see you because I love my job and seeing you. But I would kindly ask for you to be considerate about it. I have to see sicker people first, and if I have no single solitary private exam space to consult with you in, again, there will be a wait.

Parents, please buy a book or get some sense. Out of 100 paeds attendances, maybe 1 or 2 are ED worthy. I won't prescribe an antibiotic for your kids runny nose. Your GP didn't thus in all likelihood nor will I. Your kid has a virus and will feel like shit for weeks. I have nothing to offer that will change this. And when you don't like this, please don't kick off, it still will not cause me to suddenly convert your kids viral illness into one that needs an antibiotic. That being said, if you are worried, I want to see you.

If you have not vaccinated your kids....well I would like to say something different, but I'll phrase it more kindly. I hope at some point the law of the land will consider this to be abuse and neglect.

Huge waits in ED seem more a consequence of lack of space in ED for the volumes of patients now attending ED and also lack of hospital inpatient beds for those needing admission from ED. 

Please, I beg, do not attack me because of the waiting time. I do not control central government policy on NHS funding of expansion and the loss of social care funding that traps people who need social care for discharge in the hospital and thus blocking the bed. I don't want anybody waiting for more than 30 minutes, but at the moment, given the number of exam spaces and inpatient beds, waits will get longer as patient volumes will only increase whilst funding is falling.

I do think certain presentations should be charged in full for their ED attendance such as alcohol intoxication, illicit drug overdoses and deliberate self harm.

Lastly, people and conditions change. We can only treat and diagnose based upon the information and data available at the time, not information and data that arises at some point in the future. Your heart attack now was not because this was missed last week when you came. Last week, it was acid reflux on the basis of the evidence available then, now it is something different.

If you want change in the NHS, choose wisely at the ballot box. I have no idea who is the best political party. I do like Jeremy Hunt's ideas about efficiency however, I do believe his ideas are the way forward. I suspect most UK doctors will disagree however.

Please limit the number of people accompanying you to ED as most patients are made uncomfortable by your noisy and often annoying relatives and friends.",null,0,null,1423727980,null,0,false,0,coj2bzd,null,t3_2vj2ae,null,t1_coj2bzd,null,t3_2vj2ae,null,null,null,1424546164,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Basing yourself near London is good but no go explore other parts of England, and check out Scotland and Wales as well (just remember to file your T51 crossing form with the Home Office online before going between E, S and W or there is a £75 fine).

There are quite a few differences you may notice that others point out. A lot of big things are obvious, like different phrases and food. But smaller things catch you out too - for example the thing I didn't realise was odd in the UK until I went abroad was that taxis often ask you to pre-pay an low estimate of the total  (eg if the total will be around £20 the driver may ask for £15). This makes it less of an issue if you abscond at the end (not that you would I'm sure), also important as some unscrupulous drivers won't do this with tourists and then will pretend to have no change at the end of the journey so you overpay! May be an issue for you if you live near London or another big city.

Meanwhile the average narrow country lane has the national speed limit of 60mph - actually driving that speed would just be *utterly* insane! 

Most of the speed cameras I see tend to be on motorway gantries, yet motorways are the safest of all the roads. You hardly ever see cameras on narrow country roads, yet these are the most dangerous roads.

Now there is a good chance that a lot of the individuals following the new ideology would not kill themselves, but do you really believe a majority would intervene and step forward from the crowd to stop the killing of someone different?

* [Wikipedia's article on tipping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratuity) is great for an overview of tipping culture around the world. Don't feel bad in the UK about not tipping everywhere - we have minimum wages that somewhat reflect the cost of living and don't expect tips (in tipping jobs) to make up a deficit in the wage.
* Don't be afraid not to drink tea - I'm a national and I don't often :P
* This is a huge thing, judging from my american fiancée and my time in the US. Everything's relative: we're a geographically small country so stuff is mostly close by; you can get a long way across the country in two hours, so it seems like a long drive. Conversely in some places in the US (hello midwest) it can take 2 hours to go shopping, right? So you think nothing of it, because it's geographically huge and everywhere's spaced out.
* Related to the above: Public. Transport. You can cross the country(ies) without driving and certainly for actual local travel embrace it. Depending where you go your mileage may vary, but Nottingham, for example, has great public transport, and London is well supported by public transport because it has to be (though said transport tends to be incredibly busy).
* An acceptable thing to say to strangers as you pass them in the street (which might confuse you) is ""Alright?"". British people say this as a rhetorical ""hey, how's it going?"" (which is often replied to with ""Alright."" in agreement) not ""oh my god, it looks like something is wrong with you; are you ok?"" which I believe is a common confusion for foreigners.
* It doesn't rain ALL the time. But seriously, you'll get used to the rain. When it ""snows"", the country shuts down, in response to about an inch, because even though we knew it was coming because it was forecast and it happens *every year* at the end of Jan/ start of Feb, no one bothered to prepare the grit trucks. The cold is a damp cold, not a dry icy cold. +2 degrees Celsius here feels colder and more uncomfortable than -7 in Minnesota (source: I was there last March). Also, we don't use Fahrenheit, like, at all. Sorry.
* I chuckled at ""fashionable git"".

Yeah the cultural differences are shrinking in many ways, there is (and has been for years) americanisation occurring in Britain, but people are weirdly specific about their resistances to it. Language, for example: Better make sure you include those extra u's or you'll be dishonoured in a colourful way. But ""awesome"", ""google"" as a verb? These things are fine entering our lexicon. Better not call ""crisps"" ""chips"". Also bear that one in mind. Recently some Americans over here for business picked up a pack of crisps at a Burger Van and said ""we'll just have these chips"" and were then surprised when they got some fries too. Still don't know if they paid for the crisps...

I woke up yesterday morning to watch the game (was on at like 4 a.m. my time) and thought to myself ""*I don't even care if we lost. We've been playing so well and Liverpool are on form and a lot of our players are bound to be tired. If we have to lose any game during this stretch of February play, might as well be Liverpool.""*

Of course, after the game started and we conceded, I was bit annoyed, especially given how cheap of a goal it seemed to be (not blaming Lloris, it just seemed like a goal we could have prevented).

But MAN was I ever proud when HurryKane equalised it for us. And then when we equalized again after two. I was just thinking the whole time - under AVB last year, or even Timmy, going down on goals like those would have totally done us in, especially in a place like Anfield. Hell, even going down 1-0 at home vs. Arsenal last year would be a death sentence (and it was).

But damn. I love Poch. I liked the way we played under 'Arry, though I didn't really like him all that much as a person.

Lots of good shops, not much green space but a nice little non league football team (Bootle) if you're into that sort of thing. Plus the Racecourse has boxing, motorbikes, computer fairs and other events. You'll have no problem working in Aintree at all. 

Maghull - A bit out the way if you're hoping to get into Liverpool often but it's on the train line. The Lydiate end has nice houses, lots of space, decent pubs and plenty of green space. The schools are OK as well.

Crosby - If you're driving I'd seriously consider here. Nice little village feel and some good houses, with beaches nearby. Poor train links though.

Avoid Walton (I live there now), Kirkdale and Anfield. Lots of unemployment, gangs of kids and generally run down. Pretty poor schools too. Orrell Park is ok.

The whole point is that they see no obligation to refute/disprove an argument from a hypocritical opponent whose only interest in said argument is to discredit someone anyway.

null,false,Patch86UK,,Labour Member,null,"&gt;In 1964, Labour was not just a party for the working class, but was also a party that was substantially comprised of the working class, with over 37 per cent of the MPs coming from manual occupational backgrounds. By 2010 this fell to just under 10 per cent.

In 1961, as much as 75% of the working population were in manual occupations, compared to 25% in 2000 (based off some quick googling; numbers not guaranteed accurate). That's a decline of two thirds. The Labour Party used to have 37% of its membership in manual occupations in 1964, and now it's 10%- a decline of only a little more than the decline in the general population. Perhaps it is a little more than the overall demographic figure, but considering party membership (across the board) is in decline, it's perhaps unsurprising that higher-income groups have clung on to the concept of party membership more than other groups.

Interesting too that his definition of ""working class"" is only to include manual occupations. This means that presumably his definition would exclude, say, supermarket attendants, call centre work or data-entry style admin work; the jobs which most lower-income people actually work these days. I wonder if you were to factor in the relative rise/decline of these jobs vs. manual work in the general population and in the Labour Party membership, would it come out as more or less a wash?

Third observation; parties count ""membership"" by different standards. When the Conservative Party say that they have 150,000 members (or whatever it's down to now), they include in that figure all people who have made a donation (however small) to the party over the last year, not just card-carrying members. Labour's 200,000 members only includes card-carrying members, not small donors or members of affiliates. If we counted membership the same way the Tories did, we would need to include all union members who are signed up to make the optional political contribution; I wonder what that would do to these headline figures? (Note: I'm glad we don't count these people as it would be dishonest and a misrepresentation.)

You said:

&gt; We could have moved Dembele back into CM, Eriksen to CAM and Chadli/Townsend on LW. 

I responded: 

&gt; Your main suggestion (at some point during the game - I assume at 2-2) is to move Dembele to CM, shift Eriksen to CAM and bring on a LW in place of Mason or Bentaleb (otherwise we're playing with 3 central midfielders). Chadli is obviously not 100% and it's not Townsend's natural position anyway - this might leave us in a worse position.

Chadli and Paulinho came on at 2-2 and they still scored. 

You then said:
&gt; We could even have moved Rose to LW or a straight swap with Davies in LB.

I responded: 
&gt; Your other suggestion was to shift Rose up and put on Davies. Who do you take out then? Dembele? We would lose even more of a presence in midfield if that's the case - extremely risky and we haven't seen them two play together often enough to even think it's a good idea.

To add to that, I'm not wholly sure swapping in Davies for Rose at that stage would have made the situation on the left any better anyway. 

And your final suggestion was: 
&gt; We could also have dropped our backline deeper to make it harder for Liverpool to run behind our backline.

I said: 

&gt; Last suggestion is to move the backline even further back, and then what? Liverpool are too talented going forward to allow them to keep possession and play so close to our box.

I never said we had already moved it back, before you're calling straw man arguments, make sure you actually read it first. 

Pochettino made adjustments at 2-2 when we still had a reasonable chance to either go out with the draw or win the game. Balotelli's goal came down to poor defensive work by Dier as he didn't cover his run properly. Chadli didn't cover Lallana's run on the left either so he was clear to provide the assist. Also Bentaleb and Rose didn't manage to deal with Sturridge on the left when he passed to Lallana.

I agree, Paulinho was poor - but I understood why he risked it. ",null,0,null,1423737032,null,0,false,0,coj49hz,null,t3_2vh0sf,null,t1_coj49hz,null,t1_coisfzh,null,null,null,1424547065,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

Basically, the woman meets her future husband when she is still a child, and meets him many times when he is at the age after he has met her in his own lifespan and married her, so when they meet for the first time in ''real time'' she knows him already, but he does not know her at all. Then they go through the process of forming their ''real time'' relationship with all the complications which his random time travel causes.

null,false,unexpecteditem,null,null,null,"Many thanks for your excellent explanation. You seem like a hot economist. 

However, as I often find with economics, the inner logic of your explanation doesn't *quite* hold together.  You have certainly mentioned borrowing from overseas, but the thrust of your answer, keeping things simple, for a simple fellow like me, is that government debt is owned by the B of E. No problem with that.

&gt; If we didn't pay back our self-loans we would be essentially saying there isn't any real value for this new money, so the economy would inflate until the total properly represents the real value again.

No problem with that. Very well put, I would say. But then you introduce the spectre of rising interest rates. 

&gt; The knock on effect would be rising interest rates, nobody would loan money at a decent rate to a country that pulled that move.

But, but, but...you  said the bank owns the debt and we borrow it from ourselves. Most of it. Let's forget foreign inward investment for a second. Surely, according to you, the central bank sets the interest rate. I thought they did, the base rate. 

BTW, i fully accept interest rates will rise, I just don't think your story quite covered why yet. 

Forgive me. I'm slow. What's wrong with this idea of the central bank setting interest rates. I'm assuming autarky for now because i grew up in the country on a farm. Go easy. People with their bonds come seeking their money back, the government just issues some more bonds. People start to doubt that the money will be returned therefore they expect a higher price for their risk and the rate must rise if the government is to raise capital. This I can accept, but look at the premise: people start to doubt that their investment will be repaid as promised. But why would they? The government can always issue more bonds. 

A little voice tells me we're going round in circles. Are we not? It is precisely the rising cost of money we are trying to explain. Now we have assumed that very condition in order to explain it. 

I do accept rising inflation according to the iron law of money. But rising interest rates seem not to follow logically yet until we relax my assumption of autarky. 

Wait. In a sense, it's the bond holders who own the debt. The central bank has accepted CONTINUED BELOW. ",null,0,null,1423737742,null,0,1423737922,0,coj4eh2,null,t3_2vk6ds,null,t1_coj4eh2,null,t1_coilf5n,null,null,null,1424547130,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

A leading member of the bar would probably take a 90% pay cut to become a judge. A successful senior junior barrister would probably still be looking at a 50% drop to become a District Judge (£104k pa).  When Jonathon Sumption QC became a Supreme Court judge he went from earning £8m for a trial to 200k per year. The drop in workload is hardly commensurate with the reduction in earnings.

Aston Villa Review: Episode 109 - Paul Lambert sacked
At what we can only hope was the end of a truly dismal run of form, Aston Villa sacked manager Paul Lambert on Wednesday evening. It was a decisive move that satisfied the almost universal wish of supporters, the final group's patience running out after Villa's lifeless defeat at Hull City on Tuesday.

In this bonus Aston Villa Review, Chris and Steve give their reactions to the news and discuss the ups and downs of Lambert's time at B6. What are the lasting memories, and what will his legacy be? More importantly, Villa must now act quickly to replace him.

My point being is that we are taught history in a very black and white way, when in fact it is very grey. The Easter Uprising is no exception. While they helped to get Irish Independence they also helped to create: the Black &amp; Tans, the Irish war of Independence, the Irish Civil war, and the Troubles.

All of the above might have been avoided if there wasn't an uprising. After all the Third Irish Home Rule Bill had passed back in 1914 but was delayed until after the war.

And such is our programming to be vigilant for racism/bigotry that people are simply not willing to believe that maybe, a large chunk of those ""moderates""  actually hold a wide range of views which most people would agree go against our own core principles.

There have been many studies which show just how bad this issue is, most of them get ignored as racist/bigoted.

The peacful majority is actually split into lots of different people, many of whom really do deserve the description and many who don't.

And obviously they already *do* have staff processing these claims. I'm not sure anyone's claiming it can't be done or isn't done.

What can't be done is for an expenses administrator to go searching every single train or plane ticket (beyond the odd random audit) to see if the traveller genuinely did take the cheapest option. The amount you'd save from the few odd ones that you did flag up would be far outweighed by the cost of employing that person.

If you were then shown a card that said ""Muslim"" or ""British Muslim"", and you said ""probably a terrorist"" then you'd be completely and absolutely wrong. This would be a false and bigoted generalisation.

Similarly, if you were shown a photo of Lutfur Rahman and you claimed ""may have orchestrated a postal vote fraud ..."" then that would be a cautiously reasonable statement to make given that there is some evidence and a trial in progress.

If you added ""... because he's a Muslim"" that would be just as wrong and bigoted as earlier.

And finding a correlation doesn't mean much unless you have some good reasoning behind it. You claim that the people involved in postal vote fraud were mostly Muslim. So what? Does it say somewhere in the Quran that vote fraud is a virtue? Has there been a fatwa commanding all believers to fiddle the elections? No. 

But if you started investigating and found, for example, an 'old boys network' of sorts colluding to rig the votes, that would be more interesting and could help explain why they may have attributes like religion and ethnicity in common.

£3m on expenses sounds a lot when presented in isolation. When you consider it as part of the entire organisation's expenditure, you realise it's just a cost of doing business.

I work in a tiny company and on average we spend £5k/head on travel each year getting to trade shows and meetings - cost of doing business, just like office space and paying the electric bill to keep the lights on.

Exeter turned over £305m in 2013-14, with salaries for it's 2200 staff making up ~50% of expenditure.

&gt;___Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor___ is a series of audiobooks produced by [Big Finish Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Finish_Productions) for [AudioGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AudioGo). They were released monthly through the first eleven months of 2013 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) television series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*.  The series - composed of eleven separate releases, one for each incarnation of the [Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) - is performed in the [third-person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_narrative) by an actor associated with each era of the show, with additional dialogue provided by a guest actor,   in a similar vein to Big Finish's own *The Companion Chronicles* series. The series is notable for being the first (and only) time Big Finish was allowed to directly feature current era (2005 onwards) characters, due to the collaboration with AudioGo.

The plans put forward at present envisage demolishing all but three of those, and building some huge modern glass-and-sandstone slabs either side of the main building.

Meanwhile the plans around West Register Street involve demolishing one B-listed building, and gutting another retaining just the façade; note that the also B-listed 4 and 5 St Andrew Square were demolished just recently because they were ""just façades""... it's not a good precedent to set.

What's the point of listing our best heritage buildings if it's meaningless and developers can just demolish them anyway to put up yet more sandstone and glass boxes?

Best thing to do is communicate what you want early and get things set up. Don't leave it to chance or try and push it last minute.

Also process will take around 6 - 8 weeks in my experience but I have heard of it taking a lot longer. It really depends on how good your solicitors and bank are.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"Yeah, and it happens everywhere. In a previous job my boss needed new workstations for his graphic designers. It was from his own budget, but he needed approval from 3 different people to break his ""self-sign"" spending cap of £500, and separate approval from IT because it was computing equipment.

Well one of the signatures he needed was away on sabbatical for 6 weeks and IT were dragging their heels and questioning whether he needed new kit anyway (his budget - he wasn't asking IT to pay for it - just to sign the form!).

He went and got his supplier to break the whole lot into sub-£500 invoices, so every workstation was invoiced 3 times - the basic tower; the graphics card; the monitor &amp; peripherals.

In the end, he put it through under an office supplies cost-code on 12 separate invoices, all self-approved because they were under £500 and not under an IT cost-code.

That wasn't theft, but it shows how people can manipulate the system - and he could have been buying computers off himself or from a shell company he owned outside the proper buying channels for personal profit.

That goes on everywhere - it's why forensic accountants exist. When bureaucracy stops people doing their jobs, people bypass it. It's no wonder the EU hasn't had it's accounts approved by the auditors in a decade - aside from the rampant corruption, I imagine the bureaucracy has led a lot of departments to ""just get on with it"", so nothing will have been bought out the right budget or under the proper cost-code.",null,0,null,1423744227,null,0,1423744446,0,coj5syg,null,t3_2viuws,null,t1_coj5syg,null,t1_coj5f99,null,null,null,1424547785,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

&gt;The __Tenth Doctor__ is an incarnation of [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)), the protagonist of the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) programme *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. He is played by [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) actor [David Tennant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant) in three series as well as nine specials. As with previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character has also appeared in other [*Doctor Who* spin-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_spin-offs). In the programme's narrative, [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) is a centuries-old [Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) alien from the planet [Gallifrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey) who [travels in time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel_in_fiction) in his [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS), frequently with [companions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)). When the Doctor is critically injured beyond medical repair, he can [regenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(Doctor_Who\)) his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change, and a new actor assumes the role. Tennant's portrayal of the Doctor is of an outwardly charismatic and charming adventurer whose likeable and easygoing attitude can quickly turn to righteous, even arrogant fury.

&gt;“We’re pretty confident about the pattern of behaviour by Lord Fink. Ed Miliband stood up to the banks, he stood up to Rupert Murdoch, he stood up to the energy companies and he’s certainly going to stand up to Lord Fink.”

&gt;Fink has insisted his account at the Swiss private banking arm of HSBC was entirely legitimate and opened purely because he was working in Switzerland. The UK tax authorities knew of the account and did not disapprove, he said in a statement.

So basically Ed Miliband is going to say ""it looks like you might be avoiding tax"". First of all looks like doesn't mean the same as you are. Secondly avoiding tax is fine. 

Milliband would need to say ""You are evading tax"" for it to be anything bad.

Arguing that other legislatures have different ratios [isn't an argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum). One could just as well argue that other legislatures might be wrong because they *don't* have the same ratio as Westminster.

Here's a link to the revision notes so you can pick whatever topic interests you http://www.tutor2u.net/economics/revision-notes/index.html 

Knowing the basics of supply and demand and how they're shown on a graph and how and why they change will help with a lot of stuff further on.

If you're mostly interested in the big stuff government deals with (top-down view, macroeconomics) then the A2 material will be more useful than AS.

Someone in /r/cirkeltrek noted that the biscuit they were using for this disgusting game kind of looked like our glorious Dutch *speculaas*, and rallied the Dutch forces (by means of a highly effective technique known as *opwillems*) against Germany. Before long, all posts on both /r/cirkeltrek and /r/kreiswichs were related to the war.

In the meanwhile, /r/schland (the Krauts are a bit odd in that they need two separate circlejerks; perhaps it's a psychological leftover from 1945-1989?) got embroiled in a similar war with /r/danmag. I don't know what started this, nor whether it started earlier or later than the Dutch-German war, but I intend to find out later. (It would be a shame if this war wasn't properly documented at some point, after all.)

I read something on /r/kreiswichs mentioning a ""two-front war"" against the Netherlands and Denmark, which made me aware that the Danes were also having Kraut trouble. I suggested an alliance between /r/cirkeltrek and /r/danmag, which got a lot of *opwillems*.

If you do not wish to attend a court date which you are not legally required to attend, you must instruct a solicitor to attend on your behalf if you do not want to face adverse consequences for your absence. 

The defendant in this case would have been sent his court date as well as a form to fill in if he wishes to plead guilty at an early stage. If you choose to plead guilty at an early stage, the sentence you receive is almost always a slightly reduced one. This is to speed up cases where an individual is clearly guilty. 
If you choose to go to court, you are basically denying the offence and leaving your sentence up to the discretion of the magistrates. if you then decide to not turn up to the court date that you yourself asked for, provide no evidence in your defence, you are clearly wasting the courts time. 

Discretion is a huge part of the English legal system, it allows the courts to take into account a vast range of circumstances and deliver verdicts and sentences based on those.

This turned into a dictatorship shortly after without any form of democracy (future elections stopped and severe repression of other parties).  If democracy had been able to continue then they would be been tempered.   Further, a house of lords equivalent in Germany would not have done anything to temper the authoritarian rule that followed (they would have disbanded the same as the Reichstag).

**The point is how they get into power**.  It's easily proven to be corrupt and there is no place for such corruption in modern society.  It's a bad remnant of a class society.

Let's think of productive ways to improve how they are selected as that is key problem in most peoples views.  Maybe 10 or 15 year terms or making party nominations more transparent, etc etc.  Most other democracies elect their 'higher' house so I see little reason for UK to be different.

I go to a university that is something like 33% international students, but I think I'm the only (or one of the only) North American student the school has seen in a while. So it's funny OP mentions but every time I talk to anyone at school, they react the same way: Asking me where I'm from first (as I was living close to the Canadian border for a while so I actually have a slight Canadian accent), why I came here, what life is like in the US, if schools and unis are like in the movies, sports, etc. And I know most of British Redditors dislike American accent but I've actually been commented on it a couple of people who like it. Maybe it's because I speak softly. (Not every American is obnoxiously loud, but I can see why many American tourists would be.)

It gets a little old to have to answer the same questions over and over, just like in OP's position, but it is what it is. This area I'm living in is far away from the more foreigner-populated places and I've yet to run into another American. 

It doesn't happen as often now, as you stated, since I tend to only hang out with the same classmates/friends and we hardly talk about the US anymore. The novelty has worn off.

But I guess my point is that it's kind of the same for many foreigners in most places of the world. Unfortunately for OP, a lot of accents from England is nice to the ears.

It is a bit different though because of the hyper vigilance against racism/bigotry.

The issues against same-sex marriage for example was wide open for criticism and we were able to have a fairly open debate about it.

In comparison the same cannot be said of muslim beliefs which are often treated with reverence and people are easily sidelined as being racist/bigots for criticising them.

I'm not setting out to stereotype people, actually I think I'm arguing against the ""peaceful majority"" stereotype which persists.

I think we should be able to criticise and challenge certain beliefs whilst accepting others. We can accept Muslims or anyone of any other faith as long as we understand that it's not their faith we are accepting. We are accepting them as individuals, what they choose to believe in is their choice but equally we should not be scared of challenging those beliefs when they are incompatible with our own.",null,0,null,1423749595,null,0,false,0,coj7i6e,null,t3_2vkthr,null,t1_coj7i6e,null,t1_coj7451,null,null,null,1424548609,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Not really. We are at a brink of deflation. This is the worst time EVER to take huge debt. 

Here's a very good article about it: http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/02/19/1776182/affordability-backwards/

&gt;In a low inflation world then, money illusion is that a mortgage is cheap when its initial payment is low. Without higher earnings growth, repaying the total debt will consume a far greater share of career earnings.

Quite often it will be cheaper to rebuild them then repair the old buildings within the strict guidelines a listed building requires.

My views are...

Individuals with accounts - Culpable. Bankrupt them and put them in jail.

HMRC - I can't tell if they're pragmatically trying to get as much as they can or if they're just inept.

Margaret Hodge - Grandstanding as usual.

HSBC Private Bank Switzerland - It's par for the course to have secrecy and to facilitate what you know is in the big picture tax evasion. However they weren't just following the pack they seem to have been innovating in ways to facilitate it.

HSBC - They owned the company so they are responsible for it's actions. Back then it was run as separate fiefdoms so there's some argument for saying the boss didn't know. The question is if he should have known? Is that why HSBC had the massive reorganisation, to dispose of these fiefdoms to bring everything under control?

I think the target should be the individuals and the newspapers are glossing over that. 

A couple of examples to think about to see if it helps.

* A company sells keylogging software, and tiny hidden cameras connected by wifi to hard drives. The company knows the stuff is used to spy on people. Is it ok for them to sell it?

* A company sets up next to the border. Over the border tobacco tax is huge. They set up selling cigarettes to people they know are taking them over the border to sell at car boot sales etc. 

I think the real distinction here is if the companies intentionally design their product for it. If the spy company starts advertising ""Catch your cheating partner!"" or ""Access their accounts so you can see where they've been spending"". Or if the shop starts selling bulk packages, or in a way it's easy to disguise them.

I think in HSBC's example what we're reading seems to indicate that they were cynically and deliberately targetting tax evasion customers not just knowing it was going on but being powerless to stop it.",null,0,null,1423750061,null,0,false,0,coj7onb,null,t3_2vn45j,null,t1_coj7onb,null,t1_coj5hvl,null,null,null,1424548693,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

In it's purest form justice would dictate that two different people would be punished the same for committing the same crime.

In this case I feel the discretionary powers of the British legal system have allowed factors not directly relating to *actual* crime to influence the outcome. As you've noted there were several opportunities for him to just admit it but he didn't. I think we're both in agreement that, that course of action lead to a harsher sentence. In layman's term they got pissy that he wasted their time so they ""threw the book at him"" as it were.

If he plead guilty earlier his sentence may/would have been slightly reduced. If he'd turned up at court his sentence would have been reduced. My problem is that these reductions in his sentence are about expedience, at the expense of actual justice - they've made no difference to the crime that was committed.

Equally increasing his sentence to ""make an example of him"" is in my opinion/interpretation of justice not right either. If they then chose to not make an example of the next person and they get a different/reduced punishment that would be a failure of justice. - by the same crime I don't necessarily mean just the same charge. I appreciate two people charged with speeding isn't necessarily the same crime, even if the recorded speeds are the same

I don't really believe in the concept of ""wasting the courts time"". It shouldn't be about personal feelings. My point isn't that somehow they have not followed the British legal process, its that the British legal process is quite far removed from the actual principles of justice on which it is based by allowing these factors to have influence.

I have to admit, when I read he ""didnt turn up"" I assumed, perhaps wrong, he did send a brief in some fashion just didn't attend himself / offer any evidence himself. But, as per the above, I don't really see his conduct during the process at any point as relevant - unless you accuse him of a separate crime around wasting the courts time/contempt of court, then his conduct actually IS the crime.

null,false,canard_glasgow,null,null,null,"&gt; ""Nicola Sturgeon versus the Austerions; part deux"".

&gt; As our diminutive superhero took on the might of the British State she faced the withering force of the evil ToryLabourtrons and their deadly allies the MediaMagnetos. Wham! Pow!

&gt; Actually the response of the UK political and media establishment to the First Minister's first pre-election foray south of the border yesterday was bemused indifference. The media seemed more interested in the comic possibilities presented by Harriet Harman's ""pink bus"" that is supposed to be taking the Labour message to the women of Britain.

&gt; The Scots are just ""at it"" again, said a weary Dan Hodges of the Daily Telegraph, a former Labourite who embodies the values of the austerity consensus. ""English voters are getting just a little tired of this,"" he told the BBC.

&gt; Ms Sturgeon's speech to UCL didn't have quite the range of Alex Salmond's famous Hugo Young lecture to the Guardian in 2011, when he called on the UK left to regard Scotland as a ""beacon of progressive politics"". But it was more specific and directly political. The stakes have risen since then: the SNP could be in coalition government in the UK in three months time.

&gt; Given that, she had a pretty benign reception for her lecture on how the UK should manage its economic affairs. The First Minister condemned current economic policy - Labour and Tory - for being ""morally unjustifiable and economically unsustainable"".

&gt; She wants to borrow a bit more and cut a bit less and insisted that by doing so - to the tune of £180 billion by 2020 - the UK Treasury could cut the debt faster through economic growth rather than though spending cuts. This is essentially what Labour's Ed Balls had been saying until around 2013, when Britain began to pull out of recession and unemployment started to fall, contrary to his expectations.

&gt;Since then the UK Labour party has moved in a markedly conservative fiscal direction. Ed Miliband's pitch to the UK at this election will be to ""balance the books"" - ie eliminate the deficit - by the end of the next parliament.

&gt;If that has a familiar ring to it, then that is because it is exactly what the Coalition said in 2010. It didn't happen. The deficit is lower, certainly, than it was - but Britain's debt pile has continued to increase. It now stands at £1.4 trillion, nearly 80 per cent of GDP.

&gt;The reason the debt hasn't been tamed is complex but it has a lot to do with the character of the economic recovery, which created jobs but but reduced wages and salaries. When even a Tory Prime Minister calls for pay increases, as David Cameron did this week, you know something weird is happening.

&gt; Families have had to borrow to maintain living standards because wages have been falling faster than at any time since the 1870s. Government revenues have been falling below expectations because people on low wages don't pay tax, they consume tax. The biggest increase in welfare payments now are to people who are in low-paid work.

&gt; All well and good for Ms Sturgeon to point this out, but then it gets a bit sticky. For there is a certain irony in the First Minister lecturing Westminster on deficit financing when the Scottish Government has been commending itself for ""balancing the books"" in Scotland.

&gt;  She did it again in her speech to UCL yesterday. ""Fiscal discipline is good for governments"" she told her audience of academics and politicians. Admittedly, the Scottish Government say they've been making a virtue out of necessity and that they would like more borrowing powers than are on offer. But the the SNP has been adept at talking left while acting conservative - at least in fiscal terms.

&gt; The council tax freeze, for example, has been criticised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation for creating at local level precisely the austerity that Nicola Sturgeon condemns at UK level. The SNP insist keeping council tax low benefits less well off Scots, but less well off Scots are mostly exempt from council tax anyway.

&gt; The real reason for the freeze - and the reason Labour criticise it but never quite get round to opposing it - is that it is extremely popular with voters, especially homeowners. No one wants to mention increased taxation, which is a key element of ""fiscal discipline"", because it is electorally toxic.

&gt;  But the Scottish Government have to be careful not to look like fiscal hypocrites. Ms Sturgeon's anti-austerity philosophy must recognise the possibility taxes could and should increase. She agrees wealth distribution has become grossly unbalanced in most large developed economies over the last 30 years, and is becoming more and more unbalanced.

&gt; Inequality feeds on itself, as the economist Thomas Piketty observed: the more you have, the more you get. The only way to reverse this trend is through redistribution at some level.

&gt; Jim Murphy says the First Minister should make a start in her own patch by increasing taxes on the rich - the 16,000 Scots who earn more than £150,000 a year. Slap a 50p tax on them. The Scottish Government is very wary of doing this in case the rich individuals who are liable hop over the border and avoid paying any tax at all to the Scottish exchequer.

&gt; But the trouble is that the same argument is used by the Conservatives in England about the 50p top rate for the UK as a whole. They say that businesspeople either avoid it, with the help of PriceWaterhouseCooper and HSBC, or they leave the country taking their businesses with them.

&gt;Now, obviously it is easier to hop over to England than it is to hop over to Monaco or Liechtenstein. Nevertheless, the essential argument is the same: that with globalisation, wealth taxes are an inefficient way of raising revenue. It has to start lower down the income scale.

&gt; Mr Murphy knows this perfectly well, but why should he worry since he isn't going to be in government for the foreseeable future. But hard choices could arise very soon for the Scottish Government after the general election if the Tories continue in power at Westminster.

&gt; Will Ms Sturgeon's anti-austerity message come back to haunt her? Will she find she has to use the new powers of Holyrood to raise income tax in Scotland to combat austerity if there is another Conservative-led coalition in Westminster?

&gt;Presumably, she's hoping it will never happen; that she will join an anti-austerity coalition in Westminster with Labour after May. Certainly, there was no indication yesterday from senior Labour figures in London that they would rule out a deal with the SNP in the way Labourites in Scotland like Labour Hame's Duncan Hotershall have been urging

&gt;Labour's Shadow Leader of the House, Angela Eagle, on the BBC's Daily Politics show, didn't seem too concerned when the presenter Andrew Neil suggested she was speaking the same anti-austerity language as the SNP and that a coalition already looked a done deal.

&gt;Realpolitik dictates that if Labour seriously want to enter government they must contemplate a possible alliance with the SNP against the Coalition austerions. It's simple arithmetic. So, let the final conflict commence! Just don't mention the ""T"" word.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"Hmmm, difficult to tell. That sounds like the sort of study that could be very easily biased by who you talk to.

Some people are going to go as fast as they can, but the gearing on a lot of cars means they'll quite happily cruise at 80-85 (and stop in a fraction of the specified distance in the Highway Code).

Drivers of those cars wouldn't necessarily drive much quicker if the limits were raised.

By way of example, my parent's Volvo will cruise quite comfortably at 75-80 in 6th gear. And yet it doesn't much like being pushed past 100 (which they discovered when they drove to, ah, Germany on the autobahns, where it's totally legal... yes.). There are lots of people in that sort of position who would take advantage of higher speed limits without going overboard.

I don't dispute there are plenty however that would take it as permission to do 90-100, but many of them will do that *anyway* if their car is capable of it.

Given that it seems like an increasing proportion of Britain's motorways are covered in average speed check cameras anyway, it wouldn't be an inappropriate move to raise the limit to 80 if it's going to be permanently enforced by blanket camera coverage anyway...


Also, 100 is a perfectly safe speed if you maintain a proper braking distance with the car in front. If you're a serial tailgater then obviously no, you're going to run out of reaction time. But if you're a serial tailgater, then your use of speed is only one of a much longer list of shortcomings you possess as a driver.",null,0,null,1423754027,null,0,1423781561,0,coj9h38,null,t3_2vknnh,null,t1_coj9h38,null,t1_coj280u,null,null,null,1424549528,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

One road I drive regularly has a camera on a steep downhill section. It's steep enough that if you stick it in second and rely on engine braking, you'll still do 35, and the engine really makes unpleasant noises if you drop down to in first.

You're on engine *and* brakes, which tells you how steep it is.

Now I get why it's there - precisely to stop people speeding down into the village.

But trying to maintain 25mph and stop your car creeping over 30 very definitely distracts from the zebra crossing and multiple junctions immediately after the camera because you're looking at your speedo not the road (and trying not to jab the brake so hard the person behind you runs into you - because they're looking at their speedo - not my brake lights!)

It would honestly be far safer to do 35 but be able to properly scan the pavements and junctions for pedestrians and other vehicles.

Visibility of the crossing is - ironically - obscured by the signage telling you to drive safely through the village, but that's not the fault of the speed limit - rather that of the dipshit who thought it was a good idea to obscure a pedestrian crossing until you're practically on top of it.


On the flip side, I recently drove a car with cruise control for the first time, and after getting used to the initially unnerving sensation of taking your foot off the throttle and the car *not* slowing down it was an utter joy to drive through contraflows and average speed check areas fully focused on the road and not worrying about whether I'm doing 52 or 48.

Moreover a learner driver can't go on a motorway. I was fortunate in that I had to drive down dual carriageway to get to the town where I took my test - motorways were an easy step because they were just like dual carriageways with an extra lane. 70mph, slip roads - quite comfortable with them.

But I know test centres with no dual carriageway near them, where you won't get above 50 on the rural A-roads surrounding them either during lessons or on test.

2.  Inheritance tax applies only when assets total more than £325,000.  You received the first £325,000 tax free and everything above that is taxed at 40% (or 36% if 10% of total assests is donated to charity).  e.g.  Mr Smiths father dies leaving a total asset value £400,000  to his Son.  His Son receives £325,000 of the assets tax free.  The remaining £75,000 is split with the government receiving 40% i.e. £30,000 and the son receiving £45,000.

3.  Yes the ex-spouse would if the child inherited the funds during the marriage.  I don't believe they would be entitled to the funds if the child inherited the money after the divorce, since divorce funds only apply to those gained whilst being married.  However the divorced party may sue simply to obtain a settlement  i.e. cheaper to settle than to go through court again.  Talk to a divorce lawyer if this is a legitimate concern. 

4.  If you wanted to avoid the scenario of the ex-spouse having a right to inherited funds then they would have to agree to a pre-nup stating they forfeit all rights to any inherited wealth.  Again lawyer needed here.

5.  My family have just been with dealing with the tax man after a relative died, who's wealth was tied up in property.  Basically a bill was sent out to the tune of 40% of the value of the properties (minus the first £325,000) by the government.  This also had a deadline on it stating that if the account wasn't settled by x date then fines would be levied.  It resulted in the properties being immediately put on the market as nobody had the liquid capital to pay the tax bill.

Child sexual exploitation has to deal with victims who are uncooperative - who will run away, who hate the police who are supposedly trying to help them and who will refuse to testify against their ""boyfriend"".

From a police perspective, there is a simplicity to burglaries and muggings - the victim is not going to blame you for putting the perpetrator in prison, nor are they going to fight to prevent you doing so.

So it's really not that incomprehensible that some cops should think ""screw this, we're not helping them if they won't help themselves"".

They love the easily digestible stuff about soccer.  Messi and Rondaldo - yeah no shit their stats are mind-blowing, they're the best players of their generation by about a billion degrees.  Zlatan - yes he's very funny but how do you feel about the fact many think he's an overrated poacher who can't handle the European stage or big games?  Chelsea - oh wow, what a team to pick.  How in the world did you happen to come across one of the most successful teams of the modern Prem era?  Guys, Neymar is pretty good - check out this gif.

I'm being a bit harsh, but the hypocrisy is mind-blowing.  America LOVES underdogs - unless you're a fan, it is kind of the culture to root for teams playing against the Yankees, Patriots, Ohio State (college football), Heat, etc.  Yet for soccer, the logic seems to be if you're not rooting for the top 4, what's the point?  It's more than gloryhunting - it's some sort of weird sports FOMO.

I remember seeing an article a while back that showed a bunch of what I think was Bolton supporters in Texas. To me, THAT'S soccer fandom.  Not even a PL but their team is their team.  I think some were expats (obviously), but I thought it was so cool.  Yet you would never ever see that kind of mindset on r/soccer.

But my company (and yours!) pays 20% tax on its profits, so the reduced tax on dividends makes sense (as it has already been taxed once).

There's nothing wrong or immoral about it. Tax avoidance is simply operating your accounting in such a way that you *legally* pay the minimum tax. 

If you *illegally* found a way of paying less tax, then of course you would expect to be prosecuted, and that would be tax *evasion*.

Unfortunately, most of the permanently-angry student warriors on Reddit have not the faintest idea about how the UK business economy works, and equate avoidance with evasion.

Other forms of tax avoidance:

* Buying a sandwich in Costa to take-away, and then eating it in the shop.

* Buying a nearly-new car instead of a brand new one.

* Buying your cigarettes/alchohol while you are on holiday abroad.

* Buying concentrated orange juice because it is cheaper than freshly squeezed orange juice

* Downloading any chargeable music/film/software that you don't pay for (actually I guess that one is just stealing ...)

Now that I've said that, here are the realities, in my opinion: he has not proven himself in Europe just yet. He has only thus far played the likes of AEL Limassol, Besiktas, Tripoli, and Partizan outside of Britain. Well, don't hold me to that because I don't feel like looking up if he actually played in those games, but my point stands: his European sample is small and against teams not considered ""world-beaters"". I think it's a safe assumption that he doesn't move to another ""big"" league because he isn't a star on the continent yet. 

Once you've ruled out a transfer abroad, you have to look at his chances of moving intra-league, which are slim: he's 21, English, and currently enjoying terrific form. He had immense games against ""top"" sides and hasn't had a ""bad"" game since, well, I don't remember because it's been so long. Even IF Levy were willing to do intra-league business, I believe the English premium, especially for a young starlet proving himself, would beg AT LEAST a ballpark figure of what Lukaku went for.

There are certainly some people who think that any contractor operating through a limited company is tax dodging scum - personally I'm not one of them.  

A limited company is a perfectly legitimate vehicle to use for a single person, and has benefits beyond saving you tax in providing a separation of business and personal assets and liabilities.  There are some special rules in place aimed at preventing serious abuse (Google IR35) which if anything go too far, and I recognise that working for yourself, with or without a company, is a fundamentally different thing to being employed and it is reasonable that it has a different tax treatment.

Where it gets dicey is in some of the more ""aggressive"" tax avoidance schemes.  These tend to involve creating elaborate legal fictions which exist solely to generate a tax saving. This is the sort of stuff which, IMO, is taking the piss.  They tend to arise because the tax system is complicated with all sorts of reliefs and special rules in place which are intended to encourage certain groups and behaviours but which are also ripe for ""creative interpretations"".

At no level of football do you not tell a player who he's coming on for. It's literally the first thing you tell them (you're going on like for like for so and so or joining so and so up front and this players coming out).

If he didn't tell him  that Sturridge was coming off and he knew he was going on up front, than he'd be going on thinking he was playing alongside Sturridge and not in there alone. It just doesn't happen. If an u12 manager did that at youth level, the kid would ask him who he's going on for otherwise he doesn't know tactically what he's doing - If he thought Sturridge was staying on then he wouldn't have known he was alone through the middle which is as good as saying 'go on up front there somewhere'

Trouble is that’s really hard to orchestrate – smoking is a) partly social and b) a gas based activity. Confining its effects to a very local area can be tricky. 

Given the boundaries of where you can and can’t smoke – smokers usually go no further than those limits if they’re based in one place (i.e. just outside a doorway or gate or whatever entrance way that everyone uses). 

This inevitably means a run in between smokers and non-smokers as the non-smokers negotiate whatever entrance has smokers near it.  

I too dislike smoking and don’t support a complete ban, but walking through Birmingham city centre and seeing the litter from discarded cigarettes… or walking out of New Street train station into a wall of people smoking… well it is unpleasant. No nice way of saying it. 

As far as banning it in cars with children goes – I’m completely in favour. They (the children) can’t help their situation and it’s both unfair and unhealthy to put children in that environment. If you need to smoke whilst driving, find a place to stop and have a quick fag. Simple.

Again. Just saying I don't understand doesn't change a damn thing. Can you honestly not see the illogical nature of what you are saying in this?

&gt;To a lay person, it seems like a rational idea to equate privatisation with better service. 

Lol. Are you fucking real right now? What kind of stuck-up argument is this? 'Oh my dear you are simply not educated enough to understand my intellect!'.

&gt;a private business exists, solely to please investors and shareholders and nobody else at the end of the day.

This doesn't make sense. At all. There is no business in this world that does not take into account customer happiness. What are you saying is completely illogical. I can 't put it more simply. A business's money comes from the customer and it is a voluntary exchange in a free market; if it is voluntary, then there is a choice. If there is a choice, then the choice is going to be the one in which the customer will end up being the happiest with. Am I saying it's going to be perfect? No. What system is? If every exchange could be isolated perfectly with no externalities then we would have found our system with universal agreement on it. But are you honestly saying that a public system doesn't have a problem with externalities?

&gt;But, and this is a big but, the crucial thing is, they exist whilst breaking even.

What is 'breaking even'? Are you saying that a hospital that manages to 'break even' with its budget should be commended, irrespective of the quality of its service? How is that a good ethic to have?

&gt;In most cases traditionally anyway, hospitals were run by people with patient care at heart.

What rule says this? Is there any evidence for this? Even if it was true, then what makes you say a private hospital doesn't do the same? Increased quality of patient care = more loyal customers = the hospital getting a good name for itself = more profit. You're just making me repeat myself, I already spent a good deal of words on this in my last comment.

&gt;Private firms do not carry the same duty of care; they only want to maximise profit.

Again, I literally spent a good paragraph explaining why this is a good thing. Are you sure you are actually reading my comments?

&gt;If they employ a manager for example from a medical field but they only break even they will replace him/her with someone in a better financial understanding but without the prior desire to ensure healthy citizens and standards of care will likely drop.

A manager with a better financial understanding means more money for the employees working on patients and more money available for overall services. Thus, we get better care. You can have the best intentions in the world as a manager and it will amount to nothing unless you have the knowledge of proper management.

Before I continue, you are still lingering on this principle that you have ingrained in you that it is in a private hospitals best interests to decrease quality of care in order to make a profit. You really either don't understand this or you really don't want to understand it.

&gt;Private firms do not carry the same duty of care; they only want to maximise profit

This is something you keep repeating, with no elaboration. How would a private hospital make money? Well it's quite simple. Provide a service of care for patients that is profitable. So what does it mean when a private hospital is profitable. Does it mean, like you said, that the evil managers are decreasing hospital care expenditure in order to gain a 'quick fix of money'? Well what would that do to the hospital? Well they definitely would gain a 'quick fix of money'; it wouldn't be incredible amounts, but it would be a nice amount. So... Now what? You've now decreased the quality of healthcare by a significant amount; aren't your customers going to notice? Of course they are. Do they have a choice of where to go? Of course they do; in a free market system there will nearly always be a hospital competing with multiple other hospitals. And if there isn't? Well then this hospital that just decreased its expenditure by a significant amount just opened up the market to any rich businessmen (which there will always be a supply of in a market system) who sees a gap in the market; a better hospital than the old one. So now there is a businessman with the incentive to invest in a new hospital that is better than the old one, because the old one just alienated its customer base. What will the old hospital do? Will it cut even further? For more quick influxes of money? Well no, because that didn't work so well last time. It now also has an incentive to produce a better quality of service than the hospital before. Cutting will also hurt its employees, who just received a cut to their pay checks. Hardly going to give an incentive to the employees to stay at that hospital, is it? So maybe the doctors will be attracted by this new hospital who actually pays their employees well? Or maybe they will go on strike with their unions? (Unions are essential in a free market economy, the right for people to voluntarily associate and group together has nothing coercive about it; unless they threaten the bosses with force/violence.) So you can see how cutting expenditure and decreasing quality of care is not a simple and rational choice for the managers, like you seem to think it is.

&gt;It might not be what you want to hear and you may not agree but it's the truth all the same.

What's with all the phrases straight out of a high school debating club? It just sounds laughable. It doesn't even make logical sense.

&gt;What is lunacy is the idea that you can construct potentially billions of pounds worth of buildings and equipment, near enough to each other to facilitate competition and expect it to go ok.

Will it always go ok? No. But are you saying a government planned hospital will always go ok? You're kidding me?

Let me ask you, who is going to make the better decisions with 'potentially billions of pounds worth of buildings and equipment'? A businessman using his own money, or a government body who, when things go wrong, simply gets a bigger budget or increases taxes to make up for potential/real losses? 

&gt;This is where your ""humanists"" come from. When money doesn't matter, the next thing most people in private healthcare will default to is patient care. Which should be the first thing on the list, every single time.

I'm really not getting into where 'humanists' come from because you're way off the mark anyway. The fact of the matter is, money does matter in a public hospital. Why do you think they have to pay people? Why do you think the government has to tax people? They need money. Saying anything else is just plain stupid, and shows the mind of someone in complete denial. Are you telling me that the government could hire an entire workforce for free and that we could have a government without taxes because it is a collection of humanists who 'work for the common good'? .....Are you trolling? You can't honestly believe this, right?

&gt;If you recieve shitty care from a hospital, you can complain, you can sue and people win both ways.

Sure, you can sue the NHS. But what does that do? The government still isn't going to shut the hospital down because there would be a public outcry. It will simply subsidise the cost of the fee from the courts; because tax is non-negotiable, people can not simply not pay taxes; otherwise they are arrested. Will there be some sort of government inquiry? Maybe. Will it actually have an effect on services? Probably not. It could. But it's nowhere near the improvement rate that comes from the incentive of profit; and if you want a refresh on why, go back and read what I said about arbitrary guidelines. For example, the government inquiry might just put the death rate down to a maximum of 30.

&gt;Your healthcare is cheaper (ie, National Insurance) than it would be under a private system (as evidenced by higher insurance costs in the US)

You do realise using the US as an example of private healthcare is insanely misinformed? Did you know that the US government subsidises healthcare per capita vastly more than we do, even before Obamacare was implemented? The American healthcare system is NOT a free market.

&gt;and we have systems where complaints are heeded and are almost certainly taken into account.

Where's the evidence for this? Have you read the news in the past few years?

http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/NHS-chiefs-won-t-admit-failings-ndash-MP/story-26014466-detail/story.html

You can make inquiries all you want, what is important is results. Just saying that you are 'listening to complaints' means absolutely nothing.

&gt;Not because profit is involved but because it's run as a service.

I don't even know. What is a service? What is attached to it that makes you think that because something is called a 'service', that suddenly it becomes more open and takes into account more complaints?

Now I'm never going to argue that private healthcare is perfect (which I have to keep repeating to you), because me simply stating something like 'Public healthcare fails because it is run for service while private healthcare is good because it runs for profit' is not enough and just sounds childish. It's reasoning I keep hearing you spout and it's really hard to engage in any proper debate with it.

&gt;As much as you strive to deny it, a private system wouldn't help for tonnes of reasons I've already explained and I'm not going to beat a dead cat.

You didn't actually explain anything. You just said 'They are run for profit therefore they are evil' over and over again without elaborating.

&gt;You think two hospitals, side by side is an easy feat to achieve?

Who said anything about it being easy? Whether it is easy is down to how big the potential profit is (which is heavily linked to how much improvement can be made, which I explained further back).

&gt;First of all, they are more expensive than almost any other permanent structure.

Ok first, there are most certainly more expensive private investments that can be made for what I would call more trivial pursuits. Secondly, yes, they are still expensive investments; that's why rich businessmen invest in it and not middle-class family businessmen.

&gt;You cannot simply erect a hospital without any form of financial aid,

There are plenty of people with the capital to invest safely in a hospital, that's how private hospitals exist. If they weren't profitable for investors then they would not exist.

&gt; this creates debt causing profit driven business.

Borrowing huge amounts of wealth for short term investments? What huge organisation does this? Who does this in order to pander to masses? Where have I heard this before? You also yet again bring up being profit-driven as being a negative; which I've already discussed.

&gt;This is simple economics

Please don't call this reasoning simple economics. It's embarrassing. It's more along the lines of the reasoning that you shouldn't walk into the path of a fast car because it will kill you. 

&gt;One is government hence why surprise surprise, hospitals are all government owned and largely, run. The second type of group with the kind of money are conglomerates, who have no interest because healthcare is more often than not a loss leading service in the public sector. Why? Because health is put above money. That is the way it should be. Privatise it and you may save money, but with that, patient standards come down as well.

There you go again, with the circular reasoning. 'They put health above profit because I say they do'. I've already addressed all this in my previous paragraphs.

&gt;What is lunacy is the idea that you can construct potentially billions of pounds worth of buildings and equipment, near enough to each other to facilitate competition and expect it to go ok.

But you trust the government (really a made of thing, since the government is composed of people who are paid a salary) to do the same thing without any incentive because there is no competition? You're making assumptions out of nothing. Can you actually explain why it would not work? Why is it we can have the same thing with banks? Or supermarkets? Or sellers of high value commodities? Or high value production facilities? There are lots of examples of private companies being in close proximity. There is no economic rule against it.

&gt;I don't think you understand just how much expensive equipment a hospital contains. I'm talking millions of pounds worth of expensive analytical equipment in a single department. Larger hospitals contain upwards of tens of departments and a speciality which will probably increase capital costs by around 5x for the best around.

Ok. You can stop being patronising. I've done work experience in a hospital. I know what they are like.

&gt;taffing is also an issue, hospitals employ huge numbers of nurses, doctors, consultants, analysts, sometimes researchers, lab technicians, cleaners, cafe workers. It's a gargantuan job building and employing these people.

Yeah they do. What's your point? Again you're not actually stating anything that a private company can't do. Just look at any skyscraper complex owned by a company. Are you telling me that skyscrapers can only be made and owned by governments because they require a lot of planning?

&gt;A natural monopoly is the only sensible way to keep costs at a minimum for all involved.

That... Doesn't make any sense. Whatsoever. Firstly, what is 'natural' about it? The reason NHS hospitals exist is because they are paid by the government, which is protected by the police force who have weaponry. Is that natural?...

Secondly. How does a monopoly keep costs down? That makes absolutely no sense. The problem with monopolies is THE EXACT OPPOSITE. Any form of monopoly is bad for nearly everyone; whether it be public or private; because they have absolutely 0 competitors. Every single economist in the world agrees with this; communist or libertarian; social democrat or conservative.

&gt;What I'm saying in a nutshell is this, socialised medicine doesn't aim to reduce choice

Yes it does. How can a company enter the market when there is already someone there being supported by the government? This is a point you shouldn't even be arguing; even most hard-line NHS supports agree that the NHS limits choice.

&gt;What isn't the same is his manager's motivations or his manager's or his manager's. Patient health should be the number one reason a hospital exists, on every single occasion and profit should never be a consideration.

Again with the assumption that profit =/= patient care?... Seriously? It's like a broken record.

&gt;A corporate monopoly will bleed individuals clean. 

A corporate monopoly is bad; what's your point? I already addressed how monopolies arise.

&gt;Look at internet in the US. Some places only receive one choice of internet provider. Those people get screwed to high heaven with high fees and low service value. Providers lie, bribe and cheat their way to making a profit, spending vast amounts of money on these ""waste-inducing"" business practises because they have no competition to chase them. 

Good news. You should read about the FCC. An example of government organisations fucking up markets.

&gt;If you give people a choice where one choice is morally favourable but personally detrimental and the other is personally favourable but morally detrimental, most people will pick the latter because it's easier, less effort and more often than not, more personally profitable either through money or lack of responsibility. Especially when they are not accountable for the consequences.

This is too complicated and does not provide reason for average human action. Humans, when given a choice, pick the one which maximises their perceived happiness. Happiness is objective; which is why some people volunteer; because they get happiness out of it.

&gt;That's just crass.

If it's so crass then explain to me why it isn't a monopoly; because I just did a few paragraphs ago.

&gt;For the record, I meant corporate monopolies who bought their way to market domination

As opposed to the government, who imposes its will through the policing system. 

&gt; not natural, regulated and government ordered monopolies like the NHS.

You can use those adjectives all you want, but there is no evidence to show that regulation provides beneficial results.

&gt;The whole thing about supermarkets was an example and that alone it wasn't intended to be a demonstration of real life in any capacity, though the ideas about marketing and advertising are true. If you don't believe me, look it up. 

It was a pretty well laid out example, and it had pretty simple principles. Don't just brush it off because you don't like what it implied. Also. Look what up? Why can't you show me why you disagree? Like I did with your supermarket example.

&gt;But let's think long term. What will happen if one screws up badly? They'll go bust.

If it screwed up to the point that it goes bust then perhaps it shouldn't deserve to provide an important service to people. You have to ask yourself what makes companies go under. It's mostly either bad decisions on the hand of the company or some form of government intervention, or a combination. If you want examples of government intervention making companies go under, look no further than The Great Depression. The best way to stop companies going bust is to have a system in place which allows them to make the best decisions possible in the clearest view.

&gt;Oh dear, now we have one hospital and no competition.

Well yeah. If we had a total of one rich person in the world and a total of one hospital in the world. Saying that no one could step in later is just ridiculous. 

&gt;Now we have a problem. No hospitals for 40 or 50 miles. All emergencies in the area need to come here because an ambulance can't transport a heart attack patient in critical condition too far before they drop. We have a problem because now this hospital has around say, 250,000 patients to cater for but only room for a third of that maximum. A&amp;E waiting times are going through the roof because of it.

Thank you for allowing me to illustrate a point. Yes. We do have a serious problem. Do you know what this problem just created? Demand. A whole host of demand. Outside businessmen are now drooling over the creation of a lucrative new market; and they will jump at the chance to get a piece.

&gt;Shareholders are happy because they have 250,000 lots of private insurance money rolling in every year

You think shareholders are happy that they are only getting a fraction of the potential money on the market? Like I said earlier, no one ever says 'enough is enough'. The shareholders will want the company to expand its labour force and assets in order to provide a bigger service for a bigger customer base. Why? Because it's going to be profitable.  

&gt;If you don't believe anything I've said then please pick up an economics textbook and just read about it.

&gt;With different nationalities attending our schools we will ensure meals appeal to a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and tastes. We are aware that some of the pupils have special diet needs such as vegetarian or religious dietary requirements. Some pupils have special needs and some emotional and behavioural problems which the team will be advised of.

&gt;Our primary objective for catering within Islington is to provide pupils, staff and visitors with a choice of homemade, nutritious and well balanced meals. Menus will reflect the requirements and tastes of pupils and staff and will be continually monitored to ensure the menu choices encourage the highest levels of uptake.

&gt;A three week menu cycle will be changed seasonally, our Development Chef consults with your schools and Council.

&gt;We will ensure red meat is available at least twice a week and fish at least once a week which will include an oily fish. Vegetarian protein options will include beans and pulses an there will always be a choice of two bread/cereals or potato choices. Wherever possible sauces and dressings are made with low fat ingredients and cooking oil and salt is used to a minimum. Alternative low fat fillings will be available for sandwiches and jacket potatoes and low fat yoghurt and desserts are and skimmed milk for cereals.

&gt;Freshly cut fruit and low fat fruit yoghurt will be available everyday as an alternative to the daily homemade dessert, a treat once in a while such as ice cream on a Friday helps to add a bit of fun into school meals for pupils. Although a bowl of cherries or strawberries arranged nicely can sometimes appeal more to the younger children as a treat and we will always offer this as an alternative.

Tax avoidance is finding loopholes in the law to avoid paying tax you should.  This system is set up specifically for you to do this, so it is not tax avoidance (just like taking your personal allowance isn't tax avoidance, pensions aren't tax avoidance and ISAs aren't tax avoidance).

I've borrowed this from another thread and as written by /u/chrisjd:

This is also worth repeating, HMRCs definition of tax avoidance:

&gt; Tax avoidance is bending the rules of the tax system to gain a tax advantage that 
Parliament never intended. It often involves contrived, artificial transactions that serve little 
or no commercial purpose other than to produce a tax advantage. It involves operating 
within the letter but not the spirit of the law.

&gt; Tax avoidance is not the same as legitimate tax planning. Legitimate tax planning involves 
using tax reliefs for the purpose for which they were intended. For example, claiming tax 
relief on capital investment, saving in a tax-exempt ISA or saving for retirement by making 
contributions to a pension scheme are all legitimate forms of tax planning.

That might be putting money into an ISA (interest earned here isn't taxed), putting money into a pension fund (ditto) or just choosing to operate in the UK rather than France because the corporate tax rate is lower.


Tax evasion is when actually do something illegal. A good example is under reporting your profits (i.e. lying). Since tax will be a % of your profits pretending you have lower profits will mean your tax bill is lower. See also, charging personal expenses through the company and not accounting for that when you calculate the tax bill.


*Aggressive* tax avoidance is the grey area. This is (basically) when you have an arrangement that lowers your tax bill but that arrangement *only exists* to lower your tax bill.

Example:

Dogsafe Ltd exists in the UK and sells dogs and safes. It does alright, sales of £50,000 a year, costs of £25,000 a year, profit before interest of £25,000. Tax at 20% would be £5,000 a year.

But Dogsafe Ltd is owned by an Irish parent company called Dogsafe O'Malley Ltd. Dogsafe O'Malley Ltd a loaned an enormous amount of money to Dogsafe Ltd at a crippling interest rate so every year Dogsafe Ltd pays Dogsafe O'Malley Ltd £25,000 in interest charges.


Dogsafe Ltd now doesn't make any profit and so doesn't pay any tax. Dogsafe O'Malley Ltd earns £25,000 in interest and pays 11% tax to the Irish tax authority, £2,750. 


Unless there's some business reason (i.e. not tax) for this loan, this probably crosses the line form aggressive tax avoidance to tax evasion.


Obviously this is a very simple example. There are various checks and balances to stop this kind of thing but it works as an example.",null,0,null,1423762639,null,0,false,0,cojee6r,null,t3_2vnmuy,null,t1_cojee6r,null,t3_2vnmuy,null,null,null,1424551895,null,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6,null

I think we've found where your status on sausages lie... /s

But really, what's the point in not giving kids a choice in what they eat? Sod the parents, unless that kid is actually ALLERGIC to something then maybe a little bit of grace when it comes to kids trying new things and learning for themselves, which you know is generally what happens in schools nowadays, and actually giving them the opportunity to make up their own mind?


""BUT THEY'RE JUST KIDS!"" I hear you cry. Yes, they are just kids, and they shouldn't be forced into doing something just because the previous generation tell them to. This is where the evolution breaks down in society and which is why multiculturalism doesn't work and will never work.

I genuinely feel that having religious based schools is harmful to society and has been proven by the amount of bull we have to put up with involving the ""white guilt"" and how we generally pussyfoot around the whole subject because we don't want to be called or labelled as a racist.

If you put your kids in school in the UK, expect them to be given a British education with British teachings, using the English language as a primary language and teaching French/Spanish/German like what happens with the rest of us. It's an all round education. Not a one sided piece of propaganda just because someone believes in a flying monkey-fairy from never never land which promises everything when you die if you live the way it wants you to, rather than just rotting, like we all do*.

Thousands of soldiers fight in wars and get bugger all from our state after they leave (maybe a measly pension but probaly fuck all support for the PTSD the war gives them).

The thing about Lucas is that he gets injured a lot, and past injuries have robbed him of some of his ability. He's crucial for us right now, had he played on Tuesday night we'd have probably kept a clean sheet. But it's not his unique talents that we need, we've just needed to play a dedicated DM to protect the back line. We're very light in that regard, since we have a lot of players who can play makeshift DM (Can, Allen) and some who get forced there despite not really being good at the role (Gerrard, Hendo). I'd like to see us spend big on a DM in the summer, like how we think of Lallana as our main purchase last summer.

When I was younger we all used to mess about at the local park. The ""travelling community"" had just moved in near the place, so of course they'd do the same as a bunch of kids and hang out at a park.

One night we were there, there was barbie dolls scattered throughout the place. All the park homies decided it'd be a swell idea to fuck these barbie dolls up. In our crazed delinquint minds this was a good idea. They were burnt, broken and thrown away.

So the next day, we decided we'd spend our day at the park, again. So we all rock up on our bikes and guess who's there. The ""travelers"". Of course I was prime suspect for whatever reason, so the ""head traveler"" or gypsy king, came up to me, started throwing out threats and telling me to fight him. What chance would a 13 year old stand against a 20 year old gypsy? The barbie dolls belonged to the gypsy offspring, and apparently they owned the park and all that was in it so it was totally my fault for mutilating barbie. 

Realizing my life was in danger, I just stood there. Wondering what the fuck is going on. But luckily, the local drug dealer from that area came in and told the ""traveler"" to leave me alone because I was 13 and ""didn't know any better"".

So I owe my life to a drug dealer. 

Oh and another story of my encounters with the traveling community; 

So it was coming round to Halloween. We all know what this means. Fireworks. Trying to find something to do, we congregated in the park. What a wonderful idea that was. All of a sudden about 8 ""travelers"" ambushed us from out of nowhere, throwing bangers at us and all sorts of illegal activity. Realizing our money, phones and lives were probably at risk, we ran. 

Next thing we know, the ""travelling community"" are running after us on a main road still throwing fireworks. Keep in mind their ages ranged from about 11 - 20. Chasing kids. 

We all got home safe, but never went near that park again.

In my lifetime I've met a few ""travelers"", and it has never gone over smoothly.  

My point is, they DESERVE to be called gypsies, gypos, scum bags, inbreeds, dirty bastards and the like. Do you sympathise with ISIS and middle eastern terrorist organizations when they're called terrorists? It's because that's what they are. They earned that name for themselves. If someone calls you a dick because you are a dick, then well done, you're a dick. Because of your actions, what you say and what you do, you are a dick. When people are fat, what are they called?

Even though clean sheets down to the keeper and defenders, it's noticeable since his arrival in 2008, we've never topped the clean sheets chart (this is following 3 consecutive years of Reina getting the Golden Glove). Reina and Mignolet have been there or there abouts since then but never really close to first.

However it'd be a bit unfair to put this drop in defensive quality solely on Skrtel's shoulders. Obviously the transitional period played a part along with various managerial changes and several bad transfer decisions (Konchesky..) have led to shakiness and below par performances. This could explain his lack of silverware throughout his career.

I dunno, it's interesting.

Well,we back every single dictatorship that has exists in the muslim world or the countries that help us are now suffering blowback i.e pakistan because we running around trying to gain access to their resources whilst denying them the same right as we do.  
  
you get a progressive society if THERE is a DEMOCRACY something we don't want to give the muslim world since world war 2 because they have oil or geopolitcal importance.  
 
The reason Islamism became a strong force because the people of the land viewed the government backed by the west as corrupt and the legal system as the same hence why you see the rise in sharia law as in most countries espically in the US. justice is the one with the most money wins and thats the same in the muslim world. 

&gt;There are developping catholic nations that have gay marriage (Argentina) so it shows that christians can evolve towards tolerance    
  
most of them are democracies these days with a free press hence why these things happen unlike the muslim world that dictatorship with full media control
  
&gt;Unfortunately no muslim country is a beacon of freedom and that's why I have concerns.   
 
how can you have freedom if there is no democracy and representation of the people.

Yeah, the classic ""am not a racist! look i have a black friend""

have you seen UKIP or we going to play white privilege and ignore these guys who hate the concept of human rights and also hate the working class as a whole?   
   
&gt;In a word, Islam scares me.  
  
In a 5 words, Idiots like you scare me!!   
  
Read a book and do some really research because clearly you know zero about the muslim world and what go on a daily basis's.

Instead what we are seeing is a school that is accommodating to the fact that there is a significant population who don't eat these meats.

The children you describe who receive free school meals, will still be offered somewhat of a choice, even if it doesn't include pork. So what the school have actually done is offered every child the same choice, the only true exception is likely to be non-beef eating Hindus and vegetarians. Sounds as fair as practical to me.

Finally the impoverished children you mention, have probably not been denied pork meat outright, especially seeing as many pork options are available very cheaply, so on a tight budget, pork is not necessarily off the menu when they get home.

But this frustrates me no end.

Every time I've ever driven on the M4 at the East end there's been at least one doing over a ton (100mph) and maybe 20-30% (maybe more) doing 80mph+.

And the police themselves are often doing 80+, too. Never seen a single person pulled over. You could make a mint pulling people over for speeding on the M4. I just don't understand why it isn't done.

This whole ""cars are not calibrated"" bollocks isn't good enough. Why aren't the cars calibrated ahead of time? Don't you all carry video cameras in the cars as well?

I agree with you average speed cameras are the only thing that actually slow people down - and maybe we need more of them.

They do get a choice, it's just that pork is not one of the choices that they get.

They are not being forced to do anything, they are just not being given the opportunity to eat pork if they have school meals. 

&gt; I genuinely feel that having religious based schools is harmful to society... 

Yeah I agree with this. I think that it is much better to encourage parents from all religions to send their kids to a non-denominational school so that they can interact with children from different backgrounds. If not having one specific type of meat on the school menu is likely to encourage this, then it is a small price to pay. As I said above, this has been going on for at least 5 years without anyone really bothering about it, so the lack of pork can't be too much of an issue for Islington parents.

This is so awesome, I know the guy who runs that charity and he works his arse off to make it work just so they can do cool shit for other people. 

if you're looking for something productive to do, consider giving an hour of doing whatever you do best to someone who might need the help!

Here's the latest project:
&gt; We have been approached by Vicki from Southport who's 10 year old son suffers from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a muscle wasting life shortening illness. Vicki has asked for our help with the transformation of her garden which will improve little Noah's quality of life massively. Noah is in a wheelchair and loves playing wheelchair football, his garden is too bumpy the way it is and the fact he has had spinal fractures mean Noah cannot play out there as it is.  The garden needs flattening out and artificial grass putting in to make it smooth and playable on the wheelchair, there is also a small building with a hot tub going in which is essential for Noah's therapy.

How do you know that? Look at Tesco, once considered one of the safer investments you could make. Very few people would have predicted back in 2007 their shares would have halved in value in eight years! Just noticed you have chosen Tesco too....

Are you taking a punt because you find investing in stocks is enjoyable, and like the high risk? Or do you prefer going to for the sensible option and actually getting a market rate of return, the standard for investors - i.e. actually having a primary goal of an investment?

LoL still is massively popular compared to Dota and understandably so, it's easier to get into and the learning curve is easier. I think if UK developed a good LoL scene or any other esport scene then the other games will follow. UK has always been a good scene for FPS games as I recall and I think we dominate the FPS genre. Could be massively outdated there though. 

Esports are pretty fun to watch but 9/10 only when you know what's going on. The thing about football is it's just really f'in simple someone just needs to say each team has to kick it in the net and even a baby could understand it. Most esports games are waaay more complicated and more like watching American Football. That's actually rising in popularity in UK recently which is great I love the sport. 

I think when casting isn't shit like it is now esports will be really good. I think the Asian casters are going down the right route. Just make loud noisers when kills happen and it's 100% more entertaining. Your average viewer doesn't care about items, heroes, rotations, they just care about action like in any other sport. Sure there's a lot going in Football or American football but look where the commentators are focussed - on the ball. Perhaps it's the game letting down the casters or perhaps the casters just talk waaaay too much. I think the latter is true. If you come to an esports presentation as a newbie you're greeted with a wall of alien talk. Endless talk. We don't need to know the player is building a certain item or moving round the map in a specific way, they should use that type of analysis in  the post-match break.

null,false,TheViagraKid,null,null,null,"First off...UK universities do not give a shit about extra curriculars. What they care about are relevant work experience, and grades in relevant subjects.

Your grades/scores seem pretty decent. Not amazing, hence why Exeter rejected you, but not awful. But again, it may depend on what classes you took.

The other thing that is a huge factor, is your reference and your personal statement. Every admissions tutor I've talked to said that even if your grades are good, if your statement &amp;amp; reference aren't, you're not getting in. I don't know what yours is like but you probably didn't have the coaching many applicants had as the majority will have still been in high school and probably had a specific teacher assigned to them to make sure their reference and statement were up to scratch. 

1. Really it depends on what they're looking for. Id say that you're unlikely to get an offer from Edinburgh, as they tend to have as high standards as Exeter (I got an offer from Exeter but rejected by Edinburgh last year). Lancaster has lower (but still relatively high) standards. I don't know about Glasgow as much. You may get lucky and they're looking to fill their international student ""quotas"" (I don't know if they actually have quotas but they will probably have a level of International students they aim for). 

Depending on your statement &amp;amp; reference I think you may get offers from Lancaster &amp;amp; Glasgow. But I'm not 100%. Did you check their requirements or contact their admissions before you applied?

2. Scottish universities tend to wait until after the application deadline to reply, so they'll have only started a month ago and they have several thousand to get through. You'll also be at the bottom of the pile because you applied very late. I'm not sure about Lancaster. I know they don't wait (a few friends have offers from them) but it may vary from course to course. Really you just have to sit tight and wait for that horrible UCAS email telling you something has changed.

Me and a mate went in when it was empty and got ignored at the bar for like 10 mins while we were waiting to order. Ended up walking out. Had a barmaid be pretty rude to me on another occasion. 

If I was working (which is rare actually) sorry if it was me. We are sometimes understaffed in my opinion. I wonder who the rude bar lady was. 

Yeah that's a lame experience, sorry. We are usually pretty on the ball in my experience. I mostly work nights though and we are incredibly busy. 

&gt;I will say as well that the atmosphere in Pure is very different to that of BrewDog. I know they aren't really aimed at the same market but they serve very similar things at similar prices (just talking drinks here). To me the atmosphere of BrewDog is more the kind of place I'd drink, it feels a bit more casual. 

Yeah Pure is mainly the business crowd.

If you have to be caught by a pursuing police car to be charged with both crimes then the seriousness of the second offence is probably irrelevant (because someone who tries to escape does so because they believe they can get away ... or is just plain stupid).",null,0,null,1423772274,null,0,false,0,cojjsdb,null,t3_2vknnh,null,t1_cojjsdb,null,t1_cojih67,null,null,null,1424554411,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Your analysis is so off I am baffled that you have been upvoted by so many. The BBC, the Guardian, the FT, the Economist, Bloomberg, the Times, and the Telegraph, which all cater to a middle class or ""elite"" audience, are all staffed by socially liberal metropolitan types who benefit more than most from the fruits of open migration and a multi-cultural society. Far from promoting racism, they do all they can to calm it.

On the other hand papers read by the working class such as the Sun, the Express, the People, the Star or the Mirror are all noted for their hostility to migration, in part because economic migrants often end up competing for the same jobs and public services they depend on. Ukip's core demographic are not City slickers, but white working class men.

The real reason the left is sympathetic to Muslims is because of a thoroughly decent instinct to stand up for the underdog in a fight. But actually many Muslims are highly social conservative, and the main thing that separates them from the Daily Mail reader is the particular cultural trappings that adorn that political position.

Some punter picks up a copy of 'Inverting the pyramid' and thinks that it makes him an authority on football history. Just stop and think, what exactly is this article saying? What is his point about Gerrard, beyond a few fancy similes? 

He says that English football is too archaic and then switches to say that it's too progressive, and manages to find the time to sandwich in some weird soliloquy about Gerrard, Gascoigne and Greek mythology. What the fuck is he on about?

I mean, for fuck's sake, he actually acknowledges that the structure has changed to streamline the development process. In terms of producing talented, tactically-aware players, it's as good as we've ever had it. Clubs have worked out how to use the loan system, and we've got more plowing fortunes into vast academies with the some of the best youth coaching teams European football has to offer.

He says how ""Italians have stayed true to their cynicism"" and ""Brazil to their flippancy"". What the fuck does that even mean? And even if it made any sense whatsoever, why is it being heralded as a good thing? Both countries are getting left behind in terms of quantity and quality by countries like Spain and Germany, who identified problems like England did and put in the infrastructure to change it.  

What he's basically done is taken a few lazy stereotypes, a copy of Inverting the Pyramid, and a big fucking thesaurus, then wanked the whole sticky mixture into his Ethernet port for us mere mortals to gawp at. How does it at all explain why England will never win a World Cup?

Not to mention the fact that it's written in this annoyingly pretentious tone. I mean, this is absolutely fucking impenetrable to the casual viewer:

&gt; While the blowhorn badgering, persistent pilloring, a self-conscious Luddism, a superior-inferiority complex hasn’t helped with the disillusionment of past international tournaments – the response to uproot core values of the ‘English game’ is hardly prudent.

Treat threats seriously but with a pinch of salt. Russia's economy is falling apart quickly, and imho I can't see how Russia can survive the sanctions and internal stresses they are suffering any time soon. In a time of recession you rely on your neighbours economy to get out of the bad times (that's why the global recession is so bad, because all your trading partners are suffering too, so it's harder to grow out of it, lack of demand for one thing). Russia have been cut out. We can see they are scrambling to reaffirm trading partners (for one NK). But it's just not enough, they've planned their economy badly (irony?), and with oil prices... well.

We need a proper dialogue with Russia. Straight up, what do they expect out of this? How long are they planning to get away with this for? Etc., we need to at least, if the talk end badly, properly label this war and begin to treat the humanitarian crisis facing people now living in a war zone.

I'm Asian and a lot of my family and friends are obsessed with sun protection. I've tried over 20 kinds of sunscreen but that one is honestly the best. 

If you're, say, going on a long first date in a park, I would recommend [Coppertone Water Babies](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Coppertone-Water-Babies-Sunscreen-Lotion/dp/B000Q60Z44/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423774471&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=water+babies+sunscreen). It's combination chemical and physical, but very gentle and moisturizing. The added bonus is that it blends in very easily so 
1. your face isn't shiny 
2. it won't rub off on your date in case things get hot &amp; heavy 
3. when you need to reapply it in front of your date (he might as well find out about my skin care obsession straight away) it takes 30 seconds instead of 10 minutes to completely disappear. 

Elta MD physical is also a fav, but it's 33 pounds on Amazon--$50 for a tube of sunscreen is insane for me.

In fact, in terms of pure goals-per-appearance stat, his rate (0.58) is not so far from our own Harry Kane (0.61).",null,0,null,1423775135,null,0,false,0,cojlfty,null,t3_2vkv9e,null,t1_cojlfty,null,t1_cojhwqj,null,null,null,1424555236,null,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0,null

Rolls Royce are very good at apprenticeships, I'm sure you'll enjoy it if you do decide that's what you want to do. £1 is around $2CAD. Living expenses may break down as follows:

If you want to live on your own, in a 1 bedroom house/flat/apartment between the city centre and Rolls Royce, the rent will cost you three to four hundred per month. It's not the nicest area, but nowhere in Derby is particularly bad in the grand scheme of things. Include bills, and we'll round it up to £500/month. Living in a house-share is cheaper, but you do run the risk of living with a bunch of morons if you're going into this kind of thing blindly, and without knowing the people first.

If you're careful, you can eat well on £20/week. As a young man, will you do that? Probably not. I'd advise against eating in the Rolls Royce canteen, though, as it is kind of expensive. Budget £40 a week for food, and you'll eat well without putting too much effort in. You will probably find that fruit and veg are slightly cheaper over here, and meat is much more expensive.

Fancy a takeaway once a week? That's £10.

Living in Pear Tree or Allenton, you can easily cycle or walk both to work and to the city centre, but if you want to get a bus into town it will cost you in the region of £3. A taxi might be £5 or £8, depending on where exactly you are living.

If you smoke, cigarettes are currently around 40p each. Ten a day? That's ~£30/week.

A pint of beer will cost £3-£3.50 in a pub, expect to pay around £15 for a half-decent bottle of wine in a bar. Drinking at home is much cheaper, £6 for the same bottle of wine, and £1 for the beer if you shop around.

Remember there are not four weeks in a month. There are four and a half. Your month will cost £750 of your thousand if you live alone, walk/cycle to work, eat more or less whatever you fancy for £40/week, have a takeaway once a week, and get the bus into town (and back!) once a week. This does not cover toiletries, clothing, alcohol, cigarettes, gym membership or anything else.

If your visa allows it, getting a Saturday job would earn you more money than you think. It stops you drinking too much on a Friday night, stops you spending too much on a lazy Saturday, and pays you at the same time.

During your apprenticeship, you will probably have four weeks off every year. Taking two weeks off in one block once a year is normal (if you want to go back to Canada once a year). You will also most likely have bank holidays off (in addition to the four weeks), which are 9 days most people in the country have off work. If you fancy visiting a particular place in the UK, going for a bank holiday weekend is a great way to do it (travel there on Friday after work, stay three nights, come back Monday). The only downside is that everyone else does the same thing, so expect queues for tourist attractions.

If you're an outdoorsy person, there is plenty to do near Derby for free, the usual is to plan a walk taking in a few pubs and some countryside, but we also have plenty of clubs and groups to cater to most tastes.

I'm probably going to bed now, but if you have any more questions just reply again and I'll come back tomorrow.",null,0,null,1423776235,null,0,false,0,cojm4e3,null,t3_2vojro,null,t1_cojm4e3,null,t1_cojkqnm,null,null,null,1424555554,null,3,false,derby,t5_2s8za,3,null

Remember when Suarez went out due to the Ivanovic bite and we thought shit was gonna hit the fan, but actually we headed up to the top of the league for Christmas without Suarez? 

It's like, we can do it without you. 

We have so much young talent that are proving they all have that something special - if Sterling stays imagine Ibe, Coutino - all 22, 21 and 24 respectively with Sturridge being 27 at his peak. Maybe with another great striker coming in too.

Can will be 22 bossing midfield.

The way the current Liverpool philosophy has started to click recently, along with Rodgers and the players - that's what I think will make him stay. If he wants to ruin his career he'll go and get paid a shit tonne to sit on the bench - we've seen it time and time again.

If he wants to excel, he'll stay until he's 23-24 and THEN move to Real Madrid when he'll be a starter for them. Which, one day he might. I won't hold it against him either, haven't for Suarez. They're talented individuals who have put a lot of time and hard work into their careers and they want the very best out of it. Fair enough.

ah yes the criminality of not sharing your finances, its complete bullshit. love like friendship is your freedom to dictate the terms as you see fit, if someone doesn't like them they are free to leave, making them not free to leave is already a crime, and so this legislation is nothing but an affront on civil liberties.


because in its simplest terms, if i did this to you as a friend/housemate its not a crime, but if you happen to love me, it suddenly becomes a crime, that's complete horseshit, you cant have something being non criminal for friendship and then criminal for romantic partners.

Another possibility could be Keita Baldé Diao.

Pjanic (I suppose)

Keita Baldé Diao

Attempt at Icardi (agents could easily go via Rome/meet representatives elsewhere/ a lot of competition,I had him nailed on for Chelsea in the summer). Lucas could be a part of any deal for him, Inter have wanted him for ages. Heard Lucas himself is keen too.

Nainggolan (Probably be paid more elsewhere, perfect Lucas replacement).

Perin (Again, meet reps elsewhere)

Ljajic, I'd be surprised, technically gifted but slight and prob not worth it.

Onazi, my best bet. Versatile and a rodgers type. Similar to Can in a lot of ways but with Gerrard/Lucas(heard he wants out) likely to leave there are more than just starting spots available.

Candreva from Lazio, older wing-back, replace Johnson's role if he goes.

De Vrij, decent, young, versatile CB from Lazio

I'm sure everyone has seen him but if not, he is the next big thing. One of only a very small number of players worldwide with the POTENTIAL to have a Suarez like impact at our club given enough time.

null,false,religionisanger,null,null,null,"All of my shares have some history linked to them, I've sold a lot of shares too (and made money off the back). Last year I made 5% in 3 months which was a real record for me, things started slipping in around September though and I lost a lot of faith in the stock market (even though it always is a gamble).

I'll quickly run though the choices actually:

pace - investors choice 2013 I think, was recommended among shares for new investors in investors chronicle. 

Easyjet - this was luck, but again a recommendation from somewhere (I'm not sure where) I got in just before they paid a huge bonus dividend last year, most people think they're gonna exceed 1900p this year (although they aren't doing bonus dividend this year). I'll sell at 1900p as I'll have made A LOT of money from them at this point, or I'll keep for their consistent dividend.

kcom - I know people who work there, it's a cheap business and was going very steady until I bought shares, they started dropping in the past year although they've been consistent with their dividend, a dull share to be honest - slowly going down (in my eyes the worst of all my shares as it has little volatility; it's a trap really, slow reductions making a sale each day not tempting enough - ooooh drop of 0.001%). I've kept them far too long :(...

tesco - seemed like an excellent choice after the horse meat scandal, their shares dropped like a stone and they paid MASSIVE dividend, sadly they dropped the dividend this year and their shares dropped a lot in the past 6 months. I didn't sell at the right time, but I'm convinced in 3 years they'll recover.

BDEV - Investors chronicle recommendation I think, they pay good dividend and seem fairly consistent, I sold my barrette development shares today, made £800.

Diageo their a FTSE 100 company who pay high dividend, I bought when they were exceptionally low - a long term investment, 

marlborough special situations - recommendation from hargreaves lansdown investors. 

national grid (see diageo or google retirement shares). 

judges scientific - I usually have at least one AIM shares, this was a recommendation from a friend, I observed them for a bit and saw fluctuations of up to 8% in a day; seemed like fun.

I guarantee all AIM shares will be highly volatile every day, they'll jump up and down; that's the nature of AIM and is always the case. I can always guarantee shares will go down when they pay div, go up in Feb, March and April and will mostly go down at xmas. I guarantee that shares in the FTSE100 will be less volatile than shares in the FTSE250 which will be less volatile than AIM - choose your arena, but in it there are some guarantees. My shares now are mostly based on dividend or recommendations, or in some cases off the back of a share doing REALLY bad one day despite being a highly successful business (I'm looking at oxford instruments as my next big purchase by the way, look at them over 1 month).

Index funds you don't get paid the dividend, which I reinvest in the same stocks; this has been massively profitable for easy jet and national grid, if you put enough money into shares and they DRIP they cash back in you can essentially be self sufficient (I think 5k was a magic number for me with national grid, at this point the shares were massively profitable each year). Index funds also (more or less) mirror the FTSE, I find index funds boring - you can't buy and sell by the second, fluctuations are tiny, AIM is exciting but hugely risky - if your portfolio can beat the FTSE and remain ahead, you'll always beat an index.

The chances of any FTSE100 companies going bankrupt is very small (there's probably less than 30 ever), their share prices will drop, but they'll also recover (in time). A better example than tesco is RSA; at one point their shares were worth 3000p, they're now worth a 10th of that, they're still not bankrupt. I think if your shares drop by a significant amount and you aren't quick enough to sell, you may as well hang on to the shares - it's not money in your pocket anyway, you've already lost the money if you get me. I think Wollies and Marconi were both FTSE100 companies which went bankrupt. Of course the more daring man would have seen tesco drop like a stone and bought more (I'm not that brave although they have dropped from 30% to 20% - so if I had have taken that risk my new shares would be +10% now).

I enjoy investing in stocks, I invest in mostly low risk stocks which pay high dividend, I usually sell when I make 15% return (sometimes I keep them) when/if I can I sell when I lose 15%. I find trackers/index funds boring, slow and unrewarding. I was once much more into investment and spent a lot of my ISA allowance both buying and selling, but I've become more interested in guaranteed profit now I'm looking at investing in a home which shares will never do.

I ask my family doctor for what I want quite regularly, but within the confines of the NHS which is was set up up for health not aesthetics. Unfortunately skin ageing is considered 'normal' not pathological! Last thing I got prescribed 'on demand' was 4% niacinamide (licensed for acne, but I cited research in rosacea), next request will be a mast cell stabiliser (for possible histamine intolerance).

Sanex 0% contains sulphate surfactants and fragrance so arguably does not meet your criteria. I have not used Sanex so cannot compare the two, in any case much irritation is not visible to the naked eye. The only other well priced sulphate-free foaming cleansers I know of are Boots Simply Sensitive face wash and Simple Kind To Skin Refreshing wash gel - no reason you could not use them on the body. Simple is cheap in Bodycare or permanently on offer in  one or other of the supermarkets and drugstores (Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury, Wilko, Boots, Superdrug).

I have sensitive/ reactive skin and the best thing I ever did for my skin was dropping all anionic surfactants - I may well have saved money by not constantly fighting my skin and by having far fewer incidences of contact dermatitis and thus wasted products. However if you are less sensitive you may well find Sanex does the job.

Clyne is a classic case of a young lad from the wrong side of town who did good. You can read more about the organisation that helped Clyne out when he was younger [here]( http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/07/nathaniel-clyne-england-debut-brixton-volunteers). Already at the age of 17 Clyne was playing regularly for Crystal Palace, and played every minute of Palace’s 2010-2011 league season even though he was still a teenager for most of it.    

Clyne has impressed ever since he signed for Saints. He had a brief time out of the team last year when he was coming back from injury, and because we had a decent back-up in Calum Chambers. Other than that Clyne has been an ever-present in the team since he signed. He’s physically excellent, with great stamina and some real pace, he loves to bomb up the right wing all day long. At times he can still get caught out of position, sometimes that’s because he’s too far forward due to his attacking instincts, sometimes he’s simply too far away from his centre back. However, bad mistakes from Clyne are rare. Hence he finally got his first England cap this year and, at the age of 23, it looks like he could make that right back slot his own for the next few years.

null,false,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,null,"&gt; a) It's a criminal offence, surely not reporting it is illegal already?

No, there's no legal duty to report any crime (albeit there's definitely a moral one) - with the exception of reporting money laundering if you belong to a profession (and perhaps some other niche special cases). There's a general principle that you can't get in trouble for doing nothing.

It's also not very fair to make everybody who knows a criminal but doesn't feel able to report them a criminal (out of fear or misguided affection or what have you). What if the crime is against you? e.g. battered wife syndrome. Why should I have to constantly be at risk of retribution just because I know shitty people, when somebody born in a better environment does not?

&gt; b) Why does this only apply to teachers, healthcare workers and police, surely it should apply to everyone?


No, because see a), it's not in line with the general principles of English law and it would be weird to force everybody to have a higher burden of care in this specific circumstance when there isn't one, for instance, if you witness a rape.

&gt; c) Why do we need a law to fire people? Most of these people are government workers.

What? The government can't just act entirely arbitrarily. Public workers still have employment contracts. I suppose you could write this into all of them going forward but it would be a bit odd and arbitrary. The government actually has to meet higher standards on various grounds (i.e. judicial review, human rights and EU law) than does a private sector enterprise, so it's generally good for their actions to be backed by law.

&gt; d) Why would they just face the sack? They should go to jail, they are abetting criminals.

You don't abet criminals by failing to report them. You're not helping them, you're just doing nothing. See a).

&gt; e) Are there really healthcare workers and teachers out there who aren't reporting this? If there are they are scum.

Probably. There are all sorts of factors which are difficult to anticipate from an armchair. Maybe teachers don't want to be responsible for making the tough call of breaking up a family over something that a child doesn't seem bothered about. Maybe there are feelings of confidentiality, or just that it isn't their business. Maybe people have their suspicions but ultimately just want to get on with their life.

There's a tendency to flog them off to developers for a quick buck without much regard for the long term - not just in terms of what happens to the actual building, but what happens to the surrounding area. I can't remember the last time I saw a plan that wasn't for a ""luxury"" hotel, student accommodation or a mini-supermarket. Having all of those things is fine, but surely we can only accommodate so many before we simply run out of potential customers for them? Especially in a city that trades on its heritage but keeps chipping away at it. The less Edinburgh preserves, the less well the city can hold its own against Europe's many, many well-preserved historical destinations. When development stops making sense financially, the city gets stuck with gap sites and empty buildings. That's not good for any of us, in any sense. 

There are quite a lot of vacant properties that developers don't want to touch because they're listed, so as you say, the Council leaves them sitting empty until they're derelict and have to be pulled down. These places *could* be in use - there are community groups and arts organisations crying out for space in this city. The Council could be taking rent from them and having the buildings maintained by them, but it's difficult to persuade them that they'd be better off accepting small amounts of money in exchange for short leases and having the building cared for than waiting for commercial rates that might take decades to come. Fostering community and arts groups would also be to the city's long-term cultural benefit, which is economically beneficial in the long run. 

This has come up quite a lot recently in discussions between arts groups and the Council. It would be nice to think they'll listen and we'll all benefit, but they've got to save £67 million over the next few years so I'd guess they'll flog whatever they can and the long-term be damned. :-/",null,0,null,1423779242,null,0,false,0,cojnzjt,null,t3_2vmz3e,null,t1_cojnzjt,null,t1_coj7my6,null,null,null,1424556424,null,3,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,3,null

You're borrowing to buy into a market that's already turning. At the very top of the prices. If interest rates change, or market corrects, not only will you be paying off a vast debt on something that no longer is worth that much. You will be stuck in it for a VERY long time since the sale price won't cover the debt. You may also be repossessed when bank decides that since the value of the asset securing the loan no longer covers the debt you need to provide for the difference. And even when the bank won't do it you might end up bankrupt anyway once the fixed term finishes.

There's probably not been a worse time to buy than the past half a year. There's a reason transaction levels and mortgage borrowing stats collapsed.

Unless you ask an estate agent or mortgage broker. If you ask them, then of course, now is always the best time to buy. But do you want to bet your future life on their interest in obtaining the commission?

To be fair, you are half correct. Now is the best time to borrow. But NOT to buy. If you can secure a loan at these rates without actually putting the money into property, you're golden. Many huge companies are doing just that right now. Borrowing a lot at crazy low interest. But they aren't buying into overinflated assets.

My 'baby' is lifestyle healthcare - my role is more 'holistic' encompassing physical activity, nutrition and smoking cessation but there are NHS and private specialists in each field.

They want a prescription for a magic bullet and to otherwise carry on as they are, if they cannot have that they want a herbal magic bullet.
