For the past year, I have been undertaking discussions with Tommy Robinson and more recently with the leadership of the EDL to prevent further inter-communal tensions and violence. I recognised that there was an opportunity to promote better community cohesion between various communities in Dudley and that this may serve as a model for further dispute resolution in other towns and cities.

&gt;“The EDL marched in Dudley in February 2015, despite our best efforts to stop this. The march cost UK tax payers £1m, and there was no way that I wanted this to happen again. I continued my engagement with Tommy Robinson to prevent another march. There was an opportunity for me to use my experience as a strategist in Kandahar by getting people to talk face to face and then recount to their communities what was discussed and that a settlement was agreed.”

&gt;He added: “It’s a shame that it seems Tommy Robinson has been seduced by money to launch this attack on me. He is a convicted fraudster and has a salacious appetite for money, which has seen him snub a real job and opt for the spreading of hatred during his long, one year sting operation.”

What? It's not like managers past a certain age can't adapt to managing a big club. But none of them have ever done anything to make a big club want them - Pardew had one great season with Newcastle which he quickly showed he couldn't replicate, Allardyce built a good Bolton side but one that was very robust and didn't play great football, and Sherwood is new. If Pardew had backed up that Newcastle season wit another top 8 finish, you can be sure he'd have been getting linked to bigger jobs.

Redknapp wasn't harshly sacked - Spurs were coming 3rd after winning the derby against Arsenal, then Capello quit and ""'Arry for England"" began - with no little encouragement from the man himself. Spurs then collapsed to let Arsenal finish above them, while 'Arry tried to strongarm Levy into a new contract. Redknapp's 100% responsible for his sacking.

&gt;  I wonder if Fenway purposely selected British managers or it was just coincidence that they went through Roy/Kenny/Brendan.

Roy was there when FSG inherited it, Kenny was the logical short-term replacement who earned the full-time job with his performances; the only real time they could've been pro-British is selecting Rodgers.

I brought this up since generally not many managers come through to big clubs when they are older (I'm likely wrong, but can't think of any examples). Just seems impossible for someone to cement themselves as a top manager in the premier league, compared to other leagues. I can't remember fully but Martin O'Neill was fantastic for Villa until half the team got sold wasn't he?

There is a trope in fiction about having a girl who is romantically involved with the male protagonist and only seems to exist for the purpose of eye candy+dying later on to create drama. That's what Dany really was for season 8. 

I think the one major major part of the season that you don't mention here is that Clara and the Doctor are both growing and changing a lot over the course of the season. The Doctor was trying to figure out who he really is now that Day of the Doctor and Time of the Doctor changed his history+forced him to fight a war for hundreds of years. Clara on the other hand was trying to figure out how to remain tied to Earth (part of the appeal of Dany is his ability to provide that tie I think) but still go on these crazy adventures. 

Over the course of the season the Doctor found himself and Clara lost herself as their relationship was shaken up and evolving in almost every episode. Compare the interaction between them in Into the Dalek where Clara functions as a strong moral compass to an unapologetically manipulative Doctor to their interaction in Flatline where she watches people die in front of her, has no problem manipulating them or lying to Danny and is beaming with pride at the end while the Doctor is the one to remind her of the morality of her actions.

What the hell.. I don't give a shit about his potential, that's completely irrelevant. Im asking you if you're saying Kane is better than those players and the fact that you're beating around the bush about it tells me how little you know. How on earth is it debatable that those players are better than Kane??  I didn't bother mentioning your other factors because of how ridiculous they are. The brunt of your argument comes from goal/assist stats, which is dumb because the players have different roles in their team. Because by your logic Willian would be the shittiest winger in the league because he doesn't get goals and assists. 

&gt;Sanchez had 19 goals at Barca last season. Bale had 15. This season Sanchez playing in a much more defensive league has 13 goals 7 assists, Bale has 12goals 5 assists. Sanchez is a better player.

This is ridiculous. You compare the two players using two stats and you make your conclusion on them. 

Then you go on to mention ""work rate"". Do you not understand that players have different roles in their team? Neymar has a really low workrate but does that mean it makes him a worse player? No it doesn't, because he doesn't need to have high work rate. As a comparison, Hazard would need a higher work rate because of how Chelsea/Mourinho play. 

Not to mention the fact that you're acting as if Sanchez is playing in a tougher league lmao. He's been in shit form since Ozil came back, he performed dreadfully against Monaco, he doesn't play well in big games. Ivanovic put him in his pocket like it was nothing in the game against Arsenal. Great player, but Bale is the better player. Bale scores more important goals, plays very good in big games and is better at what he does. 

I don't care if you think Sanchez is a better player than Bale, just don't base your entire argument on goals and assists ffs, they don't determine who is a better player.

Otherwise you don't have any effective addressing of issues or challenges to structural problems - just delaying them year after year by giving them money. Charities should instead address the core reasoning for their existence and seek to help solve those issues, and aim to 'close'. 

Of course this isn't practical in every application as some issues are ongoing, but for certain causes the approach is just all wrong.

Skrtel should be able to deal with that.

At the other end of the pitch I fancy Coutinho, Sterling, Sturridge and Lallana to carve out at least 3-4 clear cut chances, which should be enough to get at least one past de Gea.

I really hope Gerrard doesn't start; I feel an intense pressing game is the way to beat Yernited and with his legs gone he isn't up to the task. Besides, Henderson has been playing out of his skin lately, and Allen is having his best run of form for us since his first few games back in 2012.

The part that impressed me most: 

&gt; Rodgers likes British players and he does not buy into the idea that they lack the technical ability of their European counterparts. He thinks tactical awareness is the problem, and he blames the weather as much as anything because tactical coaching is difficult in the winter months when players just need to keep warm.

&gt; With the academy staff Rodgers has already addressed this with the club’s nine to 16-year-olds. They now have the second half of December and January off but remain at the academy right through to mid-July, when the weather is more suited to slowing things down and teaching kids what Rodgers calls the ‘tactical concepts’ properly. Simple but very clever.

If that doesn't get you excited for the future, then I don't know what will. He's building a framework for success for the long term.

This is the cyclist who, according to the driver, veered ""slightly from the lane he should have been in"".

His experience doesn't matter. In fact, you'd expect an experienced cyclist to know the laws of the road and the requirements to successfully merge.

And while I have no personal knowledge of the case, I do know that the jury agreed with the driver. There simply wasn't evidence that the driver was using the cellphone at the time of the collision, or that there was any way he could have avoided the crash. The fact that he successfully avoided a pedestrian just prior to the crash with the cyclist seems to show that he was in reasonable and responsible control of his vehicle.

Other comments tries to make the claim that everyone in the jury uses cell phones irresponsibly, breaks the speed limit, runs red lights, and therefore every jury is biased against cyclists.

But that's simply not the case. If the cyclist had been in a car, and decided that his potholed lane of the road was poor to drive on and change lanes without warning and got rear-ended... while alive, he'd still be just as much at fault.

Just because you're a cyclist doesn't mean that you have any special rights. Cyclists are responsible to follow *every* law that a motor vehicle must follow. Failure to do so may have more severe consequences beacuse of the lack of protection that a cyclist has in a collision with a motor vehicle. But it certainly doesn't mean that people don't care about hurting other people, or that everyone in a car is a lawbreaker, or that every jury is made of other lawbreakers.

Now I'm not arguing the opposite... that every driver treats cyclists with the respect they deserve as a fellow road user. I'm just saying it just means that accidents happen, and believing that bicyclists are always innocent is the exact sort of bias that you and OP are trying to claim against you.",null,1,null,1426988002,null,0,false,0,cpmjnjr,null,t3_2zulfu,null,t1_cpmjnjr,null,t1_cpmggrv,null,null,null,1431940737,null,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4,null

The whole squad selection smacks of ""Hodgson favourites"" which is what seems to have replaced the ""big team bias"".

Shaw is a great prospect but after such an injury hit season and little playing time he should have been sent to the U-21's if called up at all.

Ross Barkley has had a distinctly average season, Townsend shouldn't be there at all, Walker has missed most of the season and been borderline shit since he came back. Jones and Smalling are only there because we have such a lack of decent English defenders

I can see the argument for lack of viable alternatives when it comes to calling up Barkley, Townsend, Jones, Smalling etc. And I can kind of get what people are saying about having Shaw around the squad if he's going to be the long term LB.

Only problem I have with Poch is that we're sitting on a lead, and the other team looks dangerous on the break, we just keep doing the same thing and usually lose control.

All Leicester could do was hit us on the break. Their whole game plan was built on that. Once we go 2 up, they should be dead in the water. But we kept pushing so high up the pitch, letting our full backs push into their box and got ripped a new one every time they won the ball. It's insanity at times.

Kane was unreal. Eriksen still looks a little off for some reason but he's getting back to his usual best. Rose has just been a different player this season, so happy for him. But the rest of our defence were just horrendous. Chadli legitimately looked high, some of the stuff he did out there was just... 

Can anyone tell me the point of signing Fazio. I think he's a great player, complete dominance in the air, experienced, hard nut, leader and organiser.

It is more like it than you think. Many families take on a huge debt in the form of mortgage. They do this to get early access to a house big enough to grow the family in. This debt is sustained by the money the family makes.

As the need for the house and the ability to sustain the debt tail off over time the mortgage is arranged so it is paid off over time. 

If the need for debt and ability to maintain debt never diminish then an ongoing debt position is likely. Which is the situation any decent sized ongoing enterprise find itself in.

&gt;__Patellar tendon rupture__ is a rupture of the tendon that connects the patella to the tibia. The superior portion of the [patellar tendon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_tendon) attaches on the posterior portion of the [patella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella), and the posterior portion of the patella tendon attaches to the [tibial tubercle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibial_tubercle) on the front of the [tibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia). Above the patella are the [quadriceps muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps_muscle) (large muscles on the front of the thigh), the quadriceps tendon attaches to the top of the patella. This structure allows the knee to flex and extend, allowing use of basic functions such as walking and running.

I really like Rose. I liked her in the first season (of the reboot) and all the way through. Why? I don't know, I just loved watching her episodes. I think she really helped me like Dr. Who. After watching the reboot one episode at a time and in order I fall more and more in love with Dr. Who. It's an amazing show, even though at times the special effects are cheesy. 

I did feel bad for Mickey er.... Rickey. And I though the writers did a good job of having him say stuff like ""you meet the doctor and don't care about me anymore.""

Another supplier that might be getting used more in the Prem: [Catapult](http://www.catapultsports.com/us/sports/football) (currently being used by Newcastle and fairly extensively in the NFL)

Anyway, that should be enough information for anyone interested.

Anyway, many charities do aim to complete their work and close down but often the problems they try to solve are beyond their reach. Shelter would close much of its operations if we could end homelessness, but the likelihood is that isn't going to happen. Landmine charities, most are looking forward to closing those operations down at some point in the future. Most charities deal with the branches rather than the roots and aside from campaigning have very limited power to change anything at a systemic level. They just treat the symptoms whether that is hunger, isolation, depression or whatever else  

There is a counter to this though, once a charity has established itself, built a supporter base, earned credibility, demonstrated impact and all of that, it is often better to redirect those resources at a related topic rather than just stop and then have to start again. 

Charities are ultimately just filling gaps where the economy and government have failed to provide solutions. They will continue to exist as long as those gaps remain. I've worked for charities for nearly a decade and I would dearly love for there to be no need for them anymore. But in this era of austerity and big society, the reality is that they are more important than ever.

&gt;The Police will also respond to domestic alarms, when there is some evidence of criminal activity. Should there be an activation and there is evidence of criminal activity or you see something suspicious, dial 999. It is not advisable to put yourself in danger by making checks yourself.

&gt;If it appears to be a false activation, still contact the police but on their non-emergency number as they may have the owners contact details on their database.

&gt;If it is a persistent problem see the question in related information about noisy neighbours.

*My neighbours car alarm is always going off, what can I do?*

&gt;If the car alarm is a false activation and not someone attempting to steal/break into the vehicle then first it would be advisable to speak to your neighbour about the problem as they may not be aware what is happening. If the problem persists then you should contact the Environmental Protection department at your local council who have powers to deal with nuisance car alarms.

Also check if your work or uni do a cycle to work scheme (can save tons if they do). If not look for refurbed bikes from local shops. Most wee bike shops will do this and again can save you a ton of money for a bike that is equivalent of brand new. No matter how shiny a bike you buy if you ride it lots, chain it up it will start to look a little worn so don't be too hung up on it being shiny and new. 

What sort of bike you want will depend on where you live and how hilly it is. What you plan to do with the bike? Commuting only you probably want a road bike as a they're light. If you want to get out and explore you want a hybrid bike that's a cross between a road and mountain bike, they have front suspension which can be locked out for speed on roads and give you some give over bumps. Starting out I'd recommend this as a good way to go from my experience. They're heavier but I live in a second good flat and that hasn't been a problem getting it up and down. Mountain bikes look cool but if you want to ride them in roads you will lose a lot of power to their suspension springs flexing.

In that when and if are pretty much the same word in German. When implies finality in English in that it will happen but I'm not sure if it does in the German, certainly without context I have no idea. Nor do I actually know much about German even if English is Germanic.

Also, here is [a bild article](http://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/bastian-schweinsteiger/keine-gedanken-ueber-zukunft-39309994.bild.html) that talks about his contract. Where he does say he's not concerned about extending it yet, he has a year and a half left and plenty of time to negotiate an extension. (The article is from January)

Also an [article \(about.com\)](http://german.about.com/library/blconfus_wann.htm) about the use of when/if in German.

Most people in the West, I reckon, get along living more or less sober, careful, thoughtful lives, making progress themselves and caring for those around them, but our mass media is constantly going completely ape-shit for attention, controversy, eye-balls and revenue, giving a completely different impression to anyone looking in from outside.

I remember watching some documentary about electricity and TV coming for the first time to a tiny village in Bhutan, it was all about this husband trying to bring a TV back to the village, on a donkey from the local city through the mountainous terrain. At the end the family gathered together, sat down, and watched their first programme available on the local channel, which was American wrestling - we're talking full on WWE ""OMG SOMEONE STOP HIM! HE'S GOING TO USE A STEEL CHAIR!"". The final shot was the family looking at this fucking agog.

I reckon it must be quite similar for people living within immigrant communities in the West, isolated from grass roots contact with ordinary people outside that community. It would be easy to look at Britain as the Sun, the Daily Mail, Jeremy Kyle, X-Factor, America as Fox News, my teen pregnancy, wrestling, and pornography, look at the lack of interest and discussion about your country's foreign policy near the place where your family came from, and conclude that the West was some sort of unified monolithic Mammon. Especially when there is a strong ideological narrative already well established which makes it easy to filter out the evidence to the contrary.

One vaguely similar example would be with the Irish-American community in the US - loving their Romantic ancestral roots, isolated from individual contact with the people actually involved first hand. Look on Britain as Margaret Thatcher and the Daily Mail personified, tie it in with the historical narrative about Cromwell etc, and end up with widespread support for organizations that deliberately kill civilians.

It's very difficult to know how this can be countered. I suppose the most important thing is encouraging person to person contact across different communities, for instance for schools to be highly mixed, and try to get to a situation where people have friends and understand individuals from outside their community. But I suspect that we will have to continue living lives huddled underneath a substantially crazy mass media, because, unfortunately, there is no reasonable alternative in order to maintain political freedoms.

Edit: FWIW, of course none of this goes anywhere within a million miles of justifying ISIS. I was purposefully not engaging with those fundamentalist ideologies. That whole concept about killing your own civilians to drive them in terror towards a religion, is insane on a level which is hard to even grasp.

This may be because you're trying to do the job of a BA, PM, Designer, Developer and Tester to say the least. However in start-ups at the beginning this is the only way and you can only do your research and hope to take the right decisions for the future. Some points to consider from my experience in a start-up 

Define Business Requirements: What are you trying to build? Before continuing with your development work, have a second look at your requirements (if not define them).  Listing companies that employ technology guys is like listing all the companies in public registries, there is a huge market out there and just listing them won’t help anybody  (think ahead when you’ll have 20.000 companies just for London). Try to define what will be your target audience and how you could implement something that is not already in the market. An example “The representative visitor of my website will be between 16-29 years old searching entry and mid level technology jobs in London. He has limited time at hand and don’t have a defined strategy to search for jobs&lt;list further traits &gt; ”. This way you’ll start understanding what visitors you want to attract, the problems in the market and possible solutions that are better them the one found in the market already. There is a whole career and hundred of books about this – research what you need 

Seek ways to implement your requirements: For example your methodology now is to wait for people that view your website to email you a company and you add it manually. This solution is weak and maybe suited for a market that is not transparent and very small. Suggestion: If you don’t change anything in your requirements and want to go ahead with your current idea go to any business intelligence database (e.g Mint, Morningstar, Bloomberg) select market, select industry, and put some constraints to narrow your search to your defined audience. However you’ll have a couple of thousands relevant companies for London only. Now that you got your list seek ways to automate the job…

After doing your strategy and methodology, implementing the website is only a mater of time to develop, test and release. A big mistake this days with people is going global with a poor business idea and fail, consider targeting ONLY one market like London, define the idea, find solution to implement and do it. This way is much- much more manageable and if successful will go global naturally. Best wishes.

null,false,donttrustasoulhomie,null,null,null,"&gt; Ministers defeated a move to amend the Official Secrets Act to ensure that it bars no one from giving evidence about VIP paedophiles.
&gt; 
&gt; Theresa May, home secretary, last week repeated in Parliament assurances that the act should not stop anyone from giving evidence to the overarching inquiry into child sex abuse (CSA). David Cameron even underlined the assurance at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; But Exaro can reveal that May and most of her coalition colleagues in the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties blocked an attempt in Parliament to change the Official Secrets Act (OSA) to give legal backing to such assurances.
&gt; 
&gt; The government defeated the amendment proposed by John Mann, Labour MP in a night-time vote in February that went unreported. An alert Exaro reader drew it to our attention.
&gt; 
&gt; Mann told Exaro: “What people need are absolute guarantees of protection under the OSA. From what I am hearing, people’s biggest concern about whistleblowing is being prosecuted under the OSA.”
&gt; 
&gt; He tried to introduce the amendment to the Serious Crime Bill as it was going through Parliament, and would have created a defence to a charge under the OSA for anyone who had supplied material to an official investigation or inquiry into child sex abuse.
&gt; 
&gt; The amendment was defeated by 295 MPs to 233. The move was opposed by 254 Conservatives and 40 Liberal Democrats, suggesting a whipped vote. But Mann’s proposal was supported by 233 MPs in the 9.15pm vote on February 23, including 207 from Labour, as well as 8 Conservatives and 3 Liberal Democrats.
&gt; 
&gt; Mann said: “My amendment would have given immunity from prosecution only in relation to historical incidences of child abuse. It was very clear, targeted and concise.”
&gt; 
&gt; He found May’s opposition “very peculiar”. He said that his amendment would have provided clarity for serving or former public officials not only for the CSA inquiry, but also police investigations. “There are people who are not providing information to ongoing police investigations because of the uncertainty over the Official Secrets Act,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; A spokesman for the Home Office said: “The home secretary has already stated that the Official Secrets Act will not stop people giving evidence to the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse. 
&gt; 
&gt; “In addition, there are long-standing precedents for the attorney general to guarantee that witnesses will not be prosecuted for evidence they give to public inquiries.”
&gt; 
&gt; He said that May has written to Lowell Goddard, the New Zealand judge who is chairing the CSA inquiry to suggest that “she might wish to secure such a guarantee from the attorney general.”
&gt; 
&gt; The spokesman added: “She is clear that the Official Secrets Act should not prevent people from coming forward to give evidence to this inquiry.”
&gt; 
&gt; May repeated the assurance when giving evidence to MPs on the House of Commons home affairs committee on Tuesday, although it hardly amounted to immunity from the OSA. She said: “I hope they would not be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act, and would not expect them to be.”
&gt; 
&gt; On Monday, [the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced that it was investigating allegations that Scotland Yard had halted operations that uncovered evidence of child sex abuse by MPs and others](http://exaronews.com/articles/5525/scotland-yard-s-charge-sheet-for-cover-up-on-vip-paedophiles), adding pressure on the government to provide a clear-cut immunity from the OSA for serving and former police officers and other public officials.
&gt; 
&gt; Exaro also reveals today that [the IPCC investigation will cover allegations that police suppressed operations that might have exposed Lord Brittan, former home secretary, as a paedophile.](http://exaronews.com/articles/5523/leon-brittan-ipcc-investigates-claim-of-cover-up-for-top-tory)
&gt; 
&gt; Tom Watson, Labour MP, who supported Mann’s amendment, last week started [a petition to demand a clear immunity for police and intelligence officers who can provide relevant information for the IPCC investigation](https://www.change.org/p/the-prime-minister-abuse-cover-up-inquiry-protect-whistleblowers?recruiter=11291174&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=share_twitter_responsive).
&gt; 
&gt; He pressed Cameron during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday about the issue, asking: “Notwithstanding the reassurances from the home secretary, will the prime minister please give a cast-iron guarantee that former public officials with knowledge of the cover-ups are given full whistleblower protections?”
&gt; 
&gt; Cameron replied: “I am absolutely clear about the fact that I do not want anyone to be prosecuted for uncovering wrongdoing in such a way.”",null,0,null,1427023367,null,0,false,0,cpmuha1,null,t3_2zw82n,null,t1_cpmuha1,null,t3_2zw82n,null,null,null,1431945980,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Theresa May, home secretary, has repeatedly given assurances that the act should not stop anyone from giving evidence to the overarching inquiry into child sex abuse (CSA). However, as Exaro reports today, [the government defeated a proposed amendment to the Official Secrets Act (OSA).](http://www.exaronews.com/articles/5529/ministers-block-move-to-lift-official-secrets-act-for-csa-scandal)

John Mann, Labour MP, moved the amendment to insert the following clause in the OSA: “It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under any provision of this Act to prove that he knew, or had reasonable cause to believe, that the information, document or article disclosed was a) germane to an official investigation of, or inquiry into, historic child abuse, and b) provided only to an officer of such an investigation or inquiry.”

Mann told Exaro: “It would not have undermined the Official Secrets Act.”

“The amendment was in for quite a period of time. I am aware that Zac Goldsmith, a Conservative MP who backed the proposal, raised it. It was not a last-minute thing, and was not something that MPs did not have time to consider.”

The disclosure of the government’s blockage of amending the OSA comes as Exaro also reveals how [the Independent Police Complaints Commission’s investigation into allegations of cover-ups by the police goes far wider than Sir Cyril Smith, the former Liberal MP who died in 2010](http://www.exaronews.com/articles/5523/leon-brittan-ipcc-investigates-claim-of-cover-up-for-top-tory). This is the full list of how MPs voted on Mann’s proposed amendment to the OSA, broken down by party.

Hitler hated people in the leadership of his own party, national bi-partisanship is clearly not an aspect of nazism or fascism.

The support system is great too: Careers service are useful and provide free meetings and full time support. There is a bursary program and also a financial advice service on the campus (at The Base)

Job prospects during the degree exist but are slightly less common than at some other universities - it's easy enough to get bar or waiting work from what I can tell (although it's minimum wage and you most likely will not get to keep your own tips) 

Summer work / internship support is good too, you can get support from your department and also from the careers service 

Post degree lancaster is top 10 in the UK for employment rates and highly ranked in most subjects.


If you have any more questions, be them more personal (for example about societies and clubs) , about uni in England in general (driving, drinking and exams) or anything else, feel free to PM me :)

He also had 2 box to box mid fielders. This season, one thing that was the problem was that he had a back 3 more like how Bruce set out his Hull team to have his back 3. Not a sweeper so to speak, like how we use and also how Van Gaal used Blind in the 90's as his sweeper. He never really uses 2 strikers nor 2 defensive mid fielers. If you're talking about his Manchester United team now, then perhaps but that isn't his preferred team at all. Our formation, what can be broken down into a 3-4-3/3-5-2 is, when broken down again, a typical Van Gaal 3-3-1-3. (Replace these players with ours and you can see the similarities http://www.fm-base.co.uk/forum/attachments/football-manager-2012-tactics-training/262320d1343409084-louis-van-gaal-ajax-91-97-tactic-help-needed-ajax-95-old.jpg)

For anyone else interested, Van Gaal's 3-3-1-3 system has been adopted by Bielsa and Guardiola and that's why I see Van Gaal as a great coach because only great coaches can get that system to work.

Surely for the survival of Scottish football we need a strong Rangers. They should be promoted regardless as the premier league has been a disaster without them, there's been almost no parity or excitement at all.

If this season has shown is anything it's this: go with proven experience that you are paying astronomical wages to and grind out the results necessary to win the league at a canter. Do not put your faith in young players to play fast, attacking and pure football - this couldn't possibly bring success.

null,false,RichieSM,cnty-wales,London,null,"You make some great points, but proper integration has never happened in Britain and it never will.

It's been going on for years; that's why we have areas like Chinatown in central London (although that's largely a tourist attraction), Southall (Indian), West Acton (Japanese), Tower Hamlets (Bangladeshi), and others.

They'll move here, stick to their cultural groups and rarely interact with anyone from outside that group. They won't even speak English in their day-to-day lives.

Living in London I see this every day, and I often ask myself why they come here. I'd love to know why they do. Is it for the money? I'm here for the same reason, but I'm British so integration doesn't apply to me... or maybe I'm the outsider?

Apparently only 45% of London people are now classed as White British which is interesting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London

That's not necessarily a bad thing, and being mixed in among different cultures is pretty cool. I live with the Japanese in Acton and they are lovely, polite and respectful people.

An added bonus is that I only have to cross the road to get proper sushi.

null,false,mr_honeybadger,null,null,null,"The ISA earn rate (if it's a cash ISA) will depend on the company who is holding your money, so one company may have different rules on when what the AER is, introductory rates etc. So check with your provider to ensure that you won't be getting an introductory rate for the first year that drops a huge amount the next year.

As for transferring, you need to go through the official **transfer** process for it to not count as a new ""subscription"". If you withdraw it and then deposit again in a new provider, it will count as double the subscription used for that tax year.

However, there are a couple rules with transfers:

If the contributions have been made in the current tax year and you wish to transfer that money, you must transfer **all of it**. Subscriptions made in previous tax years you can transfer as much or as little as you'd like to.

&gt; ## What you can transfer
&gt; You can transfer a cash ISA to another cash ISA with a different provider. You can do the same with stocks and shares ISAs.

&gt; You can also transfer a cash ISA to a stocks and shares ISA or vice versa.

&gt; If you want to transfer money you’ve invested in an ISA this current year, you must transfer all of it.

&gt; For previous years, you can choose to transfer all or part of your savings.

67: Balotelli yellow card for a tackle on Jones. Silly tackle. 

68: Foul from Sakho

69: STURRIDGE! FANTASTIC RUN BY HENDO, FANTASTIC GOAL! Studs of Jones might have confused him

70: Allen can't control his strength, knocks down Fellaini for a foul.

71: Migs punches Di Maria's free kick out, goes back in and oh fuck Migs catches ball and he is hurt. Looks deliberate, he might have slipped but looks like Rooney was being a shithead and knocked Migs on purpose. 

72: We look rejuvenated! Sterling foul gives ball to United though. 

73: Ah fuck Balo misses the ball from Sterling

74: Smalling fouls, we get a free kick. United looking sloppy and I'm shaking in excitement. 

75: Balo? hits wall :(
 
76: It's an honour to watch them give it their all from nothing. Another foul from Felliani. Good attempt at a pass by Allen but no luck. 

77: Sterling foul :(

78: A lot of pressure on our defence, handling it well so far. Thank you Atkinson for not sending off Balo, would be harsh though but worried me at the time.

79: Another foul given to us.

80: Not sure why but http://beba.tv/watch/liverpool-vs-manchester-live-stream-2.php has had Gerrard sent off '46 for the entire second half. Also my dog is barking so give me a sec. 

81: My dog wants to play but she'll have to wait. Also Hendo takes a corner, nothing comes of it. 

82: Falcao comes on, hope he isn't feeling so sad about his situation anymore. Herrera off which should be better for us going forward right? Rooney dropping back the commentators think.

83: Mignolet rolls ball out safely, not much going on otherwise. Skrtel hoofs a ball up ends up in De Gea's hands. 

84: Good ball skills by Migs again, gets it out safely. Glad to see he isn't hurt too much as well, was worried we'df be with Jones for abit. Also a corner. 

85: Couts corner comes to nothing. End up with a throw, will anything happen? Scrappy and we end up with Allen fouling Falcao.

86: Not much going on, my dog is quiet though so there's that.

87: Foul again, Rooney fouls Coutinho. Straight red? If only we were so lucky. Atkinson has been great today. 

88: Great tackle by Falcao, Di Maria crosses too far and Mata ends up with the ball on the side. Mata passes to Valencia but Hendo deals with him and gives United the throw. 

89: Another United throw, don't worry though we've got this in the bag. 3-2 with a ~~Gerrard~~ Henderson double surely?

90: We are going to score right? 

91: Di Maria crosses to Fellaini. United playing around stalling the game. 

92: Whoops, well Mignolet will save this right.

93: Called it, we'll score now!

94: ohfuckohfuckohfuck?!?!?!?!? come on come on fuck, ball just too long for Skrtel and he is pissed at De Gea, who I think is hurt. Fucking hell another stamp. 

Not the best game, heated but we done ourselves proud in the end. Good goals, though it's a shame United will lose to City Arsenal and end up 5th.

&gt;3.6 Opening a Help to Buy: ISA will, in most ways, be identical to opening a regular ISA under
the existing cash ISA rules.

meaning that you could have this as your cash ISA and the rest of your allowance in a separate S&amp;S ISA under the current NISA rules.

Original text below

------------------------

There are some ""downsides"" to it, although they're questionable downsides.

It is an ISA, so you can't have any other NISA going on at the same time. For people that are just putting money in a cash ISA that's not really much of an issue as the interest rates on those are probably going to continue to be unappealing. Stocks and shares might be more comparable, and you might not want to lose that.

You can deposit £1000 as a lump sum when you open it, and then a max of £200 per month, meaning that the maximum you can put in this ISA is £3400 in the first year and then £2400 each subsequent year, which is nowhere near the £15k you can usually put into an ISA. This might be unappealing to people who can and do max out their ISA allowance each year and get good rates on their S&amp;S ISAs. Although it's questionable whether people who are maxing out their ISAs each year overlap much with FTBs struggling to find a deposit.

At the max of £3400 and £2400 subscription, assuming a 0% interest rate, it'll take 55 months to hit the £12000 total that will give you the maximum £3000 bonus. It's important to note that the interest accrued does contribute to the subscription, so if you deposit (pulling numbers out of thin air) £11000 over the 4+ years and get £1000 in interest, that takes you to the £12000 required. You can expect that 55 months to realistically be something closer to 50 depending on the interest rate offered by the particular vendor you choose. Maybe banks will see this as an opportunity to offer some decent rates for a while.

Overall, the fact that it is an ISA and so competes with other ISAs that allow the full £15k they seem questionable. However, with cash ISA rates being so appalling, current/savings account rates being fairly decent, **and** the new [£1000 Personal Savings Allowance](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/personal-savings-allowance) coming into play next year maybe a lot of people who this is marketed at don't really care about losing out on the rest of the ISA tax-free allowance.

Edit to add: £3400/£2400 might be a bad way to express the numbers, as if these arrive in ""autumn"" you won't get a full year to hit that £3400 before April. It's £1000 initial max deposit then £200 max per month (including the first month). Just keep that in mind while doing your own calculations.",null,0,null,1427037500,null,0,1427043383,0,cpmyxy3,null,t3_2zwfut,null,t1_cpmyxy3,null,t3_2zwfut,null,null,null,1431948082,null,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5,null

It's fairly amusing how many people paint christians with the same brush, but get all SJW when Islam is mentioned. 

Islam has all the bad views of christianity and the Torah, and sprinkles a bit more violence on to it. This, by no means, means that everyone practicing islam is the same. It does mean that the religion has potential to lead astray, and this is something that has been proved over and over again.

The Abrahamic religions are from 2000+ years ago, when war, usually in the name of a god, was common. For example, this from the Quran (9:29-30): 

*Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they are humbled.
The Jews say, ""Ezra is the son of Allah ""; and the Christians say, ""The Messiah is the son of Allah ."" That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?*

The fact so many people stick up for religion baffles me, and I can only assume they have never had persistent interactions with religious people or read any religions texts. Going to a catholic school and reading the bible turned me atheist, mainly because I saw this has no place in modern society and its ""fairy tale-ness"" was glaringly obvious.

I fucking hate Manchester United. Not because they won today. Not at all. In fact over the course of the 90 minutes, they probably deserved to come away with the three points. I fucking hate this idea that a Liverpool loss means that we're going to shit the bed and murder a kitten. Took myself a little trip over to /r/soccer to explain that for me Atkinson ruined the game, can't complain about the Gerrard decision, he deserved to go but it seemed like there were one set of rules for United and another for us. Pointing that out alone got me responses such as 'embarrassing' and 'typical scouser' - no, fuck off, he was fucking shite. Atkinson made so many poor decisions and the worst part is that the Gerrard decision was correct and is going to be the only thing that's talked about. 

Their second goal came directly from Atkinson blocking off Allen's run while he was trying to press. From there we were out of position and Mata had freedom to move. That's a fair enough point right? ***WRONG*** - I'm bitter, I'm embarassing, I'm exactly what United fans expect. Well I fucking hate Manchester United's fans think their team is. They're not a Real Madrid, they're not a Barcelona, they're not a Juventus, they're not a Bayern Munich and they're not even close to a Manchester City. Every single result is because ***THEIR MANAGER AND THEIR PLAYERS ARE THE BEST EVER MANAGER AND PLAYERS EVER AND THEY PLAY AMAZING FOOTBALL THAT IS BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE***. FUCKING WRONG AGAIN. United were fucking wank today - I've already said, better than us, we weren't good. United haven't been good at all this season. Not once. They've been average and for a team that's spent over £200million in 3 transfer windows, that's fucking ridiculous. 

I fucking hate their manager who believes he fucking invented playing football, I hate their shitcunt captain with his unconvincing sewn on toupee, I hate their over-rated, overpaid south American contingent who contribute to the ever growing average play in the league because they feel they're above it. I fucking hate Phil Jones and his stupid fucking face, I fucking hate the stupid fucking immature songs they sang today, I hate that their club is basically home of 'banter' (surprise surprise I also fucking hate banter).

few other things. **skrtel's last minute ""stamp"" on de gea**, i really don't think it was malicious. man was running, he needed to stop, that generally involves putting a foot down. de geas leg happened to slide into it.** Rooney's ""tackle"" on migs** wasn't malicious either, just unlucky. he was immediately apologetic, which i don't see often from the cunt, so i can't say he did it on purpose. **atkinson**....well, contrary to neville's opinion, he did not have a great game. he was holding the 2 teams to entirely different standards. however, **we can't put the blame on the ref**, sure he made shit calls, but we fucked up in the first half, and lacked bite in the 2nd, though we played well.

final words: i think **we can be extremely proud of the way we played in the 2nd half**, especially after Gerrard got sent off.** we didn't give up**, unlike /u/ruggomatic and a few other ""supporters"" in the thread. instead, we played harder, and brought the game to united. we **just need to figure out how to play with the same intensity right from the get go.**

Our play in the 1st half of the match was torrid, and had no flow. Sterling starting out wide is not good for us, and I was really expecting Markovic to have started at RWB with Lallana on the bench. I mean, I didn't really see anything positive of the 1st half from us, and it was just a disappointing half, with a lot of questionable calls. Beginning of the second half, we all know what happened; I'm beyond disappointed in Steven, and hope as many are saying, that Henderson absolutely rips into him back in the dressing room. However, we weren't doing well even before the stamp. What his stamp did do though is ensure we were on the back foot for the rest of the match, and the attacking play we did get in was impressive. 

Alas, I think, too little too late in the end. Side didn't start off playing for a win and unfortunately United showed that they're able to squeeze yet another ugly win out. Eight matches left, though, and we're still in great form. United can choke and we can keep marching on. Onwards to 4th.

Red card, penalty, all yellows were perfectly justified. Arguably could've dished out a couple more but on either side and if he'd gone mad with the cards people would blame him for losing control of the match. He can't win.

We were beaten by a stupid decision in the end and it's the most disappointed I've been by Gerrard in a long long time. Petulant and stupid. Otherwise, I thought we were perfectly able to break down United's system like we managed at Swansea by bypassing the block of 6 that were crowding the midfield.

Moreno was very very poor but it was because he was left so stranded on that left wing against Valencia, Mata and one other for the whole first half. Can got dragged right by Fellaini and Blind so Skrtel and Sakho had to follow or there would've been gaps through the middle. In the end the gap was between Sakho and Moreno and it got exploited twice.

Sterling was completely ineffective mainly due to being pushed so far back but was also poor when he got the chance going forward. Sturridge was largely poor too and Balotelli offered very little extra except for unnecessary further aggression and had me worried at times that he'd be sent off as well.

Henderson, Skrtel, Sakho and Mignolet (bar a couple of moments of over confidence) were great but their good individual performances were at the expense of the whole back line's performance because of the gap they left between themselves and Moreno.

Overall, not much more to say; we lost and we deserved to lose because United hit form and outdid us in most positions, we suffered from a lack of discipline.

I'm believe all religion is dangerous, as it's based on an inherent threat based on controlling folk with the promise, or denial, of typically a place in their dead heaven. 

The Catholic church is very good at changing it's outlook having inflicted great damage, the concept of limbo, support for fascism, denial of human rights, covering up systematic child abuse, etc. Similar harmful concepts and practices continue to this day.

This is my point. Having controlled nations and peoples for centuries with quite vile and cruel concepts most european religions stand discredited and lack followers. We have moved beyond that, and rightly so. Thus to suddenly have a new strain of this, in this case in the shape of Islam, is a step backwards.

In general Liverpool were shit in the first half, they picked up in the last 5-10 minutes but before that they were terrible: nervy in possession and giving it away too easily, they couldn't get the ball off United who were dominating possession.

I know Gerrard is Gerrard and he has been a fantastic servant but I don't give a shit, that wasn't funny, that wasn't passionate and that wasn't necessary. That was the action of absolute fucking imbecile who didn't deserve to wear the armband for the 40 seconds he did today, he wasn't thinking at all. You might expect a moronic 18 year old to do that, not a veteran captain brought on in an important game.

Liverpool actually played decently when they were down to 10 men, they took more risks and sterling actually did something sometimes. Everybody gave their all in this game which was fantastic to see.

The referee made some big mistakes in my eyes, the Jones' tackle on Lallana is a yellow, they are both going for the ball but that is far too aggressive. I however, don't think the Jones tackle on Henderson warranted a red, it was late and a bit high but I don't think there was any malice, it was just a poor challenge. How the Di Maria handball is not a yellow I don't understand, he fucking caught the ball on the pitch, that is retarded. Rooney probably should have gotten a yellow for the slip kick on Mignolet.

Finally, as satisfying as the stamp on De Gea was from Skrtel, that's not right and could have and should have easily been a red.

All in all, an incredibly frustrating game, an incredibly disappointing game for what it could have been, and an incredibly tense game, I was on the verge of spontaneously combusting for 90 minutes.

I thought Rodgers got the sub at half time right as Lallana was piss poor all half but in this season's biggest WTF moment our talisman, our leader, our demi-god absolutely shit himself and royally fucked us for the last 44 minutes of the match by stomping Herrera. Thought we played alright with ten men actually, Allen and Hendo saw more of the ball which let us see more positive play. Balotelli's introduction into the game proved to be positive. Was glad to see the Cou-Studge connection but it was clear we weren't going to get that second goal. United were the better side today, and deserved the three points.

Section 1. [**Pre-colonial India**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_history_of_India#Pre-colonial_India) of article  [**LGBT history of India**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT%20history%20of%20India): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;There are a numbers of ancient Indian texts which are relevant to modern [LGBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT) causes.

&gt;The [Arthasastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthasastra), an ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, mentions a wide variety of non-vaginal sexual practices which, whether performed with a man or a woman, were sought to be punished with the lowest grade of fine. While homosexual intercourse was not sanctioned, it was treated as a very minor offence, and several kinds of heterosexual intercourse were punished more severely. 

&gt;Sex between non-virgin women incurred a very small fine, while homosexual intercourse between men was sought to be censured by a prescription of a bath with one's clothes on, and a penance of ""eating the five products of the cow and keeping a one-night fast""- the penance being a replacement of the traditional concept of homosexual intercourse resulting in a loss of caste.

The few times we were actually able to string passes, we looked dangerous except on the final pass or finish. Gerrard slotted in the midfield in 2nd half would've been that key man to calm things down. Unfortunately that didn't happen

null,false,nicobadass,null,null,null,"These games are the makings of teams, the ones where you really get to see where the team is at. Thought they played their absolute heart out with ten men. Joe Allen, Coutinho, Sakho, Henderson, Skrtel, Can and Mignolet really stood up and we can now see the ""spine"" of our team. Special mention to Sturridge who I had questioned in the last few games as to whether he could recapture his good form. He was fantastic and led by example. Thought Sterling looked a little timid and always knew Mignolet was going to save that penalty. He was only beaten by two amazing goals.

I thought it was a fair result, they had us in the beginning of the game, we looked a little switched off. They've scored because Moreno was badly out of position. It's inexcusable as someone who has played at full back for most of his career but he's still young and can improve. We go one down and there was 10 minutes in that first half where we looked threatening but we didn't have enough players forward. It was also the fact that the scum got 10 players behind the ball.

Lallana is getting really unlucky, his career is reminding me of Harry Kewell's. I think we need to go try a diamond at some point to get him playing with more midfielders closer to him. His close control and short passing is incredible I'd like to see him in a midfield of Hendo, Allen, Lallana and Coutinho at the tip behind Sterling and Sturridge. He needed to bury that chance.

Really disappointed in Stevie, hopefully he isn't going to remembered by the way his career has ended. By far the most complete midfielder I've ever seen. Don't really need to say any more. He knows he's fucked up and I'm sure he's apologised. I was shocked Skrtel did that though.

The man down seemed to galvanise them which will no doubt be valuable experience if the team stays together. Our defence became a great force, I would be down with keeping Can back there if we stayed with the 3 at the back. Loved Skrtel on the wing getting in the game. 

Top 4 will be a stretch. This has shades of last season. I'm gutted but totally optimistic. We've got something good building here. I really hope Sterling stays and I still have no fucking clue about Balotelli.

1.) Sterling has been ineffective for a month. Giving away possession and adding very little going forward.


2.) Moreno got owned on both goals. They picked him out of the back four and both goals were a result of his confusion. 


3.) Gerrard playing for 32 seconds and going off for something stupid cost us dearly. He would've been huge for us down the stretch and yet he goes off for the dumbest possible reason. Really not a way to end his time with us. One of the best ever, but man so dumb. Especially with suspension likely. 


4.) This formation is not creating many or enough chances. I think we all know it but don't want to say it. We stuck with it because we were winning, but for the past near month now, we haven't been creating enough clear chances. I don't think anyone can say other wise.

I think its safe to assume that united were going try to exploit our midfield the same way Swansea did, so I dont get why we didnt adjust for that. I feel like sometimes Rogers persists with certain systems long after they've been figured out and I hope some changes are made before the Arsenal game.

Maybe a little bit of this:

                            Sturridge

                        Coutinho

                    Hendo        - Allen 

      Moreno -         Lucas            - Sterling 
         
                   Sakho   - Skrtel -   Can 
                
                            Mignolet

Maybe play Markovic instead of Moreno or Sterling?

Realistically to have any chance of making top 4, Utd need to lose to all three. We have a tough game against Arsenal away up next, and winning that (hell of a task) would reignite our chances.

On the game. Poor first half. Moreno was a real weak link and looked overawed, it wasn't just not tracking Mata into the box, it was poor passing, looking nervous in possession, disappointing game from him (he's been good recently though). Lallana's chance was massive, top players take those chances and make them pay.

Gerrard comes on, plays one brilliant cross-field pass, puts a blood and thunder challenge in, revs the team up and then does the most stupid thing he could've possibly done. Unnecessary, off-the-ball, zero cause. The stamp is unforgiveable, no excuses for it. From that point, the atmosphere was sucked out of the stadium, the second Mata goal was just world class, incredible technique. At that point, it felt like everything went wrong for us and everything went right for Utd. Phil Jones clumsily clattered into Henderson (?) and on another day, the ref might've tried to even things up and given him a red, but I think it was in between a yellow and a red. Probably a yellow card, but he should've been booked in the first half. Little things like that make it even worse.

Sakho was brilliant for us. Showed composure throughout the match and defended very well. Skinned a few Utd players and helped us build attacks (as he often does).

But still, could have had a draw. Lallana missed a golden chance, much easier than Mata's. And that's the difference in these tight games. For all their first half dominance united only had Mata's shot on target iirc,  could have matched it with Lallana.

* [Search for average cost of rent](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/) for housing in the area if you're planning on living within walking or bus distance. If it's a flat, and you're living alone with your own full-fitted kitchen, it'd be anywhere from £450-550m on average. Also depends if you want it furnished or unfurnished. 

* Then you have to check if the rent covers bills. Otherwise you'd be looking at another £60-100 p/m total on electricity, gas, water. 

* You'll also have phone and internet bills (another £20-40p/m). 

* Groceries is probably something like £20-40 p/w per person. So maybe £160 p/m.

* Gym memberships are usually £30 per month.

* Bus will be like £50-100 p/m if you don't get a season pass and you use it once every day, 5 days a week. 

* Then you'll be paying Council tax. As I'm a full-time student, I am exempt so I don't know how much it usually costs per quarter.

So you're looking at around so far at a worst case scenario of like £1,000 per month, not including entertainment, eating out, and alcohol which will add up probably like 100 per month.

Honestly, as bewildering as that was (and yes, it probably cost us the game), I'm starting to get really concerned about the level of play from Sterling. He's had a few brilliant stretches of play this year - remember after Brendan gave him his couple weeks in Jamaica? But recently, he seems to get completely lost during the course of the match. A few matches ago, maybe after that dreadful 0-0 against Bolton, someone described my feelings on Sterling perfectly. I'm paraphrasing, but they said something like ""I used to get up on the edge of my seat when the ball was at Raheem's feet. Not anymore."" That's exactly how I feel. 

I'm not trying to overreact, here. He's very young, and he's showed such promise over the last few years. He's pacey, athletic, skilled, shown he can score... I just wonder what's going on with him recently. Is it because he's not up top anymore now that Sturridge is back? Is it all this contract bullshit in his head?

ED: [Not to mention leaking the footage which this article claims](http://wideshut.co.uk/judge-concludes-hampstead-children-abused-mother-partner-satanic-cult/). That's child welfare, safeguarding, privacy. Highly irresponsible.

No the parent and partner led the conversations, any child psychologist would not be that verbally specific in coaxing descriptions from the children, alot would be implied.

Oh yea points that had been ""discussed"" off camera.

Sorry but you clearly have no experience OR  apparent interest in child welfare, it seems to me you're more interested in ""exposing the man"", then actually observing the worrying indicators of the children's behaviour.

&gt;Not all cases are the same, and this is no ordinary case.

Again sorry for your lack of interest in child welfare, but it is well established how a child begins to behave when they have encountered extreme abuse, and openly and articulately talking about it is not one aspect. It's far more indicative of coaching and coercion.

As someone who works in education, when I saw this video, it completely ran counter to what I had been trained in and I suspected coercion.

Sterling was playing out of position but it makes no sense to put him there then say 'well he's out of position' when he plays poorly. It was the same last week against Swansea, he needs to play but this formation isn't working for him and Sturridge. 

We need options and Johnson is the option right now, it doesn't make sense for a player to be guaranteed a starting spot no matter how bad they play.

When it comes to our own army, they can fuck off. According to the Greens our own army should be destroyed and replaced with a neutered Defence Force. But a brown skinned jihadist that rapes women and murders for sadistic pleasure, he should be given medical attention at all costs. 

After all, HUMAN RIGHTS!

I've said it before and I'll say it again. The modern left hate themselves, their own society, and their own country, and wish to see it destroyed. They enjoy being dominated and subjugated deep down. Their alleged support for noble causes such as gay rights and women's rights, extends only in so far as they can use them to demoralize the rest of their fellow population. Women's rights becomes radical feminists pushing to destroy the lives of men and humiliate them in the courts. Gay rights becomes teaching children the ins and outs of penetrative anal and oral sex. Human rights becomes giving medical attention to enemy combatants so they can resume their campaign of genocide, gang rape, pedophilia and murder. Wouldn't want them to be in pain of course.

They enjoy these campaigns of psychological warfare against society because they relish the notion of one day surrendering to total defeat and finally being dominated and subjugated, finally in the arms of a brutal dictatorial patriarch who will spank their botty and tell them what to do. That's why they love Islam. They don't admit this to themselves but deep down they want to be bent over the knee, and spanked. They love being told how evil they, their race, and their countrymen are. They crave nothing more than to submit and worship at the feet of the enemies of their own tribe, of anyone but themselves.

This has been going on for a long time. Just look at the traitorous scum in the 30s and 40s who signed up to be soviet spies. All leftists in their youth, all masochists. Philby, Burgess, Maclean - even that pretentious freak Anthony Blunt, whose public sympathies and hobbies (fine art, theatre, literature, dining), were completely alien to the soviet union, yet even he decided to join up and be part of the murderous grey monolith. The self hatred of the leftist has no limit.

I know a lot of people who think that ""well sooner or later, if the problems get too bad, the left will wake up and eventually join our side"". **No, they won't**. Even if their own family were raped and beheaded by ISIS, they would still rally against their own people. Nothing pleasures leftists more than to betray their own tribe.

null,false,Mutangw,null,null,null,"UKIP doesn't intend on demolishing our democracy and replacing it with a theocracy. A better comparison would be actual nazi parties, parties that think democracy is a blight on the landscape and should be replaced by a dictatorship. That is what Islamists believe, you don't elect God after all, he has a right to rule the entire world as far as they are concerned. In case you haven't noticed, the UK state has spent decades marginalizing fascist groups using legislation, the police and the intelligence services, many laws are in place which ban paramilitary groups and marches are restricted and monitored by the state at all times. The government also sends a lot of infiltrators into far-right groups in order to neuter them. That is why fascism is relatively weak in this country compared to much of the mainland. The same needs to be done with Islamists. 

Egypt got democracy (albeit a Turkish style one where the military keeps the elected officials in check) the Islamist party was swept into power despite previously promising that it wasn't interested in the presidency and that it was a moderate Muslim party. Once elected the Muslim Brotherhood spent their time fawning over social issues such as banning women from wearing bikini's at the beach and other measures to kill the tourism industry, which killed the economy further. 

Let's just put this into perspective. Mubarak got overthrown primarily because the economy went down the toilet and food prices were at all-time highs. The newly elected government then ruined the economy even more rather than actually fixing things, which destroyed its popularity within a year of it taking power.

Now the army which represents the elite business class and the moneyed interests has taken over again. Who's really to blame there? The military was never going to accept being shut out of power completely, the Islamists became too power hungry and didn't put enough attention into fixing the economic problems the country faced. 

The Arab Spring was a good opportunity for moderate Islam to present itself, for them to prove that Muslims can do religious inclusion, secular rule and fix their own problems. As it is right now the only success story is Tunisia. Libya is disintegrating despite constant hand-holding from the west.  

Islamists are inherently anti-democratic, therefore they have no place in a democracy. It's that simple. You can't elect a group of people that plan to literally abolish the very system that got them into power, it's lunacy and only ends in dictatorship.

I want to say ""utterly shocking"" , but is it? Is it?

The team is so lax at times, and it's been a flaw for years. It takes until the 80' mark for them to really start going for it if we are behind or level , and it's been my one true peeve for a very, very long time. The team always seems to believe that the goal will come and we will win...just because they wear the Chelsea jersey.

It's only when the final whistle approaches there seems to be a sense of urgency and hustle in our play. Because it occurs suddenly that...we might actually lose.

Somewhere along the way, the team developed this habit. We always play best when we're the underdogs. Barcelona? No problem. Messi? He still hasn't scored against us. And had we gone up against Barcelona instead if falling against PSG, I would have backed us to win it. Because we seem to thrive when everyone says ""chelsea are facing a difficult test today.""

If there's a 3 points we should be winning, somehow, it becomes the most difficult. I'd rather play Barcelona or city or arsenal today.

Fair play to Hull who smelled blood in the water. They're going for the kill. They see the 3 points and they're going for it. Cahill and Terry can't cope with the lofted balls and the pace. Ivanovic...sigh.

Hull may very well get them. And they'd deserve it. Because despite everyone saying Chelsea will run away with the points. Despite going down 2 goals in 10 minutes. They pressured, said fuck you and came out of the blocks and are working their asses off to get this win.

As to your point? 

Honestly, you're not completely wrong. The biggest problem with the (steadily more pronounced) ideological slant this place has developed over the past couple of months (particularly since its last major growth spurt) is the increased tendency towards kneejerk downvotes of minority opinions. 

We have no issue with minimal-effort comments, *so long as they contribute*. I think the quality is still reasonable at the moment as comments go, independent of votes- the issue lies in how things swing when fights break out. It's all terribly easy to toss abuse at someone from the comfort of a majority position- and it's absolutely not what we set this place up for. 

We try and step in and deal with it whenever we catch it - a few of us check the new comments queue at least twice a day. I can only speak for myself here, but I've had rather less time than I used to for the past month or two thanks to degree issues- this has, unfortunately, left the time gap between rows exploding (usually between a few otherwise decent usual sorts) and mod intervention to grow. We've added new moderators (the outstanding /u/tusksrus and /u/Zanza_N) to deal with things, and I think they've made a positive difference. 

The answer to your question might become a bit clearer by reference to the ruleset, though: 

&gt;**Effort Being Met with No Effort Is Bad**: If someone puts a lot of effort into a post or rebuttal, don't disregard it without good reason. Subject to context, of course- but do try and be sensible about it. If you've had your mind changed, or if you're done with the debate, do your peers the courtesy of saying as such.

We have no issue with top-level low effort posts, so long as they stay within the rules. The rule only comes into play when somebody's taken the time to put significant effort into a post, only to be met with ""well bah u sux tabloid dick k lel"". 

I don't think there's an issue with top-level comments- the broader issue lies in the disproportionate number of left-leaning posters. We've *absolutely no* issue with right-wingers joining the community- they're every bit as welcome as anyone else- but as long as the balance remains at its current level, of course left-leaning top-level comments will tend to outnumber right-leaning comments.",null,0,null,1427044903,moderator,0,false,0,cpn2pt1,null,t3_2zwyz6,null,t1_cpn2pt1,null,t3_2zwyz6,null,null,null,1431949932,null,7,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,7,null

null,false,Monztaa,lfc68,,null,"I actually disagree about the pressing in the first half. For some reason, we lacked the intensity that we do in many second half games. Look at the Swansea game previously. We were lacking massively in the first half and then with a tweak in midfield we can suddenly press effectively. And that's a key thing in a football match. Because when you are the underdog in a match, and the technical quality is higher than yours, the one thing that stands between them and a win is hard work. The ability to put pressure on the opponent and with intensity. When everything is against you, you can counter that with working really hard. (Which is why lots of big teams struggle with lots of Championship, League 1 and 2 teams, they treat it as a special occasion, a once in a lifetime opportunity and work their socks off whereas a lot of the big team's players are 'Meh' and hope that their technical quality and the fact that man for man they're better will see them through the game) But that requires great concentration and this is a trend that has been coming through recently and the very fact that it happened, at home, against Man Utd of all teams, suggests that they're becoming too relaxed. Sounds strange but I would actually change the formation a bit, make them focus on their game a bit more and concentrate a bit more. Perhaps also, as you've mentioned, they were overawed with the occasion and being a young team, didn't know how to get the win. You look at United, they have experience all over the pitch, from Rooney to Mata, Fellaini and Carrick. One problem that I thought we had was that we were scared of pressing in fear that we would concede another goal. Leaders solve that problem. We have a few, in Sakho, Skrtel, Lucas and Can but what can they do when they're playing in the back line?

 I agree that before, we couldn't seem to keep the ball properly and I think that our lack of intensity in the first half and the shape of our midfield was the cause of that. When we changed to a diamond at 40 mins or so, we actually kept the ball and found our feet. Then with Gerrard gone we were really up against it, for reasons both explained above. I think Gerrard saw the first half, saw how we had a lack of intensity in the first half and thought to make a statement in the second to tell his team mates and United that they won't get it so easy. He probably thought to lay down a marker, and maybe even get a yellow but what he did was very obvious and wrong.

Maybe we should get John Sitton to do our team talks.. :)",null,0,null,1427045157,null,0,1427045692,0,cpn2uqe,null,t3_2zw1ae,null,t1_cpn2uqe,null,t1_cpn2796,null,null,null,1431949997,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

Or Carra without his over-passionate recklessness. The same is true for so many great non-Liverpool players, from Zidane to Maradonna, to Cantona (seeing as we were against Man U), greatness often comes with an edge. That edge is part of their game and can't be separated out; calmed over time maybe, but not removed. Gerrard's tenacity is what made him one of the best players in the world, one of the best players in the history of this club, and one of the best English players to ever live. Some great players come with madness burning inside of them, and every match is a battle to harness it for good. Gerrard didn't get to start his last ever game against Utd. He was brought on as a sub at half time when we were a goal down. The passion, the anger, the hate, the adrenaline rushing through him - combined with the trigger of a reckless opposition challenge - brought out the monster he tries to control. It has been true all through his career, and it remains true now. Yes, be angry at him. Yes, be disappointed. But know that he will be more angry at himself and more disappointed in himself than any of you will ever be able to muster.

All the parties have at least some polices they've released and have communicated their general outline for the future. All parties have selected their candidates, their history, education and previous jobs will be mentioned. And in the case of the parties who have power see what they have done previously. 

I'm not voting labour this time but lets see, in their previous 13 year run they:

""the establishment of the national minimum wage, the devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the re-creation of a city-wide government body for London, the Greater London Authority, with its own elected-Mayor.""    

""A significant achievement of Blair's first term was the signing, on 10 April 1998, of the Belfast Agreement, generally known as the Good Friday Agreement. In the Good Friday Agreement, most Northern Irish political parties, together with the British and Irish Governments, agreed upon an ""exclusively peaceful and democratic"" framework for the governance of Northern Ireland and a new set of political institutions for the province.""

"" the age of consent for gay sex was equalised at 16 (see Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000) and the ban on gays in the armed forces was lifted. Subsequently, in 2005, a Civil Partnership Act came into effect, allowing gay couples to form legally recognised partnerships.""

So those are in my opinion positive things and give me the sense of what Labour stand for, now in exchange they went to war in Iraq and introduced tuition fees things I think are bad. 

http://www.labour.org.uk/issues

Now here they promise: 

""A Labour government will freeze gas and electricity bills until 2017""

""A Labour government will give 25 hours per week of free childcare to working parents with three and four-year-olds""

1. Good things happen when we get Hazard on the ball. In my opinion, the games where many have said he's gone missing are just the players trying to take advantage of space elsewhere when the opponents are trying to mark him out but there's no better way for us to assert our position on the game, whether it be early or if we are trying to win the tempo back, than by getting him the damn ball. 

2. Michael Oliver again had a good performance. Doesn't pay the typical player-bullshit any mind. Wish this didn't need to be made a point of but I am glad we got this refereeing performance rather than some of the others we have seen this weekend.

3. Am I crazy or are we unreasonably shit from corners? I remember thinking at the beginning of the season that with JT, Cahill, Brana, Matic and Costa in the box and people like Hazard and Cesc taking that we would be scoring one nearly every other game but we in general seem pretty underwhelming and non-threatening.

The thing with medieval titles is that a lot of time they were related to where that particular person had land or it is indeed simply a title. That said, Richard definitely had an affinity with the north. Part of his problem was he rewarded his northern supporters but just couldn't quite garner enough support from elsewhere. Anyway...

I believe the idea that he wanted to be buried in York is mostly speculation. If I recall correctly I think there were plans drawn up in his lifetime for a new chantry chapel at the Minster so it's generally assumed the chapel was for him. But we can't prove it. Also his son was presumed buried in a church in Fotheringhay but I remember speaking to the custodian in there years ago and he said there was nothing in there so in his opinion if it is a representation of Edward of Middleham it's just a cenotaph. Richard's wife Anne is in Westminster somewhere and very little survives about her. So we can't know if his plan was to originally bury her in York as well. If you died suddenly or far away from where you wanted to be buried then things became complicated. Preservation techniques were not what they are now.

Anyway, a combination of us just not being able to know for sure, plus Leicester being his resting place for over 500 years and also the university/city funding the dig means that it was decided that was where he'd stay. As much as there's a small part of me that would've loved to have him buried in York, I really can't argue with the logic used.

As well as being good for the Kurds (assuming that land was transferred to them by non-violent means), it would be good for the West too; the Kurdistan region politically crucially tends quite secular and left wing. One of the most popular political parties for Turkish Kurds, the Peoples' Democratic Party, has quotas that 50% of its candidates must be women, *and 10% must be LGBT.

Few thoughts:

-Kone is not good enough. Hope Naismith starts if Lukaku is out. We need another striker next year but it isn't a high priority compared ot other positions.
-Glad Lennon got the goal but I think he looks good because he plays very good defense and is always hustling but his offense contributions are not much. I think we need better if we want to be in Europe. Good squad player and a good option for a change of pace or tactical usage (shut down an aggressive winger/fb. He looks better because we have no other wingers. We will need two new ones of higher quality in the summer.
-I don't like the Gibson McCarthy partnership. I know people are swayed by his ability to pass the ball forward but he doesn't do enough on defense and his lack of harassment let QPR run the show in the first half. McCarthy did well being the one protecting the back four but he is better further up. I'd rather see Besic (used to play center half) as the one being more of a defensive destroyer.
-You can only get 30 good minutes out of Osman now.

Each course or module that a student passes is worth N ""points"", at the end of the degree course, all of the ""points"" are totalled and their grade is based on that.

Say, a student coasts through all of their courses with pass grades (around 40% for some degree courses). They can expect to get a 3rd class or ordinary degree (a degree without honours). But if they consistently get 60% or above then they can expect to get a 2:2 (second class lower), depending on the course and the way that grades are given out.

The further into a Bachelors degree, the more important each years grades become. For instance, you can pretty much write off the grades from your first year, but the final year is the most important.

However, all of this is caveated with ""your mileage may vary"" and each university, department and course are different. If you're at all worried then go speak to someone at your department.

Nasri, Toure, Džeko and Jovetic can leave in my opinion, they'd bring in quite a bit of money and drastically cut the wage bill (I know we don't need the money but 500+ K a week on players that are average 50% of the time is a bit of a piss take) again I'd go youth and bring in Lopes as a starter and maybe Pozo as 4th choice striker.

most of his performances have been better than the 80% of shit defensive games branna has.

&gt; Who scored the winning goal against Liverpool, a crucial away goal against PSG and the winning goal against Villa?

dont care not his job. you cant say that if he didnt score those goals that we wouldnt score later. and as good as these moments are his header against liverpool was unmarked and it was a perect cross. Winning goal against villa in 60/70 minutes you cant say that if he didnt score that that we wouldnt score later.

Im not deluded.

There are moral, blame free, ways to aid someone gradually out of obesity. I'm not sure why you think that would involve razing their houses. I was thinking more along the lines of intensive counselling, access to nutritionists, voluntary facilities that are conducive environment to weight loss etc. All expensive in the short term, but equally or more of a long term societal cost if not available. But big picture, these should not be forever necessary once we get our activity levels, diet, wider society, back in tune with consumption levels that don't reflect deeper problems.

we're not going to solve national policy in a reddit comment, but can't we come to an agreement on basic morals? isn't what is moral, that which benefits human health and human well being? if we can't agree, one or both of us is clearly wrong. we'll have to let evidence decide objectively which is which.

to address some of your other random points; modern ECT is very effective in dealing with things like depression, lots of scientific evidence to support that. If you've got some naive, turn of the century, torture scene in your head in regards to ECT, then you need to update your thinking. not ideal, but as a last resort it is perfectly moral, to remove children from the home, however temporary, if they are living in a shitty environment, it's not that hard to tell once you've seen both an extremely functional home and a vastly dysfunctional one. 

it is however, clearly immoral that people don't have ready access to the high quality, preventative education and care that would anticipate and prevent these extreme situations happening in the first place. that sort of committed solution is what really needs to be implemented, otherwise we're forever putting out fires. most social issues are all intricately intertwined with each other, they would all need to be gradually addressed on multiple fronts guided foremost by well conducted scientific research.

Completely false. They were average at best. He played well against fucking Derby though, I'll give you that. 

&gt; Im not deluded. Ivanovic's defensive performances go unnoticed to people like you with he attention span of a spoon that forget everything whenever he gets a goal.

I'm the one with the attention span of a spoon when you're the one saying Luis has performed *every match he played in*? One fucking good performance and all of the sudden Luis is a better fullback than Ivanovic? Holy shit. I usually agree with your posts on this sub, but this is ridiculous. 

&gt; Ivanovic's defensive performances go unnoticed to people like you with he attention span of a spoon that forget everything whenever he gets a goal. a lot of his mistakes go un noticed because they dont always lead to the other team scoring.

Im well aware of that. Im not saying he's a perfect defender ffs, im just saying its not like Luis is some magical answer to Ivanovic's problems.  I'll repeat for the 20th time. Luis has been given numerous chances to prove himself and he's looked weaker defensively, particularly against Pacey wingers. **Branislav** proved to be the better fullback, that's why he starts over Luis. For some reason you think Luis performed like this every game that he's played and its just wrong. 

&gt; Luis should be left back and Dave is better than Ivanovic thats how will be playing RB

Im not arguing against this. I even said he should start next game because he performed better that Ivanovic today. No shit Dave is better than Ivanovic, he's our best fullback.

In the first place, hasn't he been facing competition throughout his career? Hasn't he demonstrated the fact that is a naturally self-motivated, competitive person simply by virtue of having made a career as a professional footballer without immense natural talents? It's not like he's Messi out there and he can just bust moves on people at will. He's a guy who has *enough* natural talent and physical ability that he's managed to develop into a good player, but for every Danny Rose there are a thousand other young players with the same skill set that don't have his drive and ambition. We just never see them. So, the very fact that he's where he is suggests to me that he's unlikely to simply stop trying to improve himself, which is the unstated implication of your competition idea.

Beyond the whole competition thing, he has Pochettino working with him, a coach who is renowned for developing young players; we know that he has a history of improving players by the performance of so many players at Southampton last year. Plus, Rose is himself older and more experienced. Defending is something that takes experience to really master, and in nearly every sport defenders take longer to fully mature and reach their peak. It makes sense that Rose would continue to improve that element of his game as he ages and gains experience. Finally, last season Rose had a string of injuries that meant that simply being fully match fit was a challenge. He missed substantial portions of the season, making it difficult to find a rhythm and really develop his skills. It makes sense that with a long run of matches in a settled situation, his performances would improve.

For all those reasons, I find the notion of competition utterly unconvincing. It rests on very shaky premises, and there are many counter examples (for example Kane, as noted above, has no competition and continues to improve while Walker's ""competition"" was Naughton, an obvious second choice). Overall, there are much better and more specific explanations for Rose's improvement than the facile ""competition"" explanation. I get that the idea that competition is a universal good is deeply embedded in the Anglo-American psyche as a result of our long experience with a market-based society, but it's clearly wrong on closer examination. Suggesting that Rose has just now *decided* that he should win headers and make better tackles is ridiculous. It ignores the broader context of Rose's career, the team, and the manager in favor of a blanket and uncritical endorsement of Victorian political economy and its current iteration.

Difficult to say if you played better with 10 men considering how short Gerrard was on, I think it was a case of regrouping at the break and coming out stronger. 

Coutinho is a scary talent, and I'd say you need to build around him a little more, possibly provide a 'destroyer' type in the center to win the ball and get it to him higher up. (Can is good at this, and I'll talk about him later).

Got to be honest, I still don't see it with Sterling. He's clearly good, but I'm still not convinced that he's the 'one' to depend upon down the line, and would say that you need to be looking to Coutinho and Sturridge in that sense. Certainly don't think the boy is worth £150k a week (I doubt he really has asked for that though, bare in mind the media always inflates these numbers).

Sakho is a monster in the air for you, would have loved to see him and Fellaini tangle more, just to see who would come out on top more often.

I used to live in Germany, so saw a lot of Can at Leverkusen. He's not a wing back/right back by any means, and I think he was destroyed by Blind today. However, he is a great central mid, and would be interested to hear your thoughts on him there from what you've seen of him?

Moreno has been caught out twice today, and have to say that he's not tracked Mata well, but I did think he was very isolated at times. He can't really be expected to cover both Mata, whilst Valencia bombs forward. 

Cracking save from Mignolet on the pen. I think Skrtel knew exactly what he was doing when he stamped on De Gea too, not sure if the FA will take action or not, the ref whistles at the end were confusing as to whether he blew up for it and then full time, or just missed it altogether, we'll likely know more tomorrow.

Finally, and what it's worth, I'm a little sorry as a football fan to see Gerrard's behaviour. As much as I'm glad he's never won the league, it does feel as though a chapter of the derby has closed today as the guard changes again, and I think Gerrard has let us all down a bit.",null,0,null,1427049232,null,0,false,0,cpn51lt,null,t3_2zwvdp,null,t1_cpn51lt,null,t3_2zwvdp,null,null,null,1431951029,null,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7,null

And yes, visa requirements are tough. I came here from the states on a student visa and at the time, there was an option for a two year work visa, which they have now closed. Essentially, you're competing with a lot of people from the UK and EU who don't require sponsorship from employers. Many companies are reluctant to hire non-EU candidates because they're not familiar with the process, risks and fees, and there are often plenty of other applicants for many jobs. Some jobs are more used to this or actually seek people with specific passports, say if they need people to travel to Canada for business. But I'll be honest, it's difficult unless you have a job offer before you go, or some kind of visa or work permit.

Possible downsides:

* Massively increased workload for the conductors if everyone does this
* Conductors might not be able to get to everyone between stations, and would probably miss a few people, who could then get caught by barriers (but if we're doing this anyway, why not give staff at the other end the option to print your tickets?)

I've never rated Kolarov or Clichy and see them as a bit of a liability when I see them on the team sheet. Sagna too, actually. They seem too reactionary and struggle to read a game properly the way Milner, Zabaleta or Kompany do.

Speaking of Kompany, some of his post-match interviews have been, well, confusing. I'm not sure what's going on, but he's either trying to make excuses as captain for sub-par performances of his team mates or he is a bit thick. I hope it's the former, but he needs to be more honest with himself and his team, or give over the arm band to somebody who can tell it as it is.

Dzeko, Demichelis and Nasri all seem to have good and bad days but I think they get too harsh a treatment from most.

For the money he's asking for, letting Milner go is utter stupidity, especially given our ageing squad and his complete all round ability, we should give him frankly anything he asks for.

To be honest, it doesn't really. Yeah, you can use a snazzy template but really it just takes a fair bit of effort and multitasking and occasionally battling Reddit's tendency to repeal edits. So long as you've got two screens to keep the match thread properly up to date while still actually paying attention to the game, I'd say that's about all you need. 

If you have RES you can go to any old match thread and steal the formatting (or at least use it to learn how things are done). If you feel bad taking someone else's format without permission, then [here's mine](http://pastebin.com/Rr3k59di) that I consider free for anyone to use.  I also have [this one](http://pastebin.com/53gcjMfj) but I don't know whose it is originally. 

I don't think trying to sort things ahead of time would be a great way of doing it, because I think that places too much focus on *who* does it, and risks just causing tension between people who want to do it.

null,false,LynchLaw,null,null,null,"I disagree I believe Rodgers got the tactics wrong from the start today.  He played exactly the same team as the Swansea game and we were really exposed again. He should've known that LVG would have been watching videos of that game and setting up to exploit us if we played the same team which we dutifully did. Moreno should not have been on the pitch after a half hour, I know people will say it would've shot his confidence taking him off but honestly we have no time for sentimentality in that fixture and with so much at stake. Sterling at RWB was completely ineffective. Another mistake by Rodgers. There is no indication that Sterling is effective there and actually quite a lot of evidence that he is detrimental to the team when he plays there. I would have rather seen him playing with Studge up front to give a bit of movement and energy to our attack. But I could've forgiven it all if he didn't pull out of that tackle with Blind, that's completely unacceptable at this level.  The pressing in the first half was shocking also, non existent most of the time. Fellaini really bullied us as much as we take the piss with their long balls they were very effective. I thought the Gerrard substitution was good he would've added some experience and a bit of fight to that team which was sorely lacking in the first half. I'm sorry but Lallana never was or shall be a £25 million player no offence to him and it's not his fault for the price tag but missing that chance from ten yards is unforgivable in that situation. We were getting hammered before that and a goal could have really been what we needed. I'm not going to comment on the red card it is what it is. After that we played some good football and got a goal but never really looked like coming back. Good finish from Sturridge but he's still *way* too selfish and doesn't press nearly enough. The loss of Suarez has affected him a lot more than I thought it would unfortunately.

In all I think the thing I'm most disappointed with about today is the fact that it wasn't Gerrard that cost us top four or the level the players played at (which was undoubtedly below par) it's Rodgers. The fact is that if we hadn't been in such poor form before Christmas we could've lost this game and still got top four! Rodgers made me love him last season by being able to adapt to what we were up against but for six months he completely lost his ability to do that. He became stubborn and ridged and we suffered terribly because of it. I know Rodgers is better than that, shit he's shown it over the past couple of months and and the phenomenal season last year but for those six months we just lost it completely and it frustrates me so much. If the Mancs do end up getting top four which looks most likely it, they have the money and clout to buy up world class players. Chelsea and Man City will always have the money to buy their way to top four and Arsenal seem to get it every year regardless. We, unfortunately do not have that ability. Really this was the year we *needed* top four and it annoys me that six months in which Rodgers managed the team poorly will cost us so much but the worst thing *by far* is knowing how much better he is than that.

At a 9%/year return for 55 months, I would expect a return of 1.09^(55/12) = 1.48 (+48%), which is more than the 25% that's paid at the end. Conversely if I were starting with the 25% and trying to calculate an annual ROI before adding the effect of interest paid along the way, I'd be splitting that 25% over ~5 years of saving and arriving at a figure in the vicinity of 5%/year (although not exactly since 55 months is less than 5 years, and then there's a small adjustment to be made to account for the effect of compounding)

So... what am I missing?

Edit: Wait, is it the result of incrementally building up your deposit, with the 9%/year only applying to the portion you've managed to actually put in... which would mean the overall return is about half of what it would have been for a full upfront lump, and would cut that 48% I calculated before down to ~24% (close enough to 25% that I'm pretty highly suspicious that this is the explanation I was looking for)",null,0,null,1427054070,null,0,1427054314,0,cpn7ltp,null,t3_2zwfut,null,t1_cpn7ltp,null,t3_2zwfut,null,null,null,1431952306,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

**Product claims:** *""New Baby Lips lip balm from Maybelline New York gives intense care and 8 hour hydration, and is nourishing for baby soft lips. Its clinically tested formula has SPF 20 to leave lips feeling soft, conditioned and cared for.""*

Same claims for the entire range.

**About you:** Compulsive lip biter/picker, frequently chapped lips from dehydration.

**Your opinion:** SPF protection-wise the packaging is even worse than the Vaseline or Nivea lip balm, the cap is transparent so the UV filters could be considered just fillers.

As a lip balm it has a light unobtrusive fragrance, is light weight and goes on very nicely but due to my fussy skin doesn't do much in terms of moisturisation.
