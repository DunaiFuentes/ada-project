It is not clear from your post whether the agreement has existed when your friend moved in last year, or starts when you move in now. There may be additional wording in the agreement regarding pests specifically, be sure to check.

Has the landlord been informed about these bugs - what actions have they taken thus far? If they have been both informed and have done nothing, you may have room to terminate.

If the property is infested *prior* to moving in. You have the ability not only to declare the tenancy invalid, but to also sue the landlord for damages. As per Smith v Marrable (concerning rats). However case law for beg bugs specifically, unfortunately does not exist. So expect such a route to be met with ferocious financial threats and legal challenge. But if you do want to go that route, video/picture evidence of infestation will be vital. As will written statements from previous tenants.

Where a thousand year old dynasty the Plantageants ( targaryeans) were overthrow n leading to a 20-39 year war over the thrown between the Lancaster's (very subtle George) and the York's (Starks). So a lot of his history is loosley based off reality.

However my favorite things about his world and these books is the lack of good and evil. He is quoted as saying JRR Tolkien was a genius and an inspiration. But that he disliked how his worlds were so black and white. Men, elves, dwarves were good. Orcs, goblins, Sauron were bad. He said that is not how real life is. So his books you start out hating certain people. But as it moves along you realize everyone has their own motivations and they are not necessarily evil. And although they may be wrong you could see yourself carrying out the acts in the same situation. In my opinion as a Star Wars geek and Lprd of the Rings fanboy.

to be honest if you'd done a bit of research into it yourself you probably could have found this out and you should have before making the decision to drop out of a degree. 

&gt;They wouldn't let me pay for the final year, because 'working to pay the debt would disrupt my studies and likely result in failure' (actual quote). So instead of having two years to save up, I had zero time, and no-one to borrow from. I worked four jobs for the time I had to get the money together.

This makes a lot of sense to me actually and even if it didn't I doubt you had zero time, even the student loans company pays your fees in instalments over the course of the year and I'm sure you could have come up with a payment plane with the university (as I had to do for my MRes).

*

The law states that any IP created by an employee in the course of their employment is automatically the employer's (I assume you will be an employee not a contractor). So even if your contract said nothing at all that would still be the case. However, ""in the course of employment"" does not mean any time you were employed - it means if you were doing what you did in furtherance of your general duties or as a result of being specifically asked by your employer. This does mean that stuff done in out of office hours can potentially be caught - being on company time or in the company building is not the defining feature under the law.
Example 1 - you are a software programmer. You go home and work on your own software project (especially if the subject matter is similar to what you do at work). There would be a risk that IP would go to your employer.
Example 2 - you are a software programmer and you go home and write a novel. This is totally unrelated to your job so remains your own property.

*

The key line in your agreement is the one about ""normal duties"" or ""specifically requested"" - which means it looks like it is mirroring the law anyway. I agree the extra bit about ""adapting"" is confusing, but arguably what can be adapted for the company is related to your employment anyway? Just ask them if in doubt but if it tries to catch too much (eg you example 2 above) it is arguably very unfair and potentially unenforceable. 

So this does not mean that anything in your free time is totally safe as explained above - basically *what* you are doing is more important than *when* and *where* (and the agreement even says that).

Ultimately, if you do anything at home that is similar to what you do at work (or uses the same skills) and you are about the ownership then run it past your boss (in an email) first.

&gt; George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer and the architect of the government’s austerity policies, announced his intention to make these policies permanent. Britain, he said, should have a law requiring that the government run a budget surplus — with current revenue paying for all spending, including investment outlays — when the economy is growing.

null,false,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,null,"Was gonna do a more in-depth analysis like I did for Guzan, but it's a lot harder to judge with defenders.

I noticed that when filtering by the number of games, Okore appears near the bottom end no matter what (largely because he only played 23 games) and I'm wary of extrapolating too far based on his actual numbers. I'll take a look again later maybe. 

I did manage to arrange by Squawka's performance scores though, per 90 minutes... interesting outcome, [take a look](http://i.imgur.com/XzqLYjb.png). By itself, this performance score doesn't really tell us much... but he's in good company, I reckon.

I applied the ""per 90"" modifier to all stats and had a quick gander at stats people seem to be mentioning a lot here... any ranks mentioned below are out of 91 unless stated otherwise.

* won 47 aerial duels (56% success)    
solid if unspectacular. can't sort by success rate so it's hard to see how he stacks up in terms of aerial dominance. numbers wise, 2.1 successful aerial duels per 90 ranks him near the middle (of all defenders playing 20 games or more). perhaps not as good/bad in the air as some might think.

* 0.09 defensive errors per 90 (none of which led to goals, apparently)    
one every ten games. immediate thought is ""can't knock it, given his age"" ...when adjusting to only include under 24s, he ranks 5th though, so it suggests he is perhaps a little more error prone than his peers, age-wise. on the flipside, no goals as a result of them so... not so bad. again, good observation from whoever pointed out his errors.

* 2.96 interceptions per game    
ranks 12th. impressive. definitely his strongest point when it comes to defensive actions (he ranks 30th and 35th for clearances and blocked shots). ranks favourably with the league leader in this area (koscielny, 3.66 per game). good observation, whoever said that.

**TL;DR version:** Okore seems a little more error prone than expected for a player in his age group, but makes up for it with a good rate of interceptions. His aerial duel success rate is also a little below average it would seem, and among the lowest for Villa defenders, which is a little concerning in a way. Overall, he's perhaps progressing slightly behind what you'd expect for a centre back his age, though it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that is due to time lost through injury. There were 18 defenders aged 24 or under who played 20+ games last season, and Squawka ranks Okore 4th overall... so despite seeming a little behind the curve compared to other young defenders, he's still fairly promising. I'd grade him a B-, personally. He compared favourably with some pretty experienced players in some areas.",null,0,null,1434118638,null,0,1434119029,0,cs488bl,null,t3_39k1sj,null,t1_cs488bl,null,t3_39k1sj,null,null,null,1436938507,null,3,false,avfc,t5_2s569,3,null

&gt;At one time, people who considered such matters were convinced that the world was a flat disk and that over the edges ""there dragons be."" 

&gt; In psychologist Robert Cialdini's discussion of the six principles of persuasion, he mentions commitment and consistency. People can, it appears, be easily coerced to commit themselves to a task or cause. His exemplars are California homeowners, unwitting participants in a psychological test, who were each asked to place a massive ""Drive Safely"" sign on their lawns. Some residents (Group A) had been approached weeks before by a researcher who asked that they display a tiny public safety sign while others (Group B) had not. In Group A, half agreed to virtually obscure their houses with a huge eyesore; nearly none of Group B agreed to the request. Cialdini points out that by making the commitment to the small sign, those in Group A amended their images of themselves to include ""community spirited.""
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly, the British populace has been asked by the Conservative Party to sacrifice in service of a greater good (or so the story goes). Having begun down that path, convincing themselves that even if the country is in desperate shape they're doing this for their children and grandchildren, the voters are likely to become more rather than less committed as things continue to deteriorate.

This isn't semantics. He isn't making money from the public services. He would make the same money from the same job irrespective of the protection.

The issue is that the service is being offered and that he is taking it up. But your beef isn't with him who uses the service, it is with the government that allows this to happen.

null,false,FezojT,null,null,null,"This is purely hearsay, I don't personally know anybody who works at Aldi so make of it what you will. I'm at uni and Aldi pay silly amounts for their grad schemes, so I know people who know people who went for it, and apparently it's awful. You get paid a lot because they work you hard, you get a lot of hours and more responsibilities than are easily manageable. Regarding physical fitness, I think as a store manager you're a full member of the team, so you have to stack the shelves, work the tills etc. whilst delegating to everyone else (and if you've ever been to an Aldi you'll see they do it pretty furiously. You can definitely tell they're under a lot of time pressure/stress).

As I understand it there isn't much opportunity for upwards progression from the store manager part of the business and a lot of people wear out eventually and look for something else, but tend to find that hard to do because you 1) have no skill or vocation, and 2) only get to put down on your CV that you were an Aldi store manager, which I don't think does the job justice and doesn't make enough of an impression with new employers. I don't think they make many concessions to retain you either, since there's always a fresh pool of new graduates going after the high salary. 

I personally would avoid it because I couldn't see myself doing it long term and it's not something that I would enjoy doing. It sounds horrifically stressful, and while I would like the money, I think I would want to move onto something a bit more peaceful after a few years. The problem being that it's probably hard to get into another line of work after being a supermarket manager. That said, if you could see yourself doing it long term you will be really quite wealthy.

Similarly withdrawal can be done by selling your parts which is associated with fees and possibly discounts to make sure you get a sale which will add up, could be costing you a few percent. Better is to simply draw out money as it comes in. 10k at 6% over 5  years should be putting about £200 into your account each month, so would allow you to draw out at that rate.

null,false,henleyregatta,hampshire,Hampshire,null,"Depends, as always, on your budget. If you're not prepared to spend the £3-400 required to get started with a DSLR kit, then I'd stick with the ""Bridge"" cameras like you've currently got. You're not missing out on megapixels or ability to take good photos with these, you're really only missing out on flexibility (ability to change lenses) and some performance (DSLRs tend to be a lot quicker to wake up, take a shot, and take a bunch of shots in sequence than anything else. Some ""Bridges"" come close nowadays, but that's what you're missing out on, not size of photos). 

You have many options, but I'd simplify things and look at the Nikon or Canon lines of DSLR. People form rabid devotions to one or the other (not least of all because it's hard to switch accessories so your first purchase tends to lock you in to one or the other). Other suppliers are available; Pentax and Sony have decent followings, for example, but Canon and Nikon are the two biggest players.

This explains why I'll only now talk Canon ;-)

First point to make is that you need to divorce the camera from the lens in your mind - within a manufacturer there's normally a way to make any lens fit any camera. Many people would tell you to focus on getting a good Lens sorted first; I don't think that's realistic.

Canon DSLRs can be differentiated at any given point by counting the number of digits in the model. The fewer the digits, the more expensive the camera. The entry-level DSLR is currently the EOS 1200D. It's a good camera.. The next step up is the 700D, that's also a very good camera. Then you go into their ""Enthusiast"" range, with a 70D. I doubt you'll get there, but the ""Professional"" tier is a 7D. It's very expensive indeed.

But consider the lens: To start with, you'll buy a kit of camera+lens. This will get you going nicely. If you start paying attention and getting away from all the auto-modes, at some point you'll get fed up with the lens (kit lenses tend to be restricted in aperture and focal length; one of these facts will frustrate you before too long). Here comes the rabbit hole, because you can spend *serious* wonga on a decent lens (Canon's USM professional lenses can be several thousand pounds each, for example), and if you do you'll end up getting frustrated with the camera... so you'll hanker after the next one up, which will eventually show up limitations in the lens...

...Anyway, I jumped off that particular treadmill by accepting that I'd reached my personal limits of artistic ability and composition, and no matter how much I spent, I'd never take great photos.

All this is a bunch of screed to justify the following tl;dr advice:

  * Research the range of accessories and lenses you think you might be interested in first. Use that to select a manufacturer
  * Get the one-from-bottom of their range (so a Canon 700D, or Nikon 5500) as a Kit with a starter lens. 
  * Use it. Try and get comfortable going outside full-auto modes to compose shots.
  * Identify what you're unable to do in terms of framing or composing a shot and use that to drive what sort of Lens you should go for.
  * And if you hit the limits of the camera, don't forget you can trade it in and keep the lenses, which minimises the pain somewhat.

Therefore they were fans of American football, baseball, basketball and that's what they shared with their kids. We could always catch a game of any of those sports on cable whenever we wanted. You can't with the MLS, even now.

However, not supporting the MLS because of poor quality is an elitist statement. Any league will give you moments of brilliance and stretches of boredom. It might be hard to catch to catch MLS on TV (usually you're stuck with a shit stream), but attending games is a lot easier and cheaper. As more teams get soccer specific stadiums, the atmosphere gets better and it's really fun to experience. I'm not able to make many games (~4 hours one way), but I try to get there at least a couple times a season.

yes it was, ridiculous that he was taken seriously by anyone. 

He didnt include any costs of travelling to and from the airports at all, nor account for the time taken, or the fact that just because a flight at £25 quid is advertised doesn't mean you can get it at that every day (seriously, try it, you usually get 1 or two very awkward times at that prices and the rest can be anything up to 5 or 6 times higher). Nevermind that the cheap flights are often late at night, so his commuting would see him at work 8 hours too early a day. 

if he'd actually done it based on flights *arriving in time for work* and *leaving after* going home and included travel costs, he'd have quickly found it didn't work out and to do it he'd have 3hrs sleep a night, but that required actual effort, not pandering to a narrative.

But I can shoot photos in low light with my Sigma 18-35 1.8 lens, which was half the cost of my 7D. I can do handheld night shots with it that dont need a tripod because it's so fast.


the body upgrades are really really unimportant. Focus on glass first.

Many people I know have done this just fine and not only at my university, a friend of mine is an Oxford law graduate and he worked one day a week in a bar and was also a first VIII rower for his college. Similarly another friend of mine is now a dental student at Kings, also rows and works 2 or 3 nights a week. 

I'm not saying its an ideal situation but it is definately doable and is by no means a reason to complain you aren't getting enough free money.

Generally, you aim to limit your disclosure only to things which are absolutely required. No lawyer worth their salt is going to advise that any party (whether the government or an individual defendant) should offer up documents it doesn't need to disclose unless there is a very good reason to do so. 

This is why I am saying that take my comment with a grain of salt - I don't know how disclosure works in data protection cases since that's not my field. But if I am understanding the article correctly, if a prosecution team can provide sufficient evidence without relying on intercepted data then it is understandable that they do so and avoid the high cost and time involved in a wider disclosure exercise (in theory, the rationale behind this is good - less taxpayer money spent on the case, more time devoted to other case work). 

If intercepted data doesn't form part of the prosecution's case then why does a defendant need it? If it's the defendant's intercepted data then they should have access to their own data anyway. But if some third party's data formed part of the investigation, I can see the argument for requiring full disclosure of intercepted data. Like I said, I don't know in what context the government put forward this response or how these cases work in practice. 

Edit: in short, I think the government's response was intended to say that they don't want to enable a defendant to go on a fishing expedition (arguably rightly so but I'm not well versed in this area of law) so I think it is sensationalist for the article to say that the intention is to prevent a defendant from establishing their innocence.

Well. I was thinking about this and I suspect the reason I was so aware of it was because I was living in the complex with a load of other brits, and the local newsagent used to get the Sun and a few other British newspapers/magazines in for us. So yeah...Everyday my dad would collect the morning newspaper (which was always a few days out of date) and page 3 and every other bit of nakedness was scrubbed out by the newsagent. 

But I suspect, unless you live in a similar situation you might never come across it. And by that I mean the local press know the rules and there's simply no need to scrub anything out.

Anyway, no biggie


&gt;However, I think it's getting a lot better. Malaysian youths are a lot more open to skin, and there's been a surge in feminism/encouraging girls to dress how they want in malaysian social media.

The 700D should be an excellent choice; I've got a 600D (the earlier model) and I've had sterling service. As I said before, it's enough of a camera to convince me I shouldn't be spending any more time on the get-more-gear ladder and instead concentrate on actually developing skills. 

My interests drove me to supplement the kit 18/55mm lens with a separate Zoom (the cheapest - 55-200mm), because aeroplanes are hard to fill the frame with on a small lens. If the kit 18-135 had been available when I bought I doubt I'd have needed the bigger lens.

For the sorts of photography you're doing, especially if you're going to try night/dusk, you *may* find yourself, down the road, wanting something with a bigger aperture (e.g. f/1.8) rather than longer focal length, but you're absolutely right that this isn't something you need to get started. 

Standard recommendation is to fit a UV filter to the front of every lens you own regardless; as much to protect the expensive lens glass as for the slight benefits to quality the filter gives; you can screw additional filters on top if you want to try that out (they're a fairly cheap way of pimping your experience!). 

The only recommendation I'd make to supplement a basic kit is to splurge for a couple of extra batteries when you buy.

null,false,LukeeT,null,null,null,"Firstly, I may as well start by saying I am a “genuine” Chelsea fan as my Dad has been for 40years+ but I have no idea why it would ever fucking matter.  

Your question states ""from the same club"" and to be honest with you, unless your an overseas supporter that changes clubs frequently, I really don’t see why on earth anyone would dislike a fellow fan simply because they are not English. I’m not sure if you’re talking about Chelsea specifically, however, for us to be a big club in the modern day that challenges for the title every year and (for example) competes with Real Madrid for Pogba's signature, we BLOODY WELL need American fans. Any fans for that matter. I don’t have stats to back me but taking a look at English supporters in general and the population of pure-bred Chelsea fans in London, shirt sales etc are not going to be making the billion revenue Man Utd were recently confirmed to have achieved. We need fans to grow. We need foreign fans to grow.  

The arguments I have seen on hear offer a good insight as to why you might get annoyed at American fans, for instance: it causing us “genuines” to be called glory hunters, or American fans not understanding the atmosphere, Americans not understanding the importance of football and your team in social situations (tried to avoid the term banter). But to me it doesn't really matter. Im 21, meaning to a friend or bloke at the bar I’m inexplicably debating with about football, I probably started liking football around Roman’s uprising. This means for a petty argument exchange I’m automatically a glory-hunter. And for me, any Arsenal fan my age or above is probably a glory-hunter after watching the Invincibles, I’m also Southern so all the United fans can fuck off with the “my Dad’s from Manchester” line they are glory-hunters, no one supports City but if I met them they are gloryhunter too. For me the gloryhunter word is obsolete as it is used on both the deserved and the undeserved, additionally, why should new supporters not choose the team their favourite players play for, or the teams that are on the TV the most. You won’t be a football fan long if you choose Hull City for fuck sake with no roots connecting you. As for the hating American fans for not understanding atmosphere/importance of football, that’s just part of the fun, having different fans seeing the club differently.
I’m not even a Potter fan, but it weirds me out drawing similarities between Pure-Bloods (3rd Generation Plymouth Argyle Season Ticket Holders), Half-Bloods (Southern United Fans with an Uncle that lived in Bury) and Muggles (Americans) and how they view each other.  

I think this is stating the painfully obviously but others may feel differently, the ""hate American fans"" ideology is a reddit/internet creation. People confuse “hating American fans” with the horrific generalisation of “hating the way redditors on r/soccer (more often than they can be presumed to be American) argue”. Thread upon thread of shit jokes, shit downvoting and ridiculously biased opinions. People hate the American creation that is r/soccer rather than the fans of America themselves?

He'd be more in the Gerrard role, but I think he's much more reliable defensively than Gerrard was, but he'd still have freedom to play on both ends of the field a bit even if he's starting from very deep in midfield.  Can is obviously not on the same level as Gerrard in terms of his vision and distribution, but he's still no slouch at it. 

If it's not this formation though, where Hendo and Milner cover a ton of ground and help solidify the center very well, I think Can is going to be best suited to a box to box role so he can get about the pitch using his pace and physical power to impose himself.  He's prone to lapses in concentration too, so it's risky to rely on him as more of a traditional/pure DM.

EDIT: I also don't think Lallana, Markovic, and Ibe would be particularly starved for minutes.  Lallana can play for Coutinho, Milner, or Henderson.  Markovic has played as the CAM and as one of the strikers in the diamond before at Benfica, and Ibe can play as one of the strikers as well, IIRC he played as a striker a fair bit for the youth squads.  We can also use a sub like Ibe to change the shape and adapt to the game a bit if needed, it's good flexibility.  They're fantastic rotation options to come off the bench and start a fair amount of games as well as compete to cement themselves into the first 11 (I wouldn't be shocked to see some games with Milner as the base of the diamond with Hendo and Coutinho to either side and Lallana/Markovic in front of them).

Lovren on the other hand was bought to replace Sakho, a left sided defender. He will never be better than Sakho. I'd argue he's not even good enough for a backup. He's one of the worst defenders I've ever seen. He will go down as one of our all time worst signings. 

Lallana I'm unsure. He looks good on MOTD but watching over 90 mins he has looked poor. He's not fast enough to break with our team, instead of quick passes he likes to do 5-10 turns to get away from players. Hasn't provided any quality crosses.

Mirrors aren't required to pass MOT on a motorcycle. They aren't a legal requirement for a motorcycle. Legally they have to be fitted by the manufacturer under the construction and usage regs (if it is to be designated for road use) but you're not obliged to keep them. 

As for the lights, you can have an MOT with no lights. Often called a ""daytime only MOT"". There is only one MOT test / certification though. So you are correct that it would come up as an advisory. During daylight hours you're not obliged to have fitted any lamp. However I would recommend fitting a brake light, you might last longer out there with one! You're going to have to get familiar with hand signals and hope those around you are reasonably familiar with them. Also if you do get caught out at night you do run into the problem that not only is it ludicrously dangerous but you could get a £50 fine for every light you don't have, so that's tail, brake, four indicators, dipped beam, main beam.

When we signed him we were shit (we paid over the odds transfer and wages) but we've evolved and got better and he didn't. 
End of the day he was a backup player and only got a game when a first choice was out, nobody can honestly say otherwise.  
We can attract better players for lower wages so ask yourself if he was that good why wouldn't he be able to either command 1st team football with us or move to a top 4 team?

I got a response from the gentlemen who ran the club. It was lengthy and passionate. It laid out the reasons why Villa were an amazing club, and how long and proud their history was. I was really impressed. I went on some Villa fan forums, explained who I was and why I was there, and was welcomed with open arms.

Then MON was hired. He began building an exciting team and it didn't take long to fall in love with the Villa. It's been 9 years now, and I can say I'll support this club forever, in as much as I can from an ocean away.

Of the current generationI really like Westy and Grealish but I love Clark, his passion for the club in the last season has given me hope. There have been games this season when players haven't put any effort in, but he'd be running about getting stuck in and giving it all. I'll take his effort over talent any day, one thing is for sure, when he makes mistakes it isn't out of lack of effort.

I really do not mind if Soldado is sold because I would like the guy to have the opportunity to rekindle his career, and not end it as that guy that went to Spurs and hit the pavement.

That said, if we keep hold of him I think his attitude and the way he appears to conduct himself would bring immeasurable benefit to our younger players. 

As a mildly effective illustration, lets say Kane has a big dip in form next season, and shit is getting to him. If a senior player is supporting him, and that player is Soldado, then the lesson of the day is ""Go out and give it your all, and they will still support you and sing your name."" If the supporting senior player is Adebayor the lesson is ""money money money money....  moooooneeeey.""

Literal worst case scenario is that we end up holding onto a player who has a stellar attitude, conducts himself cleanly, and is a near perfect role model for younger players.

&gt;In September 2012, The Guardian reported that Al Jazeera's editorial independence came into question when the channel's director of news, Salah Negm, stepped in at the last minute to order that a two-minute video covering a UN debate over the Syrian civil war include a speech by the leader of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Staff members protested that the speech was not the most important aspect of the debate, and that it was a repetition of previous calls for Arab intervention.

&gt;The Guardian also claimed in September 2012 that Qatar has taken steps in recent years to consolidate control of Al Jazeera English.

You can read the overview by the Lancet editor, Richard Horton, [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615601635). The last obesity series, in 2011, contained some really excellent papers by the worlds leading public health experts (central was [this paper](http://flygxe.ua.edu/labmeeting_papers/paper%202-8.pdf) (.pdf warning).  

Their key points, surrounding the (fairly obvious) argument that:
&gt;[In the first Lancet Series on obesity published in 2011] the globalisation of food systems that promote overconsumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages was identified as the major driver of the obesity pandemic.

are:

&gt;The obesity epidemic will not be reversed without government leadership


&gt;Business as usual would be costly in terms of population health, health-care expenses, and loss of productivity

&gt;Assumptions about speed and sustainability of weight loss are wrong

&gt;We need to accurately monitor and evaluate basic population weight data and intervention outcomes

&gt;A systems approach is needed with multiple sectors involved

[This paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361461744X) in the new series provides the intro and a good, broad discussion of why obesity needs to be tackled both top-down (from government policy) and bottom-up (grass-roots initiatives to engender support for policy change).

I think these papers are accessible by all, but I'm more than happy to upload the .pdfs if people want to read them.

The hypothesis produced by the American scientists that correlated saturated fats to heart disease was built on shaky foundations. After they stated that we all need to reduce our saturated fat intake and replace it with carbohydrates such as potatoes, rice, bread (edit: and sugars!) etc, obesity had gone through the roof, as has type 2 diabetes instances.

Fast forward to now, and scientists are finding that actually reducing your carbohydrate intake and replacing it with good quality saturated fats is actually better for you, and actually in line with how our bodies have evolved to work. People doing so are losing weight, finding they have more energy and less lethargy and are less likely to develop type 2 diabetes.

Sweeteners are  not the solution either, but of course the government won't  go near the sweetener or sugar industry as huge amounts of revenue are involved.
Some basic education is needed, for example if you fancy a piece of cake eat it with some protein, or at the end of a protein rich meal because that will slow down absorption of the sugars and increase satiety.

There's also several articles in the Financial Times criticising this, most notably
[**Martin Wolf**](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/11c048cc-0dcf-11e5-aa7b-00144feabdc0.html)

**Paul Krugman** has also criticised the proposal [in the NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/opinion/paul-krugman-seriously-bad-ideas.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0)

The **Office For Budget Responsibility (OBR)** have said; 
&gt;While the report from the OBR indicated that over the short term Mr Osborne’s budget surplus rule might stand up to scrutiny, over the longer term it did not.  This, the OBR said, represented an overall deterioration of 4% of GDP, equivalent to £76bn in today’s terms.

Four strikers is too many for a single-striker system, and it seems like it's going to be Sturridge, ST, Ings, Origi which is good depth depending on the quality of the other one.

Hendo and Milner are the absolutely perfect CM pairing for this formation, because they're both very energetic and capable of playing as the two in a wide diamond as well (which is important because positions are not static, and even when playing the narrow diamond they will end up pulled wide often).

Clyne seems a sensible fullback for this formation due to his offensive qualities. The only real question marks are Sterling (can easily play this formation, but then does that mean we don't sign another forward) and the DM spot. I think Emre could be ready for that spot (with Allen, Hendo and maybe Milner possible options to fill it), but it will be interesting to see.

The problem is that the lib dems (especially under Charles Kennedy) sold themselves as the party that played politics differently. Whilst the main two parties were more concerned about maintaining power, the lib dems put themselves across as the party that actually cared about the people and the constituents they represent. They opposed and presented issues that the main parties wouldn't. They were simply not the establishment. They could do no wrong.

However, when they got into power, things changed. When the lib dems were now in a position where they weren't in the side lines people realised the reality - the Lib Dems aren't an altruistic group standing up for the people, they have their own interests as well and ultimately they are about as fallible as the rest of them.

That is why we saw a surge in snp and ukip support. With people disenfranchised that the lib dems weren't the saviours of the people, they turned to the new guys claiming to be putting the people first.

Tl;dr tuition fees didn't kill the lib dems, going into government did.

If you consider it as a policy for creating a stable economy, yes it's utterly idiotic on every level and total nonsense. 

But if you look at it as a policy for acquiring power it makes good sense. The purpose of ""austerity"" is not to save us from a crisis - reduced public spending, targeting of the poor and huge increases in wealth and privilege for the rich have always been tory policy and probably always will. The purpose of austerity is to greatly increase the amount the government can take while restricting what they have to give back to smaller and smaller amounts. That's power: the ability to force others to do something against their will you don't have to do yourself. 

Now look at the policy again. What would the result of requiring by law something which is almost impossible? Near permanent austerity. More and more power. Less and less given back to us.

null,false,Keavinho10,lfc12,,null,"I'm also a big fan of this formation, but as you can see from the response people are always immediately concerned with where the likes of Sterling, Lallana, Marko, Ibe etc are going to play. Fact of the matter is every formation is going to leave people out regardless. It's better to look at this formation for it's values than who it leaves out, because trying to accommodate players is never a good policy.

Milner and Hendo are the absolute ideal midfielders to play in this sort of system, because they can both play central but also drift out wide when necessary. This gives adequate cover to the fullbacks and on top of that Can's role protects any lapses in that regard. Can isn't a natural DM, but he's definitely better there than Gerrard was from a defensive point of view. Hendo, Lucas and Allen can all slot in there when necessary too, and Can and Allen could also step forward in case of injury to Hendo or Milner. Lallana can play CM if needed, and even Coutinho if we're really going for the attack.

My favourite part of this setup is how it can morph into other formations if needed, and we definitely have the players for that. We may start the game with the 442 diamond, but then drift into a 433 and someone like Coutinho or Lallana (who started in AM) can go wide, and the likes of Sturridge can go the other side with our new marquee striker (fingers crossed) in the middle. Also we could start with Sterling in AM or ST, and he'd have no issue moving wide if needed. The diamond could switch to 442 box formation too, which would be easily done if Coutinho and Lallana are part of the diamond. Both can go more advanced and slightly wide with Hendo/Milner and Can behind.

People sort of forget and it was hard to notice with the dynamism of SAS, but we did use this system several times in 13/14. We didn't always start with it, but often times Coutinho would drop into mid beside Hendo, with Gerrard sitting and then Sterling would play laterally behind SAS.

So far so good. So I get there, and I'm with around another 50 other candidates. The process you get a group interview where you stand up and introduce yourself. Then you are split into groups and do a few group activities. You are then asked to a personal presentation.

At the end of it all they picked 2 people. I asked for feedback on why I wasn't sucessful, and the feedback I was given was, 'you were selected to attend to make numbers up to make it look good for our clients'.  So a whole day spent there, for basically no reason.

Alternatively, you may be able to fly, Manchester to Edinburgh and then to Inverness and train or hire car to Fort William (the road between Inverness and Fort William is one of the nicest drives I've ever done!).

Flights are often cheaper than the train. It's around 30-40 mins between Manc and Edinburgh (train from Lime St to Picadilly then tram (change at Cornbrook for the airport) takes you all the way there). I've never flown to Inverness, but have flown to Edinburgh from Manc quite a bit (used to be frequent, but not for a few years now) and it used to be on BMI Baby for around £30 each way. Trains can be £hundreds if you don't book in advance.

You can drive, for the love of all that's holy, save yourself, take the M62 to the M6 to the M74 and then the M9 (there may be a better route North of Glasgow, but I lived in Edinburgh and always used the M9 to go North, also, plan any driving trip so that you don't hit Glasgow at peak time), don't take the 62 up the East Coast, the traffic is almost always worse, and the A1 is in an almost perpetual state of roadworks, and is also one lane and windy between Newcastle and Edinburgh!

You *could*, if funds are a driving factor, catch a Megabus. There's one goes to London from Liverpool (near the Adelphi), but I don't know where you have to get to to go North, but I did Liverpool to London return for a fiver once. I won't lie, it was a proper bus, not a coach, it was cramped and I was sat next to a hugely fat woman who was knitting and elbowed me every ten-fifteen seconds the whole way, but, it was cheap and it got me where I needed to be. They definitely run to Edinburgh, but I don't know of they go *North*...

null,false,gin_and_jews,null,null,null,"Spot on.  As to your question on why American fans might not choose an MLS team, here's a comment I made when responding to a similar question on r/soccer:    

I do support my local team. To try to give you a better idea of what it's like, they're a local semi-pro team who plays in what would be the 2nd/3rd tier (though ""2nd/3rd tier"" is a bit misleading as it is very different to what European 2nd and 3rd leagues are).  The closest MLS team to me is a 5 hour drive.  Yes, a 5 hour drive is closer than an 8 hour flight to London, but neither are feasible on a regular basis.

The games are fun to go to, and they have events like beerfests before some of the games. But at the end of the day, they are just that; a semi-pro team. The league only has 12 teams, and every team is a minimum of hundreds and in some cases thousands of miles away so traveling to an away match is virtually impossible. We have finished top of the league before, but there is no promotion/relegation which puts a pretty large damper on things. I continue to go to games though as live football is always fun to watch.

I support Chelsea though as I have watched their matches on TV for many years now (my local team and league are not even televised). I have seen them play live in summer exhibition matches here several times and am planning a trip to London next August/September to see them at Stamford Bridge and couldn't be more excited. I've met English Chelsea fans at the pre game meetups when they've played here in the US and gotten drunk and sung songs with them. I have a real passion for the club and although I'm a foreign fan who will never have the same connection to the club as the local London fans, Chelsea is still a huge part of my life that I've thoroughly enjoyed.

His mantra is definitely overlapping into goldbug territory... Nobody I have spoken to in that field has ever given this any credence. If we look at the price charts, the relative price stability around the time of sales indicates that market conditions were not [wild](http://cl.ly/image/1d00141M2A3E) like those that usually accompany systemic risk scenarios.

From what I have seen, the supposed villains were either Goldman Sachs, or Rothschild, the eternal villains in most scenarios like this.

I think Browns biggest problem was his own ego as he seems to have believed that he had found a way to flatten the business cycle. Selling off gold per se isn't a problem, but the manner in which he did it tends to indicate a rather financial naivety... but then again, he thought he had defeated boom bust, so in his world view, Gold would never rise again, and so was unnecessary.  

His actions were consistent with his philosophy, but in hindsight pretty amateurish and a good indicator of how out of his depth he was as chancellor.

I'm a firm believer that Rodgers, when given the right players, is the best man for the job, but the club needs a director of football because our transfer market dealings have been horrendous. They can't understand that our team's largest need is a midfield destroyer. Lucas is well fitted for that role but his injury record will not magically go away, someone like Sevilla's Krychowiak would be ample cover. Other than that bringing in a new RB(Clyne) is needed and bringing a new striker should depend on whether we offload the misfiring trio of Borini, Lambert, and Balo. All three are good strikers, but they are just not good enough for a club like LFC with such high expectations. If we can fix these areas, I believe we can push on for 4th/3rd. Btw all this talk of Klopp is nonsense, there is no way that he would get us into the top 4, he was in the bottom spot in the Bundesliga half of the season with a squad that is on the same level as ours. Rodgers has learned from his mistakes, and last season's failures will show him what he must do to become LFC's next great manager.

Also, Anita is a liar and a hack. To begin: not only did she steal game footage for her videos without credit (for her ""professional"" critique show, that was given $150k for ""research""), but she also failed to deliver the content she originally promised her kickstarter backers. She claims to be a fan of gaming, and also [not](https://youtu.be/Afgtd8ZsXzI). She claims to be a feminist academic, but she cherry picks things to make her arguments and observations *look* correct, even though they are not. Two great examples are [Hitman absolution](https://youtu.be/WuRSaLZidWI) ""encouraging the player to revel in assault of females and their corpses"" (owtte) which is patently false, and also [this](https://youtu.be/kQbd5W7VKh4), but the videos are rife with this bullshit shoehorning of any and all games into a sexist picture frame.

Not only is she all that ^ stuff, but she is also the main face of feminism in gaming. And that is kind of a travesty, because she trivialises and gives feminism a bad name.

The phrases ""in the course of the

of being used or adapted for use in the Company or any Group Company"".

So, anything that you create at home, in your own time that might be useful to the employer, belongs to the employer.

That's not the worst clause of that type that I've seen. Some of them don't bother to qualify it, and just attempt to appropriate *all* so-called intellectual property that you create in your own time - even letters to grandma, unmade beds that might be construed as artworks, etc...

Personally I wouldn't sign this contract, as I think it's too broad. Slightly better ones restrict the works to those that are ""relevant to the Company's business"" - I'd *consider* signing something that said that, as long as the company's business was well defined (i.e. not someone like Google).

OP: I would offer to sign this contract with that clause stricken. Explain that the reason is that you write open source software in your own time. If they don't accept that, then suggest to them that your status as an open source programmer makes you a *more desirable hire*. If they still don't accept it, then I'd walk away and find an employer with more of a clue.

If the writers wanted [](#s ""the characters to lose their powers"") to drive the plot then they could have come up with another way for it to happen.

How do you equate bad decision making with the show being good?

I'm not just rambling off things I didn't like, I'm explaining why I think they're wrong. If a certain actor quit or a character died, you can argue that might upset fans, but that wouldn't make the show bad. Characters doing things that don't represent reality is more clearly a 'bad' thing. Again this is assuming the show isn't some surrealist art piece, which it isn't. You can have a character that's stereotypically dumb, and that can be a part of the show and drive the plot, but there are irrational decisions that even stereotypically dumb people wouldn't make, so seeing them do that is what I'm disagreeing with.

Brown sold gold to be consistent with his philosophy, which is fine, but hindsight tells us that his beliefs and understanding of markets were totally detached from reality. I don't buy the alternative theory on why he sold [gold either](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/39hmpi/gordon_brown_is_often_criticised_for_selling_off/cs4modm?context=3), and I do love a conspiracy. 

At the time of sale, Gold was at a multi year low, but the wider market context was overbought, trading at record highs... Prime for a correction. Typically, in times of distress, Gold is seen as a safe haven asset, often bought for portfolio protection. However, if as Brown did, you think you have defeated the business cycle, then yes Gold has no value. 

Osbourne finds himself in a different scenario. He has a stock in his portfolio which has had to strip itself of profitable units to pay down the bad assets. Like 1999-2002, we find ourselves in an overbought market but this time it is driven by a desperate hunt for yield due to a bond market bubble... Lots of voices are starting to call out a stock correction coming, and so Osbourne getting out of RBS now for a measured loss could be seen as simply getting out of a losing trade before the market tanks even further. 

What would be funny is if a correction caused systemic distress to RBS and the Gov had to intervene again, they would likely be buying back at a lower price (short selling), saving the treasury sveral billions on if they just held the position.

Whereas a lot of things people often say only extremist muslims believe in are actually criminal laws in several Islamic countries and believed in by the vast majority. And the differences between ISIS and the average Muslim from Afghanistan? ISIS wants to enforce a world-wide caliphate, which just means spread Islam across the world and be lead by somebody they think is a descendant of Muhammed, whereas the guy in Afghanistan doesn't care too much about spreading it across the world and just lets the government deal with all the killing, other than that their beliefs actually pretty much the same. It's a lot easier for the average muslim in those countries to change their world view a little bit and join ISIS than it is for the average American Christian to change their world view completely and join the KKK or the LRA.

If your current employer is offering a senior role, do you know what extra duties they would want you to complete? Will your potential new employer expect you to carry out a similar role to one your already in, or will it allow for new experiences?

Whats the reputation of your current and new employer in the sector?

So an anti-extremism politician is 'nonesence'? Really?

Here's two quotes of his I just found online:

&gt;The fact is that human beings are complicated animals. Unlike water, we don’t all boil at 100° Celsius. No catch-all cause of extremism can be identified. It is best to approach this subject with some general principles in mind that inevitably contribute to the phenomenon – grievances, identity crises, charismatic recruiters and ideological narratives

&gt;Quilliam (his think tank) does not support indiscriminate ‘mass spying’ on British Muslims nor a ‘police state’. Ordinary Muslims are our first line of defence against Islamist terrorism and our allies against extremists. We condemn any efforts to conduct mass spying operations on innocent Muslims through the Government’s Prevent programme.

Seriously I cannot believe you are comparing him to Choudary. I'm not even sure what type of point you think you're making. That's hardly even an extreme, he's pretty much bang in the middle from what i've seen, in fact a large part of what he wants to achieve is showing that you can be a political muslims that doesn't fly into buildings (paraphrased from his wikipedia page).

&gt;suggests the Irish tricolour is akin to UVF flags

There was TWO flegs on top of stormont. The tricolour and the ""irish republic flag"". 

&gt; Before reading the proclamation, Pearse and other Republican leaders seized the GPO and made it their military headquarters, flying the new flag of the republic (see image right) from the flag-pole instead of the British Union Flag. The green, white and orange tricolour was also flown on a lower flag-pole. The GPO, the Easter Proclamation and the tricolour (which later came to be seen as the flag of the republic, replacing the original green flag, which is now on display in the National Museum of Ireland) are the three most identifiable symbols of the Easter Rising

You may need a history lesson to learn their motives on this. The did it as a ode to the Easter rising when they seized the GPO and raised the two flags. Its not just a wee bit of banter by the builders. Look into them and you'll see what terrorist apologizing lunatics they're http://1916societies.com/ .


&gt;Unionists saw an Irish flag up for five minutes and reacted as if this was a crisis

Aside from the obvious crisis of someone UNAUTHORIZED ABLE TO GET ON THE FUCKING ROOF OF STORMONT its their motives that are sinister. Its like our version of ""american civil war re-enactors"" but these ones would do the real thing if they could. 

&gt;An Irish flag should not cause hysteria

&gt;""While only a symbolic gesture, nevertheless the actions concerned reflect the enduring reality that six Irish counties remain under foreign dominion, against the democratically-expressed wishes of the Irish people. Our intent was to further awareness of this matter at a time when the normalisation agenda of the British state, aided by local proxies of various political hue, continues unabated in its drive to legitimise the continuing occupation of Ireland."" - A paragraph of their statement


Yeah like thats not gonna piss of unionists... 

 The joke is that all this shite is coming from Lit-up. The person who loves to go on and on about fleggers. Only loyalist fleggers though..

I'm not going to get into the 'stealing' game footage, because it's such a daft argument. She used a few clips from some Let's Play videos. Those people don't own the rights to the footage. It's the equivalent of her grabbing a clip of Jurassic World from a YouTube review. She's discussing tropes and plot points, it's perfectly reasonable to nab a clip that illustrates the point she's making, instead of playing right the way through the entire game. And I've seen like, one example of that, yet people quite craftily mention it as if she steals all the footage.

Saying she 'failed' to deliver is also disingenuous, because it's an ongoing series that continues to be produced. So that's just outright lies.

She's not 'cherry-picking'. She discusses tropes, and she covers a fuckload of games in every video, spanning the entire history of gaming. She provides an absolute wealth of examples, and her entire project is based around exploring the use of tropes, which is exactly what she's doing. 

That Hitman Absolution clip is the *only* example people use, and here is where you're just proving me right in everything I'm saying. People have like, three points when it comes to Sarkeesian. They have the 'stealing' game footage (bollocks), they have cherrypicking (bollocks), and they have the Hitman Absolution clip (one mistake about a game). Oh, and also that video where she said she doesn't game that much, because apparently people can't have different interests at different points in her life.

Based on that, it would be reasonable to say 'okay, she has a few flaws'. It would not be reasonable to label her a liar and a hack, and then build her as a big supervillain. And this is my problem with GamerGate stuff in general, it's based upon exaggerating the few very minor flaws one can find and then using them to tell people that Anita Sarkeesian is a despicable feminazi fraud, and that type of thing.

Lot's of them have very good knowledge of the game, they're great about talking about classic matches and players, but ask them about the tactical adjustments during a game and the only one who will give you any decent answer is Michael Cox. 

Football journalism is mainly transfer rumours, club PR, stories from players/managers/coaches, and pure speculation about a players ability or future potential.

My point was that with RBS stripping its profitable units, it has been pretty much ignored by the equity rally in the past year or so.... so... with  with many expecting a correction in equities, alongside general roro correlations, this could imply that RBS could get pounded.

I'm not sure how else he could go about it. I don't really care that Brown pre-announced sales, or even that he could have gotten a better price... These numbers are not nation changing. Its just the arrogance/ignorance behind his philosophy that strikes me. 

With Osbourne, I think he is offloading an underperforming asset that probably is suffering for being Government owned. Sure, he is locking in a loss, but if we do see a correction and RBS was still on the books, it could be an even bigger loss for the Treasury.

My favourite is Rose Dust (matte dusky purple, doesn't budge, doesn't crack, stays beautiful and perfect all day, my favourite lipstick ever), and close seconds are Creme Caramel (nude MLBB, matte) and Forever Heather (pink MLBB, slightly frosty). Soft Taupe is good too, but it sinks into the lines of the lips a bit. Red Passion is a nice matte red, but it flakes around the corners of my mouth after a few hours, nothing that can't be solved by reapplication. 

Infinite Coral is a lovely colour, but it cracks, doesn't settle into the creases of your lips properly, and peels off like a sheet of plastic. I still use it though because the colour is so pretty. 

The one I wouldn't recommend is Hot Brown. It's a light nude, and it's incredibly streaky. It's literally impossible to make it look good. 

The only other Maybelline lipstick I've tried is Colour Sensational in Coffee Crazy. It smells kinda like coffee, is a lovely warm brown nude, glides on smoothly, and is very moisturising. But it doesn't stick around too well.

When would you ever see this about a man who kidnapped a child and ran away from the mother after being found incapable of looking after them properly by a Psychiatrist and Child Services.

When would a father who had kidnapped a child be allowed to sit in font of cameras and smile and laugh and joke it off as if it is nothing? 

This is bullshit, she's been judged to be non suitable for care for him, now people are acting as if she should be given full custody and how strong willed she is for doing it? She clearly doesn't give a shit about the child at all by the way she's acted. 

&gt;I'm hoping they will see all the support I have had and be sympathetic to me.

The whole situation has been handled pretty poorly, on all parts. Let me explain myself; 


1) he was justly rewarded in that same year (12/13) with a contract reported around 35k/wk


2) he had a lot of opportunities in the next season 13/14 and really blossomed with/learned from Suarez and in my opinion shold have been rewarded with abother bumper contract containing a release clause.


3) he wasn't and we lost Suarez, his mentor, and Raheem watched players of similar age (and arguably lesser/similar skill) be bought for loads of cash and immediately make more than him, some considerably more.


4) he didn't really have a super start to 14/15 and I doubt the club was excited about upping the wage bill by giving him (an arguably deserved) pay raise.


5) then the whole thing was blown out of proportion and brought directly into the media (initially by the manager/post match interviews etc.) And of course his I'll fated unauthorized interview.


6) he has one of the worst agents ever, and the issue was exasperated.


All in all its a sad situation that possibly could have been handled better all around, but it seems to be the way modern football is headed... all tabloids and headlines. 


I just truly hope an mutually benefitial solution can be worked out, be that staying and signing a new contract or leaving for a fee that is appropriate.

The money for the kickstarter was ostensibly for her to buy the consoles and the games necessary to do the research. In fact I'm pretty sure she explicitly said that in the video for it. Instead they just steal footage. Also, [video footage wasn't all they stole](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1smhvea).

&gt;Saying she 'failed' to deliver is also disingenuous, because it's an ongoing series that continues to be produced. So that's just outright lies.

Not really. Was it framed as an ongoing series when they first proposed it? The point is that the output quantity is pathetic. They could've put out more than twice that content already if they actually cared and it wasn't a scam.

&gt;She's not 'cherry-picking'. She discusses tropes, and she covers a fuckload of games in every video, spanning the entire history of gaming. She provides an absolute wealth of examples, and her entire project is based around exploring the use of tropes, which is exactly what she's doing.

And you've just lapped it up. Most of the content involves painting women as being discriminated against even though men have been discriminated against in exactly the same ways, and in some cases, more often. Her work has also contributed to [this](http://wiki.gamergate.me/index.php?title=Galbrush_Paradox) phenomenon.

&gt;Oh, and also that video where she said she doesn't game that much, because apparently people can't have different interests at different points in her life.

Of course they can. The problem is that she has also claimed that she has been a gamer ""for a long time"". https://youtu.be/yIpw3wHn9Sk

&gt;That Hitman Absolution clip is the only example people use, and here is where you're just proving me right in everything I'm saying

It's the only example people use because it's a fucking massive failure on her part. It's the most blatant example of her intellectual dishonesty, that can be passed around most easily. If you want more, you might try: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQJW3WMsx1q3BAZh3XsK1cSwCiaqjSulc

&gt; As in, the show is not meant to be a serious sci-fi where the universe is carefully planned out and everything adds up. 

Every show has some consistent universe that is planned out that adds up. Even the Looney Tunes had some consistent logic to it. Not fixing plot holes in that universe doesn't necessarily make it a bad show, but they're worth pointing out.

&gt; You are supposed to take the show at face value and say ""I love watching these characters interact with each other every week.""

Are you supposed to do that? I don't think you are.

&gt; You can't say Misfits is worse because the story didn't go how you wanted it to go.

You misunderstood my example about characters dying. I'm not saying Misfits is worse because the story didn't go how I wanted it to go, I already explained how that doesn't necessarily make the show worse. For example The Kite Runner had plenty of cases where the main character did something I disagreed with, but I don't think it made it a worse book. I'm saying that things happen in the show that are inconsistent with reality in ways that should be consistent.

I think the topic we are dealing with might be the suspension of disbelief, if it's not that then it's close to it. We can put up with certain things that would otherwise seem unreasonable, such as the superpowers, time travel, and even the fact that the main characters have to keep coming to do their community service. Within that narrative that we willingly separate from reality, we expect thing to be consistent to how they are in the real world.

&gt; That makes no sense. It DOES make sense when they sell their powers. They were tired of all the responsibility that came with having them.

Does it really? Could you see yourself or your friends or family making that decision in a similar situation? Or lying to your friend and saying that someone from the future told you that you should do it?

&gt; Do you think when they wrote a probation worker being killed 3 weeks in a row that they thought ""This is very realistic""?

Someone else already commented about this. The way I see it is that the killing of probation workers is like a running gag so we can to some extent put it aside, although I'm not a big fan of the lack of consequences. When they killed the third probation worker for the first time I think they did it well, they took away the consequences by going back in time, so they were able keep up the running joke. We already accepted time travel so it was internally consistent.

&gt; You're response is all over the place, so I don't even know how to respond. 

The first paragraph has examples of why I disagreed with ""It's why the show is good"". In the next part I asked you a question, because you said the bad decisions were why the show is good. In the larger paragraph at the end I explained how we can separate 'things that make the viewers upset' from 'things that take away from the show'. I think you accused me of calling the show bad from the first one again though so maybe it wasn't fully communicated.

Gaydon has the [Heritage Motor Centre](http://www.heritage-motor-centre.co.uk/) which is a good way to spend a couple of hours if you're into cars (has some original James Bond &amp; Judge Dredd cars from memories).

As others have said it's a quite picturesque area near to Warwick, Stratford (if you have any interest in the Bard - although it's, as expected, very touristy), Leamington Spa &amp; further afield Brum, Coventry &amp; Northampton for shopping etc.

If you're there on a Saturday [Wellesbourne Airfield](http://wellesbournemarket.co.uk/) has a large market which I've not been to in years but remember it being quite exciting as a child!

I think a largely overlooked issue here is that the indy ref was viewed by many as a re-establishment of Scottish identity by virtue of engaging with politics.  This has been exploited by the tories in the GE as 'keeping out a labour/SNP coalition' and they now purport to represent a country that rejected them.

[Our national debt as % of GDP actually dropped or remained stable throughout the 1970s](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/uk_national_debt_chart.html) during the oil crisis, the three day week, etc and even further during the 1990s crisis. Our government [ramped up issuing gilts](http://www.londonstockexchange.com/traders-and-brokers/security-types/retail-bonds/dmo-guide-to-gilts-2010.pdf) during the recession, increasing national debt - if debt was such a critical factor that would be the last thing they would do.

There is literally no question of the UK government defaulting on its debts - we are too much of a creditor for that to happen. That's why worrying about debt is just a front for slashing public spending - because you can explain it to the layman that the economy is like a credit card or a household budget (i.e. incomings must exceed outgoings), which it totally fucking isn't, and he'll agree that his public services need to be taken away.

UK government debt interest payments [are at somewhere around 3.5% of GDP](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/334/uk-economy/uk-national-debt/), because despite a very large national debt the gov't can borrow money at tiny interest rates, and counteract these with bond sales. While you or I might get 15% APR on a credit card the government's balanced interest (with its investment income and future earnings taken into account, and balanced against default risk) will probably be expressed in two or three decimal figures above 0%. 

To work it out properly, our GDP is £1,832,000,000,000 or thereabouts. Our public debt is around £1,457,000,000,000. So the government is paying around £64.12bn interest on that latter figure per year - which works out at an APR of around 4.4% on its public debt, which is almost all low-risk debt that will never default (and a lot of it is paid to UK-based investors in gilt and bond interest, aiding the economy). If you include the money the government makes from interest on its investments that drops even further. 

While too much debt can be problematic, it really is nowhere near as serious as the Tories make it out to be - but it helps them in their blind pursuit of ideology while placating the population so it's a win-win for them.",null,0,null,1434153310,null,0,1434155598,0,cs4sj8g,null,t3_39lxe3,null,t1_cs4sj8g,null,t1_cs4s5it,null,null,null,1436954308,null,31,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,31,null

And your other example is that they used artwork they thought was fair use, then took it down when the owner pointed out they couldn't? That despicable Anita Sarkeesian, bowing to that artist's request! What a shameless thief!

null,false,GJager,null,null,null,"1) Broadgate is just standard Uni accomodation. Its bad because its a long fucking way from the City Centre, but its good because its so close to uni so getting to lectures or society meets is piss easy. Most people take a gap year or two. Many are postgrad or there because they fell out with thier potential housemates and ended back in 1st Year accomodation like Broadgate. Try not to sound like an ""enlitened"" gap year wanker who really discovered himself in his travels.

2) Define Alternative... Go see Rock City on a Saturday I guess.

3) Plenty of Musical Societies depending on what you play, join and socialize accordingly. Lots of Open Mic nights or small events in Nottingham which you can gig at when you get something sorted.

4) Join in with the crowd and go mad on Freshers Week. Join a couple of societies and commit, you'll leave in 3rd year when you have to actually work anyway. Don't skip lectures, it quickly becomes a dangerous habit. Don't sign for a 2nd Year house until you are 100% your friends aren't really cunts. Wait till March at least, you'll get an average-shit house but you'll be less likely to have dumb house-drama which is better than living in a lovely warzone. Or your group of friends spilt after you sign, you lose your deposit and end up back in Broadgate, which is shit after you've tasted the sweet nectar of living in an actual house.

It doesn't matter who owned the game (footage). It's a matter of both courtesy, and academic rigour.

&gt;I'm happy to respond to criticism of Sarkeesian but coming from you

The thing is, I already made my mind up a while ago based on these videos from Thunderf00t and Sargon. I don't remember the intricate details, I only remember the big points that I've pointed out to you. If you favour her, these things will only appear to be circumstantial evidence; vague signs that might suggest corruption below the surface but not directly imply it. If you want to see what lies beneath you have to delve into videos like those by Thunderf00t that completely dismantle all of her arguments.

&gt;that one time she said that she wasn't a gamer

She didn't just say she wasn't a gamer at that point. She said ""video games"" like they were this foreign entity to her, that didn't interest her. She spoke about video games like a gamer doesn't.

&gt;I've been talking about Sarkeesian to people since the Kickstarter began, and your four points are the only things that people have ever shown me as criticism. My mind is fully open. Nobody has brought me anything that shows me anything more than a few things a human being's gotten wrong here and there while making a video webseries. That's literally the extent of it.

Maybe you just don't want to accept it?

&gt;I'm not watching fucking Thunderf00t

Not just Thunderf00t. *Fucking* Thunderf00t. What does that even mean? To me it suggests your mind is not open to what he has to say, regardless of its merit.

But okay, I am not the biggest fan of thunderf00t either. So here's some more evidence that she's full of shit:

I don't believe it's anything to do with academic rigour. To use another metaphor it's like forgetting a Shakespeare quote while writing an essay on the Bard, so you check another essay that you know has used that quote. It's still Shakespeare's writing.

People always seem to think my mind is closed because I have a problem with the criticism of Sarkeesian. But I've been shown the same stuff over and over, and every time, all it is is tiny shreds of things from here and there trying to prove some grand narrative about Sarkeesian that just doesn't follow. People going into exhaustive detail and coming up with small things you could find if you dug into anyone that prove nothing more than that Sarkeesian isn't perfect. Which I've never claimed her to be.

What none of it does prove, which I've been arguing all along, is that she's anything more than a perfectly inoffensive critic. The problem is that instead of simply disagreeing with her criticism, people try and undermine her outside of the criticism, paint her as a fraud (nope - she asked for money to make a project, is making the project with that money), a hack (nope - is simply discussing tropes in a way that nobody would bat an eyelid at in literary/film discussions), is an evil man-hating feminazi (nope. just nope).",null,0,null,1434157317,null,0,false,0,cs4ufet,null,t3_39kg4v,null,t1_cs4ufet,null,t1_cs4u0v4,null,null,null,1436955711,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

I should explain that there's a difference between what I meant as cringe comedy and just a comedian saying cringey things. Like I know a lot of stand up comedians, such as your favorite comics, will say outrageous things that make you cringe and laugh (and most times, like you said, they're honest yet still ""oh god"" kind of things). But cringe comedy is more, at the risk of explaining it terribly, more of a ""situational"" kind of comedy, if you know what I mean? It's not based exactly on what is said, but more the environment. For example the humor here isn't really me saying stupid things, but more just the situational comedy of having this celebrity in an interview, and then having it be a trainwreck of sorts. A good example of cringe comedy is the UK version of ""The Office"" (and the early seasons of the US Office). Of course I'm not saying this is anywhere near that level of brilliance, but that's just an example of cringe comedy. It's the situation - as Wikipedia best describes it (and of course we all know Wikipedia is always right): *""Cringe comedy is a specific genre of comedy that derives humor from social awkwardness""*. And it sounds terrible now because obviously deconstructing a gag saps any humor from it, but hopefully that sort of clears up what I meant?

All logistics of the comedy aside, either way, it didn't click for you, and any explanation of what I intended obviously won't matter. But I understand, to each their own! Thanks for explaining why you didn't enjoy it though, I appreciate you taking the time to watch and do so, as opposed to just downvoting or saying ""it was shit"" and leaving. If you have any additional feedback, that'd be great, although I guess since this type of humor isn't for you, there's not much more I could do to improve on it short of changing the style completely.

Right. But playing through a game is not the same as reading a book. There is interactivity, there is expression from the user. This is pretty much the whole premise of let's plays. But let's just steal some of that because fuck actually going back and recording that footage, this is just youtubez lel. Says the feminist ""academic"".

&gt;people try and undermine her outside of the criticism, paint her as a fraud

No. First of all... painting a picture of her as a fraud requires a lot of different elements. Most of the stuff I've been linking you all contribute to this painting. If you don't want to take it in, then of course you're not going to be convinced.

Secondly, people don't *just* seek to undermine her outside of the criticism. *The criticism itself is shit*. It's all based on fallacious ideas, like- for example- games themselves cause sexism, and that tropes in video games are *actually harmful*. We would all love to see some better written female characters in games, but that is not something feminism can make happen. At least not authentically. There is a good reason why video games are male-dominated, and it's not some conspiracy to put women down or exclude them from ""the boys club"". It's because they just aren't as interested in it as a gender.

To quote [this lady](https://youtu.be/HJihi5rB_Ek?t=37s) femfreq also approaches the topics with the intention of finding specific material that supports her pre-existing conclusions, rather than doing it the other way around, the logical and honest way. Granted, that doesn't necessarily make the conclusions false, but if this- accompanied by the fact that she disables comments, and refuses to debate anyone publicly- aren't raising some red flags with regards to the intellectual honesty side of things, then I don't know what will.

Plus, you can't make the claim that people seek to beat her by ad hominem and then refuse to watch thundef00t's videos, where he focuses on her ***arguments specifically*** and not her person. What you are basically asking is that I retread ground and write out a full breakdown of every one of Anita's arguments, and I'm sorry but I can't be fucking bothered, mate. It's all there in thunderf00t's videos, if you can't be arsed to to watch that (and I wouldn't blame you) don't go around wondering why people hate feminist frequency, because it's that stuff. Also, you were the one who said people paint FemFreq as EVIL, and then you proceed to tell me that people go beyond her criticisms? Well the reason people think she's EVIL is because she is a dishonest hack who jumped upon the trendiness of gaming &amp; feminism in 2012 to make a quick buck.

He wasn't terrible. At least, he wasn't any worse than Van Persie and not that much worse than Rooney was on a lot of occasions. I would suggest many of the issues with forwards at United go beyond individual ability and stem from a lack of creativity in midfield which Chelsea offers a lot of. Di Maria also went from one of the best players in the world to sub par going to United. Who's to say Falcao isn't havng similar problems? You're exclusively blaming an injury when there are a whole raft of reasons which will have contributed. Not every player is capable of starting at their absolute peak at a new club. All of this is further compounded by the fact that he was only considered terrible because he was expensive and overhyped. Given he'd be cheaper at Chelsea and replacing Drogba who didn't exactly set the world alight, as well as coming off a worse season and so not expected to be incredible every time he played, it would be nowhere near as bad as you're making it out to be.

You're also completely failing to see why Mourinho would want Falcao. He doesn't want him to replace Remy, he wants him to replace Drogba. There is a very big difference. When Drogba started it was playing as a target man and player to hold the ball up to compensate for a lack of pace which Falcao is more than capable of doing. So maybe think a little more before insulting someone about how they represent all that's 'wrong with football'.

Okay, if you say so, BritishHobo. Glad to have an authority here on the matter, who buys into all her shitty stuff and refuses to listen to any criticisms of her, writing them off as ad hominem (as though character attacks aren't relevant when discussing someone's *character*).

&gt;She's not a scam artist

Good to know.

&gt;she's producing exactly what she said she would

And I'm sure we'll have it all, by 2030.

&gt;(she discusses tropes and plot - nothing interactive anyone could do in a game would mean that the couple of bits of footage she used were unrepeatably personalised

Again, it's about respect. Both to those she takes from, and to earn it from those who would judge her. Also, video footage isn't the only thing they've stolen.

&gt;[In March of 2014, Feminist Frequency was accused of misappropriating artwork from an artist for Tropes vs Women from an artist named CowKitty.](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1smhvea)

I linked this story earlier but I'm assuming you didn't look because you haven't commented on it. (They abused their ""status"" as a non-profit to get around it, but that didn't work, so they are currently racking up a large fine for breaking the law).

-

&gt;she is simply one person discussing tropes and giving her view on those tropes. That's it.

I really wish she was. But because of the perfect storm of the trendiness of feminism + gaming, she has the potential to be a huge influence and power in the scene.

[""The ambassador award honors an individual who has helped the game industry advance to a better place.""](https://youtu.be/yIpw3wHn9Sk?t=1m56s) I mean wow. ""A better place"". All she has done is help create a narrative that gamers are bigoted, hateful, misogynistic idiots who don't care for change or progress. That any woman who comes into the industry with honest intentions will be harassed and threatened. If anything, that has set things *back*. This is not a healthier industry. It is a more hateful one.

&gt;All the stuff outside of that, the tiny snatches of video here and there, that people pull together to create this mad conspiracy, that's bollocks. Hate her criticism if you want - think she's fundamentally wrong on every point. That's absolutely fine. But then engage on that level. **That's what the extent of the debate should be.**

No it shouldn't. Someone coming into the industry and simply being wrong wouldn't have made much of a ruckus. Anita is a celebrity, an icon. Not only that, but it's not just her work that is riddled with dishonesty. Her whole role in the industry is surrounded by unscrupulous activities and dishonesty.

&gt;[""Anita Sarkeesian has played video games her whole life.""](https://archive.is/46iAL) 

First line. Patently false. 

&gt; after observing that women represent about 40% of the gaming audience, she launched a crowdfunding campaign for Tropes vs. Women in Video Games

Anita doesn't deal with the games that this ""40% of the gaming audience"" play. That 40% of the gaming audience includes shit like farmville, candy crush. Not ""gaming"". 

&gt;But she also became the target of vicious, misogynist harassment that included death and rape threats, pornographic vandalism of her Wikipedia page and a coordinated effort to have her Kickstarter flagged as terrorism. All of this because she wanted to have a conversation about the way women are portrayed in video games.

 * we NEED goals and experience. 

 * if we can move on sterling for 45-50m, add the 20m we wanted to throw at Benteke, and pay over the odds for a goal scorer, we would probably be better off in the short term than helping Sterling to develop, because we have more depth in his position than any other. I'm talking about getting a real 20+ goal striker in. If we had that this year, we would have made top 4 easy imo. We need CL football more than 2-3 times/decade to be attractive. 

 * it seems likely that Sterling will develop into a world class talent, and so letting him go could be a big mistake...

 * BUT does it matter if we have one world class winger if we're still just in and out of the Europa league?

[Some info on the SS Lake Erie as a ship in the 'Beaver Line' routes taking people to Canada.](http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/CP2.html#anchor19433)

[This site](http://www.norwayheritage.com/p_ship.asp?sh=laeir) (some pictures of the ship here) also confirms that the ship was bought by the Canadian Pacific Line in 1903, ~~but I've not been able to find any specific routes for the year 1909.~~ (Although... [this](http://boards.ancestry.com/localities.northam.canada.ontario.lanark/18.25.1.2.1/mb.ashx) message on some random forum - maybe written by you (?) in 2005, does specify the date as 15th April 1909 from Belfast Lough. 

However, [this site](https://familysearch.org/photos/stories/11851317) states (thinly) that the SS Lake Erie was running Liverpool to Montreal/Quebec during these times, but I've no idea how varied the trips and routes were and ~~can't find anything relating SS Lake Erie to Belfast.~~ Aha! [Here](http://www.dippam.ac.uk/ied/records/23770) is a newspaper advertisement showing the SS Lake Erie going from Belfast to New Brunswick in 1909. 

The only James Graham who comes up in the archives for Pacific Railways in Canada at that time that doesn't have an incorrect surname (no surname displayed) worked as a coach painter. [Here is a document.](http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/railway-employees-provident-fund/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=18114&amp;) It may not be the same person. Transcona is a long way from New Brunswick, unless there's another place with that name that's not coming up on google maps. They have their own archives on railways it seems, but are charging for access.

Anyway, I've lived beside Belfast Lough forever and it looks like [this](http://www.gallery.photoglow.co.uk/img/s11/v37/p298274729-3.jpg). On a good day... :)

That advertisement references the Railways too, with an application address in Victoria Street. This is Victoria Street in [1912](https://www.nmni.com/titanic/Design-Build/Why/Victoria-Street.aspx). Here it is [today](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@54.600261,-5.924439,3a,75y,358.31h,90.61t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sstYfb7wb7Sl-DIGiG7GyKw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).  So, for any of us living anywhere near Belfast, we've all walked (or driven) in the same street as your great great grandfather walked down the day he applied for the Railways job. Cool.
