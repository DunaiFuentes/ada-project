His attempts to be as offensive as possible destroys the humorous side of it all, because you know what to expect and humour only works when you get surprised. Personally the only person I've seen who can do offensive comedy well is Jimmy Carr. 

Also, Boyle supports the SNP, which just makes this a weird article. He wants to actively leave both the Eu and the UK and completely shut Scotland away from the world, which in terms of immigration, it's worse that what the UK wants, which is just to control its borders more. The comments on the article are even worse. I think this says more about the Scottish education system, anyway who is paying for that...ohhh.

You'll be getting free shots. If you are not used to drinking you are going to be wasted. Pub crawls like this are designed to be 'messy'. A night of civilised conversation and tasting the local brews it won't be.

A lot of the best points have been covered already..here are mine.

1. Line your stomach. Eat a decent meal before. Burger and chips etc

2. Stick to one type of drink. Stick to beer or stick to shots. Don't mix unless you want to get really drunk and feel appalling the next day.

3. Declutter your wallet of non essentials in case you lose it. Do you need all your cards etc.

4. Rounds. Work out how many people are in the 'round'. Then understand that the amount you will drink goes in multiples of that number. It is socially acceptable not to engage in rounds provided you do it at the start or you leave when everyone has bought the same number of drinks and before the round starts again.

4. Do you know how you are getting home safely? My experience of being stuck in London after the tubes and trains stopped running was not good. Don't assume it's a 24 hour city.

5. Be streetwise. Be aware of over friendly strangers (we are Brits after all so it should seem odd).

Most interesting to me are Davies and Soldado.  I think both have suffered for not performing on an eye-catching individual level (Davies doesn't have the forward thrust of Rose, and Bobby has obviously been well and truly eclipsed by Kane's goal avalanche), but there is a case to be made for their function within the team.

What I'd love to see (not that I'm asking you to do this!) is a function of points earned in correlation to the time on the pitch when the points were earned.  For example, if Soldado starts but gets hauled off at half time with us 1-0 down, and then Kane comes on and scores two late goals to win it, then you can't exactly argue that Soldado's starting actually affected the points earned.

@OP I've got my car on a PCP deal at £245/month for 3 years with £500 deposit. It's not that cheap monthly, but the running costs are next to nothing, you can get far cheaper, I just like luxuries. I go through £30 of fuel every month, road tax is free and because it's a 1.0l engine (Ford EcoBoost) the insurance is costing me £300/year (me at 26 + gf who's 25 and been driving for 3 months at time of taking insurance out), my previous car was a 1.6l and cost £600 to insure. The 1.0l EcoBoost is more powerful, go figure!


I've had used cars, my first one was great, owned it for 6 years trouble free, but hit 10 years old and needed £1000 worth of repairs which I couldn't afford in one lump at the time, the car was worth £1500, so I got rid.


My 2nd used car cost me £149/month to finance, 3 year old car. After 18 months the rear suspension seized up costing me £700 and I was told to get it through its MOT it would need a new exhaust (a trusted 2nd opinion agreed on both). I'd just got a promotion with a healthy pay rise at work, so I went to the showroom and bought a brand new car instead which after 1 year I've had no issues with, extra creature comforts and I love the styling of it! 


My plan is after 3 years to pay the minimum value (calculated at time of purchase, and is a very conservative estimate) and buy the car outright. That way I know its history and it's been well looked after and when it does go expensively wrong I'd happily do a PCP deal all over again.

Ivanovic has been amazing for Chelsea, I'll never forget his real coming out party at Anfield, but I also don't want to watch Chelsea fail to freshen things up leading to years of poor league performance. I think that's what happened with our last team, with the title win in 09/10 being a bit of a last hurrah. It's what's happened to United post Fergie, and it looks like it's happening at City now. 


I think Ivanovic *could* easily have another couple of seasons of good performance, but with the fullback position being so important in terms of athleticism it wouldn't be the worst idea to move him on if the club has suitable plans to replace him. I've not seen the stats on it, but my impression this season is a vast majority of our goals that we concede have come down our right hand side, and I think as much as Cahill hasn't been fantastic, it's poor covering from Ivanovic leaving him exposed at times. There's definitely some tactical element to how high up the pitch Ivanovic plays, but at a point you have to wonder is the trade off offensively worth how exposed it leaves our defence when he can't get back quick enough? Would another player be more suited? 


I'll certainly miss Ivanovic if he leaves, and I also wouldn't be upset at all if he stayed, but I can see some justification for moving him on, especially with Cahill set to hit 30 in December. 3/4 of the defence being 30 or older has a pretty big impact on our ability to push up the pitch, and is a concern going forward for freshening things up.

Surly you mean the media construct of Edward Grylls, the man commonly referred to as ""[Souffle Boy](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-470460/Bear-faced-cheek-adventurer-sneaked-hotels.html)"" in the industry? Youngest person to climb Everest at the time? - no, that's a porky.  First person to paraglide over Everest a few years late? no - another porky. Ex SAS? Kinda, maybe - does a couple of years in their TA count?

The thing is, he does do all that shit on TV, but its really, really hammed up (Lets face it, if someone paid me his fees, I would happily drink my own piss on a regular basis) and speaking as someone with 20 years in the industry, its just not that hard or difficult.  

Born Survivor?  Well I only know about the Sahara edition as a few of the guys who worked for me did 6 weeks with him in Morocco sorting out safety and logistics for the filming.  Firstly, Morocco isn't really the Sahara, its more akin to a cross between the South Downs and Southern Spain in terms of isolation and ""desertyness"".   Then there were the locations...  No further than an hours drive from a 4 star hotel with a pool and somewhere to land a helicopter?  Not really that hard to survive really.

My biggest grip though was a few years ago I was running a charity event to twin UK schools with schools in Mali, which as a big component was serious crossing of the Sahara.  Much media was involved and as part of the fundraising we tried to get some personalities involved.  Souffle Boy wanted £10k, a driver from London, accommodation and food to give out prizes at a raffle - Mears said he would do it for free and bung in some prizes. (Unfortunately the event got canceled due to the war in Libya and subsequent war in Mali, so we never did it anyway)

Anyway, I'm not going to rant any more because I don't want anyone to be shown to breach contract and lets face it - Its just TV entertainment, and with all entertainment, the lines get blurred between reality and fiction.  Souffle Boy has made a good wedge out of all this, so really, who am I to judge how he earns his crust. (He's just a bit of a knob that's all!)

Leaving: Stevie, Glen, Manquillo (maybe), Flanno (maybe)

Bring in:

- Ings (Free + Sign-on fee)

- Ayew (Free + Sign-on fee)

- Matias Kranevitter from River Plate cause he's practically Mascherano 2.0 (12m or so?). Maybe Camacho from Malaga.

- Janmaat (12-15m? Unsure)

- Samir Handanović (20m or so), Inter is doing poorly, and his prime years are going to waste. Alternative would be Begovic, cause we're a step up from Stoke and he is pure quality.

If Sterling goes, then we save that cash for January and/or look at upgrading from Ings to somebody like Vietto or Pedro (if we're feeling lucky).

Total is  ~52m (with sign on bonuses) +/- Sterling money with a bit left over from sales. The rest will be spent on  a party for me for saving LFC because I'm the hero that LFC deserves, but not the one it needs right now.

Striker: Aubameyang - With Klopp leaving and Dortmund definitely not heading for a champions league place, we could definitely have a chance of luring him away. I think we could get him from 20-27 mil.

Midfield: Xhaka - Now this is just my personal preference, but I feel he could add an incredible amount of quality to our midfield. He's only 22, has a great passing range, is good at tracking back and making a tackle and can score the odd worldy.  He's unfortunately just signed a new contract and his team look destined for a champions league place. I feel we could land him from between 17-25 mil though.

CDM: Baumgartlinger - This guy is an absolute work-horse and I really rate him in general. I think we could get him for 10 mil and he would be great with Lucas being injury prone and rumoured to be leaving.

RB (But capable of playing CDM too): Bryan Dabo - He's 22 and has looked great all season. I've chosen him as with my other targets I believe we'd have spent the majority of our money, and we'd definitely get value for money from Dabo. 

Out: Balotelli, Aspas, Borini, Alberto and Enrique. Profit (hopeful approximation): 22-27 million.

Leaving: Gerrard and Johnson. Profit: Lots of spare wages.

They mean 'a man on a bike'. It's daft that they always lump anyone who rides a bike together like they're an homogeneous group. They don't do the same thing for drivers. They always qualify it in some way. To be fair, the cycling advocacy groups are guilty of the same thing. I remember reading about a 17 year old cyclist who had been killed. Turned out he was killed while cycling around a housing estate at 1 o'clock in the morning. Am I a monster for assuming that he was probably cycling with the same inconsiderate attitude as every other 17 year old scrote in a tracksuit cycling in the dark?

First link I came up with for genuine statistics.

Everything about gay pride is geared towards celebration of gay, lesbian and transgender culture.  We bisexuals have a coffee morning.  We can't be bisexual in a gay club because if we are, we get accused of ""passing"" at best (by gay people) or of ""abusing a safe space"" (by feminists).

Bisexual women are told they are flaunting it or are ""doing it for their boyfriends"".  Bisexual men are told endlessly to ""come out of the closet and just admit it"".  Even from people that know better.

Yes, our experience is comparable to trans people because we don't have a community of support.  We don't get it.  We get abuse from that community.  Say what you will about LGT but apart from the TERF lesbian contingent, they at least support transgender people.

You dont have one. Are you actually this slow? Rafa won trophies. He will be remembered for those great times. He will also be talked about because of some massive massive goof ups (Alonso), falling from grace in his last season etc. 

The thing with your man is that he's achieved a sum total of fuck all. Why would anyone recall him? What has he done yet to garner any respect? He's the manager of LFC? That's not reason enough. Hodgson was as-well. 

So, I completely understand that it hurts. But it's totally fine. You can carry on the narrative for him. I'll call it out as it is.

Something I'm conscious of though is how many of our English players we've lost and how many we may or may not get in.

Secondly, we were always worried about floating voters not thinking Ed looked the part and suddenly all going Tory on polling day (like in 1992) but as his approval ratings improve, there'll be more of them going our way.

There's also the relative softness of the Lib Dem and Green vote: Lib Dems and Greens are more likely than others to change their minds before polling day, and I suspect they're more likely to move to Labour than any other party (a few might be switching between the Greens and the Lib Dems, but this doesn't help the Tories much). This is in contrast with Ukip voters, who Cameron's trying to woo, and who are pretty well-decided and anyway make up a smaller proportion of the population than Lib Dems and Greens combined.

Finally, Ed and Labour are both creeping up in areas like 'ready to govern', and even coming out on top in areas like Immigration Policy, which we never thought would happen, while maintaining our leads on the NHS, education, living standards, etc. Our manifesto policies were overall more popular than the Tories, too, according to YouGov (albeit the Tories had the single most popular policy).

Even though most of this hasn't translated into consistent poll leads yet, I think what's happening is that that the undecideds are increasingly leaning towards Labour, which is why we're seeing our leader and our policies getting more popular as people turn their attention to the election.

You also completely misunderstand the function of Reddit, which is to create *sub*reddits as subcommittees based around given topic. In fact if you read site FAQ it will spell that out for you and how those subcommunites require moderation to keep them on topic. 

&gt;The reason there are separate subreddits is to allow niche communities to form, instead of having one monolithic overall community. These communities distinguish themselves with a unique focus, look and policies: what's on- and off-topic there, whether people are expected to behave civilly or can feel free to be brutal, etc.
One issue that arises is that casual, new, or transient visitors to a particular community don't always know the rules that tie it together.

&gt;As an example, imagine a /r/swimming and a /r/scuba . People can read about one topic or the other (or subscribe to both). But since scuba divers like to swim, a casual user might start submitting swimming links on /r/scuba . And these stories will probably get upvoted, especially by people who see the links on the reddit front page and don't look closely at where they're posted. If left alone, /r/scuba will just become another /r/swimming and there won't be a place to go to find an uncluttered listing of scuba news.
The fix is for the /r/scuba moderators to remove the offtopic links, and ideally to teach the submitters about the more appropriate /r/swimming subreddit.

Oh the fucking horror! 

Worse you are putting minatory groups and communities into a catch 22. In TwoX case if they banned guys from the sub you'd have the same shitstorm here but allowing everyone in and get upset with arseholes trying to drive it off the topic it was created to discuss is ""acting frumpy"". So if they wish to actually bother having a subreddit at all you'll find a way to bitch at them about it. Well done you.

He is vital to the way we play. If Drogba is not playing he is the one Courtois aims his goal kicks at. Not Costa or one of our smaller attackers because Ivanovic always wins those aerial battles.

null,false,Homospatial,null,null,null,"Summary:

 The financial crisis and associated recession resulted in a sizeable, and
mostly permanent, increase in borrowing. While the coalition government
has overseen a reduction in borrowing from a peak of 10.2% of national
income in 2009–10 to 5.0% in 2014–15, whoever forms the next
government still faces the task of finishing the job of reducing borrowing
back to sustainable levels.

 This election briefing note considers the fiscal plans of the Conservatives,
Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party (SNP). All four
parties have said they would reduce borrowing in the coming parliament.
None has managed to be completely specific about how much they want to
reduce borrowing, or exactly how they would do it. In analysing their
policies we have had to make some assumptions about their precise aims
based on their stated aspirations and policies.

 All four parties’ plans imply further austerity over the next parliament. The
Conservatives are planning a reduction in borrowing over the next
parliament of 5.2% of national income, which would result in a surplus of
0.2% of national income by 2018–19. Labour have been less clear about
their plans for borrowing, but their ambition to balance the current budget
would be consistent with a smaller reduction in borrowing of 3.6% of
national income, bringing it to 1.4% of national income by 2018–19. The
Liberal Democrats are aiming for a borrowing reduction of 3.9%, to be
achieved a year earlier (i.e. in 2017–18), while the SNP tax and spending
plans imply a borrowing reduction of 3.6% of national income, but this
would not be completed until 2019–20.

 The differences between the Conservatives on the one hand, and Labour and
the SNP on the other, are substantial. The Conservatives need to find much
more substantial spending cuts; Labour and the SNP would reduce the
deficit and debt significantly more slowly.

 Under the Conservative plans, debt as a share of national income could be
reduced from 80% of national income in 2014–15 to 72% by 2019–20.
Under Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP plans, debt in 2019–20 could be
more like 77%, 75% and 78% respectively. Under the assumptions we have
made, debt would be about £90 billion more in 2019–20 if Labour’s plans
were implemented than if the Conservatives’ plans were implemented.
Higher debt entails higher debt interest payments, and would potentially
leave the government less well placed to deal with future adverse events.

Since the Conservatives’ plans imply the greatest reduction in borrowing,
the Conservatives have the greatest job to do in terms of setting out how
they would achieve this. Despite this, their detailed tax policies are a net
giveaway of 0.1% of national income, their detailed social security measures
would only provide a tenth of the cuts that they have said they want to
deliver, and their commitments on aid, the NHS and schools would (relative
to a real freeze) increase spending on these areas by 0.3% of national
income.

 The Conservatives have squared this circle with an aspiration to raise 0.2%
of national income (around £5 billion) from clamping down on tax
avoidance, unspecified further cuts to benefits amounting to 0.5% of
national income (about £10 billion), and a further real terms cut to
‘unprotected’ departmental spending of £30 billion that was not mentioned
in their manifesto. So the Conservatives need to spell out substantially more
detail of how they will deliver the overall fiscal targets they have set
themselves.

 Under the Conservatives’ plans, and assuming they find the social security
cuts and revenues from tax avoidance that they have targeted, total
departmental spending would need to be cut by 7.1% between 2014–15 and
2018–19. This would be a slightly slower rate of cuts than over the previous
parliament (an average cut of 1.8% per year compared to 2.4% per year
between 2010–11 and 2014–15). Departmental spending would fall to its
lowest level in real terms since 2003–04. Outside of aid, the NHS and
education (which have been promised various levels of protection by the
Conservatives), other departmental spending looks to be facing cuts of
17.9% between 2014–15 and 2018–19. This would be on top of the 18.1%
cut experienced between 2010–11 and 2014–15, leading to a cumulative cut
over the whole period from 2010-11 to 2018-19 of 32.8%). These
‘unprotected’ areas include defence, transport, law and order and social
care.

 Labour have been much less clear about exactly what level of deficit
reduction they want to achieve and by when but they have given more detail
of how they would achieve any deficit reduction. Their detailed measures
would boost rather than reduce tax revenues. The cost of their protections
for public services is about the same as the Conservatives’ – though they
have not spelled out a commitment to increase NHS spending by as much as
the Conservatives have. In practice, it might not be surprising were they to
deliver increases to NHS spending of at least that scale. They have, however,
been clear in their manifesto that some cuts to ‘unprotected’ departments
would be required.

It looks like Labour might need only relatively small cuts to departments
other than aid, NHS and education spending – on top of the cuts already in
place for 2015–16 – to bring about a balance on the current budget by
2018–19. But we can only say “looks like” as Labour’s pledge to ‘get a
surplus on the current budget’ is vague. Given the coalition government’s
investment plans it would be consistent with any reduction in borrowing
totalling 3.6% of national income or more. If a Labour government were to
increase investment spending their pledge would also be consistent with a
smaller reduction in borrowing than that. Of course, if Labour are actually
aiming for a lower level of borrowing than we assume, then they would have
more detail to spell out in terms of how they plan to get there.

 The Liberal Democrats are aiming for a tightening between that of Labour
and the Conservatives. They have failed to spell out details of how they
would achieve much of their tightening, relying heavily on unspecified
measures to reduce tax avoidance and evasion (£7 billion) as well as some
unspecified social security cuts (£2 billion). They are also relying on cuts to
departmental spending (£12 billion), although (unlike the Conservatives)
these were mentioned in their manifesto. Their plans require real cuts to
departmental spending of 3.4% between 2014–15 and 2017–18 (or 9.0%
outside of the NHS, education and aid). This is predicated on their aspiration
to raise 0.3% of national income (£7 billion) from highly uncertain measures
to reduce tax avoidance and evasion by 2017–18. By the end of the
parliament the Liberal Democrats claim to expect to raise £10 billion – twice
as much as the Conservatives, and a third more than Labour, from such
measures.

 The SNP’s fiscal numbers imply the same reduction in borrowing over the
next parliament as Labour, although the reduction in borrowing under their
plans would be slower. They would cut less to start with but the implication
of the plans they have spelt out in their manifesto is that the period of
austerity would be longer than under the other three parties we consider.
Their tax takeaways appear to be offset by their tax giveaways, while they
would increase the generosity of the social security system. As a result,
while they would increase total spending in real terms each year,
departmental spending would be broadly frozen between 2014–15 and
2019–20, and departmental spending outside of the NHS and aid could be
facing a cut of 4.3%. Their stated plans do not necessarily match their antiausterity
rhetoric.

picture of what they can expect from any of these four parties.",null,0,null,1429783827,null,0,1429784021,0,cqlulsl,null,t3_33kv7v,null,t1_cqlulsl,null,t3_33kv7v,null,null,null,1432554756,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, all future General Elections shall take place on the first Thursday in May every five years, barring special circumstances.

In my head we go into next a season playing 1 striker. We've seen the problem Man City have keeping 4 strikers happy even though Jovetic and Aguero's injuries allow for rotation, and they sometimes play 2 up top. That's why I believe Sturridge (who along with Sakho and Lallana should have an easier time with muscle injuries, thanks to a summer off instead of a World Cup) Balotelli and Origi should be sufficient, especially as Sterling can comfortably lead the line of we do get desperate. 

Speaking of Sterling, ideally we keep him but if he does move on then we go for...

Pedro £18-20m

Danny Ings £? (Compensation)

What we've had pretty frequently now is a match thread being stickied past the point of relevance, e.g. Swansea for ten days, Krasnodar for two weeks, or a random thread being stickied for no apparent reason (http://www.reddit.com/r/Everton/comments/2xyvp1/can_we_compare_the_season_we_are_having_to/).  No disrespect to the mods but this looks amateurish and makes us appear like an inactive community, when in fact we've grown in numbers and are pretty lively lately.

For that reason I would be wary of making a big commitment such as daily sticky threads. The upvote system works and allows for a natural ebb and flow to discussion, and drops thread in which people have no interest. I remember the transfer window threads which were stickied for weeks (months?) and discussion naturally stopped after a while and it was just a dead thread sitting at the top of the page for a long time. Too much structure cam be a bad thing.

I would seriously considering drafting in another mod or two given the sub's growth, activity, and the fact that several of the mods are inactive or have obligations to multiple other subs. There are a number of active and well-respected Everton redditors kicking around, e.g. /u/practically_floored and /u/spacecat17 has been doing a good job of posting the match threads. Obviously whether they have any interest in being a mod is another story.

* A mother with a pram and two small children slowly pushing the pram out onto the road at a crossing where cars had the green light, until the cars saw what she was doing, slowed down, where she then pushed out more and walked across.
* Other car drivers pulling out onto roundabouts forcing a hard brake (okay it's a bastard of a roundabout that I'm thinking of in particular, but still)
* An oncoming motorcyclist who was overtaking traffic on a bend. Again forced a hard brake, to avoid slamming into him.
* Driver who was about to get into his car opening the door wide into the road as cars approach both ways.
* Two cyclists riding together, but changing their formation to side-by-side to single file. Admittedly I don't think cyclists should feel pressured to ride in gutters, but their wavering and changing made me wary to overtake until the road opened up.
* People generally taking speed limits as speed targets. Or just ignoring them completely.

Greater Anglia run the ""metro"" and the ""mainline"" trains on the line. The metro services run between London and Shenfield, some stopping nearly everywhere in between, others just at a few bigger stations like Romford, Ilford and Stratford. The mainline runs into London from places further out like Colchester, Ipswich, Southend, etc. Some of these stop at Shenfield on the way in, but not Brentwood, I guess because Shenfield is a junction, and because of Crossrail.

If you're buying in Romford, it's always worth timing your journey to get a fast train rather than the slow ones. If you're buying in Brentwood/Shenfield, I'd recommend trying to commute from Shenfield - either get a fast metro one or jump on something coming in from further out.

A lot of people who would benefit from a placebo would benefit far more from somebody sitting down with them and talking to them about the problem.

I've posted this to /r/ukpolitics, but reposting it here in the hopes it gets a little more exposure:

Full disclosure: this is something I've worked on personally and I'd very much like it if Reddit would take part in it and share it with anyone who may find it useful as an educational tool.
We decided to launch a website that takes a light-hearted look at the previous UK elections. Our hope is that the website will educate people, especially those who are only just able to vote, on the history and importance of politics in the UK.

Our office is comprised of mainly younger people, being in the web development business, and most of us are only voting for the first or second time ourselves. I've personally learnt a lot while helping to create this infographic, for example I was never even aware that Maggie Thatcher and Tony Blair ran for multiple terms, or that the Liberal Democrats used to be two separate parties until their alliance.

The site also features a live opinion poll, you can enter your postcode and a list of candidates is presented to you, allowing you to vote. We're hoping that with enough people entering data into our site that we can get a good idea of how the election might turn out.

To address any privacy concerns: we use a simple Facebook login system to ensure as many of the votes as possible are legitimate and not spam, and to avoid people voting multiple times. We don't store any user data apart from your Facebook ID. We decided against using Twitter logins in addition to Facebook, as it could mean people could vote twice.

I'd love to hear any of your suggestions and comments on ways the infographic could be improved!
Thanks for your time!

&gt;Labour’s less aggressive deficit-cutting targets would require ""a mere £1bn"" in further spending cuts over the next parliament, if Ed Balls can achieve his aim of raising an extra £7.5bn through tax avoidance measures.

&gt;Instead of aiming for an overall budget surplus [...] Balls will allow himself to borrow in order to fund investment. But the IFS did caution that Labour have been ""considerably more vague about how much they would want to borrow"".

And on the SNP:

&gt;The IFS also cast doubt on the Scottish National party’s anti-austerity rhetoric, saying that public spending under the SNP’s plans would be “essentially the same” as Labour.

&gt;[...]

&gt;According to the IFS’s analysis, the SNP’s plans amount to the same as Labour’s - but it would continue cutting after 2018-19, so that by the end of the parliament, it would actually be spending less than Labour.

&gt;The IFS’s Gemma Tetlow said these plans: ""seem to be significantly at odds"" with the SNP’s anti-austerity rhetoric.

I suppose she might have added that Labour's plans: ""seem to be significantly at odds"" with their pro-austerity rhetoric!

EDIT: And the IFS also state that  ""There are genuinely big differences between the main parties’ fiscal plans. The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice"", which is refreshing!

In this context, has there *ever* been an example of an echo chamber that has produced positive results for more than the first 5 minutes?

Because every one I've seen simply degenerates into a competition to be the most purest *whatever*, with people being cast out for being unworthy or not committed enough. 

&gt;Secondly people with privilege often don't seem to understand just how much of a echo chamber society is as a whole for them and get upset when they see specific groups get what they feel are ""special treatment"" that is in reality something so common place in their world view they've forgotten they already have it.

Where? Again taking this example as the basis, the last men's spaces were all but wiped out as being misogynist in the 90s. The last ""white"" spaces pretty much ceased to exist around the same time that laws were introduced to bar such discrimination. Barring Blacks, Irish and dogs is considered poor form these days. 

&gt;You also completely misunderstand the function of Reddit, which is to create subreddits as subcommittees based around given topic. In fact if you read site FAQ it will spell that out for you and how those subcommunites require moderation to keep them on topic.

Even if he does misunderstand, the point about people cloistering themselves away from opposing ideas is still relevant. Even prior to Reddit the same behaviour was observed over the larger internet. Hell, even daring to look and consider other points of view in some sections will mark you as unusual these days.

&gt;In TwoX case if they banned guys from the sub you'd have the same shitstorm here but allowing everyone in and get upset with arseholes trying to drive it off the topic it was created to discuss is ""acting frumpy"".

Err, you seem to be making some pretty large leaps here. Having a sub allow for differing viewpoints on a given topic does not in any way imply a free for all regarding the topics themselves.

An event which invites only people who have been victimised by racism against BME people is of course entitled to do that.

It's uncontroversial in society that men don't go into the women's bathroom, and vice versa.

Are there leagues of men who think it's outrageous that they're being banned from parts of public buildings because of their gender? The principle is transferable.

It also meant I had to be on the 7am train to be in the office before 9. That meant getting up at 6:15 in order to be showered and walk to the station.

So to get 8 hours sleep I had to be in bed by 10:15. That meant about 90 minutes of free time at home per weekday. Much of which was spent cooking, doing dishes, laundry, etc.

It played havoc with my physical condition and my marriage, and I don't even have children. It lasted a year, and we moved to Southwark. Now my life is much more enjoyable. I even have time to do things like go to the gym in the morning, and spend time with my wife. Turns out she's not a bad sort.

null,false,hotcod,null,null,null,"&gt;In this context, has there ever been an example of an echo chamber that has produced positive results for more than the first 5 minutes?

Almost all subreddits are echo chambers to a grater or less extent, any one who posts in a sport or hobby subreddit is largely going to agree with everyone else that posts there that it's a fun worth while thing. They will also largely take badly to some one coming in from outside the community to tell them what they enjoy doing is stupid. 

&gt;Because every one I've seen simply degenerates into a competition to be the most purest whatever, with people being cast out for being unworthy or not committed enough.

Forming groups based on shared values is fundamental human behaviour and most of that works out just fine.

&gt;Where? Again taking this example as the basis, the last men's spaces were all but wiped out as being misogynist in the 90s. The last ""white"" spaces pretty much ceased to exist around the same time that laws were introduced to bar such discrimination. Barring Blacks, Irish and dogs is considered poor form these days.

Thank you for being a perfect example of the kind of person I was talking about. I'm honestly not sure how to engage with you over this if you honesty think that no male spaces exist or that the common social and political spaces are still not overwhelming more welcoming to males and whites than any other group. 

&gt;Even if he does misunderstand, the point about people cloistering themselves away from opposing ideas is still relevant. Even prior to Reddit the same behaviour was observed over the larger internet. Hell, even daring to look and consider other points of view in some sections will mark you as unusual these days.

Minority groups have to content with being a minatory group *all the time* and sometimes they may just want a space in which they can exist with out having to justify or explain themselves to the majority. This does not inherently have to lead to groups becoming completely closed off but if the majority keep insisting on having the right to insert themselves into those spaces you shouldn't be surprised that it provokes a reaction to close ranks. 

&gt;Err, you seem to be making some pretty large leaps here. Having a sub allow for differing viewpoints on a given topic does not in any way imply a free for all regarding the topics themselves. Nothing he said even remotely implies such. 

That is... fair enough. I was somewhat putting words in his mouth at that point to underline the point about how Reddit actually works and how that runs counter to the things he was suggesting about the TwoX. I could have made the point in a much better and fairer way. 

&gt;One can have a structured, dedicated sub without it becoming an echo chamber.

And party leaders and even Prime Ministers don't need to be MPs. But I concede your point, I'm not sure to what degree people are aware of that.

I don't think there's technically anything wrong with party leadership not being conducted by an elected MP. That's the case with both the Green Party and UKIP currently. Not to mention the 6 SNP MPs currently sitting in Westminster.

&gt;She won't be representing the SNP in Westminster at all; will Salmond be leading the charge, or end up in Cabinet if there's a coalition involving the SNP?

Regarding this point, Labour has gone to lengths to state they won't go into coalition. So assuming they stick to that, I wouldn't expect SNP MPs in cabinet. I don't think either party would want that, given how the SNP campaign was to some extent based on ejecting Labour from Scotland - I think it'd be seen as a betrayal of values.

Can to play in midfield alongside Henderson. Moreno pushed into a left midfield, he's quick and good at slide tackling, but he's not as defensively sound as he needs to be at times.
I don't ever want to see Markovic playing as a right wing back again, he's a runner on the ball but not a tackler. His 20m tag, and preferred position needs to get respected more by the club.

Borini, Allen and Lovren should be sold. 
Origi, together with Depay should come in. Rossiter and other young players should be given a chance in the first team too.

I think they may have tried to ease the food/water situation a bit in order to try and get to a more interesting point in their development as a group/society. If they have more water (eg the extra coconuts that have been planted; the wells made in advance) then they spend less time just surviving and more time building and/or crafting things. Less problems with baseline food source makes for greater possibilities to develop hunting techniques, more exploring and such.

Making each series a simple repeat isn't going to keep the TV viewers interest. Also if all the expedition group of women hadn't foundy handy coconuts on the two beaches then they'd all have been out in the first few days.

Sterling's finishing isn't as bad as people on here like to think, how many people were bitching about it last season? his record was very impressive. But now he's our main man with a shit ton of pressure and it's clearly effecting him, no 19/20 year old should have this amount of pressure on them.


Balotelli &amp; Borini are both underrated on here, strikers in general need a run of games and whilst Balotelli had a bit of a run at the start of the season (albeit only a couple weeks) that was whilst we were in a very poor period. Last time Borini had a run  of games  as a striker was at Roma when he was banging them in for fun.

Coutinho will never be an elite CAM unless he's playing for a team like Madrid/Barcelona with 2/3 major goal threats in front of him since he's not really a goal threat himself. As Rodgers said he's more of a Modric type of player who sits behind the CAM but for some reason he hasn't been played like that this season.

We'll miss Gerrard and Johnson this summer, our squad is extremely young and we're going to lack experience when they leave.

Signing a top striker this summer would be retarded unless he can play a few other positions, what are we going to do when Sturridge is fit (and he will be for 50%+ of the season)? play 2 strikers when we have Lallana, Ibe, Sterling, Markovic and Coutinho all competing for 1 position in a 41212? so Lacazette/Depay/Walcott etc would be ideal.

They will also largely take badly to some one coming in from outside the community to tell them what they enjoy doing is stupid.

The difference between an echo chamber and a sub that allows for diverse discussion is in how differences of opinion are handled. Having a common interest does not mean that they will have the same opinion on a given facet. Is there a risk of becoming an echo chamber in any given sub? Absolutely, the smartly run subs actively fight against that happening because once it does, they tend to collapse. Just like old school forums before them did. 

&gt;Thank you for being a perfect example of the kind of person I was talking about. I'm honestly not sure how to engage with you over this if you honesty think that no male spaces exist

Again putting words in peoples mouths. You really, seriously need to stop that. I said ""all but wiped out"", back in the 90s there were massive campaigns to force male only spaces to allow women into them. Gentlemen's clubs bore the brunt of that assault but it continues to this day. The only men's only space I'm aware of existing anywhere in the UK is a barbers shop in Manchester (IIRC) that explicitly forbids women from staying. By all accounts it's making an absolute killing. Everywhere else is unisex with varying degrees of welcome. 

&gt;or that the common social and political spaces are still not overwhelming more welcoming to males and whites than any other group.

That's different from a space that actively bars entry. 

&gt;Minority groups have to content with being a minatory group all the time and sometimes they may just want a space in which they can exist with out having to justify or explain themselves to the majority.

Have I argued otherwise? I don't think I have. Just to be clear, my one and only issue is in them calling such a thing ""inclusive"" (I consider the use of that word for an event that is by it's very nature exclusive to be downright Orwellian). I also frankly find the idea that having all these different minority groups under one roof would be all that useful to be dubious, given that many of any given group's issues are (beyond the broadest sense) relevant only to that group as will be solutions to them, but that's just me. 

&gt;I'd like to see an example of a subs that you think match this description.

1. Your vote has a duration of 5 years. Perpetuating FPTP does more harm in the long-run for your own representation and democracy than any benefit your vote could have in that 5 years. The next government only has 5 years to ruin us, FPTP has forever.

2. Voting systems are powered by participation. The more people participate in a voting system, the more credibility it has. No participation? No credibility. Participation perpetuates FPTP.

3. The two things that make FPTP look bad most of all are hung parliaments (because FPTP is meant to avoid those) and low turnout. We're almost guaranteed a hung parliament, therefore the best thing you can do to bring down FPTP is produce as low a turnout as possible.

Spoiling your ballot does nothing to contribute to the downfall of FPTP. There's nothing about a spoilt ballot that's ever recorded (regardless of what you write on it) as a dissatisfaction with the system. It's generally regarded as dissatisfaction with the parties on offer.

null,false,Liverpoolbadger,null,null,null,"Personally, I dont think we will be actually *spending* much on transfer fees [To make it clear I mean spending numerous transfer fees on players, i.e. buying more than 3 players]

**To leave**

* Glen Johnson

* Steven Gerrard

* Borini - 5 to 7 million

* Lambert - 1 to 2 million

* Aspas - 2 million

I think we will keep Balotelli for 1 more season and have 4 strikers for the season. Especially due to the injury problems/scoring issues we have had.

**To come in**

* Striker
    I would like **Lacazette** personally. I feel he would be able to come for around 30-35 million but we would not be short on competition for his signing.
    If we cannot get Lacazette we should be ballsy and go for 
**Aubemayang** or **Dybala**. I think Reus is less realistic an option. 3 chances to get 1 quality striker.

* **DM**
I think we should go for Illaramendi whilst keeping Lucas. This will give us a solid cover for DM issues, not to mention Illara is young and I think he still has potential.

* **RB**
A lot of people think this is an issue but with Flanno and Manquillo [who I think can be good players there] as well as Brendan using Can in there at times, we have decent cover.

* **LB**
If Enrique leaves then I think we should defo go for a LB. I really really like **Rodriguez** from Wolfsburg. He is having a wonderful season as are Wolfsburg so not sure how realistic it may be. If we cant go for him I wouldn't mind seeing **Coentrao** or **Alex Sandro**, Coentrao being the more realistic IMO.

**Free**

Milner

Ings

Ayew OR Konoplyanka [Not both]

I think those 2/3 buys and 3 frees will give us a quality squad as well as first team, whilst at the same time reducing pressure on Sterling/Hendo/Coutinho to consistently provide. Will also give us the chance to loan out youngsters like Ibe.

&gt;Using a different data series, British Election Survey micro data, we are able to show overall selfreported turnout rates and a breakdown by social class where this information is available. [..] Where data are available in 1983, 1992, 1997 and 2005 we find a social class gradient with the professional and managerial classes more likely to vote than the partly skilled and unskilled classes. In 2005 [..] 67% of individuals in Class V [unskilled workers] voted in the general election compared to 85% of individuals in Class I [professionals]. 

And:

&gt;Although not directly comparable due to differences in data collection and classification scheme, information from Ipsos MORI24 (who conduct many political polls) provides some evidence of turnout in the May 2010 general election. Turnout for individuals in Social Grade25 AB was 76% compared with 57% in Social Grade DE.

null,false,hotcod,null,null,null,"&gt;The difference between an echo chamber and a sub that allows for diverse discussion is in how differences of opinion are handled. Having a common interest does not mean that they will have the same opinion on a given facet. Is there a risk of becoming an echo chamber in any given sub? Absolutely, the smartly run subs actively fight against that happening because once it does, they tend to collapse. Just like old school forums before them did.

But all subreddits still have a topic and bounds in which that topic is being discussed. TwoX is a place about women, men bringing up their issues there isn't about creat 

&gt;Again putting words in peoples mouths. You really, seriously need to stop that. I said ""all but wiped out"", back in the 90s there were massive campaigns to force male only spaces to allow women into them. Gentlemen's clubs bore the brunt of that assault but it continues to this day. The only men's only space I'm aware of existing anywhere in the UK is a barbers shop in Manchester (IIRC) that explicitly forbids women from staying. By all accounts it's making an absolute killing. Everywhere else is unisex with varying degrees of welcome.

&gt;That's different from a space that actively bars entry.

&gt;Have I argued otherwise? I don't think I have. Just to be clear, my one and only issue is in them calling such a thing ""inclusive"" (I consider the use of that word for an event that is by it's very nature exclusive to be downright Orwellian). I also frankly find the idea that having all these different minority groups under one roof would be all that useful to be dubious, given that many of any given group's issues are (beyond the broadest sense) relevant only to that group as will be solutions to them, but that's just me.

And now you are putting words in mine. I've clearly stated in my first post in this comment chain that banning people from spaces is not something I agree with, I went to far as to call this incidents insane I think. I was just arguing that while insane there's some real, understandable problems to which this was an (over)reaction too.    There's always a danger to assuming, talking of which. 

There is also nothing in my post you replied to that suggested I was talking about female or male spaces in terms of exclusivity (I was replying to some one replying to the post in which I'd made my view on that clear) and so that was how I took your use of the term. My reply would have been diffrent if I'd known you were talking about exclusive spaces and so I'm happy to retract what was said.  

&gt;This one seems like a good start, sure, people may well get downvoted for unpopular opinions, but they don't ban people for having them or expressing them.

And if Americans kept coming here trying to take topics and talk about them in an American context you don't think they'd be banned? To quote this subreddits rules in the sidebar.

England was very much the 'default' from which the other home nations were the 'other' - it was the centre of the establishment, the equivalent to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in the USSR or west/central Turkey in the Ottomon Empire. So its identity was never formed around not being something else. The words 'England' and 'Britain' were even used interchangeably (primarily by English people, I should add) up until the 1970s. Churchill and even relatively progressive men like Orwell did it frequently. So English people's relationship with the 'British' identity was, and to a large extent still is, rather different to the Scots, Welsh or Northern Irish relationship with that identity. I think that's partly an explanation.

&gt;

&gt;__Saint George's Day__ is the [feast day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_of_saints) of [Saint George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George) and the National Day for England. It is celebrated by various Christian churches and by the several nations, kingdoms, countries, and cities of which Saint George is the [patron saint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saint). Saint George's Day is celebrated on 23 April, the traditionally accepted date of Saint George's death in 303 AD. For [Eastern Orthodox Churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church) (which use the [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar)), '23 April' currently falls on 6 May of the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar).

&gt;Since Easter often falls close to Saint George's Day, the church celebration of the feast may be moved from 23 April. In England, where it is the National Saint's Day, for 2011 and 2014 the [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism) and [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church) calendars celebrate Saint George's Day on the first Monday after the Octave of Easter (see [Easter Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Week)) (2 May 2011 and 28 April 2014, respectively).    Similarly, the Eastern Orthodox celebration of the feast moves accordingly to the first Monday after Easter or, as it is sometimes called, to the Monday of [Bright Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_Week).

Once again, barring differing opinions and barring certain topics are two different things. 

&gt;And now you are putting words in mine.

Don't think so, though it appears we may be talking at cross purposes:

&gt;There is also nothing in my post you replied to that suggested I was talking about female or male spaces in terms of exclusivity (I was replying to some one replying to the post in which I'd made my view on that clear) and so that was how I took your use of the term. My reply would have been diffrent if I'd known you were talking about exclusive spaces and so I'm happy to retract what was said.

Spoken like a gentleman. For what it's worth I apologise for my part in not being clear from the outset on this point. I suspect it would have saved a great deal of hassle. 

&gt;And if Americans kept coming here trying to take topics and talk about them in an American context you don't think they'd be banned? To quote this subreddits rules in the sidebar.

No, because I've seen them come in many times and bring their views to the table.

Maybe I was just the odd one out and they were just a bunch of juvenile homophobes?

I'm not saying it couldn't potentially be damaging for a young, confused person to hear especially if they aren't able to distinguish the intent, but I would imagine there are far more damaging things a young LGBT person might face in school and that's the whole reason I'm behind this notion that it's just a word.

As I've said before, stopping kids using it to mean 'rubbish' isn't going to stop them using it in a perjotive sense if they're that way inclined, and it's not going to stop homophobic bullying.

null,false,HashPram,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt; Can anyone do priest training and become a priest?

In theory yes, although I expect you'd find it bloody hard going if you didn't believe in god and actually had no vocation to be a priest.

First of all you've got to convince someone who has the authority to send you to seminary (i.e. a bishop or cardinal - most likely a bishop) that you have a vocation. And to do that you'll likely have to persuade your parish priest first. And that's probably going to involve getting involved in the life of your local church a fair bit - at the very least they'll expect to see you at mass a couple of times a week.

Once you've convinced someone to send you to seminary it's not a day-release thing: It's a full-on life-in-the-seminary experience, which means:

Mon-Fri
Wake up at 6, attend morning prayers;
Go for breakfast;
Lectures (varies depending on your year, but The Bible, Church dogma, Church history, Church liturgy and philosophy figured quite high on the list. Plus there's public speaking, ""how to write a sermon"". Also you'll need to attend spiritual direction with a qualified priest).
After lectures there'll be evening activities:
  Mass if it's available that day (and it's available most days)
  Helping out at a local parish (by 'helping out' I mean 'attend youth group', 'help them with their church music', get involved in the parish by visiting the sick or elderly)
  Depending on the time of year there might be additional services in the evening
  If there are seminary grounds you'll probably be asked to help maintain them a bit (cutting down hedges, cutting the grass, maintaining borders, &amp;c.)

On Sundays there's a more full-on version of mass (robes, incense, processions, a great many prayers) and then you get some time off, unless you're a deacon in which case you'll be 'shadowing' a priest (i.e. going to mass again, visiting the sick to give communion &amp;c.)

And once you're ordained (6 years) you get to be a parish priest which sounds like a cushy deal in the abstract but is actually bloody hard work in practice. It's not like some 19th century watercolour - you're going to get given a role in the diocese that's going to involve - in the case of hospital chaplain - slogging round wards visiting people who want to bend your ear, or who don't want a visit at all thanks awfully do bugger off old chap, or giving extreme unction or last rites (saying prayers with someone who's dying), then there's arranging weddings, seasonal feasts (Easter, Christmas being the obvious ones), plus you're expected to say the Liturgy of the Hours (Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, Compline), plus your church will be perpetually short of money because relatively few people attend mass these days but roofs still deteriorate at the same rate they always have, plus you can't get married so you'll be doing all this alone and trying to share your experiences with parishioners (who have their own lives to lead) or other priests (from whom you'll get some degree of cameraderie but think of it more as the reality of Father Ted - stuck dealing with your troubles with a fuckwit and/or a drunk for company, a bishop who can't stand you).

So yes. You probably could do it.
Question is: Why would you?

The community side of religion, btw, consists of people disagreeing over The Bible, which music to have at mass, which version of the liturgy, some minutiae in the parish newsletter, ""ooh my feet hurt father"", &amp;c., &amp;c.

This is more a utopian ideal than a democratic one. I might not agree with someone like Nigel Farage but in a democracy he has the right to freely discuss his views as long he's not inciting violence or racially slurring another group. He can argue his case, and in the end the people decide through their vote whether or not they agree with him. That's just the most basic democratic principle. Universities (at least for most of their history) were seen as platforms to further these principles of free speech, debate and democracy. 

Unfortunately, and this is just my opinion, these days there seems to be a mentality among certain groups of people that some topics shouldn't be discussed or certain viewpoints are deemed to be out of date or not applicable in this day and age. You can see online where some people are publicly called out for something they said, not because there was anything legally wrong with it, but because people have a moral problem with it. That mob mentality works in curtailing the rights of people to freely express whatever it is they want to say. Similarly, violence (or the threat of violence) works in shutting down free speech, and if we don't have free speech we don't have a democracy. Not only do we not have a democracy we also lose the ability to evaluate issues from all sides which limits our understanding of the world.

I think you are giving MLS (and Sporting in general) a bit of a short straw in your descriptions of its players.  Dwyer could absolutely play in the Championship if he finds his form again (which he probably will) and Zusi and Besler have been inconsistent since the World Cup primarily because of injuries.  Zusi has a great work rate and set piece delivery and is good when you want to keep possession - his game is simple passes and then solid delivery into the box when the opportunity presents itself.  Besler is an unflashy but solid CB who would fit in well at a lower PL or Championship side.

My employer just spent over £1k for someone's office chair due to medical requirements. As for the Israel thing - I believe he spent time in Palestine and came out of the trip far better informed about the situation than before - and this got to be funded by non-UK taxpayers which is even better. As for the mortgage thing... what did Stephen do wrong here? It seems if there is an issue then it is with the landlady.

I don't really know any facts - it just seems like mud slinging.

Disregarding that, they need to up their game on the transfer front, too much money wasted, and too much buying for a future that might or might not come. Buying for the future only works if i) the talent reaches its potential, and ii) if the talent sticks around. Neither of those are guarantees, so it's essentially pissing money down the drain if you can't guarantee that a player like Sterling will stick around. The way to guarantee that it so be shrewd in the transfer market, and to reach the CL consistently, and that includes not spunking £20m on Dejan Lovren and various other detritus  who make little/no positive impact.

The Hershey Process milk chocolate used in these bars is cheaper to make than other types of chocolate as it is less sensitive to the freshness of the milk.

As a result, the Hershey flavor is widely recognized in the United States, but less so internationally, in particular in areas where European chocolates are more widely available. The process is a trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed, producing butyric acid, which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation.

The Field: Lay down a synthetic turf on NFL game days.

This would obviously need to be part of the stadium architecture before it is built.

The Travel and Work Visas: Have the team front office and facilities in the US, so the players live and practice somewhere on the east coast.  Then travel to London a couple days before the game, have a Saturday practice at Enfield, play on Sunday, and back to the US on Monday.  They would only have to travel 8-10 times per year.  

Scheduling: There will only be 8-10 weeks of the year where the FA would have to schedule Spurs on the road.  NFL schedules are released before the PL season ends, so that gives the FA a few months to factor that into their scheduling.  You could also have Spurs at home on Saturday and the NFL team at home on Sunday (on weeks when there are no cup games, therefore no chance of Spurs match moving to Sunday).",null,0,null,1429802410,null,0,false,0,cqm21o1,null,t3_33l5qp,null,t1_cqm21o1,null,t1_cqlxyrc,null,null,null,1432558332,null,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6,null

&gt;Since the Conservatives’ plans imply the greatest reduction in borrowing, the Conservatives have the greatest job to do in terms of setting out how they would achieve this. Despite this, their detailed tax policies are a net giveaway of 0.1% of national income, their detailed social security measures would only provide a tenth of the cuts that they have said they want to deliver, and their commitments on aid, the NHS and schools would (relative to a real freeze) increase spending on these areas by 0.3% of national income.
&gt;The Conservatives have squared this circle with an aspiration to raise 0.2% of national income (around £5 billion) from clamping down on tax avoidance, unspecified further cuts to benefits amounting to 0.5% of national income (about £10 billion), and a further real terms cut to ‘unprotected’ departmental spending of £30 billion that was not mentioned in their manifesto. So the Conservatives need to spell out substantially more detail of how they will deliver the overall fiscal targets they have set themselves.

If you think this is coming out best then I'm amazed. Looks like £10billion of unspecified benefits cuts and £30billion of cuts to department spending also unspecified. This is absolutely useless in terms of helping people know what they are voting for and is almost anti-democratic.

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"/r/legaladviceUK is probably your best bet. However, you have not provided enough info for us to help you... 

First of all - what does your tenancy agreement say? Does it say if you wish to leave you must give notice? Does it exactly say ""move out date"" or are you paraphrasing?
See [here] (http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/private_renting/ending_a_tenancy/ending_a_fixed_term_agreement)

It is usual for a letting agent to write to you in the last couple of months asking if you want to stay - did they? Even if not it is standard practice for a tenant to confirm with a landlord in the UK - so they will be annoyed. 

Was your deposit protected? Deposits need to be protected under UK rules - you should have been given details of the scheme used when you paid it - did you? 

If you are right (yet to be established) you can raise a dispute with the deposit protection scheme, and if they judge you are right they will pay you the money. This is all done on paper, so no issue being in the US. However, there are time limits on how long you have to raise a dispute - so check now.

null,false,grogleberry,null,null,null,"&gt;On the other hand, the most successful teams against lower sides have a big focus on midfield.  Bayern and Arsenal spring to mind, strangling smaller teams midfields to totally dominate games.

I don't think that's the case.

Bayern dominate lower sides because they're better across the park. They dominate good sides too. Being dominant is pointless if you've nobody to stick it in the net. That's seldom a problem for them, with 5 players of 15+ goal a season calibre (Robben, Gotze, Lewandowski, Ribery, Muller).

It's not so much about having quality up front but goals. Arsenal always have a solid number of goals throughout the team.

Having goals from midfield helps, but very few midfielders can contribute the numbers required - Can, Henderson, Allen and whoever else we're likely to sign certainly won't.

To me, any top quality side needs the right balance of scoring and defending - that sounds obvious when you put it like that, but we've tended to fail on that front because we haven't had the money to sit on the same squad for long enough to round the it out - Rafa's lack of goals throughout the squad and Rodgers' lack of a defence last season.

Midfield, control, passing tempo - these are things you need at the very highest level but they're no substitute for not having a solid defence or enough goalscorers. You don't need them to beat shit teams that don't have the quality in defence to handle any amount of pace or individual quality.

To use an engine analogy, replacing Allen with a top quality midfielder before we make massive improvements up front would be like adding a turbo to a car with no engine.",null,0,null,1429806485,null,0,false,0,cqm4n5g,null,t3_33i443,null,t1_cqm4n5g,null,t1_cqlwny9,null,null,null,1432559556,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

We've got one team, keeping the ball all the time, launching failed attack after failed attack, most of them very easily defended. Seems pretty boring to me. Then we have another team that patiently defends, and knows exactly what types of attacks the other team will try, and stifles the players that could cause problems. It knows how to pick the right moment, attacks perfectly, and consistently scores more goals.

For myself, I believed we would be in the top 4 this season prior to the season starting, but by the time the window closed that belief pretty well fell apart.  

We mucked it up badly, there really isn't any other way around it, as it was clear we had completely failed to plan to bring in goal scorers, get a viable backup to Mignolet, get a backup to Lucas (unless one considers Can that, which I thought he was, but seeing as how he never plays there I have no idea why BR bought him).  Those, and a LB, were our clear deficiencies from the previous season (with emphasis on goal scorers after Suarez left) and the only gap we filled was at LB.  

We lost one player from last year.  One.  Yes, he would be hard to replace, but I have no idea how buying the players we did was supposed to do that at all.  Balotelli and Lambert were never going to score much, neither were Lallana or Markovic.  We had months, if not years considering Suarez tried to push his way out two summers back and even the summer before that, to plan for Suarez to leave and what we would do to replace him and it seems the only plan was Alexis Sanchez?

null,false,Messisfoot,null,null,null,"At first glance its an advantage, but I'd argue that upon further analysis, it can be a detriment to a club like ours.

Given the recent format of CL and EL, I don't think teams have gone from not playing in the EL to successfully competing at the CL. I will explain below why this is.

1. To compete for the four competitions the Top 4 teams play for, you need a squad with depth, unless the goal is to crash out at group stage a la Liverpool.

2. Unless you are the financial and brand powerhouse that is Man U, you have to work with the players that are available for the money you have disposable.

3. This means for clubs like us, we have to acquire players that are not guaranteed to be a success (unlike the players Man U bought). I don't mean it in that you reinforce aiming to fail, but you reinforce not buying the biggest names on the transfer market.

4. So when you are reinforcing, you can either buy depth all at once (like we did, or how Liverpool did this season) or add depth over time.

5. If you go with the latter (and even with the former) you need a way of bringing the new talent into the squad and let them demonstrate their transition into the team. I doubt the 3 competitions we would be in without EL would allow us enough time to transition the new players and gauge whether we should stick with that investment or cut our losses. Players would go without playing time, which is widely accepted to hurt players' performance.

So with us agreeing that we need squad depth, we can't go off buying 7 players at once, and the need for players to play in order for us to judge them and be successful when they take the field, the EL is a very important competition for our progress into the CL ranks.

That doesn't mean we have to make it an importance. But if you think about it, Bentaleb and Mason have played more games than our duds, even before being promoted to the first team by their participation in the B team. Would their progress have been the same if they spent that time on the bench or in the stands?

But I think we need to back off with some of the blame we're putting at the feet of obese people. While there is no doubt that personal healthy eating choices are going to be important to tackling the problem, we also need the kind of regulation on high sugar and high fat processed foods that we now have on tobacco products. Our grandparents were not a fat generation because they didn't eat the kind of food we eat. I mean just look at the amount of sugar in an innocuous jar of pasta sauce. It's difficult to make healthy choices when you make choices based on terrible information and no nutritional education. 

Netflix has just added ""Fed Up,"" which is a great documentary on food industry sabotage of public health, at least in the US but we aren't that different. 

EDIT: Because I am getting quite a few angry orange envelopes crying nanny state and fascism. **No I do not think we should ban or restrict cartain foods.** What I'd like to see is regulation mostly on packaging and advertising. As /u/PopeGregoryIX mentioned:

&gt;Adverts and promotions for obviously unhealthy foods are everywhere, *but what's possibly worse is the amount of adverts for unhealthy foods disguised as healthy foods.*
You've really got to keep your wits about you and if you can't cook, you're fucked.

This is the problem that needs to be tackled head on.

I will fully admit that the Tories have a blackhole. In fact, it's made me actually quite bitter about the election and campaign in general. They are lying to the general public about its finances. I can understand why they would do it (because they would be unelectable) but it does not sit well with me. The Tories are meant to be the financially sensible ones yet they are hiding.

Labour are just as bad imo. 

As a BBC report has said - this general election is full of vague promises and answers. The real answer to any finance question regarding any party is this: we just don't know.

One aspect that I found particularly interesting was the stinging criticism of senior Labour politicians (Harriet Harman, Keith Vaz and Dennis Skinner, among others) and the Labour Party's National Executive Committee at paragraphs 225 - 243. 

It appears that the NEC removed Lufthur Rahman on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations made by the man who replaced him as Labour candidate. They did this without investigation, asking Rahman for comment or even making him aware of the allegations. They did not, in fact, tell Rahman that he had been removed until a week later. They also appointed a replacement without any consultation with the Tower Hamlets Labour Party.

To quote paragraph 236 - 

&gt; Although  this  judgment  will  have  to  be  critical  of  Mr  Rahman  in  many  respects,  in  the matter of his deselection the court cannot but sympathise with him. His treatment by the NEC  was,  by  any  standards,  utterly  shameful  and  wholly  unworthy  of  the  Party  which, rightly, prides itself on having passed the Human Rights Act 1998.

Against United (and Spurs) he was anonymous in the first half and they could've scored if they were more clinical. In the second half he was better but he still didn't offer much more than bullying Fellaini. Ramos yesterday played as a destroyer in midfield but because he's technically gifted he can retain possession, make through passes, beat his man easily etc. Zouma can't because he's not very technical. I know his position for the future will be as CB but this point is still relevant because we desperately need a ball playing CB. Both JT and Cahill are not ball playing CBs like for example Varane, Ramos or Boateng, and I believe that if we want to be a big force in Europe and in the big games (domestically too), we need such CBs. They are needed to 1) play a high line to press high 2) recycle possession and keep pressuring the opponent. That's why I'm still not sure if Zouma is the best choice for us in the future.

Of course he's young and can improve on that aspect of the game like he already has improved on his timing of jumps.

Yes, they did indeed publish an article from Paul Dacre and I completely acknowledge (and have acknowledged elsewhere in this thread) that The Guardian will allow 'the enemy' to write a piece from time to time.  Still - I don't think this fairly rare occurrence makes up for the fact that in their day to day operations, they appear to generally solicit opinions from a fairly narrow range on some topics.

Rainham is rough round the edges and traditionally not great, but was on enough of an ""up"" when I lived in south Essex that it was in danger of becoming quite nice.

However, all of these teams aren't likely to replicate these mistakes again next season. Arsenal are finding consistency with some really good football. Van Gaal has brought structure to the way United play and it's starting to show. Chelsea are Chelsea. City  are up in the air somewhat now but if a new manager comes in and gets those world class players firing again then they'll improve. Southampton can be shrewd in the transfer market and have no serious expectations hanging over them. Tottenham, well it's Tottenham, they'll probably find a way to balls it up.

If you look at every squad sitting ahead of us right now, there isn't a person on the planet that would argue our squad is better than theirs or that if we had spent more ""shrewdly"" it could be. 

Of the two teams we were most likely to fight for 4th with, one beat us to the best attacking player we could have afforded because he liked their location better (and also, although this never gets discussed, because he probably didn't want to be compared to the guy who forced him out of the Barca side in Suarez). The other dropped more than we spent on a whole host of squad players for Luke Shaw, DiMaria, and Ander Herrera. Of which only Herrera has proven decently important to them in the last half of the season.

When we're competing with that sort of thing for 4th, there is no way you can fire a manager for not getting CL in 1 out of 3 seasons. 

And who are all these idiots who are talking about a ""trophy"" when if we won the FA Cup we'd still look back on a failure to qualify for CL as more important. Trophies only really matter at this stage when they're the PL and CL. League Cups are a nice aside, mostly for the video clips and pictures of the trophy ceremony. Winning the FA Cup generally tends to mean you beat a lower league side. If it once meant something, it doesn't any longer. 

What gets people fired is not getting CL and right now we're 4 fucking points off it. If we finished the season at that many points off and you consider that we were without Sturridge, Lallana, Lucas, among other important shorter term injuries, for much of the season, anyone would be crazy to SUGGEST sacking Rodgers.

Should we have handled it better? Yes. Absofuckinglutely. But I wouldn't say so much better as not scraping it through. 

Brendan had Balotelli forced on him (that's just a fucking fact) and he tried to give the guy a chance at the start of the season. At the very least he must have hoped that Balo's European experience might be of some use to the rest of a squad collectively deprived of CL experience.

Done!

1. Cultural diversity did not make this possible. In fact if anything it was cultural homogeneity that made this possible - that, coupled with lax regulations supposed to prevent this sort of malfeasance that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything cultural. It seems ""cultural diversity"" is just a term you use all the time but forgot to check the meaning of on this occasion. However...
2. Certain ethnic minorities absolutely did make this possible, as without the consolidation of certain ""old country"" networks, Rahman would never have been able to do the things he did... in the exact way he did them. It is of course completely obvious that since South Asian politicians have been elected up and down the country and managed not to be corrupt, and politicians of other ethnicities (including white Brits) have been fabulously corrupt without having to be Bangladeshi - the phrase ""Certain ethnic minorities"" means absolutely fuck all.

The net of that might be CL qualification, it might not be, but is it not worth a chance? 

What are the alternatives?  We can't change FFP which means we can't invest more than we are, we can't change owners (not that it would matter really), and we can't wholesale change the players either.  The manager is realistically the only thing we can really change that can have a significant impact on results.

Will it work?  I have no idea, a new manager might fail, but they could also succeed.  It really just depends on whether you think Rodgers is the right guy to take us forward.  I personally don't and think a change is needed.  Others disagree and fair enough.

No one is claiming a change is a sure thing, it's a risk yes, but, in my opinion, the possible benefits outweigh the possible repercussions and if, in the longer term, it doesn't work, you try again, same as with any other transfer situation with players.

And deluded is not only insulting, but you're conveniently ignoring everything I've said.  I completely respect your opinion that we should keep Rodgers, but frankly I don't see that you've made any sort of case to keep him other than 'the other teams have more money than us'.

Also this is hardly something new, it's been common practice within student politics for a while and some of us have attempting to keep it that way. The problem is white males have a tendency to dominate spaces and movements. Perhaps more importantly though whiteness can never be part of an anti-racist struggle since it is the object of that struggle. This is not to say white people are racist but that [whiteness is inherently oppressive](http://racetraitor.org/abolishthepoint.html). The problem is people personalise race to the level of individual agency when in fact it is a social construct perpetuated institutionally. People on this thread pretty have no knowledge of the long history of race and cultural theory, essentially subscribing to the naturalistic assumptions on race about 100 years out of date. As organisers suggest white people can be allies, just as men can be allies to the feminist movement. The mock horror expressed here is like complaints that disabled meetings are unequal or oppressive because non-disabled people aren't invited, or that feminist conference is oppressive for not allowing men in (some people do indeed hold that opinion of course).

A woman with a shopping trolley had to be rescued after she **""disappeared"" into a hole** which had opened up in the pavement. Emergency services were called when the woman **vanished into a void** outside a cafe on North End Road in Fulham, south-west London. 

Passersby said they heard a loud scream and saw the woman had stumbled **into the 3ft-wide (1m) hole**. The woman was taken to hospital but was not seriously injured. Local workers rushed to help when the woman in her 40s **fell into the hole**, just before 09:00 BST. 

The accident happened shortly after a man **fell down the hole** and twisted his ankle. The area around the hole had been blocked off with tables and chairs, in an attempt to stop people walking into it, nearby market stall holders said. However, they added despite shouts by cafe staff, the woman who had a shopping trolley, squeezed through the chairs and **fell down the hole**. 

Mohammed Atillah, who works in the cafe, said he was outside talking to the man who stumbled earlier, when the woman walked through the makeshift barrier and **fell down the hole**. ""I could see a small hole. I put the tables and chairs so no-one would come through,"" said Mr Atillah. ""A lady was passing down the street, she came into the middle of the tables and **fell down the hole**."" 

He said he helped her to reach the floor of the basement under the cafe and she walked back up via the stairs. Council staff have now cordoned off the area.

I think Ivanovic has been great this season, but I think in the next season or two, we will see a sharp drop off in his game.

Additionally, we have a more than capable replacement for him in Dave. He's coming off a fantastic season so his stock is at a high and we can still get a lot of money for a player who could possibly be a second string player by the end of next season.

I'm not saying we need to sell him, in fact I'd love it if he turned into a Ferrera type back-up as the years continue, but he seems to have caught the attention of Bayern if rumors are to be believed.

I've posted elsewhere about how I feel that our current league position flatters us, given how Arsenal and Tottenham were poor at the start of the season, Southampton lost key players and got a new manager but are still a point behind.

These teams are only going to improve and if City sort themselves out then we're going to have to consistently beat mid/lower table teams *and* get decent results in most of our games against the top teams to stand a chance of top 4.

Mata left because Mourinho wouldn't play him. Most fans wanted him to stay, but understood that he didn't have a place in the team. By the time he left, he had become a fringe player and was frustrated because he wanted more than that. Both Chelsea and Mata gained something in his leaving.

Recently I have begun to lose a decent amount of weight and getting over the feeling of wanting to continue eating even after finishing a calorie controlled meal was really hard. For people that have never been used to eating healthy food, I imagine it becomes doubly hard.

The original question was skewed in a way that didn't consider simple creatures such as myself and as OP pointed out, folk can live in a bubble. My point was to say what many folk outside this community would see, obviously some of them don't know when to keep their stupid opinions to themselves and that's ended in the loss of someone's life which is a crying shame.

My views are very much do no harm, if you want to live as a woman and you're not impacting me or mine in a negative way then more power to your elbow but my original observation remains.

Whilst I realise any criticism isn't directed at me, I'll finish on a high.

Years ago I worked in a factory with a 40 strong crew of blokes who made the Met in the 70's look refined. One guy, we'll call him Bob, went through a messy divorce, had time off work and announced upon his return in a flamboyant fashion that he was a crossdresser known as Katie - The reason for his divorce.

There was piss taking, a bit of ""So does that mean he's a nonce?"" as well as a few ""Fuck it mate, if it makes you happy"".

Fast forward to the annual crew night out. A drink soaked night of utter debauchery which normally ended in a trip to A&amp;E for someone be it through fighting or drinking. Kick off was to be at 7 at the local pub.

The tale goes as follows 8pm, most of the crew are there and 3 pints deep until in walks Bob, Blonde wig, Red dress and high heels looking like Albert Steptoe in drag and starts ordering his drink - This attracts the attention of a couple of the pub's less enlightened clientèle.

""Look you dirty tranny, you can either fuck off and get a hiding in the car park or stay and we'll knock fuck out of you right here"" says one.  A mountain called Scott wanders over and explains to the gentlemen ""He might be a dirty tranny, but he's our dirty tranny"".

Almost as one, a gaggle of the roughest cunts you've seen invite the two fellows to stand by their convictions. Needless to say their arses fell out and Katie was escorted, with G&amp;T, to the crew by Scott.

&gt; The only way you can sustain the myth that Labour was fiscally profligate is by suggesting that immediately before the recession the UK was experiencing a massive boom.

No, the only way you can sustain the fact that Labour was fiscally profligate is by suggesting that immediately before the recession the UK was increasing debt and the deficit. 

&gt; In an economic boom tax receipts are high and spending on transfers low, so the budget should be in surplus.

If we needn't have been in a massive boom this is irrelevant. 

&gt; This gets us to the key point as far as Labour profligacy is concerned. What is relevant to this issue is not what we think about the 2007 UK economy today, but what the general consensus was at the time. 

Agreed.

&gt; The actual deficits for financial years 2006-7 and 2007-8 were slightly over 2.5% of GDP... By 2009-10 the deficit had risen to 10.2% of GDP because of the recession. So the deficit in 2010 was a consequence of the recession, not Labour profligacy before the recession.

That is not what the data says either in [real terms](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/5326/economics/government-spending/) or as a [percentage of GDP](http://econ.economicshelp.org/2010/10/levels-of-government-spending-uk.html).

&gt; Labour fiscal profligacy is as mythical as the unicorn.

As well as being wrong about the above, Wren-Lewis also fails to take account of spending commitments Labour signed up to (e.g. [PFI](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/05/pfi-cost-300bn)) I'd also refer you to the [summary here](http://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn92.pdf) which details Gordon Brown's efforts to develop a client state through government spending and [here for a more broad brush analysis](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/5509/economics/government-spending-under-labour/)",null,0,null,1429816523,null,0,false,0,cqmbcil,null,t3_33lxxb,null,t1_cqmbcil,null,t3_33lxxb,null,null,null,1432562785,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I completely disagree with this.

There's a stigma about smoking in the UK that is almost non-existent amongst many of our neighbours.

Similarly, look at the difference in attitudes towards drink-driving between here and the US. I don't know a single person in their right minds who would drive drunk, but it's depressingly common in America.

Demonisation may be harsh, but it works. You aren't gonna get people to quit their bad habits by being nice about it.

I have always thought the reason for this subreddit was for discussion on your Chelsea opinions. This is not a /r/JoseMourinhoIsGod subreddit. Let me quickly bring up Zouma v Cahill, many people including myself we're asking for the switch to be made sooner. Cahill was making rash (perhaps complacent) decisions and really underperforming compared to his own high standards. Bringing in Zouma gave Cahill the kick up the arse he needed and now i think he is nearly back to his best, putting in a decent performance against United. Anyway the opinion on dropping Cahill was split on this subreddit. Mourinho waited perhaps too long before finally shaking things up with Zouma, when he did our defence improved, Cahill was brought back in and had improved, and in this one particular case Mourinho was wrong for not doing it sooner whilst this subreddit had a small victory.  

If we really want to generate good discussion how about, just to mix things up, we reply to peoples suggestions with things other than “well Mourinho has done it yet so you must be wrong” styled replies.  

No one knows what could have happened even on the things Mourinho gets right. Say for instance we started Cuadrado up top against Man Utd and pressed high up the pitch and tried playing football. We still may have got a shock victory at home against a team starting Smalling and McNair at the back. We may have by some miracle conceded less than 3 goals against Fellaini and Ronal… I mean Ashley Young whilst still playing attacking football. We may still have won in a different fashion to how we did.

I think that the main source of the confusion is that the SNP doesn't have the usual power structure in these things where Westminster is on top and other more regional and local leaders are lower in the hierarchy. 

For the SNP, all source of political legitimacy resides in Edinburgh, not London. That's why the Westminster MPs are a forward camp rather than the centre of SNP political life. SNP people look to Edinburgh for guidance, not London.

That's not going to change. The SNP have invested too much political capital in making Edinburgh the centre of their universe to stop now. After the election, while the group of MPs down in London will be much larger, it will still be led and guided from Edinburgh. Just like it was when Alex Salmond was First Minister.

Do any of the statistical bodies collect the data across different leagues?

I find it difficult to believe that the error rate is worse in Scotland than anywhere else.

I don't think criticism of referees will solve anything here.  What should we expect when we ask a bunch of humans to referee a game? We will never get a 100% success rate using only humans, and I think most of the mistakes referees make will be honest ones.  Referees should be accountable for their actions in the sense that if they are continuously making mistakes then they shouldn't continue to get the gig. 

The only solution will be a technological one that takes the decision out of the hands of the referee whenever a mistake is identified but at the same time doesn't impact the flow of the game.

We went on a 13 game unbeaten run at the start of the year, is that not playing to potential? Would we be fifth if not for that run? I didn't suggest we can't play some great football, but have we seen anything to suggest we can reliably maintain that consistency over the course of a season? 

Yeah we lost Suarez, we knew he was going in July and didn't get a suitable replacement, we knew Sturridge was an injury risk but pinned all hopes on him anyway. Southampton lost 39 goals and assists in Lallana and Lambert but went and replaced them with players who are scoring goals for a fraction of the money they got from Shaw, Lallana and Lovren. Can you confidently say we'll bring the right players in over summer, to keep up with the others, given our recent transfer market exploits?

I didn't say that Klopp will get us top 4 or that those challenges disappear with Klopp as manager, what I asked was whether or not there would be less frustration and backlash from fans if we missed out on top 4 in his first year or Rodgers 4th year. 

You argue that other candidates would still be available next season, fair enough, the reason I focus on Klopp is because I feel that the likelihood of another manager who fits the FSG mould so perfectly becoming available any time soon is slim to none. Can you suggest any who may? 

You are right when you say we'd be kicking ourselves if we rolled the dice too early with Rodgers, just as much as we could be kicking ourselves for passing on Klopp. The reason I favour rolling the dice on Klopp right now is because he's already proven he can do what Rodgers is trying to, and win trophies doing it. Ultimately, how long are we prepared to give Rodgers to learn how to do it? 3 years? 5? 10?

Football clubs, not just Scottish ones, need protection from malevolent owners as they are of such importance to their communities. Fans are always the ones that suffer because of this and are usually the ones that have to pick up the pieces.

On the other hand, there has to be a penalty and a deterrent for getting your finances in a mess.

I wonder if it would be feasible to have a system where the owners/board members that get a club into a bad financial state are banned from future involvement and then fan groups are given an opportunity to take ownership and put things right by paying **all** debts, bringing the club out of administration.  If they can achieve this then I don't think there should be a sporting penalty.

you make a good point though and that is why i think addressing those key areas in the market this summer are crucial, IMO...additional defensive cm's allow us to play a 4-2-3-1 with two defensive minded cm's...additional attacking cm allow us to be flexible and play 4-1-3-2/4-1-4-1. another striker who is reliable allow us to partner sturrige, balo, origi and play 4-4-2 diamond again. the added midfielders also allow us to play a traditional 4-3-3 because what we really need when we play that way is athletic, strong players who will work their socks off. finally, with ilori, sahko, skrtel and lovren (even wisdom or lloyd jones will get some games probably) we can play with 3 at the back and play it damn well. 

so im excited by the prospect of next season post transfer window. i know there's always the risk we'll lose lucas and raheem (being the only two players i think would be pretty big blow) but lucas is replacable and raheem leaving would mean we'd get a ludicrous amount of cash for him, upwards of 40-50m..stoopid money for someone so unproven at the highest level, and stoopid money to pay for potential, but i guess that's what happened with lucas moura and neymar (neymar more of a finished article, higher ceiling) in theory, but i wouldn't believe it if someone stumped up 50m for him. 

edit: here's the other thing, as cliche as this sounds, lallana, sahko, flanno, studge all coming back healthy feels like 4 new signings, as does the return of ilori, wisdom, ojo, and in my mind, teixeira/alberto. these guys all have massive qualities that can help us, it's time to see who we axe and who we buy...",null,0,null,1429821251,null,0,false,0,cqmeibj,null,t3_33liv5,null,t1_cqmeibj,null,t1_cqmcwvh,null,null,null,1432564345,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

1) I've never liked oscar or willian And they've never impressed me. I Don't think they should have such an important role in our squad. I don't have the confidence in them to rely on them in most games. I also think ramires is being restricted in his ability by the role he gets handed sometimes. He was really good for us his first 2 seasons, then his role changed and so did his performance. 

2) Jose mourinho is an absolute genius and tactical mastermind, but I feel that he can only work with talent that has been set up for him or talent that he brings. Under mourinho we will never see a good amount of the youth players really make it big. Maybe 1, 2, or 3 of them but I can't see any of them being world class. My dream is for chelsea to one day have a squad like Barcelona's a couple years ago where most of their team was home grown and they were regarded as one of them best teams of all time. We have the potential. We basically have the best youth in Europe and they might all just go to waste. We're actually very fortunate to have the youth that we have. I can name you more than 100 clubs that would kill to take in the youth that we have and develop them. 

3) I understand that most of our success has came because of the money we've spent but it honestly annoys me sometimes that every transfer window,  we pick up some expensive talent. Why can't we just work with what we have? I see Buying crazy expensive talent as only a short term fix to some of our problems. We need to start looking long term. I can't think of a position where we need dire help. I saw carragher's quote the other day and It kinda got to me. He may be regarded as an asshat analyst, but that quote really just put me kinda down. He Something like ""mourinho's team will always be respected but never loved"". I want to be loved. We can't keep ""ruining football"" as the haters say it. Yea we're having an above average season (for our standards) but what happens wen he have a bad one? We're gonna thrown down a billion euros in thé transfer market? Cmon now

null,false,iRoygbiv,UnionFlag,Street Triple R,null,"To be honest the thing that helped me most was having an awkward pain in the ass bike for 6 months!!!

I got a YZF R125, which if you haven't ridden one is uncomfortable as hell, has a very high seat, is not very stable and has an awful steering lock. Plus mine was constantly stalling. So when I sat on a 600cc bike it was so stable it felt like I was sitting on a brick wall by comparison. The U turn and other slow speed manoeuvres were incredibly easy, significantly easier than when I did them for my CBT. The big bikes want to stay upright rather than wanting to tip you off!

Mod 2 I think is more about luck unfortunately. There is a lot of subjectivity around ""was that gap too small"", ""was going through that Amber dangerous or not?"" That sort of thing. However, what I heard time and time again was that bike examiners are much more sensible that the ones who do car tests. By which I mean they are more interested in whether you can actually ride and don't like it if they get the impression you ""studied for the test"" are just doing things (like observations) for their benefit rather than because you actually need to do them. This is kinda a double edge sword though... It means that if they think you are confident, stable, have good control of the bike, make decent observations. In other words if you appear comfortable and natural on the bike then they are very likely to turn a blind eye to things that technically would be a fault as they know you're a good rider and that in the real world you never do everything exactly perfect. The other edge of the sword is that if you don't give them that ""comfortable-on-a-bike' impression they may actually look for petty things to fail you on. 

So in summary, I think it's actually very valuable to ride for a few months, or as long as you can, on an awkward manual 125cc (doesn't have to be a YZF, a CBF or YBR while not as bad are still unstable in comparison to a big bike) before doing the DAS as it will make you so much more comfortable, which counts for a lot on both Mod 1 and Mod 2.

null,false,myfootballaccount,rangers,,null,"&gt; I'm saying that, more often than I'd like, we've seen games be completely changed based on a dodgy decision that should not have been made.

But that's the thing, errors during a football match will always happen. Goalkeepers will let the ball slip through their gloves, defenders will score own goals, midfielders will make a sloppy backpass, strikers will miss open goals... referees will make mistakes too. 

If a player continuously makes errors, they should be dropped and no longer selected. The same should apply to referees.

&gt; It seems like there is no structure in place to hold officials accountable for a mistake which can change the course of a game so dramatically.

I don't think a referee should have to face the public and feel their wrath when they make a mistake.  They do a difficult job that isn't going to win them many friends, but someone has to do it. Using technology to override an erroneous decision would solve this but in the absence of any such implementation we are simply stuck with referees and their occasional errors.

For example, your credit card transactions may download in a different format to your current account transactions. Also, some products do not have an export to csv function but only a pdf display which you would then need to parse. 

Then when it comes to categorising the transactions, you will also need to set up rules for that. For you personally it will probably be easy to link transactions to budget categories. But if you are thinking of converting to an app for others you'll need an easy way for other people to assign categories to transactions and allow your app to learn to categorise.

I'd suggest writing the app for yourself and the bank you use and then seeing if you want to take it further.

Don't get me wrong he hasn't been perfect by any means, but the reason there has been such a drop from last season is because other clubs have gotten better as we have gotten worse. In my opinion, this worsening hasn't had much to do with Rodgers, but more to do with Suarez's departure. The little Uruguayan is quite simply one of the best players in the world besides Messi and Ronaldo. If we are going to be brutally honest, our performance in the last few seasons has not warranted us one of the best players in the world so with Barca being Suarez's dream club, there's nothing Rodgers could have done about him leaving.

However, what Rodgers has done is basically reformat much of the squad. He's spent as many of us agreed was wise throughout summer, building a 'long term squad.' 8 months is certainly not long term. I honestly believe that many of the players he has bought will come good and provide us with solid foundations for the future of our club rather than one star player. If you doubt me, take a look at Henderson, until last season he was slated beyond belief and is now seen as one of our star players. Go figure.

It just seems like everybody is comparing Rodger's managerial ability to one stand out season, which although was influenced by his tactics, was largely perfected by Suarez's talent and Gerrard's passion to go out on a high (in my opinion). It is evident that he *is* tactically great, despite his young age. He's had a couple of learning curves, and I bet if he were to replay the Chelsea game at the end of last season, he'd hold out for a draw rather than chase the win. Honestly, I think we have such a great young manger who could become one of the best in the world in the next decade. We just have to give him the time he needs. I can't think of anything worse than him being hounded out by fans, only to move to another club and completely revolutionise them.

Also, to everybody begging for Klopp, don't get me wrong, he is a great manager, but look at the drop from last season to this season! To all you knocking Rodgers' performance this season, how would react if we're 24 points worse off this time next season than we are now? Because that's exactly how Dortmund stand right now.

TL;DR In my opinion, Rodgers is the best manager for the club even though the results and players performance may not show it at the minute, however, I think it will happen.",null,0,null,1429822547,null,0,1429822784,0,cqmfcko,null,t3_33lyil,null,t1_cqmfcko,null,t3_33lyil,null,null,null,1432564741,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

Charles Stanley currently charges 0.25% which is good for smaller amounts. The minimum trade is £500 if buying new units.

I am sure I do not need this £1000. I have additional cash coming in from my summer job this year (about £1200) that I will save for university alongside the loans and grants I will receive. However, if I was able to invest less than £1000 I would but I am yet to find somewhere that accepts less. (Edit : I will take a look at Charles Stanley if they allow £500 because that's more suited to me)



I have chosen the S&amp;P 500 mainly because it is the one that I understand the most. I feel that when I am just starting out it would be best to invest in something that I know a lot about. I do also know a lot about the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 but I don't feel that the returns match the S&amp;P 500.


I am very much on board with the Bogle idea of not trading often and so I would want to hold something like the S&amp;P 500 or a Technology ETF for a very long time as I believe that these will both go up a lot over the course of 30+ years.


My time frame is 30+ years. I want to open this account and add small amounts throughout university (perhaps £3 a day).

Not sure if it's the right game for Gallagher, I'd like to see him play again on the wing, over Tadic who has looked bright at places but also poor, and Long who's been a little lackluster recently, this could be the sort of game where he wants to prove himself into the first team, that being said, all the talks about Gallagher, yet no-one mentions Seager.

null,false,00700700,null,null,null,"Okay just a few things to think about. I'm being careful to avoid giving investment advice, but please consider these first:

&gt; I am sure I do not need this £1000. I have additional cash coming in from my summer job this year (about £1200) that I will save for university alongside the loans and grants I will receive. However, if I was able to invest less than £1000 I would but I am yet to find somewhere that accepts less.

University and immediate living costs afterwards require money. Unless your family is going to be providing you with 5-10k a year, there is a reasonable chance that you will need that 1k. When you graduate, you will need an emergency fund. Have you considered that? Having that cash readily available after university is a godsend for many graduates. 

Have you considered any post-grad qualifications? Are you considering Masters? 

&gt; I have chosen the S&amp;P 500 mainly because it is the one that I understand the most. I feel that when I am just starting out it would be best to invest in something that I know a lot about. I do also know a lot about the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 but I don't feel that the returns match the S&amp;P 500.

Again, I'm not trying to offend you. Why do you think you know more about the S&amp;P500 index? I totally agree you should only invest in things you know about. For what reason do you think the S&amp;P500 will beat the FTSE? What knowledge do you have that others do not? Why doesn't everyone invest in the S&amp;P if you feel the 'FTSE returns do not match it'? [Have you considered world trackers instead?](http://monevator.com/how-to-chooose-total-world-equity-trackers/)

&gt; Technology ETF 

Again this feels a little unfair, but you need to really understand what you are doing. I'll be honest £1,000 is not a massive investment compared to most, but you should try and research and learn before undertaking any such investment. Why in particular would you hold Technology ETF? Have a read up of the 'Modern Portfolio Theory' and diversification. 

&gt; I know that I won't spend that money in University so I want it to be doing something whilst I study.

Have you considered fixed interest securities, with maybe a 3 year term? Or even invest in bonds ETF/OEIC through a platform?

I don't have a perfect reason for why I think the S&amp;P 500 will do best I just see it as having a good combination of risk, reward and enticement as I find it interesting.

Yes I do understand diversification.

I know I say ""I think"" but that's all really anyone does. Yes they are have more educated guesses than me but only because they have experience and that's what I'm trying to gain from doing this.

I have not considered fixed interests or bonds. I shall have a look though.

Yes you can. However, there is no guarantee of the state of the market when you wish to withdraw the money. Ideally you want the capital as in liquid form as reasonably possible for an emergency fund. 

Lets say the markets have just crashed, and you suddenly need the money? Do you crystalise that loss, or alternatively use some other funds set aside as a designated emergency fund that will not immediately damage your wealth? 

Again you need to remember this is a relatively small sum in the scale of things, however it is a good size to act as an emergency fund at the end of university. 

&gt; However, I think that it is inevitable that Technology will increase more over 30+ years than a portfolio that has exposure to real estate, cash, bonds, different countries, commodities etc.

If you accept you are using this as a 'learning experience', or as a 'bit of risky fun' that is fine. If your only goal is absolute return, you should look at any investment more objectively. 

However, consider why the majority total growth funds are not wholly invested in technology stocks? A: because diversification is key. Think about it for a second, these are fund managers on six figure salaries, what do you know that these guys do not?

As mynameisdads said, pretty much anywhere is great, in my experience! But I know how intimidating it can be at first.

The main problems are midgies and finding somewhere dry/flat enough to pitch your tent. Look for windy spots to deal with first problem. Altitude also helps, as midgies are rubbish fliers, thank goodness! And pitch your tent late afternoon, rather than waiting for them to wake up in the evening and swarm you as you're fighting with your guy ropes. Avoid those cosy looking spots in the trees next to streams... The second problem is best solved by having a small tent footprint, imho.

Some more easy spots by public transport include just behind the Kings House pub/hotel at the entrance to Glencoe. Fantastic views. Lovely flat grassy place to pitch next to the stream (windy so not too midged) and lovely pub for the evenings :) It gets busy there though, so don't go expecting solitude, but depending on what you're looking for on a particular trip, it can be ideal. The citylink bus goes past it every couple of hours and there's great walking round about.

**Warning: Controversial**

This ""conscience clause"" was proposed when a deeply religious baker was made to create a ""pro-gay"" cake.

A man who, in his heart, truly believes that if he promotes a gay lifestyle that he will burn in eternal hell fire and disgrace his God. This emotional trauma all so someone could get a cake? Is this really what a liberal society stands for? What is to stop me from forcing a Muslim baker inscribing ""I love pork! Drink alcohol!"" on a cake?  The DUP claimed that there is no longer any room for Christian views in society so argued that people should be able to deny business if it is at odds with their religious views.


Try to look at things impartially and to truly understand why people hold the views they do. It makes you see opinions as opinions and not blind hatred. It makes life a lot easier.

null,false,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"To ensure fair treatment of students by the university. Imagine for example, if a particularly corrupt lecturer blackmailed a student into having sex with them (a sort of ""fuck me if you want a decent grade""), and the university was covering it up. Or if lecturers were discriminating against students based on their race, economic background, gender, or sexuality. The students' union are there to ensure this bullshit doesn't happen.

Of course, more realistically, their purpose is mainly support. For example, if a student suddenly finds themselves in a dire situation with nowhere to turn to (like their parents died, or they lost all their money), a SU can help them with negotiations for securing emergency funding or special considerations by the university.

To give a picture of the kind of services a SU provides, the SU of my university provides the following:

* A counselling service (though admittedly its more of a helping people to find the right places to get more professional counselling)

* A legal advice service (designed to help students understand their rights and point them towards solicitors if they have legal issues)

* A letting agency (they set up an estate agency which prescribes to the principle of never charging letting fees, simply acting as intermediary between the tenant and the landlord. They also maintain a blacklist to make students aware of dodgy landlords who they should avoid)

* A nightbus service for ensuring people get home safely after a night out

* Support in finding a job (which is usually done in conjunction with the university's own career service) including hosting careers fairs (you know where companies looking for employees send people to advertise the job and find interested people)

* Supporting students in the appeals process (if a student feels their result was unfair for example)

* Provides a student radio/magazine and TV services that any student can volunteer to take part in (this is more on the extra-curricular side, but given we are one of the few students union radio services with an FM license, volunteering for the student radio is like working with a real radio service, and therefore students looking to go into radio get a step firmly on the ladder (someone I know didn't actually complete their degree, they worked with the student radio service 2 and a half years, eventually quit their degree and then got hired as a BBC researcher)

* Sports and societies - partly because students need to have fun as well, but like above about getting experience (someone in the debate society might end up going into politics on the back of that experience, someone in the drama society might end up working in real theatre on the back of putting on uni productions etc.)

* Lobbies the university (SU representatives are present at every university council meeting) to get across student interests (for example, they managed to convince the university to allow the on-campus libraries to remain open 24/7 during exam periods, and to open additional study rooms. They've also consistently informed the university where lecture halls needs to approved (in terms of accessibility, size and acoustics). ^And, ^of ^course, ^being ^rather ^green ^ensuring ^the ^university ^installs ^enough ^recycling ^bins ^around ^campus )

Now I think the NUS (as in the national union of students) is a pile of unrepresentative tosh that needs to be scrapped but the local student unions have a positive impact on the university experience.

EDIT: One other thing I should add is that whilst the political side of our SU is still very much left-wing, the crazies thankfully left two years ago (and from what I can tell, are now elected in NUS positions), and the SU is now dominated mainly by people who, whilst feminist and left-wing, are actually have constructive discussion about issues such as the lack of disabled ramps on campus, steps to reduce alcohol abuse, how to tackle the issue of sexual harassment of students, and tackling rising costs of student housing.

EDIT2: Should also add our SU actually considered ending its NUS membership (thus become an independent SU). Though the majority of the students who cared enough to vote in the resulting referendum voted in favour of remaining a member (mainly because whilst every student agrees the NUS has moronic views, the various benefits that the NUS provides (in terms of student discounts, training courses for SU reps, giving a platform for inter-university SU collaboration etc.) outweighed the political bullshit.",null,0,null,1429828711,null,0,1429830950,0,cqmj0v2,null,t3_33low9,null,t1_cqmj0v2,null,t1_cqm4xds,null,null,null,1432566473,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null
