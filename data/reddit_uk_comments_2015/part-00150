They can resign any other office they hold, whenever they like; most importantly, legally speaking the PM is still a ""normal"" minister and happens to be first-among-equals. Thus they're entitled to resign their post just like any other minister is.

Prime Ministers resign when they no longer command a majority of the House, and are immediately replaced by (in an election scenario) the person the Queen appoints to be PM - hence the classic two sets of limos after a change of government, where one PM delivers their resignation in the morning, and in the afternoon the new PM-to-be goes to the Queen and is asked to form HM's Government. 

There's also the scenario where a prime minister steps down outside of an election (i.e. Thatcher in 1990), where they officially resign and are replaced in the interim by the Leader of the House until (usually bright and early the following morning) the Leader of the Party goes to the Queen and asks to be appointed. In theory a shock resignation could trigger a crisis where the Leader of the governing party was not someone who anticipated being PM, but in practice PMs only resign either when forced out (and a new leader is obvious) or on their own terms having named, informally at least, a successor.

Thirdly, he wasn't fired for just ""offending"" jews, his cartoons were heavily anti-semetic and he was openly a racist.

Charlie Hebdo satirized Christianity as much as Judaism as much as Islam.

null,false,hexapodium,null,null,null,"The PM has to command the *confidence* of the House of Commons, but in theory doesn't have to actually be an MP. There have been circumstances historically when Lords have been PM - most recently [Alec Douglas-Home](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Douglas-Home) in the Sixties, when his predecessor as Leader of the Conservatives was taken ill and thought to be at death's door, and announced he would resign as soon as a successor was chosen. 

In the modern era though, convention (gotta love the unwritten constitution based entirely on precedent!) dictates that the PM and the most important Cabinet positions (Chancellor, Home Sec, Justice Sec, Foreign Sec) are held by MPs. However, the way government works is much the same as how the Presidential election is held in November, but then it's a couple of months until the new President takes office. Because we mash our legislature and executive together, we have a scenario where the changes in legislature and executive are decoupled but related, and it goes a bit like this:

1) some weeks before the election, Parliament is dissolved. All MPs are no longer MPs, although the PM and Ministers are still PM and Ministers and are still the executive, even though there is no legislature. 

2) Election day 

3) As results come in and are certified on Election night, MPs are ""returned"" to Parliament. Overnight a picture usually emerges as to what the results are: most constituencies declare by about 3am although some can take days in extreme circumstances.

4a) Historically this would return a majority, and the Queen would first summon the existing Prime Minister to submit their resignation (or to congratulate them on being re-elected) and then summon the leader of the majority party to ask them to form a Government. Note that *this* is when being PM gets handed over. 

4b) What may well happen this year is different: during Coalition negotiations, the Queen will delay summoning the outgoing PM to resign (because it is broadly accepted that you need an Executive in case there's a war or something that requires instant response). The PM, who in theory could have lost his seat and not be returning as an MP, is *still* PM (and their Cabinet are still Ministers) until they all hand in their resignations. Meanwhile, negotiations occur to identify which, if any, leader ""commands the confidence of the House"", i.e. will be able to pass a Queen's Speech (legislative programme). When this is clear, the Queen is informed who that leader is, and she proceeds as in step 4a, but this can happen days later. If no leader can be found, then a new election is called, but the old Prime Minister and Cabinet (the Executive) remain the Government as before. 

For the present situation, it is [quite likely](http://may2015.com/featured/election-2015-polls-suggest-ed-miliband-is-likely-to-become-prime-minister/) that Ed Miliband won't have an outright Labour majority, but that some sort of loose coalition between Labour, the SNP, and possibly Plaid and the Greens, will command a majority in the House. Some left-leaning Lib Dems might even break the whip and join as well, although the Lib Dems as a whole are unlikely to. It will probably be a couple of days before that occurs, during which commentators are expecting a concerted dirty tricks campaign from the Tories to try to sink any negotiations, as the Tories are the only party with the financial resources to fight a second election inside a year and stand to benefit greatly from forcing the issue. However, assuming a successful agreement of some form is established (e.g. confidence and supply and case-by-case support) then the outcome is quite clear: the Queen must ask for Cameron's resignation and summon Miliband (or any other individual who has the support of the House, i.e. if a coalition was formed but for some reason it was contingent on another senior Labour MP being PM instead) to form the next Government.

There is merit to buying young, no disagreement there, but you can't say we've bought sensibly when going this route.

The money wasted on the loaning of Cissokho and Mankini. 20m on Markovic. 20m on a POSSIBLE future star. 20m should be getting you someone who is on the verge of, not seasons of development away from.

Mario for 16m? He had 1 goal in the league in previous near season in it with City. Lambert at 4m, I can see the sense in that, but he hasn't played. Borini, Rodgers buy, not given time, loaned out, brought back, not wanted, put on the bench, not played.

Abortion:
&gt; ""Holocaust 2"" - the cull of baby humans - has been going on for 35 years, not just in Britain, but all of Western Europe. It's not just a massacre of children and an abuse of women and teenage girls. It's also caused us a demographic disaster. Among our citizens, the number of young adults of working-age is now too small to support the ever-growing number of old people. 

Climate change:
&gt;These affected Pacific islanders need to realise they do NOT have the RIGHT to have a fixed coastline. Our coastline is changing too – in Norfolk and the South-West, the sea is encroaching on the land.  At the end of the day, climate change is something we have to MANAGE.  The populations of these low-lying islands like the Maldives, will have to move to other islands.  It has happened before – in the 1960s, the entire population of Tristan de Cunha re-located to Ascension, after a volcano erupted. Global Warming has a plus side which the politicians never mention - like being able to grow  vegetables in the Arctic, and plant crops in Northern Europe and Siberia.

Online voting:
&gt;If online voting comes, you won't get that chance of a last minute change of heart  The App will CAST YOUR VOTE FOR YOU.  The app will just say ""OK  you've decided your ideal party of choice - touch  the green button to cast your vote - easy!  No need to get up off your sofa"".  It will be the App software which in effect, votes on your behalf.

Censorship:
&gt;MAINSTREAM would stop the television companies from continually pixellating (""fuzzing-out"") faces of people in News items. This happens whether  the broadcast is a view taken in the street of passers-by, or CCTV being used to catch criminals, whatever. This is a new scary form of censorship where a privileged few - those who work in the media, and those few people who were actually at the scene - are allowed to see the full picture: But all the rest of us, are prevented from doing so. 

Um, the confusing problem of too many newsreaders:
&gt;The news is always read by TWO people (usually but not always, a man and a woman). First the man tells us something - they look at each other - Is it my turn now? - No, yours - then the woman speaks - they look at each other - my turn now? Or still yours?  Sometimes they both try to speak at the same time - so then they both stop speaking - silence. Like a Punch and Judy show . It's annoying to watch, and insulting to us viewers.

We have quite a bit of money, but none of those elite players want to play for us. Varying reasons, Sanchez being the most recent and prime example. At the same time Rodgers is not a major draw card.

Sturridge WAS a good bit of business, unfortunately I don't think his injuries are going to change, he just seems to be one of those players. Always injured.

Countinho has been outstanding. Up and down for the first 18 months, but this season he's been one of the best in the league. But he is the exception isn't he.

Lovren, rubbish (though I am a big fan) Sakho is a top class defender but Rodgers refused to play him, so 18m say on the bench for the better part of a season (this for me highlights the issue with the way we do transfers and points to the fact he was a committee signing) Lallana, 25m, big fan and was hoping we'd sign him. But 25m for a 26 year old who had 1 good season? Slightly over priced no? Can, good bit of business will be a super star.

I wouldn't even mind a Doctor and Companion lite episode that involves UNIT.

And newer Doctor Who fans may not know this but with some of the earliest Doctors there were in effect Doctor or Companion lite episodes due to the nature of serialization and how the serials were produced. For example the First Doctor serial The Keys of Marinus features two episodes in which the Doctor does not appear. And certain companions would also disappear for episodes for various reasons (getting lost or trapped). And then there was The Deadly Assassin which featured no companion. Unfortunately there weren't always good enough in-story reasons given for their absence.

The way I feel if the story is good enough, I don't mind who is and is not in it. There is no real reason that Doctors and companions need to be joined at the hip on an adventure, but I do understand that the current model of singular episodes doesn't really lend itself to splitting up the Doctor and Companion for very long.

Of course Rhondda is a safe Labour seat.  It's the **definition** of a safe Labour seat. That doesn't mean Plaid is nowhere there. Plaid have held the Assembly seat in the past and will no doubt mount a strong challenge in 2016, as Leanne Wood will be running for the constituency.  

Labour is utterly dominant at Westminster,  and will be this year as well.  Plaid will likely be a distant second,  but second place is still second place. The South-east is not as unfamiliar with Plaid as you think. 

""Distant second"" is probably the best way to describe Plaid across the coalfield.  Realistically,  they don't stand much of a chance of winning any seats in the foreseeable future (Llanelli excepted),  but they remain something of an unofficial opposition to Labour's dominance.  In '99, they won two valleys seats -  Rhondda and Islwyn - and very nearly took others,  such as the Cynon Valley.  

I don't understand your last comment.  If the issue is perceptions, as you seem to be saying, what is it that Plaid must reform? The party has been attempting to address this particular image problem for many years,  and that was most certainly a factor in the election of Leanne Wood as party leader.  Their policies are very much targeted at the archetypal disengaged Labour voter,  and their recent focus on the economy and austerity at the expense of the Welsh language is also,  quite clearly,  a deliberate choice. The party even picked up a bilingual name a few years ago.  Also not accidental. There is only so much you can do when faced with an almost non-existent Welsh media,  but there can be no doubt that the party is doing all it can to appeal to Labour voters in the south-east.

In American Sports the worst teams have the highest picks in the draft which is college players and foreign players entering the league. The Sixers are similar to Spurs but in recent years I'd say they're basically Southampton. They have young talent (Nerlens Noel, Joel Embiid, Dario Saric, Tony Wroten) and many draft picks in the coming years to accrue more young talent. They're basically 2010 Southampton right now, terrible (in League One) but have a promising future and should be in the playoffs in a couple years (in the Premier League). Also they employ analytics better than any team just like Saints.

Basically, if you wanna get in on the ground floor with a team before they're really good and watch the youngsters grow pickup the Sixers.

As a whole for franchise history the Sixers are very similar to Spurs. They were amazing in the early years but in the modern era have basically been a top 6 but no CL equivalent most of the time.

This is incorrect.  A PM who has resigned (or been removed) as party leader does not automatically have to resign as PM.  This is demonstrated by the fact that, when MacDonald was expelled from the Labour Party (the only party of which he was a member at the time) and replaced by Arthur Henderson in that role, MacDonald nonetheless remained as PM.

Regarding Chadli, he basically signed himself. He came out in the media creating links to the club and driving his value down, Levy would have jumped on that from a business perspective. Regarding Eriksen, who in world football didn't know about him? Do you think Baldini or Levy played a larger role in Spurs getting such a good deal on him, I would hint at the latter. 

My largest criticism of him that window was not who he signed, but rather the fact that he didn't sign a left back, a position that had been weak for years.

He also is leaving Dortmund only a few points above relegation. I'll discuss this season since I suppose there is room for it. Both teams were coming into the season having lost star players, lewandoski and Suarez. Rodgers on one hand has been able to arrest what negative momentum we had while Klopp doesn't seem to be able to do that. Why then would someone think he is the right man for the job in a similar scenario to what he is leaving behind, but in a tougher league. And I say similar favorably, Liverpool are in better shape than Dortmund thanks to Rodgers. Klopp may be marginally a better coach right now, he certainly has a better track record, but in the most recent season Rodgers has done better. Where someone would find reason to believe Klopp would be such an upgrade on Rodgers that the risks accompanying that change do not outweigh the benefits leads me to believe that this said person is sensationalist and reactionary and therefore no, let's say purpose this time, to discussion.

One thing you don't seem to understand, as these tragedies in the Mediterannean sea illustrate, the migration problem is increasingly getting worse. And as it gets worse, parties like UKIP, BNP, France's FN, etc, get stronger.

Already mentioned, but I wanted you to see this directly. 

San Antonio is nothing like Tottenham, but they are beautiful in a different way. San Antonio is exactly what Tottenham is trying to be. They are one of the smallest market teams in an unpopular part of the country. What they have done is created an organization that follows a motto of family. The owners are loyal to their staff. They want their guys to succeed and go to other teams to do great things (Mike Budenholzer on the Hawks, Sam Presti in OKC, etc.).

This philosophy trickles down to the head coach who is one of the greatest coaches of all time in any sport. What he was done in San Antonio is amazing. Since San Antonio is so small, they were forced to be unconventional with the players they brought in. They were the first to truly embrace the foreign players and showed in their incredible drafts in the early 2000s. As the years progressed, the team grew older. They had disappointing year by their standards, but something amazing happened. They never blew the team up. The fans and the organization were loyal, and stuck by the aging players while the world thought they were riding off into the sunset. 

Then two years ago, something amazing happened. This same team that has been together since 2003 made a push in the finals and damn near beat one of the greatest teams of individual contributors the NBA has ever seen. The old guys who stuck together were making serious waves. They did this because the coach completely changed the way they competed. They were no longer athletic like they were in the past, so they focused on a pass heavy attack. This has led to some of the most beautiful basketball we have seen since the 80s.

Last year, with the exact same team (minus 1-2 people), they made it back to the finals and won... beating the opponents from the previous year. 

This year, it is expected that the core of players that has been together since 2003 will start retiring. This may be your only chance to witness the end of a great story. 

TLDR; San Antonio is a team that believes in family first. The organization and the fans are a family. The players are never booed and play hard every night. There are no individuals on this team. 

Here are some videos. Notice how other people will link individual players as to why you should watch... in San Antonio, we make videos about the team. I think you understand.

Ballotelli - BR obviously doesn't rate him. He's still a good player, for the sake of his career he should leave as I don't think his gametime will improve much.

Borini - Isnt good enough

Lambert - I still think he could be useful to many teams in the league for a couple more years. I hate seeing him waste the last few years on the bench waiting for cameo appearances but if he's fine with that then I don't mind him staying.

Johnson - Wages

Teixera - Had a great spell at brighton but I don't think he's good enough for Liverpool. Could get a bit of money for him off the back of his good loan spell, even though he only has a year left on his contract. He's already 22 and has had quite a few major injuries already which have probably prevented him from reaching his potential. 

Alberto - not sure about him we are lacking depth in CM so he might be good to keep around

Aspas, Coates, Wisdom, ,   - Will probably never be used, no point keeping them around. 

In: 

I can see us bringing in 3-4 players depending on how many leave. A lot of wages will be freed up with just Stevie and Johnson leaving.  Ideally we bring in a top quality striker, a goalscoring winger, and a CM. Defensively I think we are fine for now if they get adequate, but I do think we need to bring in a new GK. There are some top GKs available this summer so if we can upgrade I'd definitely do so. A top GK can be the difference between getting top 4 or not. Given what's been in the gossip so far, I think Pedro / Konoplyanka , Cech / Handanovic, a CDM / CM, striker would be ideal.

*Did a lot of things right, played envious football, almost won the league.

*Developed players (Hendo, Sterling, Sakho, Migs off late) under him.

*Also repeatedly made the same mistakes, quickly sold himself to the public when things started going right.

*Marginalised players he didn't buy and over promoted those he has. 

*The season has been disappointing, not disastrous by any means.

*Signing Klopp would make a statement. Show the club's ambition. 

*If the owners don't even have this debate and consider Klopp, knowing his (theoritical) availability, that's a disaster.

Loan Out: Teixiera, Wisdom, some other rotation players in our U21 (Ojo, etc...)

Forwards: Bring in Ings and Ayew, and I'm content. Ayew, Ings, Studge, Balotelli, Origi +/- Sterling is definitely enough firepower. I believe our lineup will find goalscoring form with a stronger midfield and players developing more experience. I don't think bringing in a 40m+ striker will instantly fix our goal issues, though I'd certainly welcome the striker with open arms haha. If Sterling leaves and/or we don't get Ings, then bring in Vietto.

Midfield: Hendo is a lock, and that leaves us bringing in competition who will rotate with Can/Allen, and someone to rotate with Lucas. My semi-realistic picks are Matias Kranvitter (DM from River Plate) and Sissoko (Newcastle), Wijnaldum (PSV), or Firmino (Hoffenheim).

Defense: Wouldn't do anything to our CBs, we have enough depth with Skrtel, Sakho, Illori, Can (if needed), Lovren, and Kolo (if he stays). I'd keep Enrique for competition with Moreno, he doesn't complain and he does the job well enough for a backup player. Right back is a tough one, but I like Jamaat (Newcastle), or Micah Richards (unpopular, but will be cheap and EPL proven). Unknown what will happen to Flanno.

GK: Lots of available keepers who could compete with Mignolet, but not too many that are clearly better than him. I'd bring in Sergio Romero (soon to be free agent), or Neto (soon to be free). Otherwise, we invest big and try and bring in Cech.

Right now almost all of our attacks are orchastrated through hazard. Pogba would be another person to bring the ball up, pressure and press, **score goals**, interchange with our forwards. Stuff that Fabregas doesn't do. Cesc is doing a significant portion of defensive work, his assists were mainly pings straight onto costa. He doesn't score goals. 

Earlier in the season as you mentioned, Matic was far more dominant in midfield which gave cesc a bit more freedom and space to be more involved in the attack, however as we've seen, its not possible for matic to keep up that ridiculous form he had all throughout the season. Now that he's far less dominant, cesc has a much higher share of defensive duties, which we wouldn't want to give to Pogba. His talents in goalscoring and penetrating defences would simply be **wasted** playing deep. 

If he were to ever come to chelsea which I highly doubt, he would replace Oscar, Not fabregas. Why on earth would we replace Fabregas with Pogba if Fabregas has been brilliant in that position? Its what has worked the best. Why would we change it?

Of course in the 18th-19th centuries, although MPs were elected, the world was very different. Only reasonably well-off men could vote, so the various parties were generally fairly informal groups of rich men whose political opinion merely divided them by ways in which they could make themselves even richer. For example the Whigs generally supported traditional aristocracy and their ways of making money from tenanted farmers on their land etc, and the Tories were more the party of the up-and-coming capitalist factory owners. But because MPs weren't voted for by either tenanted farmers or factory workers, they rarely concerned themselves with issues that might affect ""the common person"".

If you go back further in time then -- although Parliament met whenever the King wanted a bit more cash (usually so that he could go off and start poking Frenchmen with swords) -- there were no elected MPs and indeed no House of Commons. Parliament was effectively a club of all the wealthy and important people in the country (which is why we still have bishops in Parliament, as 600-700 years ago they most definitely counted as among the ""wealthy and important"") so formal political parties didn't really exist.

Holyrood can function with minority governments since most of (if not all) the essential functions of the Scottish state can take part without it. If Scottish politicians agree/compromise and legislate = great! If they don't, no biggy.

Westminster however has no higher chamber to fill the gaps when it can't legislate. Heres an example, I work for a well known state healthcare provider. My pay is agreed nationally for the next 18 months. After that there will need to be new legislation to effectively establish a remit to pay me. No government majority = no budget = no functions of government including my pay.

Holyrood isn't a real government, it's a toy parliament. I'm not saying that to demean it, but to point out it doesn't really serve to run the state... It's more of a debating chamber to decide how a small amount of money gets spent regionally and how a limited range of social powers are exercised. The hope on both sides of the border is that the smith commissions devolution plan will make Holyrood into a more serious form of government with actual responsibility.

So I wouldn't take the SNPs experience of holyrood as a model for the state. It's works because it can't really fail. Westminsters a bit more serious and the scope for damage is much larger.

That's wrong though. 

Klopp did exactly what Rodgers is trying to do here, raise a group of young potential talents to become champions. Klopp took over with a large group of young players who for the most part have remained to this day, but when he started, they were 19-22 y/o (Hummels, Subotic, Lewandowski, Kagawa, Sahin, Grosskreutz, Bender, etc.) 

This is why he's so ideal for us. He's done what Rodgers is trying to do. He is great at nurturing young talent. As for world class, okay maybe not world class, but he is a great manager, that's undeniable. Dortmund were 13th before he took over. And yeah he's had a bad season but even despite that, he's still managed to lead Dortmund to 1st in their group in CL which is not easy.

Having looked at both, it seems the Wikipedia table has the latest updates and is also more accurate. The main discrepancy I saw was in Swansea's points. Soccerway had them on 44, Wikipedia on 46. This is quite a significant difference when you consider they're right behind us!

Upon further investigation, it appears as though soccerway.com has the Swansea U21 v Crewe U21 in October game as a [1-1 draw](http://uk.soccerway.com/matches/2014/10/13/england/central-league/swansea-city-u21/crewe-alexandra-u21/1926391/). Wikipedia has the result as 2-1 to Swansea.

I checked the [Swansea](http://www.swanseacity.net/news/article/u21s-fixtures-14-15-1805426.aspx) and [Crewe](http://www.crewealex.net/fixtures-results/u21-development-squad/) results lists and both confirm the game finished 2-1 to Swansea.

So I think you're good to go with Wikiped as the most accurate table. However, I've just discovered futbol24.com also has accurate results and a [table](http://www.futbol24.com/team/England/Crystal-Palace-U21/) that combines both the North and South Divisions.

There's a fly in the ointment, though, in the form of Scotland. Following the recent rise of the nationalist party following the independence referendum, Labour look set to lose as many as 40 seats or more from north of the boarder. This means that despite the fact that we're polling better than the Tories in England and Wales, we might still come out with less seats now. It's not a total problem, as the SNP have categorically stated that they will not prop up the Tories and will only deal with Labour, so we should still be able to pull together a government after the dust has settled. The Tories are using ""vote Labour, get SNP"" scare tactics in England and Wales to the full extent now, though.

Still, it's still looking good.

The US legal system is far more politicised than the UKs system and having them linked together by the ""few-to-no questions asked"" extradition policy leaves people going about their lawful business in the UK open to the same unjust tactics they exploit there (long delays before trial without appropriate bail, charge ""stacking"", abuse of process, inadequate defense resources, politically motivated prosecutions etc).  Admire what you will about the great USofA, their legal system is not one we should emulate.

Anyone who knows about the flash crash should understand it was not caused by any one market actor alone and that it was a matter of companies being expensively incompetent not criminal (either by negligence or intent).  It's also worth noting that no one profited from it.

As for layering, it is a market abuse but it is one usually dealt with with fines and it is just one of hundreds of questionable activities high frequency trading firms use.  Since there are literally 1000s of such US based firms, it seems questionable to me to start by prosecuting only people on this side of the Atlantic...

If any of those both Filipe Luis, they'd give him much more playing time.

You might argue we don't have the leisure of doing this, but I argue that this is what need to do in order to next the step to reach the level of Real, Bayern or Barcelona. We need to take a risk and be proactive. Say we go down 1 or 2 goals in an important fixture. Who's there to turn to? Right now with the way that we rarely rotate, we have nobody to rely on. All of our benched outfield players this season have been mediocre barring Remy. 

This season, I'm actually pretty happy overall with the strategy despite what I'm arguing since it's been a couple years since Mourinho or Chelsea won the title, so it would ease pressure on management allowing us to take risks with youth/bench players in the future. However, I don't think this should be attitude for the future. We'll almost always be in a title race and competing for 2 to 4 trophies each season. For the past few years, we've had a crazy amount of success with our youth academy. If we have to really on loans to develop our youth players, I don't think we'll ever reach the upper echelon of super clubs like Real, Barca and Bayern.

FYI companies rarely give a negative reference due to slander issues. They'll likely just say something like ""X was employed here from Y to Z with the job title A"". Sometimes someone will try to skirt this by asking "" Is the employee eligible for rehire"" but the answer will only be ""no"" if you were fired.

Do you have an idea as to what area you'd like to contribute to? Knowing that could narrow down what the opportunities are like, as people could discuss the researchers here. 

I did URP. It's really what you make of it; you get 10 credits worth of time to go off and do what you want. 

Make sure the transfer is what you want; from a cultural perspective, you're going to notice a bunch of differences. The university is a lot more hands-off. For instance, many of the classes I had this semester didn't have home-work or tutorials. We only had to do 2 pieces of coursework. It gives you the opportunity to do things in your spare time (research!!!) and read around the course, but not everyone likes that setup.  

Your course is mostly loaded onto your exams which are all in May. Coursework accounts for somewhere between 10-25% of your total mark. The rest is from exams. Besides this, the feedback here is poor. You don't really get any problem sets to work off of, so it's sometimes challenging to discern how well you *actually* know the material.

You're degree is a lot more focused here, but that's a double-edged sword. As you get into higher years---especially with AI &amp; CS---you can't take many outside courses. It limits your ability to see interdisciplinary applications of CS in some ways. Despite what people say, I still think that taking some English composition courses would be helpful for everyone.

That being said, it's a good course, especially if you're interested in Machine Learning. The stuff we do at an undergraduate level typically isn't taught back home until you get to your master's.

**Edit:** you can always do research at home if you choose to go back over the summer; that's what I do, and I think that's the best option.

To me it does seem the Liverpool is hedging itself in the same way that Arsenal did in the bare years - unfortunately without the results to show from it, on the field and on the transfer balance sheet. I think Liverpool did phenomenally to get Coutinho and Sturridge at those prices; like Arsenal however it might reach the stage that perhaps selling Coutinho to continue this cycle of buy-low sell high would be the way forward. I don't see Sturridge leaving because foreign acquisitions of English premium players are rare, and he's already jumped from a big club before. I think only Chelsea would move in for him, perhaps if only to strengthen their locally-developed player base. Other things in favour of the Arsene method of rebuilding a squad was that he seems to have high regard for value - he never moved for players that had big seasons unless there was other price-mitigating factors (Koscielny having his big season in the French L2, or Giroud being part of a cash-strapped outfit). Unfortunately BR had paid well over the odds for the likes of Lallana and Lovren because of how they had contributed to Southampton's success last season. It was more in Arsene's MO to move for the said players this season, after a season with an obvious dip in form, or having moved to a financially-or-championship-underperforming-team (Cazorla with Malaga).

&gt;
&gt;A War Machine captured in a magnetic field. (TV: *The War Machines*)
&gt;The War Machines were robots designed by the super-computer WOTAN and built by its human slaves in its plot to conquer Earth. WOTAN processed the thoughts that machines should become the dominant force on Earth and removal of humans was necessary. Only two War Machines were activated.
&gt;The first War Machine attacked a group of soldiers and despite heavy fire, was undamaged. Before it could kill the remaining soldiers and the First Doctor, it shut down because it was unfinished. The second War Machine was captured by the Doctor and reprogrammed to destroy WOTAN. (TV: *The War Machines*)

No I don't think any other big club would do any different if Luis plays for them the same way as he has for us this season.  I don't understand why you would want a player not doing well to get more game time.

I think your priority is all wrong.  I don't know why you are so hung up on giving Luis more playing time.  The only thing I care about is the team winning and not the individual.  That is mourihno mantra.  Team comes first.  It is not about giving every player a turn.  It is not about making every player happy in our squad.  It is about becoming champions and winners.

We are already at the level of real, barca and Bayern.  I dont think there are many people who think we are a level below.  Real and Barca has it good because they take the majority of thr TV money in Spain so why it would be hard to get to their level finacial side.  I certainly don't see Bayern as a bigger club then us. Also, right now our squad is on the younger side but give it a few years and they'll all be in their prime.

The fact is because we are a big club why it is not as much of a priority for us with youths and we can go out and buy the best.  Our academy is not just there to provide players for our squad as it is so hard to get in but to generate cash.  Even if they cant get into our squad, we are making money selling these players and if we are lucky enough to get a first teamer all the better.  People seem to think it is so easy to bring a youth player through.  There are only 11 places in the team.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"A lot of the verdicts are relatively logical but I'm a bit confused about the ""Go"" verdict for Sakho and Lovren.

I know, I know, ""It's the Mirror,"" right? I get it, websites need clicks, blah blah blah. But I still wanted to respond...

* I have a hard time believing that a 25-year-old Sakho -- who played for a big club and even captained the club as well -- suddenly turned into shit.
* I also have a hard time believing that 25-year-old Lovren -- an allegedly stalwart of the Southampton defence last season -- also suddenly turned into shit.

Talent -- or lack thereof, depending on whose side you're on! -- aside, I think there are a lot of reasons why Sakho and Lovren won't be sold, and, frankly, I think we'll actually need those two more than ever:

1. We don't have a lot of defenders especially since we're expecting Glen Johnson, Enrique and K. Toure in different shirts next season.
2. Martin Skrtel at 30-years-old stands as our only veteran leader in our defence.
3. The young Moreno is still evolving.
4. The promising Jon Flanagan is now a bit of a question mark following his injury-plagued season.
5. Coates (remember him?) has barely featured at Sunderland. (Though, it's surprising that he is only 24-years-old).
6. Andre Wisdom has seemed to do well on loan but has not yet been regularly involved with Rodgers and the Liverpool defence.

So, we'll certainly need the likes of Sakho and Lovren next season.

But say the argument still stands: They're not good enough.

I think the unfortunate counter-argument is, if not them, then who?

I think LFC already struggles to secure new players (esp. so-called ""marquee"" names), I think Rodgers certainly leans towards the philosophy that a *the best defence is a great offence*, so I don't think defence is high on the list of priorities this summer.

Furthermore, even if only for political/leverage reasons, Rodgers will certainly not be selling Lovren after just one season (i.e. that would be an admission of failure and we know that for better or worse, Rodgers is reluctant to give up so quickly).

Finally, I think we're forgetting about the intangibles that make the performance of Sakho and Lovren seem ""poor.""

* Lovren has only played in the Premier League for one season and has made his first big move to a big club under circumstances that were not the best. I would imagine there's a lot of pressure Lovren puts on himself, coupled with the fact that this is his third club in three seasons.
* Sakho left the only club he has ever known and jumped into the intense Premier League with a team with a great deal of history, pressure, expectation, etc.

Sure, one can say, hey, Coutinho seems to be doing just fine. But I'll bet the steady hand of Lucas and even the support of Luis Suarez helped Coutinho adjust and become comfortable very quickly.

At this point, I'd rather go with the devil we know (Sakho, Lovren) rather than the devil we don't (New Transfer XYZ).

I certainly expected us to struggle this season (though, not *this* much) and I have often referred to this current season as a transitional season, therefore, I have bit my tongue with all the ""sell him! buy him! sack him! hire him!"" sort of stuff.

In a sense, finishing in second place was quite possibly the worst that happened to us because it raised the level of hope and expectation for this season far beyond what it should have been. And to say otherwise leading into this season would be shouted down.

Hell, even if we won the title, I still think we would have faced the same regression. But, of course, we'd at least be able to hang our hats on the title.

&gt;Liverpool's last six games are crucial. Champions League qualification may not be achieved, but a rediscovering of both identity and intestinal fortitude has to be. 

As I said before, I always believed this season would be a transitional season. That belief became stronger once Suarez left, even stronger with our numerous signings, and pretty much set in stone once Sturridge embarked on his injury-filled campaign.

Champions League? Not impossible but a lot has to go right and that starts with Liverpool having to pretty much *win* all of our remaining matches.

So, now what?

- consult your family doctor. If your reactions are this severe/ common testing to identify the allergen(s) would be helpful. Also confirm that your 'spots'/ clogging are indeed acne vulgaris and not rosacea or a different presentation of contact dermatitis

- everything you mention is drugstore 'beauty' and many of those are loaded with common irritants and allergens. A switched on and up-to-date pharmacist should be able to help you with products with very few ingredients (not aqueous cream = SLS)

- forget anti ageing and natural, they will be loaded with common irritants/ allergens. Ideally look for a physical not chemical sunscreen, this may well mean ordering online

- review your diet and lifestyle choices, do not underestimate the effect on skin barrier strength, reducing inflammation, calming inappropriate immune responses

My skin is classed as hypersensitive (rosacea, history of eczema and contact dermatitis). but in many ways my skin is more manageable than it has ever been by not just considering the product that *appeared* to be the culprit but not over cleansing, not over exfoliating, diet and lifestyle modification.

EDIT:

&gt; Hi,
&gt;  
&gt; Unfortunately all of our toners and gels that contain a small percentage of Mandelic also contain Niacinamide. The best I could advise it the lowest concentration Mandelic peel. Peels can be something people naturally fear but our home peels are not at all like the salon peels. There is no visible peeling of the skin layers. The most you will have is approximately 30 minutes of slight redness and a very minor stinging sensation on the first few applications, nothing that is not bearable. Some of our customers don’t even experience this when using the lowest strength peels. If it is something you would like to go ahead with then do get back to me with any questions or worries you may have and I can take you through the process step by step and explain everything to you in detail before you purchase.

I come from and work on the Wirral, so have a slight accent but nothing I can't hide if I want to.

My boss/company owner is from the Wirral himself and based his office on the Wirral. A colleague of mine is also from the Wirral but further up, and has a more prominent scouse accent. I personally love it!

Anyway, a while ago, (and my colleague is not always his favourite person anyway, for reasons unknown) my boss told her off for speaking on the phone with a scouse accent. Told her un no uncertain terms that he didn't want her on the phone to our clients with that kind of accent, and that it sounds dumb and stupid, and that she has also got to stop with all the ""eeerm"". Basically he wants her to change her accent and it was put across in a really unfriendly way - him being the boss of the company, it was almost a disciplinary (not that he'd have a leg to stand on should he sack her for that reason) and made my colleague quite upset.

He believes that such groups will do a better job of preserving human rights and the environment although he doesn't really explain why that is the case. At least I think that's the case. It's hard to work out if he wants local communities to have more power, if he wants institutions to have more power, or he wants power devolved to the collections who then join up and form a centralised government.

His ideology is bizarre. It's the mutant child of socialism and libertarianism. I am pretty sure he just spouts clichés without thinking of any cohesive, clear, thought behind it.

It will probably be most cost effective to replace *both* lenses with a standard CR39 lens with a similar green tint. They'd look right (and not shatter again) but they'd feel different due to being lighter weight.

null,false,orwellsocietyguy,null,null,null,"&gt; but I don't personally agree with placebos on a moral level

Well that's your opinion and it comes from a very weak place. Passing judgement on thousands and thousands of family doctors and GP's and calling them 'asshats' only reveals your arrogance. Who are you to tell them how to behave? What experience do you have other than a surface level experience of being a patient and an internet browser? I bet you wouldn't call a room full over overworked GP's an 'asshat' to their face.


&gt; and I don't think any treatment of unproven efficacy should be funded by the NHS, nor should placebos.

A GP giving a placebo is not 'funded by the NHS'. Doctors aren't handing them out and then asking for more money. If a patient is not actually ill then a placebo is given to remove them for the system as a cost saving method. Aspirin is not only a cost of less than a fraction of a penny to the NHS, it's entirely harmless and has been proven to show multiple positive effects that are not related to the illness at hand. Multivitamins and anti-depressants are also mostly placebo driven and regularly given out. Germany and the US practice placebo FAR more than we do. But if it saves money and gets a patient who is clearly not ill out of a hospital bed then you'll be damn sure I'm behind that decision.


&gt; Homeopathy is nonsense, it is fraud.

If you'd bothered to read what I put I agreed with that point. You simply read the word and ran off on your own rant. The NHS and the BMI both agree on this as do 99% of doctors.


&gt; yet you don't know what a prescription is or means.

Yet again you missed my point. A placebo is 'any substance or procedure' that a patience 'accepts as medicine or therapy'. The signing of the prescription is ONE example of a placebo. Antidepressants, hypnotherapy and placebo surgery are prescribed and not available 'over the counter' and yet a vast majority of them are close to nothing in pill form.


&gt; Or perhaps you and I have got this backwards.

No you're just naive as to how the system works. 97% of HNS Family Doctors have admitted to prescribing placebo's. This is not some 'quack science' it's the real world. And whether you like it or not, or it makes your moral compass spin about in a tizzy, it's how actual on the ground doctors behave.

http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/03March/Pages/97-percent-of-GPs-admit-prescribing-placebos.aspx

Placebo surgical procedure is also not uncommon:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2558438/The-remarkable-power-PLACEBO-effect-Patients-FAKE-surgery-broken-recovered-just-documentary-reveals.html

Studies by the University of Hull have shown many antidepressants are literally no better than placebos:

I am not defending this or passing moral judgement. It's idiotic to do so with out really knowing the all the arguments. I reserve judgment and yet my family has over 100+ years combined medical experience and knowledge of the internal working of the NHS.

Late edit: And because this discussion is about managers, let's add this: How could we expect to land a Klopp or a DeBoer or, yes, a Rafa, when we're ready to chuck out the architect of the fabled ""project"" after three seasons, the first of which saw us end no worse than the one before, then a second-place finish, and then a potential top four/five finish, which is still better than what we had before he came in. Who wants to manage a club that throws the baby out with the bathwater the second a rough patch is hit? I want to be like Madrid in terms of financial and trophy success, not in how they treat their team as condoms: Get a good ride out of them, then throw them out.

&gt;you're just naive as to how the system works.  97% of HNS Family Doctors have admitted to prescribing placebo's. This is not some 'quack science' it's the real world. And whether you like it or not, or it makes your moral compass spin about in a tizzy, it's how actual on the ground doctors behave.

Just because lots of people do a thing doesn't make it right. That's an appeal to popularity. I'm not naive, I just don't agree with you, there's a difference, learn to accept other people's opinions, perhaps form a few of your own along the way instead of blindly evangelizing that just because lots of other people do something, it must therefore be right. 

It's not a grey area, it's an area in which people chose the ends over the means. You and them refuse to own that, and refuse to accept that some people are allowed to not like that.

Apologies, I missed that, skipped straight reading the article.

&gt;As /u/shaunatron[1]  (a Celtic fan I believe) has said up above - that's football.

So? It doesn't have to be. We can just jog along as things are right now or try and make improvements.

&gt; What do you propose we put in place?

1) Accountability for referees. They're essentially untouchable at the moment.

2) Goal line tech.

3) A hawk-eye system similar to tennis or rugby where the ref can get a second viewing of important decisions.

&gt;Why do other sides not appear to be campaigning as frequently and stringently as Celtic with regard to this?

Celtic have the biggest supporter base of any Scottish team, they play more games and are more often in bigger games where bigger decisions are made.

EDIT: Prove to me that Celtic complain more often than the other sides.

A lot of places need technicians of varying types, from airports to entertainment venues to schools- the jobs won't be identical, but there may be types of technician you hadn't considered. In terms of getting the job, it's a question of re-framing the situation, and turning what may look like negatives into positives.

For example, from a safety perspective, being a little older is often seen as a benefit, as you're more mature and responsible, rather than being some teenage kid who thinks they know it all and does careless/dangerous/stupid things. Degrees and diplomas can't trump common sense and being methodical.

Technician work will also often be specific to that place and venue, and as he hasn't done it elsewhere, he is essentially going in as a blank page, ready to learn how things are done properly in that location, without already having bad habits from having worked elsewhere.

Finally, if there are diploma requirements, a company may be willing to assist in acquiring those, if he doesn't have them. It's a question of downplaying the academic side and upselling himself as an individual ready to be dedicated to developing a career in that field.

I also take your point about my use of the word ""choice,"" and for taking issue with my remark ""something they weren't born to be."" Again, I didn't mean any offence. I appreciate that the people we all identify as can sometimes be at odds with our outward appearance. I certainly didn't mean that

You may ignore traffic signals and signage if instructed to do so by a Police Officer.

This might be in the event of an accident, signal failure, or special events (e.g. a normally quiet side road is spewing out traffic from a country show or some event, and the priorities on the road signage are inappropriate for that one day of the year, so they are managing the junction manually). You would hope in such a circumstance they would have disabled any red-light cameras or simply disregarded all footage for that day on the basis they know they will have a lot of false-positives where the lights say red but cars are moving under direction of an officer.

The same applies with major incidents on motorways where they are going to be there a while and (having closed the road at the previous junction and diverted new traffic), start turning the queued traffic around and send them back up the motorway/dual carriageway in the wrong direction back to the previous junction.

Signalling from an officer is the only reason you may disregard signage.

What's very dubious is whether a Police Car with blue lights and a driver making ""get out of the way"" motions with their hands constitutes ""Instructions from a Constable"". Technically an officer is telling you to move, so there's definite grounds for appeal, but it's a bit of a double standard given that they're behind you and in the same position to judge whether it's safe for you to comply as an Ambulance or Fire engine driver would be! In fact they're probably in a *worse* position to make that judgement since they'll probably be in a car and unable to see past you, unlike an Ambulance or Fire engine where the driver has an elevated driving position and can see over you!",null,0,null,1429701748,null,0,1429702607,0,cqkp14t,null,t3_33fyuy,null,t1_cqkp14t,null,t1_cqko08k,null,null,null,1432534849,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

I'll (carefully!) jump reds for ambulances and fire engines but I won't for Police. Courts always rule against the driver in that circumstance and it's not worth £100 and 3 points on my (very clean) licence. On my bike (motor and human powered) I'll shuffle over and lean away from the vehicle if it gives a gap for the Police to get through but if not then I won't. Ambulances and fire crews don't wield the same power as the Police do and aren't likely to report you for it - the Police will (and do).

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; It's an absolute offence, there is no lawful defence or exception for jumping a red light.

Actually, there is one defence, and only one.

You may ignore traffic signals and signage if instructed to do by a Police Officer.

This might be in the event of an accident, signal failure, or special events (a normally quiet side road is spewing out traffic from a country show or some event, and the priorities on the road signage are inappropriate for that one day of the year, so they are managing the junction manually). You would hope in such a circumstance they would have disabled any red-light cameras or simply disregarded all footage for that day on the basis they know they will have a lot of false-positives where the lights say Red but cars are moving under direction of an officer.

The same applies with major incidents on motorways where they are going to be there a while and (having closed the road at the previous junction and diverted new traffic), start turning the queued traffic around and send them back up the motorway/dual carriageway in the wrong direction back to the previous junction.

Signalling from an officer is the only reason you may disregard signage.

What's very dubious is whether a Police Car with blue lights and a driver making ""get out of the way"" motions with their hands constitutes ""Instructions from a Constable"". Technically an officer is telling you to move, so there's definite grounds for appeal, but it's a bit of a double standard given that they're behind you and in the same position to judge whether it's safe for you to comply as an Ambulance or Fire engine driver would be!

As /u/Cronus4444 says, necessity might also do it. There was a car accident on the junction, it was necessary for you to nose your car out the way to clear space for the emergency services to do their job. That's entirely discretionary however, and depends whether the magistrate considers your actions to have in fact been necessary.",null,0,null,1429702339,null,0,false,0,cqkp6vr,null,t3_33fyuy,null,t1_cqkp6vr,null,t1_cqkogr2,null,null,null,1432534993,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Lampard is actually earning more than JT now I think at City.

And Hazard is on 185k ish. Not quite 200k.

Costa is on 150k I believe, although that was according to the Daily Mail so I doubt it a bit.

Edit; Terry was on about 180k at some point, pretty certain he isn't now. Can't find any sources, a lot of fairly dubious news articles about contracts seem to hover at that mark although nothing recently.

Also looking at /u/ccrraapp's numbers, it looks like the old Mata figure before the new contract signed a fairly short time before his move which was 100k.

Other things worth adding. Moses is still costing us a bit probably as his reported wages at signing was in the region of 40-50k. Not all of that will be payed by most loan clubs you have to assume.

However, there's more to the Establishment than politics. Clearly, much of the rest of even the *political* Establishment is losing it's shit over Labour and the SNP, even though both those parties are, themselves, part of the Establishment (the SNP having been in power for nearly a decade in Scotland). From that limited point of view, a big chunk of the Establishment is against Labour, even if that's just the Establishment eating itself (also a good thing?).

There's also the question of the media establishment, the business establishment, the academic establishment (to some extent)... Some or all of those are definitely primarily anti-Labour and/or anti-SNP, siding with the parts of the political establishment that are already anti-Lab/SNP, and creating a fairly strong impression that those Establishment parties are, in fact, anti-Establishment.

He's not even pretending to be balanced that is literally a written advertisement for labour and a very personal and very unfair attack on the Tories. That's as bad as anything the Sun or Mail do. He should be ashamed of that article. 

Just because something is written to appeal to a different demographic doesn't mean the smear isn't any less real. I in fact think the guardian is worse because they'd have people like you believe they are balanced.

We don't want a Theo Walcott on 100k that ruins our bargaining rights ahaha

Also I'd be more inclined to believe Costa was actually on high wages than Fabregas given Costa was/is a Mendes/Gestifute client and their rather massively influential ""partnership"" with our club.

Also didn't Fabregas initially take a slight pay cut to join Barca? Anyway that was a long time ago.

I don't particularly trust any of the figures reported in most places, certainly not with speculation. And very few clubs release individual breakdowns which makes it even harder to discern wages from bonuses and clauses.

For example Terry might have a new contract next season for 60k a week with an added 50-60k match fee. So a pay-as-you-play clause if you will.

72,400 in England
69,000 in Scotland,

The population of England is 29.94 times larger than that of NI Interestingly, England has 29.61 times (533 compared to 18) the number of MP seats (based on the numbers above). So, proportionally it makes sense that we only have that number of seats. According to more of the ONS data, we have 1 MP for every 66,800 electorates, compared to England's 1 per 72,400. So per person we are actually better off with smaller populous in our constituencies.

Or you could just keep doing it and wait for it to become unremarkable. There's nothing intrinsically different from wearing pink latex to wearing brown cotton. 

&gt;No it isn't.

Yeah. Tiz. Totally.

You make it sound like she chose to commit suicide because she was wearing a different colored wig. She killed herself because people hadn't got the decency to treat her ""normally"" (something which according to you still remains undefined anyway). Why should she have to change anything?

The answer to your question if the choice was as straight forward as: Wear a brightly colored wig and commit suicide or don't and live then obviously it would be daft to go for the first option. But there is so much more to this and to simplify it like that is, quite frankly, nonsense.

I'm saying that mental illness is there because of the way the person was treated. To say ""well in 90% of cases they kill themselves because they are mentally ill"", you are right, it is never the ""calculated protest of a sane mind"".

Wouldn't recommend putting any significant amount of 'extra' into any account above their cap; that just leaves money sat at 0%. But you can always operate more than one account - essentially aiming to put each additional bit of savings-funds you find into the account with the next best rate, and set up standing orders shuffling money around in a circle to meet the ""Deposit £X per month"" requirement on each one.

There's a few devils in the details with the 1-2-3 account, as to exactly when you come out ahead by opening one; given the £2/month fee, the cashback paid, and the sliding scale of interest rates - makes it a bit more complicated.

But it somehow escaped me, in all my reading, that that person didn't necessarily have to be an elected MP as a prerequisite. I'll have to go back and do some more reading.

&gt;the way government works is much the same as how the Presidential election is held in November, but then it's a couple of months until the new President takes office

For what it's worth (just swapping info, here), that delay in the U.S. system is a relic, as it was in the UK, of the travel delays of the 18th century. It took a while for the ballots to be forwarded to Washington from the state legislatures, and then another while for word of the results to get back to the states, and then the winners had to get on their horses and make their way to Washington. And as new states were added to the west, it took even longer.

The new Congress (and new President, if it was one of those elections) originally were sworn in in March -- and four months delay was often barely enough. When travel improved, the swearing-in was moved up to January, because that was now practical.

The gist of the tax avoidance method is this:

Income - expenses = profit

Profits are subject to 20% corporate tax.

If you make £1000K and have £500K expenses you pay 20% tax on 500K or 100K.

Now if you increase those expenses of 500K to 1000K you suddenly have £0 profits. £0 profits means 0 tax or losses which you can carry forward and ofset against next years profits.

You can increase those expenses by 'selling' your store to a foreign company (which is completely separate /sarc and has absolutely NO relationship to your company /sarc). Using this company to artificially increase expenses. For example wouldn't it be terribly convenient if that overseas company happened to charge 500K in rent? 

The overseas territory has a lower tax rate than the UK 20% rate so you save the difference.

null,false,Kitchner,null,null,null,"Is the question:

""How can my husband get a better job?""

or is it

""How can my husband get a job in engineering/as a technician?""

If the question is the latter I don't know much about engineering jobs but I do know that as a general rule if someone with your husband's CV will face an uphill struggle. It will look like he's struggled with the actual subject matter as you'd hope anyone wanting to be an engineer would complete the course in one go.

He's also going to struggle because of his age. I know employers aren't supposed to be ageist, but realistically they are. I'm 26, I finished university in 2010. Even if your husband had finished university in 2014, he would still be 7 years older than me and equally qualified. He maybe would have some more experience (the go karting stuff you mentioned) but assuming the other candidates have similar experience (or even some experience) he'd really have to stand out.

If you don't have a ""traditional"" entry into an industry I feel you need a strong narrative, people like a good story and an interview is where you tell it. I'm an internal auditor, most internal auditors are accountants. Most accountants left university, joined an accountancy practice, trained to be an accountant, qualified by the age of say 25.

I'm 26 and I'm not qualified but I do have 3 years experience. So when I recently applied for a job with an accountancy practice what they want to know is ""So, how did you get to this point?"" and the answer they don't want is ""Because I didn't know what I wanted to do"" or ""I found the course to tough"" or ""Listen to this sad story about my personal life"". They want to hear an interesting tale about how you accidentally stumbled into the work, or how you've always had a passion for it which is why you did X, Y and Z and now you've decided to try and work in your dream job etc.

If your husband wants to go into engineering he needs a good story. The way you've written this just sounds like he kept quitting. Instead it needs to be a story about how he's tried to make his dream of working as an engineer come true, he tried various different ways until he arrived at this one.

If your question is ""What is an easy way to get out of retail?"" then I'd suggest that he goes to a local college/6th form, study for some AAT (accounting technician) qualifications that cost a couple of hundred quid, and get a job doing bookkeeping for a company. It's dull, repetitive, and with little prospects unless you're studying to be an accountant, but it's not retail and it's relatively cheap and easy to do.

If your husband decides he likes finance, there are plenty of ways to get a job where the company will pay for or towards your studies (working at a university is a good one for example) where he can progress further. If he doesn't like finance well at least it's not retail right?",null,0,null,1429706656,null,0,false,0,cqkqm0t,null,t3_33gb3g,null,t1_cqkqm0t,null,t3_33gb3g,null,null,null,1432535663,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

3. Not sure what you mean. If it has recently passed an MOT, that means that nothing critical is imminently falling off. It doesn't necessarily mean it's in great shape, though. Without a more concrete set of facts about the car, it's hard to be more specific.

Check your Nationwide balance every so often and move any excess across to TSB - it's the same rate in either account, you just want to avoid having more then £2500 in Nationwide.

* About 8 months later, the TSB account will be getting full at £2000. Open a Santander account, and set up either a fresh pair of standing orders to/from for £500, or set up a loop - £500 from Nationwide to TSB, from TSB to Santander, and from Santander back to Nationwide. Ideally you'd also include the monthly interest from TSB in the amount flowing into Santander. Either way, continue checking both Nationwide and TSB every so often, and moving any excess into Santander.

* For simplicity I'm going to assume that paying all your bills out of Santander by direct debit produces enough cashback to cover the £2/month fee. Which is pretty likely - 1% on council tax/water bills of ~£100 and 2% on electric/gas bills of ~£50 would make £2 month, and that's before you add the 3% on phone/broadband bills. Probably best to move £500 across right away as to ensure there's always enough in there to pay these bills.

* After another 2 months you'll have about £500 in Santander. But now that we're at 1 year since the start-date, the rate paid by Nationwide will be about to drop down to 1% - don't stand for that; close the Nationwide account and transfer the balance to Santander, bringing it up to £3000 to start earning 3%. 

* At this point I'd start using Santander as your 'main' account - have your income paid into it, pay your bills from it, and send £500/month on a short round trip through TSB. Your balance may initially fluctuate a bit back and forward over the £3k threshold but that'll settle out soon enough if you keep saving.

***

Alternatively if you'd rather not bother with TSB... £2000 into Nationwide immediately, and when it maxes out, move any excess into Santander. When you get up to a balance of £2000 in Santander, it's worth transferring in the final £1000 as soon as you can to boost the rate up. By the end of the year you'll have a combined balance of £5000 (ideally £3k in Santander, £2k in Nationwide), and then when the Nationwide rate drops you can go full-Santander into the sunset.",null,0,null,1429708483,null,0,1429709034,0,cqkrdd9,null,t3_32pibs,null,t1_cqkrdd9,null,t1_cqkpist,null,null,null,1432536022,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

The (2004, I mention) article linked doesn't expand on this or go into detail in comparing suicide rates post-op and pre-op, so I cannot comment on that specifically, but there absolutely is beneficial effect of physical transition and it would be a damned crying shame if anyone glanced by this comment and walked away with ""dang, maybe we shouldn't be giving them transsexuals *what they medically need the most*"". Them implying that it just plain don't work may have been a sound conclusion a decade ago, but more recent and thorough sources beg to differ. 

&gt;  A 2011 study led by Colt Meier, a psychology doctoral candidate at the University of Houston showed that **hormone therapy was associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress, as well as increased quality of life** in a sample of more than 400 transgender men.

[From the American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/04/transgender.aspx)

&gt; Medical treatment options include, for example, feminization or masculinization of the body through hormone therapy and/or surgery, which are effective in alleviating gender dysphoria **and are medically necessary for many people.**

...

&gt; **The vast majority of follow-up studies have shown an undeniable beneficial effect of sex reassignment surgery** on postoperative outcomes such as subjective well being, cosmesis, and sexual function (De
Cuypere et al., 2005; Garaffa, Christopher, &amp; Ralph, 2010; Klein &amp; Gorzalka, 2009)

...

&gt; **Favorable effects of therapies that included both hormones and surgery were reported in a comprehensive review of over 2000 patients in 79 studies** (mostly observational) conducted between 1961 and 1991 (Eldh, Berg, &amp; Gustafsson, 1997; Gijs &amp; Brewaeys, 2007; Murad et al., 2010; Pf̈afflin &amp; Junge, 1998)

...

&gt; Most patients have reported improved psychosocial outcomes, ranging between 87% for MtF patients and 97% for FtM patients (Green &amp; Fleming, 1990). Similar improvements were found in a Swedish study in which
**“almost all patients were satisfied with sex reassignment at 5 years, and 86% were assessed by clinicians at follow-up as stable or improved in global functioning”** (Johansson, Sundbom, Hojerback, &amp; Bodlund, 2010).

...

&gt; **Patients who underwent sex reassignment therapy (both hormonal and surgical intervention) showed improvements in their mean gender dysphoria scores**, measured by the Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale. Scores for body dissatisfaction and psychological function also improved in most categories. Fewer than 2% of patients expressed regret after therapy. This is the largest prospective study to affirm the results from retrospective studies that a combination of hormone therapy and surgery improves gender dysphoria
and other areas of psychosocial functioning.

Every source I have seen in my travels indicates that physical transition (hormones, surgery) improves quality of life. The general overview of transitioning itself also seems to indicate that the hardest and most aggravating thing isn't getting surgery, it's coming out socially and facing repercussions like loss of friends, family, loved ones, and desperately needed social support.

£2bn a week is the weekly value of the deficit.  £100bn a year.  We can't keep spending £100bn a year more than we generate in revenues because the cost of paying the interest on that grows and grows etc.  Total national debt is £1500bn, I'm not suggesting that should ever be 0.

But the world is at a precipice where a significant proportion of governments are heading towards positions where a default on a proportion of their nation debt (£1500bn for UK) is likely.  This has been staved off by the enormous QE experiment which is why we are in untested waters.

Yes, the richest are still contributing more than everyone else, and more than ever before but they're still getting richer whilst everyone else gets poorer. This isn't a pretend grand injustice, this is the reality of neoliberalism: the wealth is evermore concentrated in the hands of the few, predominantly in finance. And it is they, not the poor, who traded toxic CDOs passed off as triple A debt, and they that financed and ran the securitization chain which lead directly to the housing foreclosure crisis in the USA which left the banks without capital and ultimately triggered the financial crisis.

However what the other commenter has touched upon is that the south of the country isn't all wealthy, and not every ill in our country can be attributed to it and Big Bad London; moreover, while you can point to its wealth in some areas as an example of how the system is broken, you also can't deny that those areas are somewhat productive.

**La Roche-Posay Toleriane**: This is not too heavy, and doesn't give me any redness, breakouts, nothing. I have very sensitive acne-prone skin. If you have very dry skin it might not be enough for you, but for my combo skin it works like a charm.   
**Sebamed Clear Face Gel**: This one works great for me in the summer, it's a light gel. But again, not a heavy moisturizer at all, so if you have dry skin it might not be moisturizing enough for you. Very good for acne-prone skin.

And another thing I have found works for me, is layering thin products instead of using heavy creams. Heavy creams tend to break me out (clog pores maybe?). Maybe something you could try. Best of luck!

The rest of your comment is a bunch of ridiculous strawman arguments - easy to argue against because no one is making any of those arguments.

For example, if someone says ""The UK is unbalanced, the South East has too much wealth and power"", you find it hard to respond to, since it's true. So instead you dishonestly accuse the arguer of ""despising a whole region"", ""blaming everything on us"" and so on. It's cheap and intellectually lazy.

That said at a lesser club he'd likely drive many a midfield in that role. I always get kind of die hard ""ramires is top quality"" comments when I've criticized him, more here than in r/soccer, and I cannot disagree more. As you've agreed he is average. I think that fans cling to a goal vs barcelona and like you said flashes of a player in (generously) 10 percent of his play and they mistake quantity of work rate for quality. 

compare him to willian, who though not faultless is the engine of the pace of our midfield box to box. Ramires is easily outclassed and has been for a while. 

I also think that when the whole bans/injuries playing cesc in an AM role stuff started mikel was his selection but he has been limited by an injury. I dunno I just feel that mou thinks mikel is dependable for putting a wall at the line of our defensive third of the field and that's a role he covets. Could another player do that? sure but the almost complacent I'll show up to work and do what I'm asked attitude means mikel is still of value to him and the club. 

All I see with ramires is a block to a productive DM when matic of fabregas isn't playing that role. He either buys someone smartly for the role this summer or looks to our loanees/youth. And that's a whole different discussion about what I'd like to see happen and what will likely happen.

If a club like Tottenham can show aspiration and fire managers because they didn't make top 4 after spending same money on players, why can't we see it as failure.

I don't really have a persecution complex. My comment is aimed at your tone and arguments made in general on the thread, not just that one post - probably should've made it clear I think the post you were responding to was also simplistic. 

&gt; That's what I referred to as arrogance. How is that not arrogant?

Its throwing in the word ""typical"" and painting us all with the same brush like you've been doing elsewhere.

&gt; The rest of your comment is a bunch of ridiculous strawman arguments - easy to argue against because no one is making any of those arguments.

They're what your comments and the comments of people who think like you drive at. 

&gt; For example, if someone says ""The UK is unbalanced, the South East has too much wealth and power"", you find it hard to respond to, since it's true. 

Err, read my comment, I said the UK *is* unbalanced and a lot of the south of England *does* get too much investment and power. That's not me finding it ""hard to respond to because its true"" like I don't want it to be, its what I really believe.

&gt;  So instead you dishonestly accuse the arguer of ""despising a whole region"", ""blaming everything on us"" and so on. It's cheap and intellectually lazy.

No, I'm accusing you of it (perhaps I was a bit hyperbolic but my general point stands) because its the tone you strike throughout your comments here and because actually there are people out there who make the argument frequently that the south east is uniformly dragging the rest of us down. It *is* cheap to suggest that I only agree that the UK is unbalanced because I can't argue against it, implying I want to, not because its my conviction.

&gt; It's ironic you mention being a Labour voter. Because any time Labour want to raise taxes, we get the whole ""why do you hate the rich?"" and ""you're just envious of our success"" nonsense. Presumably you find that annoying? I certainly do. I don't hate the rich or envy them - I just think the system is unfair.

Yes, I do find it annoying, as do millions of Labour and many Lib Dem voters throughout the south who are not concentrated enough to take seats historically in a lot of areas, including those from marginals, from places like Cornwall etc. And of course those from London which by the way is strongly Labour but that always gets cast aside in these arguments.

&gt; So why, then, do you insist on using similar arguments to people in poorer regions of the UK? ""Oh you just hate all of us don't you?"" No, we don't.

...because throughout this thread your comments display a chip on your shoulder. I'm not targeting you just because you're from a poorer region, I'm criticising you because of *your* characterisation of other regions. Perhaps you don't hate everyone in the south but like a few people you seem to really have it in for the south by association because a lot of it votes Conservative and because a lot of it is well off. 

&gt; ""You're just jealous of our success"" etc etc

I don't believe that, but what was that about strawmen again?

&gt; You make it about ""hate"", because it's easier to argue against.

No, you're the one making it about hate because of the tone you use and the way you portray the problems of this country. You're the one talking about typical south eastern arrogance, about how the south eastern minority are imposing austerity on the rest. You accuse me in response of making a strawman out of you by doing exactly the same thing. 

I actually agree with you on many political points I suspect, and I'm sorry if I overstated the extent of your belief, but whether or not it is your intention your language comes across as just a scapegoating of the south east for every problem that unfortunately IS a problematic opinion that some people hold.

Its not really comparable in the Liverpool is in England the leading member in the union, Ireland and Scotland were separate kingdoms which were incorporated into England essentially.

My point is that like partition, people never voted for joining the union and thats worth remembering. Thats not saying they want to leave it now although Scotland will inevitably leave. The case in Ireland (Wales was never a kingdom and was always part of England in that sense it is a tad irrelevant here) is that a majority would vote to stay within the UK, because lets be honest its the status quo and offers more certainty. That argument applies to many cases and is one of the reasons British people will cop on and stay in the EU.

My point isnt that NI should get more seats because proportionately they shouldnt (although PRSTV or MMP would be a much greater alternative to FPTP), that is the nature of democracy. My point was that the process that led to the system we have no was far from democratic.

We don't have control over world market (which of course is what caused the 2008 crash let's not forget - our debt and borrowing was seen as just fine before then many conveniently forget).  We can control our investments and spending obviously.  The key difference you and I have (I think) is  the belief that NOW is the time to invest and get economy going by boosting (most especially with such low interest rates).  Cutting is not the answer to growth and even in simple terms this is true.

If anyone wants to learn more look up Keynesian economics and Paul Krugman.  

&gt; Is it right that people alive now vote to receive benefits that they are unwilling to pay for, 

I am starting to think you are not very reasoned after all.  Might I remind you the majority of gov expenditures goes to Pensions, not the poor or those on welfare.  Then start to look at tax dodging/avoideance, corporate welfare and tax dodgeing and the real problems get clearer to me.  The *vast* majority of our gdp growth has gone to the 1%, and corps are at record level profits.  This is where the re-addressing needs to happen.  Our tax intake used to be much larger from corporations and the rich....

It was his and most of the squads first champions league, and believe it or not we aren't one of the best teams in Europe. It's a learning curve, that everyone goes through. Rodgers is a manager who learns from his mistakes. Admittedly Liverpool were appalling first half of the season, but a lot of that came from a shift in team identity. That still hasn't been fully resolved but is a lot better than what it was. And you can't use the FA Cup 'scrapes' as evidence, it's renowned for being a competition where league positions and form go out of the window, Wigan and Hull in the last two years proved that alone.

No, but no one is fine with that level.. The whole point of the debate is who is better to take the club forward. Rodgers has made strides from where we were, it's undeniable. He said himself when he came in it was a 5 year project, so clearly he needs time. You hyperbolise when you say we are on a mid table level, cause we clearly aren't, we're 5th.

So poor in cup competitions? How? Take a step back, aside from the match against Villa, we made two domestic semi finals. It's not poor. It's  not ideal, but not poor.

Klopp admittedly would be more appealing than Rodgers, but if we aren't in the champions league the club won't be able to attract the level we need anyway, unless, of course the owners break the bank like Man U did last year.
To be fair Torres and Johnson came in when Man City weren't around and Liverpool were always in the top 4. Whilst Suarez was nowhere near what he is today, and the same goes for Coutinho and Sturridge. 

End of the day we both want the same thing, improvement. I do believe the biggest issue is with the owners and wages. Things could be very different if that was changed.

null,false,negotiationtable,null,null,null,"Are you talking about WhaleMeatFantasy?  We can obviously ask them but if I am correct, they are not defending the abuse.  Their position is not equivalent to that.  They are saying that, although it is wrong, the person was abused.  And there are things that are outside their control to fix this, like imprison the people.  Or there are things that they can control to fix it.  I don't see them saying the abuse was correct, on the contrary.  Nobody should receive abuse nor should they be subjected to it, for their appearance.  I can't see anyone espousing that opinion here.  

I think what WhaleMeatFantasy is doing is observing what reality is, not what it should be ideally.  And reality was she was being bullied because of her appearance on the street.  This was wrong and shouldn't have happened and she shouldn't need to change.  However, reality being what it is, those bullies likely would not bully her had her appearance been conventional.  If she just looked like a guy they wouldn't have sensed weakness.  So WhaleMeatFantasy is saying that was one of the options available to her.  Now she shouldn't have to have a more conventional appearance, but it was one of the options available to her to prevent the abuse.  

No one is saying that it is right that she should think about this choice, no one is saying it is anybody elses fault but the unthinking pricks who taunted her.

A spokesperson for Kia said in a statement it would be certain not to market any future car as a ""Provo"" in the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland,[10] Adding ""This car is a showcase, it's a little bit of frivolity, it's for a motor show in Switzerland designed by an Italian at a design studio in Frankfurt.""[11] Campbell also tried to pass a motion in the European Parliament to ban the word ""Pravda"" from the Italian dictionary. While the motion was unsuccessful, Campbell promised to continue his fight, saying ""The use of this word shows Italy's support for terrorism. I'm surprised the British government has not forced the Italians to withdraw this word, as well as others which sound similar to words used by the IRA.""[12]

In November 2014, Campbell became embroiled in a controversy after derisively parodying the Irish language while addressing the Northern Ireland Assembly. Mocking the tradition of nationalist MLAs to begin addressing the Assembly with the Irish words ""go raibh maith agat, Ceann Comhairle"" (""thank you, Speaker""), he opened a question about minority language policy saying ""curry my yoghurt, can coca coalyer"", an anglicised corruption of the Irish. Campbell stated that he was unwilling to apologise, and was temporarily censured.[13]In inflammatory comments on the Irish language, he announced,""“On behalf of our party let me say clearly, and slowly so that Caitríona Ruane and Gerry Adams understand, we will never agree to an Irish Language Act at Stormont and we will treat their entire wish list as no more than toilet paper.”[14]""

The Europeans would also take Muslim captives as slaves and the Muslims would take European captives as slaves, but neither would sell their own people.

1. I've always bought my cars outright. Having said that, I'm still relatively young, and I consider a car to be a tool to get me from A to B, rather than a luxury. On average, I'd say I've spent maybe £600/car since I started driving, which averages out to around £33 a month if it only lasts me 18 months, this is how I compare it to monthly payments if you're looking at loan payments. 

2. I tend to put away about £100 a month for future car expenses. This includes tax + insurance (£50/month), and future purchases and/or repairs (£50/month). Car repairs can get expensive, and as I drive cheaper cars, I can walk away from massive bills if I need to (I've only done this once, when my old Clio failed its MOT and the garage wanted £1100 to fix everything. I went and bought a Fiesta for £500 to replace it).

3. You shouldn't be adding anything on for a recent MOT - that should be standard. Additionally, if you can, try and get either a) the full service history (abbreviated to FSH in car adverts), or b) an up-to-date service from within the last month or two. If the seller doesn't have either, ask to get one done before you commit to buying. It would be courteous to offer to pay for the service IF IT PASSES, if the seller doesn't already request it. Don't pay for a service if the car fails, that's on the seller to sort out).

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** First impression on back of hand, it looks a bit like gel-lotion and has a whitecast at first but dissipates after a few minutes. There is less shine than others and lot less tackiness. It doesn't feel heavy and the tackiness subsides more in the following 30 minutes. It eventually dries down to how the Fluid Ultra-Light feels after an hour.

On the face, unfortunately, it feels heavier, although still lighter than most milk/lotion/cream ss, and it stays greasy and tacky even after 30 minutes. I had to blot, but then it became decent and makes a good makeup base. Worst of all for me is the whitecast. It doesn't dissipate and on my skin, it's really apparent. I was so disappointed as I was looking forward to spend Eur7 a month for a face sunscreen. :(

I can see this works well for NC25 and up. Unfortunately, darker peeps have to look somewhere else.

On the body, it has *really* strong whitecast that never dissipates on me. This is just ridiculous to wear on my skintone. And I'm not one who's bothered by whitecast on the body.
The texture stays slippery and a tad greasy on my skin and is easily moved around, making me having lack of confidence for its protection. Although, many people have claimed for its superior sun protection. I have never put this into rigorous testing, so I'll just take their words.
I also found that it's not that water-resistance. It gets easily washed off and leaving no residue whatsoever. Reapplication has to be diligent.

I personally wouldn't want to repurchase this. Boots Soltan Baby Lotion is proven to have amazing protection, water resistance, acceptable texture and NO whitecast. It's much cheaper, too.

I just went over my actual budget, and it's closer to £60/month (£15 tax and £42 insurance). However, I have been driving for 5 years, and have 5 years no claims which helps keep my yearly premiums below £500, and I pay it off in a lump sum to avoid the high APR paying insurance monthly. My first year of driving I think I paid about £1800 for insurance on a £700 Vauxhall Corsa :(

A tip for insurance; in your first year or two, if your parents or guardians have a good driving history, add them as named drivers to your policy when you're looking for quotes. Even if you don't live with them, and they're never going to drive it, it can bring it down quite substantially. That £1800 I paid started out as £2500 before I added my mother to the policy (with her 25 year unblemished driving history). 

Also, don't forget about petrol. I drive very little now that I live in the city (&lt;6k miles a year), but I'm still paying ~£30 a month to keep it running, and I don't have an especially low mpg car (2003 MG ZR).

In a way white kids *are* easy meat *because there are far far more of them*. Why is that so damned hard to understand? If you want to rob banks and 9 out of 10 are have the colour red in their logo, can we assume you are colour-motivated if 9 out of 10 of your robberies have red victims?

That is literally the level of logic being applied here. Apparently said robber was ""targeting"" red banks.

Oh, dear god. Another muppet.

ALL cases like this were ignored at that time. The police paid no heed to ANY statutory rape cases at that time. Shit, they barely paid any attention to the violent rape of adults until the mid 90s. Even today there are new cases of them not giving a fuck and sweeping things under carpet to improve their figures.

Are you daft? No one wants you to repent for any goddamn sins. I fucking swear, white people and their victim complexes. For fuck sake, your entire wealth and position in society is down to the fact at one point it was OKAY to discriminate against people on the basis of tans = inferior. This enabled a huge amount of social benefits for you from the simple ""you are considered the epitome of attractive"" to the problematic ""white people are inherently more competent and intelligent"". These stereotypes take goddamn centuries to die out. 

I repeat. The people who fucked our economy were rich, predominantly white and American. I can differentiate between the stock traders who worked in securities, the real estate agents and the politicians who created sub-prime mortgage booms resulting in the last market crash. I can differentiate between them and their employees who did as they were told. I can differentiate between them AND other rich people like Bill Gates and Wayne Rooney as not being related. The people who benefitted were the few. The people who got fucked were us. Not all Americans, Rich People or even FInance People were involved in this. Now you are looking at the same thing in Africa. 

And it doesn't matter if African kings are doing it, does it mean that we had to too? And it was our DEMAND that created the supply. We weren't roaming around and suddenly decided on a whim to take some slaves off the hands of some African King. We wanted slaves to work our farms so we simply got some from Africa which was a very fragmented nation making slave raiding easier until the UK developed the indebtured labourer. 

No one is forcing us to accept unprecedented numbers of immigrants, what we are attracting are people who work in sectors we are not willing to. Our inner city youth who have high levels of unemployment do not want to work on farms or on the NHS which are the big sources of immigrant employers. It's like our A&amp;E crisis... Ever wonder how our A&amp;Es worked? Well? Remember Indians are the biggest source of employees for the NHS. We stopped overseas applicants trying to get more in from the EU but EU doctors come in on Locums, do not speak English and frankly have no reason to stay. Net result? More doctors local doctors leave to Australia and Indians who were excellent A&amp;E doctors got sent home. So we gutted our own A&amp;E and crewed it with newbie doctors who burned out quickly from the stress (those Indian doctors already survived India. The UK's a lot easier on the wok loads) losing us even more doctors. 

It's not a straw man. 30% of the NHS's consultants trained abroad. You are accepting economic migrants because they do jobs other people were not willing to do.

&gt;If Yokohama is so insistent on Chelsea having an Asian player in the squad, then having him go out on loan defeats the purpose of signing him. What good will signing the youngster do for Yokohama if he is spending the season playing in another team’s shirt?

Maybe. But a loan where he (let's suppose) does extremely well and comes back to become a part of Chelsea's XI, that would interest Yokohama/Japanese fans more than him sticking around with the reserves. Also, the loan is also hugely influenced by he (expected) denial of a UK work permit.

Neither are Basel, Ludo or Besiktas.

&gt; It's a learning curve, that everyone goes through. Rodgers is a manager who learns from his mistakes. 

There any evidence for this? what exactly has he improved on in the last 12 months? I can't see anything. It wasn't just this season's european results  either... in his first season we lost to Udinese, Anzhi,Zenit and  drew against Young Boys in the Europa. 

&gt;So poor in cup competitions? How? Take a step back, aside from the match against Villa, we made two domestic semi finals. It's not poor. It's not ideal, but not poor.

Come on, we had free tickets to both semi finals... in the League Cup we only had to beat Middlesborough, Swansea and Bournemouth..

&gt;You hyperbolise when you say we are on a mid table level, cause we clearly aren't, we're 5th.

Yep 5th right now, we could easily finish 7th.. we're closer to that than 4th.

&gt;Klopp admittedly would be more appealing than Rodgers, but if we aren't in the champions league the club won't be able to attract the level we need anyway, unless, of course the owners break the bank like Man U did last year. To be fair Torres and Johnson came in when Man City weren't around and Liverpool were always in the top 4. Whilst Suarez was nowhere near what he is today, and the same goes for Coutinho and Sturridge.

World class managers attract players easier, so we'd have a much higher chance. City were around when we brought in Johnson and all the others apart from Torres afaik. But Suarez was regardest as a very good player after the WC yet and was scoring for fun for Ajax and the national team we still signed him..

The biggest issue is Brendan being a bad manager over the last 10months, nothing to do with owners&amp;wages.. no one would have cared if we had finished 5th but made it further in the cup competitions this year and there was a real chance to do so.

You'd be surprised at how many companies lack a firm understanding of the apprenticeship system even when they seek to hire one. So you may have to explain the funding situation to them yourself.

Now, you write these people off as ""idiots"" as if they don't  matter.  We were all young once, and these can be teenagers going in to these agreements.  Yes, it's not the brightest move, but that doesn't mean they deserve to be left to a cycle of unmanageable debt.

And when you say it involves ""ignoring"" the debt, you're not acknowledging the tight financial situation that these people are in.  Maybe to you it's trivial to pay back a hundred quid, but there are people who genuinely live on a shoestring budget.  

You borrow £100, because your rent is due and you're a bit short this month.  But maybe then your car breaks and the choice is between paying the loan back and getting it fixed, and your job depends on that car.  No brainer, right?  Only another £20 if you pay it back next paycheque.  Except it isn't, it's compound interest, hiked because it's past payment due, and a fine for late payment, so now you owe them £230.  If it's a good month, you've got, let's say, £120 to spare and you send it to Wonga.  You feel like a responsible person, you've got debts, but you're paying them off as fast as you can.  Next payday rolls around, you've eaten ramen all month, you've got £120 left again.  You ask Wonga how much you owe them now.  They tell you, it's three hundred pounds.

You're now throwing money as fast as you can at the problem but you have no earthly way of making money fast enough to pay it off.  Now, this is a fairly modest sum, calculated using Wonga's 1509% representative rate for late payments.  It's also a fairly responsible person, earning a low wage, who's been forced into one bad decision.  Now they're a slave to debt, their quality of life decreases exponentially no matter what they do.  Imagine if it'd been a larger loan?  More than one loan?  What if they were stupid enough to try and pay off the loan with another loan, and maybe a bit more to treat themselves to a night out?

Aside from the obvious fact that SNP are doing well at the ballot box, they're actually in a pretty miserable position from that point of view. They know that an overwhelming number of Scottish voters are more ""anti-Tory"" than anything else, and key to getting them to be OK with voting for them instead of Labour is to persuade them that a vote for them is exactly as likely to result in a Tory government as a vote for Labour would be- nil. 

Historically, SNP have actually been rather better friends with the Tories than they have been with Labour- bringing down a Labour government on Thatcher's behalf in the 1970s, and working with the Tories in the last Scottish Parliament. That means that they only way they've been able to shed that attack is by making it crystal clear, over and over again, that they will block the Tories and support Labour.

It had never been done in Classic Who, but New Who did a lot of things that had never been done in Classic Who. That was kind of the point.

Why would the accent be one of the causes of his leaving, when he **did** use his own accent for the entire first series, and references to it were written into the script? Were they suddenly going to have the Doctor change his accent and become posh in the second season? That would make no sense.

This is going to sound really nitpicky, but [here](http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-04-20/christopher-eccleston-i-hope-ill-be-remembered-for-doctor-who---but-i-dont-watch-it) is the original interview that the article at the top of this page is pulling quotes from. This is what was said:

&gt;**I [the interviewer] wonder if he’s doomed to be remembered as the man who left Doctor Who controversially after just one series as the ninth incarnation in 2005?** *“I didn’t agree with the way things were being run, or like the culture that grew up around the series,” he said in 2011,* and now adds, **“I wanted to move him away from RP [received pronunciation] for the first time because we shouldn’t make a correlation between intellect and accent although that still needs addressing. I hope I’ll be remembered as one of the Doctors. I have no ill feeling towards the character or the series. I don’t watch it and am not keen to discuss it because I want this to be about Safe House. That’s my mortgage.”**

The parts in bold are the question the interviewer asked (to paraphrase: ""Will you always be remembered as the Doctor who left?"" or something like that) and the answer Eccleston gave. The part in italics is being added for background, and it's something Eccleston said in 2011, on the subject of *why* he left.

So when he talks about RP, he's not relating it to *why he left*. He's relating it to *how he'll be remembered*.

As for the question of why he left, [this](http://badwilf.co.uk/eccleston-explains-why-he-left-doctor-who) is the most detailed statement he's ever given about it. It was about the working conditions, the atmosphere behind the scenes, and how the higher-ups treated the people working under them. It wasn't about any of the creative decisions about how to portray the character.

Sorry if this sounds ranty. I have been trying to explain this to lots of people over the past week. The whole ""he left because of RP"" is the result of a great big reading comprehension and logic fail, and it keeps getting passed around the internet by people who should know better.
