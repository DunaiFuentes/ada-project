As for key areas, I think one term tory seats in West Yorkshire the northwest and the Midlands will switch back to labour.

However, if the snp do as well as expected and hold the balance of power, then I seriously doubt they will format a coalition with labour.

Either argue globally or nationally because you called me out on it. also most FGM cases, Globally and nationally, are on young children (age 4) and in many places under general anesthesia.

&gt;And type II involves removal of the clitoris. So much much worse from a general and sexual health point of view than your average Western circumcision.

no that is a Type I, Type II may or may not involve such, unfortunitly most of the FGM in the UK does. it it defined differently as it removes the Labia minora (the inner folds) these are responsible for holding lubricant (preventing drips) during sexual intercourse. The male foreskin does the same job. 

&gt;And that's it then? Because you can't think of a prior example it's a bad idea?

When you made a claim that it was better, i could not think of any, asking you to provide proof for your claim is not ridiculous, your answer is.

&gt;how about the 1918 Qualification of Women Act?

because allowing female aristocracy to run while not being allowed to actually vote is a good law. rather than the representation of the people act. (fith reform) also know as the Equal Suffrage Act.

because you were already discussing it? and distorting other people opinions to sit on your high horse?

To apply for work in the UK, an employer needs to advertise the position to *everyone* in the UK and the EU first. That's a huge amount of people that you are competing with. And even so, the border agency only gives out 20,000 VIAS's per year, and prioritise jobs that are on the [shortage occupation list](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tier-2-shortage-occupation-list-from-6-april-2013).

The other option is to get a job with a US firm which has a UK office, and apply for a transfer. The company will have to sponsor you, but it is a lot easier than getting in the former way. 

Theres simply no other way to work in the UK. If you come over on a holiday VISA (a working-holiday VISA is not available to US citizens) you **are not permitted to work**, and if you do and are caught you are deported and banned from entering the UK for ten years. Even on this VISA, you need to absolutely prove to the UK Border Agency you have enough savings to support yourself, and can only stay here for a few months maximum.  

If you have UK citizenship through a parent, then moving is a lot easier. But without it, your chances are slim-to-none.

THe underspend is a ridiculous red herring:   

&gt;From here: Guide to the Scottish Budget http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/S4/SB_11-74.pdf
UNDERSPEND UK Government accounting rules deem that Departments and devolved administrations are not permitted to overspend in a financial year. This means that the Scottish Parliament cannot authorise expenditure in excess of the total assigned budget and other sources of income. The Treasury’s Statement of Funding Policy, lays out the arrangements for funding the devolved administrations as follows: “Breaches in DELs which materialise at the end of the year would be viewed by the United Kingdom Government as serious mismanagement on the part of the devolved administration and the presumption would be that the following year’s DEL and grant to the devolved administration would be reduced by an amount equivalent to the breach. The same rule applies to departments of the United Kingdom Government” (Treasury 2010). However, the rules relating to unspent monies (known as underspends) were relaxed in the late 1999s by the then UK Government. Prior to the late 1990s, any departmental underspend would automatically transfer back to the centre. However, the introduction of End Year Flexibility (EYF) allowed departments and devolved administrations to carry forward unspent monies from one year to the following. This was partly as a result of the move to Spending Reviews which outlined three-year DELs, but was also designed to prevent the practice of inefficient spending by departments concerned at losing money – in essence “spending for the sake of it” at the end of financial year. The Coalition Government elected in 2010 ended this system of EYF and introduced a “Budget Exchange Mechanism” (BEM) in its place. This system allowed for a limited amount of unspent monies to be carried over from one year to the next. Departments and devolved administrations would inform the Treasury in November what they were expecting to underspend in that financial year. Any underspend beyond that amount would return to the centre. Accumulated underspends were also to be returned to the centre as part of the BEM. This was not a great problem for the Scottish Government who had run down their accumulated underspends in previous years. However, the Northern Ireland Assembly and Welsh Assembly Governments had built up underspends over a number of years and, under the new BEM, lost that money to the centre. The Finance Ministers Quadrilateral meeting of 14 July 2011 agreed a modification to this arrangement. Devolved administrations would be allowed to carry over unspent monies from year to year up to a set limit, rather than having to estimate anticipated underspends to Treasury in November. It was agreed that the Scottish Government would be allowed to carry over up to a maximum 0.6% of Resource DEL and 1.5% of Capital DEL from one financial year to the next.

It was for people who had decided to take a different course in life and did not have relevent tertiary education.  Not having a science degree was not any sort of handicap because that was the point of the course.

I can't honeslty remember a hell of a lot of detail about it - I just remmber thinking that if there was anybody that was more suited to this course than me then they must be an already half-trained doctor who's dad was on the board for the course.

Here you go then pedant. I'll link you to articles that anyone will have seen if they so much as glanced at any mainstream news site or newspaper in the last 12 months, which point out that the funding for the new student loans system was grossly underestimated...

* [Here's one](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/18/tuition-fees-student-loans-must-change-higher-education-commission). 

* [Here's another](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29933282). 

* [Why not have a third](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/nov/06/call-student-loans-review-rejected-government). 

* [Oh fuck it, here's a fourth](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/12/higher-education-budget-multibillion-shortfall). 

* [Fifth?](http://www.reddit.com/message/unread/)

* [Six](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/11366155/Student-loans-the-real-cost-could-be-40000-more-than-official-estimates.html) (...because its the devils number, and clearly for you, the devil is in the detail). 

So basically, just about anybody that gives a fuck thinks the new student loans system failed to use a realistic model of income for the loans it was delivering, coupled with an at best 'optimistic' assessment of graduate earnings and at worst positively deceptive misrepresentation of their earnings. The outcome will be that the treasury is now issuing loans to students by proxy of the universities worth vast sums of money, which the treasury will largely fail to recoup from graduates. Some estimates are saying up to 40% of the debt could end up written off of graduates accounts when they hit the end of their loan terms (after all, it's a loan with a fixed term... not a tax contrary to what that fucker Clegg would have us believe) with the treasury footing the shortfall.

If the OP already has a phone that works, they wont benefit from changing the phone in terms of cost. Either their contract no longer has a mandatory term (in which case they can just change the contract and keep the phone) or it does (in which case they will need to pay it off either way).

The biggest drain on phone batteries generally are having the screen on and sending/recieving data. If the OP plans on only using their phone for calls and text messages, they will hardly check their phone and the data they send/receive will be minimal.

On top of that if they already have a smart phone and it's an android phone they can put it into ""ultra stamina mode"" which basically removes all non-essential phone functions (i.e. it turns off all mobile data etc) in which case a modern smartphone would probably last 3 days if not longer.

If they are looking to save money, their best bet would be to not bother changing the phone at all.

So before I tell the OP what I think they should do based on my fairly long history in UK mobile retail, I wanted to know why they are looking to replace the phone to make sure my suggestion is correct.

Anyway police stupidly blocked off Gloucester Rd, Welsh police got hard with Bristol residents, so what happened? The drunk crowd on a night out find the street blocked, and of course it devolves into a fight, and looting. I was sat in the Highbury Vaults at that time, and predicted that by 12 at latest, they would have moved on to Cabot circus, since, really, what is there to loot on Gloucester Rd. Sure enough, they hit a Jewelry store at Cabot circus at about 1 am. Real political.  
  
In conclusion, the whole anti-Tesco thing was ill-reasoned, ill-prepared, and devolved into nothing but senseless violence on both sides. I for one am thankful for having a non-ripoff option to buy groceries on Gloucester Rd., because in difference to the Trustafarians I cannot afford to eat out all the time, or shop at that (admittedly nice) organic farm salad store (which, again, doesn't even compete with Tesco).

Since you're looking for a fairly cheap phone, I'd recommend buying the phone and signing up for the SIM only separately as it nearly always works out cheaper. 

As for international sims, Lebara and others offer specific international SIMs, and Vodafone usually offer extras which can give you cheap calls to those countries.

&gt;

&gt;It has been alleged that the British used chemical weapons in Mesopotamia in 1920, during the [Iraqi revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_revolt_against_the_British) (*Ath Thawra al Iraqiyya al Kubra*), in the period of the [British Mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Mesopotamia). The use of [tear gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_gas), and not ""only the most deadly gases"", was considered; as shown in a [War Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Office) minute of 12 May 1919 in which [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) argued

&gt;&gt;


&gt;""I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. We have definitely adopted the position at the Peace Conference of arguing in favour of the retention of gas as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of [lachrymatory gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachrymatory_agent). I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses: gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected.""

The point I am trying to make is that Unionists want to maintain the Union while Nationalists will be a majority in less than 20 years and Unionists will need Nationalists to keep NI in the UK after they become the minority.
Yet they continue with the marches, flags and laugh at our want to promote our language. Can you imagine a Green order in a UI flaunting everything Irish and rubbing it in and winding up unionists. That would never happen. But unionists do it everyday.

The facts remain that colonialism is now viewed as wrong on the world stage. The partition of Ireland was undemocratic. These crimes are celebrated when there should be an apology instead. 
 
The native population has suffered greatly and repeatedly at the hands of the administration that still have a hold today. Not only that but there is a population who flaunt that fact. That population came here on a mission to systematically wipe out the native culture. I cant forget that and neither can anyone who has done any research regarding Irish history. Taking everything into account a UI is the honorable outcome, the right outcome, the inevitable outcome and the only outcome.

It is of course shocking that you don't even acknowledge this. You seem to think the Japanese were so much better than those ""evil"" Brits. Now I know you didn't say that, so maybe now you can understand what it is like to have words put in your mouth. It's not fair on the other.

I also have no problem with the theory that by resetting the universe some of the newly learned memories get tangled up with the other memories of the same person. So the doctor knows what happened, Amy knew what happened, Rose remembered, etc.

Now here comes my problem:

Auton-Rory goes on and experiences a lot of stuff - the whole Lone Centurion thing. And what I don't understand is, how the Human-Rory can have the memories Auton-Rory gained. I don't see how they're not two separate entities.

Unless something utterly differs in the above explanation on the part of how I remember stuff, the only way would be if the memories of Auton- and Human-Rory are somehow tangled (like quantum entanglement) and tbh, I don't like this explanation one bit because then the memory-copy-procedure would be a) over-the-top complicated and b) the Autons would become unreliable because they would constantly be influenced on how their Human counterpart would behave.",null,0,null,1422464527,null,0,false,0,co3my1g,null,t3_2tyq93,null,t1_co3my1g,null,t1_co3l803,null,null,null,1424342868,null,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6,null

You know why these left movements never succeed when attempted? Because at the end of the day, humans are flawed. We're all out for our own self interest. 

A thought experiment. 

I put you and someone else of similar political leaning into a room. In the room is enough food and water for one person to just about survive 2 months. I tell you I won't let either of you out for 2 months. 

How long until one of you is killed? I put it to you that it wouldn't take long at all.. Might share at the start, but one of you will give in and do what needs to be done. 

It's self preservation. Survival of the fittest.. It's the concept that allowed us to crawl out of the primordial goo. It will always be a part of us. 

Capitalism is good because it feeds on this desire to survive and be better than the other guy, while still offering the other guy something. It's a mutually beneficial system in an overall sense (50 guys get very rich, while 5,000 guys get money for food and housing), but a deeply unfair one when you compare one for one (CEO has a boat, lowest earning worker rents a bedsit).. 

However it takes into account the fact that the CEO will exist regardless. If he's not exploiting people in a capitalistic system, he'll do it in your socialistic utopia regardless of if you want him to or not. Because where there's a will there's a way. 

What capitalism does well is that anyone can rise up from that worker status to CEO status.. There's nothing inherently holding them back. 

It's not perfect though. You still need government to provide a safety net and basic services such as healthcare, education and some kind of welfare. 

But from reading the Greens proposals they're more concerned with bringing everyone down than attempting to raise everyone up.. And when that's your goal people will revolt. The same people who are the CEO's of companies now would be the ones forming a revolution and overthrowing the Green government because their need or desire to raise themselves up above others isn't being met. 

That's just the way it is. To ignore the human factor of society is naive.  ",null,0,null,1422465009,null,0,false,0,co3n8xh,null,t3_2ty50m,null,t1_co3n8xh,null,t1_co3mg8x,null,null,null,1424342726,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

1. Medical School
2. FY1+2

4. Consultant

Alongside that, there are also ongoing Junior and Consultant contract negotiations - the govt. want to remove pay progression AND banding.

&gt;The government also insisted on a reduction in the breaks that junior doctors are allowed to take during shifts, arguing that it would be safe for doctors to take just one 30-minute break in a ten-hour shift.

&gt;""The government told us that it only prepared to pay for unscheduled hours worked if they had been authorised in advance and that it was not prepared to pay for unscheduled hours incurred when junior doctors exercised their clinical judgement.

&gt;Instead, the government told us that it expects junior doctors to demonstrate their professionalism by working additional hours without pay.""

Which sums up the contempt that they have for us really. Although, some days I struggle to come by 30 bleep free minutes in a row.

When you come to FY1, you'll be doing the same work as the the rest of us have done in our first year out - except for less money real terms (best case scenario - given that pay is frozen again for 2015/16 - without even the 1% that was recommended but refused last year) or much less (20-50% if they unilaterally remove banding)

null,false,cardboardtube_knight,amy,Amy,null,"I think it's really hard to write time travel and have it make total sense. The reason that you're probably noticing it more now is the fact that the show seems to be about *time travel*. Before season five time travel was a vehicle the show used to get us to a certain point, basically it served the same function as time travel in Quantum Leap, it was how we explained how we could be there (occasionally, a lot of the stories were set in present day). 

Now time travel is also part of the plot. Things are done with it that aren't just travel related and they effect the characters along with the setting. The best example I can think of off the top of my head is Girl Who Waited. These things make a plot muddier because time travel is very theoretical and most things that feature it heavily and go into it don't even get it consistent in the same episode.

But that's not what's being proposed. 

&gt;You realise that starting a business is fucking hard? 

Yes, I have my own.

&gt;That most likely you're risking millions of pounds in debt, working ridiculous hours for years on end?

My capital investment was £300. So no, it doesn't always need millions in investment. Unless you're a multi national, which I'm opposed to in their entirety, so it makes little to no difference to me if it's harder for millionaires to exploit people. 

&gt;All so that a few snotty nose teenagers you ask to work late one night get pissy and can just take your business?

Again, not what's being suggested. You're making your own assumptions here, that doesn't validate your point, it's just creating far flung situations that'll never happen.

Well it has hence the new hyperbolic headlines of ""spending back to 1930s levels"". 

&gt;Growth comes from all sources. However historically struggling private sectors have only been rebooted by state action. That is also precisely what happened with this government.

It does and a reasonable level of national investment is sensible, but that stimulus has to be taken away eventually and given the current state of finances borrowing to grow is not a option.

&gt;The only crisis likely to appear is a return of 2010 if real austerity is actually attempted again.

Greece has had to endure far more severe cuts than we have and they are returning to growth, it just takes longer, we can't spend our future forever, someone has to pay eventually. Even if we go with Labour's watered down deficit reduction we are just going to add more and more debt for future generations.

Nearly ten years ago I visited a BMW factory near Birmingham and even then they had autonomous robots that loaded up (automatically) parts from the store room and then moved them to the correct place on the factory line. These robots moved along a predefined path on the factory floor and neatly skirted around us as we walked on by. Ten years ago.

If anything, haulage will be one of the first industries to get automated. Besides diesel costs, paying the driver to drive, stop every three hours, and sleep is a major expense. Imagine how much quicker stuff would arrive if the truck kept on driving? You could dispense with fueling up and just swap out the tractor units every so often.

So what are you *actually* saying to me here?  What is the point that you have been making?

Let me break this down:

I made my original comment in reference to the guardian article.  My reply could be said to respond to particularly this section:

""*Dr David Rosser, medical director of University hospitals Birmingham, one of England’s biggest trusts, said: “The NHS doesn’t have the number of doctors it needs. The shortage is real. We aren’t training enough doctors in this country, and so we are dependent on foreign-trained doctors.*""

You replied by talking about foreigners, which I didn't really understand because I hadn't mentioned foreigners at all, but I pursued the conversation and told you I hadn't said anything about foreigners - perhaps I had minunderstood something...

You then replied by saying med school places are numbered due to the likely future demand for doctors, and again reminded me that there was no problem with foreigners.  I replied by again correcting you (these innacuracies of yours were beginning to muddy the water of what we were actually talking about), and then you said the intake is closely matched to demand.  Which of course is the whole point of the article - that intake is *not* matched to demand.  Again I quote the article, '*The NHS doesn’t have the number of doctors it needs. The shortage is real*.

You then replied by linking an article that suggests we should be traing *more* doctors in the UK, because there is an increase in doctors that are leaving.  I ask you to clarify what you're talking about and you again say '*Med school intake is matched to demand for new doctors*. (which demonstrably isn't true or at least has been deomstrably ineffective due to the existance of the course which I applied for 8 years ago and points raised in the guardian article).

So I'm back to square one.  I have absolutley no idea what you are trying to tell me here.  All you've done is confuse what I orignally said - twice.  And then repeated that *Med school intake is matched to demand for new doctors* whilst the whole point of this article and the existance of the course I applied to 8 years ago (thus the motive for my original comment) suggests is not true.

What are you talking about, mate?

For example, it's highly unlikely that you'd be allowed to kill all the Jews no matter what happens. Yet I wouldn't want my party run by someone who wanted to do it, no matter how decent their other policies were.

Scaling it back to ""real"" terms, lets say the Green party: 

- desired to have ""meat-free mondays"" banning bacon rolls and beef pies from council-run staff canteens

- are against GM foods (they say they don't know the risks, and thus the risks outweigh any benefits)

- has, at least in the past 2 years, supported homeopathy

- are against animal testing (I suppose this is more allowed, despite [all the reasons
](http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/about-us/science-action-network/forty-reasons-why-we-need-animals-in-research/) it's needed).

- Seem to wish to increase funding massively without really stating where they'll get the money (hell, they want to get rid of VAT all together)

- argue for zero or even negative growth and falling levels of personal consumption because growth is incompatible with protecting the planet

Those policies, **especially** the ones where they disregard science (despite saying they'll listen more to scientists), mean I don't want to vote for them.

They agree with cannabis legalization ,they want brothels to be legalized, and both of them I can actually get behind (despite them being controversial). In most cases, their intention is all well and good. But then they go and do things like say they want to add basic income... just flat out, no means testing. Just basic income. Yet they don't even consider the astronomical cost to implement that.

Labour: Don't like Miliband (can you even imagine him negotiating with Angela Merkel or a US president?) and I just can't see any policies I like. I'm not a socialist, I think clearing the deficit is hugely important and they won't deal with the lopsided welfare system; they'll just pump money into it and call it a day. 

Tories: They have lost significant integrity by cosy ing up to UKIP plus they are going to repeal the Convention on Human Right while bolstering GCHQ 's spying which I hate so I can't vote for them even if I did like the rest of their policies. 

UKIP: I like the EU. 

Greens: I think they are naive if they think cracking down on energy companies and financial services firms to subsidise an expanded welfare system and protected public sector pay will provide a platform for any long term investment let alone green energy investment. I think they'd hurt the economy and keep spending money to achieve their ideological goals even as they take less in tax. Plus I don't like their ideas on nuclear energy, their plan to scrap HS2 and make all residential roads 20mph - sounds like massive overkill to the problem of road accidents (our roads are the safest in Europe per capita) and pollution. 

Which leaves the Lib Dems:

They like human rights, they want to liberalize drug policy, they have the best internet/digital policies, they want to invest in green energy but not so much that it will hurt the economy, they are internationalists unlike every other party and are pro-EU. They have good left of centre policies without the ideological strictures of labour or the greens. I like about 80% of what they say but I disagree with their policy to scrap Trident. You can't please everyone though. Not that you can blame Clegg for policy because policy is voted for directly by members which I think is a great idea.

You build a system around those people (capitalism) not against them.. Because attempting to go against them is completely useless. Particularly when preaching ideas such as a 'zero growth economy'.. 

In reality, these people won't even bother to try and bend the system since there's alternative countries who won't have gone full retard. They'll just go there instead and continue doing what they do.. 

Leaving the UK with zero investment, and a bunch of feckless idiots who voted in the greens to work jobs that don't exists. 

But it's okay, because the Greens will give everyone money for doing nothing. So everyone can continue buying things.. Although they're also going to levy huge import taxes because ships hurt the environment, so the only goods that people on the Basic Income can afford to purchase will be British made. But all the businesses will have closed up shop and moved to Ireland to continue making money and prospering.. So everyone just sits there, rolling around in the mess of their own making until there's a revolution and the greens are ousted and Thatcher on steroids is put in place to unfuckup the country.. But we just end up with a worse more purely capitalistic country bordering on libertarian. 

Well done. You fucked us. 

I don't know how anyone can look at this country and claim capitalism has made it worse.. By and large, we're the richest and most comfortable people on the planet.

null,false,Ornatia,null,null,null,"Apparently before Oscar Wilde's unprecedented public trial for indecency, it was commonplace in England for men to walk linking arms, holding hands, cuddling, complimenting each other and generally show affection. 

Of course this is hard to imagine today but there are plenty of photos which exist from this time of ""gay couples"" - who are probably mostly heterosexual men who are linking arms, holding hands, sitting closely, grooming each other etc. as it wasn't stigmatised or shameful in that time for men to do this and the idea of being charged with indecency and accused of homosexuality was seemingly not a realistic threat to most people 

Following the arrest of Oscar Wilde, it became very risky to show any sort of affection, or do *anything* that could even *slightly* be use to blackmail or slander or accused of being homosexual. It's theorised that our current culture of men fearing showing affection in the UK at least largely stems from avoiding being perceived as homosexual first for legal reasons, and after decriminalisation for social reasons due to stigma. 

This culture of men fearing being perceived as homosexual clearly exists to this day, and the primary reason men fear showing affection is this fear of being perceived to be homosexual, but I also think WW1 and WW2 had a lot to do with cementing the idea of ""being tough"" and subsequently avoiding such affection or vulnerability to act as a pillar of strength and support for the community in times of a need for hardness, as well as Victorian attitudes towards sex and culture in general which our current society is still largely rooted in, not just the trial of Wilde.

What you'd be better off doing is incentivising *not* having children. Your basic income is *x* and then with each child you have after your first child, your basic income is slashed. 

And while I'm at it, why is there an obsession on this subreddit that we have to get a handle on this problem before it's an actual problem? Basic income is a policy that can almost be enacted over night. Why do we need to put it into practice now long before automation is actually a problem?

Get a 2-3 kg shoulder of pork and then take

2 tbsp coriander seeds

2 tbsp cumin seeds

1½ tbsp yellow mustard seeds

1 tbsp black peppercorns

1 tbsp dark brown sugar

1 tbsp smoked paprika

1 tsp cayenne pepper

and heat the seeds in a dry frying pan, then leave to cool and then bash the hell out of them, add the the other spices combine and then rub all over the pork. Cover in cling film and leave overnight.

The next day put the pork into a roasting tin with 400ml of chicken stock and cover with foil and cook at 160 c for around 5-6 hours. 

After this set it aside and strain the fat off the stock, you will need some of this for the barbecue sauce.

For the barbecue sauce you will need.

250ml red wine vinegar

75g soft dark brown sugar

75ml bourbon whisky or dark rum

75ml oz cola

250ml tomato ketchup

splash Worcestershire sauce

200ml stock used to cook the pork in

spoon of honey.

Put the vinegar into a saucepan and reduce by half, once this has happened throw everything else in the pan and stir, let this simmer for 15 mins.

While it is simmering away shred the pork, I use two forks and leave the pieces rather large, some places chop it up small but I prefer larger pieces. 

Add the pork to the sauce and stir to cover it all and simmer for 10 more minutes.

Let me explain a brief where I am on this.

It's a good party. I know quite a few folk in it. Sure there are the whackos like in every party. But most of the politico's and candidates / representatives are competent and not dicks. Lot of things we've disagreed on in person, nukes is a big one. But its never been like arguing with dogmatic idiots, try that in other parties...

It's a good party. It's had to be for 20 or 100 years in the wilderness depending on your perspective. Pragmatism and functionality don't allow ideologues and demagogues. Corruption neither. 

But the machine of modern media, had a fun narrative to play. The junior coalition partner backed out on a core pledge. Worse than Satan.

So why am I lapsing. These days all that matters is the popular narrative. Popular narrative is they need to be punished. Punished for things like lowest income tax cuts and gay marriage (of course the Tory politico's have done a great job of making that their thing, lol are they fuck).

In like 100 years when the bullshit narratives just are no longer in play, historians will talk about how a party martyr itself because the country had to be run and the clouds of ideological perfection that so many consider to be the minimum bar were not an option.

* A main point is that when most residents do not want a Tesco's there, and never did, yet they are still able to build one. This shows the power of money, they shouldn't be able to get planning permission yet they did.

* Tesco might be cheaper with some products, but that's a given. They order everything in mass bulk, smaller shops cannot compete with this and so it's a snowball effect. Even given this fact they STILL have the nerve to overprice products through greed. Tesco is definitely, in my opinion, a rip off.

null,false,toward_the_forward,null,null,null,"&gt; To solve a shortage of doctors in 2015 you are proposing an over-supply of medical graduates in 2022

Not once did I say anything even close that.  My point was that **eight years ago** (i.e. the exact sort of med school intake time that would be having an effect **right now** which is what we're all talking about in this thread) I applied to take Medicine on a course which was specifically designed to accept people of all ages who had not already got the necessary qualifications to through the standard route towards becoming a doctor.  This course existed **eight years ago** because even at the time there was such a shortfall in homegrown doctors that courses such as the one I applied to had to be imlemented to deal with the shortfall of the future (the shortfall of the future they **they knew would occur eight years ago**).  The **future** of which they were specifically planning toward is of course the **present** at this very moment.  In regard to what should be done at present and about the number of graduates in 2022 - I have said absolutely nothing.

You know the seriously worrying thing about this conversation?  It's this:

&gt;They have cut med school intake already (2011 and 2012 intake) to 7500 to prevent oversubscription. They said they will guarantee F1 jobs for **my cohort**, but they have cut numbers to fix this issue. It's a temporary, but really annoying, blip in the annals of history.

null,false,calculusprime,null,null,null,"*""Yet they [unionists] continue with the marches, flags and laugh at our want to promote our language.""*

I'll break that one in two.

1) Not all unionists are orangemen or even terribly involved in it (30,000 orange order members out of a 'unionist' voting population of more than a million).

But it is true to say I imagine that most unionists support the right of orangemen to freedom of assembly and expression. And indeed it should be noted there isn't much serious support within unionism for restricting the right of assembly or expression of Irish Republicanism, so at least there is some level of consistency on that. 

Whether you think Orangeism is all about ""winding people up"" or something to do with expressing Protestantism depends on which side of the fence you're looking at it. i.e. Its a highly subjective judgement.

I'm atheist btw so its never going to float my boat. But friends are involved, and for them its all about their religion. Why else would one spend wet November evenings in a cold Orange Hall listening to some duffer give bible readings? Most banners are of a religious and scriptual nature. If it was all about winding folk up, there'd be rather more of Cromwell and Billy Wright or some such crap.

Admittedly, for the blood and thunder bands (which are distinct from the Orange Order), some of the motivations, or certainly behaviour, could be less wholesome, but the distinction needs to be drawn and an attempt at understanding made.

2) On language. Gregory Campbell makes a crass joke and you'd really think he'd personally pissed through the letter box of every Catholic to the rapturous applause of a combined meeting of the UUP-DUP-TUV. Tbh, I'm a little surprised its taken as long for some head-the-ball to make a joke in that direction before now. Sinn Fein and the DUP can rarely resist the temptation to wind each other up. Its immature politics, but EVERY parliamentary assembly suffers from it. Plenty of examples from the Dail and Westminster. Unsavoury but lets not wet the blanket over it (unless shamelessly seeking PR advantage in the culture war).

And claiming its racist? That strikes me as an underhand way to make any criticism of Irish language off limits (an Irish language school for 14 kids that even Irish language advisors told O'Dowd was unsustainable? Is it ""racist"" to be critical?)

There is such a thing as over-sensitivity. See previous comments by the rush for both sides in Northern Ireland to claim the latest ""I'm offended"" prize on offer. Its a little pathetic, and we should all learn to grow a slightly thicker skin. In normal politics it is acceptable to make a joke at someone else's expense.

Also, ""*our* language""? Can't unionists, Burmese and Poloponese use it too? Wasn't aware it was owned by a political persuasian.

*""The facts remain that colonialism is now viewed as wrong on the world stage. The partition of Ireland was undemocratic.""*

Again, a highly subjective assessment. One might argue colonialism was practised in Ireland several centuries ago, but in the present day? Really? Do you get all your news from An Phoblacht? Last time I looked Northern Ireland was a full(ish) democracy (barring our lack of opposition), a social democracy at that, with London taxpayers shelling out for one of the most state reliant parts of Europe. If we want to talk about who is exploiting who in Northern Ireland, I don't think its the benefit collecting, free health service using, free water drinking, free education using, social housing using, sinn fein voting 'oppressed' of West Belfast who can really credibly claim the victim mantle anymore. And definitely not in a global or European context.

Partition was entirely democratic if you look at it from the self-determination side of the telescope (ala Kosovo, East Timor, Crimea, Kaliningrad, Montenegro,  etc.) Furthermore don't Sinn Fein types emphasise solidarity with the secessionist movements of the Basque Country and Catalonia? What is that then but a chunk of a country saying *'forget this for a bag of spanners, we don't want to be part of the same political settlement as the geographic landmass that surrounds us, we're different'*). Is it that so different in principle?

*The native population...*

Who's the native population? Those who can claim celtic ancestry to 500 BC? Those who can claim neolithic ancestries before the celts came across the sea and cruelly colonised and destroyed the culture of the pre-existing peoples? What makes someone whose ancestors came here 400 years ago ""less Irish"" than someone whose ancestors came to Ireland 800 years ago? And by that scale, are the children of immigrants whose parents came here in the 1960s even less Irish?

Or are you denoting ""true Irishness"" with affiliation and support for your own political viewpoint?

(USA citizenry would be pretty fucked on that kind of native-invader assessment)

*""That population came here on a mission to systematically wipe out the native culture. I cant forget that...""*

You're older than I imagined, and what an incredible personal memory.

(Or are you bearing the historic grudges you imagine your parents parents parents parents parents parents parents would like you to bear? Personally I'd be pretty pissed if my grandchildren were still moaning about the injustice of the troubles. I'd sincerely hope they had moved on and were concerning themselves with more useful and productive things)

*""neither can anyone who has done any research regarding Irish history""*

Roy Foster, Paul Bew and Conor Cruise O'Brien all seem to be able to, and they're globally respected and high-selling academic Irish historians.

*""Taking everything into account a UI is the honorable outcome, the right outcome, the inevitable outcome and the only outcome.""*

Ok, while you're a respectful enough person to discourse with (you've kindly refrained from issuing personal insults as some Queens film students like to do on this subreddit - possibly a defence mechanism when he's feeling on shaky ground), the above is a highly ideological response (""the only outcome"").

The gay man is on edge as he is eager to get this moment right. This is the chance he has been waiting for so long. A lot is riding on this moment

""Gay culture is all about objectification and debauchery, and everyone goes along for the ride because they're sex crazed degenerates""

Gasps fill the room. ""I knew it!"", some cry in glee. Finally a gay man confirms what they had always known to be true.

""There is no culture in gay culture"", he continues.

""Its all about sex, drugs and clubbing. There are no gay academics. There are no gay artists. There are no gay innovators, inventors, intellects or introverts. Stephen Fry? Liberace? Alan Turing? Da Vinci? Don't be fooled by their utterly sexless masks and phoney mundanity"", he says. ""All they do is objectify and fist each other on ketamine"" 


A low murmer slithers around the room. They are very impressed with this gay man, he's not like the others. He's clearly one of the good ones.

""But fear not! I am one of the good ones!"" he bellows with a triumphant cheer. ""I have risen above this treacherous gay culture, I have elevated myself above the mindless sheep who all blindly follow the same path of objectification and shallow superficiality, and I have become a normal person, who does normal things, and wears normal clothes, just like you."" 

The crowd erupts in applause and rockets to their feet. Cheers and screams of admiration and respect fill the room. ""He's one of the good ones!"" ""I'm so impressed by how different he is to other gay people!"" ""I like how he validates my prejudices about gay culture!"" ""His opinions on gay pride and flamboyant gay people are basically ours word for word!"" 

The crowd storms the stage and in one swoop they lift him off his feet and onto their collective, very impressed shoulders. 

""One of us! One of us! One of us!"" they chant as they carry him to join them in their usual, respectable, majority group activities of polo and haberdashery, and his eyes fill with tears as he thinks ""At last, I am home""

Regarding Tesco's ""huge greed"", sorry nope. Retail has razor-slim margins, and Tesco is competing with every international store, so they cannot afford to be more expensive than the competition. Regarding local shops not being able to compete, well that's good for the consumer. If you still run a general retail store as a local store, you're not an enrichment to the neighbourhood, you're a moron. There are plenty of ways to sell food without competing with Tesco- e.g. that salad store that caters to upscale bio foods, or that Italian store that has many products that Tesco does not have. Again, that is GOOD for the consumer, as it increases your choice. In ""merry old England"", you could buy what your local store decided to offer, at their prices. If you didn't like it, well drive to the next village. How is that better for anyone? Hint: It isn't.

(This isn't about whether or not I agree with privatisation, it's about the lies.)

Schools have lost a [large number of teachers in the last 7 years](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/schools-shock-4000-teachers-lost-3729523), along with class sizes growing. Free tuition has not made a difference to those sections of society that need it most - we're not seeing the numbers from target sections of the population increasing in meaningful numbers, essentially meaning that the money is wasted when it could quite easily be spent on necessary infrastructure upgrades - dunno about you, but the street I live on (and the surrounding areas) are in a really shoddy condition.

The ""red herring"" of underspend is not so much a red herring as you'd think - why are the SNP complaining that Scotland is underfunded by Westminster's block grant if they're not spending all of what they're given? That's what I'm getting at, not the amount of underspend. It's the two-faced cheek of misrepresenting the reality of the situation to fool voters into supporting them, whilst their own figures show the opposite. A side note on the budget, there is also the case of their cries of ""we will fix poverty"" and that missing [£1 billion](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/billion-pounds-cash-to-fight-poverty-disappears-1-3159791).

As for the named person scheme, I'm of the opinion that the government should NOT, under any circumstances, have anyone in an official capacity, knowing things about children before the parents. (CPS is another matter, I don't disagree with children being protected, I just don't think that wasting resources which could be spent on improving classroom conditions is a good idea). They also want to construct an all encompassing database of personal information on everyone in Scotland. That's not their business, their business is to govern, not to infringe upon liberties. Unfortunately Labour didn't exactly shoot down NP, but a fair chunk of their supporters oppose it - I'm yet to speak to an SNP supporter who doesn't - maybe I'm speaking to the wrong ones, I won't rule out that possibility.

I'm not voting Labour for increased liberty, that's a total straw man argument there, I never made that case. What I said was that I'm voting Labour because in my constituency it's them or the SNP - as I mentioned, those are the only realistic choices that I have. I don't even have a LibDem candidate to root for :(

I know that Scotland (hell, even the wider UK) will likely never (at least in my lifetime) have a feasible amount of support for a truly Libertarian party, which would be my ideal outcome - for some reason people don't even give you the time of day, and as soon as they hear ""lib..."", that's it, you've lost them.

---
&gt;
&gt;At ""every point in history"", all stars in the universe had gone supernova due to the unique circumstances of the TARDIS' destruction in 2010. The entire universe was destroyed and erased from existence except for the Earth and its Moon. The TARDIS' continuing explosion throughout all of history acted as a replacement for the Sun, keeping humanity alive.
&gt;When the Pandorica opened in 1996, it contained billions of atoms from the universe as it should have been. Some of these were the final traces of whole races un-made by the cracks in the universe. As ""the perfect prison"", the Pandorica was also designed to emit a restoration field to preserve or restore whatever was inside it. This combination of pre-collapse atoms and the restoration field had a restorative effect on a fossilised Dalek. This seemed impossible, because the Daleks had never existed, having been wiped from history; there should have been nothing to resurrect. The Eleventh Doctor thus reasoned that if the restoration field could be transmitted throughout all of space and time, the entirety of the former universe could be extrapolated from the atoms within the Pandorica.
&gt;The Doctor used a vortex manipulator to fly the Pandorica directly into the heart of the TARDIS' eternal explosion. Since the TARDIS was exploding at all points in history, the particles and restoration field were present at every point in time. A new universe was created based on the old one, but with the Doctor having never existed. ""Rebooting"" the universe caused this new universe to proceed undamaged, because the TARDIS had not exploded. Thanks to the ability the crack in her room had given her to restore things erased by remembering them, in 2010, Amy Pond brought back, at least her parents and fiancé Rory, and at Rory's and her wedding, the Doctor after she focused on remembering him.

just a quick update question on this, if you can help me.

I have just recently got the santander 123 account and I set up 1 direct debit to pay my bank of scotland credit card. I also applied for a santander credit card to make up the second direct debit on the account.

The only direct debit listed in the ""direct debit"" section of my online banking is the bank of scotland credit card.

When I go into the section about my santander credit card, it says a minimum payment direct debit has been set up, but it's not listed in my direct debit list.

Does anyone know if this will qualify me for the interest?

null,false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt;The idea that there are two major body types is already an absurd over-simplification

There are as many body types as there are people on this planet, but we don't design cloths for each individual, we design them to fit groups of people (unless you go to a tailor or seamstress). This necessitates us simplifying and generalising on shapes and sizes. 

&gt;Trousers are already sold with a waist and a length measurement, and people can use these numbers to find pairs appropriate for them.

The reason they are sold with just these measurements is because things like the waist to hip and hip to leg length ratios are vastly different in men and women, and so need a very different cut. You could add an extra few measurements like hip size, thigh circumference, calf circumference, ect, but then you would have to manufacture 100 different sizes for each piece, instead of just 8 or 10. And those sizes would still not fit people any better, because a man with a 28 inch waist and 30 inch legs and 34 inch hips is still not going to fit in jeans in the same way as a woman with those measurements, there are just too many differences. 

It has nothing to do with equality, it is simply a matter of the practicalities of creating these cloths.

&gt;Women tend to have broader chests than men, for obvious reasons, so they can choose a t-shirt with a broader chest measurement, and so on.

But again a woman with a 38 inch chest is probably going to need a t-shirt with a much smaller waist and shoulders than a man with a 38 inch chest, so you still need to make at least two, for the man body shape and the woman’s body shape, otherwise they will not fit in the same way.

Our best combination for winning games is Pearce/Cooper (28.57143 win%)

Whilst having the best win%, Pearce/Cooper also have the worst loss% (57.14). They've only drawn 1 of 7 games, B/C is 3 in 8 draws and B/P is 4 in 11.

So in short, Cellino, Redfearn, the players, the fans and even the statistics don't know what our best centre back combination is.

Didn't Torres score a brace against the (arguably) best team in the world not too long ago?  

Come on, find a better example than that.  Torres has scored in many big games - even at Chelsea.  

As for Balo, yes he didn't start every game for Inter, but he was still very good for them, especially at his age.  He was good at City.  He rescued AC Milan in the midst of a very poor season, helping them finish the league 3rd.  He was Italy's best player when they finished runners up in the Euro Cup (speaking of shitty strikers - both Balo and Torres were tied for top goal scorer of the tournament).  

Both are strikers that can produce goals from nothing.  Anyhow, this is obviously fruitless because we've been spoiled by a few good players who score an absurd amount of goals, but then again, Ronaldo plays with Bale, Benzema, and a bunch of other players who would be the star of just about any team they play on (and likewise, Messi plays with Suarez and Neymar).

Both of those apply to you.  You can't be done for A because the blade is small.  But you can be done for B, because there's no limit on what kind of item (or length of blade) counts as an offensive weapon.

This is like, if you're driving dangerously but you're under the speed limit, the fact that you're under the speed limit does not mean you can't be done for the dangerous driving.  Similarly your knife may be ""under the limit"", but that doesn't mean you can't be done for it being an offensive weapon.

Whether it is an offensive weapon or not is of course subjective, you're saying it's not, a copper might say it is, but that's a whole separate issue from the length.",null,0,null,1422472398,null,0,false,0,co3s23s,null,t3_2tvecn,null,t1_co3s23s,null,t1_co3ml3o,null,null,null,1424340441,null,3,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,3,null

Are the lights on the small bike much good? Are you wearing visible gear? Not seeing you is no excuse for bad driving, obviously.

I know these shouldn't be things you have to do to stop others being dicks, and i'm **not** blaming you for the situation, but we all know as vulnerable road users that you can be both be right/not at fault **and** dead.

I could never ride in London, and i'd do as much as i could to avoid it. I guess living in a non-major city has some advantages. It just seems way too much, to risky, too many people on tight roads and it's only going to get worse because we can't just make more road, sadly.

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"he was tied for 11th in the league in assists, 2 of which were on the same team as us. gerrard was the guy pulling the strings last year from midfield, suarez was our creator in chief, coutinho was 21...7 assists is pretty big number for a 21 year old who didn't 'hit form' until basically february. 

and i have to disagree, you can absolutely say that because he doesn't have a world class striker in front of him, he wouldn't thrive. look at the top of the charts right now, for assists and tell me what they all have in common:

cesc = costa
gylfi = bony 
baines = lukaku/naismith
tadic = pelle 

having someone like sturridge will not only help him up his assists numbers, but it creates space for coutinho to operate. what sturridge does so well, isn't quantified easily by numbers. Sturridge not only scores goals, but is one of the best i've seen in a while at being able to drag defenders with him as he makes runs. that is why coutinho will thrive...more time on the ball = better decisions. 

and im sorry, but im pretty sure everyone on this sub has had the balls to call him out on his finishing. could he finish, we would have won both legs of the league cup, or at least the first leg. his decision making in the box isn't at the level of a messi, suarez or even someone like sturridge, sure i'll give you that, but he's only 22. i personally can't justify you saying that he won't thrive with a world class striker in the ranks based on those arguments. coutinho thrived immediately after he moved to liverpool when it was pretty much just him and sturridge at the end, and he had a great year last year as a #8, not a #10 or #9 or #7 for that matter. 

anyways i think what we both can agree on, i hope at least, is that coutinho is a great player for 22, he has been improving drastically since arriving and if he can develop his game inside the final third, we may have a world class player on our hands in a year or 2's time.

How i see it as a whole, is that an ethical business should make money, that money is then used back into a community should it be national or local. Instead they do things like evade tax, fake sales so that people buy into stocks (i think? something along those lines), and that the higher ups earn a huge payout whilst the actual workers get zilch. They claim things like making jobs, but the whole purpose of their business is built on a corporate idea: use as little money as possible and milk as much money as you can by the end. Sure this is a basic idea, but the problem is the ethical side of the idea and what people will do to obtain it.

Saying all this, there will always be a divide of opinion, and that's what helps everything move forward as a whole, if everyone agreed on one idealogy we'd never advance.

How much is enforceable in the courts? Well there's the question. You *could* go to law school to find out - but even then you will learn that he who has the most money can drive the other to bankruptcy just with legal fees battling an issue in the courts.

If you really don't want to take the risk I advise to request a change to your contract along the lines of defining ""Works and Inventions"" to be those undertaken in the normal course of your work.

If your contract won't discuss the normal course of your work then you're going to have to make a hard choice: develop your own intellectual property and cross your fingers that nobody will challenge it, or become a contractor and only choose contracts that have clearly defined clauses allowing you to do other work so long as it doesn't interfere with your contract.

Ultimately all of us just run a gauntlet of hoping nobody comes to claim what we do on the side. I know that's what I've done in the past.

Sorry there's no clear answer. It's a murky, nasty, political world out there. One where the Apples bully their way with inferior technology, lobbying, and legal action.

And that's why it always such a pleasure to have discussion with you. Its that unique level of sophistication you bring that only an arts degree at Queens could allow us all to benefit from.

If all of the above was the point you were trying to make, can I ask why didn't you make it in your original post? Or is ""enigmatic"" your middle name?

In any case, you're responding to a question noone asked (""Is NATO a prominent issue?""). The original question asked was would rejoining the commonwealth be helpful to unionists in coming to terms with a united ireland (look above and I promise you'll see it). I answered yes, and mused on some other issues that could help unionism feel they weren't waking up in Gerry Adam's faithfully-recreated European Cuba.

I've stated the consistent voting record of Northern Ireland MPs (or at least those that choose to turn up for work) in favour of NATO, and can add to that [statements this week](http://www.mydup.com/news/article/pm-ducks-out-of-defence-spending-commitment) from the DUP's Foreign Affairs spokesperson and [the UUP's last General Election manifesto](http://uup.org/assets/images/featured/Vote%20for%20Change.pdf) to corroborate my contention that NATO membership is something that would help unionists live with and feel more comfortable with the concept of a united Ireland.

Perhaps you would like to back up your argument opposing that viewpoint with some evidence of your own? An opinion poll perhaps? Or maybe a statement from a unionist party saying they don't care about NATO?

null,false,ahoneybadger3,null,null,null,"I kind of got bummed out with Reed Accountancy for a while. I've worked in payroll for 5 years so a few recruitment agencies liked to have me on their books and every other week I'd get a phone call regarding it.

It mostly went like this;

""Hi Mr Badger, we have a position come up in Sheffield (even though I live in Newcastle) to cover maternity leave in a busy payroll office.. What's the minimum you'd take to consider it?""

At this point I'd let them know that I couldn't really just come up with a figure without knowing more about the job, about the live-in status and when it is they'd want me.

So they'd come back at me with a ball park figure of around £16 an hour, accommodation paid for and even on a few occasions had the payroll manager themselves get in touch with me so I could talk it through a bit more.

On no less than 3 occasions the recruitment agency then got back to me and told me to buy my train tickets for an interview on such and such a date (generally giving me around 8/9 days notice). 2/3 days before my scheduled appointment they'd always phone and let me know that the position had already been filled and they'd keep me on their books. Luckily after the first time it happened I just didn't bother prebooking by train tickets at all.

null,false,seandalai,,Co.Cavan,null,"I'm not getting into the Orange debate it's been done to death. They are anti-catholic, triumphalist and bigoted as are their marches. However I think this marching tradition suffers because it has become a battlefront and that is down to the orange men themselves. 

The language act was also referred to as toilet paper by the DUP but that isn't the point. A nations language is part of it's identity and as we lost our language due to it's stamping out by an invasive population we feel a strong attachment to it. We see it as vital to our identity. The people who make it difficult to promote are also the body that sought to eradicate it. Settlers during the plantation were supposed to be English speaking. 

The colonization of Ulster was intended to subdue the native population for geopolitical reasons. It was a disaster and has caused nothing but suffering from the day of it's inception to this. There where Scots-Irish long before the plantation and that would be fine if it wasn't for the attempt to replace a culture in a cold fashion by elitists in England who implemented an imperialist mentality among those planted here. The plantation displaced, starved and oppressed the people of Ireland it was a crime how can you argue against that ?

Partition was totally undemocratic and the situation was unique to Ireland. Comparisons with other countries in different time periods do not apply. The people of Ireland did not vote for partition it was a decision made by Westminster. 


The native population came here in the Mesolitic period. They then developed into the Neolitic population. The beaker tradition has it's own  Irish twist as does the Bronze age implements however there does seem to be an elitist population  at this point. There never was a Celtic invasion. In fact we have very little evidence for any settlement during the Iron age never mind an invasion. Of coarse there have been bands of immigrants and settlers who contribute to the Irish culture throughout history. The difference between that reality of life and the plantation is that it was systematic and engineered to subdue a people and replace their culture. The suffering and oppression of my ancestors is a little upsetting to me and I feel like we were denied religious liberty and our chance to develop.

People who are descendants of the plantation are a separate group in their outlook on identity only.

if you get in to a business like Tesco and actually make an effort there are a lot of opportunities. from this position there are not any instant nicely paid jobs but clearly there are thousands of roles that are possible to develop into.

I asked did you think fleggers give a fuck about NATO, you responded by talking about unionist MPs. I am talking about east belfast, city hall saturday fleggers. Even middle class unionists *and* nationalists widely could not give one single fuck about NATO. But yeah, you just answer the question I didn't actually ask and then say that I'm doing it too.

Guess what, homophobic viewpoints from unionist parties are probably not something that unionist voters want in the party - but hey, thats how tribal voting goes.

Go you on down to the Shankill and ask the folks there about NATOs deployments around Ukraine and eastern Europe - see if they have any nuanced opinions or actually know what the fuck you're talking about. It goes for West, North, and South Belfast here too. NATO is a non-issue.

&gt;Some kind of concrete promises about the future they're embarking on. So far they've proved to not do much different than the establishment.  

What are you talking about, they've promised to stand up to the european elite (the troika) that's the whole point in their platform!

&gt;In a dramatic start to his tenure in office, Greece’s new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has begun unpicking the deeply unpopular austerity policies underpinning the debt-stricken country’s bailout programme.

&gt;After storming to power on Sunday, the leftwinger said there was no time to waste.  

&gt;Earlier, the energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, called a halt to the privatisation programme that the EU and IMF have demanded in exchange for the €240bn in aid keeping Greece afloat. Plans to sell off the country’s dominant power corporation, PPC, were to be frozen with immediate effect.

&gt;Dismantling the EU-IMF mandated measures that had plunged Greece into poverty and despair would, declared Panos Skourletis, the labour minister, be his single greatest priority

&gt;“We have come to radically change the way in which the country is administered,” he said, warning government ministers against the perils of becoming arrogant in power.

&gt;“We come with certain rules and regulations to put an end to the regime of entanglement [corruption] and to make the clientelist state a thing of the past. The power that has been granted to us, doesn’t belong to us. It belongs to those who gave it to us to handle.”

Less than the average life time versus thousands of years ago, think it is a bit hyperbole.

&gt; So Austria then?
Let's not forget Thailand, oh and Finland of course. You could argue that Iraq has paid enough.

Axis powers. Germany, Japan, Italy. Affiliate states shouldn't be on the receiving end of any reparation. 

Finland only fought the Soviet Union if I remember correctly, after the Soviet Union invaded Finland - I don't really class that as Nazi-Germany activity however much it aided them.

&gt; Why don't the English and the Welsh demand reparations from the Irish for the raiding parties and subsequent slavery?

I think the lesson from Northern Ireland is that Greece would be **ill-advised** to follow our example of never letting go of perceived past wrongs.

And to bring it back to the point, that's why you can slag off the amateurishness of the Greens and the opportunism of the populists as much as you like, but I'm still going to like them more than the dead-eyed neoliberal sharks who might be able to keep their political ducks in a row better because they've been properly schooled in it, but are infinitely more dangerous to ordinary people around the world.",null,0,null,1422477063,null,0,1422477445,0,co3v65s,null,t3_2tz68v,null,t1_co3v65s,null,t1_co3unz6,null,null,null,1424338919,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

The van incident was the deciding factor because he could have put me down without touching me and driven off without a care and I'd have been massively out of pocket by not being able to prove it wasn't my fault.

I don't know if driving standards are getting worse, or if I notice it more since learning to ride, but during my brief journey to work I can pick out incident after incident across the whole spectrum from sheer inattentiveness to outright lunacy. Running lights, cutting corners, driving with no lights in shit visibility, zero lane discipline, on the phone, texting, I think I have at least one example of all of these (of them, not me) downloaded from the cameras.

I'm sure it's a case of 'when' not 'if' I will need to use video as evidence following an incident so I'd advise everyone to drive or ride with one.

Well you see, democracy works by a process under which the people elect their MPs and politicians, and then the politicians they elect discuss and negotiate on their behalf. In fact its been in operation as a system in both Ireland and the UK for a good few hundred years now. Dublin-man Edmund Burke once wrote a good speech about it in 1774 in fact. So that's why, when it comes to any eventual realisation of a united Ireland, the opinion of the elected politicians of the pro-union Irish might, you know, be important.

All so called 'communist' countries skipped capitalism and went straight from Feudal -&gt; Communist societies. 

p.s I'm voting Lib Dem or Green.

what i do know, and i'm currently embroiled in a battle with a guy on another thread about this, is that coutinho will thrive with sturridge back, the team most likely will. even if he's not scoring he is dangerous and creating space, which is just as valuable sometimes. coutinho is gonna have more time on the ball b/c more defenders are gonna be committed to raheem and ds15. if two are following sturridge everywhere he goes and at least 1 (maybe two) are following raheem, then that's gonna leave incredible amounts of space in behind for coutinho, stevie, lallana, marko, whoever is playing. i have never been more excited for an individual to come back than daniel, i think he is truly a huge miss for us this season. i mean think back to all the games where we drew 0-0 or 1-1 and got into dangerous positions. i think with that extra bit of inventiveness from daniel, we would have turned 2 of those draws into wins which would put as 1 point behind united. anyways heres to hoping we win 16 straight and win t he league :)",null,0,null,1422478885,null,0,false,0,co3wdyp,null,t3_2tyy8e,null,t1_co3wdyp,null,t1_co3vxg4,null,null,null,1424338350,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

DUP - 9,345

SNP - 8,328

PC - 4,134

UKIP - 1,647

Green - 855

Those are for the 2010 general election.

Looking into it though the SNP is the odd one out of the regional parties. Both DUP / PC got pretty similar numbers of votes in their devolved elections 1 year later.

The SNP however went from 491,000 in the GE to 900,000 in Holyrood.

*If* the SNP were to get 900,000 votes in a general election across all Scottish seats the above figure would change to 15,254 which is higher than the LibDems (10,833) and Labour (13,639) with the Tories coming in at (16,963)",null,0,null,1422479164,null,0,false,0,co3wklv,null,t3_2tzdup,null,t1_co3wklv,null,t1_co3pocz,null,null,null,1424338264,null,4,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,4,null

I'm (technically) a professional VO (I use this very loosely it means I've been paid to do it a couple of times in the past).

VO Acting / Artist is like any form of acting and is very hard to get into and even harder to establish yourself, there are lots more of us than you think and the harsh reality is it's more frustrating than you think too, do want to say a phrase 50 times because you're struggling to pronounce a German cityname? Well shit the clients not happy with that so you gotta do it 50 more times!  

Other things to consider: do you have recording equipment? Do you have a showreel? Or at least samples of your work? Have you got editing software? Where are you wanting to go with this? Is it a bit of fun or a potential career?  

I could go on with these questions, educating yourself is a brilliant first step, I'm still learning now and due to taking some time off (very busy 3-4 months of late) I will need to sit and record samples and get my voice back to how it was (it's a muscle like any other).

Check out /r/recordthis and /r/voiceacting these are brilliant subs to start with, RT will potentially get you work, first off I would try doing free gigs. But aim for the paid stuff, I'm prepping to do a gig for a charity for free soon for example, it's really fun and will get me some exposure, but don't let people take you for granted.

If an animal is panicked before being killed the adrenaline is pumped through the body and ruins the meat. I.e if the animal suffered, the meat is spoiled. There is no market for bad meat. There is a huge difference, between a duck farmed for foie gras, and the slaughter of pigs, cows and deer.   

However, I think you'll agree with me that not enough people know where their meat comes from, and don't consider that it was a living, breathing animal. 

For a lot of people they only see it in packets, and see a difference between ""meat"" and ""flesh"". I think if people were more educated in the matter, firstly there would be a lot more respect for the animals that they are eating, and the lives that they had. And secondly, it would challenge a lot more people to make the decision weather or not they feel that they are comfortable with eating meat.

There is nothing sexist about it, this is a TV show, and the show has developed to the point where the Doctor is a male, and primarily has female companions (I can't think of one male companion who has &gt;= 50% ""importance"" over the female companion, let alone a solo male companion.)

It is a ROLE, it's not like saying ""Okay, a woman can not be prime minister / president / gov't official,"" this is a TV show. Sure the idea that there CAN be gender swapping time lords is fine, but it just can't happen to the main character. Anyone using the argument ""HE CAN CHANGE BODIES, JAMES BOND CAN'T"" to refute the ""Jane Bond,"" argument, is not very logical. The show is not real life, the show is a TV show. The role never does a complete change like that, it might be tweaked but it is nothing major.

One more thing, lots of people call for a female doctor just to be PC or to be ""progressive."" How many of them would be fine with an American Doctor? Most would probably say it's a British TV show, so there can't be one. Hypocritical.

TL;DR: It is a TV show, not real life, it is a male role, and there is nothing sexist about that.

SIDE NOTE: I never considered what Davison said, very interesting though. If you keep the personalities, people would complain about gender stereotyping, strong male and issues come from the female Doctor? Backlash. And if you have a weak male and a strong female Doctor? Still backlash for having a ""feminist agenda.""",null,0,null,1422479886,null,0,false,0,co3x21j,null,t3_2tzz2a,null,t1_co3x21j,null,t3_2tzz2a,null,null,null,1424338038,null,25,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,25,null

*""I've never 'seen' any unionist"". Try to use the correct tense. Even if you think it a 'colonial' language, English remains the primary language this subreddit converses in. Try to use in a way that people will easily understand your meaning.

Not familiar with Burke's Bristol speech then? I'd hate to suggest you might have over-gorged on Irish republican history at the expense of a broader view, but you know...

Condensed the concept is, it would be dangerous for politicians to be slaves to mobbish opinion. They have a duty to exercise power in the general interest and allow their own informed perception of matters to provide a guide in doing so, rather than referring all decision-making back to the ephemeral whims of a broad-brush imagination of what it is conceived electors may desire on each issue of the day.

Summed up fairly neatly in one part of the speech: ""Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion""

Anyway, most non-populist politicians have subsequently taken this as license to execute their own faculties in the course of their day-to-day business rather than blow with the endlessly changing wind of what is imagined to be popular opinion.

Again, why, when it comes to any hypothetical united ireland scenario, the opinions of fleggers (a minority of a minority) would not be the ruling issue. The opinion of the elected negotiaters would count for more.

But like my previous experience of trying to discuss the idea that race is merely a constructed concept (and therefore trying to land an authoritative claim that making a joke about the irish language is racist is a little flawed), I imagine this one is going to get nowhere with you fast.

Shove it up your hole you prick. You understood what I said yet I've had to ask you several times for you to answer. English is the language in the subreddit, that's correct - so answer questions asked of you in English you understand, when asked.

&gt; Not familiar with Burke's Bristol speech then? I'd hate to suggest you might have over-gorged on Irish republican history at the expense of a broader view, but you know...

Not an answer to a question I asked.

&gt; Condensed the concept is, it would be dangerous for politicians to be slaves to mobbish opinion. They have a duty to exercise the power in the general interest and allow their own perception of matters to provide a guide in doing so, rather than referring all decision-making back to the ephemeral whims of a broad-brush of electors.

Not an answer to a question I asked.

&gt; Summed up fairly neatly in one part of the speech: ""Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion""

Not an answer to a question I asked.

&gt; Anyway, most non-populist politicians have subsequently taken this as license to execute their own faculties in the course of their day-to-day business rather than blow with the endlessly changing wind of what is imagined to be popular opinion.

Not an answer to a question I asked.

Actually, it does. It performs as benchmarks and synthetics said it would. Benchmarks showed Maxwell as having a large advantage at 1080/1440p, but losing some of that advantage at higher resolutions. This isn't unique to the 970, the 980 shows the same differences as well.

Additionally the extra advertised ROPs wouldn't have been meaningful anyway - the bottleneck is not the ROPs, and even NOW the chip has 2 ROPs it can't utilise properly.

The end result is technically very similar to the unbalanced memory configuration used on the 660/660 Ti.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Rebtel primarily a VoIP system (so like Skype)? You need an existing local provider, even with the Access Numbers and Local Numbers system. I think you have to pay the cost of a local call to your normal operator, and then a small fee to Rebtel on top (it can be different if you have a smartphone and use the app to call over wifi, I think):

&gt; No more paying for expensive long distance with your carrier, or impractical Nights and Weekend plans that just don't work with your schedule. When you make a Rebtel call, you're dialing a local number, so you pay only for the local call to your operator, if applicable, and a very small per-minute rate to Rebtel for the international part of your phone call. If you have inclusive local minutes, the call is even cheaper! You can call anytime, anywhere, at a great rate.

* That was such a Spursy match. Exactly why I love this team: looked good, had a few ""what-if"" scenarios, started playing very lackadaisically (fuck), then churned out a winner via a VERY special player. My heart was constantly starting and stopping, and I love it.

* I think we need to start assigning match threads or something. The OP correctly pointed out that he was filling a void, but his *ahem* opinions littering the comments section (whilst not updating the actual thread) got very annoying very quickly. I don't want to slag OP off too much because again, no one did one, but someone needs to step up and do an unbiased match thread.

* ERIKSEN. That is all.

* Kane looked very selfish, but why not? He created half of the chances he wasted, and didn't offensively waste those chances, either. There were just better options. Like...

* Lamela. I really don't think he's AMAZEBALLS or anything, but he looked all right. He had good work rate, and decent passes. His first touch left something to be desired though.

* Besides those calamitous ten or so minutes, the defence was solid. Can't tell if it's because Sheffield United's attackers weren't great or what, but they were (for the most part) pretty decent.

* The Moose was loose. I hope he translates this form into the league, but who knows.

Yes, this is a fair point.

I think in a way my point is more to the religious element of it - the motivation of ISIS and Saudi Arabia when it comes to punishing people is essentially the same, I think it is an incredible act of doublethink to to be so anti-ISIS/anti-Islamic extremism while at the same time sending all of the world leaders to the funeral of a king in Saudi.

Of course the other point is that ISIS would claim they are a legitimate but unrecognised state with a legal framework in place... and honestly, I would think that legal framework would be on a par with Saudi Arabia. Barbaric. We just so happen to recognise Saudi Arabia as a nation, it's a technicality at best.

&gt;America, for instance, has a tendency to kill those who murder cops.

null,false,LinuxMage,,LibDem | EU Federalist,null,"Of course, the elephant in the room, if we chose to leave the EU, is Ireland. See, to understand the problem with Ireland, you need to read a few of the agreements we setup with the republic in the last 40 years. 

One of those agreements means we retain a completely open border to the Republic of Ireland. This is also known as the Common Travel Area. This was an agreement that Margaret Thatcher struck in 1984 as part of a larger peace and co-operation deal with the republic. Its why there is no noticeable border between Northern Ireland and the republic inside the country.  Endanger this agreement, and the Good Friday Agreement suddenly looks ropey. Endanger that, and we are back to square one with the republic re-instating its claim to the Six Counties, and Illegal Occupation by British Forces.

Now, Ireland treats its own border with the continent with some level of disregard, to say it has holes in it would be putting it lightly. For all that it matters, Ireland may as well be in the Schengen area. Basically, immigration simply switches tack to a hole *we cannot close*. Any would be immigrant simply needs to travel to Rosslare in Ireland by ferry, go by road north to Belfast, and then across the sea to Scotland. I personally witnessed this all happening already when I lived there, when I watched half a coachload of Africans use that exact route. 

We basically cannot leave the EU unless the Republic chooses to as well, and chooses to leave the Euro. That is *extremely* unlikely. If we leave the EU, people will still legally be able to travel to ireland, and come to the UK unchecked. 

We are too far in to get out now. We can leave the political tangle of the EU, but we *must* retain full EEC membership, similar to Norway. Freedom of Movement is locked in, and cannot be untangled, regardless of what the media says.

Should the transfer go through, Fiorentina could potentially re-invest the money in Atalanta midfielder Baselli, and Salah, who would be available on loan from Chelsea.

If you want to be in the midst of it all, there's plenty of student accommodation in the centre (like Phoenix Court etc etc). This is great for all the bars, clubs and social scene. But definitely check out the Gloucester Road area as it's a good balance for being close to campus and the city. Also pubs and shops on the Gloc are great.

1.  About £350-£450 month depending on where you are.  Student houses maybe slightly cheaper?
2. Compared to London, there is not loads of work in Brighton and competition is fierce so consequently wages are not high.  American Express is the city's biggest employer.  Your easiest hope of getting a job quickly would probably be call centre work.  The other big industry is tech although I think there are decent amount of charities based here or near here too.
3. You can walk almost everywhere in under half an hour.  Buses are excellent, cycling is good too but it is rather hilly.
4.  There are a few backpackers, easy to find on the internet.  Rates are around £80-90 a week for a dorm bed.

null,false,HerpesCoatedSmegma,null,null,null,"Yes but did you have interviews? Because if you did you request the feedback after and they tell you why you weren't successful. The reason they gave me for most of them was around the general theme of me lacking conviction and confidence in the interview as well as good but not brilliant ukcat/bmat scores, so they encouraged me to reapply. Contrastingly a friend of mine was rejected from Kings for conveying too much arrogance in the interview. 

If you didn't have any interviews its going to be most likely because your Gamsat score was below the threshold. Each uni publishes the lower and upper thresholds aswell as average score you needed to get an interview, it's all very transparent. If you didn't get an interview, they tell you why.

Also you were very much handicapped because of the competitiveness. When I applied second time I was competing for 1 of about 800-900 places or so from my choices of mainstream courses. You would have been competing for 1 place in probably less than 350 places because of the size of the year at those unis that take non science grads. And then you have to consider that most of that 350 will have a background in science anyway, because as far as I'm aware there has never been a med course that discriminates against science grad applicants - only courses that encourage and look slightly more favourably than others to late bloomers and non science grads. Most of the people on the course you applied to would be science people applying. 

Also I'm not sure what course you're talking about, but I'm guessing it's the ones at Nottingham and St George's. As I understand they encourage non science grads to apply, and take more than regular streams but most who are successful will still be those with a science background.

Well obviously, but you have to speak in generalisations when speaking generally. This thread is about how making clothes gender neutral would somehow change the approach men and women have to eachothers bodies... Unless we are going to discuss how this will affect every individual, we have to discuss in some general terms.

From my personal experience of both manly men, and pansy men like myself, men are much more focused on the physical characteristics of others than women are. A man will look at a ""competitor"" and say ""look at the size of his arms"", but they won't say ""look at his haircut"". They will look at a woman and say ""nice arse"" but they won't say ""and really nice shoes""... A woman is as likely to cover any possible aspect of appearance, physical as well as style, haircut etc. I do not think this is exaggeration, I have known women who are obsessed with the shoes a man wears, they say it ""tells you so much"".

This is my theory for why female clothing accentuates physical characteristics - high heels, the under discussion arse-lifting jeans, slimming underwear etc. While male clothing is less focused on this area, and more on looking ""kempt"" as opposed to unkempt. The main male physical attribute women like are visible in most clothing types - height, weight and face.

The prosecution's most obvious attack line is to show that a reasonable person (note not a drunk guy in a club the legal standard is reasonable person) would realise that she wasn't consenting (the recklessness option under mens rea).

It doesn't. If it the flag is forced onto all licences tomorrow, the only nationalists you will see/hear complain about it would be politicians, eternal yaps on twitter and uber-nationalists on reddit. You'll find that most nationalists agree that there are more important issues to be dealt with by politicians and focusing on a flag is mind bogglingly dumb.

Your point otherwise doesn't make much sense, there weren't mass protests on the street demanding the union flag came down from the city hall, it was an action taken by councillors. Don't get me wrong, there were no tears from nationalists either, maybe even a bit of triumphalism too by certain people, but it was ultimately a sideshow, not a core issue about our identity. 

The whole reason the union flag is being put on British driving licences is because there is an attempt to distance ourselves (Westminster government) from Europe symbolically. I see no reason to replace the EU flag anyway, since its ultimately an EU driving licence.

First off, Brighton is a really really lovely city :). I don't know what to say specifically, but it has a charming feel and the fact of the sea on one side.

1) Housesharing: in my experience with student houses the range goes from about £90-£130 a week, depending of course on area and quality.

2) Not sure about jobs, unfortunately...

3) Public transport is very good. The train lines run from Brighton to basically anywhere out of town East, West and North. In town, the buses run constantly and all night long. Cycling is also great, good cycle lanes, although some parts of Brighton are very hilly (not all). Driving... You can, depending on where you'll be working/living, however parking in city centre is a nightmare (that I am currently going through... I can't apply for a permit because I drive a foreign car).

4) I'm not entirely sure, but I know a friend of mine was staying at a hostel in town until she found a place and that seemed to work out quite well. :)

People complaining about politicians offering backing data for their positions. We really have lost the fucking plot now - look, I get that you don't like her or the Greens, but this is possibly the dumbest complaint I have ever seen from anyone, ever, on any topic. 

She gave high level detail, and when pressed on the low level detail suggested people check the policy document. Can you explain to me how that is complete joke?

I get your point that she had a platform to promote policy, but Neil was asking her for details which she doesn't have because they don't have a manifesto yet. Simple really.

&gt;No I'm not going to Google your fucking radical manifesto.

It's not even their manifesto, it's not fully costed, it's a policy document. Educate yourself before posting on the topic.

&gt; You tell me why I should even consider it.

To inform yourself about the detail of their policies, as any potential Green voter should. But no, you want it spoonfed. ""Oh no, reading is too difficult for me, I need all the detail right now"".

But you won't ever vote Green, so why are you even asking this? We both know you won't, you aren't their target demographic.

&gt; The arrogance and sheer stupidity of her saying that was remarkable. 

Similar to the position of you not wanting politicians to provide backing data for their policies.

&gt;You could tell she seriously upset the host with it as well

Andrew Neil is a confrontational interviewer so he is well prepared for that. He set out to unsettle her, and got an answer he didn't like. Am I meant to care that he was upset by it? Why would anyone care? This is almost as stupid a thing to write as your overall complaint is.

The funny thing is I'm not even a Green voter. I want all parties to have details online, where I can check them in my own time. I don't trust a word they say on TV, I want to check it in detail. I'm shocked you don't.

EDIT: Honest question, if she gave the detail you so desperately require in the interview, how much of it would you remember right now?

Edinburgh West - held by James Douglas Hamilton by the Tories by wafer-thin majorities for a long time, before it fell to the Lib Dems in 1997.  Labour edged ahead of the Tories for second place last time, SNP have never done better than fourth place.

Edinburgh South West - mostly made up of the old Pentlands seat, which was held by Malcolm Rifkind for the Tories until 1997.  Alastair Darling's seat now, though he's standing down - held by Labour with a comfortable majority over the Tories, with the SNP again in fourth place.

Edinburgh South - another formerly Lab/Con seat, where the Lib Dems advanced to take second place and run Labour extremely close in the last couple of elections.

Edinburgh East - another fairly safe Labour seat, though the SNP advanced to second place last time (albeit with less than half of the Labour vote).

All that said, it's worth noting that in the last Scottish Parliament elections, almost all of Edinburgh's seats fell to the SNP - Labour only managed to cling on in North and Leith, and everything else went SNP, with the SNP taking seats from Labour, Lib Dems, and Tories alike, and not always from from good places either (eg Edinburgh Southern, where they went from fourth place to first).

My questions to nitpick on a ton of other things.

1. What future (if any) do you see for pharmaceutical research in the UK following a ban on Animal Testing, since clinical trials **require** that the drug has been tested on Animals and shown to be reasonably safe? According to AR415, you do list a number of potential replacements. However, of the technologies listed, two of them would use humans and the rest of them are completely inadequate for safety testing.

2. What answer do you have to give to those who will die due to your rejection of Xenotransplantation if you are able to ban it (AR428)? 

3. Does the goal stated in CC100 have priority over human quality of life or rights? Will you protect the environment even in cases where protection requires the removal of human rights and drastic reduction in quality of life?

4. CMS206 and RR550 contradicts with your party member's campaigns against The Sun's page 3.

5. CMS611, CMS 612, CMS620, CMS 660 and CMS 662 contradict CMS206 by imposing state control over Mass Media activities, in particular increasing regulations on newspapers and journals. In particular, regulation of journals by OFCOM would stifle the sciences. What takes priority, censorship or anti-censorship?

6. CMS680 and the rest of your politics on advertising also contradict CMS206.

7. How will you implement EC658 without causing investors to abandon investing in UK Businesses?

8. EC663 states that you will implement Full-Reserve banking, despite it's effectiveness being completely unproven. Why are you willing to abandon your precautionary principle for this policy?

9. Regarding your taxation policies, you will expand corporate and capital tax, despite these being widely regarded by economists as taxes that cause the greatest amount of dead weight loss (and hence the most damage to the economy) of common forms of taxation. How do you intend to mitigate this?

10. The poor disproportionately buy environmentally unsound products due to their cheaper price. Your eco-taxes will target the poor disproportionately by increasing the costs of basic goods. How do you intend to mitigate this?

11. EC901 states that competitiveness is a zero sum game, but this contradicts parts of the theory of Comparative Advantage, where even if one country is better at everything than another country, that other country still benefits from producing in areas it's more capable at. Was an economist consulted on this?

12. How do you intend to gage the success/failure of your education policies following a reduction in standardized testing?

13. ED101 would lead to mass abandonment / demolition of existing school buildings if secondary schools are to reduce in size. In addition, the requirement of a wide range of specialists as required by ED165 and ED166 would actually benefit from larger schools which can support a wider range of specialists. How do you intend to balance these policies?

14. ED190 states that religious dietary requirements will be catered for. However, your animal rights policies suggest an opposition to practices such as Dhabihah, so how will dietary requirements be fulfilled without endorsement of slaughter methods you oppose?

15. With the abandonment of Fossil Fuel and Nuclear, there will be only a small amount of hydroelectric power available to supply the network's base load. How will you ensure that blackouts do not occur during periods of low wind, cloud or night time? Although importing from France is an option, why is it acceptable to use French nuclear power but not British nuclear power?

16. The ""Terminator Gene"" is a solution to FA711 A, B and E. Does your party have any opinions on this?

17. FA711 C is clearly a reference to Roundup Herbicide, and is based on research by widely discredited scientist Giles-Eric Séralini. Why is this part of your policy?

18. FA713 indicates complete ignorance of the scientific consensus on GM technology. Why do you ignore the scientific consensus on this yet follow it when it comes to Climate Change?

19. H326 covers regulation of medicine. Will regulations on 'natural' and 'alternative' medicine do the sound thing and implement a complete ban on both, considering these categories entirely consist of medicines which have not been proven to work?

20. PD205 states that nuclear weapons are disproportionate to any threat. Does this mean nuclear weapons are disproportionate to other nuclear weapons?

21. Have you analyzed potential threats to the UK following reduction in military strength, abandonment of NATO (PD513) and nuclear disarmament. PD302 appears to only consider threats to us in the context of our current military power, not with the level of military power you intend to bring us to.

22. How will you enforce PD400 without military threats? Dictators don't listen to pleas.

23. RR501 is redundant since that law has already been changed.

24. RR502 implies that you reject asexuality, by asserting that young people will feel either heterosexual or homosexual attraction, or both, but not neither.

25. Why did you go into the EU elections with an opposition to ITER, despite your commitment to research into new renewable sources of energy?

26. ST364 asserts that ""comprehensive assessment of the safety of GMOs with regards to the environment, biodiversity and human and animal health"" has not been done, despite it having been done. What, exactly, are your standards before you will accept that GM technology is safe?

27. As a followup question, why have you made assumptions that Organic technology is safe despite it being woefully under-evaluated due to appeal to nature? In particular, Rotenone and Copper Sulphate are two very dangerous and environmentally destructive chemicals used in Organic farming.

28. Does benign technology transfer include Golden Rice (ST370)?

Holy shit that's a long list. Perhaps I should post this on a green party forum (if there is one?) in my search for answers.

NEF express the case against quite well http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/reimagining-the-high-street

- Large stores are somewhat akin to a monoculture, if these stores get in trouble and close down you are left with a depleted high street
- Smaller local stores are often owned by people in the community, keep more people in work and can lead to more money circulating in the local community (as these businesses spend their money in the local economy)

This doesn't discount your points about cheapness or some of the benefits of big supermarkets at all, but I think they are valid reasons why people might not want Tesco on Gloucester Road.

You've really not been watching UK politics on live TV for very long then, if you think that was a bigger train wreck than Michael Howard or Chloe Smith then what are you smoking, and please send me some! 

&gt;The leader of a party proposing a radical proposal suggested people should 'google' their policy rather than explain it herself.

But that's not what actually happened, this is just the way you have chosen to describe it.

In the interview I saw, as someone who will never vote Green due to their defence &amp; energy policies, I saw her answer the question very clearly - she explained the high level policy, explained a couple of ways it could be funded and then said the remaining details will be in the manifesto, which is not yet completed. Very simple and clear answer.

Andrew Neil was not happy with this answer and wanted the detailed manifesto policies which do not yet exist, and she suggested there is plenty of information out there for people to Google on basic income if they are interested, or they could wait for the manifesto.

Can you explain to me how that was an unreasonable answer? Was she meant to invent the costings which her party has not yet completed?

&gt;The entire point she was there was to explain her policies and instead she told people to 'Google it'. And you're defending that response.

I can understand someone being opposed to the Greens, and I can understand someone thinking it was a poor interview.

It's easy even for women to fall into the trap of thinking of feminine things as less worthy. That whole ""I'm not like other girls"" thing. I fell into that when I was younger. I've never been very feminine and it's easy, in our society, to see that as being better than those who like pink and sparkles and shoe shopping.

As an educated guess, the wind provides exactly enough energy so that :
a) The wind pushes the lamppost with enough force to make it bend and absorb energy in an efficient way to spring back
b) The wind doesn't push with so much force that it bends and returns to the spot slower than it was pushed, or is even bent plastically.
c) The wind isn't so weak that the energy just goes somewhere else due to the initial resistance of the structure - air, heat (no, seriously) mechanical distortion and sound-they could be metal-screeching slightly, up close.

I started my working life at 17 years old myself working for £50 a week for 8 months at the NHS to gain an NVQ Level 2 in business administration and once I came to the end of that NVQ I was offered full time work on the full time wage for that position.

I didn't mind that at all as I was gaining a qualification that could carry over to other businesses... It was basically my equivalent to going to college as I was earning just slightly more than my mates who were getting ESA that equalled out to roughly the same. None of us really come from high earning families so that £50 a week seemed like a good compromise in regards to furthering our prospects later in life.

But this is offering none of that. This is offering only work experience in that particular field (of which you can't really carry over sandwich making to other fields). Apprenticeships should at least come with a guarantee that by the end of your contract you'll come out with a qualification that opens you up to more prospects. This is absolutely something that Subway could accommodate with an NVQ Level 2 in food and beverage counter service, but it's just not right that they're not even willing to give that. 

Just because, legally, a company *can* screw over their employees doesn't mean I'm going to give them the leeway and accept that they have taken advantage of that.

I'm not even somebody that this directly affects (I'm 28), it's just that in my time working for Subway, our owner would pay 16-17 year olds close to £5 an hour, the same as we'd pay the 18-20 year olds so I'm not buying that this is just what businesses do and letting the owners off scot free for doing so. They absolutely have the choice and if they chose to pay the absolute minimum that is legally possible and throw in some 'apprentice' title in there to do so, they should receive the same stick as these other companies have gotten that have taken advantage of the workfare program.",null,0,null,1422489028,null,0,1422490267,0,co42q4h,null,t3_2tzlok,null,t1_co42q4h,null,t1_co3vyd7,null,null,null,1424335327,null,7,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,7,null

She was candid that she didn't have the numbers. And why does she need them right now? The party are obviously discussing the details of the manifesto. She was able to give high level indicators - e.g. Basic Income would affect tax free allowance and also be partially funded by their wealth tax, but not low level breakdowns.

I honestly don't see the problem with it. Bit depressing IMO, it seems people want politicians to just make things up to satisfy them.

The FA confirms that everything is in order (Nothing is really in order), and then they hand the case over to some fuckers ""Three-person Commission""(3 fucking fairy asswipes)
The Commission’s ruling is absolute. There are no appeals allowed after a Commission has decided. And, when it comes to us you definitely know we won't get away with it.
If the Commission upholds the punishment, they then consider whether or not to increase it – If the Commission decides that the claim had no prospect of success or could be considered abuse of the system, they can add additional matches to the suspension, up to the maximum given (so, three, in standard cases).

As far as I can see, this is just shifting the burden of responsibility for 'second guessing' alleged rape victims to the judicial system, which is exactly where such action should be. A liar will be shown up in court just as well as (if not better than) in a police interview room.

null,false,meridin,null,null,null,"Warning: wall of text / arithmetic following. **TL;DR (in advance): (1)Given what you've said, if you call Sweden for four hours a month, and make more than 10 minutes of calls in the UK in that same month, you'll pay more if you use Rebtel + GiffGaff instead of just GiffGaff. (2) Consider (a) using your smartphone + Rebtel over wifi or (b) getting a Swedish SIM and using that, because of the price cap on roaming in the EU or (c) looking into the Three tariff /u/reopye_Fe opye mentioned above.**

(1) I'm not sure using Rebtel would actually save you anything much, if anything, depending on how much you use your phone to call in the UK. The following assumes that calling Rebtel is the same as calling a non-GiffGaff UK number (so 10p/minute when not included in the bundle), and your usage is as you've stated in your post (i.e. 4 hrs/month = 240 mins/month to Sweden and the £7.50 bundle is sufficient).

First, I'm not sure the 2.9p deal would work best for you, if you call for an hour a week. That's 240 minutes a month (4*60), far more than the 100 minutes a month. Either your calls aren't all an hour long, or that deal wouldn't work. That being said, let's go with that rate and with calls exactly an hour long.

Your current giffgaff goodybag gives you 200 minutes, and you call Sweden for four hours a month. That's 240 minutes, 40 minutes over your plan. You'd need £4 of credit, just to call Rebtel. Rebtel would then charge you £6.96 (240 * 2.9p). So that's £10.96, not counting the goodybag. Including the goodybag, £18.46. This leaves you with no UK minutes, but it does give you UK texts.

If you don't use Rebtel and just use GiffGaff: £7.50 (goodybag) + (4*£3) (calls to Sweden) = £19.50

The difference between those two figures is £1.04. If you make less than £1 worth of calls in the UK in the average month i.e. less than 10 minutes of calls (charged at the 10p/minute rate) you'll save money by using Rebtel. If you make more than that (remember, if you use Rebtel over the phone for Swedish calls, you'll run out of inclusive minutes), you pay more if you use Rebtel.

(2) (a) I don't know where you are when you call Sweden. If you are in your home / office and you have wifi, you could perhaps use the Rebtel app over wifi on your old phone to call Sweden, even if whoever you're calling doesn't use the Rebtel app (just call within the app as a regular phone number). You'd then pay the Rebtel fee, but no fee to GiffGaff. You could also use Skype in the same way. These options require keeping your smartphone active in the sense of charged enough to call once a week (or whatever), but you wouldn't need an active SIM in the phone, just access to wifi.

(b) You could also consider asking someone in Sweden to send you a Swedish PAYG SIM. When you use it in the UK, you'll be paying EU roaming rates. Obviously, if you use enough minutes / texts to make the GiffGaff bundle worthwhile (rather than GiffGaff non-goodybag PAYG), then this will probably cost you more (even though sending texts and making calls when roaming is probably less than the standard GiffGaff rate)

(c) I haven't looked into the Three deal /u/reopye_Fe mentioned properly, but the arithmetic for that could work out. For calling to Sweden with Rebtel: 240*(£0.03+0.029)=£14.16 per month. Whether it then worked out with respect to your UK usage and GiffGaff rates would depend on whether you'd use £5.34 or less of UK texts / calls in a month at Three's rates (3p/min, 2p/text).",null,0,null,1422489883,null,0,false,0,co437jc,null,t3_2tz23w,null,t1_co437jc,null,t1_co3zldh,null,null,null,1424335101,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

null,false,TooLeft,null,null,null,"&gt;Instead, police and prosecutors must now put a greater onus on rape suspects to demonstrate how the complainant had consented “with full capacity and freedom to do so”.

OK so this is the actual story, not really any better than the headline honestly. I really don't understand how it is possible for me to demonstrate that.

I had sex with my wife last night (honestly... I did!) and I'm not sure I would be able to convince the police she had consented if she decided to falsely accuse me to the police. How would I do so? I don't have any evidence to prove that other than my memory of it - surely the burden should be on her provide evidence against me? Am I misinterpreting the instruction? It seems I could very easily end up in court, smeared by name, where it would be easily dismissed.

Have you read their manifesto? Because they have a very sensible reason to be against nuclear, I'll paste it here:


Nuclear power is not the answer
We recognise that some environmentalists,faced with the urgent need to combat climate change, have reluctantly decided that nuclear power will have to be part of the energy mix.
We do not agree. For example:

•Sustainable Development Commission research has established that even if the UK’s existing nuclear capacity were
doubled, it would only result in an 8% cut in CO2 emissions by 2035.

•No long-term solutions to the problem of nuclear waste are yet available.

•The economics of nuclear new-build are highly uncertain, whereas wind power, for example, is now well established
and predictable. There is a clear risk that the taxpayer will have to pick up the tab.

•Nuclear is a centralised system of generation when we should be pressing ahead with micro-generation and local
distribution networks.

•A new nuclear programme gives the impression that a major technological fix is all that’s required, undermining the need
for energy efficiency.

•If we build new nuclear power stations, we cannot stop other countries doing so. This increases the risks of accidents,
radiation exposure, proliferation and terrorist attacks",null,0,null,1422490704,null,0,false,0,co43oor,null,t3_2tzzf9,null,t1_co43oor,null,t1_co3zhrp,null,null,null,1424334879,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

null,false,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,null,"Napoleon was born to French-speaking parents living in a French commune on an island that was the preferecture of the Corse-Du-Sud which made it a literal ""Department of France"" and oh he was the Emperor of France, so even if he wasn't French by birth I think it's fair to say he was a French as fucking frogs' legs by the time he died.

Besides which, if accomplishment is the measure by which we judge these men then Napoleon's accomplishments include attempting to usurp otherwise functioning nations, killing tens if not hundreds of thousands of men for the crime of daring to want to protect their homelands. All for the sake of a power-grab across an entire continent and then some.

Wellesley, by comparison, came from lower birth, had to prove himself as an Ensign in the British Army, a rank more or less equivalent to Napoleon's NCO-status of Second Lieutenant, but while Napoleon joined an Artillery Regiment, Wellesley was placed in the 73rd Regiment of Foot. Which meant our boy Arthur was closer to the blood and guts than your quivering little Frenchman.

By 1790 Napoleon was a Brigadier General at...what? 24? Thing is, he was a Brigadier General in a revolutionary republican military, and spent almost his entire military career serving in artillery. By 1790, Wellesley had served in at least three different regiments including one cavalry unit. Cavalry units, by the way? They were the guys that were expected to take the heavy losses, and Wellesley transferred to that cavalry unit. Motherfucker -asked- to be where all the danger was.

After falling in love with a woman, Wellesley was devastated to be rejected by her older brother, so he decided to go kick more ass to prove himself. The Netherlands and India became his stomping grounds, and he is credited in the battles of Assaye and Seringpatam, both of which I understand were significant in the Indian theatre. Then came home, married his sweetheart anyway and stayed faithful to her.

During this time, Napoleon got put under house arrest and decided to go invade Italy after casually rebuffing his engagement to one woman to marry another, because nothing says character like breaking off an engagement because you realised hotter women exist. That Italian campaign, by the way? Brought on by the creation of the First Coalition which only existed because of the Republican forces' successes. You know, the same forces that fed, watered and promoted Napoleon in the first place.

Sorry mate, you want to talk about accomplishment, it takes nothing to fire a very big gun at someone from a very long way away, but it takes a fuck of a lot more to want to get close enough to the enemy that you can smell their stinking breath. Arthur lived his life with loyalty, integrity and courage. Napoleon spent a disproportionate amount of time stabbing people in the back and expecting to be praised for it. For all his desires for Republicanism, he actually ended Venetian independence and subdued the Papal States, because nothing says ""Independence"" like creating an empire under yourself.

Wellesley was a brutal, bloodthirsty bastard...but at least he was honest about it.

Honestly I know the hospitals are still running but they can't even be bothered to use the correct British wallpaper that is used in all hospitals (flags and the occasional bigot boner hidden in the mix to keep it interesting). If I had a long term health problem, such as clinical depression (see [1]), which I definitely don't have because I pray to God and the DUP, but mostly the DUP, I would be genuinely afraid to get treatment for it because if I don't see a flag every ten minutes I go into a murderous rage about intolerance and injustice (against the British of course) and those foreigners dat be ruinin oor cuntry.

Still don't believe me about healthcare? Wait, there's more: if we fit everyone with 3D glasses, except not 3D but infinite dimensional because the they make people see only the colours of the British fleg, then I 100% guarantee (I swear on the DUP's God-given right to rule the country) that healthcare will improve here. Why?

1. Doctors will make more informed decisions if inspired by the Power of the Fleg
2. The Fleg will inspire increased productivity because the Great British Empire was always very productive (read a history textbook) and taught many parts of the world how they should live (i.e. not like savages)
3. If you whisper ""Flegoron, Devourer of Common Sense and Decency"" three times into a large Union Jack, a three-headed chimera will appear. Do not look away! If you look away it will sense your lack of British pride and you will suffer a fate worse than death (your brain will melt, and you will forever serve as a politician). However, if you stare it straight in the eyes, and say ""Tighter Immigration Laws"" it will open one of its mouths and Jesus will yawn from out of it and ask you what you want. If you give him a cookie he might cure your illness, but only if you seem cool and not like you'd spread sectarianism or something like that (I've never even heard that word actually until I read it out from this sacred DUP tome, I think it's ancient British for multiculturalism though).

null,false,captainxenu,null,null,null,"I've said it once, and i'll say it a million times more. The Doctor should never change into a woman. I've of the opinion that he should never change into a black man either.

The fact of the matter is that he was created as a male. A *white* male. He should stay it. If you want a strong female character, then create a new one and work at it to make it the best character it can be. Another fact is that a lot of fans would be alienated by the show just to pander to a small fraction of the audience that would like this change. 

How would people like some strong women characters be changed into men? How about Ellen Ripley from the Alien series... one of the strongest female protagonists in film history. Change her into a man and see how much everyone would chuck a gigantic hissy fit.

This just goes down to how companies try to shake things up to cater to a certain demographic just for the sake of it. A few examples recently, mainly from comics and related ilk:

* Wally West, a young redheaded white boy who is struck by lightning and gains the same powers as his uncle Barry Allen. He becomes Kid Flash and goes onto become The Flash in the 80's and one of the more popular heroes that DC Comics had... now they've rebooted and he's a little black kid. Why? Just cause.

* Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern from the 1940's. He continued to be a hero, whom also had children sired with his former enemy, and they become heroes just like him. A character with a long history... only to rebooted and changed into a gay man with no kids. Why? Just cause.

* Starbuck, a womanizing cigar smoking ace fighter pilot from Battlestar Galactica. Most likely the most liked character in the original series... only to be changed into a woman with the exact same characteristics. Why? Just cause.

* Boomer, another ace fighter pilot from Battlestar Galactica, this one a black man... only to be changed into an asian woman? Why? Just cause.

* Colonel Tigh, another strong black character from Battlestar Galactica... only to be changed into a white man. Why? Just cause.

* The Master, we all know this character... only to be changed into a woman. Why? Just cause.

Seriously, none of the above changes were made with any other reason except for racial and sexual diversity for the sake of it, because changing a character drastically is supposed to make up for the fact that the people creatively in control of these characters have no fucking clue how to engage the audience and make a new character, so they shoehorn a demographic into an old hero.

Except in the case of Battlestar Galactica, in which they went batshit crazy with change.

What did the change to The Master do to affect the dynamic between himself and his arch nemesis? Apart from the initial shock of her being The Master, nothing changed. Some people will say this is a positive because ""look, see! the master being a woman didn't change how the doctor really reacts to him/her at all""... but is it? It was written to be like that, but really... no impact on the story for such a dramatic change is pointless. It should be an underlying focus on how it affects their dynamic and their relationship with one another. The Master became a woman to fuck about with The Doctor's head... and I didn't see how it did that past the initial moment.

Why did any of the above changes need to be done? None. If you want a female hero, come up with a new one that is just as engaging as The Doctor instead of changing him into one for the sake of doing it. No storyline is worth alienating a majority of the fanbase just because.

Take the upcoming Marvel comics of Thor. In them, Thor will technically become a woman. But it has always been an established part of the character that whomever can pick up the hammer of Thor, earns the right to be Thor. Thor in the comics is powers of the god after he fucked up and was banished and his powers stripped and put into the hammer.

This isn't the first time a white man hasn't been Thor. Hell, a tiny frog has held the mantle and so to has a scary looking alien. The one thing in common is that these people/creatures are worthy enough to hold it. So a woman taking on the role (and not even for the first time, this is just the first time the mainstream media are really picking up on it) will change the comic for the foreseeable future and affect how the story is written.

But once again, this is already a well established part of the character's history. To change The Doctor and The Master into a woman is only a new thing... because they forced it on us. It feels wrong because at no point in 50 years of the characters history except in maybe the last one or two had there even been the mention that the character might be able to change gender.

I can't be fucked writing any more. This topic is stupid and shouldn't even be a topic. But people are just going to whinge about how he should be a woman, for no other reason than that it would give girls a good role model to aspire to... like being the opposite gender stops you from looking up to someone being they have a dick or a vagina unlike them.",null,0,null,1422491419,null,0,false,0,co443bo,null,t3_2tzz2a,null,t1_co443bo,null,t3_2tzz2a,null,null,null,1424334620,null,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11,null

(1) Bear in mind that with Rebtel, you have to pay for the call to Rebtel (think of it like leg A = you --&gt; Rebtel, B = Rebtel --&gt; Sweden in terms of pricing). That first leg (A) has to come out of either your inclusive minutes or credit on your normal UK SIM if you're using the Nokia phones you're looking at. I can't see that in your Sweden calculations of £47 (which is just for leg B) and you *will* go over your GiffGaff bundle if you use Rebtel unless you change the bundle.

(2) If you call Rebtel to make a call in the UK, you're paying more than you pay with just GiffGaff for the same call (because you pay A + B). If you just use GiffGaff, your call costs the same as leg A. Don't use Rebtel to call UK numbers (unless you're calling over wifi with a smartphone) - it costs you more.

The primary phenomenon here is [Von Karman Vortex shedding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_vortex_street). It is *the* classic aerodynamic phenomenon of fluid flow about an object of circular cross section. 

Essentially these vortices are being shed at a rate approximately equal to that of the resonant frequency of the pole in something of an astonishing coincidence, a unique conjugation of the right fluid velocity in relation to the poles' size both in cross section and in length. 

VK vortices of this kind will generally form the greatest effect at a particular fluid velocity that is dependent on the cylindrical diameter. The poles natural frequency is governed essentially by its stiffness which is geometrically derived from the poles height, diameter and wall thickness, although having the additional mass at the top makes it more susceptible to disturbance. 

These wind speeds are probably really high and a lot more than the designers ever thought would occur - they wouldnt (or at least, shouldnt) let these designs be made if they thought a realistic chance of this kind of fluid-dynamic coupling would occur.",null,0,null,1422494140,null,0,1422494659,0,co45n4d,null,t3_2u0ez7,null,t1_co45n4d,null,t1_co430xm,null,null,null,1424333897,null,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23,null

2: There are jobs, but not as many as you might hope. Tech support, call centres  and bar work are all common if you're willing to do any of those. As you have a vaguely Aussie accent bar work should be very easy for you ;)


3: Many bike or have cars but the public transport is generally pretty reliable. I pay £160-170 for a 90 days bus pass which works 24/7 (many of the main routes run at reduced frequency all night). If you drive parking can be a bit of a nightmare with limited space and very high charges for parking.

4: Not really sure to be honest, I've seen ads for hostels at £10-12 a night (mostly along the seafront).

White is the default culturally and socially, in the UK at least. As a non-whote person you definitely feel it. In day to day life (not making any value judgements, just saying)

2) it lumps everyone who isn't white together pretending they all share the same background and struggles.

Sometimes you need to refer to everyone who isn't white as one large group. The term BAME (Black and Asian Minority Ethnic) excludes the Americas/Latinos as well as East Asians (not all asians are the same). I also propose that ""People of colour"" is less white-defualting than other terms as it uses the diversity of race as its reference point, not whiteness.

technically this means that you could be living with an unemployed partner who has no money themselves, and then get charged for ""rape"" because ""she only consented because she needs your money and she knows if you don't receive sex you will dump her"".

if you have a partner who relies on your income, and she/he stops being sexual with you, you have every right to terminate the relationship and withdraw all your support.

to think the state can criminalise you as a rapist because your partner needs you for your money, is a fucking disgrace, you have the right to dictate what terms and conditions your love or affection has (within the law) and anyone who claims otherwise can fuck off.
