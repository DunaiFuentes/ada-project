To be honest I kinda fell into Everton on accident because of FIFA. I worked at a radio station with an old PS2 and a copy of FIFA. The sports guy and I would frequently clash over it, he was a liverpool supporter, so logically I chose their rival Everton, knowing that Tim Howard was their keeper. Then I saw Felliani's glorius Fro for the first time and decided that everton should be my EPL club.

Once Everton games started becoming regularly available in the states I started watching and absolutely fell in love with the atmosphere at Goodison Park, could imagine supporting another EPL club after seeing the place (Sacramento has since founded a very successful Third tier Club, Republic FC, which might literally be the single best thing that has ever happened to our city), but Everton will always be my first football club. 

I hope one day to make the pilgrimage to Goodison.

null,null,chrisjd,,JezWeCan,null,"&gt;  Anyone on this list will almost certainly be keen to see Corbyn dispatched as soon as possible, for obvious reasons. There's absolutely no prospect of them ""putting up with"" someone who advocates for Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas, none.

Corbyn doesn't ""advocate"" for Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas, he simply wants to involve them in discussions. How strongly Labour Friends of Israel disagrees with Corbyn depends on how strongly pro-Israel/Zionist they are. Hopefully not very, they are supposed to be representatives of the British people not the Israelis. From the wiki page it does say they support ""a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Israel recognised and secure within its borders and the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.""  which is also what Corbyn wants and can also only be achieved by talking to both sides. It also says they are ""less unquestioning in its support of the Israeli government than the Conservative Friends of Israel"". Not a single Labour MP voted against recognising Palestine as a state, even though Israel opposed it, so it doesn't look like Israel has that much sway over the party. Besides, a bunch of British politicians deposing the leader of their party because he isn't pro-Israel enough would go down pretty terribly with the British public, for this reason hopefully they won't outright lead a coup.

As for the Blairites, a lot of the names on that list strike me as more loyal/careerist politicians who don't seem like likely names to rock the boat too much. I think you underestimate how much they would tolerate Corbyn, especially if as I think the public actually quite likes him and they are proved wrong about him being ""unelectable"". They wouldn't cause trouble unless things were looking bad, I very much doubt they'd go for a day one coup especially since they wouldn't get a Blairite candidate elected in the next election either, the best they could hope for would be another moderate Miliband/Burnham type leader, Blair and Blairites aren't that popular at the moment.

YOU CANNOT BLAME NEWCASTLE'S ADVANTAGES ON OUR BOARD.  
  
Newcastle is by far the largest city in that part of the UK, competition wise the only nearby club to compete with is Sunderland in a smaller city 10 miles away. A vast area outside of newcastle allies itself with the club because they are the best established team in 150 miles.   
  
  
Conversely Everton share a city with the second most successful club the UK has ever seen this bunch of shitehawks command the vast majority of the country, let alone the city. If we expand our scope we come to manchester 30 miles away. Home to TWO of the best teams currently in the country one of which is the most successful in the country EVER and one of the biggest clubs in THE WHOLE WORLD.

He is the guy moving to space that pulls the defender a couple feet so Coutinho can feed in Ibe or offering himself for a pass so you can keep possession. In transition Hendo is vital he's always the person making the wide options viable. He isn't flashy but he's too consistent and works too hard to be dropped especially for Milner who has done fuck all in red. (Not saying he won't but he doesn't get to stroll into the team.)

Elections are won on the amount of seats gained not the total number of votes you get, UKIP gained close to 3m new voters while the Greens gained close to 1m new voters and neither of them gained any seats. It's a shit system but i can't see it being changed for 2020.

Long answer:  People only have a right to legal representation if they are being formally interviewed under caution at a police station (whether under arrest, or voluntarily).  There is no right to consult with a solicitor if they are not at a police station (PACE Code C).

Additionally, they are entitled to consult with a *solicitor*.  The PACE Codes of Practice define how the police must behave; code C defines how the police must treat people who are being detained for non-terrorism related offences.  Code C, paragraph 6.12 defines a solicitor as:

- A person holding a current practising certificate, or
- An accredited or probationary representative included on the register of representatives maintained by the Legal Aid Agency.

If you do not fit these criteria then you cannot be your friend's legal representative.

If the police officer reasonably considers that you are obstructing him (defined in case law as, essentially, making it harder for him to do his job, which is to investigate whether a crime has happened and investigate whether your friend is responsible for it), then you may be committing an offence of obstruction if you deliberately hinder the investigation.",null,0,null,1439493814,null,null,false,0,cu1x88k,null,t3_3gvs1o,null,null,null,t3_3gvs1o,null,null,null,1441231700,null,7,null,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,7,null

It's a an interesting but sensitive topic to suggest taking away someone's benefits of they refuse treatment. 

Obese people cost the NHS significantly more over the course of their lifetimes than a healthy person, and of course the cost of surgery, so it makes sense to offer these solutions from a monetary perspective. Taking away their benefits? Probably not such a good idea.

Yes but I guess that it all boils down to what sort of society you want. I appreciate the value in equality but I don't think creating the most 'equal' society is at the highest priority. But I do appreciate that too much inequality is a bad thing. 

&gt;that extra £5 didn't come without a cost, someone was cut short somewhere

Not necessarily, the economy isn't zero sum. If the economy grows then more people acquire wealth at the expense of no one. 

&gt;who decides who gets the £20, did they work harder to get it, were they born on a side of the family your aunt liked better?

Well I guess that's where this analogy falls apart. Ideally (from a capitalist point of view) the market should - however of course there are downfalls with wealth being passed through families. I can agree here that this is a downfall of capitalism. 

&gt;thats impying that GDP is the be all and end all of success, we only operate under than assumption because alls we've ever known as a modern society is capitalism being required for jobs to be done 

There are certainly times in history which show how capitalism has benefited the country. Take a look at China and how opening the markets has benefited the country; poverty was at 85% in 1981 and is down to 33.1% in 2008. 

&gt;  but when over a 3rd of population feels their job is meaningless, surely that means all the worlds problems are fixed right? no?
so rather than having 37% of people who feel their job is meaningless, **why not put them to work on problems that need fixing.**

Like what? How and who decided where you put people to work? Surely people will still be required to perform mundane tasks which feel meaningless?

&gt; Jobs that are meaningless can be automated
All of them? I'd be interested in looking more closely at this study. I can imagine that some cleaners find their job 'meaningless' which cannot be automated. 

&gt; I think countries are too obsessed with a public image of 'growth' as we describe it but the country (not the people) on track to improving numbers, trickle down doesn't work, because even when countries are successful with GDP (the U.S) there is still huge inequality in society, millions in poverty and millions without access to basic requirements such as affordable healthcare.
Yes which is why I don't think all socialist elements are bad. Socalised medicine is good and a supportive welfare state is good.

&gt;i think we are already there conservatively, 800,000 children in poverty for the next decade, on a scale, I think the country can afford to go more left than right.

[Child poverty is at it's lowest point since the 1980's](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33266799). Although don't get me wrong, I didn't support all of the tories welfare cuts I think some went too far. I would say that I'm slightly to the left of the tories (a lib dem, you could say) but I'm skeptical of moving to far left.

To answer your question; I did give it a go. I tried my hardest to go in without expectations.

But it instantly collapsed in on itself.

What happens is that they give you ""homework"" for the next session, basically. It's like guided therapy, you don't actually talk about anything. They just give you a A4 sheet of paper and explain what to do and answer any questions.

The problem is that if what they try to 'teach' you for week 1 doesn't work, you're screwed in week 2 and so on. You don't get a mulligan. You don't get to try again. You don't get to repeat a week.

If you miss a week because you feel especially depressed, or you have a personal incident **tough shit**. The process rolls on without you - then ejects you like a pilot pulling a rip cord at the end.

This is what happened to me. I stumbled in the beginning, then before I knew it we were in session 4/6 and I was getting distressed just by the rapidly declining time I had left. Ironically the deadline itself made it difficult to complete the course. If I was given unlimited time I think it might have had a chance to work.

And the worst part is my therapist agreed with me. She wanted more time with me, but she couldn't provide it. She agreed with me when I raised the points above. She was as powerless as I was.

This impacts people wanting to join Liverpool; who's going to want to join a club where their employers freeze you out because you haven't played well. Freezing out is for players that have terrible attitude issues and disrupt the locker room; not for former first team regulars that are unwanted and need to be sold on.

I think when it boils down to it, we agree, moderation is key to most things, aspects of socialism could help balance the overreach and inequality certain aspects of capitalism created, currently the system we have now isn't working in my opinion and the mentality of GDP and aquiring useless jobs for self worth is part of the problem, its an inevitability that there will be not enough jobs for people as technology advances and we should be prepared for that by accepting that the 9-5 work week (especially with certain types of jobs) are not worthwhile to society.

a lot of conservatism hinges on the pressure of ""if you work hard enough..."" but thats not the reality and in the near future won't be even obtainable for a lot of people, there needs to alternatives and if we can't create jobs (because machines are doing it for us) then pretending the only alternative is have a country of lazy people doing nothing, we can have them work toward things that benefit everyone, rather than scraping by too afford their own bills.",null,0,null,1439494818,null,null,false,0,cu1xwyx,null,t3_3gtqtr,null,null,null,t1_cu1xgb2,null,null,null,1441232024,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

So political culture is effectively a broadcast culture (people hear far, far more from central points like news print and tv than they do from other individuals). That makes it much easier for political parties to divide up the electorate, market individual messages to particular groups, and also for newspapers to pretend to represent public opinion against the actual reality. These things make it seems to most of the population that politics is completely crazy. i.e. some stupid message might appeal to particular voters in particular marginal constituencies might just annoy most of the population (albeit not enough to get them to change their vote).

As for your course, I haven't met many in those departments either. Check out the ranking. Your course is important. It's going to be your focus for 3 years. Make sure you like its content and how it's assessed. Personally I think mine being predominantly coursework at UKC helped me get a First Class degree.


Canterbury is one of my favourite towns, and it has a lot of character. It's got a shit-tonne of pubs and the music scene is actually pretty decent if you step out of your front door and get off campus. Sure, there's no big live arenas, but there's open mic nights and more and more things are coming to town, what with Wise Words, City Sound Project and the Marlowe theatre. 

The range of erasmus/year abroad opportunities are worth bearing in mind. I went to the USA and it was the best decision that I ever made.

I can't make your decision for you, and I think you'll enjoy the path whichever route you take. Canterbury is difficult to adjust to if you're from a big city; some get bored from London or Nottingham. But it's beautiful and it has character. It's very safe. Ask me anything, happy to help.

It's flat out insulting that this guy is trying to say that an arts degree is equal to a degree in a technical subject which is something that is confirmed by employers. 

This guy has seen something that is doing well, seen that universities are churning out thousands of surplus art graduates every year and tried to join the dots. Problem is the dots are already joined, and the artists with talent are being recognised. Games design doesn't need more arts graduates than it already has, and neither does any other industry in great numbers.

Realistically we need to limit people taking courses that aren't going to get them employment. Simply offering less places would increase competition and ensure that only the best and most dedicated people get through. Otherwise getting people to pay for (or some of) their tuition fees on degrees where employability is low would help put off all but the most dedicated (I don't like this solution as much though, as it doesn't impact the wealthy and may cause genuine talent to not get a fair chance).

EFC, though, didn't have the cash to build the roster for a long Europa run.

It's kind of like the difference between MLS and Liga MX teams in CONCACAF. Sure, there are a couple of players at the top of the roster who can handle the competition, but MLS rosters are SO MUCH thinner when it comes to spots 5-18 that they can't fully rotate a squad without dipping into the second division roster.

So again, do players never get better?

&gt; he may be performing well in training but I see no reason to favour him over a player who has proven he can perform for us at a high level in the league,

Again... I'm pretty sure the manager, who sees a lot more than you, is a better judge and has his own reasons. You can think they are wrong though. But if we continued with your writing people off right away we would never have players like Lucas or Henderson. Lovren might be an absolute dud, but if Rodgers puts faith in him, I think I just might as well. 

&gt; Have you ever questioning a starting lineup in your life then? You are the one being hypocritical here since I can easily point to your argument to justify literally any selection ever. 

Yes. But I don't sit there and act like I know more than the manager and they should be fired. In hindsight though I think I am being hypocritical because I don't think I was very patient with Hodgson. The difference though in my opinion is that Rodgers is a good manager and Hodgson wouldn't. But that's just cognitive dissonance on my behalf. 

&gt; Another point that could be used to argue the inclusion of so many sub par players because it is that broad and that basic.

&gt; Capitalism is attacked constantly and always and as a result it is held in check and is all the better for it over the longer term.

Bailing out the banks. Allowing poor &amp; disabled people to be victimised in the UK. Allowing the southern European states to suffer the consequences of the financial sectors criminality. Almost half the worlds population doesn't have enough to eat. Selling WMD to arseholes. Oh the list could go on. If that's called Capitalism being kept in check, I think you possibly need to think harder about what you said there. These examples I gave sound like clear demonstrations of unjustified power and outright greed by a few fucking arseholes who own most of the property and means to production.  Unfortunately we are in the cult/religion of capitalism, because you can't live a normal life without it, it's incredibly predatory.

&gt; Do you agree that it was wrong to allow the Baltic states and other former communist bloc countries into the EU?

No I don't think it's wrong. I don't really believe in nations or unjustified power personally and I think it's a great advantage to be able to live, share and work anywhere in Europe. Just because they where former 'Soviet' nations doesn't matter to me. Economically it puts a strain on richer nations in the EU sure, but that's not the individuals fault, its the fault of capitalist and nationalist ideas which allowed most of the problems to occur in the first place.

&gt; You know he wants to leave NATO and scrap trident? On a foreign policy level this would leave Germany without a massive ally in Europe.

I'm not a believer of NATO (weapons or wars), it should of been disbanded with the fall of the Soviet union, as it was only there to defend against the Soviets and the USA went back on promise which was made during the talks with Gorbachev in the late 80s/early 90s. 

I think it's great that Corbyn wants to scrap Trident, it's a mindless concept to have Nuclear weapons. Regards to Britain being a massive ally, peh, what ever. The UK government seem more interested in bombing other nations and creating future wars instead of abiding to a defensive military concept. 

I also think it's refreshing that his coming up with new ideas which contradict the the blinkered view by many today, sure his not right about everything but damn he opens the discussion up compared to the ideas of New Labour who are merely spineless slugs to the same powers who the Tories support.

There is a good reason why Labour were long referred to as ""Tory Light"", they would likely be pursuing very similar policies albeit slightly less stridently and, hopefully, hammering the poor a bit less (or less obviously). From that POV they are obviously preferable to the Tories, but the thing is they also have a proven record of shitty behaviour across the board.

 * Government appointed scientific advisor reproduces report that does not fit the party line? Fire him.
 * Minister gets himself into a public scandal and has to resign? Hire him back at the first opportunity.
 * Same guy gets himself into a position where he has to resign again? Well we hired him back once, can just do it again.
 * Willingly pour shite loads of public money into stupid public-private financing schemes that cost billions extra in the long run but make the books look good right now? Yeah lets do it repeatedly.
 * Put a selection of nutters into the Homeoffice and give them a copy of 1984 to use as a manual. (the Tories also seem to be doing this ...)
 * Abuse the majority and party whip system to the max to ensure that what Tony wants Tony gets with as little fuss as possible.

The idea that people find themselves at full moon parties full of cheap booze and red bull laced with amphetamines is, to me, ridiculous. Or that they suddenly become so worldly by hanging around with a bunch of their mates jumping around islands in Thailand or bungee jumping in New Zealand.

Some maybe do something a bit more rustic and go to Africa, but this seems mainly so they can get loads of photos of themselves with black children for facebook.  Maybe I am just overly cynical though.

Hi guys, selling a spare phone. It is locked to O2 and runs Android 2.3.6. 2GB MicroSD card included. I can hopefully find a charging cable to go with it.

Will swap for a PSP (any model), original DS, or some Game Boy games. Would love to trade the phone and add some cash for a PS Vita but that's a longshot I know.

null,null,EpicFishFingers,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,null,"A bit late to the thread, but I now work alongside various housing developers for a living, and I think I can add a bit to this.

It really does vary from developer to developer, but I'd argue that many hoses aren't copied and pasted nearly as much as they used to be. Look at an average street in North London, for example. and it's two housetypes down every street: the semi-detached housetype, and the mirrored (handed) version of the exact same house.

Housing developers nowadays have a catalogue of available housetypes from which they choose on an available site. They'll be named differently depending on the developer: Persimmon Homes, for example, use names like Souter and Alnwick, whereas others use codes like 2B/2S/NF (2 bedroom, 2 storeys, narrow face), or 1042 (1042 square feet on the interior). Anyway, the number of different housetypes depends on the developer, and I can't comment on how often new ones are created and old ones retired, as I haven't really worked in this area long enough to see new ones emerge or older designs fade out.

The repetition really shows between different sites. When working with the same developer on two different sites, I'll see at least half of the housetypes re-appear on the second site. Bespoke designs are expensive and cut profits for little gain also: structural calculations have to be re-done each time, you need to design an entire new house, to building codes, each time, and how often do you meet someone with the same housetype as you who isn't your neighbour, anyway?

The attractiveness of the housetypes won't matter if they're crammed in as tightly as possible and no parking is provided so there's cars parked all over the street, which is often the case when developers provide single-size garages and expect people to actually park cars in them rather than putting their tumble dryer and other tat in there. As an aside, as many new builds use efficient, small-member roof trusses, loft conversions are no longer possible, and in the case of attic trusses, lofts are often not available, so all the shite that builds up in families over the years will end up in this single garage, not that I need to tell you that. I'm surprised I haven't seen a garage too small to fit a car into, so far, but all have been at least 3.2m width internally, although rarely much wider than that.

The shrinking size of the houses, with living space being increasingly sacrificed for bedrooms, coupled with the mentality of ""if the garden can fit another house in it, then it's too big"" is, in my opinion, what makes new developments ugly. They're just too close together.

Another factor I believe doesn't help is how most developments only have one access route, with the roads branching out to cul-de-sacs in winding curves and few identifying features other than the houses themselves. You can rarely drive through a development and come out the other side unless the road was built before the surrounding development, meaning you spend more time around the houses, and begin to notice the ugly ones and the ones that are identical etc.

All of the things that would make new-builds more attractive are things that require development without profit in mind: less houses per square kilometre, and more living space within each house. I don't believe the variety is an issue alone, however.",null,0,null,1439499039,null,null,false,0,cu20s2p,null,t3_3gbyw3,null,null,null,t1_ctwr1cc,null,null,null,1441233437,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Actually Jeremy [acknowledged the human rights atrocities of Saddam](http://stopwar.org.uk/news/iraq-crisis-shows-it-s-time-for-uk-to-cut-free-from-us-and-nato-war-policies-says-jeremy-corbyn-mp), [warned against arming him](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11710685/jeremy-corbyn-profile.html) (and yes, that manages to pop up on an anti-Corbyn Telegraph piece!), and in 1998 said that he was [opposed to war in Iraq because it would _strengthen_ Saddam's position](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo980202/debtext/80202-08.htm) (sure, history didn't go that way, but do note that here that _the last thing he wants is Saddam to be in a better situation_)!  And that's just what I could scrape from Google, so I bet it doesn't even scratch the surface of Jeremy's opinion on Saddam.

And it's hardly as if Iraq is an absolute bed of roses now, is it?  It's _less_ stable than it was under Saddam.

When I went the maximum student loan available to me was £915 per year. This was due to my parents being over the income threshold (&gt;£54k combined I think). In order to pay for my rent and living costs at minimum wage I would have had to work beyond full time hours, which when you're already studying for a degree isn't really viable. Anyway I feel like this is straying off the topic at hand.

&gt; I'm not saying we don't help drug addicts or the chronically obese, I'm saying that cutting off the money they need to live doesn't help them in any way.

No. That's not how the ECHR works. Those are exceptions to the law that the government can use to restrict freedom of speech. It does not mean those are not protected in the absence of such laws.

&gt; in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or the rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.""

But he wasn't doing any of those.

And the ECHR doesn't apply here anyway. Freedom of speech informs Article 10. Article 10 doesn't provide it, or for that matter, do a particularly good job of protecting it. That lot would allow us to ban Wikileaks, protests near parliament, support for decriminalising cannabis, all forms of pornography and publishing of ministerial expenses claims, all without breaching freedom of speech

Name: Clinton N'Jie

Age: 21

Position: Forward

Height: 5ft 9ins

Club: Lyon – 43 games, 8 goals, 9 assists

Country: Cameroon – 11 games, 6 goals, 1 assist 
What’s his background?

N'Jie enjoyed a breakthrough 2014/15 season as the exciting, pacy forward established himself at both club and international level. 

After leaving Cameroon to join Lyon’s youth set-up in 2011, N'Jie only saw glimpses of first team football in his first three years in France under then manager Remi Garde with his debut coming as a late substitute against Reims in November 2012. A further nine appearances from the bench followed before the arrival of new coach Hubert Fournier last season coincided with N'Jie becoming a regular in the match-day squad.

A first start against Toulouse was followed in September 2014 by a maiden league goal at home to Lorient – a strike which, fittingly, came on the same day that N'Jie had signed a new contract at Lyon until 2019. 

In all he made 30 league appearances and scored seven times as Lyon finished second to Paris Saint-Germain, although he was only in the starting XI for 15 of those games. Lyon had actually led the table going into the final months of the season and N'Jie’s most notable goal came in their home clash against PSG in February, when he opened the scoring in a 1-1 draw after playing a clever-one two in the box with Nabil Fekir. 

Arguably even more impressive, however, was N'Jie’s immediate adaption to international football. Several weeks before he had scored his first goal for Lyon, the youngster had opened his account for Cameroon on his debut against the Democratic Republic of Congo in a qualifying match for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations.

Four days later and he then struck a brace in a 4-1 demolition of the Ivory Coast, the tournament’s eventual winners come February. N'Jie’s haul for Cameroon now stands at six goals in 11 games – a record which is already leading to comparisons with the country’s record goalscorer and most famous player, one Samuel Eto'o.
What would he bring?

Having passed through an academy which knows a thing or two about producing international class strikers - Karim Benzema, Frederic Kanoute and, most recently, Alexandre Lacazette to name just three - N'Jie certainly possesses the attributes required to succeed as a modern-day forward. 

While Lacazette, Ligue 1’s top scorer in 2014/15, generally operates down the middle in Fournier’s exciting side, N'Jie can play either just off the front man on either flank, with a number of his goals coming from surges into the box to meet a cross. 

Running with the ball is also a key attribute of the youngster’s game and, according to WhoScored.com, he attempted an average of 3.6 dribbles per game in Ligue 1 last season, although more were unsuccessful than not. He also averages nearly two shots per game.

Given Harry Kane scored 36 per cent of Spurs' Premier League goals in 2014/15, any arrival for N'Jie would provide much-needed additional firepower for head coach Mauricio Pochettino.",null,0,null,1439500315,null,null,false,0,cu21mal,null,t3_3gwb1h,null,null,null,t3_3gwb1h,null,null,null,1441233833,null,1,null,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

null,null,RedofPaw,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"I get both sides of the debate - I understand why there might be Labour supporters who are nervous that Corbyn will make them 'unelectable'. The problem I see is one of 'electable at all costs'. 

UKIP gained support because it embodied, for better or worse, a point of view that was not being served. Corbyn does the same. There are people who genuinely feel he is speaking ideas that are not being vocalised elsewhere - it's no surprise that he is gaining support over more 'polished' political offerings. 

The question Labour has to ask itself is why it's failed to supply what Corbyns supporters are seeking.  If 'Blairites' and other New Labour guard are scared of the genuine chance Corbyn will be their new leader - to the point they threaten mutiny - perhaps they need to look inwards and question how it got to this stage.

Ed Miliband was fine. He was alright. Not inspiring, but pretty centrist. He spoke some ideas a lot of people supported - and did pretty well, to the point where the result of the election looked in question for a long time. Yet it was not enough. It fell short. 

Maybe  the answer is to simply elect someone more charismatic. Sell the same brand Ed was selling, but simply... better? The problem is that none of the alternatives to Corbyn feel different... they don't inspire. They're... fine. They're alright. Just like Miliband.

Maybe Corbyn is a bad choice. Maybe he will actively damage the Labour party. Maybe they will lose support and the Tories will be left in an even stronger position next time.

But Labour need only look at themselves to see who is to blame. 

Perhaps, rather than implode, they accept Corbyn. They build a platform that appeals not just to the natural left supporters of Corbyn, but centrists as well. Maybe they all pull together and become stronger.

Probably not. If so then the seeds of their demise were sewn before the recent Corbyn 'surge' - and if they'd got their act together sooner then Corbyn may not have found the support he did in the first place.

In the meantime I'm interested to see what Corbyn can bring to the table. Maybe if he's the smart one here he can build the broad support of his own party.

null,null,Zmod,null,null,null,"Yeah they aren't similar players, just trying to show that players don't really hugely improve from the age of 19 ish really. I'm talking like lower Prem standard at 19 to  Mata/Hazard/Coutinho level at 23/24.

Mata was a year later, but at the age of 20 he destroyed La Liga... 11 goals 17 assists in 37 games is incredible.

Silva was still doing pretty well for Valencia and Celta when he was 19/20.. not the level he's on now of course,  his breakout season didn't come much later.. at the age of 21. 

Di Maria was the only one I've been able to find who became ""amazing"" a few years later than the rest so far.

Robben broke 10 goals in Eredivise when he was 18!  02/03 (18 years old) and 03/04 (19 years old) combined he scored 17 goals and 17 assists in 56 games, that's incredible for an 18/19 year old. Eredivise maybe a weaker league, but that's incredible and earned him  a £12m (like £20m in todays money probably) move to Chelsea at the age of 20...

Totti and Ribery sure, what I said isn't really true for older players in most cases.

Willian had a pretty good season in 08/09 when he was 20, 8 goals 12 assists in 52 apperances (only 3k mins) is really impressive but that's a weaker league. He definitely got quite a bit better though. Wouldn't call him a £30m+ player right now though, even though 2 clubs paid that for him recentlyish.

There's Ronaldo and Messi also, who I'm sure you remember were both fucking amazing and would have walked into any team in the world at the age of 19...

Every world class attacking player over the last 10 years was better than Ibe at 19/20. That's all I'm really saying. Ibe will be good, but I extremely doubt he'll be world class. Prob Lallana/Willian/Tadic kinda level, they're not world class, they're a level or 2 below. Ibe has pretty much nothing to his game except pace, strength and the ability to dribble, he can't finish, shoot and has no vision. I really don't see how he's going to improve on all of those aspects to become a world class player within 4/5 seasons but I'd love to be wrong.

I see this put out time and time again. Yet not all the people that voted tory are tories - they are floating voters.

Also there were 3M people that voted UKIP. Many of them are ex-Labour, some voting on immigration, admittedly, but some voted because they wanted something different.

Granted, this may not be enough for an election, but I don't think it will be a colossal loss as you suspect (and that Campbell &amp; Blair have warned). But again, if you look at who's there to beat then in all honesty Michael Foot's zombiefied corpse could probably do it in 2020. Cameron goes close to meltdown when properly challenged, Osborne is a borderline psychopath, May is paranoid and Johnson's shot his bolt.

If ""Anyone But Corbyn"" leads the party then they HAVE to show more oomph than what's currently on offer. So why haven't they already done so? And should they lose in 2020 then whatever your feelings are on the matter there will be an almighty backlash against the anti-Corbyn clique.

I don't know how old you are, but I'm in my forties. I'm barely old enough to remember the Callaghan government, but I know all too well what neoliberalism and Thatcherism has done for me and my family. More to the point I know what centrist policies have done for me and many former colleagues these last 10-15 years. I freely admit that I am a socialist, bordering on marxist, and I would dearly love to see the basics (such as infrastructure, policing, health) taken care of instead of cosying up to Big Corp and Big Media.

i) Vote with your conscience against the leader

ii) Vote with the leader in order to preserve party unity.

My curiosity about him is wrapped up in the idea that winger in a front 3 of a 4-3-3 or right winger in a 4-2-3-1 isn't where he will end up playing. I think he has vision, but it is only when he is playing deeper that you see it. He is the kind of player who needs to see what is going on 40 yards ahead of him when he picks up the ball. I am basing that off of watching him in youth teams, Derby, and for Liverpool at wingback. That's why I would compare him to players who clicked after positional switches. Right or even left side of a midfielder, not as a winger but a wide midfielder, that is where I think he has the potential to develop into a top top player--not Messi or Ronaldo, but, at wingback, maybe Srna or more like Asamoah, and at midfielder, maybe similar to Zanetti when he played on the right of midfield, 2008-2010 I think it was.

If it really is sexism, then the forced jump to 50% should be what is required to fix it, and from then on it would remain roughly equal naturally. If it is just down to biological differences after all, then over time it would trend down to whatever natural balance emerges. 

So hopefully bringing that in would once and for all determine how much of the imbalance is down to sexism.

I guess I did? You have heard of a joke, right?

&gt;Well, that's what Danczuk is planning to do. He's going to rebel against the leader for the sake of his conscience.

Rebel like the night of the long knives. If he only wanted to vote against policies then fine, he should, but openly stating he plans betrayal? That's like asking Corbyn if he'd like to join him outside for a rumble.

&gt;Wait - I thought you wanted people to vote with their conscience.

I do, but this isn't trying at all, as I said, to reach a consensus. This is like removing a wart. Or at least treating it as such. As I say, if Corbyn is that much of an anathema to Danczuk, then why has he (Corbyn) remained supportive generally of the party's policies throughout their tenure in government and beyond? Danczuk has gone ahead and said without thought just feeling that he's going to outright reject anything he's doing, well that's fine, but if the majority of the labour party vote for him, then is he in the right party? Is breaking something because it won't go your way what Corbyn did? He spoke out, he protested, but he didn't throw away his toys.

I mean if someone is that popular, then why not investigate why? If he's that solidly hot on the pulse of the nation, that they're generally going to love five more years of the labour party as current as opposed to Corbyn then why not have a more enquiring mind about the man.

&gt; 
&gt; ""A woman who stole the cheapest food in a store because she was hungry and had no money was told by a magistrate it was not acceptable she stole 'just for being hungry'.
&gt; 
&gt; Louisa Sewell was the latest victim of benefit sanctions to appear before magistrates when she stole a four pack of Mars bars, worth just 75p, from Heron Foods in the Swan Centre, Kidderminster, on June 22, because she had not eaten in days.
&gt; 
&gt; Adrian Jones, prosecuting, said the 32-year-old was seen on CCTV picking the confectionary and putting it in her body warmer before leaving the store without paying.
&gt; 
&gt; In mitigation, her solicitor Susie Duncan said Sewell's benefits had been sanctioned and she had no money or anyone to turn to for help so had not eaten for days when she stole the cheapest food from the store.
&gt; 
&gt; She said: 'She fully accepts this offence of theft. She said she was really hungry. She had no money. She took the lowest value item she could find.'""
&gt; 
&gt; (Full report here: http://www.kidderminstershuttle.co.uk/news/1358...)
&gt; 
&gt; In fines and charges, the woman was penalised £328.75 for stealing food worth 75p - over 438 times the value of the theft. It seems likely that she'll be unable to pay and may end up in prison.
&gt; 
&gt; In the same week, the newspapers reported a wealthy and privileged young City investment banker who escaped jail after angrily glassing two people in a nightclub because the judge feared a prison sentence would damage his career.
&gt; 
&gt; (Story: http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/banker-wee...)
&gt; 
&gt; We can't fix every injustice in the hideous, heartless society the UK has become. We're a Scottish website and the woman in question doesn't even live in Scotland. But there are no borders on solidarity, and for some reason this case hit us as a particularly sickening one. We can do something, even if it's only a gesture.
&gt; 
&gt; £500 is the lowest target Indiegogo allow, but it'll pay the woman's fine and court costs, and a little more to help her out. 
&gt; 
&gt; We'll donate any further excess to Scottish foodbank/poverty charities, including First Base in Dumfries which is run by occasional Wings contributor Mark Frankland and is currently facing a funding crisis.

Some feminists don't even like that line for exactly that reason, they don't want people who are genuine believers in equality getting in the way of their crusade. If you wanted, you could find feminists explaining themselves why they don't like it on SRSdiscussion. 

And even if that wasn't the case, it would still be a bad name, it would be like calling believers of racial equality 'whiteists' or 'blackists'.

Now this is actually an interesting point, but we're straying here a little. 

As I say though he broke the whip between about 5% to upwards of 25% of the time. Overall on online public records, which do not stretch as far back as the beginning of his career, that's around 13%-ish. 

I'd argue that still pretty much embeds him in general labour policy thinking, following the whip 87% of the time. But it is regular enough to cast doubt on his ability to enforce it given it gives could reason for his detractors to outright reject him, even though he's stuck by them well enough for the most of the time, at least. 

Given that how will Corbyn handle the whip? He might well have some insight in seeing it from the other side but we'd have to see.

&gt;Ask Corbyn and his supporters! They're the ones who are about to destroy the party.

&gt;They're the ones who are about to destroy the party.

Yeah... they're not really trying to destroy it, give them some credit. They're trying to change it. They might be right or wrong, but they're not trying to purposefully tank it.

Although, I mean it could be a ragnarok like change, certainly Danczuk's coming out like it's the end times.

Did you actually listen to the whole show? It wasn't even about infant feeding, the whole show was making sure women were put in their place. And this was all done on a publicly funded stage. Literally years of NHS work to better the health of babies and reduce the risk of babies dying would be undone if his ""opinions"" (which he dressed up as fact!!) caught on. 

Anyone who phoned in to disagree that women shouldn't have to have signs around their neck warning others, or be housebound for two years, were told they were ""hormonal"". Men who disagreed were told they were lying just to humour their wives. 

But if you're a ""yummy mummy"" or a ""wag"" then its ok to breastfeed in public, probably because tits like that are nice tits and he enjoys drooling over them.

Do you have any comprehension just how hurtful this is to some of the most vulnerable members of society? Infant feeding has become one of these things where you're damned if you do an damned if you don't. I've breastfed and apparently that makes me ugly, I'm disgusting and I should be ashamed of myself for feeding my baby in public when she wasn't even crying (because resorting to tears before every meal is somehow ok)! I'm also being compared to someone who commits sexual acts in public. I've also bottle fed due to tongue tie and had to deal with the guilt of having a baby in SCBU for a week due to an infection from formula, i've had derogatory comments in cafes, I've been looked down on from health professionals. Told repeatedly I'm not doing whats best for my baby.

The whole infant feeding shaming thing going on needs to stop. Why should it be ok humiliate and victimise new mothers on live radio publicly? He can have his opinions if he wants to, but to nationally accuse anyone who disagrees as being wrong and factually incorrect is not on.

You have to be prepared to travel though. My nearest supermarket is around 25/30 mins away, if I want to see a film or a band bigger then a pub band, then it's at least an hours drive to get there.

If you don't know people in the area, it can be isolating. There tend to be fewer 'groups' and activities going on ( compared to cities) for younger folk. There are good groups for the 'older' folks though

But that said some of the nicest people I've met have been here in the Dales. There is great locally produced food available, fantastic pubs and inns, good markets, and so on.

Cooper saying ""Two white men shouldn't lead the Labour party."" Was far worse though, for one thing Watson is behind Creasy in the polls so she literally said it to make a point. Which gender you are shouldn't matter, what you say should and that has been reflected very clearly in this leadership election so far.

I can honestly see where Tessa Jowell is coming from, the company that made the ad that sparked the debate was famously acted appallingly to those with complaints on twitter but to ban it is obscene. 

If you're going to ban that, ban advertisements for gambling, alcohol and anything offering a lifestyle to aspire to, soon enough you've banned the entire media.

This 'femninst ideology' is probably the opposite of actual feminist ideology, the 'check your privilege' lot don't realise they're devaluing people's opinions based on their race, class, background and ableness, the very thing they're supposed to be campaigning against.

To me, the argument is that it's inherently retrograde to have a leadership and deputy leadership occupied only by men, and I agree.

&gt;She's also implying that the Labour Party is suppressing women by voting for men. Can you really look at this leadership election and tell me that gender is playing a significant role? Really? This is divisive.

The greenwich meridian is an artificial construct. It is where we say it is. It's not possible for it to be ""wrong"".

GPS uses a model of the Earth's shape that is called WGS84, but it's a model, it's not completely accurate. It was designed in the US and they used a point somewhere in the USA as a reference. 90 degrees away at Greenwich, there is a small error, so 0 degrees doesn't actually lie on top of the meridian.

That doesn't mean that the line is in the wrong place. It just means that GPS doesn't measure the same thing.

Of course he can be leader. I said practically speaking it's a weak point for him and as I say an unknown in how that will work itself out. It's a really good point to raise, but Corbyn has for the majority of his tenure been part of the labour block vote.

yeah, aren't they members though? I know it's not the PLP and that makes it risky. But if we start talking about who's outside of parliament and who's an inner party member then I wonder if it's a bit Orwellian. Shouldn't it come down to who are they representing rather than the group in parliament, really? I mean I know it was controversial to have Ed Milliband in because of the union vote, but the party seemed to rally round him as best it could.

But I also do have problems with people signing up for it on a whim for it though. I agree with you there. Bad or good, it's not a great idea, but Labour have left themselves a bit open on this one.

Fair. But, there are plenty of outstanding women politicians in the UK. It will not be long before one is far superior to her male rivals in a leadership election. The Labour Party is in a crisis at the moment and it needs its best people to lead it. I have heard that Civil Servants have a lot of respect for Yvette, and positioning herself in this way is clever. She will have shown herself to be incredibly able if she takes this contest from the hands of Corbyn, so I have no qualms if she wins. But, I do not approve of divisive politics like this.  

&gt; I dunno, I honestly think stuff like journalists asking Liz Kendall about her weight is sexist. Moreover, I think people are remarkably dismissive of Yvette, over her marriage of all things, when she is in fact a Harvard educated economist and former treasury minister.

I agree, but, I think it would be fair to say that these factors are not what is deciding the leadership race at the moment.

Quality of life immeasurably better. Drove everywhere in London, and in the same time it took to go to Central London, can now reach Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield, York or Harrogate.

In London everything is on the doorstep as the crow flies, but it takes as long to reach as driving 30-50 miles up here.

Yorkshire and Lincolnshire have great produce and livestock.

EDIT: obvious plusses of being out of London - less pollution, much much less traffic, can food shop just from farm shops, can grow veg easily, property price much lower. Most minuses would have applied to me in my 20s, maybe 30s. Too old and boring to need London now....

Entrenched dominance of elite positions of power by men (particularly upper class / privately educated / white men) is a real thing and it is self perpetuating like all stable systems due to natural tendency to pick people similar to you. Having a few years where you force about 50% of the cabinet to be women is not necessarily a bad idea. It's a temporary way to provoke a much needed change. The alternative is you accept that that the status quo of massive and historical under representation of women is either just ok or due to there being a shortage of female talent.

BTW I am normally the one challenging the idea of women being discriminated against. I believe young women generally are having a better time in British society then men their age and the data supports me. But right at the top CEO / board room / cabinet office level this is not true and something must be done about that.

What would make me even happier is if he said 50% have to come from working class or lower middle class backgrounds, but that sadly is never going to happem.

The way she treated these countries with her indiscriminate policies, where she had very little political mandate and with no consultation with the Welsh and Scottish public involved, irrevocably damaged the concept of the UK as a centralised unitary state. You only really have to look at the results of the devolution referendums in the late 70's, to the results in the late 90's, to see what happened. 

If there's one person that helped the cause of Scottish and Welsh devolution, and eventually the cause of Scottish independence, it was her. She might not had started this division and the history of those movements go back far into the past, but her 11 years of rule was really the turning point, the last strew, the outcome of which eventually lead to the UK we have today.

there is a lot of evidence to show women have different priorities in life to men when it comes to their careers. Having a family, having more time off work, working less overtime, for instance. 

Considering the amount of work you have to put in to be a 'qualified' MP, I would say women are less likely to become politicians because of these things. 

This doesn't mean they're not capable at all, it just means they're less likely to want the job. Of course, there are exceptions, but most of it comes down to the choices men and women make. 

The debate shouldn't be whether it is sexist to have  less than a 50% female cabinet, but rather whether a 50% representation in the cabinet is beneficial, especially if they have gotten there through quotas, where less quailified candidates are likely to get picked over their more qualified male counterparts. And before anyone says this is sexist, consider that there are more males interested in cabinet jobs than women. this means there is probably a higher threshold in their qualifications, simply because there is more of them.

Of course, there are benefits to having more women in cabinet positions, but there are also benefits to having the best qualified person in the job, regardless of their sex age or skin colour.

Yes.  If someone consistently rebels against their own party then it would probably be unwise to elect them to run that party.  Especially if they don't have the support of the other MPs. 

&gt;yeah, aren't they members though?

Well, they paid the 3 pounds to vote.  Doesn't mean that they have the best interests of the party at heart.  

&gt;But I also do have problems with people signing up for it on a whim for it though. I agree with you there.  Bad or good, it's not a great idea, but Labour have left themselves a bit open on this one.

Agreed.  Stopping the hard-left has been a consistent problem for the Labour party, and it looks like they've really messed up this time.  Corbyn is likely to win, and this is going to damage the party for years.  

They're faced with two ugly choices.  Either let him stay on as leader, in which case the party is finished.  Or get rid of him, in which case everyone to the left of Tony Blair is going to complain that they're ignoring the democratic will -  in which case the party will become a joke for years.

Personally, I think that getting rid of him is the only viable solution.  For christ's sake - this is a guy who, by the looks of things, is associating with Holocaust deniers.  It's unthinkable that he could be allowed to run a major party.

Want a pie? Bloody hell I love pie. It just tastes a tonne better, and is a lot healthier if I make it at home (including pastry). Think of the calories you burn cooking stuff from scratch. 

There's nothing wrong with 'unhealthy' food in moderation - although, it's a lot better if it's homemade. Science shows fresh food tastes better, the longer you spend thinking about a food and waiting for it the better it tastes, and cooking from scratch gives you satisfaction that makes food taste better. Home-made pie all round.

I just think someone is making silly money selling these diet books to overweight people who keep buying them. If they buy them to lose weight, and then buy another diet book 6 months later, clearly neither has worked.

There was also a good study done a couple of years ago that found people do not stick to the diet prescribed in the books - they make up their own, even if a dietician is helping them follow the book.

Low carb does seem to be healthier - but we cant figure out if that's just because people stop calling Domino's. I quit carbs for a while, felt better, and rubbish again when I ate supermarket bread - but fine when I made my own. (Anecdotal evidence not proper evidence)

Cool. I disagree. 

I agree that it's risky in terms of him running PLP, but the question is who they are representing. And more to the point rebelling every once in a while doesn't make you part of totally different causes, otherwise we'd have a multitude of parties when someone became apostate. And within the framework of the Labour party like the Conservative party are loads of different interested groups and beliefs normally circulating around similar themes, joined by common cause.

But if a rebel is not be leader, then Blair would have gone elsewhere. He rebelled in a delightfully unheard of way, by completely changing the party's focus. Now whether you agree with that or not, it certainly changed things and some argue it allowed them to win.

Unquestioning loyalty should never carry the distinction of giving you the top job, if so, then politics truly has become a career as opposed to something a bit more noble. But that's getting idealistic so I'll stop there.

&gt;Stopping the hard-left has been a consistent problem for the Labour party

Well the hard left do a have a right (hurhur) to vote. Technically everyone does, apparently, but I'm saying there should have been a cap on when they were allowed to join up and vote. This shit here is just open to abuse.

&gt;in which case the party is finished.

And I know you want to see it as the end times, but to be honest we'll have to see. Helping out with digging a grave like Danczuk wants to isn't exactly a wise idea though.

I don't think it implies that at all.

The current crop of MPs have an average age of 50.  These people grew up 30 to 40 years ago.  A lot of women their age who could have become perfectly capable MPs would have either been dissuaded from doing so, or held back by implicit and explicit barriers if they did try to enter politics.

The implication is simply that there is a time lag between the improvement in opportunity equality and seeing that reflected in actual representation.  Women were capable all along, but it takes time for more of them to a) choose to enter politics, and b) make it to MP level without being held back or overlooked because of their sex or gender.

Because reasonably, given the world that we live in, it's pretty obvious that you wouldn't get equal representation under a meritocratic system, because whilst the number of men and women is roughly 50:50, the number of men and women who were encouraged to take or do well in the classes that give you the skills needed, the number of men and women who have had a continuous career to gain experience and skills without a break for child birth/rearing, the number of men and women who are told by their families and peers that they would be well suited to that role, the number of men and women who feel comfortable putting themselves forward for public office with our country's journalists.... none of those are 50:50.

So less women get through those hurdles at the level required to compete. The ones that get through them and apply are held to the same standards as everyone else because it's meritocratic, not ""X-factor's I had a hard life contest"".

Again I am quite impartial to it all, however this will be a continuing critique following Corbyns election. Corbyn may end up surging to national popularity or he may also flail and fall as Labours appeal beyond unions and the far left dwindles.

These supermarkets instead of employing their delivery drivers on PAYE, they are forcing drivers to register for VAT and sign up for the flat rate scheme. In a nutshell the flat rate scheme enables small business owners to charge their customers VAT at the appropriate rate but then only pay HMRC a lower percentage of their gross takings which usually is quite good for contractors, consultants etc because it means they usually pay less if they were operating regular VAT accounting. As part of the scheme the businesses still have to issue invoices with 20% rate of VAT. So the supermarkets make their drivers sign up for VAT then provide them with their van, fuel, uniform etc, the delivery drivers then issue a VAT invoice and then these supermarkets can reclaim the VAT back as its for business use. Technically this is legal but it is tax avoidance in its purest form and these big supermarket chains pocket a lot VAT from this scheme.

null,null,SpaceboyMcGhee,,Misguided Glory Hunter,null,"&gt;Barcelona have insisted on a buy-back option for the teenager and could also insert a clause which enables them to have the final say on any bids that Villa may receive. 

I think we really need details of this to know how to assess this transfer.  I mean if they have a buyback clause of like £30m then that's all fine and dandy and we can expect either a big return down the line, or the player to stick around.  If however it's really low (as was rumoured with Deulofeu's move to Everton), lets say £10m.. then it's really just a loan deal where we bear all of the risk and he's pretty certain to be resigned by them a few years down the line if it actually does work out.  

I'm wondering in the second instance if he wouldn't even need to become good enough to play for Barca (which would offer us some protection as obviously that's a pretty high bar) as if the price is low enough they could conceivably want to buy him back just to sell him on elsewhere at a profit.  I'm trying to think if there's any way he'd be ok with that though, as obviously as in all transfers the player could veto a move... I mean if there is profit to be made for them selling to a third party I suppose they could just split some of that with him.. but in that case it would probably be in his interest to be sold directly to that third party as cutting Barca out of the deal would free up however much their buyback clause is to pay him off.. Hmmm so maybe it is ok, ha ha, I'm just thinking out loud here, anyone else got any thoughts?

So is there another source to back up the title then?

Also, Hillsborough happened in 1989, are we to also assume that for the following **eight years** there wasn't another investigation because John Major was doing Rupert Murdoch a personal favour too? That's pretty libelous to write without any sources. Oh wait, it's the Mirror, maybe they'll print that too.


Also, Labour did launch a sort of inquiry, the Stuart-Smith inquiry which basically agreed with the Taylor Inquiry:

&gt; If blame had not already been allocated, there would unquestionably be very good grounds for a further full public inquiry, but we have known since Lord Taylor's report that Sheffield city council, Sheffield Wednesday football club and, principally, South Yorkshire police were to blame.

Well, this is the bind that Labour have got themselves into.  If Corbyn wins then they can either keep him on, in which case they will be committing party suicide - or they can depose him, in which case they will be accused of going against a democratic vote.

I personally favor the latter option.  I don't think it's an easy decision, but I think they will have to get rid of him for the sake of the party.

Is it be morally justified to depose someone who's just won a leadership election?

Of course there is no evidence this is the case. In fact any study looking into whether it was effective would face serious problems with it being unethical due to the fact no one would ever volunteer to be in this study and because of the risk to peoples quality of life when they lost benefits was too high to allow anyone to be sanctioned in such a manner. 

So it's arguably too unethical and risky for experts to do highly controlled studies into this idea but fine for a government to enact this policy en-masse because of some one liner. There is a kind of logic to the argument but there is a kind of logic to the idea that people in Australia should fall off the Earth because they're upside down.  

Ultimately this isn't about weight loss it's about setting the precedent that people who have negative qualities are not the governments responsibility. It turns an incredibly complicated issue to help people in crazy circumstances into a very simple issue with a simple solution, to dump them. Of course the negative qualities are said not to come about through a complex set of circumstances because that would entertain the possibility that it wasn't entirely someone's fault. No these negative qualities such as not seeking treatment for obesity come down to *choice* and choices are magic because they are totally independent of everything apart from the person and so when someone makes a bad choice then they are a bad person and so can be treated badly such as by having benefits taken away. If the people in government don't want to take any responsibility for fat people who refuse treatment then I welcome that.

I do agree with your statement. I have a friend I haven't saw in years (I moved to diff. country)
We loved each other like a brothers (only we aren't brothers) we ate together, slept in same bed, spent time together, lived together for a while, and for all intents and purposes you could say that we were a couple, only we never got sexual because we are both straight, and that part was the only thing that would separate us from a gay couple.

I am saying this because I recently stated to a gay friend who was boring everyone to death with a story about love and feelings (yes we know that gay couples love each other, otherwise they would just swing around (and if they do, more power to them, I ain't judging), but he was rambling and getting annoying, and I finally told him about my relationship with my friend. 
And how we were practically in love with each other, I can honestly say that I love that man, and he loves me, (not in the same way ofc, because there is no sexual attraction), but we also used to hug each other, ofc we weren't holding hands when taking a walk, but you get what I mean. Anyhow, I finally said to my gay friend, that only thing that separates my relationship with that friend, from his relationship is that we didn't sexually attracted each other, but all other components were there, I cared for him and he cared for me. So all in all, being gay boils down to sex (as we all know) and I told him, only thing that you two have and we don't is that you both love to give it/take it up the shitter. So stop rambling about emotions. That shut him up. 
Again, I will state that I am not homophobic, nor judgemental, I think that everything goes between consenting adults.
Just not my cup of tea.

I guess you could argue that he'd have to be to warrant Barca buying him back (assuming my paranoia about them just buying him back to sell on again is unfounded) but given his age I can still imagine a scenario where he doesn't really add much to the team for a couple seasons but we give him a spot for primarily developmental purposes, then in 3 years time he has half a great season and, still only 22, they think he's worth a punt at £10m to knock around the edge of their first team and see if he kicks on again.

They don't say shit to anyone else, and they just bottle it up inside until they burst. I give you props for not being a cunt like them. 

You're asking for help? Well here's the low down: You ask, we tell, you do. Got it? Think of the past as something you want to chase. You want that feeling back? Or are you just looking down at your present situation? Take that warm pocket of air that used to be a powerful feeling and turn it into a fucking summer beach breeze. Life ain't something handed to you on a silver platter. You gotta do shit for yourself now. Everything is allo about being active. Active mind, active thinking, active life. You think that happy people are lazy? No they aren't. Being happy is always doing something. When you don't have shit to do, you ease yourself into complacency. Do you want to be complacent? Like a fucking rock? No you don't. You wanna be a fucking force of nature like a glacier surfing across the land, making it's own path, giving no fucks about where it goes, and crushing anything in its way.

You said you were a lazy fat bastard? Then take one part away from that. Just be a fat bastard and eventually the fat will go away on its own. Don't have money to not be lazy? Then take a walk around the block. Better yet, jog. Even better? SPRINT THAT SHIT AWAY. There's a book by Haruki Murakami called ""When I talk about running"" and you know what running is about? Do you think it's about fitness? No shit it is. But not to everyone. Running is about setting a goal. You need to set that goal, even if it's a fake goal, fucking just try to run towards a lamppost. Then run past it. Don't limit yourself to one thing. I mentioned a book? Then read that book if you can. Can't afford it? There are cheaper methods to read books. 

You know, after moving to a new country with literally no one with me last year (it's been 10 months) it's been really hard to cope. But you know what I did? I set up a thing to live by called a non-zero day. You know what a non zero day is? Every day, you don't end up as a zero. Every day you improve yourself through either experience, skills, or whatever. I don't care if you learned how to draw a perfect zero, or if you bought a new hat. Those are +1's in my eyes. Just don't make your day be zero. Go to the gym? +1. Make a new friend? +1. Contribute information to a topic? +1. Everything you do is a fucking plus one. 

You know where hope comes from? Hope comes from you. Hope is the easier version of discipline. Hope can't be alone without discipline. That's like a person praying without doing anything. I don't care if you're religious or not, the whole dynamic of energy entering a system and energy leaving a system is basically energy cannot be created nor destroyed. You have to do shit for something to happen. You just can't like hope you can stand and just stay sitting the whole time. You have to engage in the process.

Here's the low down and the tl;dr if you don't wanna read the novel I wrote just for you.

JUST FUCKING DO SOMETHING. Do something every day. Do push ups, be self centered. Treat yourself. Then make friends once you're comfortable treating yourself, and treat them as yourself.

Why does it make me move against them? Well I see the above idea as irrationality. If Yvette only says this, and makes it up, I could see myself going back to her, even though this had pushed her off first choice for me. SC is definitely not getting my first choice at all after her stupid-as-hell response to an innocent question on vests. I personally can't stand people who are so uptight that they take it as an offence that someone dared ask an innocent question. So no, Yvette is redeemable, Stella ain't. 

As for Tessa, her posters thing had turned me against her, more like Stella than Yvette, as I can't see myself changing my mind. Firstly, the posters aren't a priority, she should be shouting from the rooftops that we need to deal with homelessness, not her pet projects on feminism. Secondly, I am completely against the ban. I utterly disagree with every fibre of my being that it is sexist and offensive to put up a picture of a thin woman. For starters, it happens all the time to men and people don't complain. But the broader thing for me is that I feel the country is way too sex-negative.

The other big issue would be FFP, which in it's simplest form says that we can only spend money we make. That would be a huge issue in terms of our spending, except for the fact that FFP does not take into account what they consider ""one time expendiatures"", which the stadium falls under.

Here it is dude: 

&gt;Caribbean and Pakistani babies are more than twice as likely to die before the age of one as White British or Bangladeshi babies in part due to a higher prevalence of preterm birth and congenital anomalies, respectively, in these particular groups.

&gt;Explanations for variations in infant mortality between ethnic groups are complex, involving the interplay of deprivation, physiological, behavioural and cultural factors

&gt;There is considerable heterogeneity between different ethnic groups in both the causes and the risk factors for infant mortality.

&gt;Women do get harassed for feeding their babies in public. They get sent to bathrooms, told to throw blankets over their baby's heads, told they're attention seeking, asked to leave places.

I know that, and it's a shame.

I just don't accept your conclusion that:

&gt;Views like that have a very real impact on women trying to choose the best start in life for their children.

I don't see any evidence to support such a conclusion. And it's a wider point that I hear all to often in respect of countless topics.

Opinions like his are genuinely held opinions, they're not taught. Some people have stupid opinions, stupid beliefs. The freedom to air those opinions, and the freedom of people to critique them, or indeed ridicule them, is a great thing.

If someone on the radio gave an opinion that kids should be banned from playing in the streets because they make too much noise, people would laugh at him and call him stupid.

You could draw the same conclusion (I believe falsely) that you have here, that his opinion would lead to the influence of some members of public then harassing kids playing the street to stop.

Would he be suspended for giving such an opinion?

No.

He'd be widely ridiculed for having a stupid opinion. Some people may agree, like some may have with this DJ's remark about breastfeeding, but the consensus would be 'stupid' and ridicule.

&gt; By the closing years of the war, all the major powers were seeking faster planes. Piston engines and propellers limited airspeed to 500 miles an hour. Like Germany, Russia had already experimented with rocket planes. But rocket planes weren't maneuverable. They burned straight and fast. A new form of propulsion was needed: the ""turbo-jet."" The British labor government, in 1946, helped the Russians leap ahead by making them a gift of the best jet engines in the world: The Rolls Royce ""Nene."" Stalin's response: ""Who would be so stupid as to give us their best engines?""

The other personality, when discussing about the similarities of this team to 13/14, pointed out we haven't replaced Sterling, Suarez and Sturridge is injured.
That's what we signed Firmino and Benteke for although the transition may not be up to our expectations or take longer.

We have a really good 25 man squad and a more convincing game plan than to attack and hope for the best.

null,null,Lateralis85,null,null,null,"I am currently doing the reverse journey - I live in South East London, got a job in Cambridge and am currently commuting whilst trying to find a place to live in the Cambridge area. 

I travel to Cambridge via London Liverpool Street. I purchase advanced tickets for specific trains through the web and that still costs me between £20 and £25 per day. I am fortunate in that I can work from home one day a week, but each month I'm spending about £400 just on national rail trains. 

Travelling through King's Cross is more expensive as it is with a different company on a quicker route so you can expect to pay more. 

The time element also comes into it. My journey door-to-door is about 3 hours each way, from near Lewisham to West Cambridge site.  Your journey will probably be shorter, especially if you go via King's Cross, but national rail trains take about an hour at their quickest. Depending on your journey either side of the train trip you could be commuting for 3-4 hours a day and spend hundreds a month on a national rail season ticket. 

Money and time may be no object to you, but my advice from personally living and working in London and now commuting to Cambridge is to consider relocating and searching thoroughly for somewhere to live in London. You needn't look for somewhere North London or on the Northern Line - a former colleague used to travel in from near Richmond to UCL near Euston in about an hour door to door.

Left school at 16 though went back to college at 18 and ran the typical A-Level and Degree route. Though my understanding became that industry based people valued set experience much more than any qualifications. So while I was a student, as I had a lot of free time I used the opportunity to get involved with local low budget feature film productions as a Runner (often for free). This was the start of networking for me and before long I was meeting people who also worked in more high end TV as well as these low budget productions. I decided to side step into the locations department as I thought driving around with a camera, meeting people and scouting for interesting places sounded really good fun - which it is! Also, hardly anyone in Newcastle was doing it for some reason so my progression has been quite quick (some have suggested too quick). I've had to work away from home quite a lot too. I found the hardest part was going from low budget to more high end as people don't want to give you the opportunity, however now I've done that I tend to be able to pick and choose jobs a lot more as the rate of pay is often the same no matter the job just the project has less over finance to complete.

Losing you means that the efficiency of the office will decrease proportionately to the amount of work you put in, and now the manager has to hire and train a new recruit. That new recruit has big shoes to fill. 

He's being angsty because he didn't see your resignation coming, because his office will become less efficient and because he has to now choose, hire and train somebody new out of the branch operating profits and so late in the year. Unless they're paying incredibly well, it's likely they'll take on someone with a bit of experience who will take 3-6 months to settle in the role. The average cost of hiring an employee and training them over the first 3 months is £18k.

Essentially, he has to spend £18k and won't see anything for it until next year, meanwhile the branch will be operating below current standards and he's at risk of losing his annual bonus, perks or something similar.

The public basically get to choose between the guy the conservatives select, and the guy that labour selects. I don't think they've been offered a candidate like that. I think Chukka Amouna would have had a good shot, but he dropped out. 

You also need to note that the UK is much less diverse than the US, and if you are looking back more than about 20 years for your example prime-ministers, it was increasingly less diverse then. 

So, to answer your question, no, I can't think of a ethnic minority leader of the labour or conservative party in the past hundred years. That's not the publics problem though.

Harsh result, very poor refereeing, but we also missed some sitters, which we can't afford to do in this league.

**The appointment of Alex Neil in January had a massive impact on results. How do you think he will handle himself in the Premier League?**

Alex is a great manager, no doubt. But as someone once said, ""It's better to be a lucky manager than a good one."" So time will tell on that one. 

**Who are the Norwich players that fans should be keeping an eye on this season?**

100% Nathan Redmond. Really kicked on at the end of last season, and was one of the key performers for us in the playoffs. Was one of the only players to come away from a bad tournament for the U21s with any credit. Didn't start the first game due to short summer, but he may well be out top goal scorer this year.

**You’re rumoured to be looking for a striker at the moment. Who’s on your shopping list before the window closes?**

I would honestly rather sign a centre back or right back than a striker. I think the team has enough goals in it to stay up (Jermone, Johnson, Hoolahan, Redmond, Howson), but I'm not sure our defence is anywhere near Premier League standard. 

**The last time both teams met, the game finished 0 - 0. What’s your prediction for the game?**

Based on the performance of both teams in the opening game, I would like to think Norwich have a good chance of winning 1-2 or 0-1.

**Sunderland are one of the favourites for relegation. What are your thoughts on Sunderland’s chances this year, and what do you make of their squad?**

null,null,SuffragettePizza,null,null,null,"I actually did it the other way around - I lived in the sticks until I was 19 and then moved to a big city. I think the differences depend largely on how rural you're talking, as a Market Town or a large village will be much less of a culture shock than living in the sticks or a hamlet. If you want isolation and countryside right on your doorstep then pick a more rural location or a small village/hamlet. If you want more access to shops and a regular bus route then a large village or a market town is the way to go!

I find the pace of life is much slower in rural areas, which I personally think is a positive - it's less about going out and cramming everything in and more about pottering around! There's also a stronger sense of community, everyone knows everyone, and you get to know what you can rely on people for. That can be really nice - for example you know that Sue runs a yoga class at the village hall on Tuesday evenings, you know that Barry from down the road can fix your washing machine, you know that the farm up the road will sell you scrap wood for cheap etc. The downside is that if there's any drama then it can go on for **years** and it can feel quite suffocating! 

The main differences in my opinion are shops and travel. You have to be prepared to drive to places even for the simplest things and you have to plan a bit in advance - like making sure you have extra milk in the house so you don't have to drive for 30 minutes to the nearest shop, and having to drive for 20 minutes to take something to the post office. Also, if your car breaks down it can be a bit of a nightmare, especially if it's going to take more than an afternoon to get it fixed.

I'd say there's more going on in villages/towns in terms of community events though - there's usually multiple pubs within walking distance, classes at the village hall, fetes, church bands, acting groups, choirs, bell ringing groups. I think because there's less already set up for people to do and you get to know everyone, people are more inclined to set up little groups than they might be in big cities.

What you'll need to come up to Cambridge will vary slightly from college to college, and between subjects, so you will probably be given a checklist by your college pretty soon. Aside from that, to give you an idea, you will need clothes for matriculation (the ceremony by which you are officially signed-in to the university) and for formal hall (a formal dinner colleges have in the evening several times a week - it's optional but is normally a cheap and nice 3-course meal). These are typically a suit or a dress (often asked to be dark for matriculation - college will let you know). Every college also has a 'gown' - used for formal hall and Matriculation. You will be able to buy this when you arrive in Cambridge, and can normally be bought through you college rather than finding your own through a shop in Cambridge. Each college has its own design of gown. 

For Phys NatSci, you shouldn't need to buy any textbooks in your first year, or possibly at all - the libraries in the colleges, departments and the central University Library are all extremely well stocked. You may be sent an 'preparation reading list' for some of the options. These books aren't strictly compulsory (unless otherwise indicated) but can be helpful in deciding what options to take and giving you an idea of what they are like. 

At Cambridge, you'll be asked to buy a specific university-approved calculator. There are two options, both of which are available cheaply during Freshers' Week. Other calculators aren't allowed to be used in university exams, so hold off buying a shiny new one until you get here! You'll also get the chance to buy a labcoat, which is necessary for Chemistry and Materials Science (and some other) practical sessions. In my first year, if you took Chemistry as an option, you could get your labcoat free courtesy of BP, otherwise I think it was about £10. 

I'll try and think of anything else, but congratulations again, and enjoy the rest of the summer! :)

People this overweight aren't just lazy. They are almost certainly suffering from mental illness in some way that causes them to eat so much and not exercise.

CHRIS GILES — ECONOMICS EDITOR


   Although Jeremy Corbyn’s proposal of “people’s quantitative easing” is in his manifesto as only “an option”, some have hailed it as a magic solution to Britain’s economic challenges.


   The policy’s cheerleader-in-chief is Richard Murphy, a leftwing tax campaigner, who says people’s QE “would stimulate the economy, boost employment and tackle climate change”.


   Mr Corbyn, Mr Murphy and others such as Ken Livingstone say people’s QE would be different to the QE undertaken by the Bank of England from 2009 to 2012 as it would support infrastructure rather than prop up the banking system. Yesterday Mr Livingstone told the BBC: “If we can get the bank to fund the banking system, why don’t we get them to build a proper broadband system . . . or modernise our transport system?”


   This is how “ordinary” QE and people’s QE compare.
   Decision on need for QE


   Who takes the decision to instigate QE, the creation of additional central bank money? In 2009-12, that was the role of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee, although it required Treasury authorisation. With people’s QE the government would order the central bank to print money and determine how much.
   Printing money
   In both ordinary and people’s QE, the BoE “prints money”. There is no difference between the two.


   Use of money created
   In 2009-12, the BoE mostly purchased existing government debt. Since many people wanted to own government debt, these purchases eased the government’s ability to create more by running a large budget deficit and reducing the pace of spending cuts. People’s QE is almost identical, since Mr Murphy proposes that the central bank buys bonds created by a national infrastructure bank “under government direction and subject to government guarantees”. These would be the equivalent of gilts, which are created by the National Debt Office.


   Tax and expenditure
   In both cases the government would decide how much tax it would raise, how much it would spend and what it would make a priority. Mr Corbyn is clear infrastructure spending would be a high priority . These decisions are separate from the QE decision.


   Cancellation of purchased bonds
   Under the 2009-12 QE programme, the bonds have not been cancelled and the BoE can still sell them. Mr Murphy proposes cancelling the bonds, in effect making the money creation permanent. Technical purists would argue that a future government can destroy money just as easily as create it. It would simply issue new debt without running a deficit and cancel the money collected.


   Propping up the banking system
   The 2009-12 version was not intended to prop up the banking system. The BoE bought few government bonds from banks and the money was not used to recapitalise them. The money required to recapitalise — or nationalise — banks was raised by standard government borrowing, not money printing, despite what Mr Corbyn and Mr Livingstone say.


   Assessment
   The distinction between people’s QE and ordinary QE boils down to whether the government or officials at the central bank have control of the monetary printing press, and whether the assets are cancelled after purchase.


   There is no doubt that people’s QE ends the operational independence of monetary policy as the government, not the BoE, would decide whether to pump more money into the UK. At present, the MPC is split between doing nothing and tightening monetary policy with higher interest rates. None of its nine members advocates using monetary policy to boost demand and growth.


   Mr Murphy says BoE operational independence of monetary policy is a myth and is, in any case, undesirable.
   If the government prints money for infrastructure, either the amount of infrastructure bought would be decided by the perceived need for extra stimulus or the government would first determine the right amount of infrastructure regardless of whether it left the economy with too much or too little demand. The risk is rampant inflation or deflation.


   If everyone agreed more stimulus was needed, there is a live debate on the merits of traditional QE and outright monetary financing of deficits by cancelling the public sector bonds created. People’s QE does not deserve its magic status: if a government wants to make infrastructure a priority, it already has the tools.",null,0,null,1439542967,null,null,false,0,cu2lim4,null,t3_3gyfsz,null,null,null,t3_3gyfsz,null,null,null,1441243438,null,-1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

null,null,Gospartan7,null,null,null,"Sky Bet League 2 Match Round 2 will see the latest edition of the Dockyard Derby between Plymouth Argyle and Portsmouth take place.
It is a fixture that rarely fails to deliver entertainment, with only four goalless draws having occurred in the 56 meetings since 1921. 

The game marks the opening home match of the 2015/16 campaign for Argyle, with Home Park playing host to the clash at 3pm on Saturday. 

Goals, goals, goals 

The Dockyard Derby always brings goals, and it's been 34 years since the last 0-0 occurred in the fixture. Dominance in the match-up is also infrequent, with no side having registered a league double since the 1988/99 Division Two season, where it was Pompey who won both games. 

In their last 10 outings, there have been three or more goals scored on nine of those occasions, with 12 strikes hitting the back of the net in each of the last three encounters. 

Meetings: 56 
Plymouth wins: 22 
Portsmouth wins: 25 
Draws: 9 
 

Last season it was a win apiece for the coastal rivals, as Plymouth took the spoils in a 3-0 success at Home Park courtesy of a Reuben Reid brace and a Lewis Alessandra strike. 

Portsmouth edged a 2-1 result in the return game at Fratton Park in April, with goals from Jed Wallace and Ryan Taylor enough to fend off a late Oliver Lee volley. 

Both clubs endured strong starts to the new Sky Bet League 2 campaign last weekend; Plymouth won 2-0 away at AFC Wimbledon and Portsmouth secured a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, ensuring both sit in the top seven going into Match Round 2. 

The pair were involved in Capital One Cup action in midweek, too, but suffered contrasting fortunes. 

Argyle were ousted by a late Gillingham comeback, after Craig Tanner put them ahead with just 12 minutes of normal time remaining - Gills duo Bradley Dack and Jake Hessenthaler hit late goals to send the Sky Bet League 1 side into the Round 2 draw. 

Portsmouth, on the other hand, enjoyed a momentous night in front of their home support, as Adam McGurk and Conor Chaplin speared them to a 2-1 win over Derby County.

If someone is too depressed to leave the house should we kick them out on the street and cut off their access to food and fresh water? If someone is having anxiety problems and cant face the outside world should we show them tough love and cut off all help if they don't go to appointments?

You're comparing apples and oranges here. If they couldn't work exclusively because of only one of those symptoms, and that symptom was easily treatable and only required the patient to commit to it, then it would be comparable.

&gt;People this overweight aren't just lazy. They are almost certainly suffering from mental illness in some way that causes them to eat so much and not exercise. We shouldn't give up on them as a society. We should be providing them with the money to keep them off the streets as well as making extra efforts to get them out of the rut they are stuck in.

You're not reading what I've written. I'm not saying ""overweight people are lazy"". I was recently overweight (changed that now, thank fuck) and I wouldn't call myself lazy. However, I recognised the issue and chose to deal with it. I'm referring to obese people who see the problem their weight causes (i.e. making them unable to work) and *actively choose* to do nothing whatsoever about it. They *most definitely* are lazy. And selfish too. If someone is *trying* to lose weight and struggling, then resources should be focused on helping them achieve their goal. If someone is overweight and does nothing about it because it's far easier than losing it and going back to work, then we shouldn't waste time and resources enabling them when there are people who are genuinely trying who need the support more.

&gt;I don't even think the chronically lazy should be punished for skipping appointments unless they are defrauding the system.

Arguably they are, to an extent. The welfare system in this instance is supposed to be a safety net to help them back on to their feet. If they treat it as a hammock at everyone else's expense (including allocating resources away from those who need help) then they are defrauding the system in that sense.

If you can afford up to 150 quid a week, then go for cat 2 or 3 in the new accommodation blocks. The room sizes vary, but they're generally pretty ok and the stuff is slightly newer than in the old accommodation blocks. M-P is being refurbished, but to be brutally honest, I can't see any actual change so far. I'd be surprised if they've changed more than the wiring in there, but let's see.

An alternative is to go for a room in one of the houses, that usually feels a bit less 'college dorm' like and a bit more like living in a shared flat - but it will depend more on getting on with the people living in there!

As to your other questions:

1) I think most people go to Hall for food, but there are plenty that cook for themselves as well. I haven't been there for a while now, as I'm working over summer and getting back late (plus it's closed atm). Meals with sides and some pudding, maybe a coffee will probably cost you about 5 - 6 pounds in total, but it depends what you go for. Quality varies a lot, I've definitely had worse, but don't expect too much. Some stuff turns out to be quite good though. General rule: if there's chicken, go for chicken, except if it's on a stick, then it's probably too dry. :D

2) Is the law faculty on Sidgwick Site? If so, it's literally 4 minutes walking distance.

3) The thing about Wolfson, I think, is that it's nicely average. Hall is not terrible, but not fantastic either, accommodation isn't princely, but also not shabby, the architecture isn't on King's level, but it also doesn't look like Churchill accommodation blocks. So the important part is the community. It's the people and the relaxed, friendly atmosphere that really make it. There's lots of societies, some of them quite successful as well - may I mention that the Men's Squad of the rowing team did very well last Mays, I might or might not have been part of that. ;)

In general, you could have done a lot worse and I'm absolutely sure you'll love it. One thing though: if possible, try to get involved in stuff! The community is very much dependent on people getting out there and being a part of it. No one will expect miracles of you, but we need people being part of committees, organising stuff, etc. If you don't have time for that - and I know shit gets really really stressy - at least try to be social and hang out with people a bit. Come to the bar sometimes, come to the bops, everything gets better for everyone if more people are involved.

I can't really say I dislike much about it. Sometimes when cycling up King's Parade I feel a bit sad I'm not in one of the old, original colleges. But then I see the tourist masses and remember that only a relatively small number of people actually live in the old colleges, most being put in some college-owned housing somewhere else, and I don't mind anymore.

The porters are super helpful and friendly (if you don't break their rules too often, like take a bicycle onto central court), generally college administration seems to actually care, even if their information policies are somewhat reminiscent of the Kreml during the Cold War. I think they don't mean to, they just kind of forget not everyone knows what they've been planning over the last 5 months.

4) I'd say the age average is probably about 23 - 25. As a 21-year-old, you'll definitely (well, by definition) be on the younger side of the spectrum, but the great thing about Wolfson College is that no one cares. We're all a bit older than the just-left-home freshers at Trinity, and a bit more mature, but that doesn't mean we don't have fun and sometimes act crazy - we're just less likely to do really stupid shit. Also, we tend to have fewer entitled twats, so that's nice.

I remember reading about it when she died. I'm trying to find the particular article I'm thinking off but not having much luck. [Here's one](http://www.stylist.co.uk/people/was-thatcher-a-feminist-2)

&gt; Debate rages but one thing is certain: Thatcher disliked feminism. “I owe nothing to women’s lib,” she said during her first term in power.

-

&gt; The thing was Thatcher’s policies went against feminist ideology at the time. She froze child benefit, criticised working mothers for creating a “creche generation” and of her eight female ministerial appointments, all but one (Baroness Young) failed to progress past junior level.

-

&gt;  “She was keen on education but she didn’t believe in [childcare] places that primarily allowed women to go out to work. She believed that was an abdication of the mother’s role,” says Campbell.

It's not that she was misogynistic or anything. She was just a right-winger who believed we lived in a meritocracy, and that feminism wasn't necessary because women could achieve anything just by trying hard, failing to take her own privilege into account.

That article did say this though, which I didn't know

&gt; she was one of the few Conservative MPs to vote both for a bill to decriminalise male homosexuality and one to legalise abortion. “I happen to think that one of the worst things anyone can do in this world is to bring an unwanted child into it,” she said.

She was an interesting woman, no doubt about that. Maybe anti-feminist is a bit strong. More like... viewing it as unnecessary?

Sometimes there are so many of them it literally lasts a minute or two. Then another silence and the marshals release the traffic. 

In my opinion its just another fun thing we have going on here in London and I've only once seen a driver disobey a marshall in Soho, and everyone outside the pub was screaming at him. Londoners like it, tourists like it too and any driver who tries to spoil it like this prick will get stopped whether by the skaters or the people. As far as I know its totally legal. The police and the council haven't stopped it anyway. 

It's Friday night after peak time and it lasts maybe three minutes at most. They move quicker than the traffic too because they overrule the red lights. 

If you get stopped. Respect the marshalls and the skaters. Have fun, enjoy it. Its three fucking minutes. I weep when I hear people like this taxi driver saying he hates these people.

null,null,C1t1zen_Erased,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"You're absolutely right about Fukushima. TEPCO the Japanese electricity utility repeatedly ignored advice from the IAEA and Western plant operators about safety upgrades that should be made, including hydrogen recombiners that would have prevented the explosion. Additionally their sea wall wasn't high enough and their backup diesel generators were at ground level. Their whole attitude and safety culture was abysmal.

Profits before safety is a concern in any industry, and the nuclear has a good track record within the energy industry (fewest deaths per kWh). I'd argue that nuclear accidents aren't more catastrophic than other industrial accidents, [take a look at this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_disasters_by_death_toll) nuclear realted deaths are in the vast minority. I feel that most of the fear related to it comes from a lack of knowledge and understanding. 

For better or worse any accident seems to implicate the nuclear industry as a whole even if the plants, operators and procedures are entirely different to where the accident happened, Germany is an example shutting down their reactors as a knee jerk reaction to an accident that happened due to circumstances that are impossible in Germany. This also means that there is far more incentive to cooperate, share improvements and concerns and not to put profit first as any incident reflects badly on everyone. This is something oil companies get away with much more easily, only BP got blamed for Deepwater Horizon, the entire industry wasn't put into question, with drilling being stopped on the other side of the world in response.

Money wasn't the concern with the pools at Sellafield, producing a British nuclear weapon was the main objective, everything else was secondary. The operations were for military purposes, not civilian so any waste or accidents would have probably been seen as unfortunate but necessary for the UK to acquire the bomb.

I've probably gone a on bit too much, but I really do believe that if you care about climate change and reducing carbon emissions we have no choice but to use nuclear fission for the near future, at least until viable fusion power comes along, if it ever does. Renewables are also part of the solution but I don't think they can make it alone, people shouldn't forget that they also produce waste as nothing is perfectly clean.

This is your problem if you think that. You still, regardless of how good you were at uni (and it still could have been any university - you have said the 2.1 guy went to Oxford but you could have gone to London Met for all we know, which is consistently regarded as one of the worst universities in the country aside from one or two specific subjects), knew absolutely nothing compared to anyone you will be coming across in the sector.

I *am not* defending nepotism - I think it is dreadful that they told you they do not do internships and that this chap is then able to slide in with a connection. However, what it does not mean is that you are amazing and he is shit. Firms will often prefer to take someone with a high background of achievement, a good degree from a top university, and with soft skills rather than specific expert knowledge because no one really has the expert knowledge at all - it has to be drilled into you on the job. So a person who has an obvious interest in the sector but who admits when they are wrong, is not afraid to ask questions, and who does not think that they are already an 'expert in finance', is likely to do better and learn faster than someone who already believes they know a lot.

The way in which you have been most let down is not having people to explain all of this directly. That is extremely unfortunate, especially if you got your first from a top university.

I hate that so much.

I suppose that might be different for a small employer, though, where they think they are the law unto themselves... really I avoid small businesses for that reason.  Out on my own, or in a Corporate Behemoth with HR team with a clue.

Okay, so, patriarchy. Brief definition,

&gt; *Patriarchy is a social system in which males hold primary power, predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property; in the domain of the family, fathers or father-figures hold authority over women and children.*

First half, yes, men hold political power and positions of leadership, but do not hold any sort of moral authority or social privilege, and no longer maintain control of property. The rest of it is also inaccurate.

Included in this situation though is idea that because the people at the top are men, the average man has any sort of benefit from this. Class is the biggest factor in who gets to hold power, as evidenced by the fact that the current crop of politicians almost without exception went to expensive schools.

They do not work on behalf of men *or* women, they work on behalf of the people who help them get elected, either Unions or private donors, but either way, the votes come second to the money, and they work for the money.

As for social privilege, it's fairly obvious that this doesn't exist, given the fact that people are ""ironically"" making, buying, and wearing ""Male Tears"" stuff.

And if you believe men still have some sort of ""moral authority"", then how did they come by the label 'oppressor'?

Rape Culture. [I think RAINN said it best.](https://rainn.org/news-room/rainn-urges-white-house-task-force-to-overhaul-colleges-treatment-of-rape)

&gt; *In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming “rape culture” for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime*

Rape is considered a heinous crime in most societies, and is one of the most harshly punished in this one.

I think the Diving marshall is unacceptable, though I also think the Taxi Driver was mostly acting out of frustration - you can see him edging forwards when the marshall requests he waits for a space in the road (as is usual) because clearly, he doesn't understand that the road isn't just for motor vehicles and he sees the impediment as costing him money.

I'm in an awkward position by where I've voted for Labour in the past, and voted for the Conservatives the last two elections. I would label myself as a voter of policies, not a party voter.

I have a colleague who is out-and-out Tory. It is not just that he believes in some of the principles, he is actively against any form of social mobility. He believes increasing taxes on the rich irrefutably always causes an exit of wealth, and believes that any actual earnings go straight to welfare.

Ask him to prove any of this with figures and facts and you just get insults and hyperbole.

It happens, I've noticed it a lot more since that last election. It makes me feel a bit dirty for voting Conservative when I have to align with fucking idiots like that, who do not believe in any form of welfare and only support the Middle Class and above.

In fact, it's put me off voting Conservative in future.

&gt;FC Barcelona reserves the right to buy back the player during the first three years of the player’s contract and also has the right of first refusal for any possible future transfer.

Secondly, to get you really excited here's a rave review of the lad from Spanish football expert Graham Hunter I found on [Teamtalk](http://www.teamtalk.com/news/2483/9947405/Barcelona-s-Adama-Traore-close-to-joining-Aston-Villa):

&gt;""He has the potential to become an exceptional player,"" Hunter told Sky Sports News HQ.

&gt;""He is the kind of player which explain why people buy season tickets and why Sky have invested in the Premier League again. Okay, he's not English, he's from Spain and was born in Barcelona, but he's **frighteningly exciting**.

&gt;""He runs at players, gets past players and has the ability to do things that should be the provenance of a man of similar stature to Lionel Messi. But no, he's like a well-built middleweight boxer who is gifted and hugely thrilling and will unsettle defences.

&gt;""He is a player who can be something of a remedy over the duration of his contract, should he sign a three-year deal, because not only have Villa fans struggled with relegation but they haven't had enough excitement or the brand of football they want. Adama represents that in 24-carat ways.

&gt;""He is a beautiful talent and it is very exciting if he goes to Villa Park.""

If in fact his rant was about smokers, that he continuously said smoking was healthy, smoking was normal, everyone secretly likes smokers anyone who says they don't like smokers is lying to themselves, shot down on publicly funded radio anyone who disagreed with him, insulted various non smokers, said they were disgusting, they were ugly because they don't smoke, compared not smoking to having sex in public, supported and laughed with a caller who told a story about ""a big black African"" non smoker and how disgusting she was, said all non-smokers should be banned from going in public and forced indoors until they started smoking, said non smokers were only acceptable if they were sexually attractive so he could ogle them... This wasn't an ""i think"" this was a ""you all know i'm right and are just too afraid of being shunned to agree with me outright"" 

Yes I think there would be quite a public backlash actually. I think many non-smokers and smokers alike would be questioning what gives this guy the authority to state this on the BBC during the day, and to present it as fact. Everything I mentioned above was said during that show about breastfeeding mothers, a group who are protected from discrimination, who are probably some of the most vulnerable in society, who are sometimes under a lot of pressure to breastfeed and who are dealing with all manner of health issues in order to continue to breastfeed and do whats best for their child. 

His attitude reeked of misogyny and it was as if the whole show was done to make sure women knew their place, which was either indoors or with a sign around their neck warning others to stay away from them, unless they were good looking enough that men would actually want to look at their tits as they fed their child. 

This kind of attitude does nothing but shame new mothers and even if it puts one new mother off breastfeeding its potentially damaging to public health.

null,null,chickentrousers,null,null,null,"I dunno if I count, but I was a student in Aberystwyth and St Andrews, and I'm from Sheffield (I've also lived in *very* rural Georgia, but that's off topic). Obviously being a student is going to be different to living somewhere permanently. 

The main thing with Aber wasn't the countryside so much as the isolation. If you couldn't drive, it took you 4 hours to get to anywhere with a proper clothes shop or restaurant. It took 6 hours to get home. 

That said, it was astoundingly lovely. It was very friendly, utterly deserted at easter, and because it was a university town, you did get a lot of amenities and stuff you might not normally get in a small rural town - there's a cinema, and you got some pretty good gigs/shows on, there was an Aldi and Morrisons. That, and a beach, mountains to climb, everything within walking distance, meat to die for at the butchers and even the stuff from Morrisons was far better than anything else I've had and a crawling, crawling pace of life - which if you like it, it's awesome. After I finished university stuff, I got bored *very* quickly and decided to come home. My brother (we went to the same university. I know it's weird.) decided to go back and live there, and loves it, as he loves tramping around in the outdoors, going paintballing, disappearing off to Borth for an afternoon (I also suspect he's in denial about having to join the real world, but...)

The downsides are obviously students, for Aber in particular, but West Wales is full of awesome little places near the coast. Other downsides, apart from the isolation, is that it's... lovely in the summer. In the winter, the sea gets *brutal*, you live under a permanent raincloud and if the rain turns to snow? You might get stuck there because welsh roads are tiny and ambitiously labelled (my brother did once get stuck there when he was supposed to be coming home for Christmas).

You're treating a symptom and a condition as if they're the same thing. That is disingenuous. 

&gt;Do you honestly think that overweight people don't want to be thinner and that's why they're refusing help?

There is a minority of obese people who don't want to be thinner. Losing weight is hard work. You really think there are no people out there who would prefer to buy into the HAES bollocks and do nothing instead of taking the hard work option?

&gt;and


&gt;&gt;They most definitely are lazy. And selfish too

&gt;in the same paragraph? How am I supposed to discuss something with you if you say you don't think one thing then say you do three lines apart?

&gt;funny one to answer. I thought MW2 was the pinnacle too. BO1 and MW3 were great fun too, BO2 probably the best since MW2, Ghosts and AW were a bit of a disappointment.

I concur... i really hoped they could bring something extra to the table.. bigger maps ? more players ? nope they just perked and played to the stat padders. disapointing really but then again what can you do thats not been done in FPS ? I had MASSIVE hopes for BF2 after but that went the same way... smaller maps less people more stats and perks.

Each bank is different on how this works so your sister will need to contact them. Essentially she needs to say the account is in dispute.

Things to check:

How can the account be unfrozen. It's no good if the ex can just unfreeze it himself.

Will it affect any bills being paid, if applicable.

If wages are being paid into the account, move them! Get a new account asap.

As for the refunds, I don't know. It seems to me they shouldn't get involved in a dispute between 2 parties and just refund the money into the account/card it was paid from.

As for reclaiming any money, if the total value being claimed is less than 10K then it can be done through the small claims court - a court designed for people claiming without legal representation.

I've seen the figures for deaths related to nuclear power before and they are indeed very low compared to other fuel sources. But is it easy to measure? Radiation can kill people over an extended period of time. Fukushima leaked it's radioactive pools into the ocean and the fallout has likely spread across the world. A lot of people will likely have their health affected as a result. 

i would be much more pro nuclear power if I felt the safety regulations were severe enough for companies to care. BP knew that deepwater was fucked yet didn't do anything about it. Bhopal is another situation where the punishments just aren't severe or applied sufficiently to dissuade massive multinationals from cutting corners, especially when they spend so much on lobbying and thus influence. Our own government is currently working to limit air pollution regulations, less regulations mean less cost and therefore would be in the interest of nuclear energy companies.

Shock-horror-scandal! They've only gone and sacked our brilliant regular quizmaster and undercut him by hiring some fucking pub quiz company to come in and do it on the cheap!  
  
This merits a fucking rant.  
 Now I don't in all fairness have that much against pub-quiz companies. They are keeping a fantastic tradition alive, and bringing people in to drink in pubs rather than on the street or at home. Whatever that's pretty good.  
BUT it's undeniable that the best pub quizzes are those that are compiled by the quizmaster themselves, often with more interesting rounds or mechanics, so that the quiz really *feels* like THAT pub's quiz. Much more personal, completely unique.  
By all means the pub that my team (the glorious reich of Otto Von Quizmark) frequent is a pretty nice pub. PRETTY nice. It's not amazing. The mistake the management made there was thinking that the 5-odd regular teams who form the backbone of most the the quizzes there (often a few other teams in but it's us who are pretty much always there to bring some money in and fill the front room) go to that specific pub for the pub itself. No!  
We went because it's a nice pub with a bloody good quiz. Now it's a nice pub with a standard, run-of-the-mill, cookie-cut, ran in a bunch of different pubs quiz. There's nothing special about it!  
Well, we'll be back there next week to spend the bar tab that we won last night, but after the quiz had finished yesterday there was a hushed discussion in the smoking area between 4 of the 5 regular teams. One of them go way back with the old quizmaster, and we know he runs another 2-odd in the area. Looks like there's to be a bit of a putsch!  
Congratulations pub manager, you've just lost the vast majority of your regular teams! I hope the few quid you saved by hiring a slightly cheaper quiz company to run it makes up for the amount of money that 5 full tables bring in in drinks and snacks every week!  
Support pub quizzes, and more importantly support independently run quizzes, made with care by a quizmaster, not google searched by some company and handed off to one of their employees!

What does this mean? I'm saying that we wouldn't treat sufferers of other treatable disabilities this way, and that many (perhaps most?) obese people are sufferers of depression and anxiety

&gt;There is a minority of obese people who don't want to be thinner

I'd argue that this is such a minuscule number of obese people that it just isn't worth addressing at all. I'd also argue that these people have a body image problem similar to anorexia, and that they need help and treatment rather than abandonment. We shouldn't just treat all obese people the same regardless of the cause of their obesity.

&gt;Don't purposely misrepresent my argument

No, you are misrepresenting my argument, lets go back to what I was originally saying

&gt;People this overweight aren't just lazy. They are almost certainly suffering from mental illness in some way that causes them to eat so much and not exercise

To which you said

&gt;I'm not saying ""overweight people are lazy""

No-one was ever talking about all overweight people, just the overweight people effected by this change in policy. You referred to those people as

&gt;most definitely ... lazy. And selfish too

and you clarified that as meaning that

&gt;anyone who sees the problem their weight is causing and actively refuses to do anything about it because it's easier to do nothing and claim benefits is lazy and selfish

My point was that:

&gt;They are almost certainly suffering from mental illness in some way that causes them to eat so much and not exercise. We shouldn't give up on them as a society. We should be providing them with the money to keep them off the streets as well as making extra efforts to get them out of the rut they are stuck in.

I'm not quote mining, I was just pointing out that you said you don't think they're lazy, then you said they are lazy straight after. If you think they're lazy then that's fine although I disagree, and I don't see why being lazy should be punishable by cutting off the whopping £4000 maximum they are living on.

null,null,jdhan2006,lfc68,,null,"I think we can beat Arsenal.  Here is why.  

Everyone knows the formula to beating Arsenal.  1) Cede possession,2) line up defensively and 3) hit them on the counter / set pieces.  

1)  This will be the biggest obstacle.  BR has shown that he is able to change tactics and the brutal opening fixture list may make him more willing to get as many points as possible rather than focusing on getting the team to play a certain way.  But Liverpool have moved away from the possession obsession style they first played when BR first came in.  Now if they can focus more on not getting caught out and shutting down Arsenal's style they have a good chance of stifling anything they can try and put together.  

2)The 4-5-1 is perfect against the Arsenal 4-3-3.  Can and Henderson have the work rate and skills to clog the middle while the  wingers can help pin the Arsenal fullbacks from getting too deep into the attack.  From the first game it looks like Benteke isn't too good at pressing yet.  But hands down 9/10 times he will beat Koscielny or Mertesacker for headers.  So long balling him may yield some good results to keep them honest.  Also Benteke came from AV which played a counterattacking style which will be very useful if the press forces a turnover that Milner Can or Coutinho can turn into an opportunity.  

3)Although it was against lesser opponents the set pieces do look much better than last year.  Last season LFC sucked from set pieces.  Skrtel always has one in him for Arsenal from a corner, Lovren had a few chances in the preseason to make his mark and Benteke will be a pain in the ass for Arsenal to defend.

HOWEVER WITH SANTANDER if you do not tell the bank what to do with the money you pay they will automatically use it to reduce the monthly repayments, not the term as that gains them the most interest. That is what Santander stated to me on the phone when I phoned them up. They did not tell me I would have to either reduce my mortgage payments or reduce the term. 

Telling you you have to reduce the term usually implies they're expecting to alter the mortgage agreement.

1.Businesses will not get many orders from Just eat, if they do not offer a 20% discount on  food on top of the 12% commission and admin costs. So what is left for the businesses?

2.Restaurant industry is highly dependent on cashflow. Just eat holds their money for two weeks and release the payment only when the commission and admin costs are paid.

3.Too many business listings, leading to fewer orders per businesses. Not only that, Just eat has for a paid ranking system to get more orders.

To summarize, most of the restaurants and takeaways are not very happy to sacrifice their branding and profit for just eat, and hence so many of them have started giving Online Order experience to their customers in their own websites using latest technologies. Say for example http://al-aminkingston.co.uk/

Worth pointing out, marketing is not very costly and difficult as before due to the introduction of cheap facebook boost posts and google adwords.

To conclude, Just Eat had its significance when building and marketing an Ecommerce site was too complex and cost a fortune. Nowadays any programmer can build an Ecommerce website and write an iOS or Android app to ping the server for upcoming orders.

* If it is resold then this is clearly a net loss for the government.

* If it is passed down to the children of the owner then how can we be sure they needed a subsidised house anyway?

RTB is incredibly short sighted social housing will always be needed but RTB also assumes that the same families will always need it and simply gives them the house outright.

Not the case.

He wants us to be more willing to negotiate our way through problems, and that's commendable, but I do wonder if he ever thinks it's necessary to intervene in the world. If he said 'no', then that's a viewpoint, but I think he should be clear about it. Similarly, I have a nasty suspicion his foreign affairs policy will basically be shaped by the guilty feeling that whenever there are problems, somehow it must be Britain or Americas fault. Are we perfect? No. Have we messed up sometimes? Yes. Does that mean that the likes of Russia should be able to redraw the borders of independent sovereign states? I don't think so. Jaw Jaw is almost always better than War War, but at the end of the day, sending in tents, food and humanitarian aid won't stop Russian tanks or ISIS murderers.

Infinite Promotions is a family-friendly promotion, so there's no excess of weapons, blood etc. I think they were originally trying to go for an old-school *World of Sport* kind of vibe with certain matches having rounds and time limits, but the past few shows I've been to this has been less prevalent.

Our internet ran around £25pcm (Virgin Media) give or take a couple of pounds, electricity was £35pcm (First Utility), water was £150-£200 twice a year depending on usage, and council tax would have been ~£100pcm (Band B) if we hadn't both been students. Both students = no council tax, if only one of you is a student then you get a 25% discount. Either way make sure to send the council proof of your student status. 

That put our bills at around £100 per month on average, you should probably expect to pay around the same. Add ~£75 if only one of you is a student. I'd say this matches up with my renting experience in other parts of the south east as well - bills being £40-£60 per person per month without council tax, and around double that with council tax.

Middle earners are paying barely affordable rents and mortgages which in an age of precarious jobs puts them at risk. 

Building new social housing will increase the housing stock, increasing supply and suppressing some of the rises in costs, but I doubt it can solve the problem. We need to relax planning laws to allow for a vast quantity of new houses to be built. The overriding issue is how inelastic the housing market is to increases in demand. 

I don't see this as just a question of left and right. Right to buy has not helped but I don't believe it is the number one issue. House building was higher in the 1970s but dropped by around half by the end of the decade from where it has stayed pretty stable. Nowadays I blame nimbyism, wherever I have lived local councillors and politicians (Labour, Conservative, Lib Dem and Green) have fought tooth and nail to prevent large-scale housing schemes in their area.

Gazzetta dello Sport (closest paper to Milan) released the [yearly player salaries](http://www.rossoneriblog.com/2013/09/09/ac-milan-20132014-player-salaries-chart/) for 2013/14 and Balotelli was among the highest earners on €4,000,000 per year, which is only around €76k (£54k) per week if I calculated that right.

There are a few that I do and don't agree with. But then I've got strong feelings about what makes a ""sport"" and what makes an ""activity"" or something. I don't think of Golf as a sport, I think of it more as a leisure activity that people can just get really good at, which is good on them, but I don't consider it much more than that.  

I'd love surfing to be part of the Olympics, because surfing comps can be great fun and a real challenge, real skill and such, but equally that could well come under the leisure activity bit. There are professionals but mostly leisure.  

I think Climbing is the main sport I'd love to be part of the olympics. It has been short listed this year and while there would likely be some issues with the exact format, it'd be awesome. But that's because I love climbing.  

Which brings me handily on to the synchronized swimming and artistic/rhythmic gymnastics - they, like climbing, and a lot of the gymnastics, is about control of your body, physicality, physique, tehcnique etc, and I think that is worthy of being a sport.

“Your question about the bench. For some people it’s important. For others, it’s not It’s my decision”

“Dr Ferne and Dr Carneiro will not be on the bench, but doesn’t mean for rest of season.""

""I have seven assistants, only four can go on the bench. We have four kitmen, only one can come out. Important to be on the bench for some, for others is more important what they do, their contribution, what they do for the good of the team.

""I don't want to run away from the question. Jon Fearn and Carneiro will not be on the bench. They will not be on the bench on Sunday, it is my decision, my responsibility, but that does not mean it will be that way in the future.

""If you want to discuss football I am here, if you don't I am not.""

**Team news** : Oscar has picked up a knock apparently and is a doubt for the game on Sunday.


**Transfer news**: ""The club wants titles, the players want titles, the fans want titles. We are not top of the leauge in relation to the spenders it doesn't mean people have to be worried. The transfer window is not closed, secondly because you don't always have to be champion in the market and third, because we do things when we have to do, when we think we can do.

You posted a couple of weeks ago asking for help to learn how to ride, and several people offered to help you out or suggested that you should get a refresher. But you obviously haven't taken any of them up on that offer (me being one of them) or done a refresher. 

If you don't understand the basic mechanics of riding a bike PLEASE go get some more training before you go out on the road.  
People on the road are not going to give you the benefit of the doubt, or know why you're not properly in control of your bike. 

Riding is dangerous enough, don't add to that danger by not knowing what you're doing.

Please get some extra training. Apart from possibly hurting yourself, you're less likely to continue riding for years, thus denying yourself an amazing experience.

I say this because one of my riding buddies is a really poor rider and is on the verge of giving up. Primarily because he refuses to get some extra training (in fact someone's just paid for him to do a Bikesafe course because we don't want him to give up).",null,0,null,1439553094,null,null,false,0,cu2o5rj,null,t3_3gtzd7,null,null,null,t3_3gtzd7,null,null,null,1441244683,null,1,null,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null
null,null,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,null,"&gt;The implication that there are not 10 women in the country capable of taking the helm must be crazy.

I don't doubt there aren't 10 women in the current capable of it. I do, perhaps, doubt that those 10 women are elected MPs. I believe I asked you to name me some in another response, and I don't think you have?

Let's be clear, just because you're an MP, it doesn't mean you have ministerial talent. And that goes for the boys as much as the girls. 

&gt;If there are not 10 women in parliament of sufficient calibre then we have a broken democratic system that desperately needs fixing.

In what way do you mean? How do you fix it? If there are less women wanting to go in to politics, that doesn't necessarily mean that politics is sexist, it just means that women don't want to go in to it. Perhaps because they find a lot of it to be bollocks. Which a lot of it is (speaking from the point of view of someone who has a good political knowledge!).

&gt;This is a numbers game there are only a tiny number of elite positions of power and literally hundred of thousands of extremely talented people to fit them in that case it's easy to fill those positions with extremely talented individuals.

I don't want to blow my own trumpet, but I consider myself a talented individual (as does my employer, seemingly). I have no desire to enter politics though. I suspect many talented women will be the same.

&gt;What's currently happening is weaker individuals who look like their bosses are getting promoted its a well documented situation as is picking people with the same accent / school / political and religious inclinations.

There's an assertion, not a fact. I actually believe that female politicians do quite well out of the system as stands. I find them to be quite well represented on TV and the number of cabinet ministers does seem on the increase. I think Cameron has 9, including a female home secretary, which is one of the highest positions in the country.

&gt;I think this conversation has to start from the fact that we don't live in anything like a meritocracy. 

I'm not suggesting we do, but I don't think it's necessarily an anti-woman meritocracy. On the contrary, political parties are desperate to include more women to make them more electable. I think you're on the money with the accent/schooling etc etc arguments though.

But as I said, name me 10 women who you'd like to see in cabinet positions.

I know what we did. Much of it wasn't anything to be proud of, but to lay the blame wholly on colonisation is laughable. Plenty of countries have been through turmoil, sometimes occupied, yet African ones seem the most likely to never progress. 

Vietnam only finished 40 years ago, yet now it's one of the fastest growing economies in the world. It makes no sense to claim that colonisation, or conflict, *will* lead to poverty and desperation, as proven by countries like India, Malaysia and Canada. 

Your mindset is similar, although opposite, to someone who's proud that the Empire lead to the wealth created in Australia, New Zealand or Barbados. It's not strictly true, and it would be a folly to claim that there's wealth in some places purely because of the Empire; likewise it's wrong to claim that all of Africa's faults are because of British (and German, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, French and Belgian I presume?) colonisation. 

If you do want a simplistic, single scapegoat to point the finger at, you might be better by looking at a map of the World's religions, instead of a map the British Empire. It wouldn't tell the whole story, but I think it'd give a far more accurate portrayal of the root of the problems than what you currently seem to believe.

Some notes from my experience:

* aim to get to your train 10/15 minutes before it leaves to get a seat - I've only not got a seat twice and each time I was trying to get an earlier train than usual

* to follow on from this - the 7:15 and 7:45 (the two main commuter trains to KGX) both couple to a train from Ely - aim to get to the train before it couples (about 5 min before it leaves) to avoid a queue to get on

* only ever get the quarter past and quarter to the hour trains from KGX, the rest are too slow to bother with

* get a folding bike if you plan to cycle to the station, cuts down time locking it up and saves on costs of transport in London

* when it's sunny, try to sit on the right hand side of the train  (relative to the motion of the train) for both journies as there's no air-con and it can become uncomfortably hot

* buy a year long season ticket - expensive, but cheaper in the long run and saves on hassle (plus there are other [benefits](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/ticket_types/46573.aspx) to having a gold card) - my work gets me an interest free loan to cover the cost, but I think if I bought it on my credit card, the monthly payments+interest are still cheaper than buying it on a monthly basis (this depends on your own credit card rates mind)

I don't think you understand what a meritocracy is. It doesn't mean you can't have two brothers. Would many doubt that the Miliband brothers were some of Labour's most competent performers? Would you have preferred Diane Abbott, who stood that time round (the answer's no, by the way).

&gt;And it chose at totally unsuitable candidate. 

That has nothing to do with whether or not it was meritocratic. Ed was chosen at the point in time because the people choosing him felt him to be the best candidate. That that turned out not to be the case doesn't change that.

&gt;Beyond that, you notice labour MPs are mostly pretty weird, and the party culture is pretty weird. If you look at other parties, even the conservatives, the MPs seem more human, and they don't seem obliged to pretend so much. 

I find that comment bizarre. They're just better at performing. I don't think Miliband was weird. I think he was just a human being and was portrayed as weird by the media.

That's why I have all this partisan bullshit. Reds spend all their times blaming the blues, the blues spend all their time blaming the reds, and the ones in power - regardless of colour - do the exact same crap.

Yes, the Tories introduced it. Yes Labour kept it in place and encouraged it. Instead of measuring dicks to see who is marginally more to blame, how about people shut the fuck up and focus on the problem instead.

Yes, Right to buy has been a complete disaster and completely harmful to the country. My scumbag uncle who never worked a fucking day in his life got an expensive central London house handed to him on a silver platter which he flipped for a giant pile of cash the second he could and moved elsewhere in the country and lives a very comfortable life. Better than most of his hard working siblings. The tax payer lose, the government purse loses, the people in need of social housing (of which there is now 1 less) lose out. Nobody gained but him.

We need to be saving that money and spending it on housing instead of handing over £000s to people who didn't earn it.

We need to tighten regulations on house sizes - no that room that's too small to fit a bed in isn't a bedroom, it's a cupboard.

We need to reduce net immigration - if we don't have enough affordable houses for the people already here why the fuck are we letting even more in?

We need to ensure that the right people are in the right social housing - my aforementioned uncle lived in a 4 bedroom house - because he 'inherited it' from my grandparents, who had 9 children. Had the under-occupancy charge existed a decade or two ago he'd have been forced out into something smaller so at least when he was given a free house it was a less expensive one.

We need to be smarter where we build the houses. The population in my town has skyrocketed the last decade or so and is planned to expand even faster. Yet there are fewer industries and actually less infrastructure to support that population than there used to be. Meanwhile the various governments continue to encourage more and more economical development in London and house prices there go ever higher due to demand from all those workers...",null,0,null,1439554279,null,null,false,0,cu2ok8a,null,t3_3gy4oh,null,null,null,t1_cu2lww4,null,null,null,1441244873,null,4,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Those who were sent in to clean up immediately after Chernobyl without any protection or knowledge of the dangers they faced got a massive dose of radiation and died within days.

Dose is the main factor in health affects, with anything over 100 mSv being clearly linked to adverse effects but there have been cases of people getting larger doses and being fine.

It's a lot harder to work out deaths as a consequence of radiation over a long period of time as there are so many different variables at play. On a cellular level, radiation can kill a cell, damage it irreparably, damage it but then have the damage repaired or not do anything at all. Cancers will only occur as a result of un-repaired damage and even then some mutations can be harmless.
Additionally it's hard to tell if a cancer was due to radiation or not as people's lifestyles and genetics vary significantly. You've also got the issue of medicine progressing so cancer has become the biggest killer due to most other diseases being eradicated or treatable, yet a cancer could be developed in someone exposed to radiation that it unrelated to that exposure. You're also going to find more cases of cancer when you go out looking for them than would be reported otherwise as small benign ones will be detected. The whole issue is very complex and so it's impossible to put an exact figure on anything which is why you'll see such variance in the numbers different organisations quote. 

[The Chernobyl tissue bank at Imperial College London](http://www.chernobyltissuebank.com/) has done a lot of research into the effects of exposure and the numbers of people affected. I've been to a couple of lectures given by one of the researchers at the bank who's a biologist, so unbiased towards the nuclear industry and she's said that the large death tolls are vastly exaggerated and unproven.

As for Fukushima, the releases were far lower than Chernobyl mainly due to them having a containment building as opposed to a glorified shed surrounding the reactor.

They don't expect any radiation related deaths from the accident at Fukushima, it was only the immediate area which was affected and radiation levels there are now at safe levels, it was a much smaller accident than Chernobyl. The [wikipedia article is pretty informative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_effects_from_the_Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster).

I don't know about penalties but I really hope that TEPCO and its management were punished, the whole organisation had a terrible record even prior to Fukushima. It's disgraceful to everyone involved that they were allowed to proceed for so long without anything being done.

null,null,E_mE,eu,"Berlin, DE",null,"&gt; Class is the biggest factor in who gets to hold power, as evidenced by the fact that the current crop of politicians almost without exception went to expensive schools.

Yes this is totally true, but the fact that most of the rich people of power just happen to be men, which then carry on the (Historical) Patriarchal system in the political and social context. Even though women tend to leave education with far better grades in most cases. Also, what about privately educated women, don't seem to see too many of them in positions of power. I like Corbyn's approach here to make sure his cabinet (Shadow) will be half women and men, which helps to reduce the problem at least the chambers of power on the opposition.

Personally I don't think any of these people should hold power, as power needs to be justified which in this case it isn't so should be dismantled, which in hand will resolve some of the gender equality issues too because people wouldn't complain about unbalanced power between genders. But the power issue is a different argument which I hold quite anarchist ideals towards. 

&gt; Rape is considered a heinous crime in most societies, and is one of the most harshly punished in this one.

Indeed your right, but I think the problem with this is the amount of times women are either too scared to come forward or are scared of being ignored by the authorities, which does appear to happen tad too often. And of course there are exceptions to this as there are arseholes and idiots in both genders. 

&gt; Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions

I disagree with this statement, you can often hear men whistling at women,  taunting them in the street or accusing them if dressing inappropriately, that means they want to seduced or so. I think a primary focus on feminist movements is to dismantle this mentality in men so they generally feel safer. Also it seems that when men attack women somehow, it's generally with sexual connotations which demonstrates the sexist and patriarchal attitude towards women. I know many female friends who regularly get taunted or harassed for nothing more than being female and that some men think they can have it their way.  

&gt; women have an effect on men 

Can you please elaborate on this?

And yes, the system and problems are very complex, but if we dismantle more of the power bases which allow it to perpetuate, we start to resolve more of the cultural and political problems that exist. But yes there is far more that needs to be dismantled.

I think she should get in touch with her ex-fiance and start negotiations. Is a 50% split reasonable? It depends what each party put in to start with, so perhaps that can be negotiated too.

Of course the situation will be acrimonious but it is probably a good idea not to threaten small claims court action immediately. However, your sister may have to do so eventually - patience is key here. My experience of threatening court action is that it is important to be calm and measured in all communications - I had someone back down recently because I didn't lose my temper. Remember that all written correspondences (text, email, written) will likely need to be presented before a judge.

Lol, funny that you should use those examples, Australia, Canada and the USA all gained independence from the UK. But to take your point seriously, England already has the upper hand. The UK gets more in taxes from Scotland than it gives back. Wales is probably subsidised because there's no coal any more, but Scotland has a healthy export industry and ranks 14th in the world for GDP per capita, whereas the UK would be 18th http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0044/00446013.pdf

If you really want things to be fair stop stealing money from the Scots.

null,null,Patch86UK,null,Labour Member,null,"Once again, that's exactly what Corbyn and his allies in parliament have been doing to other leaders of the Labour Party- why was it OK then and not now?

Since 1997, Corbyn has rebelled on 500 votes, an average of 140 every 5 years. He has been joined in this by his like minded MPs in the SCG. When rebelling against Blair, he was rebelling against someone who had been elected by a landslide by both the general public (in the general elections) and by the Labour Party membership. The argument is presumably that it's OK to try to sabotage your leader if you think you know better.

If Corbyn is elected, the Blairites in the PLP might choose to do the same. The difference is, there are more of them than there has been in Corbyn's faction, and they might have enough to defeat bills they don't like. Why shouldn't they vote against their leader, as Corbyn has in the past, every time they think they know better? Is it reasonable that Corbyn might expect 140 bills of his to be shot down by those who see the world differently? If Corbyn wasn't expelled or vilified for voting against the leadership so often, why should he treat his fellow MPs differently?

Basically, you can't have it both ways. Either it's OK for MPs to vote with their conscience and do their own thing, or you expect MPs to shelve their own opinions and do as their elected leader tells them. Corbyn appears to have demonstrated which approach he considers legitimate, so we can hardly complain now if others follow his lead.",null,0,null,1439555636,null,null,false,0,cu2p2jn,null,t3_3gpx51,null,null,null,t1_cu0n8un,null,null,null,1441245112,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null
