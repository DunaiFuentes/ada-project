You'd think that wouldn't you? I've had first-hand experience and I can tell you that for most people, this isn't how they bet.

I've done some work taking surveys in betting shops. Less than 10% of the people in there bet more than £5 at a time. There's maybe two or three people per day who will come in for half an hour, bet a few £50+ bets, and leave.

The vast majority are old people, mostly ladies, with nothing else to do. They go to these bettings shops for company. And the free tea and biscuits. They want to spend as long as possible there, and so they spend hours and hours making 10 or 20p bets. Once I saw a woman stay there for my entire 8 hour shift who, aside from a single £1 bet, was only making 10p bets. I've had several people make complaints about the fact that there were too few 10p stake machines.

&gt; And finally, on higher education, the report finds broadly similar attitudes to tuition fees north and south of the border. Crucially, the comparison work highlights that a clear majority of Scottish voters thinks some or all students and families should pay towards or pay for all of their tuition.

&gt; 9% of Scots believe that all students or their families should pay their university fees, compared with 11% in England; while 64% said some students or their families should pay, compared with 67% in England.

&gt; These figures had increased by a few percentage points for both Scottish and English voters from when the question had been previously asked in 2007. So support for (some) payment of tuition fees has in fact marginally increased since their abolition in Scotland in 2000.

Your personal perception may be different - but actual studied opinions are not so radical as you think.

I bought my first thing for months in there today, it was a magazine which I could have easily bought in Tesco, I just happened to be near a WHSmith instead. Used to be that you could only get some of the magazines in WHSmith, now it seems that every supermarket has a better selection.

They had an upstairs section with stationery, toys and DVDs. There was literally no-one up there except me. Not even someone on the till. At one point I was questioning whether the upstairs was closed and I hadn't noticed the signs.

Went to look at books in the ""transport and history"" section because I'm interested in aircraft. Got faced with a load of Tom Clancy rip-offs. Surely ""transport and history"" section would suggest non-fiction!?

Even when I paid using the automated cashier, why is it that they have to ask if I want promotional items? If I wanted a bottle of water I'd have bought a bottle of fucking water. Then they want to charge me (1p, admittedly) to take a plastic bag!? Everywhere else just gives the damn things away.

Honestly I think if we can get the depth that we were obviously lacking in areas last year sorted maybe sell some deadwood and loan out some youngsters to give them a full season to see how they do I think we could be in for an exciting season. Really it all hinges on the first 10 games unfortunately as we all know that a good Everton start is a thing of myth and legend akin to Bigfoot. If we can win or draw a respectable amount of those games then we'll breeze through Christmas and onwards to a good finish. Think Champions League is far too optimistic but a Europa spot should be the aim. Hopefully a cup run too I'd love to see us win a cup for the first time. 


I think it's going to be a huge season for many players. In my opinion it'll be huge for Stones, Cleverley, Barkley, Deulofeu and Lukaku. It'll be Stones' first season as first choice centre back which is far overdue and he'll be out to prove why he deserves it and show he's one of the best in the country. Clevs will look to get past the boo boys and show why Alex Ferguson rated him so highly as well as why Roberto had faith to bring him in. Think he'll do very well for us in my opinion he's number 2 centre midfielder behind McCarthy. Barkley is obvious because he has a point to prove. He'll look to prove why he was rated so highly the season before last and find that form again. I'm sure he'll be thinking and this is no offence that he'll want to be remembered like Gazza rather that Osman. Definitely a huge season for him. Deulofeu is coming off a slightly unimpressive season in La Liga and he'll want to repay the club and fans for accepting and loving him so much unlike they did at Sevilla. He'll want to show that he can do it on the big stage and why he was one of La Masia's top talents and even perhaps try to get back into the Spain squad. And finally Rom who'll want to become one of the best strikers in the league. He had an impressive goal tally last year in all competitions especially when u take into account his poor form at the start of the season. He'll definitely want to be up there challenging for the golden boot this year and he'll also want to cement his place as first choice striker in the Belgium national team because Benteke is going to some other club that are seen as big or whatever? Who knows? But with the additions of Deulofeu and even Cleverley along with Barkley trying to rediscover his best form Rom should have plenty oppurtunities to add to his goals tally.

It is true as you say that there are other differences: some people are richer, some more powerful and some have influential friends. And certainly people born in more favourable situations will have more chances of becoming head of state. But just because there is not enough social mobility, you shouldn't think that a monarchy is appropriate. 

But symbols still matter, and in a monarchy civilian life is enveloped in a legal framework which guarantees the position to the member of one family, they are kings and all the rest owe them deference. In a monarchy, children are born who are by law your betters. People are reminded to know their place. 

In a republic, by contrast, there is a framework of equality. This form of constitution encourages anyone to be the head of state. Citizens of a republic, if I can speculate here, are less likely to keep their heads down than subjects of a monarchy.

null,false,SleepingFish,null,null,null,"Zabaleta was the best right back in 2014, and a key underrated reason why City have been good over the past few seasons and why they won the league. He scores, assists and is an absolute solid defender. 

I'll probably be down voted in this and last few comments just because I'm not saying our players are the best. But I genuinely think Zabaleta has been the better right back than Clyne. Zabaleta, and a lot of City's squad are aging though and therefore Clyne will be better probably next season. The fact remains Zabaleta would still get in our team.

As for Fernando/Fernandinho, they're good at their jobs. Apples and oranges as you said. But they'd still get in our team if we were needing that sort of performance. Not to mention that Dzeko and Jovetic would probably start for us too, considering we've been linked with both in the past.

Finally you can't leave Sterling out if you are including Milner (and Firmino). 

However I do agree that City are the most vulnerable of the Top 4. They need serious investment both in quality and quantity, and you can't go splashing £49m on every player, which is why they went for Delph for, what, £7m.

The first rate rise will be small and it will send a shock and cause a bit of panic. 

Lots of stupid households have spent the extra disposable income they got from very low mortgage rates on cars too expensive, run up debts buying things they shouldn't and will struggle.

Lots of other households will have been hurt by the public sector pay freezes.

A few households have been barely getting by, just about keeping the wolves from the door and a rate rise won't tip them over the edge but it'll have a big psychological effect and may demoralise them to give up.

Full disclosure: I am one of the 17,000 people who joined the Liberal Democrats after the election. I've never been a member of a political party before and consider myself 'politically pragmatic'. I do hold strong liberal values, however, and with a number of authoritarian Conservative policies in the works I thought it important to start standing up for what I believe in. 

We live in uncertain times. The Labour Party are likely to be impotent for the next 5 years and are mired in infighting. They are also too concerned with following the Conservative Party's political weather - Indeed, it's uncertain exactly what policies their new leader will stand on. The Lib Dems are the alternative. 

If you would be interested in joining the Liberal Democrats, you can do so for as little as £12 a year if you're 26 or older, or £1 a year if you're younger or a student. Maybe it's worth considering?

null,false,gsloup20,null,null,null,"&gt;Just don't do silly things like claim to be Irish because someone you are distantly related to emigrated to the US as a child.

I think this stems from the lack of a long-lasting culture in America.  The U.S. is such a new country with an assortment of people that many will look for a larger identity when trying to discover their own roots.  Hearing how my great-great grandpa came over from Czechoslovakia was something very intriguing and helped me identify my own family history.  Obviously, I'm not going to go into the Czech Republic or Slovakia and claim to be ""one of them,"" but I do definitely see why Americans say these sorts of things.  We really look up to our ancestral homelands since we find it interesting to see where we may have been born if our ancestors never left.  **HOWEVER**, I do see how hearing such comments from tourists can seem odd or annoying, and I'll definitely refrain from saying these sorts of things.

&gt; don't complain about things not be like they are in America, don't assume that things work the same, and don't assume that our cultures are the same.

That seems to be a big problem with U.S. society.  We tend to have very ethnocentric points of view and it really shows-- especially here on Reddit (e.g. /r/askreddit threads centered all around the U.S.).

&gt;race isn't such a big deal here

Most people I know don't tend to make a huge deal out of race.  I think the vocal ones tend to blow things way out of proportion and the media puts this issue under the microscope to further the problem.

Thanks for all the advice!

At this point, ""Dembele doesn't make clever passes"" is a dominant narrative and people seem to simply not see the intelligent passes he does make.   But people see what they want/expect to see.  I do look for them, and I see plenty of them.  

For instance, against Palace away, we scored but one goal, and Dembele created it with [this pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD-pkX-Y7O0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4s), but no one acknowledged it in either the post-match thread or the MotM thread.  Not a single person.  It was all the usual ""can't play a productive pass"" and ""horribly indirect"" and such.  Dembele was actually one of the few bright spots that match, but people just don't see it, or choose not to.

And of course, he makes the occasional [stupidly skillful pass](http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/mousa-dembele-pulled-off-a-great-back-heel-pass-during-spurs-win-over-newcastle-gif/) , too, but that's not really the point here.

It seems like I'm cherry-picking here, but that's because Mousa tends not to get assists, his best passes happen in the buildup, and highlights of those are hard to find.  But they're there, and he makes a fair few of them just about every time he plays.  

EDIT: typos

null,false,TheBlueNomad,null,null,null,"It depends on many factors for a manager at a big club to promote youngsters. Stability of the Club in that period of time, the talent of the team as a whole(with top class players, you can risk playing one or two youth players alongside them), expectations/vision of the board or owner and the talent of that given youth player. Almost all managers would play them, if they are truly gifted players. When Jose first came, we were after a short term success. We needed to win major trophies in a very short period of time. He didn't have the luxury for trial and errors. As we all know, you can't win major trophies consistently with youngsters. Just look at how Arsenal have struggled in the past decade or so. They relied heavily on youth instead of more polished/experienced top class players and they paid the price (in severe drought, eternal bliss for others though!). At the moment, we are in a better place. The Club is more stable and our manager is not under a big pressure to win major trophies every season. We have a strong balanced team. I honestly believe, we now have the luxury to slowly blood in one or two youngsters almost every season. This season, i expect RLC to play few matches here and there. Cups games, few minutes in matches we running riot and also in the last matches of the UCL group stages. That is, if we are already going through to next round. I won't be surprised, if he ends up playing something like 20 games. I know Zouma has played in France, but how many of us here expected he would end up playing that many games for us last season? RLC has a chance this season just like Zouma did last season. As much as people like mentioning we don't promote youngsters, how many of those past youth players were good enough to be part of our team? It is only now that we are producing some of the very best youth players in the world. 
Btw, we are now considered to be one of the most stable teams in Europe. That must have really hurt Arsenal fans and their board.

null,false,ctni,null,null,null,"Chobham street and a few others. But don't confuse criticism of the badly managed ones for criticism of all bonfires. It's like taking criticism of badly behaved bands as criticism of all orange parades. It doesn't help your cause.

The leaflets created a fiction that yourself and other loyalists seem happy to toe the line of - that alliance was pulling down the flag as part of its own little project (I doubt it would have been touched had sinn fein not made it an issue - no one was really complaining about it), and that it was something to do with Mrs Long (it was a BCC decision, nothing to do with the MP or her term in East Belfast). So yes, I think it would have made a bit of a difference.

Even Peter Robinson said he regretted it (Briefly). Would there have been unrest regardless? Probably, it's NI. But EB would have been spared the brunt of it. It also has added to this further fiction that there is some sort of 'war' against loyalism. Or that any time Alliance, or any one else for that matter, shows concern,or wants something better, that it is an outright 'attack' on loyalism.

One large section of the divide doesn't trust Alliance and there is no working relationship? Don't buy that at all. Its a small subsection. Either way, Alliance seem perfectly willing to work with them, not dismiss them out of hand. Now, I dont know and am not in the position to find out the on the ground situation with the mlas and councellors in more loyalist areas, but they way I see it, If there is a trust problem, if there is something stopping some loyalists from working with alliance where appropriate , it's coming from the whispering from the sinister underbelly of unionism that are frightened of alliance, saying ""They're themmuns, attack them, they aren't pro union, everything they do is anti union"". See some of the outright sneering that occurred on TV during the election. 

Although thankfully the number who take it on board and won't trust alliance no matter seems small. Not large, as you assert. Same with the bonfire crowd who won't listen to anyone's requests to tone things down a little. Unfortunately, they have political cover to to what they want and ruin it for everyone else thanks to one large party in particular refusing to speak out against their behaviour. So at Chobham street there they are refusing to listen to anyone, because one person refusing to speak out until after the fact gave them cover. I can criticise unionist politicians because they *are* the vacuum. They are preventing anyone else, in this case even the UUP, from stepping in and effecting change. 

Luckily, in most areas the council funding and assistance seems to have closed the gap and lead to a decently run event. But if the local leadership fails, then we can easily get another Chobham street. In fact, it's more likely now that someone's been allowed to get away with it once.

Would I be accepted if I went to a bonfire and said I'd like to observe? Actually, I think 95% of the people there would be welcoming, however strongly loyalist they were. That 5% that would take a swing at me that unfortunately would stop me going (alone, at least). That other 95% I could have a perfectly good working relationship with. The trouble again, is that there is someone out there painting me as an enemy and giving them the 'justification' they need to hate me. The sooner we can get rid of this kind of behaviour in NI politics the better.

If there was a battle with loyalism there would be attempts to ban the orange order and bonfires entirely from alliances side. I don't see that. I have not heard any remote murmurings of that at any alliance event I've been to. This one sided thing is again, a fiction. An utter delusion of constantly being attacked. And that's going to be a self inflicted shotgun to the foot in the long run.

I haven't yet had the opportunity to vote on party policy, but should I get the chance I would certainly vote against any attempt to even move in an overtly anti orange direction. The ideal is to gently convince people into the middle ground and provide space for the cultures to grow in a positive way, not attack or destroy them.

Also: I'm not Alliance. I'm an (opinionated) individual and commentator who is a member and a supporter.

Benteke in the line up changes, drastically, how you have to defend Liverpool.  He must be closely defended by at least two players freeing up an attacking player somewhere.  Lallana makes the most of the space provided from that scheme.

There was a period in Northern Ireland from 1968 to 1998 known as the troubles which consisted of religiously fueled political violence between those who wanted a united Ireland (mostly catholic) and those who wanted to stay in the UK (mostly protestant). 

There were a few thousand deaths, and tens of thousands of injuries. There was also a number of terrorist attacks by the unionist Irish in the UK (such as a mortar attack on downing Street, bombings in UK cities and massacres, aimed at civilians), and some atrocities committed by British forces and paramilitary forces on both sides. Often this fighting spilled into the Republic of Ireland, and the RoI supported the unionists. 

The Good Friday Agreement ended the fighting, and set up a fairer governance over Northern Ireland.

Anglo-Irish relations now are fairly good, however things can sometimes be a little tense. Obviously it hasn't been long, and it is still fresh in some people's minds.

Another one would be learning Primavera and becoming a project planner. A lot of engineering and construction  companies take on apprentices and you'd have a leg up with a Primavera qualification. Experienced planners make £50 an hour easy but that's with 10 years experience.

If you would rather not work in an office then I'd recommend welding in terms of work available. There's always work for welders as far as I can tell. I mean industrial welding not small time fixing stuff welding. Like working as a welder on an oil refinery or something you'd make a decent living £40k annually plus, no question.

Gist of it was: 

* Yeah, I wasn't specifically referring to you when I mentioned the more extreme ""he doesn't pass forward"" comments.
* Much of the difference in ""ambitious"" passing between Dembele and Mason is due to their respective positions.  Mason takes the ball from deep, and often looks to make long, risky passes to bypass the defense or switch the field.  Dembele mostly played CAM, so he gets the ball when he's further forward and the defense has had more of a chancce to set itself, and thus he tends to make shorter passes into feet in the center (where all our AMs like to congregate) or flip it out to the near wing to make space in the center.
* Most of Moose's appearances last season were as a substitute, so he wasn't in the flow of the game, he was passing to tired teammates, and he was often tasked with holding a lead.
* Stats aren't the final word, but here are some fun facts I just looked up: 
     * In matches he *started*, Dembele averaged 1.9 key passes/90.  Not too shabby.  For comparison, Lamela averaged 2.1, Eriksen 2.2, and Cesc Fabregas 2.8.  Mason only averaged 1.
     * When starting *in attacking midfield*, Dembele averaged 2.8 kp/90, whereas Eriksen and Lamela both averaged 2.2.  But now we're getting into small sample size territory with Mousa.
     * Stats courtesy of whoscored.com.
*  Shit.  This is still pretty damn long, even on a condensed re-write.

Just the games he plays and for who. A player could be sold 10 times in 2 windows. But he can only play for 2 of those clubs during that 'season.' 

So, in this setup, Atleti could loan him to somebody until December 31. And as long as he doesn't play a competitive game for Atleti then the club who loaned him (please be us!) will count as 'Club 1'.

And in Jan, when Barca sign him, they become 'Club 2'. Player leaves club one at the end of the year/start of the window, and signs/plays for Club 2.

But... I take most of this info from SSN, Champo (Football Manager for you kids...) and the usual January window rumour excuses.

But, (WARNING!: DAILY MAIL LINK!!! DONT LOOK AT THE SIDE INFO/STORY BARS!) here is a story about [Nicky Shorey and the 3 club rule from 5 years ago.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1248600/Fulhams-Nicky-Shorey-FIFA-probe-playing-club-season.html) which is the most relevant thing I can find to back up my '2 club' theory...

And yet statistically Mason beat Dembele in just about every stat bar passing% and that's probably because Dembele always looks for a safe (and mostly non threatening) pass.

Something people overlook is that Mason was one of our best defensive players last season. Which is a good thing considering he was playing along side Bentaleb in a position we all agree requires a good defensive player.

Now I'm not saying Mason is the right player to play alongside Bentaleb. But when you consider he was asked to do a job (one which he's not really known for as a more attacking player) and he did it better than anyone else in the team, I really don't think he deserves the stick he gets from a lot of people.

People talk about how good we'll look with a proper DM playing alongside Bentaleb, but I dare say Mason would look a lot better playing alongside a pure DM as well.

You didn't indicate if you had watched any New Who so if you have a favorite Classic Who Doctor that might be a good starting point. For most of us that will be the first Doctor that we watched (for me its #3 – Pertwee). Or you can start with the best rated episodes/story arcs for each Classic Doctor.

You can put something like “where to start watching Classic Who” or “watch Classic Who” or “best episodes of Classic Who” in the search box for /r/doctorwho and for /r/gallifrey. You’ll find various posts asking about where to find classic episode, what to watch/not watch, and in what order to watch them. You will find much more in-depth discussion of Classic Who on /r/gallifrey and /r/classicwho than on /r/doctorwho.

As already noted, you can go /r/gallifreylive and look at the various discussion threads. Each one has the 4-5 episodes of a story arc for a particular Doctor that can be viewed online.

A listing of which episodes are rated best to watch can also be found in the FAQ section of /r/doctorwho. Check out the Related Reddits/FAQ link under the New Users Must Read header on the right side of the main page (and the similar subreddits link on the /r/gallifrey main page).

There are a lot of episodes on YouTube. BBC Classic Doctor Who on YouTube has playlists for the Classic Doctors.
https://www.youtube.com/BBCClassicDoctorWho

ITunes and myretrotv.com have classic episodes available through subscription. Amazon and eBay should have (or used to have) complete seasons/series sets for all of the Doctors on DVD (minus the missing episodes for Doctors #1 and #2). There are a lot of Doctor Who related online sites that can be googled for subscription service or DVD sets purchase. With DVD's check for zone compatibility and ensure they are official recordings not re-recorded products.

Edit: While the BBC Classic Doctor Who link above works it has ""regenerated"" into the BBC Offical Doctor Who YouTube link. It's has Classic and New Who but seems to be have more features about events, podcasts and video clips than full episodes.

Went into the branch as well as I didn't think it could harm. The branch staff basically accused me, saying that I'd obviously given my details to someone or that I'd made the transaction myself! 

To cut a long story short, I got money back on the 2nd January after midday. Which was lucky because although most of my bills are due on the 1st, because of the fall of the weekend, they were due on the 3rd. 

To top it all off NatWest charged me for going over my overdraft limit! 

I wrote a letter of complaint and for notification back from an internal investigator saying he was looking into it. Eventually, like 4 weeks later, he got back to me saying that they didn't know why it had happened but here's £50 for the troubles and I could take it further (ombudsman) but if I did, I wouldn't get the £50. 

I was happy with the £50, but in hindsight, I really should have gone further. ",null,0,null,1437111107,null,0,false,0,ct69ric,null,t3_3djadw,null,t1_ct69ric,null,t3_3djadw,null,null,null,1437926174,null,15,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,15,null

We have an unelected head of state who actually does the job properly. Sure they were 'forced' upon us but they're actually doing good for the country, giving us a positive image worldwide, bringing in tourism and then doing the job of embodying the nation. Meanwhile we have an '*elected'* head of government  in a countrywide popularity contest that is less about doing the job than it is turning up every 5 years to promise things that will barely ever happen and even when they do there's always some added caveat that doesn't actually do what the law is supposed to.

Meanwhile someone gives you a juicy green Granny Smiths and you complain because you didn't choose it. Be careful, be very careful what you wish for.

null,false,cac2008,eng-middlesex,Middlesex,null,"I've always said that all this obsession over house prices is hiding the true problem: rental prices.

It also demonstrates that sonething is horribly unbalanced in the housing market. Higher rental prices mean that less people can save for a deposit, so the demand is depressed. Under an 'invisible hand' this should make the prices fall... Yet they are yet again going through the roof.

My opinion is that it is housing developers that are to blame for the London house price, as new builds aren't priced for the average person anymore. They are priced for an investor to purchase, never have anyone actually live in it (that would potentially lower the value) and then sell when the price rises. It's creating a bubble which the government seems afraid to tackle, as after all if action was taken to stabilise or lower the price, it would also lower house prices of the retired baby boomers, who are a sizeable fraction of the voting population. Take a new build in Southwark that I've seen go up. They are marketed as 'ideal for first-time buyers' yet a single bed flat in the complex costs £1.25m. 

My ideas for resolution? I have three that may have an impact:

* Split the market somehow. Have properties over £750k as counted in a 'premium market'. Yes its artificial, but change regulation so that they are marketed differently, listed differently, taxed differently etc. this will allow premium properties to be traded to the right people openly (so that they stop the damned lies of 'for first time buyers') whilst still allowing the properties for the normal person to grow at a reasonable rate whilst being affordable. Yes the price for standard properties would initially fall as the price stabilises to what it should have been in the first place: that's the hope anyway!

* change taxation, increasing the tax burden for mortgages on properties over a certain value (based on property value, not mortgage principle), and increasing capital gains tax for properties. The aim here is to make properties unwelcome as investments.

* increase the cost of keeping a property empty. This can be done via taxes, stopping the council tax reduction for unoccupied properties and/or introducing new taxes to disincentivise this behaviour.

It would be my hope that combined with our economy improving (making other investments an option again; the bond market is shit at the mo) this would increase the number of properties in the normal market for the average person, allowing the price to return to a reasonable and balanced value.",null,0,null,1437115191,null,0,false,0,ct6b7nl,null,t3_3dj8xu,null,t1_ct6b7nl,null,t3_3dj8xu,null,null,null,1437927336,null,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22,null

This is so stupid i dont even know where to begin. Struggled going forward? We had the 2nd best offense in the pl last year, best since before new years, and have 2 players in the top 10 top goal scoreres of the league.

Oscar doesnt cut it most of the time? He was injured and out of form most of the second half of the season, which, coincidentally, was the only time we weren't banging in goals left and right. He was one of our best players 1st half of the season. 

Cuadrado is a flop? He's barely played, give him time. He was great in the wc and from the few copa games i saw, he was good there too. He needs time to settle.

* MPs [voted on](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23892783) military action against the Syrian national government - which seems to have come down to not wanting another Iraq. Iirc, part of the concern at the time with attacking the government was that the UK would be helping some of the more oppressive rebel groups in the region, including Isil - back before it was a household name.

* the UK military isn't directly engaged in air strikes. Sort of. These pilots are attached to other air forces (presumably through Nato stuff?); so probably serving under their command. I guess it is something like the RAF loaning the USAF a pilot and support crew to help the air forces work better together or something like that.

* the vote by MPs wasn't binding. The UK Government (Prime Minister, MoD etc.) has the legal authority to go to war or take any military action it wants to (due to powers coming from the divine right of kings). The MPs were just asked as a courtesy; and the Government was surprised by the result.

Interestingly, back in the 90s, there was a bill proposed that would have prevented the Government taking military action against Iraq without the explicit approval of the House of Commons. It is one of the rare, recent examples of the Government vetoing a bill to prevent it being debated, never mind voted on.

- Be polite, yeah it's a trope that British people are always apologising for no good reason and say please and thanks for everything. I'm sorry, but it's true though. It's appreciated.

- We queue for things a lot, buses, icecream, etc. Join in the queue, make small talk with the people you're with. It's cool.

- Pubs/bars. There is an order of service at the bar of who has been waiting longest. It's rare to stay at the bar with your drink after ordering (see that a lot in US TV, don't know if that's actually a thing).

- You can't smoke inside a public building. This means, pubs, clubs, cafes, restaurants, etc. It's illegal and you will be asked, perhaps not very politely, to stop and/or fined. Most places have an out-side area for smokers.

- Don't mess with the Queen's guard. Yeah the're used to it, but it still makes you look like an arse.

- Depending on how long you're here/what you're into here are [some cool places you can visit from London](http://www.buzzfeed.com/chelseypippin/25-wanderlust-worthy-day-trips-from-london#.jw1QBWnlz)

- If you're in a group of people don't block the entire pavement/road. One of the no. 1 thing that annoys the British about tourists is when they do this.

- The no. 2 thing is probably taking pictures across a reasonably busy road or pavement. We feel rubbish blocking your picture, but you're taking a picture in a stupid place. Please don't do it.

I think that's it. Enjoy your trip!

No, no no.  Strict liability isn't about apportioning blame, it's about assigning liability for insurance purposes.  There's a big difference.  It's basically saying that even though the accident may not have been your fault, because you chose to drive a huge vehicle through an area full of pedestrians, essentially a dangerous activity, that your insurance will pay for the damage.

Ings looked lively, he has a great touch and seems like he could be a good poacher too with that disallowed goal.

Gomez looked fantastic on that right hand side. I know he's a natural CB but afaik he spent a lot of the time on the right for Charlton. Going forward he looks like he could be a threat in the future.

Milner is as composed and unrelenting as I thought he'd be. I can see him becoming one of my favourite players we have.

Clyne I guess didn't have too much to do and I remember the least about him, but I'm positive he's going to be a massive upgrade on 2013-15 Johnson.

In the Police it's  arresting the low hanging fruit and trumping up charges to hit arrest targets.

For myself, I think some of the anti-development narrative has gone a bit too far, and is led in many parts by NIMBYs. We need to accept that London is global city with a growing population, and to be able to house people and provide world-class office space, we need lots of new buildings. In the economic era we are in, private development is realistically the only way we are going to achieve this, and for all its wrongs, without it we would not get anywhere near the amount of new builds required.

That said, there are issues around 'viability' assessments and the ways developers use s106 agreements and CIL payments to get around offering 'affordable' housing and yet still making massive profits. It seems that many local authorities are simply out of their depth when dealing with massive developments - how will you ensure that planning authorities have the power and ability to stand up for themselves in the face of big developers who use complicated financial processes to get around providing housing for normal Londoners?

An additional point - what do you think about 'affordable housing' as it is currently?

Anyway, jokes aside, I think we've done a good window. We might have bought too many players though and especially the fact that we now have Origi *and* Ings is worrying. They are now behind Sturridge and Benteke in the pecking order, probably for just one spot as forwards. 

If we play with two forwards on the other hand, we're probably looking at a diamond in which at least one spot is for a DM (Allen, Can or Lucas). That would mean Ibe, Marko, Lallana, Hendo, Cou, Firmino, Milner are competing for three spots in midfield. This isn't impossible of course and there's definitely a case for having basically two starting elevens. But it will make it harder for players like Ibe, Markovic, Rossiter to get time on the pitch.

As for the questions of another DM and/ or LB, I'd like to stress that the objective of each transfer window isn't to create a new perfect XI. Stability and continuity are also very important ingredients. And if we compare the starting XI from 13/14 with the coming season, there are only two players left - Henderson and Coutinho, maybe Sakho. That is a concern in itself. 

So right now, I'd rather have Allen, Can and Lucas competing for a DM spot than to get a new one. If Lucas isn't available, let Can/ Allen play with Henderson in a 4231. It's not ideal, but it would disrupt the team less than getting a new DM would. With the LB, I'd rather see Gomez, Wisdom, Flanagan as back-ups for both RB and LB than to get a new one. Again, not ideal, but good for them, and it probably won't hurt the team a lot either. The fullback positions are in all honesty the less ""dangerous"" positions on the pitch.

About having motorists train to deal with cyclists it only works if you train the cyclists to deal with motorists.  Far more motorists on the roads then there are cyclists.                 
While a lot of cyclists have a car license how many have driven a large van or truck? As any motorist the lack of visibility in them is shocking, but for a cyclist with arguably the small visual footprint of any road user is should change the way they cycle.             

Just seems every road user apart from cyclists and horse riders have test, training or restrictions. Out of the two cyclists are by far the most exposed and common on the roads.                       
                
I remember when I was a kid at primary school we had a few lessons on basic bike stuff like hand signals, road etiquette, shoulder checks etc.              
It seems to have either been a one off or vanished as my younger brother never did anything like it and I've not heard of it happening recently in schools.                 
    
Relevant example: About two weeks ago a lad about 10 years old, hopped off the curb from behind a parked van straight over two lanes of traffic at a junction, no stopping or slowing in anyway.         
Luckily I heard the suspension of the bike when he hopped the curb and could stop in time. My passenger at the time went white (she thought either I or the other drive would hit the lad as there was so little reaction time from seeing him) and a driver just about to turn at the junction looked stunned.               
If I hadn't had my window open or the other driver had been a second earlier to the junction there would have been no way that kid would have been riding home.",null,0,null,1437121942,null,0,false,0,ct6d4k2,null,t3_3dhhet,null,t1_ct6d4k2,null,t1_ct5qq2v,null,null,null,1437928772,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Assuming they spend the 6.3% difference in court costs and such, they're breaking even for the sake of the tiny minority. I have a feeling they spend more than that. Meanwhile, the 7% who don't claim are left without that which they are entitled to have. In short, the 7% of working age adults who could be claiming benefits are defrauded, not by the 0.7% who are committing fraud, but by the government.

I'm not saying benefit fraud is alright. I'm saying that it's a non-issue compared to the denial of rightful claimants of their money.

As you can see, the current one is a modern iteration of the 1953-1986.

* The lion comes from the [Arms of Earl Cadogan, which you can see in the centre.](https://i.imgur.com/VeVzXbz.jpg). At the time of 1953 badge's creation, he held the title Viscount Chelsea, and was the president of the club.

* The staff comes from the [Abbot of Westminster](http://i.imgur.com/P5ilprl.jpg), whose jurisdiction extended over Chelsea.

* The flowers are red roses, and represent England.

* The footballs are self-explanatory

null,false,skunkd,,Belfast,null,"&gt;The ideal is to gently convince people into the middle ground and provide space for the cultures to grow in a positive way, not attack or destroy them. Also: I'm not Alliance. I'm an (opinionated) individual and commentator who is a member and a supporter. Don't take anything I say as party policy or 'the party', unless I've taken it from the website, policy docs or news sites.

I find it instructive what opinions party members hold behind the scenes which they will obviously put forward when attending meetings, etc. Your post history is full of attacks on unionism. I asked what you were doing about SF in places like Newry where they name things after paramilitaries and your response was that's up to the unionists. I really do have a hard time looking past the current attack one side strategy of a self styled middle ground party.

&gt;there would be attempts to ban the orange order and bonfires entirely from alliances side ...An utter delusion of constantly being attacked.

You just posted a few days ago bonfires should be replaced with beacons citing jumped up fears for public safety! You literally asked for bonfires to be removed entirely...

&gt;Would I be accepted if I went to a bonfire and said I'd like to observe? Actually, I think 95% of the people there would be welcoming, however strongly loyalist they were. That 5% that would take a swing at me that unfortunately would stop me going (alone, at least). That other 95% I could have a perfectly good working relationship with.

I disagree with your finger in the air percentages but the crux is if you aren't able to talk to the organisers you have no say.

&gt;Luckily, in most areas the council funding and assistance seems to have closed the gap and lead to a decently run event.

So what is it to be ctni? Are things getting worse as you earlier claim or better as you appear to state above? And there's no 'luckily' about it, as if a large number of loyalist community workers, politicians, etc haven't been working to improve their areas.

&gt;But if the local leadership fails, then we can easily get another Chobham street. In fact, it's more likely now that someone's been allowed to get away with it once.

Hardly if as Jim Rodgers says it's the end of the Chobham St bonfire.

&gt;So at Chobham street there they are refusing to listen to anyone, because one person refusing to speak out until after the fact gave them cover. 

Really? Because *one* political leader talks after the current event (an event that is going to happen next year again...) Chobham St bonfire organisers were refusing to listen? If Gavin Robinson spoke out publicly prior to 11th night a big ray of light would shine down on the organisers and the thing would have been dismantled? You know you're making that up. Calling for stuff doesn't do shit.

&gt;I can criticise unionist politicians because they are the vacuum. They are preventing anyone else, in this case even the UUP, from stepping in and effecting change.

Comedy gold. Unionist politicians preventing unionist politicians from changing things, even when I've pointed out it was unionist politicians who were the ones stepping in. You are clearly just throwing muck and hoping some of it sticks.

&gt;See some of the outright sneering that occurred on TV during the election.

Is that like an alliance council member in Antrim going door to door in east Belfast handing out leaflets with the words 'Vote Alliance, keep the DUP out'?

&gt;Would there have been unrest regardless? Probably, it's NI. But EB would have been spared the brunt of it.

Wrong. EB got the brunt of it because of the UVF wanting to flex their muscles over the supergrass trials. They stirred all the violence in their main areas. But no, Alliance was more interested in electioneering, blaming a leaflet (!) from their local rivals for people taking to the streets. Went down well in the middle class streets, put the blame on someone they can do something against (vote against them) and not on the actual orchestrator who they can do nothing about (paramilitaries).

In fact you've been attempting to conflate the paramilitaries and unionist politicians in this very argument. Gavin's thug mates, sinister underbellies, etc, etc. You are blatantly stirring the pot instead of looking for consensus. Classic Alliance.

&gt;But don't confuse criticism of the badly managed ones for criticism of all bonfires. 

The problem is here that you are not just criticising bad bonfires. You are extrapolating to claim that it is a failure of unionist politicians. Despite the fact I pointed out local unionist politicians have been working to deal with the bad bonfires. And despite the fact your own party sits there issuing press statements from an office on bonfires in streets they know nothing about and without being able to do anything themselves about it. 

Oh yeah and naturally enough, if Long was MP she would have called for the bonfire to be taken down and everything would have just worked. That's how the change in flag policy went down after all.

null,false,hu6Bi5To,null,null,null,"Megacities are inevitable with modern industries focussed around needing people more than access to materials and resources (i.e. very much unlike the industrial revolution).

But yet we're still pretending as though everything can be managed with brown-field developments and the occasional ""garden city"".

We need to both: a) encourage the other cities to become centres of high-value industries (easier said than done); and b) allow London to continue to grow organically, and that means massive (i.e. many, many billions of pounds) spent on infrastructure and communications.

As things stand, how much longer can London's economy keep growing?  There doesn't seem to be any shortage of wide-eyed 22-year-olds turning up and occupying the bottom-rung of the employment ladder (both in well paid finance, and low-paid assistant-in-Starbucks, jobs).  But if you need an income in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, and/or savings of half-a-million or more to buy a family home, how are the middle-ranks of London industry going to survive?

Anecdotally it doesn't seem that they are.  A lot of businesses seem to be 95% populated by the wide-eyed 22-year-olds, with the occasional 26 year old who hasn't fled yet being middle-management.  Then there's a gap, and senior positions are occupied by those who bought in the 80's and think people are just grumbling.  (This doesn't really apply to the dominant industry, banking, but to everything else that's focussed there.)

Even people who used to happily commute are being put-off because of the rapidly growing numbers of commuters.

* Contract CAD technician.

Take a Solidworks / Inventor course and find a job as a cad technician in the mechanical engineering sector. After you have a bit of experience you can easily move to contract work which pays a minimum of £15/hour, sometimes 2-3 times that amount.

Im suggesting mechanical based engineering since its a broader field which requires less specialist knowledge and specific qualifications compared to Architectural, Structural, Civil (these disciplines use Microstation / Revit / AutoCAD instead).

* Scaffholders:

Of all the guys on site, these ones appear to have a good balance of high pay, low entry requirements, not the toughest jobs. Granted it is one of the most dangerous jobs on site &amp; you need to be ok with heights.

* Setting out engineer

Unlike site or consultant engineers, its not uncommon to find setting out engineers who dont hold a degree, they're often former groundworkers who took a short term surveying course. Minimum requirement would be a site surveying course where you will learn how to use a total station. Back in the day you could work as a chain man (assistant) to pick up the skills but developments in the technologies have largely negated this role. You will need to be reasonably good at maths (only basic trigonometry though). £35,000/year minimum. Some specialist jobs pay upto 3 times that amount.

* Oil Rigs / Mining / Pipeline

Any role in the fossil fuels industries pays VERY well. Granted you will be in the middle of nowhere &amp; to get into mining / pipeline you will need to move abroad (western australia or canada are the main ones).

Reading between the lines I think what's happened is that Martinez made the enquiry, saw the price and said ""nope"".  I suspect he wants to spend the the bulk of the cash he has left to bring in one more offensive midfield player (presumably a left sided one).  His statements about the strength of the current squad are hard to read (he's relentlessly, and annoyingly positive) but I do have that feeling he's got a lot of faith in the young boys coming through.

null,false,lepusfelix,null,null,null,"Exactly. The minimum wage in general tends to do more harm than good. Employers basically hunt around for what sort of wage is both low and acceptable, and the minimum is conveniently right there, enshrined in law. Instead of churning numbers and coming out with their preferred wage rate of like £9 or something like that, they don't have to. They have a number already, handed to them by the government.

On the other hand, it protects people from getting well and truly boned by big bosses with deep pockets and short arms, by dictating that nobody can legally pay less than X.

I think a better alternative to the minimum wage should be a target wage that is set by the government on a basis of what the work is and what industry it's in. That way, as soon as a vacancy comes up, the employer can consult a more tailored guideline wage for that job. They wouldn't be forced to pay the guideline amount, but since the guidelines would be published for all the world to see, they won't be filling those vacancies unless they're close to the guideline.

I earn a couple of quid an hour more than the NMW. I have no idea how the new NMW will affect me. Reasoning suggests I should get a payrise to keep me ahead of the NMW (i.e to keep my job sufficiently above the NMW, lest I be working for NMW in a couple of years), but expectation suggests otherwise.

We wouldn't normally bother with food recycling, but it seems like the decent thing to do, and with a small child throwing the equivalent of a man-sized portion of meal onto the floor three times a day, it's a necessity since the council have also slashed the size of our general waste bin in half, so that I'd be struggling to even e.g. hide a body in there, or similar large-bin-sized mass.

First of, you got all these investors, who have been investing due to the low low interest rates, in which buying property mans you can get a good saving, than just plopping it in a bank with a shitty rate of 1% compared to 5-8% that you could probably get on a property. 

Second, if interest rates go up, house prices will go down probably, but mortgages will go up, and if it moves to 2.5% imagine the amount of people with a 250K+ mortgage who now will probably have to pay £200+ or more a month on top of there already expensive mortgage... this is also after the fact that a lot of people in the UK are still living right up to the edge of affordability, so an increase could see what happened in America - Foreclosures. 

The government are changing things (slowly) such as removing the tax breaks, but they can't do it too fast.. if they do, they cause a shock and investors will flee, which might cause a spiral into recession in an already fragile economy. The BoE know this too, and I wouldn't be surprised if Mark Carney and is telling Osbourne that he is running out of time before they have to raise the base rate because the economy will suffer more. 


I feel property prices are purely a result of a low base rate, and when they do change I feel a correction will come, but at the moment they are easing the market slowly by applying the lube and gently probing before they give a big thrust into the ass that is the UK Property Market.",null,0,null,1437123846,null,0,false,0,ct6dlal,null,t3_3dj8xu,null,t1_ct6dlal,null,t1_ct6b7nl,null,null,null,1437929072,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I expected after the first few months to receive a gas / electricity bill. One never came. Four or five months following the purchase, I gave up on them chasing me, and instead tried chasing them. This proved fruitless. Without an MPAN number, nobody would take me.  I could not get an MPAN without asking my supplier. Despite many emails and phonecalls to the Grid as well as Scottish Power, nobody would tell me who my supplier actually was. I was stuck. 

Six weeks ago, a man came to the door to read my meter. He remarked that the account was in nobody's name, and he tapped some buttons on his computer that caused, some days later, a letter to arrive from Scottish Power, requesting that I visit their website to sign up.  This I do. I give them all my details, and brace myself for the bill to come.

A bill arrives.  It is addressed to the owner occupier. I assume this is in error, and wait a week for a corrected bill that correctly bares my name to be issued.  No such bill is forthcoming. I phone them up. They deny all knowledge of my account, and request that I register with them again, by phone. This I do.

So, another bill arrives a few days later.  Again, it is to Owner Occupier. I ignore it, and wait for one updated to show my name.  Skip forward to today. My newest bill arrives. It is still addressed Owner Occupier, but it lists all but £2 of charges as being cancelled. It doesn't explain why, it just asks me to send them addressed cheque for £2.18 to cover a year's worth of energy.

* If you grew up in London and its where your friends and family are that shouldn't be underestimated as a draw factor.

* There are a lot of jobs that don't really exist outside of London. Some careers are heavily represented in London. For example 75% of all UK architects work in London... and that means that the engineering, equipment, construction firms also have their offices in London. Other professions like law and IT also have a very strong showing in London. I mean that isn't to say you don't get lawyers and architects outside of London because obviously you do - but London tends to be where those professions have their main operations... and by extension the more prestigious and higher paying jobs.

If you look at places like Southampton it's actually an absolute mecca of construction at the moment, and one of the south easts few success stories that has weathered the crash. It probably started out because of the large student population in the city with a demand for BTL property - but that in itself has started to transform parts of the inner city which had been left dilapidated even as far back as the 2nd world war (during which the city took a horrendous pummeling on account of the docks and the supermarine factories there).

It's not the case that London is the only location that needs investment. But the issue is obvious: London prices are out of control, and that is bleeding into the surrounding area. The other week I was looking at rental prices for Guildford (a popular town on the London commuter route)... you're looking at about £1000 a month for a 1 bed flat of which there were very few. By contrast the same flat in Southampton (which is realistically just outside of daily commuting range to London) would go for about £650. In Plymouth that flat would go for about £500. 

The issue is London needs more property to lower prices by satiating demand. That in turn will relieve pressure on the broader southeast in places like Guildford which are seeing knock-on rises as Londoners look to move outside the city to lower rents - because whilst £1000 per month in Guildford might look bad, it looks a lot better than £1800 a month in London.",null,0,null,1437125303,null,0,false,0,ct6dy6r,null,t3_3dj8xu,null,t1_ct6dy6r,null,t1_ct6b1g5,null,null,null,1440476483,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,hu6Bi5To,null,null,null,"&gt; I've always said that all this obsession over house prices is hiding the true problem: rental prices.

I have a controversial and very depressing theory of the housing market.  It is my theory that rental prices are, almost by definition, an accurate reflection of the market value of housing.  A property becomes available, several people view it and show an interest; the price is set at a level that one of those people is prepared to pay; it's supply-and-demand in action.

Yes, rental prices are very high by most other criteria (rent to salary etc.), but this reflects two things: a) the complete lack of action surrounding sensible housing plans over the past 40 years; and b) the poor infrastructure in popular areas, e.g. people are willing to pay double to live in London because the commute to just so horrible from the much, much cheaper towns in surrounding areas.

&gt; My opinion is that it is housing developers that are to blame for the London house price, as new builds aren't priced for the average person anymore.

For-sale prices, on the other hand, are completely insane and bear no relation to reality whatsoever[0], especially the 1/2-bed flat sub-market, this is completely driven by speculation.  And, despite this are being dominated by buy-to-let landlords, the prices have become completely divorced from rental prices; especially in London.  In London sale-prices have been growing at least twice as fast (and often much more than that) than rental prices, so much so that the monthly cost of a mortgage greatly outstrips the equivalent rental price[1], unlike most of the rest of the country.

But, despite that, I don't blame developers for making as much money as they can.  If anything that should help encourage more development and increase supply.  The problem is the bubble in buy-to-let, and it has been a problem for twenty years, the only offical action so far has been to encourage growth of buy-to-let to displace problems elsewhere - e.g. the post-2008 nationalised banks turning a blind-eye to landlords with liar-loans on better terms than they would have got with buy-to-let mortgages.

If there was a subtle, and it would have to be subtle to avoid causing wider problems for everyone, way of deflating buy-to-let then some sort of balance would be achieved.  This wouldn't make things massively cheaper, as like I say, the current rental prices are probably fair (in a market-equilibrium kind of a way); but ought to get purchase prices in an equivalent price-bracket.  It seems so obvious that if you pay non-subsidised rent for exclusive use of a property, then you ought to be able to afford that property outright with appropriate financing, otherwise how is the landlord making money[2]?

&gt; increase the cost of keeping a property empty. This can be done via taxes, stopping the council tax reduction for unoccupied properties and/or introducing new taxes to disincentivise this behaviour.

This is why a land-value tax would be a good idea.  If there is a shortage of land, which is arguable for the UK as a whole, but definitely true in the towns and cities, then there needs to be a way to encourage efficient use of that land.  Yes, it means retired people living in Chelsea might need to sell up, but boo-hoo etc., they can only afford to move to *anywhere else*, this would also encourage a higher turnover rate of property sales, which will help the market be more efficient; at present the limited number of sales leads to the cash-rich ""investors"" effectively cornering the market.

&gt; It would be my hope that combined with our economy improving (making other investments an option again; the bond market is shit at the mo)

There are a few promising signs in that regard.  Better investment elsewhere, gradually rising interest rates, reduction in the tax benefits for landlords.  All of these should apply a gradual downward pressure.  But for genuinely ""affortable"" homes, only a massive building programme can achieve that.

[0] - The housing ""market"" is itself a bit of a myth, there's infinite sub-markets overlapping, it's not like a market at all where there's a well understood price for a known commodity.  Some of these sub-markets, I'd argue, are fairly valued; but others are massive bubbles.

[1] - Obviously this depends on how big a mortgage compared to earnings, LTV, etc.; and I am comparing a repayment mortgage vs rent.  Interest-only would be closer, but still more expensive than rent.

[2] - The answer is, they're not, on a month-by-month basis; but they are long-term because of the next generation of speculators willing to dump billions in the market for some reason.",null,0,null,1437125398,null,0,false,0,ct6dz0a,null,t3_3dj8xu,null,t1_ct6dz0a,null,t1_ct6b7nl,null,null,null,1437929300,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

Euro games tend to be much less luck driven, the theme tends to be a bit bland (farming, trading in the Mediterranean etc) and conflict tends to be indirect e.g. taking the resource your opponent needed before they could, rather than attacking them straight out.

These kind of games (and the community) developed mostly in Germany which is why they get called German style or Euro games. It's sort of losing it's meaning now as in modern gaming  both styles are blending together and most games exist somewhere on a spectrum.

2020 arrives, and you're standing in the polling booth. Before you are various candidates - you're telling me how much of their salary they've given away won't affect your decision?

So far so good, right? Wrong. By starting this race to the bottom, only the wealthy can afford to stand as MPs, further exacerbating 
the flaws in our very own parliamentary democracy.

To conclude, whilst seeming admirable on the surface, MPs donating their salaries to charity is actually quite a dangerous gambit.

-Your location (town/city) matters more than anything else, fi you are not happy then try moving, you may need to take a leap of faith and you may find you need to move a few times to find the right place for you.

-In 2015 the UK is a really tough place to live, in 2010 it was not and in 2005 it was not so be careful searching for advice online and check that the advice/articles were written on or after 2014!

-People don't care, there are no or very little mental health services and these are reserved for people with major problems or people who are a risk to the public

-Council may or may not help you, try it but they may tell you that you aren't in priority need! If they offer you a shitty hostel take it and deal with it for however long as it leads to permanent accommodation which is most of the way to having your life fixed.

-DO NOT base your life or decisions on your credit file and don't let it get you down, unlike the US or some EU countries your credit file is NOT protected in this country, meaning if you haven't already you will get a rubbish score due to mistakes. To get a good credit file in this country you either need an accountant, or to spend a huge amount of time (pretty much all your free time) on the phone to various companies and credit reference agencies.

-You may find it easier to relocate to one of the more stable European countries until the situation in this country improves, I would personally recommend Germany or Poland but your mileage may vary, remember that the value of any money will increase in most EU countries.

-When you do get your own place and stable, you will be forced into debt as is the agenda in this country. This will most likely be through council tax but can come as a surprise unexpected bill or worse! Expect it and you will be ok, don't let it get you down!

-""If you are unhappy and want change, but don't do anything to change it the you'll remain unhappy"", ie. if you aren't happy then change stuff until you are happy.

Worst case scenario is you'll be made homeless with no money or possessions. What I'm about to say is a LAST resort only!!!!


**THE FOLLOWING ADVICE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND I'M NOT LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY REPERCUSSIONS!!!**

First step, choose a country (nowhere in the UK!) you want to call home and research it, learn the language of possible, use a cybercafe or library do not do this on your own computer/phone/tablet, this will be your future home! Select a date you will leave!

Between now and then take EVERYTHING you own (smartphones, computers, laptops, TV's, jewellery, vintage collectables etc.) and sell it for as much as you can You are looking to amass as much money as possible. Now you want to try to get as large as an overdraft as possible from your bank and/or try a loan, do the same with payday lenders and get as much money as you can from every source possible, borrowed and made, Keep this in cash on your person. Lastly get as money phone contracts as possible with the highest end phones, now immediately sell these phones!

Now change your name by deedpole but don't tell ANYONE your new name, once this is done get a passport under your new name and leave the country. DO NOT tell anyone where you are going and to help things change your look, hair style and clothes. 

Just get on the plane and leave! You will probably not have found anywhere to live so when you get to where you are going you will want to find the cheapest possible hostel (backpackers hostels are usually cheap). Now from here your new life begins, you will want to find a job, THEN a home/room in a shared house and you will build up from here.

IF you make it big and have lots of money then be sure to pay off your UK debts so you have a 100% clear name, you may get 1 or 2 debt letters a few years after, just pay these off if they are local to your country debt collectors.

It sounds a bit ridiculous but it beats spending your life alone, homeless, cold and ragged and is definitely the better of the 2 evils.",null,0,null,1437125787,null,0,1437126003,0,ct6e2br,null,t3_3dgcmy,null,t1_ct6e2br,null,t3_3dgcmy,null,null,null,1437929374,null,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0,null

As I said elsewhere in this thread, if being ""not built mentally to survive life"" is an a-okay reason to let someone die, then being ""not built physically to survive life"" should be too.

null,false,mushroomgodmat,null,null,null,"&gt; About having motorists train to deal with cyclists it only works if you train the cyclists to deal with motorists

But thing is most cyclists are motorists. Train motorists and you in turn train cyclists. And you also train every non cyclist to look at things from a cycling perspective. Which cycle training for cyclists would never do. 

I dare say this approach would change attitudes in a positive way within a number of years.  

Also, there are many stats on who is to blame in most collisions, and its usually the motorist. Thats not to say cyclists are always blameless of course.

&gt; Far more motorists on the roads then there are cyclists.

Thats a tricky one ill admit.

There are a bunch of slightly dull replies  I could give you for that (most of which to do with the fact that's irrelevant, and the bigger picture of too many cars needs to be considered), but what I would say is training has been shown to be problematic, and does add a barrier to cycling. And believe it or not, less cyclists would result in more dangerous roads for cyclists (see the ""safety in numbers"" effect.)

Ultimately I'm not really in disagreement with you. I have no problem with training in principle, but it needs to be done correctly - just training one group (often to protect them from another group) is very problematic. But looking past that I think we both agree (in some part) that that training at school (which Ill get to in a mo) is a good thing...Though I obviously see more benefit of adding it into a driving test, or at the very least be more focused in a driving test. 

&gt;Just seems every road user apart from cyclists and horse riders have test, training or restrictions

Due totally to the danger. 

&gt;I remember when I was a kid at primary school we had a few lessons on basic bike stuff like hand signals, road etiquette, shoulder checks etc.
It seems to have either been a one off or vanished as my younger brother never did anything like it and I've not heard of it happening recently in schools.

Yep, all gone now. There are quite a few cycling advocates who are campaigning to bring it back. But even then its very very very problematic. 

Most of bikeability training now is to do with defensive cycling (in part due to the overall attitude on the road). It teaches you the basics, it also teaches you do ""take the lane""....Something I personally advocate (in the right situations), but can you imagine teaching 10-15 year olds to claim their space on a road?...especially when many motorists assume they should cycle by the curb/drains etc...

But also, its something of a dead end at the moment. Parents drive their kids to school, making it dangerous for everyone else. Im sure if you said to most parents we will teach your kids to cycle and use the public road they would be petrified at the dangers...Which in part they are responsible for. 

&gt;Relevant example: About two weeks ago a lad about 10 years old,

I can't defend that obviously, I would say though that even with training (I assume his mum had taught him how to cross a road) he still acted recklessly. And that's the thing, we shouldn't confuse common sense and training.

First you want to check the address you will be moving too to see what services are available. Make sure you do a postcode and address check not just an area check.

You might see one or all of the following...
Cable - this is Virgin Media in the UK, Virgin Media offer great speeds however not unlike Comcast in the states their customer service can be terrible and their service often goes down without warning, these outages can last hours! Many areas are over-subscribed so you may find your speeds suffer at peak times.

**Speeds Available**
1: 50Mbit down, 3Mbit up
2: 100Mbit down, 6Mbit up
3: 152Mbit down, 12Mbit up

Virgin are also trialing 300Mbit down and 15Mbit up and will most likely be upgrading their speeds which they do semi-regularly. Again their service and customer services can suffer from problems. You will always get the advertised speeds from Virgin if the service is working as expected.

FTTC/B/H - This is the best and what you should hope to get, Always choose this option if available!! Who the best ISP are is open to heated debate but the primary ones are BT (the package you want is called BT Infinity). I personally use TalkTalk Business, Andrew &amp; Arnold are pretty awesome but it can cost quite a lot and is really meant for tech heads. Openreach (part of BT) run the entire network, TalkTalk have their own equipment at the exchange so the 2 main FTTC ISP's are TalkTalk and BT. Other ISP's except Virgin will be using the infrastructure.

**Speeds Available**
1: 40Mbit down, 20Mbit up (often advertised as a bit less, usually 36Mbit down)
2:80Mbit down, 20Mbit up (often advertised as 76Mbit)

You will get what your line can support, depending on distance from the street cabinet usually ranges from 55Mbit to the full 80Mbit. This is a physical limitation and not bad business practice!

ADSL - If you only see ""upto 16Mbit"" offered as the best option available to you then I have some bad news for you, you can only get ADSL and will most likely get quite poor speeds. ADSL technology in this country is very behind the rest of the world and rather than connecting to the street cabinets, your line connects all the way to the nearest exchange (most large cities have 2 or 3, in London most but not all boroughs have an exchange). This means that ADSL speeds range from around .5Mbit down and .1Mbit up to 15Mbit down and 1.2Mbit up. DO NOT expect anything better than that. you do not want to select this option unless you have no other option.

**Speeds Available**
16Mbit down, 1.2Mbit up (or 2.2Mbit up if you find an ISP that supports ANNEX M), you will probably not get the advertised speeds)",null,0,null,1437126913,null,0,false,0,ct6ebzs,null,t3_3ddaim,null,t1_ct6ebzs,null,t3_3ddaim,null,null,null,1437929589,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Edit : Here is an example.

[Tesco Peanut Butter.](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=264769626)

[Tesco Reduced Fat Peanut Butter.](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=251624367)

On the face of it using the traffic lights they've got **8.8g of fat and 0.3g of sugar** into **5.7g of fat and 1.3g of sugar**.

So they've done ok? Actually no they have not. Let's look at the ingredients.

The normal stuff - 

&gt;Ingredients:
Roasted Peanuts (90%), Peanut Oil, Palm Oil, Sugar, Salt

&gt;Ingredients:
Roasted Peanuts (67%), Dried Glucose Syrup, Maltodextrin, Palm Oil, Salt

The difference as you can see is that they've greatly reduced the amount of peanuts in there and added dried glucose syrup and maltodextrin in there to bulk it up.

And if you look at the real nutritional information, not the misleading traffic lights..

They've turned **4.0 g protein | 1.1 g carbs | 8.8g** fat into **2.8g protein | 5.6g carbs | 5.7g fat**.

Why are they saying only a small increase in sugar? Because they're using things that they don't have to declare as sugar. 

**Edit : TL;DR - They need to change the traffic lights to list carbs and not sugar because companies are already hiding vast amounts of not-quite-sugar that way.**",null,0,null,1437126957,null,0,1437132003,0,ct6ecd1,null,t3_3dlrl1,null,t1_ct6ecd1,null,t3_3dlrl1,null,null,null,1437929594,null,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19,null

Partly old sectarianism that won't go away as it's passed down the generations and all the signs and symbols of a divided community are still in places, flegs, murals, painted kerbstones, bonfires etc.   I've lived in England and i'd see more union jacks in one street of belfast than I would have in my whole time living in newcastle.


Partly it's a bored youth population turning to violence. There's no real logic to the violence. A vid was released saying a new paramilitary group is taking up arms to defend the community and the next night these lil shits go an thrash an old peoples home in their own street, so it's not anything to do with the community/local people.   It's louts being louts.  I would imagine the British folk aren't exactly keen to be associated with this other batch of british folk rioting in NI? 


Religion was the original divide that split the country but it's gotten more complicated than that. Religion isn't really a part of peoples lives in the sense that they are practising christians but when it comes to 'us and them' both side turn in staunch Catholic/Protestants.


To be a bit more specific, what you see in the video is the reaction of the local louts when the Orange Order could not march down a street because the parades commission voted in favour of only allowing them to walk down it once but not the return journey. So when they are blocked, they riot.  If they weren't blocked there is a good chance the nationalist louts would be out to protest/riot over this happening in their streets.

Ultimately boils down to 1 group wanting to celebrate their history of defeating the catholic king and to reinforce their position each year. They claim it's their culture, tradition and right to celebrate that victory.  The nationalists on the other side are unhappy with this tradition as it isn't one of unity, it's celebrates their defeat so you can hardly expect them to be happy.  This gets compounded with issues such as rising unemployment.


I guess one poor analogy would be the living descendants of vikings in parts of england and parading through the streets of London etc in memory of the times when they would sack and pillage english villages and celebrate the defeat of the english king. Yes, it's a legitimate victory but it's a bit insensitive to rub it in the noses of the people that still live there on such a massive scale.

null,false,TranshumansFTW,eng-dorset,Dorset Expat in Aus,null,"The problem with this is figuring out accountability, responsibility and who holds each respective bag (or if there even is one).

Accountability means ""who is *accountable* for this action"" - it's asking the question of who is the one who can be held up and declared, ""this is the person who we can punish"". 

Responsibility means ""who is *responsible* for this action"" - it's asking the question of who is the person who actually performed it, or in some cases ordered it done. 

You can be responsible without being accountable, and rather twistedly you can also be accountable without being responsible. Additionally, sometimes both accountability and responsibility are ""split up"", so that no one person is solely accountable or responsible, making recriminations very difficult. 

For example, if a company engages in extremely anticompetitive behaviour, such as forming a collusive oligopoly to artificially inflate prices, this is a financial and business crime. It can result in prison sentences for those who are found to be solely accountable.

But, what if hundreds of people are found to be *accountable* (such as if they were the ones who were actually engaged in performing the collusion), but only two people were found to be *responsible* (perhaps because only one person in each company actually coordinated the collusion)?

Well, in this scenario, hundreds of lackeys would get fines, or sent to prison, whilst those two high-ups who weren't technically *accountable* for the wrongdoing would get off Scott free. This is because accountability and responsibility are neither the same, nor are they interchangeable. 

On the other hand, what about a situation that happens a lot - a board of directors who want to engage in severely unethical business practices. Let's use the example of toxic chemicals used in consumable products.

---

A company (let's call the company Cakes International, selling cake batter) wants to find a way of reducing their overheads, and they do this by outsourcing manufacture to a factory in Bangladesh. Now, like many companies that do this, they need to audit the factory before hand to make sure that it's safe for use in the production of goods. However, during the audit the investigator discovers that not only is child labour being used in the factory, but the factory is also producing toxic chemicals that are contaminating the batter they're making for their clients.

This is terrible, of course, but the board of directors of Cakes International really doesn't want to find another factory. That would involve a LOT of expenses, not least a new audit. So, they decide to illegally disregard the audit findings, and press ahead with the factory. 

In order to do this, they need to silence their auditor who is now legally obligated to report them for breaking the law. They contact him, and tell him that if he were to go to the police, he would never work in audit again. They offer him a $100,000 bribe to shut his mouth, and penury if he doesn't. 

In this case, who is accountable for the cases of arsenic poisoning that will occur from those who buy Cakes International batter? That's a complicated question, but most likely it is our friend the auditor. He's accountable for the reporting of Cakes International, and the fact that he's not doing that is a criminal offence. 

Meanwhile, whilst the Board of Directors member who approached him might well be guilty of blackmail (another crime), the other directors are merely *responsible* for illegal action, without being accountable. 

Where do we put the blame? Do we blame the guy who was accountable, even though he was blackmailed into it? Do we blame the brains of the outfit, even though they weren't accountable, only responsible?

The answer is the former, and under your law he'd be obligated to go to prison, whilst the BoD members got another pension.",null,0,null,1437127808,null,0,false,0,ct6ejol,null,t3_3dlsmo,null,t1_ct6ejol,null,t1_ct6dnuh,null,null,null,1437929780,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

For me, it's telling that Lennon has played under many managers for us (5? I can't remember) and none of then (until now) have seemed to want him gone. He gets a lot of stick from us, but I will be sad when he's gone and he should be remembered as a good servant to the club. He's often been sidelined even when he's playing well. He never seems to moan about this, and always runs his socks off and is actually pretty good defensively. That's rare for a winger.  He'll never ever be a top player - but I still feel he can do a job and when he's on his game he is still very hard to deal with (and it's also interesting to note that he has always played very well with Walker). He hasn't looked great for us recently, but he was quite good for Everton. Mainly, I just don't like Moses much.

Edit - I have to disagree with your last point. Even before Poch came, Lennon was always an incredibly hard working player. I can't count the times he's closed down the keeper, then when they cleared it got back to cover behind Walker/Corluka etc. No reason why he couldn't implement a high press.",null,0,null,1437127841,null,0,false,0,ct6ejze,null,t3_3djyf6,null,t1_ct6ejze,null,t1_ct6dkbd,null,null,null,1437929795,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

Eventually through a friend at an agency I got a job at a call centre.

I worked hard and was an example employee. The kind of employee they use to demo staff to clients.

I think there is an over supply of labour and an under supply of skills. The under supply of skills is due to technological acceleration.

It's complicated.

Unfortunately companies are putting up ridiculous adverts (Think 20-30 years in the business type stuff, numerous certifications required and all for shit pay) that nobody would ever take as a job, then when that doesn't work they get a foreign person under the scheme by listing a totally different and more fair (but still underpaid) job offer for what they originally had in mind, not the ludicrous offer nobody would take.

Where is this money coming from then? It needs to come from somewhere and usually that is at the detriment of other areas.

Of course money matters. It's money for the entire country's healthcare. 

As to why just giving transgenders surgery instead of it beinging a careful considered option it may be worth reading this paper.

Some of us actually hit the street (not literally punching the pavement) and report when people are protesting. 

The issue though for many journalists is that the British public have become so apathetic towards the action of protest because of the demonisation of anyone who goes against the ""status quo"" that there never seems to be enough people actually protesting to go out and cover.

Take the protest outside Parliament straight after the Tory election victory. They were claiming to have 200,000 people or so, but it was very evident to most journalists that the number had been exaggerated ten fold by the organisers. Obviously however, some naive younger journos were sent out by older, jaded senior reporters and ended up buying into the whole 200,000 strong line.  

That, on top of the ironic fact they were protesting against a government that was democratically elected the previous night (FPTP system is a whole other argument in itself), led to the whole movement getting an even bigger arse-fucking by the right-wing press and made out to be muppets.

Let's say I target known individuals of interest for clandestine data surveillance. I gather data on them, stop their evil plans, and send them to Belmarsh once I've got enough evidence that they're a baddie. Woo.

However, what if I discover a person of interest once they've *already* talked to their mates about being baddies? Because they weren't on my radar back then, I don't know what they were saying or who they were talking to, so I don't know if they were planning anything that I need to prevent, nor can I charge them with anything. This is a RiskToDemocracy^(TM).

The obvious solution, therefore, is to gather data on *everyone*, so that if anyone turns out to be a baddie, I can retrospectively harvest their communications data.

* Will it be the entire length of the street from Tottenham Court Road to Marble Arch?  

* Will it be semi-pedestrianisation, allowing buses and taxis, or a total prohibition of vehicles?

*  Does the Mayor of London have the jurisdiction to pedestrianise Oxford Street (via TfL) or will it have to be done with the permission of Westminster Council?

I get that in country with a formal constitution (the obvious example being the US) a law can be said to conflict with the constitution, and the constitution has the higher authority.

But here we have parliamentary sovereignty, right? That means the legislative branch cannot be overruled by the judicial. According to the government's own website, there are some situiations where soverignty has de facto been reduced (e.g. the Human Rights act) - but even in these cases a government can just say 'nope, not following that anymore.'

Not only does this budget contradict a lot of manifesto pledges, the Tory manifesto never really said anything about welfare other than £12bn of cuts. Whether the public would have still agreed with the Tories if their manifesto had been a 100% accurate proposal of what they were going to do is unclear. I mean its kinda hard to ignore that at least two of the points in Labour's manifesto that the Tories claimed were ""absolutely going to destroy the economy"", ended up in their own fucking budget...

The Tories said not solving the deficit at the pace they were before the election was going to wreck the economy, and yet the budget now puts targets that are at the same speed as what Miliband was proposing. It's so fucking moronic.

This is kinda why I've always been in favour of some kind of regulation and independent regulatory body to prevent this kind of ""bait-and-switch"" style politics....

Gomez is turning out to be a massive talent; may just make a place for himself as LB. Great performance today.

Nobody is doing that here. You are arguing against phantoms.

I am with you that it's a real problem there are not more women with children in politics - obviously having more people who understand the particular stresses of motherhood would be a good thing.

yes we are.

As an employer, again... bullshit. 

&gt;Getting a degree is rational.

If its a requirement for the role yes as long as there are enough jobs of that role available... take forensic science degrees compared to forensic science positions as an example.

&gt;Trying to raise the educational level of the population is rational.

not only rational its a fucking nececcity... education levels have slipped massively over the last 20 years.

Searching for ""bomb"" is more likely to get you discussions like this, or bad jokes, or slang, this than it is to get you a terrorist, by orders of magnitude, for example.

And the trope of ""we can't talk about this on the phone - someone may be listening"" is about as old as the phone, and transfers to the net as well. 

Sure, mass surveillance will get the odd idiot. But the level of operational security needed before trivial queries stop working is just as trivial. Put in place even a basic code book, and keyword searches stop working (though you're then still vulnerable if they realise you're of interest). Heck a Caesar cipher - a simple character shift code, of the kind you can use cardboard toy code-wheels for, - is sufficient to stop plain keyword searches. Do proper encryption and their more advanced content analysis falls apart too. Do steganography and post the pictures to imgur and submit them to some sub-reddit, and you'll just seem like a prolific lover of cat-pictures.

Throwaway e-mail addresses, some pay-as-you go sims and a mifi device dropped by someone not directly connected to you, and searching for communication between known subjects of interest suddenly becomes a problem even if you have all the data. 

This to me is the almost as big a problem with mass surveillance as the privacy angle and the threat to democracy it creates: It will only stop the incompetents and the innocent. 

Anyone who bothers spending half a day reading up on technology and talking to someone halfway technically competent can come up with operational security guidelines that requires them to specifically be after *you* before your communication is even at risk.

Heck, the ANC put in place electronic message exchanges that provided basic protection against most of these types of surveillance methods way back in the 80's ( [Talking to Vula](http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4693) is a must read account the evolution of their methods), and they largely figured it out on their own. I'm sure other groups had similar setups. Today it's trivial to do far better at far less cost.

Because it will only stop the incompetents, there's a real danger it creates a false sense of security.

It is perfectly rational for people to try to hoover up low price tickets for shows which are going to be over-subscribed, safe in the knowledge that people will be happy to pay well over face value, because the promoter is attempting to artificially lower the price without increasing the supply.  This is very obviously going to create an arbitrage opportunity which people will take advantage of.

There are two ways to avoid this.  Either price the tickets at market rates, or put on a large enough number of shows that the price of the tickets would drop in value to what you deem acceptable for fans to pay.  Or I guess just implement loads of needless laws and security protcols which punish people for acting rationally.  And anyway, say I buy my ticket for £20, but someone offers me £50 for it.  If I value my ticket at £25, why shouldn't I be allowed to sell it if I want to?

And here are some other shops that will have them:

* [Real Foods](http://www.realfoods.co.uk/) (there are two of them in Edinburgh) is great for vegetarian/vegan stuff.
* [Jordan Valley](http://jordan-valley.co.uk/) on South Bridge is amazing - the only place I know which has prepackaged tofu sandwiches!

Anywhere west or south-west of the city centre is usually a good bet: Walkley, Crookes, Broomhill, Ecclesall Road, Hunter's Bar, Greystones, Sharrow, Nether Edge, Heeley, and Meersbrook are all pretty great. I've lived in (or very close to) all of these areas, and I've loved all of them. Lots of affordable houses, lots of lovely small shops and nice pubs, nearly all walkable to the centre or on major bus routes, all very safe.

Kelham Island just north of the centre is becoming quite nice too. It was a mostly derelict industrial area only 10 years ago that's seeing a lot of development activity recently, with many of the old industrial buildings being preserved. It also has some of the best pubs in the country (Fat Cat, Kelham Island Tavern, Milestone).

Here's a map of the above areas to give you an idea of where I'm talking about: https://goo.gl/maps/GxwQU

The only bits within that area that I'd suggest you avoid are Broomhall (the area just either side of Hanover Way, part of the ring road to the west of the centre), and some of the roads off Abbeydale Road and London Road. Even then, most of these areas are lovely, safe, and *very* cheap. The Abbeydale Road area (especially at the bottom of Sheldon Road around the Picture House and the Broadfield pub) has become insanely cool of late, with loads of antiques/vintage shops and interesting venues... if that's what you find interesting.

I like neither the SNP nor left wing politics, but I can see the gap labour have left.

When Tim Farron gave his acceptance speech yesterday there was something he said which really struck home about labour when he was talking about the libdems being a vocation and not a career.

If you wanted to be in politics and you are from the left you joined labour. But you also joined labour if you were centre right, or centre if you are from a labour area. That's why labour have gone wrong, they've become a party of career politicians obsessed with being elected without any core principles and across the UK people know it.

I mean that perhaps they might normally be sacked until they learn the right work ethic.

Have poorly motivated unskilled youth not always been with us?

The job market was never perfect. I think most this kind of person eventually found themselves. If we play them off skilled foriegn workers that isn't going to happen.

&gt;&gt; Comparing them to educated adults who are leaving poorer economies and of course the foreign workers will appear better.
&gt; indeed they would, i actively try to employ from locally and from schools and collages to give these younger people a start in the industry. local unemployment is high and my area is traditionally strong in the skills we need. Im trying in our own little way to 
support growth an regeneration in my area.

That's great. Completely laudable. But you are in danger of suffering funding or at least offering them that second schooling. That second puberty.

You have to think of that as partly charity work if you are to continue. For the sake of your own business though you have to judge the cost. Foreign workers are likely to always be a safer bet over all. You can get good workers out of the locals but at higher cost in time and money.

The bottom line will force you to employ foreign workers.

&gt;&gt; The education system is never going to be good enough to supply with more motivated and educated workers than a vast supply of poorer countries supply labour.
&gt;teaching relevant skills and stopping the issue of exams results as little more that a participation medal would help a great deal.

I'm just not sure if the education system has gotten worse. I can't really comment.

I expect you are not picking up the pupils who got the most out of the system. For whom it worked.

&gt;Also a thing to remember that a worker from a poorer country who has 'got the skills' you require, once they are position you usually find out they don't know anything near the level that that level of skill. my source for this assertion is skilled turners and millers from poland who couldnt run a bath let alone a machine.

Most things will be on show, generally you won't need to ask what whiskeys they got as you can see them.

Everything is measured. When they get the jigger out to measure shots you're not getting stiffed, you're getting what you paid for, no more no less. Having said that some places will use speed pours but they're still giving you a measured amount, there's none of this tip for a stronger drink business.

British shots are smaller than you'll be used to, 25ml or 35ml. Maybe go for a double.

The pints will probably be bigger than you're used to. I'm not sure of the exact figure but I think it's something like 20 oz instead of 18 or 16.

Tabs are possible but not common. Generally you pay as they serve you and then take it away to where you're drinking.

Beer is much more commonly drunk here than spirits. Try ale.

Most people drink in rounds. [This is exactly how it works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYb55tx-WK0) Judging from /r/askuk this seems trip up to Americans. Join in if you want, it's okay to skip a round if you're still drinking, generally it's assumed that if someone buys you a drink you'll buy them one later - don't worry about it not being completely even by the end of the so long as you have actually bought some drinks and not just completely sponged off other people.

It's not related but I've not seen anyone mention it yet. This is very important. **DO NOT CARRY A KNIFE.** I don't care how useful it is and how it's definitely not a weapon. The plod do not agree. Leave it at home.

The judiciary can not make or change or repeal law (EDIT: *where doing so would overrule parliament*- as pointed out by stronimo they can in some circumstances make law; it just can't overrule parliament while doing so)), but the judiciary is the authority on how to interpret laws when two valid laws are inconsistent with each other.

In this case the High Court has effectively said ""you've passed laws in the past that establish these principles, and we can't reconcile this new law with those, so after March 2016 we'll ignore this stuff if you haven't fixed it"". Parliament is free to resolve this either by fixing DRIPA, or by going back and repealing the legislation that provides those protections. But doing the latter would involve breaking EU treaties, which would open a whole other can of worms both politically and in terms of doing it in way that would hold up in court.

Note that even though parliamentary sovereignty in principle prevents one parliament from binding another, the courts expects parliament to be *explicit* about it by specifically repealing provisions that should no longer be in force.

This is the reason why merely passing DRIPA did not make what was in it legal. DRIPA did not include explicit language to state that it repeals so-and-so other protections, and so the courts take the view that it did not, and that parliament opted to keep both in force, creating the conflict that the courts had to resolve.

To the pro-Corbyn side: no Corbyn isn't the saviour of the party, he is no Clement Attlee. Whilst he has genuine and passionate socialist views which represent the roots of the party, his inability to compromise will ultimately be his downfall. 

As we saw with Syriza, being able to compromise and know when to fold is an important quality if you want to be able to get even half of what you want. Syriza refused to compromise at every turn, and this ultimately meant that instead of getting a reasonable deal that would supported their goals whilst also giving something to their creditors, they are stuck with a deal that is even worse than what the creditors were originally proposing. Early on their creditors were willing to meet them half-way, but Syriza's refuse to meet them half-way in return cost them everything.

To the anti-Corbyn side: no Corbyn being elected as Labour leader will not mean fire and brimstone will rain down from the sky and burn all roses to extinction, with Cameron's face looming in the blue sky afterwards. No, he is not Michael Foot - as Corbyn actually isn't a frail man with no charisma, and even if he was, Foot's selection wasn't what broke the 1983 election. [Polls at the time](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/voting-intention-1979-1983) actually had Labour polling highly even after the SDP split. In fact, Labour's support briefly surged after his selection, only dropping after the SDP split (with the drop consistent with the rise of support for the Liberal-SDP alliance)

In fact, for several months the Liberal-SDP alliance and Labour were the two most popular parties, with the Tories only having the third highest support. Had the Falklands War never happened, we would have been living in a bizarro world where the Tories and Lib Dems swapped places.

tl;dr If the party self-destructs as a result of Corbyn's election, it will only be because we got so caught up in hysteria that we all descended in petty infighting that splits the party in two.

We have to start giving players a chance at some point, we dont and people with potential rot away.

The two choices (in my country) were Man U. or Liverpool. Since my friends were split into two groups on the subject and I wanted to take the diplomatic route I chose the one team that had players that I remembered from my old sticker book.

Asus RoG Crosshair III Formula

Both are in good condition and full working, I have boxes for both and the original cooler/backplate/sound card/etc. CPU has been overclocked @ 4.2GHz for the last 2-3 years on a H80 and has run perfectly.

Have poorly motivated unskilled youth not always been with us?
The job market was never perfect. I think most this kind of person eventually found themselves. If we play them off skilled foriegn workers that isn't going to happen.

lol yes i was a poorly skilled unmotivated youth...while the minimum wage is a solid concept sadly (in my field) its not really helping people as before we could tolerate lower performance, output and motivation now we cant we can only afford to employ people who will give us a solid return on our investment.

&gt;That's great. Completely laudable. But you are in danger of suffering funding or at least offering them that second schooling. That second puberty.

Thank you, we're committed to get engineering back in the classroom i also attend schools to give talks to the kids and help my local schools with a scheme called 'primary engineer'

&gt;You have to think of that as partly charity work if you are to continue. For the sake of your own business though you have to judge the cost. 

for us the cost will be 10 years down the road when there are no skills left in the uk workforce and we will be royally fucked. we do treat the apprentices as 'charity work' this is offset by the government grants we get for employing them.

&gt;Foreign workers are likely to always be a safer bet over all. 

Yeah... not so much, language barriers are one problem and they are flighty buggers too, flit form one job to another very quickly... they're worse that welders ffs !

&gt;You can get good workers out of the locals but at higher cost in time and money.

good god we try to.

&gt;The bottom line will force you to employ foreign workers.

were fighting to make sure we dont 'have' to do that

&gt;I'm just not sure if the education system has gotten worse. I can't really comment.

worse is a loose term, not in touch with its customer (companies) would be better.

&gt;I expect you are not picking up the pupils who got the most out of the system. For whom it worked.

not true, we told our local training provider (sort of a sixth form collage for engineering) to send us their best 3 as we have a vacancy but experience tells us one out of three will stay the course.

test was, to use std measuring equipment to measure a component (verniers and micrometers) and write those measurements on the drawing and say if the job was right or not... They all failed, one couldn't even use a micrometer !

Basic trig test required for working out toolpaths on the fly... all failed even with provided calculators.

wire up a plug with instructions provided, one did this reall well and passed (ive still got him, cracking lad he is) one couldnt work out the instructions and one just sat there and decided he wouldnt even try.

this in my opinion is disgusting ! these were their BEST having been taught and passed out as thier best these lads thought they had recieved a good grounding.. they had not its not thier fault its the education thats at fault. i honestly felt sorry for them.


&gt;That's confusing now. How would you describe them then? Enthusiastic but narrowly skilled?

yes very strong work ethic... however what passes for fully skilled in another country does not here...example would be that issue about foreign nurses not being up to the level of what we would call a nurse ?

On the contrary, I find it nice and refreshing to hear all these accents. Early Australian television had a lot of BBC programming, so hearing these accents is like seeing/hearing the ""original"" thing. e.g. we all listened to the Monty Python ""Four Yorkshiremen"" sketch but you'd never hear a real Yorkshire accent in Australia.

Similar for ""that"" accent that Brad Pitt did in the movie Snatch, or hearing someone speak like Liam Neeson, or Sean Connery.   

While I might not be able to understand a Brummie accent at all times, I don't think that they are ""bad"" or ""worse"" than anything, and I think that's a class issue

I can understand that when someone doesn't speak clearly, from the point of view of the listener, then the listener may perceive it as an education issue.

Responding to Jeremy Hunt’s ""wholesale attack"" on doctors and his comments on seven-day services, Dr Mark Porter, BMA council chair, said:

“Doctors support more seven-day hospital services and have repeatedly called on the government to outline how they will fund and staff them. Despite whatever the health secretary may claim, his simplistic approach ignores the fact that this is a much broader issue than just doctors’ contracts.

“Today’s announcement is nothing more than a wholesale attack on doctors to mask the fact that for two years the government has failed to outline any concrete proposals for introducing more seven-day hospital services. The health secretary has questions to answer. How does he plan to pay for it? How will he ensure there isn’t a reduction in mid-week services or fewer doctors on wards Monday to Friday? Yet again there are no answers.

“More than 80 per cent of the public believe that doctors alone cannot deliver seven-day services without proper support, yet the health secretary makes no mention of the extra nurses, diagnostic staff, porters, admin staff – the list goes on – that would be needed to deliver the same high level standard of care patients deserve seven-days a week.

“Doctors believe patients should have access to the same quality of care, seven days a week. If the health secretary wants the same he should be working with us, not setting artificial deadlines and attacking the very people who are the leading advocates for patients, protecting and improving patient care in the face of unprecedented rising demand and funding deficits.

“This is a blatant attempt by the government to distract from its refusal to invest properly in emergency care. So, I say again to the health secretary, get real and show us what you mean.”

For info, I know a lot of people who support various parties, some of whom are members, some of whom habour ambitions of running as Cllrs and MPs. None of them would say they're unprincipled.

I have respect for the SNP's objective to push for separation, but if you're honestly suggesting that they're totally 'principled' (more so than any other party) I'm going to have disagree. The SNP have one objective, which is for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom. 

If they were really as principled as they claimed, they would have told everybody in Scotland to vote Labour at the last election to stop the Conservatives (who are, let's face it, hated in Scotland), because the only way that a Conservative government could be prevented would be through a Labour government. Sturgeon and Salmond are very intelligent politicians and they knew that their campaign strategy in the election would not only win in Scotland, but also make Labour lose in England. They stoked a lot of those arguments very cleverly.

They wanted Labour to lose, because they wanted a Conservative government, because a Conservative government allows them to push their case easier e.g. 'See what happens? You voted to end austerity in your masses, and look what you got - a Tory government!'.

Another example lies with the fox hunting argument. The SNP are so principled, they actually said on their website that they wouldn't vote on English only issues and actually stated fox hunting as one! Fast forward post the election, and they're now saying they will. Why? To cause a headache for the Conservatives over EVEL.

I'm not criticising them for this. I want the Fox Hunting bill to fail and I'm not against Scotland seeking independence either, but to suggest the SNP are somehow more principled than other parties is stuff and nonsense.

Being drunk is never an excuse for being violent towards someone. People should always be responsible for their actions and using alcohol to try and clear your conscience is a crappy and low thing to attempt.  Getting drunk before a crime should not absolve you of it. The full responsibility is on your own head, if you do stupid shit like try to rile up others when drunk then you should never touch a drop again, it doesn't agree with you.

Suarez did this as well, making room for Studge and Sterling.

If he can learn to press from the front, I think we will see the attacking Liverpool side again with 20-30 shots a game. Firmino, Coutinho and Lallana will become great threats if Benteke can occupy two defenders at once. And we'll have Hendo and Milner hanging back, with that drive to hunt down every ball, to pick up loose balls to keep our momentum going.

Remember last season when we would stop City or Chelsea from scoring, just to have them regain possession and build a new attack from our half of the pitch? We will do that next season.


Plus he is a threat in the air. With so many good crossers on our team, I feel confident Benteke will get a few goals.


Is he the right signing? Maybe not, but he makes more sense than Balo and Lambert, even though he's a similar type of player. Plus he's used to the Premier League.

&gt;The frontal lobes are the last part of the brain to develop as we progress through childhood and adolescence, and the first part of the brain to atrophy as we age. Atrophy of the frontal lobes does not diminish intelligence, but it degrades brain areas responsible for inhibiting irrelevant or inappropriate thoughts. Research suggests that this is why older adults have greater difficulty finding the word they're looking for - and why there is a greater likelihood of them voicing ideas they would have previously suppressed.

Interesting in light of recent scandals involving older people making inappropriate remarks in public.

And the 1945 election was unusual - it was the khaki election, the only one we've ever had when half the electorate were in uniform.

That had all sorts of effects - the voting took place abroad, in barracks for the soldiers. The conscripts were sick to the back teeth of war, they'd been grimly at it for four years, killing, seeing friends being killed, not knowing for most of it if we'd even win. The ones in the far east were actually still fighting, would see their colleagues blown up beside them, and then trek back to barracks to cast their vote. They'd taken so many risks by that point they were numb and it seemed they had nothing to lose by rolling the dice and taking one more risk on radical politics.

Another side effect of half the voters being abroad was that they weren't consuming any of the stuff from the press. The Express were calling Attlee something out of the gestapo but our lads deployed in the jungles of Burma didn't see a newspaper for *years*.

There was a reason that Attlee wanted the election so soon after D-day (it was held within three months) and Churchill wanted to wait till everyone was de-mobbed.

When everyone *was* demobbed, normal politics ensued and Labour lost the 1951 election and was then out of power for 13 years.

Back to the future politics don't work because we cannot recreate the conditions of the past. This ought to be obvious but it clearly isn't. So I'll say it again *we cannot recreate the conditions of the past*. And when those conditions applied to a point in time *seventy years ago* in world war conditions - you've gone batshit crazy, love.

I know several MPs who are literally paying to be MPs: their salary and expenses do not cover their costs and those of their family. Contrary the idea of troughing swine who get rich from politics, these people are getting poorer in order to do a job that is an essential component of a functioning democracy. Yes, they volunteer for the job, and there are far more candidates than jobs. But the same is true of doctors, soldiers, police officers and others whose work we also deem vital. We don’t like it when those people suffer real-terms cuts. Why should we allow it for our MPs? Because if we don’t address this soon, the only people who can become MPs will be those with private wealth, those with financial backing from organisations like trade unions, and careerists willing to take a hit while in Parliament in the hope of cashing in during their post-political career.

Well, actually, they don't. They can do as little or as much as they like really. They also pay for staff to handle most of the basic enquiries. It's councillors who usually pick up the day to day public's anger. Mhairi Black will not be looking in to the matter of a constituent's missed bin collection.

How do you mean involved? A good backbencher will be voting in line with the party whip. Their involvement need go no further than going through the correct lobby. And if they are sculpting national legislation, isn't it a bit worrying that they no actual qualifications to do a good job of it?

&gt;What I'm not convinced about is whether we need 650 of the fuckers.

Me neither. I'd move to a proportional representation system with larger constituencies but multiple MPs in each. Or something like that.

However, sovereignty lying with Parliament just means that it is at the top of the power structure. There are other sources of legal power; the courts (both through equity and - as contradictory as it sounds - common law), and the Royal Prerogative. The power to declare war is one of the powers under the Royal Prerogative.

null,false,OoohShinies,null,null,null,"I don't have the exact values but I do have reference texts at work so I can give a rough idea.

Using the info on the supermarket websites Dolmio original is apparently actually only 5.8% sugar. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda &amp; Waitrose all give this value.

Ingredients are: Tomatoes (76%), Tomato Paste (11%), Onions, Sugar, Cornflour, Lemon Juice, Salt, Sunflower Oil, Basil (0.3%), Garlic, Parsley, Herbs, Spices

Using [reference](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/9781849736367) values: Tomatoes (grilled) are 3.4% sugar so that's 2.6g per 100g sauce. Tomato paste (using the value for tomato puree with cooking losses) is 12.9% sugar, so that's another 1.4g. Onions (boiled) are also 4.2% sugar, but the percentage of onion isn't given so I'm going to be lazy and ignore it.

Subtracting the 2.6 and 1.4 from 5.8 leaves you with 1.8% sugar. 

If you use the values on the Dolmio brand website, then it's a total of 8.4% sugar. 

Ingredients are: Tomatoes (76%), Tomato Puree (14%), Lemon Juice, Onion, Sugar, Olive Oil, Salt, Basil, Garlic, Herbs, Parsley, Spices.

Using the same sugar percentages, the tomatoes are still 2.6g, tomato puree is 1.8g. 8.4 minus those is 4.4% sugar. Again a little of that 4.4% will be from the onions.

I have no idea why the values on the supermarkets are so much lower than the Dolmio brand website, or which is correct as I don't have any current packaging for it, but either way as you say lot (or most if you go with the supermarket values) of the sugar is in the tomatoes rather than added.",null,0,null,1437140380,null,0,false,0,ct6iyqs,null,t3_3dlrl1,null,t1_ct6iyqs,null,t1_ct6f694,null,null,null,1437933144,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

As for these *potential* sources being anything close to middle eastern oil reserves you are simply crazy to think that or you didn't actually read the report you're quoting. The extraction costs are barely supported now let alone in the future given the unstable global market prices.

The BGS survey said:

&gt;""Estimates of the amount of recoverable gas and the gas resources are variable. It is possible that the shale gas resources in UK are very large. However, despite the size of the resource, the proportion that can be recovered is the critical factor.""

Furthermore BGS's OWN estimate was 10% or 130 TCF which is fuck all and basically means it's barely worth the infrastructure spending and subsidy. The paragraph above also suggests they don't have high confidence in their estimate of total reserve which was 822 TCF.

 &gt; Most people I know don't tend to make a huge deal out of race.

Some Americans are however surprised by the amount of people in London who don't ""look British"", their attitudes my not be racist but it certainly stands out if there are a lot of comments on the racial mix.

For your reference, only about 60% of Londers are ""white"" and in some areas that number is a LOT lower and those places my not be where you expect. For example a friend of mine took a load of business studies classes in ""Royal Windsor"", which may people may expect to be a largely ""white"" town. I believe she was the only white person in any of her classes, the student body heavily leaning to Indian/Pakistani decent and a lot of West Indies or African decent.

There are spots in North London that are heavily Jewish, there are spots in West London that have some bi-lingual signs (English/Punjabi) because the percentage of people of Pakistani &amp; Indian decent is so high.

We also have a LOT of relatively recently immigrated white Eastern European immigrants working in the service industries. Restaurant &amp; Cafe staff speaking with a strong Polish/Hungarian/Lithuanian accents are totally the norm in much of London now and increasingly common in many cities.

I'm not saying that Markovic, Ings, Ibe and Origi etc wont be getting any game time, but they should all be playing at least 15+ full games a season at this stage of their careers...

We struggle with those sort of teams though, that's proven - so why field an even weaker team than available on purpose just to give our squad players some game time?.

Instead, she did the *abnormal* action of withdrawing her consent to kill the bill. *That* is the constitutional problem right there, that she is able to do that, regardless of who asked her to do it.

I'm not necessarily saying we should give up hope but rather that there is a serious risk of splitting the party and/or making it unelectable well beyond his leadership, however long that may last.

Leaders' impact on their parties outlast their leadership for at least two reasons. Firstly, public perception takes a while to shift and secondly the people they promote to the top tend to stick around for a while. For example, while Kinnock moved away from Foot's positions, he was dogged by a) the memory of the far-left manifesto and b) his close association with Foot and the left of the party, and the continued prominence of much of the left in positions of power.

As to Kinnock's losses, if you go just one election further, you'll notice that Blair went even further to the centre and won spectacularly. There's a pretty clear trend of moving to the centre and then winning, which includes at least the 2010 election for the Tories.

&gt;I'm really tired of people being complete dicks about this when discussing it online. Frankly fuck you - there is no need to be insulting.

Where was I insulting? Also, given that I *wasn't* setting out to insult you, declaring ""Fuck You"" towards me seems a touch ironic.

&gt;The comment you've made above is simply garbage. Look at the estimated primary energy production[1]  , over the next few decades where is Gas? Declining to nothing. What is the major future source? Renewables.

I suppose this shows your sincerity, but confirms the other option of lacking a firm grasp on the topic. Primary energy production is not the same as electricity production. Electricity production doesn't include say, your gas central heating, or your petrol for your car, or anything which isn't electricity but is energy. Also I'm not sure if you've misread the DECC estimates for electricity production, but even their aims shown in the graph you linked show gas electricity production accounting for approximately 20-24% of our electricity generation, which is a huge component.

&gt;As for these potential sources being anything close to middle eastern oil reserves you are simply crazy to think that or you didn't actually read the report you're quoting.

I never said oil reserves, I said gas reserves, come on man....

&gt;Furthermore BGS's OWN estimate was 10% or 130 TCF which is fuck all and basically means it's barely worth the infrastructure spending and subsidy.

Well, firstly, we don't subsidise the oil industry in this country, and secondly, if we recovered 130 TCF that would be approaching us extracting the same as the entire Australian proven gas reserves, which would be huge (Australia having the 12th largest gas reserves in the world).

Any way you slice it, we've got mammoth quantities of gas under our feet and even if only a few percent are extractable we're still talking about very large amounts of gas.",null,0,null,1437142388,null,0,false,0,ct6k2ti,null,t3_3dkeaz,null,t1_ct6k2ti,null,t1_ct6j21o,null,null,null,1437934110,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

And you don't need to be ""IT powerhouses"" for that today. You need to know that government is likely to take an interest, and do a few searches. Or go to a library.

Operational security requirements have not changed all that much in the last 100 years: You want to separate your activities physically from your ""normal"" life and make them hard to connect back to you even if information is intercepted. You want to maintain anonymity. You want to keep cells separate as much as possible. You want to ensure the content of your communication is secure even if intercepted. None of this requires anything fancy, and what you need to understand is your need for secrecy, not anything technical. You can pick up paper books describing everything you need to know written long before computers were invented.

As I pointed out in another comment (search for ""Vula""), the ANC figured out how to apply the basics of technology for this on their own in the 80's, but you can go back much further and use far older techniques and still be secure today.

E.g. you can do it simply by taking physical precautions and using an old fashioned code book or crypto-schemes hundreds of years old. 

You can do vastly better if you understand the technology, but it's not *necessary*. E.g. modern crypto allows you to exchange more data, faster, but using books as one-time-pads is still unbreakable - no matter the supercomputers - if done correctly (don't ever reuse anything; keep the actual key text used a closely guarded secret) and relatively easy to do manually.

Add that to the fact Britain has a pretty strong link between parental income and children's income ([source](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/347915/Elitist_Britain_-_Final.pdf)) - I think there's better ways to attract poor people than increasing the wage. 

Quote from Cameron

&gt;You only have to look at the make-up of the
high levels of parliament, the judiciary, the army, the media.
It's not as diverse; there's not as much social mobility as
there needs to be.

Since the crisis the top earners are growing in wealth. This will mean the disparity will only increase in the coming years.

Most of the public believe 

&gt;it should be
the government’s job to ensure that rich and poor
children have the same chances

By that metric alone they are failing. Not overly sure why that means they get a pay rise. Especially given the ""tough choices"" and ""all in this together"" rhetoric. 

Of course there are plenty of other ways to measure the efficacy of politicians. I just think most people - including myself - have seen an absolute shit show over the passed few years. Lying, cheating, spinning, vicious, back-door, smug and condescending politics from cardboard politicians who don't trust their own people enough to be honest. If any other industry had the public image of ineptitude our politicians do we'd divorce them from any and all public subsidy.

Two people with the same degree, from the same university, doing the same job earning the same wage of £40,000.

Person 1 is paying £2,000 a year in student loans.

Person 2 is paying £0 in student loan because he is younger. 

Person 1 standard of living is reduced to subsidise Person 2 standard of living. Person 1 not only directly paying for his own degree he is having to pay again to pay for Person 2's degree. 

So Person 1 is giving up his standard of living through higher taxes to increase Person 2's standard of living above Person 1.

I mean I agree with you to an extent here as well, I have issues with his commitment to democracy. I don't know I can trust that someone [who launched a scathing attack on someone for supporting proportional representation, whilst supporting FPTP](http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/mehdi-hasan/2010/05/climate-change-jeremy-safe) really has a good handle on what fair, democratic process is...

In terms of legacy, I don't think Corbyn is any worse than any of the other candidates in this respect. Both Yvette and Andy have blood on their hands over the Iraq war and people still remember that (Kendall I will admit has done a pretty good job at avoiding any scrutiny of what her position on the Iraq war was, and, of course, is innocent by default of not being elected until 2010). 

Kendall, whilst I am stepping back from calling her Blue Labour because in the past couple of weeks she has shown she does have Labour principles, I still think her level of capitulation to what the Tories support goes over the mark where it ceases to be a platform that can convince people it's worth changing the current government for. The cutting of working tax credits are currently one of the few measures in the announced budgets that polls have demonstrated the people aren't really getting behind. If there is just one measure she should oppose in the budget, it should be this. If she is not going to take a stance over the measures that are unpopular even amongst Tory voters, then people aren't going to see the point of switching to Labour...

I think, in general, both sides overexaggerate the impact that Corbyn would have on the party, and we should just treat him as any other candidate. Ideally, I would have preferred a ""Nicola Sturgeon""-like figure to be running in this leadership election - the widespread public praise over Mhairi Black's maiden speech from both sides of the political spectrum show the kind of leader people want from a party like ours.",null,0,null,1437143600,null,0,false,0,ct6ksol,null,t3_3dlg0u,null,t1_ct6ksol,null,t1_ct6jxzg,null,null,null,1437934668,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

-The Dloko High School Choir, think they are called Township Voices (I'm biased as I was involved with them last year), they are breathtaking. They are a school choir from a really poor area of south Africa with 10 part harmonies and uplifting music. 

-Thünderbards: comedy duo, short creative sketches. Quite new but every year they get bigger. Cheap as well.

-""you wake up in a dark room"" (or similar name). Like a ""choose"" your adventure story, controlled by the audience. You die and have to go back to the start and remember your route to go down another path. My cousin highly recommends it!

Okay, on to free fringe shows! There are three different free fringe programmes. My favourite is PBH's Free Fringe. This is because the programme is laid out by time, rather than alphabetically. So if it's half one and you're in the royal mile, you just open the programme and look for anything starting at 1.45 or 2.00 that looks good, and go! My favourites from last year:

-Show Pony (I saw this one twice, my boyfriend at the time saw it 3 times and commuted from Glasgow each time it was so funny)

-Red Redford (young stand up comedian, really nice guy and funny recurring jokes)

-A guy in the banshee labyrinth at midnight who had a hat of all the sins he's ever committed, can't remember his name though! Each audience member pulled a slip of paper out of the hat and read it out, then he told the shameful stories. Really funny and cringey.

-will seawards spooky ghost stories

That's all I can remember from last year!

Basically just go through the book- each year I think I've just sat down with some music on and gone through it cover to cover, at least the comedy section. Highlight anything that pops out at you. They're annoying, but collect leaflets as well. If you have nothing to do and you're wandering around the cowgate and a free fringe performer flyers you, I'd just go for it.

I am a landlord with a BTL property. I've been a landlord since 2010.

A few points regarding your situation.

Buying a property is a good idea, property is a good investment, particularly over the medium-long term it is almost guaranteed to go up in value.

If you can obtain a mortgage I'd suggest you go with it, obviously you will need to keep up repayments on this, renting is a viable answer to doing this. However, I would caution you, whatever you think you are going to make from rent, it will be less than your lowest expectations.

If you are planning using the rent to pay your mortgage, it is unlikely that the rent will cover the mortgage for the first 2 years, and your other renting costs (repairs, agent fees etc.)

Like others have said BTL is not a good way of making a return, the return on this comes in the form that someone else pays your mortgage (or most of it). Therefore at the end of 25-30 years you have a property and haven't paid much for it. If you aren't willing to commit to this sort of term investment then it might be better to put your £5k in an ISA and wait a few years.

* Keep a log of everything. Who you speak to, when you speak to them and roughly what they say. Write this down ASAP or records as it happens - the more accurate and contemporaneous the records the better.

* Work out how much this is costing you. The bank, assuming this is their mistake, is obligated to make sure you don't lose out financially. Once you get your accounts bank and access to the original money they should also compensate you for whatever extra cost you have incurred dealing with this in the mean time (e.g. cost of phone calls).

null,false,DukePPUk,null,null,null,"Consent isn't the same as Royal Assent - which the report makes clear. Royal Assent is a formality; a standard procedure that doesn't involve her at all (these days), and happens when a bill has passed both Houses (or just the Commons, in some cases).

Consent happens before the second reading stage; Parliamentary procedure states that no bill affecting the Crown's powers can be debated (or have a second reading) without the Consent of the Queen (or in some cases, the Duke of Cornwall). So an MP or Lord wishing to put forward such a bill has to go to the relevant Government department and ask them to seek permission from the Queen to get their bill debated. And the Queen gives permission if the Government ~~tells~~ advises her to.

So if she had given permission, she would have done so against the advice of the Government - and that's a constitutional problem because the Queen isn't supposed to exercise her constitutional powers on her own (iirc it is against Parliamentary rules for anyone to even refer to her opinion on a matter during a debate); she is supposed to do what she is told. The same goes with appointing a Prime Minister, summoning a new Parliament - all those other powers technically held by the monarch.

The Consent procedure is archaic and weird, and quite disturbing. In theory, though, it is a courtesy, whereby Parliament doesn't debate anything affecting the Queen without checking with her that it is Ok (preventing any potential awkwardness); in practice it has become a way for the Government to block quietly any bill affecting their powers (as they control most of the Crown's powers) that they don't want.

&gt; And obviously they knew this was a controversial move otherwise they wouldn't have hidden it away until it was forced into the light by a court order.

I'm not sure what this is referring to. Consent has been around for a very long time, and iirc when a bill does get Consent there is a public record of that. I don't think a court could get involved as it is Parliamentary procedure, so protected by the Bill of Rights.",null,0,null,1437144538,null,0,false,0,ct6ldmk,null,t3_3dlicm,null,t1_ct6ldmk,null,t1_ct6jvum,null,null,null,1437935164,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Realistically to hide your plots you'd try to avoid computers at every turn, and if necessary communications would be kept separate from devices that can be linked to yourself and then encrypted as much as possible to prevent the revealing of information if intercepted.

However, the data you may send to people who you are colluding with has to pass through *somewhere* to reach the recipient, and the hope is that this information can be caught, and if needed, decrypted to find out necessary information.

VPNs are great at creating a mask for example, but it isn't impossible to follow a trail, just like any encryption tool isn't perfect. I remember hearing talks about the US government getting backdoors to encryption services provided to them for this purpose exactly, and that is another matter entirely on it's own! I digress, my point is that yes, people can use a lot of methods to cover their tracks and mask the data they are sending to minimise the potential risk of using a computer to pass information and communicate, but when the government is catching all of the data they can then they have one less barrier to overcome when they actually need to try and find critical data.

&gt; Weak on defence

As someone pointed out at the Leeds hustings, a nuclear deterrent is absolutely pointless when your main enemy is a free-flowing, rapidly expanding _idea_.  We can't end ISIS by nuking them.  Sure, we have tensions in Russia too, but a) they're quite nebulous at the moment from a UK threat point of view, b) we're hardly the only nation that'll be affected, and c) is there anything we can't just solve with conventional warfare?

Everything else is paper tigers, really.  I don't see how we defend ourselves by thrusting weapons of mass destruction in people's faces and daring them to defy us.  We're not even that internationally relevant anymore, and there are people dying on the streets that the Trident money could easily go towards helping, provided we can sort out the issues of job losses and international commitments.

&gt; Giving the impression that we are more concerned with those who won’t work, who can work, I don’t think is a way that we’re going to be able to win over people.

For f**k's sake I'm sick and tired of this dichotomy coming from the Tories, let alone Labour.  If we're going to champion the welfare state, we need to point out that there are people who genuinely do need it--and there _are_ people who genuinely need it--and they're being given a rough ride by people cherry-picking genuine systematic abuses and trying to paint everyone like that.

If we don't want to give that impression, how about we engage in a conversation with voters about all these utterly baseless assumptions that the Tories and the media (don't argue that the media is blameless in all this, we have things like Benefits Street and Immigration Street that are turning mild-mannered working-class people into frothing hate machines that'll happily throw their own peers under the bus) have got people to believe in, instead of either burying our head in the sand and pretending they aren't there or assuming that the electorate are utterly immovable by any sort of argument whatsoever?  (Hat off to Tom Watson, who's already _doing_ this)

&gt; Giving the impression that we want to beat up on your employer, who gives you your pay and your hours every week, I don’t think is a particularly good look either.

Again, false dichotomy.  We don't have to choose between calling all employers evil blood-suckers or saintly wealth creators to whom everyone, including people on desperately shitty contracts or workfare or zero-hours, should prostrate and thank for their bottomless charity.  Truth is there are good employers and bad employers, and as the party of workers Labour should reward the good and punish the bad.

Also, this is an image concern rather than an ideological one IMO: a lot of people in Labour have already gone on record as saying that they (and many voters!) agreed with Ed's policies on zero-hours contracts, but hated the 'predators and producers' rhetoric.",null,0,null,1437144996,null,0,false,0,ct6lo5b,null,t3_3dikl9,null,t1_ct6lo5b,null,t3_3dikl9,null,null,null,1437935409,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

This is more or less, what the players positions' were in attack last year. Willian would cut inside, and Ivanovic would provide the width on the right. While on the left, Hazard would be in a more wide position, but capable of cutting inside, and letting Azpi make overlapping runs, although that's not something he did too often. Fabregas would be quite literally in the center of the pitch dictating play with his passing, and you can see the triangle that he creates with Oscar and Willian. Matic just kind of acts as a shielder of the back 4 against counter-attacks, and as you can see Cahill is holding a high line, and there is a lot of ground for him to cover. It's why Willian is so important, as he has to cover all that gruond when the ball is lost when Ivanovic is that far forward.

The one thing the Tories are good at which Labour are fairly rubbish (with the exception of Blair) at, is controlling the public narrative. Even when their policies are causing the economy to tank, they are able to convince people that they are the best option for the stability of the nation. 

We've seen that with the recent budget announcement. Throughout the election campaign, they said that Labour's campaign for a higher minimum wage, to end non-dom status and control rents would absolutely wreck the economy. Yet they were able to work these ideas into the budget and receive universal praise for it.

It's this power of using doublespeak to convince people your ideological views  will only benefit them, convincing people you will protect hard-working families whilst slashing their budgets. The announcement of the new national living wage made people completely forget that this is entirely counteracted by the complete slashing of working tax credits.  Being able to convince people that they should accept government surveillance. They are dangerously competent at adopting their narrative.

Now for all you can possibly say about Thatcher, she was absolutely brilliant at this, so brilliant in fact that she practically destroyed the left-wing movement for at least a generation.

In theory, a left-wing Labour wing labour could bring the people around, if only their leader was as brilliant at spinning the narrative as Thatcher was. Scotland has shown this is possible, Nicola Sturgeon managed to unite both the left and right under a pro-nationalist, left-wing, anti-austerity banner. And for all his flaws, despite not being Tory, Farage was able to sway the public narrative towards an anti-immigration, anti-EU platform. Sadly I don't think any of the leader candidates for Labour are capable of spinning the public narrative in their direction. 

To win an election, you need to be able to convince people that your way is the right way. This doesn't require you to conform to the leading narrative, it requires you to absolutely sell your narrative at all points whilst completely demolishing all opposing narratives - not just in the run-up in the election but in the entire parliamentary term. This is where Labour has failed, and where it will continue to fail unless either the Tories falter so hard that no amount of spin can allow them to recover, or (the safer bet) Labour elects a leader whose narrative voice is so strong they blast away the Tories. 

EDIT tl;dr It doesn't matter what platform you stand on, all that matters is that you are able to convince people that it is the only platform worth listening to.

EDIT2: Uncharacteristically (for me), I'm actually going to quote Liz Kendall on this:

&gt; We could have stopped the suffering that Thatcher imposed on communities across Britain had we been a credible alternative rather than simply a party of protest.

&gt; Labour's fundamental mistake back then meant we were powerless to stop the Conservatives decimating families and tearing our communities apart.

Whilst she doesn't mean it the way I am presenting it, her words are correct - regardless of whether we run a left-wing, right-wing or centrist platform, the only way you can stop the Tory spin machine is to throw a spanner in to break the cogs and then replace it with your own spin machine. Standing on the sidelines and just idly moaning that the Tory spin machine is wrong isn't going to cut it. The Tories have a majority of just 12, and already there are signs of discontent on their backbenches, breaking the Tory machine shouldn't be that hard if we poke at it enough. Then it's just a case of running a better spin machine before the Tories can fix theirs...",null,0,null,1437145362,null,0,1437148847,0,ct6lwl3,null,t3_3dlg0u,null,t1_ct6lwl3,null,t1_ct6id6m,null,null,null,1437935560,null,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

Go back to the initial Guardian article I referenced. In it, it says that the government had just lost the court battle to keep the details of what the Queen consented to or vetoed a secret. That was why all that stuff was made public only relatively recently.

How is it not already a constitutional problem that the Queen is given a power that she's not supposed to use, but instead allows herself to be used by the government in order to do things the government isn't supposed to do? That's not a constitutional problem?

Her refusing to follow their ""advice"" (also bullshit - how is it advice if it is mandatory?) would only draw attention to the fact that there already is a constitutional problem.

If this had been Man U fans singing songs about Hillsborough in a Liverpool bar, the reaction would have been the same. Vice versa, if it was Liverpool fans singing songs about Munich in a Manchester bar, the reaction would have been the same. If it had been Rangers fans singing songs about the famine in a Celtic bar, the reaction would have been the same (oh wait....). Vice versa, if it was Celtic fans singing songs about the IRA in a Rangers bar, the reaction would have been the same. But I don't think that Celtic fans are 1: that fucking stupid, or 2: that fucking arrogant to think they could do it and walk away from it.

These fucking morons went into a bull pen waving a red rag around and were dealt with exactly as is to be expected. Most people laud the bull when it maims or gores someone stupid enough to be running down a narrow alley in front of it. Instead we have hippies getting upset that some moronic fuck lost part of his ear. Maybe he'll wake up from surgery and consider the fact that he's only missing part of his ear a blessing. But I doubt it. He'll inevitably end up playing the victim to the tyranny of those dirty Fenians who would dare attack him for singing about his culture.

Who in their right mind walks into someone else's manor and starts throwing their weight around, without considering the possibility that they might not walk out again?

In June the High Court ruled that [the law was unlawful](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/19/music-groups-win-court-battle-private-copying-cds) because of problems with the Government's consultation - it hadn't collected the required evidence.

Today the High Court followed that up with [an order quashing the law entirely](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2015/2041.html). The Government's position seems to be that while they could fix this quite easily (they know what evidence they need), they don't really want to.

My big problem with their wage and specifically them getting a pay raise is the rest of the public sector isn't getting anything even remotely similar. Why is an PM worth so much more - both in absolute wage and in percentage raise - than a teacher or a nurse or many other workers out there? They are all vital. I don't think you can say an MP is more important that a teacher/nurse - without any of them society will break down.

Should a teacher not be paid somewhere at least close to an MP? For what reason is a teacher worth considerably less than an MP? Why do MPs, who earn roughly double what a teacher earns, get a significant pay raise while teachers get nothing or 1%? Feel free to replace teacher for any number of other public sector job. I generally feel nurses and teachers get the worst of it so I tend to use them as an example.

You can't say MPs should get 10% but no one else should. Most people would say they should be paid more than they are, and many would be right - that doesn't mean it is sustainable for the business/country. 

You either come out in support of 10% for MPs and 10% for teachers/nurses/etc, or you come out in support for 1% for all of them. If you pick the former you have to find the cash in the budget and I wish you good luck in that.

MPs don't have to either. But, if you like, just choose any other job that involves significant travelling/unsociable hours. It's not a reason in itself to pay MPs a larger salary on that basis. Also, they don't actually have to be in the House of Commons all the time. They're not forced to be down in London constantly.

&gt;How exactly do you think they got elected in the first place?

Bwaha! You think they get elected by dealing with the public? They're usually members of political parties from a young age who enter the party machinery to become MPs. They don't get selected by the general public, they get selected by representatives of their own political party. Once a Labour candidate is chosen for...say...Barnsley, they're just the Labour candidate and not an individual. Sure, they might do some door knocking prior to the election but, other than that, you won't really hear from them.

&gt;And nor should she, that's a local matter.

Exactly, so what is she getting involved with the public on? National matters where she'll just defer to the SNP policy. If she receives correspondence on an item, she'll simply arrange for a suitable response in line with the party. She may even have a member of her support staff write it.

This confuses me - are they saying, they would be suppressed by the brain, as in, the person wouldn't actual have the same beliefs - or are they saying that they would have previously kept their ideas to themselves.

If it's the latter, that suggests that the person still does or doesn't have the particular belief, just that they hide it - not that the lobe atrophy caused them to have the belief in the first place.

Each of the candidates so far will alienate at least one bit of Labour.  It's the one disadvantage of our broad-church system.  But we're all in this for the same reason, I like to think, so the correct response is to stick together, give the winner of the election a combination of support and critique (whoever wanted Echo Chamber Labour?), and if you really think the leader's had it then there's always the next leadership election to prepare for.

&gt; Blair won 3 elections. Red Ed moved left, moving FUTHER in the wrong direction won't work

'Red Ed' was only a fraction towards the left of Blair.  His problem was more that he didn't give a convincing account of _what_ he stood for and _how_ he'd make the country a better place.  Admittedly he did much better in the closing days of the election and came out as IMO a beacon of relative honesty and conviction, but by then Labour was doomed to lose simply because nobody knew _what_ it stood for.

Maybe you're right.  Maybe we are moving in the wrong direction.  But polling suggests that a lot of left-wing policies are favoured by the electorate, so I don't think it's as simple as loss by ideology.

Thatcher won 3 elections too.  Should we emulate Thatcher?

&gt; He voted 500 times AGAINST Labour, doesn't exactly make him a unifying figure

Labour gets things wrong too.  It got a lot of things wrong in the Blair years (Iraq being the most objective example, as well as failing to regulate the banks).  Even people on the right must see that Labour isn't infallible, or else you wouldn't criticise it for overspending!

Labour needs someone who'll battle its failures with actions, not 'I'm sorry, I'm so so sorry' words.  We had too much of the latter in 2015.  How about trying the former?

&gt; Well he can put Labour out of contention for 20 YEARS

Please elaborate as to why?

&gt; Read: attack everyone and everything

Things need attacking.  I think equating 'vested interests' with 'everyone and everything' is a bit hyperbolic.

&gt; With 80% income tax the only aspiration will be to leave the country...

The rushing of the rich to the 'raise taxes and we'll leave' banner is a threat that pays off simply because nobody ever calls their bluff.  Sure, some people might leave, but there is more to being in the UK than favourable taxes--family, friends, business colleagues, a large market, a common culture and language, some or all of which would be lost by leaving the country.

&gt; How will he do that in opposition

Implying that he'll be an eternal opposition without any substance as to why.  Your reasoning?

This article also just wreaks of resentment towards Levy. Are people really still harping on him for not spending enough money, even after the summer of the Beatles, even though we clearly need to spend wisely due to the new stadium, just like Arsenal had to do for 5-6 years? And to say the one good thing ENIC has done is develop youth doesn't make sense. Our youth has become a factor only in this past year, and I understand that it has been developing for a bit, but prior to this, who was starting for us that came up from our academy? And regardless, there are many things ENIC has done that are worth applause...like the fact that under them we have done most consistently well since the 60's.  

Scott Parker is an example of a bad captain? The guy might not have been the best player, but holy fuck did he run his heart out every single game. And by most accounts, Poch did not necessarily pick Kaboul but the players picked him.

Players like Mata and Di Maria and stirling and Bale and even sigi all make excellent contributions on the left/right. And I don't think Eriksen is so much different player from those. They all might play better in the middle but that doesn't mean they can't play well outside as well.

So what I am suggesting is that you take a small hit on not fully optimising Eriksen, but you get big gains by playing dembele in an advanced role which has two effects:

* Dembele puts pressure on the defensive players much better than Eriksen forcing mistakes and turn overs high up the pitch, he also reads the interceptions well.
* Dembele's dribbling becomes SUPER dangerous. now when he dribbles past 2 players makes ten meters and makes that horrizontal pass (the one we normally cringe about when he does this from halfway), he is passing to either kane/eirksen/Lamela(or relevent subs) at the top of the box and those passes are super dangerous.

I think demebele gets more dangerous up there especially with the likes of eriksen and lemela (who both like that no.10 spot) running in to support him and receive that dangerous pass and hopefully shot/flick into kanes feet, either way resulting in lots of good scoring opportunities.

Some of that is magical Spurs christmasland. but it was happening like that either side of christmas last year.",null,0,null,1437146671,null,0,false,0,ct6mr9h,null,t3_3dilpr,null,t1_ct6mr9h,null,t1_ct6g06u,null,null,null,1437936227,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

You blamed the SNP when you said:

Either it'd have made a difference and it's the SNP's fault Labour lost because they didn't tell everyone to vote Labour, or it wouldn't have made a difference and your entire argument is void.

We were wrong to do the latter all the way up to Question Time then suddenly U-turn and insist we were right all along.

We were wrong to come up with incredibly vague 'policies' then inscribe them on an 8ft plinth as a publicity stunt.  We were wrong to visit Russell Brand weeks after close of registration.  We were wrong to offer the voters nothing for four years and then everything in the last one.  We were wrong to let our pitch become 'vote Labour, win a microwave' (with apologies to whomever came up with that brilliant summary).

We were wrong to count the number of conversations we were having with voters, and not the substance of them.

We were wrong to join Better Together on the Tories' terms, alienating swathes of Scottish voters even if we won the referendum.  We were wrong to tell the electorate they couldn't be trusted with an EU referendum.  We were wrong to walk into a trap of nationalism on one side and nationalism on the other.

We were wrong to treat Labour like something that pops up at election then disappears for four years out of five.  We were wrong to take our core voters for granted.  We were wrong to assume they wouldn't become disillusioned with mainline politics.

I won't pretend to be a long-suffering fan - I've only been a City supporter since ~2008 and all I knew about soccer back then was United was such a known team and it was natural that I wanted to cheer for the ""other"" Manchester team - but this was nothing short of magical.",null,0,null,1437146843,null,0,false,0,ct6mvjo,null,t3_3dmfd3,null,t1_ct6mvjo,null,t3_3dmfd3,null,null,null,1437936322,null,24,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,24,null

&gt;Either it'd have made a difference and it's the SNP's fault Labour lost because they didn't tell everyone to vote Labour, or it wouldn't have made a difference and your entire argument is void.

You seem to be working under the misapprehension that I'm a Labour voter. I'm looking at it neutrally, not through the eyes of a political party. All I'm saying is that if the SNP really wanted the Conservatives out, they wouldn't have caused Labour the issues they did by fanning the flames. 

I maintain that it is excellent for the SNP that the country currently has a Tory government as it furthers the argument for Scottish independence, and I believe that Sturgeon hoped for that before the election (if she didn't, she wouldn't be a very good politician, and she's a very good politician).

null,false,Dardanator,null,null,null,"I think the snp could have easily taken a different route to Scottish nationalism and extended their appeal to the rest of the UK by standing in more seats and potentially forming a government. This would have allowed them to fix all the problems they have with the UK rather than taking Scotland down a path of great uncertainty and risk, helping significantly fewer in the process. There are a number of reasons people hate the snp but their nationalism and desire to break up this country is by far the dominant factor. They've won over the people of Scotland and completely replaced the labour party as the left wing option in the space of a decade with a simple winning formula of populism and relative competence. All the people who support them for that reason aren't going to go away if they set aside nationalism and focus on becoming a bigger force in UK politics outside of Scotland. Yet that winning formula would easily appeal to so many in the rest of the UK, and ceasing to be a nationalist party would remove the most substantial reason people hate them.

With all that being the case, it's frustrated me that they remain a nationalist, pro independence party when they could easily do something much better by seeking to govern the UK and change it for the better. Nicola knows she could become PM if she tried. I don't realistically see them doing such a thing, but things like this make me think there are people in the party who would be open to it. Mhairi Black strikes me as someone who joined the party and stood as an MP for social issues rather than anything to do with nationalism.

Look at Tourette's syndrome.  AFAIK, in Tourettes - it's not so much that people secretly think the things they blurt out loud - it's more that they're unable to contain those thoughts which we all internally classify as 'taboo'.  

I don't have tourettes, but I can sometimes feel my brain do something similar.  I will think of what would be the most inappropriate thing to say in a given situation.  Maybe it's just anxiety, in which I think of the worst thing that could happen.

And of course - there's the whole argument about whether drunk people really mean what they say.  Is alcohol just revealing your hidden thoughts - or is it unleashing mental demons, getting you to say things that you don't really believe?

She says that many of Corbyn's policies have wide public support, but the only example she can give is renationalising the railways, which, even if it's a good idea, we literally cannot afford to do. 

And she also ignores the fact that simply proposing a list of policies that people support in the abstract is not actually an effective path to victory. Perceptions of parties shape perceptions of policies, and vice versa. The best research on this centres around the Tory campaign in 2005, wherein the Tories said quite a lot of stuff that voters agreed with in the abstract, but which voters rejected when they were presented to them by the ""nasty"" Tory party.

Likewise with Labour, if we present a costly, stereotypically left-wing policy to the electorate, even if voters agree with it in the abstract they will see it through the lens of Labour's alleged profligacy and Corbyn's far-left origins, and likely reject it.


Moving on from that line, she seems to think that Trident is massively unpopular, which is the exact opposite of the truth.

Then she goes on to criticise centrist/""Blairite"" figures like Chuka for telling the party to 'take its medicine' - i.e. to do things that are unpalatable in order to win power. This is an incredibly stupid analogy, because when someone's telling you to take your medicine you should probably do it if you want to get better. What's the alternative? Sweat out your fever? Maybe Corbyn would rather we use homoeopathy...

She acknowledges that the purported centre ground has moved to the right over the past five years, but doesn't actually deal with this reality. She seems to want to shift the centre ground back leftwards, even further to the left than it was before.

She ignores the reality that the Tories were able to shift the centre ground to the right mainly because they were in power for five years, and had the right-wing press parroting their every line. 

Likewise, when we were in power we were able to shift the public discourse leftwards. Yes, even under Tony Blair. The minimum wage, SureStart, paternity pay, equal rights, devolution, etc. etc. are all now part of the accepted status quo. We were only able to achieve that remarkable shift in public opinion because we had access to the levers of power.

So if we ever want to be able to shift the discourse leftwards again, we need to be in government. 

She says ""the centre is an ever-shifting territory that is captured by the person with the strongest rhetoric,"" as if strong rhetoric is all that is needed. What is needed is power. We have known this to be true since the Fabians were founded 134 years ago.

She says that ""the Labour Party wins when they articulate a message of hope"". So, now she's completely abandoned talking about winning policies (which Corbyn doesn't appear to have) and has moved on to talking about hopeful rhetoric.

Sure, hope is important, but it isn't enough. Ed Miliband's core message for the general election was the hopeful, ""Britain can be Better"". Articulating hope is not enough: you need to prove to the electorate that their hopes - dare I say their aspirations? - can actually be achieved without wrecking what they already have. A bird in hand, etc.

She says that the one thing that made Blair an electoral success was the fact that he was ""incredibly hopeful"", as if his centrist policies (which she apparently despises) had nothing to do with it. Blair was successful specifically because he acknowledged that the centre ground had shifted over the 10+ years of Tory rule, and he moved Labour on to it. She is trying to appropriate the mantle of Blairism for Corbyn while rejecting its core lesson.

And then she finishes by talking about Syriza while totally eliding the fact that Tsipras's far-left rhetoric and flamboyant posturing has left the average working-class Greek person in dire straits and cost the left its legitimacy in the minds of the Greek people.


Oh, and she completely elides the initial question: whether Corbyn is actually electable.

I'm not sure there are any widely accepted answers to these. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are regarded as countries simply because enough people say that they are, and I don't think that's a problem. But I don't think it's sufficient grounds for being a country to have any special meaning either. Scotland and England are certainly not countries in the same way France and Germany are. Furthermore, I think the acts of union made clear in their wording that two countries were being merged into one (ie, the union was a single event in time rather than an ongoing political union).

One strange thing I find is that out of the four constituent parts of the UK, Northern Ireland is the one that functions most like a country in its own right. It's had substantial self government for nearly a century, manages infrastructure like railways entirely independently of the British government, issues its own driving licences and has a vastly different political system to the rest of the UK. Yet it is far less widely considered a country compared to England, Wales or Scotland. The ISO defines it as a province unlike the other three which it calls countries. The reason for this of course is the controversial nature of NI's status, to call it a country would piss off those who consider Ireland as a whole to be one country and NI no different to the rest of it, or those who don't want to consider it as being separate to the rest of the UK.

I went out drinking one night during college.  Huge bender (or, for me, Saturday Night) at a place in NYC open till 4 AM.  Being a (formerly) heavy drinker, I was pretty friendly with all the bar staff and one of the owners.

I got so totaled I fell asleep on one of the couches that lined the back area.

The place was THE bar to go to watch football matches since it opened at 7 and even hosted a number of the area supporters clubs.

You're right in thinking that courts can't usually overturn parliamentary statute.

What they can do though, through a process called judicial review, is review legislation to see if it clashes with other legislation and so 'disapply' sections of statutes which they deem to be incompatible with superior law.

You're convinced there's nothing Labour could have done to win without the SNP supporting them in Scotland:

&gt;&gt;They could have done better and come out ahead of the tories despite the SNP's success in Scotland.

&gt;I can see no way they could do that, particularly, without a change in leader well in advance of the election and that leader would have had to have been someone of significant credibility. Alan Johnson, possibly.

You've also said the SNP were fanning the flanning the flames and stoking the fire of Labour's issues.  Either you think Labour could have won if the SNP hadn't been doing this, or the SNP doing this is not evidence that the SNP wanted to see Labour lose in England.

&gt;You seem to be working under the misapprehension that I'm a Labour voter. I'm looking at it neutrally, not through the eyes of a political party. 

I've made no such assumption.  Are you making assumptions about how I voted and my motivations for doing so?

&gt;All I'm saying is that if the SNP really wanted the Conservatives out, they wouldn't have caused Labour the issues they did by fanning the flames.

Or...maybe the SNP wanted the Conservatives out but didn't think Labour would fail so spectacularly to do their part in England.  The number of polls that showed Labour gaining more seats than the Conservatives far outnumbered the opposite until much nearer election day.


&gt;I maintain that it is excellent for the SNP that the country currently has a Tory government as it furthers the argument for Scottish independence, and I believe that Sturgeon hoped for that before the election (if she didn't, she wouldn't be a very good politician, and she's a very good politician).

So how far do her lies go?  Did her MPs hope for the same?  Did SNP party members hope for the same?  And *all* of them kept telling us they wanted the Tories out?  Talk about incredible party cohesion!

Is it so inconceivable that the SNP just wanted to offer Scots a voice in Westminster that wasn't whipped into line by the party headquarters in England?

&gt;I notice you're not commenting on the fox hunting issue, by the way. Is that because it isn't principled?

I don't agree with their decision to vote. I understand and appreciate their motivation for doing so but think it was a mistake.

- Child is missing, and phone is off. Retained geolocation data gives the last location the child was at.
- Seize terrorist laptop, has IM messages to user account x. Retained data allows you to get the src IP of x from the IM service at a given date/time. Request to ISP gets you the physical address of IP x at that time. If a mobile device, this could include geo data. Do that enough, combined with geo data for each message, and you could identify the owner of the phone even if it is a burner.
- Known meeting of terrorists occurred at location X, but you only hear about it a period of time afterward. Using retained data, you can find all other phones active at that geolocation at that time.

There are lots of other examples. Note though that just the fact that something is _useful_ doesn't make retention necessary or proportionate. For example, in e.g. 1 above (the child one), the same result could be attained from retained data of just the last few pings, rather than 12 month retention.

As for the argument that technically competent adversaries will always be able to hide, people are partially correct, and they're partially actually arguing against themselves. Firstly, people screw up - look at the admin of Silk Road, or the russian soldiers instagraming from Ukraine. Secondly, it's only as people get closer to doing a criminal act that they get hardcore about OpSec - so having longer term retention actually makes it more likely you'll detect their actions. For example, a person in the process of being radicalised won't have burner phones, won't use TOR, etc. When they start doing so, they are likely to have been radicalised, and/or are considering skipping to Syria or doing something bad.

Once you arrive there will be some small local shops and depending where you are living in the city some larger national chain supermarkets. Sainsbury's in Sidney Street is the most central, while larger supermarkets like Tesco and Asda are slightly further out from the city centre.

For coffee shops it depends again on where you live. In the centre you'll find chain coffee shops like Starbucks, Costa and Caffé Nero scattered throughout town and some smaller independent shops like Hot Numbers (on Trumpington Street near junction of that street and Lensfield Road).
