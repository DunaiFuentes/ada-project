I mean this is basically my view, abortions aren't a good thing, they reduce fertility they are associated with risky sexual practices from a health perspective (not using condoms etc) and they can really fuck up the mental health of the women who have them. I do think they are a necessary evil but they are in no way at all a good thing! Voting in policies which would help reduce the abortion rate in the UK is *of course* a good thing. Are there really people who want there to be *more* abortions?! 

Pro choice is just that, **choice** that means that women shouldn't feel like they *should* have an abortion when ideally they would not want one. Pro choice is about supporting women so they can have children and still get access to higher education, not have motherhood impact their career, get support with child care, give fathers more time off to support their partners etc. 

Reducing the abortion rate isn't about restricting access to abortions its about supporting mothers so they don't feel the need to abort.

He would also be a waste on the bench if Ward-Prowse is to be first-choice playmaker. Then there is Hesketh as back up and also the potential of Clasie to be considered in that position as well (imagine if Morgan stays and Clasie is still brought in OR Clasie playing ahead of Wanyama + Reed).

null,false,vzzzbux,null,null,null,"&gt; No, it isn't. It's a hypocritical attempt to make strikes illegal without actually doing so.

Can't agree. Some strikes have deeper effects than just their members, like millions of Londoners who are affected when the RMT throw their dolly out of the pram because their members' payrises aren't large enough, or because they want a bonus for minimal or no extra work just because the Olympics are on, or in support of a sacked colleague despite the formal processes not being completed yet.

Why can't it be the case that strike action only happens if a significant minority vote for it?

And comparisons to elections don't work, given that there are multiple options and much more apathy (people will vote for something that directly affects them or their job)

&gt;  e.g. online - like we keep asking them to.

This is something that should be considered in addition to those measures, to make it easier for someone to vote.

&gt; However, trying to equate the human rights record of a party that enshrined them in British law with a party trying to abolish that law is straightforwardly wrong.

I'll assume that your flair suggests a bit of bias, but the reality is that so far Labour have demonstrated much more in the area of curtailing civil liberties than the Conservatives have. The HRA is eclipsed by stuff like RIPA, stop and search, CCA, 28/42 day detention without charge, or the things Snowden has revealed that happened in the GCHQ under Labour

I decided it would be nice to go to London for one day with the kids, wife and parents in law and visit one of the museums. In the past we have gone multiple times to the National History museum, so I wanted to go somewhere else. I stupidly suggested the British Museum, as none of us had been before. First thing we wanted to see were the Marbles. As soon as we got to them I could see her parents getting angry. Complaining that the Marbles should not be here. Looking at them for a long time getting more and more upset. Even bumping into some other Greeks and starting an agitated discussion in Greek. While they were doing this, I was trying to control our two boys (5 and 2) who got bored within 15 minutes and just wanted to go to some other museum or at least spend their time running around, rather than look at old stone sculptures. We spent about 3 hours there. None of us enjoyed the trip. A £100 for the train well spent.

SNP - Sudden rise

Problem we have right now is more than 60% of the SNP membership joined during a 6 month period.  Questions if that sudden growth is a good thing or bad thing and if the SNP can keep up with the maintenance required. Far too simplistic or early to say the SNP have a strong grip on Scotland. That just giving up before we even start to challenge the SNP. We could not have forecast the sudden wave of SNP support and counter it in time.  What we should do is learn from the SNP and how they been able to rise and get certain voters voting again. May be a good case for rethinking how Labour works within Scotland. 

UKIP voters

This block of voters feeds into the next section and we should look at engagement.  Most don't feel like any of the other parties have the same sort of engagement with them as UKIP. UKIP voters are made up of a couple different groups but they all suffer from a lack of engagement. 

Don't vote/left behind

This group again suffer from a lack of engagement and on average are likely to be Labour voters. 

What Labour needs to do is convince voters that it serious about engagement with them and to start talking to them in a way which connects to them.  The number of voters who care about the SNP are far smaller compared to the non voting camp. We already seen that once the tone along with narrative rather hard to counter.  Best answer would be that we always had to work together parties always do. 
Unsure that a convincing answer to that question which is hard to answer.

My *guess* is they came from the Conservatives because:

- There was a strong message to Conservative voters to vote tactically for UKIP in Labour strongholds so as to send a message.

Don't give up quite so quickly; the burden of proof is on *them* to prove that it was you, remember.  If you can introduce any reasonable doubt that you were driving at the time, then plead not guilty.

&gt;(namely the part that says there was no records of my car speeding on the ANPR cameras, or the PNC).

If I read correctly, this is a reference to your report of cloned plates to your local force.  What this means is that they have no images of your registration plate from any ANPR cameras at all, and therefore no leads to find the cloned plates, which is why they closed the case.  ANPR cameras do not record speed, they only read number plates (and in some cases, take pictures).  PNC is just a police record system which holds the details of (among other things) vehicle keepers; again, what they likely meant was that there was no record of your cloned vehicle having been stopped, involved in a pursuit, etc.

&gt;I understand that - the reason I didn't fill out the form initially was that I either had to admit liability or nominate someone who was driving at the time. Since I wasn't driving, and nobody else could have been driving (I leave the keys in my room, with the door to my room locked while I sleep), this was impossible.

Have you looked at the form?  Usually they will have a portion where you are able to claim one of the two statutory defences available to failing to nominate a driver (that nominating a driver is impossible or impractical despite the keeper's due diligence).  You can go to court and plead not guilty based on this defence ([RTA 1988, S. 172 subsection 4](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/172)).

&gt;would [a road traffic offence] count as a [declarable] criminal conviction?

Yes, I think you can. Social workers are often on the receiving end of anger and violence, I remember reading a survey that had found 9 out of 10 have been assaulted verbally or physically and 1 in 5 felt unsafe most of the time whilst working. But their jobs are to help and in order to do so the avoidance of an ""us vs them"" mentality is absolutely imperative.


The same is true of police. As public servants and highly trained professionals they absolutely need and should be expected to avoid thinking in terms of ""us vs them"" for them to effectively do their jobs.

To me, Gallifrey was never burned. War Doctor was sure that's what was happening so that's what he remembered to have happened.

Apparently, when multiple Doctors get together, the timelines get all loopy and no one can remember anything. They mention that in 50th special I do believe.

So when 11th, in the 50th special, sees the time window open (where he throws the fez in) he says ""This is where I come in..."" as he starts to remember it a little (having done it twice previously at this point.)

This is also where, to me, the entirety of nu-who up until this point wraps back up into S1E1: Rose. 

At the very end of the 50th, we see the War Doctor begin to regenerate into 9th. In S1E1: Rose, we see Christopher Eccleston comment on his ears.

Now, it could be said that since usually when the Doctor regenerates he needs many hours of recovery and sleep, that some time has passed since we see John Hurt being to regenerate at the end of the 50th Special and 9th in S1E1: Rose, and maybe he just hasn't looked in a mirror, but to me those events happen right after eachother. The pictures of Christopher Eccleston's doctor that the large gentlemen shows Rose in S1E1, I believe are pictures of 9th from his own future from a time when he was in the past.

So, in short, to me what we saw happen to Gallifrey in the 50th is exactly what happened every time around, without Rose as the Bad Wolf changing it.

To me, this also explains 10th's confusion during The End of Time (Season 4 Episodes 17/18) when the Time Lord's are coming back through their plan involving The Master. The Doctor exclaims how this is altogether impossible, they're time locked.

Without a better explanation of a ""Time Lock,"" they were only ""locked"" anywhere relative to the Doctor's timeline, between the 3 Doctor's choosing *not* to use the moment and the end of Matt Smith's tenure.

They merged two local - rival - teams into one and my interest began to fade. It was at the that time I started buying two czech football magazines with my pocket money and got more knowledge about european football.

Every summer there was this special edition with a guide to the Premier League season and I first noticed Villa. It was very vain from me, I simply liked the name, liked the colours and liked the fact that none of my friends knew anything about them, they were into Barca, Man Utd and Inter Milan.

The information about Villa had been scarce in the age without internet so I only knew what I read in that season guide and results in the monday paper. Besides Villa I also followed Shevchenko because I loved him in the champions league when he was still in Kiev with Rebrov.

Then I kind of forgot about football in my late high school years, it wasn't *cool* to like football and the lack of internet made it impossible to watch either Villa or Sheva play.

To say that Scotland is a monocultural society shows a complete lack of basic understanding of Scottish culture. I would challenge you to walk down any street in Glasgow and not see some influence of foreign culture standing firm. 

Trust me when I tell you that there is no one Scots accent, my Glaswegian accent sounds completely different to the town on the other side of the river, and going further afield to Oban or Aberdeen shows a similar difference in accents compatible to England's many varieties. I have never seen or heard of anyone being harassed beyond light ribbing because of their accent.

This is the first I have heard of our supposed ""purity"". What does that mean? Given half the chance we would be looting and burning any non-scot shop and kicking you all back to your own country? Scotland is one of the most ""live and let live"" cultures that I have ever seen, we do not have a very large problem over immigration such as can been seen in England due to the fact that immigrants come here and integrate with our culture. They take on the culture, and rub some off, changing it over time. 

This narrow minded view of the Scottish as a whole shows a lack of comprehension of fundamental parts of the Scottish way of life, and seems to suggest that the only information that you have ever read about Scotland has come from either the Mail or the Express.

But some quick googling to see whether 'work clothing' is anything turned up [this page](https://www.gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees/overview) which specifies that you can claim tax relief on certain things that are required for your job (and only for your job - if you use them privately as well then no dice)

Including the following on page 4:

&gt;Is Interactive Brokers the best one in the UK in terms of fees, access to different markets (to get access to stocks outside of the UK as well), ease of usage, etc.?

For comparing fees: http://monevator.com/compare-uk-cheapest-online-brokers/

Exactly which one works out cheapest depends on how often and how much you invest, and what you invest into. Wouldn't be able to tell you offhand which has the best access to different stocks; I guess put together a shortlist based on fees then check to see if they offer the access you want.

Actually liberty is the choice of whether to have a child or not. Not feeling you should have an abortion and not feeling that you shouldn't, but actually having a choice. That includes being able to have a child and still have an education, a career, financial security etc. 

A lot of women/couples have abortions because they don't think they can afford children/it doesn't fit into their life plans re:career education etc. By making access to childcare easier and cheaper, by legislating to reduce the impact that childbirth has on a woman's career and education and by supporting families and single mothers, then you can reduce the abortion rate and increase liberty.

This is what has happened in the Netherlands, the Netherlands is actually very interesting, because they have a low abortion rate, but still allow government funded abortions up to 24 weeks like the UK (and unlike most of the EU which is 12). Their low abortion rate is generally attributed to an excellent support structure (both financially and holistically) for mothers and excellent sex education (which the government can legislate to make mandatory).

But again I think the key massive point your missing is that actually feeling like your situation means you would be best to have an abortion, even though really you'd ideally not like to have one, is just as bad as not being able to have an abortion even though you would like one.  Neither of those options are examples of liberty.

That makes sense from what I've read of ANPR cameras, however, IIRC the lady I spoke to at my local station said that there is no record of my car having been caught speeding on the PNC. I should have recorded that call, in hindsight. Either way, with any luck I'll be getting the case notes for my case with the local police, so I'll see what they say there.

As the defendant, you are entitled to see the case against you. Make enquiries - you want to see the photo/video of the offence, the statement of the person sending the 'notice of intended prosecution', and any evidence relating to your 'failure to nominate'.

What appears to have happened is that you've received the NIP, phoned the police station, and assumed that was that. I would also be looking to see if you can't get whatever handling number was assigned to the phone call you made.

Now, I'm not a defence brief, so don't take this as legal advice. However, if I was looking to cast doubt on the prosecution case that the vehicle seen was the vehicle I own, I'd start with the photo. 

If it's a rear facing camera, what dealer stickers are in the rear window on the photo, compared with your car? Pop outside and look at your number plates. See the company name on the bottom? I bet that wouldn't match the cloned plate, if it has any at all.

Front facing camera? Same with the plate, also you should be looking at a shot of the driver, which should be pretty bombproof.

It could well be that the car's only partially a match, in which case you're laughing. It may not even be slightly identical! Could be a misread of the plate, which isn't unheard of.

I don't know if/when the evidence is likely to be served on you, but if you don't get it before the hearing, you need to let the court know on the day. Magistrates are relatively informal - you're pleading not guilty because it's a case of mistaken identity, and it's the prosecution who needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it's you who was speeding. Stick to your guns, I'd put money on the CPS dropping it on the day if there's any doubt at all.

Big difference between stopping strikes and requiring a decent percentage of affected members to vote in decisions that affect thousands or millions of people. You could try to stop putting words in people's mouths. I suppose I'd expect it from a supporter of the party that is basically bankrolled by unions (and big business/tax avoiders when it suits them) - it'd be like asking a Conservative supporter about their views on more regulations for business

We're talking things that directly affect members' jobs, pay and perks. If a union can't get people out to vote, then they are a pretty awful union.

&gt; That people strike for many good reasons? That we frequently find that far more people participate in strikes than vote for them? 

So? If people want to strike, they'll vote for it (if the laws change). No reason why intention shouldn't be recorded.

&gt; No other country in the world has such a piece of legislation.

Meaningless.

&gt; Regarding online balloting: It still wouldn't make this decision right. I merely raised it as a sensible alternative that would achieve what the Tories pretend they want to highlight the fact that they're lying about it.

How do we know that it would achieve better turnout?

&gt; I have no idea what multiple choices have to do with turnout, either.

You're less likely to vote if the result is going to be diluted with multiple options - but really it was just pointing out a difference to a general election since the oft-used ""argument"" is that governments can't get majorities of the vote or great turnouts (though typically higher turnouts than are proposed for unions)

&gt; And the Tories have upheld or extended many of the poor decisions Labour made on human rights and civil liberties. In any case, Labour's track record is irrelevant: I am criticising a proposal made by the Tories because it's a horrendous idea that would be horrendous whoever made it and regardless of my party political affiliations.

The advice given above and the reference to the CAB guide is therefore correct - sometimes people follow English advice when they live in Scotland and that's incorrect. I would chime in about enforcement - a very brief guide to the most common types of enforcement:

* bailiffs / High Court Enforcement Officers - if you manage to get a judgment against her, and it's over £600, **do not use county court bailiffs**. Instead use HCEOs, also called sheriffs. Instead of being civil servants who are paid no matter what, their companies' profitability depends on being good at getting the money in, and it shows. Two examples are [Sherforce](https://www.shergroup.net/enforcement/county-court-judgements.aspx) and [Marstons](http://www.marstongroup.co.uk/). They basically show up and start confiscating people's goods and car's and so forth. If your friend has none of these, eg she has very few possessions and lives with her parents, it might be fruitless.
* attachment of earnings - this is my favourite, and I have used it. You need to know who she works for. The court then orders her employer to deduct a small amount of money from her wages every month and they send it to you. It's slow but you know, tortoise and the hare and all that.
* charging order - only useful if she has owns a house. You only get your money back when she moves. If her mortgage company repossess or she goes into negative equity with them you get nothing. They are quite fiddly to apply for.
* third party debt order - this basically means that if she has a bank account you can freeze it and they'll send you the money. If she's borrowing money from you then it might be unlikely that she has a bank account with sufficient money in. Plus you'd need to know her bank details.
* order to attend for questioning. This is an order that she attend a county court and divulge all the above details re job, bank etc to an official, who writes to you and gives you the info. Sounds useful, but they have a bad reputation, as people say it's very easy to just ignore the order to attend, or to turn up and just spout a load of lies. I've never used it.
* bankruptcy. Deeply satisfying, but expensive to start and won't necessarily get you your money back. No-one likes the idea of being bankrupt because you're basically screwed for credit for a good long time, so a county court date for a bankruptcy hearing can often *persuade* people to pay up. It's quite technical, so make sure you've researched properly how to do it.

All of this only applies once you have your judgment.

So what does David Cameron do, even though the pledge of more powers is totally vague and has no concrete parts to it, the instant the referendum is over? He makes a speech about ""English votes for English laws"". 

Now no one in Scotland is against such a proposal but the timing for making such a speech was so bad it is again impossible to describe. It managed to alienate the unionists who somehow managed to resists the alienation of the  ""Better Together"" campaign.

null,false,for_shaaame,null,null,null,"&gt; I read that the only proof they needed to provide was that the car was speeding - it's up to me to prove that it wasn't me.

This is certainly not correct.  The offence is committed by a person who ""drives a motor vehicle on a road at a speed exceeding a limit imposed by or under any enactment to which this section applies"".  It is up to the Crown to prove that the person accused was driving.

I know it may seem like it sometimes, but the police and the courts aren't there to catch you out - everyone involved gets paid the same whether you get found guilty or not guilty, they're all just trying to get the *correct* verdict.  If you go along and present your case you'll find them most agreeable people.

&gt;there is no record of my car having been caught speeding on the PNC

I don't know what she said or what you understood by it, but PNC does not keep records of vehicles speeding.  Convictions for almost all offences, including speeding and other traffic offences, are held against person records rather than vehicle records.  Vehicle information is restricted to the registered keeper and insured drivers, and identifying marks for the vehicle.  The only offence record held against a vehicle is a warning given under S. 59 Police Reform Act for unlawful or antisocial use of a vehicle - not something you need to concern yourself with in this case.

&gt;Right, would you advise going to the Citizens Advice Bureau, a specialist solicitor, or both?

CAB are generally quite good, but nothing (including the advice you're reading from me, on Reddit) comes close to the advice of a good solicitor.  They're generally quite affordable as well, and you may even qualify for legal aid (I'm not sure if you can receive legal aid for speeding offences, but give it a go - just ask the solicitor).

&gt;As I will be pleading not guilty, but have the mitigating circumstances form already written (on Word on my computer, not on the Requisition), should I include that or not?

No.  The mitigation form is only for those who are pleading guilty by post so that they don't have to appear at court but the court can still pass a sentence which reflects all the circumstances of the offence.  Since you will be appearing at court, you can present your own mitigation in person - that is, if you are found guilty.",null,0,null,1431643993,null,0,false,0,cr9epte,null,t3_35zj7w,null,t1_cr9epte,null,t1_cr9e48k,null,null,null,1433068357,null,1,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

As it happens I entirely agree with you. Cameron cynically played England against Scotland in this campaign, and this is part of the reason the Conservatives did so well. Your explanation about the SNP gaining votes on the back of the Better Together campaign and Cameron's EVEL speech completely contradicts the consensus amongst pretty much every SNP supporter that I've listened to that Labour were responsible for their own demise in Scotland over tens of years, not the space of a few weeks, and that the rise of the SNP has nothing to do with nationalism (the above link, for example).

I'd say we'd be better off getting two players that could pull 10-15 goals each. The thing we need to bear in mind when it comes to the goalscoring this season and last, is the fact that it wasn't just strikers scoring goals. Our midfielders were more prolific last season too. If you watch us this season though, nobody seems to have space when we get into the final third. Having a pair of good strikers will draw defenders out and create that space, one of the (many) things Suarez did.

Reality is that the medical definition of what is fine or not re: abortion depends not on whether the foetus is a person but rather on the technology to allow it to survive outside the womb.

Which means using a ""scientific"" definition of whether it is right or wrong is incredibly problematic - you are defining a person by something that is extrinsic to that person. It also means that what is ok and what is morally wrong depends on what time you live in. In 1950 a 25 week old foetus isn't a person, but it is in 2015?

Reality is nobody knows at what point a foetus is a ""person"", therefore making abortion murder. Nobody can ever know. Some people might feel that at any point before birth is fine - would you disagree with abortion at 39 weeks or at what arbitrary point would you consider it murder?

Best you can say is that you don't think it is murder, but you can't say for sure. That is the *only* position backed up by ""evidence"".

I would have lost it either way, I didn't feel healthy and getting puffed out walking up 3 flights of stairs didn't feel right. All I'm saying is I've never met a fat person who *likes* being fat, they know what they have to do, they're bombarded with the information - eat right, exercise, don't go above your calorie limit. They didn't wake up fat, it took years of hard eating to get that way. They wake up and look at themselves in the mirror every morning and never feel comfortable in their bodies. When you've sat on your hole for years shovelling in burgers and pepsi the idea of pain isn't very nice, and working out the first few times is painful. I see food as an addiction, if you've spent years guzzling down sugar you're going to get withdrawals, little difference to other addictions. Breaking that habit is the hardest part. I was lucky in that I actually like healthier food just as much as I like fast food, so I ate more veg and lean meat and less burgers and KFC. I fucking *love* fast food but I just love food in general and follow a kind of mediterranean diet because thats what works for me. 

I wouldn't take /r/fatpeoplehate seriously though, funny as it is its mainly memes and people on t'internet talking pish. fatpeoplehate isn't going to help people, its ex-fatties and never-fatties acting like cunts on the internet. 

Edit: Because of my past being fairly fit I probably lost it quicker than most people would, I already knew what to do. If I spent my life as a tub of lard it would be hectic. I feel sorry for people who can't/won't do it, its not so much weakness as it is lack of experience, a lack of understanding of how the body works. I spent years learning about that stuff and spent most of my life boxing, cycling and doing a lot of martial arts. Most fat people havent. Thats not to say they are in denial. They aren't. They know they are fat, most don't like it and starting off losing it is daunting.

null,false,SiriusCyberneticCorp,null,null,null,"I didn't choose to study politics formally until sixth form, but by then I had already learnt more than enough about the issues to qualify me to vote on them. That was down to have parents who could engage with my questions, a healthy appetite for knowledge and the constant presence of newspapers, political magazines and the internet in my life. Eight years later I feel there is little I am not clued up on when it comes to the salient issues in the UK. I can provide a reasoned argument in favour of both sides of almost any policy viewpoint. Playing Devil's advocate with other informed people is always fun. I will almost always learn new things and update my views every time I enter into a political discussion.

I was by no means alone at school, and it has never been easier to get clued up about politics. I think the obsession with social media has distorted perspectives - there are plenty of better sources of information and I believe they are well-tapped by the majority of voters. The stupid tend to be the loudest, but I am optimistic about our democracy. Look at the youth in Scotland for an example. A 20 year old SNP candidate unseated a member of the Shadow Cabinet, she's the youngest MP of modern times and she's no idiot either. That is pretty fucking brilliant, I think.

Those who want to learn, will learn. The best way to educate our youth about politics is to place them with other young people who take an interest. They will engage with each other and immediately learn that adopting views and defending them is a genuinely important part of life. Leave the apathetic to catch up in their own time - you're not going to engage with everybody no matter how compulsory you make it.",null,0,null,1431646527,null,0,1431647397,0,cr9g3fm,null,t3_35xecm,null,t1_cr9g3fm,null,t3_35xecm,null,null,null,1433069007,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,nssmuckers,num5-away,,null,"Well I don't agree at all that we haven't improved. We certainly haven't overachieved but we haven't been terrible until the last month or so. Maybe that's a discussion for another thread, but I do think we've improved in several ways that haven't yet translated into better results but still bode well for the future. 

There are a few reasons I am hoping we show a bit of patience with Pochettino. 

A) He seems like the most realistic manager to succeed with limited funds and the sustainable structure we're striving for at the club. He has a head of player recruitment that he trusts and whether or not you like him it's undeniable that he has a history of including and improving young players and academy players. These traits are going to be increasingly important for most clubs going forward. 

B) Lack of viable alternatives. We aren't getting Klopp or Ancelotti, probably not Benitez, etc etc. He isn't particularly experienced but the alternatives aren't either. I suspect our fans wouldn't be particularly receptive to hiring someone like Allerdyce or Moyes or Pulis. I know I wouldn't. In the absence of a clear improvement, why on earth do what we've been doing for the last decade and pull the plug yet again and rebuild yet again? It's pretty fucking obvious that it's not the managers that are holding us back from becoming a top four team. I don't even know why that's still the expectation for our increasingly idiotic fans. 

C) The spirit at the club is as good as it's been in years and until the last month or so the spirit of the fans was as good as it's been in years. Results haven't been good lately, but the nice thing with this squad is that we're back to at least showing some heart and effort on the pitch. The manager gets players to fight for him wherever he's been...he is well-liked but also operates in a very egalitarian manner. He doesn't have his favorites; he selects the team he feels he can trust the most. Posters here may not always agree with that team, but at least he isn't basing his selection on personal shit. 

D) He has a clear philosophy on the way the game is to be played and the evidence of his influence is pretty easy to see. I think unfortunately tactics are his biggest weakness as a manager but at the same time overall we've played with more purpose this season. I know the last month or so has been garbage but looking back at the season as a whole I sincerely do think we've improved our teamwork and incisiveness. Our link between midfield and attack is much stronger and we generally move the ball quicker (again, overall...not recently). 

I just don't understand how at this point we can have any fan who doesn't think the manager at least deserves a chance of actually getting players he likes and seeing his ideas implemented. Three seasons is not that long yet we already have a lot of people who have turned on Pochettino. What good is blowing up the team going to do? We aren't going to sign fucking Guardiola, we aren't going to spend more money, so we're going to sign some guy who will get us to finish 6th or 5th again. It just doesn't matter. It will achieve nothing. 

Pochettino needs to be more flexible tactically...that is his cardinal sin really. His ideas are unsustainable for this squad over a 50+ game season. We've played so many games and haven't rotated enough. He needs to either have more faith in certain players so we can rotate more or he needs to understand that eventually people are going to run out of steam if they are running around like crazy for 50 games. 

I think the tactical stuff like that can improve, and he's already acknowledged that we need to find a better balance for our defense. Stuff like philosophy and ability to motivate and recruitment and use of young players? That will never change for a manager. Either he believes in it or he doesn't.

Sitting with both of them as the final whistle went and seeing the pure elation on both thier faces as my grandad held me tight with a tear in his eye. The league cup also gave me one of my precious final memories of my dad as we spent the weekend together in london during the man utd cup final in 2010 when we were beaten. It had come after I was diagnosed with cancer a month before.Shortly after that game on the train home my dad seeing that I was absolutely gutted turned round and said we will just come back for the next one and win that one when I got better.

I agree 100%.

And now look at this shithead, who has been preaching like this for TEN YEARS and we've never been able to make a single charge stick. He was a lawyer, so he words his statements carefully to avoid directly condoning terrorism.

Here's some quotes just from this month so far:

&gt;If the Shari'ah were implemented in Britain men &amp; women would cover their nakedness in public according to Islam &amp; there'd be no free-mixing

Lovely. No free mixing of sexes. That's a nice environment we'd all want to live in!

Or how about this, after the shooting at the ""draw Mohammed"" competition in the US last week:

&gt;we must learn the lessons from Rushdie, Hirsi Ali, Theo Van Gogh &amp; Chalie Hebdo not to insult the Messenger Muhammad (saw)!

Slightly veiled condoning of murder there. Clearly anyone drawing a cartoon of an imaginary bloke needs to be killed!

&gt;There is no 'Muslim' in the British or American army, anyone who even gives a glass of water to the enemies fighting Muslims is an apostate!

Great!

&gt;No Muslim can stay Muslim if he promotes interfaith or the equality between all religions rather Islam is the truth &amp; superior to all others

And there we have it. Not exactly a super ""tolerant"" supporter of equality is he? He's also said that he encourages Muslims to have 10 children per family so that the UK can become a Sharia Muslim nation as quickly as possible.

So personally, I have pretty much zero desire to preserve the right to ""freedom of speech"" of morons like this guy.

Cricket is a game where players have much more individual control on their own performance. They don't have to rely on their teammates as much - they don't need through balls or defensive cover to perform, it's just them facing or bowling an individual ball. In addition the captain, not the coach, makes the majority of tactical decisions. 

You would think this is an argument in favour of KP, but it isn't.

Firstly, this is a zero-sum game. You play KP, players will either be less motivated or refuse to play with him. KP has been a toxic influence wherever he's played - Leicestershire, Hampshire, his Twenty20 franchises. Pietersen contributed consistently but everyone around him suffered a performance drop. He was directly responsible for Swann's retirement midway through the last Ashes when you'd expect any professional to at least see out the series. 

Secondly, as I said before, the captain is the tactical and motivational nucleus of the side. Cricket captaincy is far more difficult than slapping on an armband and arguing with referees. When a team looks lost on the field, the first one to be blamed is the captain. 

KP's relationship with Cook, his captain, is unsalvageable. An analogy to football would be if a star player fell out with the manager. Who would walk if Kane was caught banging Poch's wife? Either way, we lose a great asset if we're forced into a 'me or him' situation. Cook, for all his form troubles at the moment, is one of the best English batsmen in Test history. 

Thirdly, managers and captains lose the dressing room all the time. It takes a special kind of douchebag to be part of the rank and file, be good enough to protect the livelihoods of your teammates, and them deciding *it's better to risk that livelihood* than play with you.

Morale is the most precious commodity in sport, from Sunday League to a World Cup Final. It must be protected at all costs, including the opportunity cost of a star player's contribution. Morale is the only way a team performs better than simply the sum of its parts.

That's what I think, anyway.",null,0,null,1431651811,null,0,1431652141,0,cr9iwoa,null,t3_35oug5,null,t1_cr9iwoa,null,t3_35oug5,null,null,null,1433070332,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

Some of the stuff he questions being taught - like mental maths - we would have the least numerate society in the western world and certainly be poorer for it if we made stuff like that optional.

I mean you see it exactly within this video, he advocates learning ""important"" stuff like paying taxes, why bother learning some abstract stuff that you don't see the relevance of when there's an easier course running the same time that has some relevance to your life?

I would argue that we're not stable at all at the moment.  We have little identity in terms of playstyle, players playing out of position very frequently, performances have been massively inconsistent, poor transfer targets, and lately not much in the way of on pitch mettle.  I think we need stability and changing the manager might provide that, not make us even less stable.

In short, if the main reason to keep Rodgers is to provide some misguided notion of stability, that's a pretty shit reason.

We have a transfer committee that factors statistical analysis into signings. Lots of clubs do now. It's not particularly innovative to do that. The difference is in executing it well, and Southampton are certainly the league leaders in that regard. Yeah there's room for improvement there.

Continued commercial income growth and the stadium expansion - which i don't think is being paid for by FSGs own money - will also help.

He can play at 60% and he's still easily one of our best players. 

At any rate, I think there's a difference between having favorites and not trusting certain members of the squad. He doesn't actively damage the team by persisting with players because of personal vendettas against others. 

You may not agree with his selection, but the squad harmony speaks for itself...it is not ridden with different cliques as it was in years past, and even giving chances to players like Bentaleb and Mason and Kane when there are more expensive and experienced alternatives speaks volumes. The team is more motivated than it's been since probably 2011 and the players have spoken numerous times about feeling like any player can get into the side if they put the work in during training. Maybe the players who can't break into the team are just not as good as people here think they are.

While there is something to be said about 'fairly representing the people', more often than not, 'the people' don't even know what they want and don't understand what's best for the country overall.

Have you been to Tigre? It's where Francisco lives and he showed me around last year. I loved it there! Although he wasn't all that keen on the amount of Domingueros :) 

Hoping to take my Dad to SK next year (we were originally meant to go for the 2002 WC). Just need to brush up on my 한국. I recently read a book called 'The birth of Korean cool' which was a fantastic eye-opener in how pro-active the Koreans are in exporting, not just their technology, but their culture. Would hate to see how Australia would be without our natural resources, but SK have managed it superbly (viewing from afar). 
Hope you don't mind me getting in touch closer to the trip :)

Any group that intends to undermine democracy and to remove the democratic process has no place in our country. That includes Islamist groups that want to impose a global caliphate on the world.  This includes the likes of hizb-ut-tahrir and the remnants of al-muhajiroun - choudharys mob, groups that are banned across the Muslim world. 

You can argue that we should be able to debate these groups out of existence but have you ever tried debating with these zealots? They only thing they respect is the religious texts and they refuse to respect man made law. HUT  encourage Muslims to not participate in elections and to not respect our institutions. 

These groups are the stepping stones to violent jihad, so not doing anything has   serious implications for the lives of innocent people. I don't support Muslims or any other British person wasting theirs or others lives in the name of an idealistic political solution and these groups have been using the UK as a recruiting ground for decades, its time to shut the ideologues down. Any form of political solution that removes our right to democratic choice has absolutely no place in our society.

This isn't going to be about Joe blog and his opinion but those who actively reject our society and encourage others to do so. This is about those Islamist groups that refuse to accept they are living in Britain and not 7th century Mecca or 1933 Germany.

Inter are absolutely fucking skint. There's rumours that £12-14million (which Chelsea are ready to bid for him to sit on the bench behind Costa) is enough to turn their heads as far as Icardi is concerned. 

Hoffenheim are also strapped for cash, less so than usual because of the new Bundesliga TV deal. Our main rivals for Firmino were United, but I highly doubt they're interested now they have Depay. 

Camacho is part of a Malaga team that have struggled, Kramer got shipped out from Bayer to Gladbach so he's obviously not in the immediate plans. Neither are *that* unrealistic.

Van Der Wiel isn't PSG's first choice. We need a right back, they didn't pay much for him to begin with (€6million if I recall correctly) seems a no brainier to test their resolve.

If we were told that your NHS taxes were going to be separated out from the rest of your taxes, few people would have a problem with it.

We could imagine national insurance increased a bit, with a commensurate decrease in income tax - this would allow the whole national insurance contribution component to be ringfenced so it goes directly to the NHS, in order to ""protect"" it.

Anyone who said this was the death of the NHS would be widely ridiculed, except it would mean that everyone would get used the the idea that one component of their tax was for healthcare and another component would be for everything else. 

Soon most people would consider it perfectly reasonable that those who buy private health insurance shouldn't have to pay the national insurance tax component, and at that point the NHS is fucked.

From then the NHS would erode very rapidly indeed, and the arguments would be ""if you don't like these cuts, you don't have to suffer them - just buy a cheap plan from BUPA instead"" and ""the NHS is supposed to be the minimum healthcare service, for people who can't afford anything better"".

null,false,MrFuckingRandom,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,null,"If you don't mind me asking, what do you mean by the ignorant hysteria over the Human Rights Act? 

Whilst I'm not hysterical about the proposed repeal, I am concerned about the rationale for the repeal, that we are forced to comply with the ECHR and in particular, article 8. 

Firstly, we aren't forced. The government can do what they like- even legislate to override section 6 in respect of terrorism offences if they wanted to - as 'Hirst v UK' proved (prisoner voting). Only courts remain compelled to abide by the Convention rights so long as domestic legislation does not tell them not to. Even when references are made to te ECtHR for a ruling, it is emphasised that the UK has a margin of appreciation and may take a different course of action that meets the needs of it's citizens so long as that action is necessary in a democratic society for one of a few acceptable reasons.

Secondly, the convention contains far more rights than article 8. To suggest reform because of one inconvenient right (article 8, in the eyes of the Conservatives) is madness. It's cuts across not only the criminal sphere but many aspects of civil law. Article 8 itself is actually a good thing! It prevents victims of domestic violence being kicked out of their homes by their a users when they inform the police. It was the basis for children being deemed to have their own medical confidentiality independent of their parents in 'R(axon) v Secretary of State for health!. Without the HRA, the carpet under the feet of the ruling is ripped away, and may be open to challenge.

So if, as I said, repealing the HRA on the basis of the article 8 right alone is madness, then I doubt that's the sole reason why they are doing it. I want to see what else will be cut. Will it be the right to protest in order to 'prevent riots' but which makes marches, demonstrations and petitions also unlawful? We don't know. That's why it's so unsettling.

In a more immediate way, union with the EU gives us bigger negotiating might as we can sell ourselves collectively, and ideally the investment in the EU (even if we do not get our share back right away) would mean a more prosperous EU and market for us to be involved in. 

Further, the uniform nature of the EU laws gives (to me) a reassuring base line that to a large extent acts in a similar fashion as the US constitution.

I don't know that that's really true.

He had a similar love-hate relationship with Mussolini.  These were the guys fighting socialism and communism after all...

On Hitler: ""One may dislike Hitler’s system and yet admire his patriotic achievement. If our country were defeated, I hope we should find a champion as indomitable to restore our courage and lead us back to our place among the nations.""

Later on, on Hitler: ""I have always said that if Great Britain were defeated in war I hoped we should find a Hitler to lead us back to our right­ful posi­tion among the nations. I am sorry, how­ever, that he has not been mel­lowed by the great suc­cess that has attended him.

On Mussolini: ""I could not help being charmed, like so many other people have been, by his gentle and simple bearing and by his calm, detached poise in spite of so many burdens. If I had been an Italian, I am sure that I should have been whole-heartedly with you from start to finish in your triumphant struggle against the bestial appetites and passions of Leninism.

Are you? Can you provide some kind of citation for this?

If more people participate in a strike than voted for it, that shows that they support the strike. If strikes actually only have minority support, they will fail. The alleged problem -- that strikes go ahead that workers don't 'really' want -- simply cannot exist.

null,false,Taure,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,null,"You should be clear what you mean by ""privatisation"".

You could have what we might call ""soft privatisation"", in which the NHS continues to be funded by taxes and free at the point of care, but the way the taxes are spent are to pay private health companies to provide services, rather than a government agency. Soft privatisation has been the reality for many years now, but its extent is increasing under Tory restructuring.

Then you have ""true privatisation"" in which the government ceases to pay for healthcare via public funds, though it continues to regulate the sector. Healthcare providers are private, and people pay either out of pocket or from an insurance policy. The government may provide their own insurance, and this insurance may well be compulsory for all citizens, unless you opt to enrol in a private insurer (generally paying more for better care).

True privatisation is not really on the cards in the UK, for any major political party.

The dangers of privatisation (of both kinds) are generally exaggerated by the bogeyman of the US healthcare system (44 million uninsured prior to Obamacare), but notably many of Europe's healthcare systems are private, ranked higher than the UK's in terms of quality, and still manage to cover the entire population. This is because their insurance sectors are regulated by the government much more strictly than in the US, and through the provision of public health insurance (which the US does not do, unless you fit into medicare or medicaid). Other notable private systems with public insurance which work well are South Korea and Chile.

(See [this](http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2003/02/Int_Health_Comp.pdf) report (PDF) for how the the UK's system is lower-ranked to many others: we have fewer doctors, nurses, beds, MRIs, lower cancer survival rates).

There are two main dangers people warn against with respect to private systems:

1. The danger of people going without health care. 

2. The inefficiencies of profit.

The first isn't really a serious criticism. As can be seen from the European health sector, the risk can be easily solved via public insurance systems.

This second problem can be explained with an example. Imagine you have £1000 to spend on healthcare services. In a public system 100% of that £1000 is spent on the provision of the service. In the private system where you have profit-making providers, the portion of the money that is taken as profit does not go towards the provision of services. So if profit is 10%, only £900 is being spent on provision of services.

It follows that in a private system, you'll get less for the same amount of money (whether you're paying private companies via taxation or insurance). As such, you'll have to spend more to get the same level of care, which is the definition of inefficiency.

This worry is somewhat borne out by international figures of [health care spending as a percentage of GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_%28PPP%29_per_capita). US spending is off the chart (17.7%); UK spending is very low (9.4%), even in comparison to other European countries (France and Germany both at 11%). The UK system seems quite efficient as things stand.

However, this argument comes subject to a big caveat: it assumes that the private sector and public sector can provide the same health care outcomes for the same money. If the private sector were more efficient than the public sector, such that it could achieve the same health care outcome with that £900 as the public sector does with £1000 then the private system is superior, because you're getting the same level of healthcare while also growing the economy.

Whether or not the private sector can achieve this efficiency gain is the big debate, and it's largely a matter of fact, not principle. In South Korea the private sector is incredibly efficient; intense competition between providers keeps prices and waiting times low. Health spending is at 7.4% of GDP to the UK’s 9.4%, but [cancer survival rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_health_care_outcome) are much higher, as are [number of hospital beds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds) . However, it's by no means certain that the UK could replicate this competitive environment, especially if doctors and nurses formed organised labour (ungenerously, cartels) to keep their wages high.

For this reason, when government contracts out healthcare to a private company, it pays a set price for the achievement of strictly defined healthcare outcomes. If the provider fails to provide those outcomes, they will be in breach of contract, pay damages and likely not have their contract renewed.

Nowhere did I say that having a Tory government means you have to agree with everything they do. But it does mean you have to up to a point respect their demographic mandate to govern on everything in their manifesto and in the general wheelhouse of their known positions on the issues.

The only strong argument against EU membership is in fact just an argument against population growth in general. But I believe strongly that healthy population growth is good for Britain. If immigration continues at its current rate, it will take Britain 100 years to reach the same population density as Japan, something I consider desirable (and at the very least, not objectionable).

The EU brings significant economic benefits.

I value multiculturalism and love being surrounded by people from different national backgrounds, speaking different languages.

I believe that the UK needs a vision for its role in the world and the niche it will enjoy. I believe membership of the EU is a good vehicle for that, which will allow us to simultaneously act as a great regional power in our own right, and a global power as part of the EU. I believe Britain should abandon delusional ambitions of unilateral global power: with the rise of China, India and Brazil, the UK will become irrelevant and lose its negotiating voice if we do not act as part of a larger bloc. We should aim be to the EU as Hong Kong is to China: a hub for business and trade, benefiting from common security and diplomatic clout. 

I support greater political union in the long term, but I think it must be preceded by cultural union. The EU should focus on culture for the next few decades. The current level of political union is more than enough for the level of cultural union we current have. But I have no objection in principle to being ruled by people of various European nationalities (including British). Germans and French people have equal competence and integrity to Britons.

What are you talking about? More than 50% of those voting have to support strike action for it to be valid. You can't have a legal strike if only 44.7% of those voting support it. So the same results as the referendum wouldn't be sufficient for a strike.

What the Conservatives want to do is bring in two extra limitations:

1. A majority of voters backing strike action also need to represent at least 40% of *eligible* voters. For example, if 65% of voters support the strike with a turnout of 60%, then those voting for a strike represent 39% of eligible voters. Therefore under their plans the strike would not be valid. 

2. They also want a minimum 50% turnout. So you could have a result where 100% of voters support the strike, with a turnout of 45%. They therefore represent 45% of eligible voters, but because turnout wasn't 50% the strike is still invalid. 

The only way this is comparable to the Scottish referendum is if those voting 'Yes' had to achieve more than 50% of the vote, have 50% turn out, and represent 40% of eligible voters. Of course no such limitations were applied.

null,false,IxionS3,null,null,null,"&gt; Where do I stand with regards to tax, student loan repayments (pre-2012) and NI on this amount? (I am above the student loan repayment threshold in my PAYE job already.)

The whole amount (less any allowable expenses) will be liable to tax at basic rate (assuming it doesn't take your combined income over the higher rate threshold).  NI on self-employed income is calculated separately from employed income, and £2.5k is too low for you to have to pay any.  You used to have to claim a specific exemption but starting this tax year it'll all be handled automatically under SA.  AIUI student loan repayments will also be calculated on your profits at the normal rate, 9%.

&gt; Do I need to be registered as a sole trader, or can I do this work and declare it under ""other income"" on a self-assessment tax return as some websites are suggesting for casual work?

As you've found, and /u/DEADB33F's link shows, there's a grey area around when a business becomes ""serious"" enough to require you to register as a sole trader.  For such a relatively small sum it's unlikely anyone will get too bothered; on the other hand registering is easy and has no real downside.

&gt; When would my self-assessment tax return be due if I did the work within the next few months?

Tax returns are due at the end of the January following the tax year to which they refer. Work done in the next few months would fall in the 15/16 tax year.  15/16 tax returns will be due by 31/1/17.

&gt; Once I start doing self-assessment tax returns, do I have to do one every year or can I stop doing them once I no longer have extra income? Do I have to notify anyone?

Once you're registered for SA HMRC will expect you to complete one every year until you tell them you don't need to.  IME if you let them know that you have nothing you need to declare then they're quite happy to take you off SA.",null,0,null,1431679619,null,0,false,0,cr9tzq2,null,t3_35z29p,null,t1_cr9tzq2,null,t3_35z29p,null,null,null,1433075697,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

Your visa application will be considered but you would only be accepted if the home office officials who were considering your application were absolutely convinced there was no risk you would be overstaying.  Unless you have a lot to lose by not coming back (i.e. abandoning family, an occupation, and the majority of your money) and you have the resources to come (i.e. a healthy bank account with enough to cover your flights, hotels etc) you will be rejected and forfeit your visa fees which are typically not cheap.  People get their tourist visas rejected even when they have family here, from countries that are third-world but not war torn.

Here's the important bit:

(3) saying it is temporary growth is just an ill informed opinion - ALL of the ONS projections see population growth, and the one they consider to be their best estimate shows continued growth at a similar rate as now to beyond 2037. clearly some major changes to immigration policy will have to take place to change this projection.

They're not trying to scrap it, they're trying to replace it. This started with Labour back in 2007, who wanted to review and extend the HRA. The Tories want to replace it with a Bill of Rights.

The problem they are both trying to address (or at least using as the justification for the changes they propose) is things like the [2006 Afghan hijackers controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Afghan_hijackers_case), where several plane hijackers were allowed to remain in the UK, because of the HRA. The HRA also doesn't protect rights we *should* have protected, like the rights to a trial by jury or free speech.

There's no suggestion we would opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Depending on the new Bill of Rights, that might mean that appeals have to happen in Strasbourg rather than here, which may make appeals under the ECHR more expensive. But the protections are the same.

The proposed replacement Bill of Rights hasn't been published yet, AFAIK. We have no idea what's in it. It might be awesome, it might be worse then the HRA.

null,false,lichtie,null,null,null,"If we're intent on keeping the 42 team system, I'd start with;

* 16 team top division - 30 game league season.
* 10 team middle division - 3 up 3 down
* 16 team bottom division - 2 up plus playoff spot. 3 down. (1 to each HL/LL and one to a playoff between the 2nd place sides of the respective leagues.

a 30 game season would allow a more competitive league where the clear advantage of vast resources is mitigated. The 4 meetings per season is also a tired format. Aberdeen put up a decent fight this year but as the season has wore on, Celtic stretched ahead thanks in part to their depth.

The middle division would basically be the bridge between part-time and full-time football. Because the 10 team system isn't ideal, I'd have it arranged so that only 4 of the teams remain in the division in successive seasons. At this level, I think most fans are quite happy to explore new grounds and given that this is where the kind of natural PT/FT split would be (currently it is usually around the bottom 3 of the Championship - position 20) This would tend to mean that there is unlikely to be a safe mid-table position in the league. 

Bottom league would operate like the top one, a straight 30 team league. Nearly all the teams here would be part-time and a 30 game season should comfortably manage to operate on weekends only.

In order to make up the shortfall of games in the top division, I'd introduce a group system into the League cup, with the European qualifiers getting a bye to the knockout stages.


In time, the target would be to try and get a competitive season in the league rather than the same 2 clubs running 20-30 points clear every season. If Aberdeen, the Edinburgh and Dundee clubs could go into a season genuinely believing they had a chance, they'd sell more tickets, get a better atmosphere and the extra gate money would see a better quality product. This is when we can start making demands in terms of TV deals and sponsorship.

For too long our governing body has been too focussed on trying to generate crowds/sponsorship/TV money to help fix our game. The fact is, we need to fix our game first and the crowds and sponsors will come back.

He has said he wants to build closer links with the commonwealth and BRICS countries in particular as they're emerging markets.  But the EU stifles the sorts of terms we can get doing this and we'd be better off on our own.  Last night he pointed out that Iceland, a country with less than half a million people can do it's own deals with China so why can't we?  He's made good points about the negative influence the EU has had upon the third world and unethical things that happen as a result, and puts the case that a Britain on it's own could avoid doing these things.

He argues that the freedom of movement has damaged the British economy by depressing wages and placing strains upon services.  

Another argument he makes is that the EU is marching towards tighter and firmer union, ending in a USE with a Euro army and president and that Britains national sovreignity is under threat.  It will be less democratic as we'd have less say over our own affairs.  

Those are the arguments he has made time and time again.  He might even be wrong or right.  It's something we should actually talk about but you know it's easier to paint UKIP as 'Nigel hates foreigners, he's evil' and not discuss any of that.

We could challenge him and defend the EU by talking about the merging of standards and regulations that ease and speed up trade and services and things like that, or the number of Brits who've found work abroad in Europe.  The relative period of peace and stability we've had (historically amazing if you think about it) and how difficult it would be now to even fathom a war between EU states.  Maybe we could ask ourselves is a federal Europe that he fears even such a nightmare scenario... perhaps some of you out there think it's a good thing.  I dunno.

And this is a matter of framing the question. Women seem to think that their rights encompass the globe, and that its only men who should have their rights curtailed. Hell men don't even get the right to bodily integrity in infancy, but women should WITHOUT QUESTION have the right to terminate another life because its inconvenient? Really?

For the record, as I've already said I'm pro-choice, but you are framing the question in a way that you can more easily defend. A pro-lifer would frame the question as ""The ability to chose to murder a living, feeling entity"". Not my position, but i think its highly ignorant to frame the debate on something THIS controversial, where both sides have valid points, in a way that completely ignores the other sides views. 

Personally, i think the current status of abortion is just fine, in light of the current state of medical science its as good as we are going to get, but i think issues like this the debate is never going to go away, and when considered in light of medical advances and changes in scientific assumptions on which decisions and rules are based, it merits periodic reevaluation. 

&gt;This is mixing up what should be the case and what is the case, two rather different issues.

Well it isn't really mixing it up, is it? Its saying that what i am describing IS the case, and what you are describing is what you feel OUGHT to be the case. Now, as i said, if you can conceive of a better system, and get it implemented, more power to you, but right now we operate within the confines of a FPTP democracy based on party politics. 

&gt;This is what I reject. I don't think people who voted Tory agree with everything on their manifesto. If that is the case, then they don't have an automatic mandate for everything. Mandate is rightly determined on an issue-by-issue basis.

They have a mandate to make the case before parliament. Because if they did not, the people who voted for them in line with their manifesto promises would be deceived, and that would be the far greater usurpation of democratic principle. If they fail to get it passed, then so be it. If the proposal is so hated, they will likely struggle to hold together the votes even with a majority. 

Mandate is NOT determined by an issue by issue basis. Because mandate simply describes their right and expectations upon them to work towards a particular stated goal. If you promised X, Y and Z, and people voted for you because they want X and Z, but some aren't crazy about Y, that doesn't remove your mandate for Y. It means that you are going to have a harder time getting it passed. If you get it passed, you kept your promises, if the dissenters shoot down the bill, then it was the will of parliament and of the democratically elected representatives of the people, and that's also democracy.

Just because you have a mandate does not necessarily mean that it will get past the commons, that's what checks and balances are for. Your position appears to be that we should vote for X, because we like their haircut and then start screaming blue murder whenever they open their mouths because there is always going to be SOMEONE who finds their position reprehensible on any issue with any bite. It doesn't work that way, and it never will. Because it would be chaos.

In June 2013 two more arrests were made, with one of those arrested being a serving police officer. The officer, one of the four Diplomatic Protection officers already undergoing disciplinary investigation, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office and the civilian on suspicion of assisting an offender

I'm anything but. I break several laws a day, i do things that you would find morally reprehensible, mind you that could easily encompass anything with people like you. Very few people in fact follow all laws every day. Id wager you've broken several already and its only 10:30

I said i treat people with respect, and day to day, generally speaking, i do. And that's why the police never give me any trouble.

And of course the inevitable accusations will start to roll in that its because I'm a white male and privilege and all of that, yeah, sure i get stopped and searched less than BMEs, and i probably do have an easier time getting the police onside, but my brother, shot from the same barrel, cant look at a copper without getting some sort of charge. Because he doesn't know how to compose himself in polite conversation. He's like the rest of you. 

I didn't actually ""Talk"" him into anything by the way, i genuinely did have a faulty speedometer, now repaired, but that's really besides the point. Speeding is strict liability, he could have done me whether i knew i was speeding or not, but he chose not to because i spoke to him like a fucking human being and wasn't just a knobhead indignant about being pulled over. It wasn't corrupt, it was a public interest matter. He didn't feel, as is his discretion that it was in the public interest to prosecute someone in those circumstances. But he could have. And the point i am countering is the constant assumption that the police are ""Out to get us"". They aren't. 

As for someone swerving into my lane, absolutely you cant ever know that, I've had it happen, and had the bruises and the concussions to show for it. But two things:

1: If you take that logic you would never get behind the wheel of any vehicle. 
2: As I've already said, i was riding a motorcycle. If someone swerved into my lane and i couldn't stop due to ""Excess"" speed it is MY life I'm risking, not theirs. I had no pillion passenger, if i crashed into them they would barely fucking notice. So i really fail to see how (from a safety point of view) its anyone's business but mine.

Not my position, but i think its highly ignorant to frame the debate on something THIS controversial, where both sides have valid points, in a way that completely ignores the other sides views.

The two ""frames"" are not exclusive. ""Bodily self-determination"" and ""The ability to chose to murder a living, feeling entity"" do not contradict. The main argument for abortion is that people have the right to determine what happens with their body, even if it leads to the death of another. Whether or not the foetus is alive is morally irrelevant, because we hold bodily self-determination as more important than the right to life. If we did not, then we would permit forced kidney donations to save lives.

Worst British TV show I've ever seen: The Wright Way.

It aired on the BBC in 2013 and it was written by Ben Elton - he of Blackadder and the Young Ones fame. He came back to the BBC with a really, really bad TV show. It was an old-fashioned sitcom that was plucked out of the 70s or 80s, and was expected to work today. The first joke was about how long women spend in the bathroom. Yeah.

The storyline was about a health and safety worker in an office environment. Throughout the entirety of the first episode - the only episode that I saw - there was only one mildly amusing joke in the whole episode. Everything else was really bad, and what was even worse was that there a live laugh track. It was confusing - why were the audience laughing when I wasn't?

If you watched more episodes, apparently it got even worse. A whole speech about ~~a dishwasher~~ chest waxing was used in every episode, there was a joke about plans that would have rude words as their initials that appeared in every episode; running jokes are fine as long as they are funny. One character's catchphrase was 'That is such a Youtube moment'. The whole premise of 'man who rages at world that has moved on' has been done to death, and nothing new was brought to the table.

It's the worst TV programme I have ever seen. One day, I might watch every episode just to see how bad it truly is, but the BBC planned to release a DVD, but never did.

Media links follow to get a sense of just how bad it is:

Here's a clip from episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP0_eISFErA.

Here is someone's edited clip reel of episode 1 to get a taste of what it's like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFXgrmVRgGU.

2. Migrant workers often live in shared houses. I've seen 6 people or more in a 3-bed. I used to help rent houses in Oxford, so I know of what I speak. This is a different kind of housing than what families want - locations are different for a start - don't need to be near a school, often right on main roads, etc. I'm not saying there's no increase in demand pressure but it isn't as direct as you make out.

3. I have seen those and I remember the headlines when they came out. I have a problem with them in that I think the most likely outcome is that there'll be a continued low fertility and probably a drop in migration, so we could actually see quite a flat population trend.

I'll reiterate - and I don't think this is controversial - most of the migration we've seen in the last decade has been EU migration due to the accession of Poland and others. I'm all for this because it helps balance the economies of the 2 countries, it provides us with cheap labour and keeps inflation down. The idea is that in 20 years time, Poland's economy will have improved so much that there'll be very little net migration from there.

null,false,Shaft-of-Patriarchy,null,null,null,"&gt;The two ""frames"" are not exclusive. ""Bodily self-determination"" and ""The ability to chose to murder a living, feeling entity"" do not contradict. The main argument for abortion is that people have the right to determine what happens with their body, even if it leads to the death of another. Whether or not the foetus is alive is morally irrelevant, because we hold bodily self-determination as more important than the right to life. If we did not, then we would permit forced kidney donations to save lives.

I fail to see how in this particular case they arent contradictory. Pro-life thought would remove a womans ability to chose to terminate because her bodily autonomy is considered less important than the right of the foetus to life. 

Pro-choice thought would remove a foetuses unqualified right to life because the mothers bodily autonomy is considered more important. 

Those are pretty fundamentally contradictory viewpoints. 

You counter that we hold bodily determination as more important than right to life, define ""We"". 

""We"" as in me and you? Yes, i agree entirely, we do. On balance. 
But ""We"" are not the electorate. ""We"" are not the representation of over 60 million individual views. 

Frankly, your extension of the point regarding kidney donations is spurious and verging on reductio ad absurdum, there is a great deal of difference between abortion and forced organ donation on a number of levels. One is a positive duty to undergo invasive and damaging processes in order to prolong the naturally shortened life of another. The other is an expectation that once you create a life, willingly and voluntarily, you support that life until it is able to support itself, ie birth. Not the age of majority, just birth. 

Your example would only have worked if someone signed a contract to donate an organ should the other party need it, and then wished to back out when that person attempted to enforce. Not a random duty to offer your organs. You dont get pregnant by brushing past someone in the street. 

The child did not ask to be conceived, the woman created it, and some would say that once she does that she has a positive duty to ensure its survival in so much as doing so does not risk her own. 

As ive said, i'm not pro-life, i support choice, but i dont dismiss the pro-life side of the debate, they have valid points. 

&gt;This is why I brought up ""should"" vs ""is"". Mandate is a moral matter, a matter of ""should"". Mandate does not exist as a political entity. There is no part of our political system that takes mandate into account, tries to quantify it, or give it political weight. It's an idea that people can invoke to persuade, like patriotism or community.
As such, it is the subject or moral ""should"" arguments, not political ""is"" arguments. Yes, the Tory party have the political power to do whatever the want. But should they do whatever they want, irrespective of the belief distribution of the people of Britain? That is what the idea of mandate attempts to answer.

Lets break this down very simply - Mandate is the authority and duty to act in a direction given by the electorate. If the electorate vote for you based on your stated aims, then your mandate is to follow those aims. Are you obliged to do so, by any parliamentary mechanism, no, other than perhaps the whips. But if you don't then you have potentially betrayed your voters and usurped democracy. 

The Tory mandate IS to act in this particular way. Because they were elected in accordance with the system we have based upon those aims. Until they begin acting in a way that is fundamentally opposed to the ticket on which they secured their votes, they are acting in accordance with their remit. 

The rest of parliament and the backbenchers may vote down these bills, if they even got to that stage, that is their right. 

But as an executive branch, the cabinet is tasked with implementing the policy aims of the government, and those aims should be in line with the mandate given to them by the electorate. 

Noone is saying that they should ""do what they want irrespective of the belief distribution of the people of Britain"". What im saying is that the people of Britain voted for this government, knowing what they stood for, which is as good an authority, moral and legal, as you are ever going to get. Im saying that the belief distribution of the people of Britain is clearly not as uniformly against some of these views as you seem to believe it is. Hell, belief distribution is far better measured by individual votes than by number of seats, and if you take that into account, and add in the near 4m who voted UKIP we end up with a far more right leaning distribution than we have right now. 

This subreddit is NOT a good reflection on the opinions of this country, no matter how much you or some others might wish it was. This is an echo chamber for leftist, socialist socially and fiscally liberal thought.

They are getting significantly less screwed over than ever in history, but to say they are the only ones to blame for their situation is rather idealistic.

Tarrifs and subsidies are currently the main way those countries get screwed by developed nation. They do not have much that we want and they need the currency to develop and import the stuff they cannot produce. The few things that they can produce and we want are either commodities or low-medium quality easy to produce goods. Generally very price sensitive exports. (Non agricultural commodities are slightly different, as developed countries do want them and generally do not put tarrifs on those - but they often get extracted and traded by Western companies which sign very favourable deals for themselves. Now corruption is defninitely something that they can be blamed for, but having western companies willing to bribe officials in third world countries is not helping one bit).

2. Your anecdote does not really change anything (and fwiw the migrant workers that work for me live in shared accomm and normal accomm but certainly not 6 to a 3 bed house). migrant workers still need somewhere to live - houses aren't magically changing into something different when they turn up so yes there is in fact a direct demand result on all housing stock (which is linked to each other anyways). 

3. ahahahaha - crazy how the ONS ask you before they published their report eh?

&gt; Nigel Farrage can bluster on about ""uncontrolled migration"" until the cows come home but we need population growth to sustain our economy because our productivity is shit.

i think perhaps you don't understand productivity (its a measure of output vs input). if we had static population and improved productivity the economy would grow. and on the question of needing population growth - well you clearly cant do that forever so what then? you are the one adamant that they don't build high rises or any house (god forbid) near your beloved winchester!?

your whole thread is confusing and somewhat contradictory:

- don't want new houses / but do want lots of migrants
- don't think migrants live in the same kind of houses as non-migrants (i must have missed the migrant specific houses building programme)
- think that high rises is the only way to build houses
- think that the south east is the only place that anyone wants to live
- seems to think you can only improve productivity with immigration
- think your opinion on migration is likely more accurate than ONS (despite of course quoting the ONS when it agrees with your arguments)",null,0,null,1431685334,null,0,false,0,cr9v6p1,null,t3_35xfnc,null,t1_cr9v6p1,null,t1_cr9uryz,null,null,null,1433076259,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

In context, though, they were comparing Nigel Farage with ordinary German citizens in the 1930s. It's easy to dismiss a ""slippery slope"" argument as just that, but sometimes it is worth looking back at things.

Over the last 15 years Parliament has passed laws allowing for indefinite imprisonment without charge, unreasonable stop and searches by police, brief questioning and detention without grounds, with no lawyer and no privilege against self-incrimination. Powers of exile, curfew, dispersal. Laws banning drawings or pictures of perfectly legal things - because of outrage following particularly serious crimes.

We've had the government go before a court and argue that it can rely on evidence obtained through torture, without having to disclose the evidence or its source. We've had Parliament rush through laws so the government can win active legal proceedings, restricting grounds of appeal, and reducing what evidence can be admissible. We've had a government learn that a batch of criminal offences had been legally unenforceable for 25 years and, rather than publicly apologise to those who were illegally arrested, fined and/or imprisoned, quietly pass a new law fixing the hole.

We've had senior politicians call for the legalisation of discrimination on grounds of race or nationality, ministers blatantly lie about things within the scope of their duties. We've had a Home Secretary make constitutional history by being found in contempt of court (for failing to release an individual she was detaining illegally, despite giving an undertaking to the court that she would). A Lord Chancellor showing complete ignorance as to what his role is. A Prime Minister openly stating that merely following the law is no longer enough when attacking extremism (where we all know the subject is Islam).

But the really depressing thing isn't that politicians are doing this - but that they have broad popular support for it.

I'm not sure it's a problem with individual politicians, or with a particular political party, or politicians, or the tabloids or press. It seems to be cultural.

According to Cameron just obeying the law isn't enough for you to not be a suspect. And this is reflected in the Snooper's Charter: mandatory data retention for **everyone** regardless of whether you've actually done something wrong.
We're now moving from innocent until proven guilty to, presumed guilty until proven innocence.

Aside from the law being so broad that almost anything can be interpreted as 'terror' or 'hate crime', it's hard to see why the law is being pushed so hard without some shady motive.

 Once Labour loses its socialist voice Labour is lost, that's my view on it. Reforming the party in this image is a monumental task and as you'll see with TUSC, some feel it's beyond the pale. 

For me as long as New Labour is left in the past there's a chance. People forget Blair actually promised the renationalisation of the railways and never delivered, that was New Labour's failing for me, it offered a centrist narrative with some popular socialist polices thrown in and never delivered on them. 

Simply shifting back to Old Labour would be a disaster, and I agree Labour is best when it drops the gimmicks and unites. 

I shudder when I hear terms like 'aspiration' in the way its used. Doesn't everyone aspire to get on? 'Wealth creators' is another one, the rich are not these benevolent beings that bless us all with their trickling wealth. 

With Umunna now dropping out I feel a lot better about the leadership contest, and from what I've seen I believe Andy Burnham is the man to take Labour forward.

I've gone slightly off-topic here but I agree that Labour needs to stop looking to old 'isms' and new gimmicks and focus on the future.

* Three weeks ago I made an appointment with my GP to talk about some test results. It has potential to be bad. It's not for another 3 weeks.

* My 6 months old son is already on waiting lists for primary schools.

* I can't get a home because the deposits needed are ~£30k and the mortgages are £150k, and regardless of whatever anybody says, you can't escape the simple principle of supply and demand.

There are simply too many people here. Our infrastructure cannot cope. It isn't coping. We need to invest just to catch up. 200,000 net inward migration per year is ok when you're building America, but in 21st century Britain it's just moronic. There's really no other word for it.

I disagree with building on the green belt. I see no virtue in sticking buildings everywhere when there are other solutions, particularly when our roads and train lines are already packed to bursting. I would rather we built more garden cities like Welwyn and Milton Keynes than just stick more houses around little towns in the countryside with 14th century road layouts.

My understanding is that it used to be the case that you'd need a job offer before you could live somewhere permanently. It was free movement of labour, not free movement of people. I don't see a problem with visa wavering for two months to give new arrivals a chance to get a job, and if they don't get one then they have to go home for a while before they 'reset the clock' if you like.

But I don't get why people can come here and just live here because they like the idea of it. Doesn't add up to me. I feel no compulsion to keep the doors open at any and all expense.

Though I wonder what with the increase in child poverty,  benefits cuts hitting the most vulnerable in already economically deprived areas, cameron probably could be contributing to lowering the lifespans of economically disadvantaged people by lowering their living standards and access to state institutions that help the poor.

 as another poster above has highlighted Suicide rates, economic disadvantage, drugs and alcohol all contribute to a decline in living standards and life expectancy. 
Cameron's not killing people directly, but he is not helping at the other end of the scale of life. 
A&amp;e waiting times are up, access to medical care is being restricted, that's a quick way to speed up the death rate. He is against curbing excess energy profits at the expense of a few tens of thousands of pensioners dying for lack of affordable heating.GDP per capita is down as a result of his policies, meaning people are poorer. Malnourishment leading to poor health. It all adds up.

Plus, most of the biggest party reforms happened before Blair too.

The policy review which shifted Labour to the centre happened under Kinnock, the curtailing of the power of the union block vote happened under Smith. All Blair really did, reform wise, was the New Labour rebranding and the mostly symbolic rewriting of Clause IV.

Blair was obviously a very effective leader who definitely boosted Labour support, but it's far from unreasonable to suggest that Labour would have won in 1997 even if the more traditional John Smith had survived and Blair had stayed in the Shadow Cabinet.

My point is, you can't just attribute such changes to one man. Blair was just one of a number of factors that led to 1997 and there are any number of factors that could produce a Labour win in 2020.

This is not the case with my sister in law's kettle, which has had the same consistantly disgusting metallic taste for at least a year, if not longer. The tastes were *identical*. Not sure why it has disappeared from the office, but not from my sister in laws.

The changes in the office environment are:

- Tea variety has been changed from PG Tips to Yorkshire. So perhaps it's the tea, not the kettle? Not sure what tea my sister in law uses. I will try and find out about her tea and kettle, but I must do so surrupticiously. She would be most offended if she discovered that her tea was the subject of a Which? investigation.
- Kettle has now seen some weeks of continuous use, whereas before it was brand new. Possibly it's something that usually washes off, but in some cases doesn't?

The cause is definitely not leaving the water in the kettle.

I think migration is necessary. I never said I don't want new houses, but I don't want cheap shitty ones plonked around the place.

&gt; don't think migrants live in the same kind of houses as non-migrants

Migrant workers don't, that's who we're talking about. Because they don't bring their families, but they do send money home. That's what a migrant worker is. That's how you know they'll go home in a few years.

&gt; think that high rises is the only way to build houses

Oh fuck off. I said that since many jobs are compressed inside big cities, you've got 2 options *for those jobs* - build up (which we don't do well) or get people in and out using mass transit (which we also don't do well).

&gt; think that the south east is the only place that anyone wants to live

No. I said you can virtually give someone a free house in lots of places, but they won't get a job. You yourself said about rebalancing away from the SE, then I asked you how this might be done and if you had an example of another country that had managed it, but you didn't respond to that point.

*“We had human rights before 1998”

This is true. That’s because we had the European Convention on Human Rights. The UK ratified the Convention when it was first created in 1953, although it resisted the right of British citizens to take cases before the European Court until 1966. Since then, everyone in Britain has been protected by it; laws in Britain had to comply with the European Convention and claims of a violation could be taken to the European Court, just as they can now.

Another option is do a CBT course (CBT being Compulsary Basic Training in this context - it's a day long course for about £110, and qualifies you to ride a motorcycle up to 125cc) and get a cheap little motorbike. I did this when I was living in Aber and working in Machynlleth, and it worked out cheaper than commuting on the bus or train.

I've used all the products in the range and I like them all.

*Cleanser* is great, pH 5.5 but it has SLS so I can't use it anymore. But it is a great simple cleanser.

*Scrub* I LOVE LOVE this scrub, but it has micro beads and those are so bad for the environment :(

*Toner* is great, it's a very low AHA. It won't do any strong exfoliation, but it will be gentle and moisturising.

*Moisturiser with SPF* I love this. I really love this, but during the warmer months it is actually too thick and heavy on my skin. For my brother and my mother this is fine. But I can't.

*Night cream* same as the day cream. I wake up with an oil slick during warmer months.

We had 2 years when the cuts started and the economy suffered, so Osborne changed tact created a new time frame, pushing all cuts until a later date. That's part of why their rhetoric changed from ""no deficit"" to ""halved the deficit"". And it is why they were saying they would cut so much this parliament (12b more than Labour IIRC, which is very significant). 

Further, the growth the UK has seen is underlined by dramatically low productivity numbers (2 UK employees are producing similar levels as 1 French or German employee last I checked), which is coupled with low wages. Meaning non of the growth is translating into benefits for the middle class, which Osborne tried to hide through a buoyant housing market (which some argue is creating another bubble) and targeted giveaways. 

As I said elsewhere, he has been very good at using the economy as a political tool, but not very good at making it a stable and strong facet of our society.

However, that is not the case. Sometimes at the outset, the ""efficient choice"" ends up becoming the ""inefficient choice"". However, because so much has been invested into it, no one wants to put the resources in to change.

For example, have a look at your keyboard. It probably has the QWERTY set up, right? However, there are [more efficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) layouts. We just do not use them because everyone has grown up learning QWERTY. So while someone trained in QWERTY is going to be a slower type than someone trained in DVORAK, we do not want to use the resources needed in making the transition.

So, on point. It might be the case that fund raising for charities started out down a path which, at the time, appeared to be the better option but, right now, is in fact not - however no one is in the position to change over (change is after all hard, just look to Uber and taxis!).

What else could they have done that would be a proportionate use of police resources given the circumstances?  ANPR research would be done to narrow down an area to look for this vehicle - e.g. if its driver commutes to work on your plates every day using the same route.  If ANPR doesn't throw up any leads then really I can't think of anything else that would be reasonable or proportionate to the investigation.

&gt;Surely they would need to be the ones logging it on the PNC?

They will have done, but you had already received the NIP for speeding in the post by then, so all the office-based research for your speeding offence would have been done before you made the report, when there was no note on PNC about cloned plates.  The staff completing your speeding paperwork would have had no knowledge of the report.

Probably best to let your solicitor draft it, since he will know what will be accepted by the court as mitigation and what won't.

You may be overly ambitious wanting to use so many potentially irritant/ exfoliating actives: L-AA, AHA, BHA, tret. YOu may find you need to back off to a non acid form of L-AA or at least a lower percentage (eg. 10%).

I don't think the order of acids matters massively, personally I see exfoliation as an extension of the cleansing step so that goes first. It can also be helpful to do BHAs before other acids because they 'eat' through any sebum residue clearing the way.

CE ferulic is indeed best on bare or close to bare skin. It should not have an issue with a water based or alcohol based product that is effectively prepping the way pH wise.

null,false,northern_crusader,null,null,null,"&gt; We are currently finding our finances quite difficult to keep track of, and have been discussing the possibility of getting a joint account (we've just started using YNAB).

Everyone I know who is in financial shit as a couple have separate accounts and try the whole bill splitting bollocks. They inevitably end up with one partner with no money and missing bills. My neighbours took it to the point they were about to be evicted from their council house. 

A joint account for the bills is the best idea. Santander 123 is the best account to do this. If you really must do ""my money is my money"" and ""his/her money is his/her money"" routine, work out what all the monthly outgoings are, divide them by 2 and each transfer over your half plus 10% once a month into the account.

Personally what we do here is both throw our money into one account. Once a month we'll see what the balance is and once its over a certain figure we divvy up that excess between the both of us and transfer it into our respective ISAs. As a result we've never had money troubles.

I think for us it works because neither of us have ever viewed the money we each individually earn as our own, even though some weeks I earn three times what my wife does and when I have a quiet period she can be the sole income.

Anecdotally when I hear people over fifty living in million pound houses saying they voted for Labour I get the feeling that maybe they don't entirely represent the working class any more. The issue is that the majority of people don't consider themselves to be working class any more. With commodities being so cheap it's very possible for people to have a relatively high standard of living on a fairly normal wage. On top of that many jobs requiring high levels of education are relatively poorly paid compared to some jobs requiring skilled labour. Combine that with so many sole traders in  skilled-labour-heavy industries (bricklaying, dry lining, roofing etc) who are now going to vote Conserative because they don't like paying tax... It's a perfect storm of the Labour party trying to appeal to a demographic of people who don't really exist any more.

Labour need to step back and figure out what their principles are and how to reach out to those sections of society.

Only[ 6.8%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18623096) of the UK's land is classified as urban. Once you take into account green areas like parks, the amount of land actually ""built on"" is 2.27%. The idea of population growth changing Britain's landscape in any significant way (into an ""urban jungle"") is not based in reality. Even with double our current population, Britain would still be overwhelmingly rural in land use. 

The UK's population grew by around [400,000](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-uk--england-and-wales--scotland-and-northern-ireland/2013/sty-population-changes.html) people in 2013, of which around half was due to migration. If we assume that rate stays steady, how crowded will Britain get? It certainly sounds like a lot of people.

At that rate of population growth, it will take the UK 44 years to reach a population of 82,120,931 in 2059, at which point the UK will have the same population density as present-day Japan, at 337.1/km^2. 

That puts things into perspective. People in Japan enjoy a high quality of life, and the country is full of huge swathes of rural land and areas natural beauty in addition to large cities. That level of population density is hardly the end of the world. Many would in fact consider it desirable. More people, bigger economy, more global influence.

Assuming the same area of land use per person, urban land use would increase from 6.8% to 8.7% with a population of 82,120,931. Still not anything close to an urban jungle. And with likely greater use of high-rise buildings, the land use per person would likely go down, so the percentage would probably be lower (as it is in Japan).

Of course the distribution of those people in the UK will be uneven, most likely centred around London, Birmingham and Manchester. But this does little to displace the comparison with Japan, since Japan also has very uneven population distribution. Compare the northern island of Japan, Hokkaido, and Scotland:

Scottish population: 5,327,700

Scottish land area: 78,387 km2

Hokkaido population: 5,507,456

Hokkaido land area: 83,453 km2

Japan is just as full of large, empty spaces as the UK is. 

But what about the infrastructure point? Surely the UK's infrastructure can't keep up? This is simply not the case. 

Examples of people having to wait to use services etc. are not historically unusual. It's got very little to do with migration or population growth, and everything to do with budgets. As migrants contribute to budgets via taxation as well as use services, they do not contribute to budgetary strain. EU migrants are a net benefit to the treasury: EU immigrants made a [net contribution of £20bn](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-EU-immigration) to UK public finances between 2000 and 2011.

But what about the speed of change? Maybe if immigration is fast enough, it doesn't matter that they more than pay their way, simply because it takes time to build stuff?

This does not stand up to historical analysis. The UK's population growth of 400,000 a year is historically unremarkable, amounting to a 0.6% annual growth. In 1971 the UK had a population of 55,928,000, and grew to 64,511,000 today, a growth of 15% in 44 years. If population growth remains at the current rate and we grow to 82,120,931 over the next 44 years, that will be a growth of 27%. It's not hugely faster, and when you consider other historical periods it becomes even less remarkable: the population grew from 38 million in 1901 to 46 million in 1931, or 32% in 30 years.

Britain's infrastructure will be no more or less strained by the population than it has been historically. And in fact, economic performance is the real determining factor of infrastructure burden, not population growth.

People generally overestimate how long it takes to build things, and how expensive they are. Take as an example Norfolk on Norwich University Hospital, which serves the entire city of Norwich and a large amount of the surrounding area. It took 3.5 years to build at cost £229 million. Building can obviously keep up, and we have the money: compare the extra £20bn of tax revenues from migrants over a 10 year period to the £229 million to build a hospital. The UK could have built 87 new hospitals between 2001 and 2011 from the extra tax revenues from migrants alone.

The real issue at the moment is housing, but that's a political issue. Everyone knows the solution, which is building more houses. It doesn't have to be a problem, it's simply political forces are keeping it a problem.",null,0,null,1431691343,null,0,1431691639,0,cr9wt8o,null,t3_361j2l,null,t1_cr9wt8o,null,t1_cr9vu59,null,null,null,1433077025,null,12,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,12,null

The first match I ever went to was a villa match, but it wasn't at Villa Park. It was at the Hawthorns of all places, and it wasn't even against the baggies. If I remember correctly an intertoto cup match against an eastern European team. I couldn't tell you the score but I remember leaving and thinking I've seen everything in the match: a red card, a penalty, a goal from a free kick, hit both posts and the bar.


 We all eat, sleep and breathe Villa in my family. We've even got a brick from the old trinity road stand framed up on the wall (the frame is even made from the old wood from the stand). My dad has seen Villa win everything there is to win (except the elusive FA cup), even went to the game in Rotterdam on that famous night. I even remember going on camping holidays as a child with my family and my dad would tell us stories before we went to sleep. They were ridiculous, made up stories about Pongo Waring (Fact: Villa's all time top goal scorer over one season, who had a reputation as somewhat of a lunatic).

Picture was painted that Labour was unsafe with the economy and would bring chaos due to the SNP.

Like being called a murder and not challenging that asking if you can baby sit some kids may have some fantastic series of references but does not matter. 
 
If you ask most people they don't ask if a policy is right wing or left wing or in the middle.  Still stand by the idea that most people won't disagree with wanting a fairer, greener world and simple along with progressive tax system.  If you look at the the Tories did they did not talk about the policies which most people disagree with but focus with stuff people liked.  Effective communication along with the message that things are best in their hands. 

Labour needs to focus on the interesting engagement along with a strategy which takes them back to every voter group even the ones which don't vote.  If the no voters was a party they would be the biggest single party. Party needs the working class, middle class and old to vote for them along with the young voters to get into the habit of voting for them. Changing demographics means we need to focus on every group and can't take for granted any. 

This may require some serious structural changes in how the party is run and speaking to voters. Along with a clear long term strategy to make sure we're part of the community again. Ed showed some real balls in speaking to Russell brand that just one step we need to take.

Populist parties are able to get some serious engagement with voters time for us to learn from them and the SNP. Not saying we should take on their own policy but look at how they run things.

null,false,samlu1999,,Year 11,null,"Ehh ill briefly sum up some of the longer questions that I remember

The 6 marker: The ion exchange column exchanges calcium and magnesium ions for hydrogen and sodium ions using a resin. In this way, the ions making the water hard are gone. The advantage to this is that it is a continuous automatic process.
The addition of sodium carbonate reacts the calcium and magnesium ions with the sodium carbonate creating a precipitate of calcium carbonate. In this way the calcium and magnesium ions are taken out of the water and it is no longer hard. The advantage of this is that no sodium ions are produced unlike the ion exchange column, and sodium ions contribute to heart disease.

For the 5 marker on comparing the precipitation to the titration, some obvious disadvantages of the precipitation is that not all of the barium hydroxide would have reacted, and some of the precipitate would be lost when dried and weighed. Some more iffy points are that titration takes more time, requires more specialist equipment (burette and pippete filler etc...), disadvantages of titration is that indicator is required, and people might not swirl/read indicator correctly.

The last question on why 50cm3 would make no difference to 25cm3 is because there is twice the volume so Q=mcdeltaT, twice the energy is needed to heat it. So although twice the HCl will react producing twice the heat, the overall delta T is constant.

The questions on equilibria: Increasing the temperature decreases the amount of Hydrogen iodide since the forward reaction is endothermic, and increasing temp favors the endothermic.
Increasing the pressure would increase the amount of ammonia formed since N2 _3H2 = 2NH3, there are 4 moles to 2, and increasing the pressure favors the reaction that produces the least volume.",null,0,null,1431694568,null,0,false,0,cr9xzcm,null,t3_361wp9,null,t1_cr9xzcm,null,t3_361wp9,null,null,null,1433077577,null,3,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,3,null

With financial firepower becoming increasingly important and regularly talked about here, Liverpool aren't in the position to go around wasting money. If you do bring Ings and he falls behind Origi, I'd say that's a waste of money. 

&gt; We do need more players than just starters, you do realise that yes?

Do you though? You've bought a lot of players last year and have decent depth, I thought this window was more about signing players for the first 11? Isn't that why people are clamouring for proven talent?

&gt;  Borini has proved he isn't effective or reliable as a starter or a sub and so he needs to go, and the same could be said of Lambert/Balotelli

Aren't those minutes going to new striker/Sturridge/Origi, why sign Ings? it's not as if Lambert of Borini played much this season.",null,0,null,1431694964,null,0,false,0,cr9y55r,null,t3_361xis,null,t1_cr9y55r,null,t1_cr9xpg2,null,null,null,1433077652,null,-2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-2,null

Going on about historic rates of population growth is dull. 'Britain used to grow at 3% a year, now it's only 0.6%. We're doing fine.' What's the point of saying that? A town growing at 3% 40 years ago is fine when it means an extra 1,000 people on roads which could, at the time, handle an extra 500 cars. Today, 0.6% growth in the same town might be 2,000 people, meaning an extra 1,000 cars on single carriage-way roads which have been there since 1326 and have so many buildings alongside them that there's no reasonable case for knocking them down to widen the road and free up congestion. I don't care about percentages and rate. I care about real numbers. I care about infrastructure which we can't expand because it's impossible.

Saying

&gt;If population growth remains at the current rate and we grow to 82,120,931 over the next 44 years, that will be a growth of 27%. It's not hugely faster, and when you consider other historical periods it becomes even less remarkable

Is just silly. Who gives a flying fuck if it's a slow rate of growth historically? WHERE ARE WE GOING TO PUT AN EXTRA 20 MILLION PEOPLE? 20 million people is TWO AND A HALF LONDONS' WORTH OF RESIDENTIAL AND ECONOMIC SPACE. IN HALF A LIFETIME. THAT IS INSANE.

The Japan point is off the mark. Their quality of life is based on things like diet and nutrition and meditation practices like yoga. It's cultural. Saying, 'high population isn't a problem: look at Japan,' is naive when you don't take into account the cultural differences. Do Japanese people buy cakes for the office on a Friday afternoon? Do they have diets loaded with sugar and salt? Do they punish their livers with alcohol in their youth like young people in Western societies? Do they smoke as much?

Trying to link demographics with quality of life 'just like that' is pretty naive, if we're honest.

And what difference does it make of the migrants are a benefit to the Treasury? That's just one step away fro, 'Pack 'em in, boys, there's space in Cornwall. Let's get rich.' Who cares? That doesn't explain why these people have the right to just turn up and live here.

And the whole, 'More money, more money will solve everything,' is absurd. Am I expected to be taxed til my tits are purple my whole life just because you're kind of scared that you'll look a bit racist if you say, 'Hey let's take another look at the immigration situation'? Cheers, mate.

Reading your comment just makes me think you're a student/single young flatsharer and haven't yet had to deal with the responsibilities of family living in an overcrowded country. Why don't you put your facts and figures down for five seconds and start with qualitative research instead of quantitative? How are any of those figures supposed to make me feel any better?

&gt;The UK could have built 87 new hospitals between 2001 and 2011 from the extra tax revenues from migrants alone.

BUT IT DIDN'T! What good is it saying what *could* have been done when those things aren't happening!? And even then, where would you put an extra 87 hospitals?

&gt;The real issue at the moment is housing, but that's a political issue. Everyone knows the solution, which is building more houses. It doesn't have to be a problem, it's simply political forces are keeping it a problem.

And what happens when there's no more space? What happens when more people come live here because they think, 'Hey Britain just keeps on building shit. There's space there because they'll keep making more. Sweet, let's roll'? What happens when we've bought all the farmland from the farmers and turned Britain into a concrete sprawl? What happens when we're 100% dependent on shipping lanes to eat instead of the current 50%? 3% is not a small number when it comes to area that we've built on. 3% is a big number. We need the other 97% for farms so we can feed 60 million people, and a lot of that we can't even farm anyway because it's forest or mountainous regions like Scotland and Wales.

Borini - no minutes, Lambert - very little, Aspas - lol, Balotelli - minutes taken up by new ""top class"" striker.

&gt; That means we will have just Sturridge and Origi. And we cant go to the season with just 2 strikers. One that cant play full season and one that never played in Premier League.

But you're ignoring the hypothetical of Liverpool signing a new striker? Let's not forget about Sterling who can play upfront. Just because Sturridge isn't going to play every game, it doesn't mean he's going to get less games than this season.

&gt; We need 3 I would argue 4 strikers (2 top, Origi and Ings battling for minutes) so even when Sturridge is out we could still play our style.And often we want to play with 2 strikers. (Sturridge/Sterling, Markovic/Sterling, Sterling/Coutinho once) so it would be ideal to have 2 proven strikers and 2 competitive back up strikers that could fill in.

No chance you'll sign 3 strikers (ignoring Origi), that's ludicrous. You can't just plan a squad with the assumption that Sturridge is out all season. You can't just buy players and hope 1 will work. Unless of course, I've misread and you consider Sturridge to be 1 of the ""top"" strikers. If you're going back to 3-5-2 then it's a completely different matter which I've stated in the original post.

&gt; Origi and Ings can both play as a wingers so I bet they will get plenty minutes with our injury prone players

So, if a NHS hospital treats a case of pneumonia, they pay VAT on the antibiotics, but they cannot reclaim it. 

If a decorator  buys a tin of paint to paint a room, then he pays VAT on the paint, but reclaims it on his VAT return. 

In order to encourage private contractors in public services, the government introduced a tax break which allowed public services to reclaim VAT in certain circumstances. Typically, if the service was ""fully managed"" without any capital costs to the public sector. 

For example, a hospital needs to buy 100 PCs. The PCs cost 500 + VAT. The cost to the hospital's bottom line is 60k.
Now let's say Managed PC services Ltd. Comes along. They can buy the PCs for 500 + VAT, but as the VAT is reclaimed, the bottom line cost is £50k. The PCs are then rented to the hospital on a 5 year contract at £11750 per year. The hospital gets the PCs for less, and a private contractor skims off nearly 20%.

null,false,SpudSmusher,null,null,null,"&gt; How can you say that though? He's only 22 and has looked really good in a terrible team this season (his first in the prem). For all we know he could join and do a Harry Kane or a Sturridge.

Because he's played at lower levels for most of his career, and with how scouting works these days its nigh on impossible to pull a gem like that, especially with the type of player he is. As for Sturridge, he was pretty highly rated back when he played for Man City, and signed on pretty high wages iirc when he joined Chelsea. Harry Kane hit a purple patch, can't see it continuing. Origi on the other hand, far better prospect, played at the world cup. Seems a way better ""gamble"" so to speak.

&gt;We'll have a lot of games next season with Europa League so I imagine everyone will get their chances. I doubt he will take too much time away from Origi (who can also play out wide btw so if Ings is doing particularly well up top it's not like he won't get playtime at all).

But you played in the Champions League and Europa League this season whilst getting to the semis of both cups. I can't imagine Liverpool playing that many more games. If you are playing one man up front, surely Hypothetical Striker, Sturridge, Origi and Sterling is enough depth for up front? 

&gt; Or maybe rodgers is planning on reverting to two up top?

That'll be a whole different discussion then and I'd understand signing Ings.

&gt; Basically we've been fucked in the arse this year because of our lack of strikers so I think we are looking to bring in as many as possible so it doesn't happen again, relying on Sturridge this season was an absolutely ridiculous thing to do by Rodgers.

See that's what I don't get. If you do sign Hypothetical top class striker, that's 2 more strikers to use this next season.

Not top players but with Lallana and Lovren - two of the best performers in the premier league that season. Markovic was also highly sought after by a lot of big clubs. Another 20m on Moreno, 10m on Can, 10m on Origi and 16m on Balotelli. Of course a lot of this spending spree was offset from the sale of Suarez, who was probably one of the biggest stars of the world cup in 2012 and we managed to sign him. 

Glen Johnson and Alberto Aquilini were also top players when we signed them Aquilani didn't work out but Johnson was a top signing from Chelsea at the time.

And let's not forget Mascherano, Alonso and Torres. Torres especially was a huge signing, one of the most sought after young strikers in Europe at the time. It was a while ago but you did say within a decade :)

Yeah, there's no need to be a twat about it mate. Not everywhere reports the same fees.

&gt;The ranges are pretty arbitrary, feel free to make it out however you like and as I said by comparison I would suspect our average signing age is a bit less than others

I'd imagine it's a lot lower yeah. But it's not just about the ages, it's about what those players have actually done in their careers.

&gt; I'm not sure how you can say the last bit considering we spent £44M alone on just Lallana and Downing.

I wouldn't consider either of them to be the kind of players I'm talking about though. Lallana had been good in the Prem, but he'd never played in Europe. Downing was never more than mid-table, and had only had a few appearances in the UEFA Cup.

&gt;on the older side

Downing was 25 when we signed, and Lallana 26. I really do not think that is 'on the older side'.

&gt;it seems hardly fair to say FSG do not spend on that category, more that it's fair to say they probably see it as less than ideal, which it is.

It's less than ideal from their business perspective.

I still think he has something to prove that we haven't seen yet. I think his minutes coming on in the second half of the last two games have made him look like the brightest on the field. 

Like everyone else, I liked Elia after his first run out. But it's clear he's got no link up play and can't even put a ball into the box so I have no interest in a winger without those traits. Especially with a big man in the middle. 

I want to see some youth get subbed on at attack. Seager and Gallagher are both worthy. 

I want JWP to start as well - I know he 'can't shoot' but I think that was heavily mental. I think about it as he was able to get open and get a look at goal more times than anyone to be honest. I think with some confidence up he'll start making more of those opportunities. 

Edit: Just watched RK's pre-matched. ~~I don't expect Schneiderlin, even if he's fit he's probably not match fit.~~ Reed needs more time to shine in Koeman's eyes to size up for next year. 

I wouldn't drop Wanyama. I think he just needs a wake-up call and a home game. 

Gazza - I don't know much about him. He's looked pretty good in U21 games. I'm at least interested to see him play again, despite my lack of faith in general.

Johnson is a decent-ish shout, but he came from Portsmouth, a club struggling with finances at the time, and at a time when there were loads more right backs in the EPL better than him. Aquilani was definitely not a top player when we bought him, but again, had potential.

Mascherano and Alonso had both yet to prove their abilities before coming to Liverpool. So, again, potential, not current top players. Torres is the closeset we've come, but even then, his hype mostly came from the WC. He only averaged 15 goals a year as a striker at Atletico before coming here. His move is debatable, but I still don't class him as a top player before he came to Liverpool.

The larger point I was making is that buying top players in the world when they are top players has never really been Liverpool's MO, at least not in recent years (I'm 28 and haven't done my research into the club from too far in the past).

I think the sort of people who enjoy Mrs Browns Boys are the sort of people who never really 'got' Ted, but laughed at Father Jack saying feck.

Wacky characters are only really funny if you have a 'straight man' to balance them out.

[Bill Hader puts it well](http://www.thewrap.com/bill-hader-and-seth-meyers-reminisce-about-snl-weekend-updates-stefon-video/):

&gt; “A person being patient with an insane person is my favorite thing in the world,” he revealed. It was Meyers’ patient responses to him, trying to keep Stefon on track, that cracked him up. “You were being so patient with this maniac who had the simplest job in the world.”

Mrs Browns Boys *might* work slightly better (although it would still suck) if you had a character in that universe who was normal, and was patiently trying to deal with this wacky old man in drag. That might warrant a laugh.

That's why Father Ted was such a genius show, you have this normal guy who isn't even sure how he ended up as a priest, on this island full of lunatics!

When everybody is 'wacky' and nobody is 'normal', then it just isn't funny.

I do agree with your post though, I think Ings is basically purely business motivated. If he improves massively I think we'd look to keep him, but I think if he performs adequately he'd be the first to be sold.

The only counterpoint I would make is the relative ages of the players we could have playing upfront. If we consider that we buy a top class striker, he's probably going to be 26/27+. Sturridge is 25. Ings will be 22, and Origi 20.

If new striker A performs well, we may get 2/3 years out of him if we hang on to him. At that time Sturridge will be 27/28 and hopefully established as a top quality, world class striker if he continues to improve. Ings will be 24/25, and will have either improved so much that he's a top quality back up and we'd be loathe to let him go, or he hasn't improved and we sell him for a profit. Origi will be 22/23 and well on his way to an established option upfront.

It could be considered a tactic to stagger the ages/experience levels of our strikers, but I'm only making a hypothesis, and I think the ultimate reason is just to turn a profit on a young English striker.",null,0,null,1431699534,null,0,false,0,cra0be4,null,t3_361xis,null,t1_cra0be4,null,t1_cr9ys63,null,null,null,1433078747,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

He did that, but beforehand he arranged with the national executive committee that he sits on that they would reject his resignation.

So there you go. He's a man of his word, and not like other politicians who will lie and rely on technicalities to claim that they kept their promise.

In fairness, it was a professional promise and not a political one. It was a promise to his supporters and he clearly had in mind a situation where UKIP has MPs but he isn't one of them, in which case it would not be credible for him to remain leader. UKIP doesn't have MPs, so it doesn't apply - the only real reason he has to resign... is that he said he would. If you make a promise and your supporters don't want you to keep it and your opponents do want you to... do you keep it? Who are you really betraying by not doing so?

The main issue is the pressure on existing roads and infrastructure, and the ultimately shite quality of most of these new estates. The planning process should be overhauled so that quality of design and integration with surrounding neighbourhoods/greenspaces is prioritised over number of houses and proximity to existing areas, and there needs to be some way of ensuring infrastructure is upgraded alongside development that allows something better than isolated estates seperated by scraps of landscaping and roads for traffic distribution.

The city either grows outward to an extent, or overheats like London.

Origi will join, but depending on our transfer activity, will probably go on loan in the PL (I think BR has gone on record saying this is the plan). He may stay, which would give us Sturridge as the only senior striker and Origi and Sinclair as unproven options up top.  Sterling will continue as a makeshift striker but likely will drop back to his more natural wing position, where I expect him to compete with Origi (should Origi stay), Ibe, Markovic, Coutinho and Lallana - I fully expect BR to TRY to revert to a 4-3-3/4-5-1 next season but this depends on other signings. As you'll see below, I think we'll end up seeing a whole bunch of formations. 

This means we need 2 more strikers (assuming Balotelli, Borini and Aspas are moved on - sold or loaned away), one as back-up and one ""marquee."" If Balotelli stays then he will be a back-up alongside Ings. If Sturridge stays fit and we get a striker who hit the ground running, then it will be 2 up top like how we did it when Suarez was around. We will either play 3-5-2 (which we are accustomed to) or 4-4-2 diamond (which we also know works, but requires us to get someone in the bottom of the diamond who has more legs than Lucas and Gerrard do).

Tactical flexibility is BR's thing at this point, so depending on the game and the personnel, expect us to line up with any of the 3-4-3/3-5-2, 4-3-3/4-5-1, or 4-4-2/4-3-1-2 (each pair consists of the offensive and defensive formation in-game) formations we've seen this and last season.

I don't really see Ings as what we need. We're NOT going to play with two upfront, whatever hypothetical scenario we seem to think, it's just not Brendan's formation. It was only done with Sturridge and Suarez because, well, why the hell wouldn't you?!

Origi should be our priority for backup minutes. To me, that means starting League Cup, early round Europa League matches to get some serious game time. If players, especially strikers, don't get this it will seriously hamper development. Do we want these precious starts going to Ings, already 2 years older than Origi, or the kid with much higher potential?

Plus, there seems to be a belief that giving him minutes on the wing would be beneficial. This attitude to me is the worst part. Why the hell would we stick our hugely talented young striker out on the wing, where he will learn nothing AS A STRIKER, potentially to accommodate Ings?!

Cameron isn't talking about Evangelical Christianity and our state religion is not Evangelical Christianity.

Efficiency is in the eye of the beholder but I'd say in increasing order of importance based on how long you're actively typing at your keyboard these would be most important:

* Learning certain base skills you don't have (touch typing)
* Learning how to effectively use your applications and their extended functionality (even if you don't currently use 90% of the functionality in Excel it's good to be aware of it)
* Critically assessing your workspace and equipment (not everyone is most comfortable in the [generic posture](https://cybersafetynet.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/sitting-computer.jpg) position)
* Tweaking your desktop/interface
* Changing work methodology (Pomodoro, self-assessment tools such as RescueTime / ManicTime)
* Researching alternative solutions to problems if you feel your approach could be improved.
* Acquiring applications to more effectively perform certain tasks that can otherwise be time consuming/awkward. 

Once you've optimized those as much as you can then keyboard layout could be one of the next things to look at on the list. The benefit of the list above is they don't just improve your efficiency but they also help your physical and mental well-being.

null,false,SpudSmusher,null,null,null,"&gt; Is there any reason you don't see Kane continuing his form? I think calling purple patch kind of undermines him playing very well for the season. I'm not a Spurs fan at all, but as a future England striker he needs all the support we can give.

From the top of my head, the main 3 reasons that I can see why its just a purple patch are:

1. In terms of footballing ability, Kane doesn't really excel at anything. He doesn't have amazing physical attributes, his movement/intelligence isn't anything special, doesn't have sublime technical ability etc. I think its just a purple patch because a lot of the time he shoots and it goes in often just because he hits it hard. He hasn't demonstrated world class finishing and as we've seen in the past few games, he has faded and done nothing in the past few games because the purple patch is fading.

1. His reputation has increased, managers will be more tactically aware of what he does and will mark him tighter or use more players to stop him. If we combine this with the first point of him being not exceptionally good at anything, I think he'll struggle. 

1. Spurs are shit. They don't have much creatively. I don't think Eriksen is that great in terms of dictating play or making chances and Spurs are so ridiculously inconsistent, Harry kane will be the same. 

Obviously I could be completely wrong and he could go on to become better than Shearer but let's hope that's not the case.

&gt; I do agree with your post though, I think Ings is basically purely business motivated. If he improves massively I think we'd look to keep him, but I think if he performs adequately he'd be the first to be sold.

Not a fan of buying to sell later on. It's a very short term look and I'd argue that most successful clubs are successful because of long term planning. This is especially the case in the Prem where you have 4 clubs that are financially stronger than Liverpool and I don't think Liverpool should be wasting valuable minutes on a good but not special striker when its so competitive. Making a few million here and there by flipping Ings isn't a great idea imo.

The idea of staggering ages/experience levels I'm not sure I agree with, if we were talking about Ings having top class potential then I can see the idea but realistically that's not the case. Considering Origi has already started for his country in the world cup, I don't really see the point in getting Origi less minutes as he has clearly shown top class potential.

&gt; This means we need 2 more strikers (assuming Balotelli, Borini and Aspas are moved on - sold or loaned away), one as back-up and one ""marquee.""

Literally repeated what I state in the original post, where Origi is the back up. Where does Ings fit in?

&gt; Tactics stuff

3 strikers (hypothetical top striker, sturridge, origi) + Sterling is enough depth to give you your tactical flexibility if you do want to switch to 2 up top occasionally but the post was mainly based on the fact that you will play 1 striker in a 4-3-3 for the majority of games.",null,0,null,1431702693,null,0,false,0,cra245p,null,t3_361xis,null,t1_cra245p,null,t1_cra0kh4,null,null,null,1433079595,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

I think you're right about being smart, but I do think you are doing a disservice to FSG by assuming the club already isn't highly involved in metric-based scouting and development. FSG certainly knows, and has said, that developing players is the only true way to sustain success, and I think they've done extraordinarily well, in concert with Brendan, at doing this. I can't think of another top 5 club that has given the chances to youth that Liverpool has under BR, save for perhaps Arsenal (I'd have to do some research).

And let's not forget that the Boston Red Sox were the team to really take sabermetrics from Billy Beane and apply it to a club that had a massive payroll and spending power and used it to win titles. They are on the cutting edge in the sporting world as a whole, they are just working on finding their legs in football. I really think they'd benefit from a seasoned DoF to help them. I was sort of hoping (pretty loftily) that they may approach David Dein about working with the club. I love Ian Ayre, despite most feeling very differently. He has done a fantastic job commercially with the club in one of its worst performance periods in a while. He is also a lifetime season ticket holder and truly feels like a born and bred Liverpool fan. But he has learned on the job at the same time that FSG have learned on the job, and that hasn't been working as well as they thought.

This all being said, I think there is a serious need for a discussion about whether anyone can be a consistent title threat anymore without massive amounts of spurious money from ownership. I just saw this week that Abramovich's interest-free loan to Chelsea has reached [a balance of over £1 billion](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/more-than-1billion-in-12-years--roman-abramovichs-backing-for-chelsea-10248343.html) now. In 12 years. FSG bought Liverpool in 2010 for £350-odd million. And Abramovich has loaned Chelsea 4 times that to use in the last 12 years. Honestly, with money like that, they ought to win everything every year. It's shameful.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Lets just say we start the season with 4 strikers, Sturridge, Origi, Ings, and a new marquee.

Having four decent strikers means, if Rodgers wanted, we could play 2 up top, as we've done before, with enough depth to change things round. (which to be honest is likely - if we do get a marquee signing, Rodgers isn't going to drop either the marquee or Sturridge)

Lets say Liverpool do quite well in the league/fa and europa cup, thats a potential 4 games every two weeks. Say Sturridge, or another got injured, we'd still be covered.

Ings, has now proven himself as a top flight scorer, he's 22 years old, he fits the style of play, he's English so will settle quickly. Origi, is a foreign 19 year old, with no English experience (and also operates as a left winger) and if he turns out not to be ready for the league, and we didn't have Ings, that would mean we would have 2 strikers - Sturridge (obviously injury prone) and a marquee signing (who knows how well they'll perform - look at Balotelli this year)  

You say that you don't see Ings developing into much, but you're not in a place to say that at all. Ings is really young, and scored a good amount of goals for one of the worst teams in the league. Henderson wasn't highly rated when he first came to Liverpool, and now he's one of the better midfielders in the league. Same goes for many different players, I think Chelsea fans had a similar reaction when they bought Gary Cahill in from Bolton.   

I think most fan's would agree with me when I say that, Ings is a great signing someone who can be good backup and plays like Sturridge more than Lambert.

I know that you are upset about what has happened to Labour in Scotland - but based on what happened in Quebec, the Scots won't give Lab a hearing for at least a decade. The myth-making will have the upper hand till reality intrudes.

What turned things in Quebec was when businesses horrified by the policies of the Parti Quebecois, relocated to Toronto. But it took time for the people of Quebec to notice - it has to build to a certain mass of job losses etc. And only *then* did they throw them out.

Cameron will give Sturgeon FFA and within a decade Scots will be enjoying the Quebec experience. In the meanwhile, you might want to move to England and help Lab campaign where it still has a chance.

I totally agree with your points about why give minutes to Ings. Origi has been playing pretty regularly this season in Ligue 1, he's not going to want to sit on the bench for the entire season which will be the case if Ings joins. Origi started in the world cup, dude has way higher potential and needs to play more. 

I can kind of see the point in playing him on the wings cause it will protect him from getting bullied by centre backs and help him improve his touch but Liverpool have wingers that need experience there which is why I don't buy that argument. I feel that playing on the wings sometimes hampers your striker a la Welbeck, and he loses some of the Striker's instinct which you need to develop through playing up front.

To add to what you've said, some political reforms like Proportional representation, recall elections and campaign finance reform would go well with that too. 

With regard to challenging the neoliberal consensus, focusing on the opportunities of concentrated investment in infrastructure and construction (they offer the greatest fiscal multipliers if I remember correctly) would be the way to go there I think, along with plans to shift the UK away from its heavy reliance on the South-East financial sector and towards a mixed economy (and a passionate safeguarding of the defence budget? ...Personal taste I suppose). Also reiterating the point that economics is not a zero sum game, if you slash away at government spending you end up with a bigger budget deficit than you otherwise would've done with targeted economic stimulus. The oil from the Falkland Islands (and wasn't some found in West Sussex a few months back?) should be great.

null,false,flancresty,num26,,null,"What do you think ""loosely defined"" means? I never said Livermore was a legend, but he was an academy product and I'll have a soft spot for anyone who came up through our system. Huddlestone played 130+ matches, including the glorious CL season and the previous qualifying season.

Name a single player who has come to Spurs because we've been playing in the Europa League. Just one. Please.

There is little doubt that Europa hurts our league position. If you really want to attract better players, we need Champions League football, the best path to that for us is to be out of Europa for a season. 

The amount of additional revenue for finishing 6th instead of 8th is about 2.5 million pounds, which is trivial in our total budget. Sure, we'll probably make about another 10m in revenue if we make it to say the first KO in Europa, but contrast that with the 40m+ if we qualify for the CL and it's clear to me which would be better for the club in the long-term.

null,false,lurker093287h,null,null,null,"That was a great article, but I think that he missed two things; one that traditionally and across large parts of Europe now, the old working class based parties that turned themselves into 'catch all' parties by broadening their appeal to the sub urban middle classes are being wiped out electorally. Large sections of their voters can't stomach the austerity agenda, Milliband kind of signed up to that, allbeit in a less harsh way than the Tories. I guess it might have been more unpopular if he didn't, but who knows.

I think the bit about their 'new' and 'old' constituencies was the best part, take immigration, sub urban middle class people who vote labour seem to broadly support high immigration from Europe, and you could see that some material benefit comes to them from this, cheaper home cleaning and building services etc, while in the north (depending on who you believe) some decent section of traditional labour voters voted for UKIP presumably with this issue high on their list. It seems somewhat intractable, especially in a time where the austerity picture is widely accepted and the government can't paper over the cracks. 

Also that much of the tory victory was built on the collapse of the Liberal democrat/labour, 'tactical' voting alliance, Labour voters in parts of the country where labour had little chances of winning would 'tactically' vote liberal and vice versa in parts of the country where the tories are the main challengers. Because of Clegg's decision to team up with the tories, this collapsed, but there is no particular reason why it shouldn't respawn if they have a left of centre leader.

that doesnt mean he was a great player, just because he got picked a lot. Wilson palacious also played that season but no one is calling him a 'legend'. you really think Huddlestone can hold a candle to true legends like Nicholson, Blanchflower or King?

&gt; Name a single player who has come to Spurs because we've been playing in the Europa League. Just one. Please.

you think Eriksen, Vertonghen or Lloris would of signed for us if we were finishing 8th in the table? with no european football? Because I sure as hell dont.

&gt;If you really want to attract better players, we need Champions League football, the best path to that for us is to be out of Europa for a season.

agreed that is how you get the best, but i disagree with missing out entirely is the best way to progress as a club.


&gt;Sure, we'll probably make about another 10m in revenue if we make it to say the first KO in Europa, but contrast that with the 40m+ if we qualify for the CL and it's clear to me which would be better for the club in the long-term.

but your talking about this like missing out the the Europa league will guarantee we will get CL the following season. it wont. were not good enough. were not even close to being in the top four.
