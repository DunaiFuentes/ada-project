All the training was in the form of online resources on their staff website that were optional reading. Given time I might've learned more about all the products, but yeah.

I will add that most of the customers I dealt with weren't after these little electronic widgets but after more general purpose electronics such as car USB chargers, sat navs, memory cards, hard drives, video cards, other computer related items and so on (which I was able to help more with). I think most of Maplin's trading is done through these products rather than the breadboards or resistors or wires they might have at the back.

* Suggested switching away from the fiat financial system, back into either gold or crypto-currency to stop the banks from using fiat money backed with tax receipts?
* Supports of the idea of small collectives running their own affairs?
* Wants laws separating corporate interests and government like church and state (an idea sent in by a Trews watcher, effectively proving the idea that he's creating a space for other people's ideas)
* Feels that a degree of spiritual harmony would help people to empathise more instead of being manipulated by big business into acting against their own self interest
* Wants the war on drugs ended - freeing up huge amounts of resources and taking thelegs out from criminal cartels

I mean - if you paid attention to anything he said at all, you'd know that he's pushing for a lot of ideas.

Changes to council tax are maybe the most sensible policy there. Though presumably it would only affect owners and not renters, otherwise it could fuck over almost everybody. Banning plastic bags is ok too. And massive fines for littering.. sure, why not! Though some sort of course and public service would be better IMO, like we do for drivers who speed.

And yes, the UK is more relevant to the world than Japan or Germany or Brazil. And we are likely to remain that way, overtaking Germany in economic terms within 15 years. We have a permanent seat on the UNSC which they don't. We are a bigger member of NATO too. And if war did happen, I'd rather than the UK could defend itself rather than rely on the rest of NATO who, aside from the Americans, are lazy bastards who don't contribute enough to their militaries. Russia is at best a moderate regional power. They're large but have an economy equivalent to Italy. But nobody gives a fuck about Italy. So why do we care about Russia? Because they have nuclear weapons. They can never be irrelevant. If Italy or some other country pulled half the shit Russia did, they wouldn't be able to get away with it like Russia is. Their weapons at least buy them a seat at the debating table and a healthy amount of fear. The UK, as a stable democratic country with a responsible government would be absolutely insane to give up our nuclear abilities.

I also disagree with the idea about undergrad degrees. The loans system right now is pretty fair. If you do engineering and get a great job then you pay back the cost of your degree. After all, it was clearly worth getting. However, studying art, history, English etc DOES have some value. They are interesting subjects and there's nothing wrong with studying them. I believe we would be worse off if we stopped studying those things. But if they don't always lead to highly paid employment, the loan is repaid at a much lower rate, or not paid back at all. You can't say fairer than that. Making people pay £30k a year for a history degree is fucking insane and I can't believe this subreddit is so strongly supporting this bollocks. 

I also can't believe this subreddit agrees with tripling the congestion charge. So now only the very, very wealthiest can access London. If this wasn't dressed up as a ""leftie"" policy, or it was proposed by Boris, everybody would claim it was some sort of economic cleansing. 

Compulsory voting is silly though. Forcing somebody to do something doesn't make people more engaged at all. 

PMs getting one term also seems insane. I don't think they'd ever get anything done unless we also extended the term. Can you imagine changing leader every 4-5 years, with one guy undoing the work of the last guy. And the parties would be super pre-occupied with leadership struggles too, rather than uniting under one guy. It would cause chaos imo.

Also, why does British education need ""sorting""? Our primary/secondary schools are 2nd in Europe after Finland. 6th in the world in the ""rankings"", only behind the Asian countries with 12hr school days, cram schools, private tutors and other insane things. And our universities 2nd in the world after the US, far far ahead of anybody else in Europe. Even ""normal"" Unis like Manchester, Birmingham etc rank very well and are respected internationally.

The taxi driver took them to the hotel, where the applicant had booked and paid for a room in McDonald's name. During the taxi journey McDonald sent a text message to the applicant telling him that he had ""got a bird"" or words to that effect.

The night porter described her as ""extremely drunk"". That reinforced the Crown's case based on the evidence of witnesses and the CCTV footage before she had arrived at the hotel. While en route to the room the porter heard her say to McDonald ""You're not going to leave me, are you?"" They entered a bedroom in which various sexual acts took place and eventually they had sexual intercourse.

&gt; In the meantime, no doubt in answer to the message that he had received from McDonald, the applicant arrived at the same hotel with two other male friends. He persuaded the night porter to give him a key card to the room occupied by McDonald and the complainant. He said that he had booked the room for a friend who no longer needed it. The applicant entered the room. Sexual intercourse between McDonald and the complainant ceased. The applicant performed oral sex on the complainant and then had vaginal sex with her. While it was taking place the porter went to check what was happening. He waited outside the room for a while and concluded from the noises that he could hear within the room that a couple were having sexual intercourse. No other concerns were raised in his mind.

&gt; After about half an hour McDonald left the hotel via the reception. He had a brief word with the night porter, telling him that he should look out for the girl in room 14 (the room in question) because she was sick. The applicant did not leave by the front door; he went out by an emergency exit. McDonald and the applicant met up outside and they returned to the applicant's home.

&gt; The complainant said that her next memory was waking up in the hotel room at about 11.30am. She realised that she was alone. She was naked and had urinated in the bed. She had a headache and was confused. She reported the matter to the police.

&gt; The applicant was interviewed. He agreed that he had had both oral and vaginal sex with the complainant. His case was that she had consented. This was the case he advanced at trial.

&gt; He admitted that he had lied to the night porter to obtain a key card. He did so because he was aware of the policy in the hotel about multiple occupation of rooms and thought he might be denied entry. When he arrived at the room it was immediately apparent to him that McDonald and the complainant were engaged in enthusiastic consensual sex. When she was asked if the applicant could join in, the complainant clearly replied ""Yes"". McDonald stopped. The complainant asked the applicant to perform oral sex on her. He did so and then they had sexual intercourse. Throughout all the activities with him she was enthusiastic, wide awake and she consented to everything that happened.

&gt; The expert called by the defence calculated that the complainant's likely blood-alcohol level at about 4am would have approximated to something like 2½ times the legal driving limit. He gave evidence that she would have suffered from slurred speech and unsteadiness of gait, but he would not have expected any memory loss. It was an essential part of his expert evidence that there were significant doubts about the claim made by the complainant that she had suffered a memory loss. In effect, it was suggested that her assertion was false.

&gt; This was a classic case for decision by the jury. Having deliberated following the judge's directions on the law and his summing up of the evidence, they reached the verdicts we have indicated: **not guilty in the case of McDonald; guilty in the case of the applicant.**

Furthermore it suggests the active royal brand draws in tourism, whereas the historical royal brand from France next door is making a statistical mockery of such a suggestion.

Pertwee came in after two very unique Doctors: the grumpy old philosopher and the clownish schemer. Pertwee's Doctor had to be a seperate entity, and so carved himself out as the ""Doctor of action"", the Dandy who fenced. Now I really don't see that all that much in Capaldi. He's not a man of action, or at the very least, I don't see *him* fencing anytime soon. Not that he's passive like, say, Hamlet but he isn't that daring man in a cape. 

I see Capaldi as a mix between Hartnell and T.Baker, personally. First you've got the grumbling old man who's just as silly underneath as the rest... But... Capaldi feels a lot more... Innocent. It's hard to say, but it really feels like he's finally gotten over the persecution complex from the Time War that drove so much of 10 and, in a different way, 11. He's the first Doctor I can see going on random adventures for years just like T.Baker's era, and is trying to combine both the freshness of Hartnell's era with the lack-of-established-storylines of the Hinchcliffe era. 

Honestly it's still too soon to tell with Capaldi. He needs a Killing Joke moment, something that could potentially *break* him if he doesn't deal with it properly. Tennant got it with ""Knock four times"", and 11 had it with Trenzalore (especially that scene in NotD ""When you're a time traveller, there is one place where you must never, EVER go..""). Capaldi kinda got that in Dark Water with Missy trying to break him to use Cybermen for good (kinda a ""Gandalf use the ring for good"" question) but a lot of that episode was so belly-up that it didn't come across too well save for a speech or two between the two. I'd say we'll find out exactly his characterization once he finds Gallifrey. Till then, he has elements of Pertwee, Hartnell and T.Baker in him (like how Smith had Troughtan and McCoy in him, or Tennant had Davison) but not enough to say they're the exact same IMO.

Crown lands are owned by the Monarch by right of their position, not privately by the individual who happens to be the Monarch. 

The way feudalism worked is that one king would often kick another off the throne and take their kingdom, not their private stuff. If we kicked the monarch off the throne and changed their kingdom into a republic, we'd damn well have the right to the property of the monarchy as a republic.

null,false,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"Fine pick literally any other crime. Letting your dog shit on the street,  speeding, fly tipping, vandalism. Literally any law we have is broken on a daily basis. 

Let's take speeding for example. By your logic,  an act that isn't inherently ""unethical""  or ""immoral""  (let's just assume we agree on these definitions for now) is simply banned as a matter of pragmatism. 

So why don't we legalise speeding? In an ideal world people would always drive at safe speeds, so on a busy road it would be 30mph or less, and at night on an empty motorway you could go much faster than 70. I mean so far the ban on speeding has been just as ineffective or even more ineffective than the ban on drugs. 

Now you could of course tell me that the reason  speeding is banned is because you're not just a danger to yourself, but also to others. While that is true in some circumstances, it doesn't explain why you're legally not allowed to drive 100mph down an empty motorway when it's only you on it. 

Secondly, drug abuse can have harmful effects beyond the person simply using the drugs. If we are saying there is nothing inherently immoral with drug use or going fast in a car, it's just about moderation, why do we care about the guy accidentally running someone over but not about the guy OD-ing and leaving his family without a means of support and homeless. Or even simple the mental trauma done to a girl who comes home and sees daddy sitting in the bathtub with a needle in his arm. 

The argument that a law doesn't stop an activity taking place and therefore it should be revoked is dumb as fuck and not a single person who I've ever spoke to about legalisation of drugs would ever apply the same logic to any other law out there. 

Also you assume that we share the opinion that in an ideal world people would all use drugs in moderation. I disagree,  I think  in an ideal world you wouldn't need a ban as people wouldn't seek to relax or escape their lives via drug use, as everyone would leave healthy and fulfilling lives without all the stress etc that can drive people to drug use.

&gt;

&gt;__The Wombles__ are fictional pointy-nosed, furry creatures that live in burrows, where they aim to help the environment by collecting and recycling rubbish in creative ways. Wombles were created by author [Elisabeth Beresford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Beresford), and originally appeared in a series of children's novels from 1968.  Although Wombles supposedly live in every country in the world, Beresford's stories are concerned with the lives of the inhabitants of the burrow on [Wimbledon Common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Common) in London, [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England).

&gt;The characters gained a higher national profile in the UK in the mid-1970s as a result of a [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) commissioned children's television show which used [stop motion animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion_animation). A number of spin-off novelty songs also became hits in the British music charts. [The Wombles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wombles_(band\)) pop group was the idea of British singer and composer [Mike Batt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Batt).

&gt;The Womble motto is ""Make Good Use of Bad Rubbish"". This [environmentally friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism) message was a reflection of the growing environmental movement of the 1970s.

When you get caught up with watching all of the New Doctors, check out the Classic Doctors. These shows are from before the days of CGI, and sometimes have campy monsters and occasionally have wobbly sets. You’ll get more history of, and insight into the Doctors, and see themes and nods that appear in the New Doctors’ episodes.

Put “best shows of Classic Who” “Classic Doctor Who” “guide to Classic Who” “Classic Who watch list” or something similar in the search box for various posters’ lists of the best episodes for each of the Classic Doctors. Look for links to lists or you can go the FAQ and look for links to posted lists. Look on /r/doctorwho and /r/gallifrey.

And once you get through all of those, there are the DW audio dramas by Big Finish.

&gt;

&gt;__The Wombles__ are fictional pointy-nosed, furry creatures that live in burrows, where they aim to help the environment by collecting and recycling rubbish in creative ways. Wombles were created by author [Elisabeth Beresford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Beresford), and originally appeared in a series of children's novels from 1968.  Although Wombles supposedly live in every country in the world, Beresford's stories are concerned with the lives of the inhabitants of the burrow on [Wimbledon Common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Common) in London, [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England).

&gt;The characters gained a higher national profile in the UK in the mid-1970s as a result of a [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) commissioned children's television show which used [stop motion animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion_animation). A number of spin-off novelty songs also became hits in the British music charts. [The Wombles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wombles_(band\)) pop group was the idea of British singer and composer [Mike Batt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Batt).

&gt;The Womble motto is ""Make Good Use of Bad Rubbish"". This [environmentally friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism) message was a reflection of the growing environmental movement of the 1970s.

I'm saying this coming off of ""Kill the Moon"" and ""Mummy on the Orient Express"", and Clara's little fits are really annoying me. I feel like they should realize that by now, Clara as a character recognizes the implications behind decisions the doctor makes. Her character's not an imbecile. We don't need a rehash of ye olde ""questioning the doctor's motives"" with her because of all she's been through with him. Besides, I'm having a hard time seeing how he's made many super questionable decisions in this season. 

The writing on these has felt jumpy and is really pissing me off, to the point where I was feeling good and comfortable (after only two ish episodes) with the idea that [(Series 8, Episodes 7,8 spoilers? - I don't think this is necessary to mark as a spoiler, but I'll do it anyway)](#s ""Clara would be leaving the doctor."") I obviously need to finish the season up, but I hope that Clara's character gets better developed than love/romantic/doctor conflicts. I was done with that plot development after Martha (didn't much mind it with Amy, because they moved on fast enough, and the doctor felt more involved when they did use it, which helped it feel less shallow).

I was also super excited about having a doctor Donna, so that's probably part of why I agree with you as well. It would have been quite an interesting route to follow and use (the whole River regeneration thing didn't take it quite far enough for me).

It's thinking small. By no objective measure at all is the UK broken. By and large, it is a great county to live in. People think small and do not think action is warranted unless they first think things have gone to absolute shit before hand. It's ridiculous. Saying ""how to make the UK better"" doesn't warrant nearly the same reaction. The reality is that *is* what the author proposes. Making the UK better. It isn't an either/or proposition, it's not either working great or it's broken, it's an iterative process. It's the cumulative work of millions of people stretching back hundreds or thousands of years.  

Those supposed nonsense degrees are part of that process. A huge part. How do you understand this process without understanding history? Culture? Religion? Literature? Art? The social sciences? In many ways, these things are what distinguishes Britain from the rest of the world. The immense role Britain has played in advancing and preserving human knowledge cannot be overstated. It should be a point of pride. The most famous British scientists were not educated in the fields they are known for, they *created* them. An interest in stars led to the development and advancement of mathematics. Interest in the Bible, history, and legend led to the revival of lost civilizations such as Egypt and Assyria. Interest in philosophy led to the theoretical foundations of the modern state and economies. Programming is done in languages, not formula. Knowledge is not advanced in isolation. If you think these fields are worthless, you are thinking small. They are all contributing to making the UK better.

I'm glad you raised this point, as its been raised in the House of Commons before. So I'll quote the response it got by the very wise words of Jacob Rees-Mogg:

*""It becomes immeasurably confusing when you try to divide her majesty up in this way. Her Majesty is our sovereign full stop, that she is one person indivisible.... she's not the Trinity""*

**[Here is the video to back it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anb7BKIujtI)**. Cut to 5:21 for that part. 

The point is that The Crown, as an entity **does** privately own the crown estates. 

The first part of that same video goes some way to addressing your other point about inheritance tax. Obviously the implication being that the inheritance tax bill on one of the most expensive estates in the world couldn't be paid (even with the wealth they have) so they'd be forced to sell assets or the estates themselves. They go so far as to point out that the monarch surrenders **at the start of each reign** the Crown Estates to the government in exchange for the Sovereign Grant. So she surrenders over £200 million of income per year in exchange for about £30 million back. So in effect she is paying a tax rate of 85%... rather more than you or I. 

I just can't understand why people like you would have us destitute our own head of state for daring to work to age 88, 28 years after the retirement age, for doing nothing but her job - representing the UK, flawlessly, her entire life. It's utterly pathetic. And just to satisfy some false notion that the world has to be ""fair"" to within a tick box... when the world clearly isn't fair.

The Monarch, at the start of each new reign, since George III has surrendered **voluntarily** that income to the government in exchange for a lump grant (now known as the Sovereign Grant) which is significantly smaller. There is no legal commitment for them to do it. Prince Charles would for example be entirely within his rights to not surrender it when he becomes King.  

The Tourism point I agree is a weak argument since we'll never know to what extent monarchy plays into the minds of tourists complex decision making process - other than to know anecdotally that they like it on the whole. HOWEVER, the video itself points out the weakness of this argument and already makes the case that before considering that the Sovereign Grant is still much lower than the money rightfully made by them.

The rules essentially say that:

1. A company must meet certain conditions in order to apply to be registered to advertise jobs outside the EU
1. If they are accepted for registration they can offer jobs to people outside the EU, but only once they can prove that they have advertised the job throughout the entire EU and they haven't found a suitable candidate. 
1. There are only a limited number of visas the companies can apply for each year.

Your best bet is to marry your partner, which will place visa restrictions on you both when you move over (your partner must be able to demonstrate a certain income level and/or savings to support you as you wouldn't be allowed to work for a while (iirc).).

Obviously this would be a big step and life choice.

Given the writers instances that the show wouldn't become a sort of perpetual 'bodies on the beach' type programme, re-opening the events surrounding the Sandbrook investigation seemed like the logical route; particularly so as to keep Tennants' character involved.

The murder of Danny Latimer in the first series was the catalyst for a whole closets worth of secrets and revelations - pretty much no one given any degree of prominence emerged unscathed. Given the character play within the first episode, it's looking like that'll be the case over the course of series two.

I'm not sure if they were promoted / mentioned after the episode [I watched via ITV Player, after the event] but in conjunction with each episode, there's a short story eBook being released, centred around one character.

Told from a first person perspective, it details how she came to be in the position she's in as the show re-opens - both in terms of the devastation to her personal life, and her professional one [the episode led me to believe she'd been demoted; the eBook corrects this].

Think of them as, deleted scenes - little snippets of information that whilst perhaps [you never know!] not vital to the central story, help pad out the characters backgrounds.

Each one costs .99 - I'm not sure if £7.92 represents good value, for what'll effectively end up as a ~160 page story, but given that it'll be full of information not included in the TV series, I'm prepared to continue buying 'em.",null,0,null,1420534879,null,0,1420535150,0,cng0y50,null,t3_2rg0t6,null,t1_cng0y50,null,t3_2rg0t6,null,null,null,1425032712,null,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2,null

* If you look at the credits for the MCFC website on Sitecore (the CMS we're using), you can clearly see that we're credited to have built the website http://www.sitecore.net/Customers/Entertainment/Manchester-City-FC.aspx

He is a cliché spouting populist, a left-wing Farage, who mocks anyone who challenges his arguments and deflects any criticism with jokes. 

In his book he was a line which sums his quality of argument up: ""The economy isn't real, that's why it's got the word 'con' in it"". That's obviously a single line but it points towards his tendency to substitute a good line in favour of a well-thought out argument. 

Another example would be the revolution line he was peddling and again he had little thought behind the populist line. It's quite a attention-grabbing idea and he got a lot of press for it. However he never expanded on it and when challenged by a [fairly mild article from Robert Webb](http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/russell-brand-robert-webb-choosing-vote-most-british-kind-revolution-there) he responded in [characteristic fashion by invoking Webb's educational background and saying he is 'against death camps'](http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/nov/05/russell-brand-robert-webb-revolution). He didn't engage in the arguments and it wasn't Webb's point that Brand was a Nazi, it's was Webb's point that revolutions tend to be violent irrespective of any 'good intentions' from those who started. Of Course Brand didn't think of the meaning of revolution when he said it, it was just a cool thing to say, so it figures that he is unable to muster even a basic coherent defence of it. 

The problem with Brand is not that he doesn't have the answers, it's that his arguments are superficial. He won't engage in a proper debate. He prefers populism over debate and cliché over depth.

I agree entirely that it's overpriced and unnecessary - I could have waited a day or 2 in both instances, and probably saved at least 20% of the total costs. But if something needs doing, and I'm in the zone doing it, I don't mind paying a little bit extra to get it finish sooner.

Ultimately, I use Maplin for Shutl though. If another, cheaper, electronics retailer used Shutl, I'd go with them instead.

edit: the other end of the spectrum in terms of cost and delivery is aliexpress. Typically I try to order my electronics from there, if I can wait a few weeks for delivery.",null,0,null,1420536674,null,0,1420550173,0,cng1c51,null,t3_2rf13r,null,t1_cng1c51,null,t3_2rf13r,null,null,null,1425032460,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

An interesting fact about white people is that they firmly believe that all of the world’s problems can be solved through “awareness.”  Meaning the process of making other people aware of problems, and then magically someone else like the government will fix it.

This belief allows them to feel that sweet self-satisfaction without actually having to solve anything or face any difficult challenges.  Because, the only challenge of raising awareness is people not being aware.  In a worst case scenario, if you fail someone doesn’t know about the problem.  End of story.

What makes this even more appealing for white people is that you can raise “awareness” through expensive dinners, parties, marathons, selling t-shirts, fashion shows, concerts, eating at restaurants and bracelets.  In other words, white people just have to keep doing stuff they like, EXCEPT now they can feel better about making a difference.

Raising awareness is also awesome because once you raise awareness to an acceptable, arbitrary level, you can just back off and say “Bam! did my part.  Now it’s your turn.  Fix it.”

So to summarise – you get all the benefits of helping (self satisfaction, telling other people) but no need for difficult decisions or the ensuing criticism (how do you criticise awareness?).  Once again, white people find a way to score that sweet double victory.

Popular things to be aware of: The Environment, Diseases like Cancer and AIDS, Africa, Homophobia, Inequality, Ebola, and political prisoners.

HOWEVER, there is some light at the end of the tunnel for our generation. For one, there are still decent paying jobs out there, and they're not that hard to obtain. You can train as a gas engineer in a year, and that's a job that pays £300/day. In fact all of the trades still pay well. There are an absolute shitload of jobs in IT out there too, and because we've used computers our whole lives we're inherently better at them than our parents.

Also, we can hope that because of technological advances, stuff will continue to get cheaper in the future, making us able to live well with less money. By the time we're decrepit, hopefully we can have a robot wipe our arse and cook for us for very little money.

&gt;__The Wombles__ are fictional pointy-nosed, furry creatures that live in burrows, where they aim to help the environment by collecting and recycling rubbish in creative ways. Wombles were created by author [Elisabeth Beresford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Beresford), and originally appeared in a series of children's novels from 1968.  Although Wombles supposedly live in every country in the world, Beresford's stories are concerned with the lives of the inhabitants of the burrow on [Wimbledon Common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Common) in London, [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England).

&gt;The characters gained a higher national profile in the UK in the mid-1970s as a result of a [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) commissioned children's television show which used [stop motion animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion_animation). A number of spin-off novelty songs also became hits in the British music charts. [The Wombles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wombles_(band\)) pop group was the idea of British singer and composer [Mike Batt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Batt).

&gt;The Womble motto is ""Make Good Use of Bad Rubbish"". This [environmentally friendly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism) message was a reflection of the growing environmental movement of the 1970s.

 &gt; “Ten years ago I also had a very difficult decision to make when we had [Carlo] Cudicini giving fantastic performances in Chelsea’s goal for many years.

&gt;“But Petr is an amazing goalkeeper and the difference between them is 10 years, and we have to think about the future of the club and I made the decision to give the goal to Courtois.

- Mourinho right before the Burnley season opener.

It's true that Mourinho will pick the best team, but it's clear he picked Courtois because of age. That doesn't suddenly mean he'll always pick the youngest player though as you're implying. He doesn't pick Zouma because he isn't better than Terry and is nowhere near the same leader as Terry at this age. Willian over Schurrle is based on form and Willian over Salah is based on talent gap. The Remy situation kind of has everybody confused because Remy's played better in his limited minutes while Drogba always seems to be the second choice at getting minutes/rotation starts. 

He has picked Courtois solely because of his age because they're very similar talent-wise. Courtois has grown so much faster than anybody expected and Mourinho knows he can't afford to give up the future for the present/past:

&gt; 'If Petr [Cech] plays [Thibaut] Courtois can think about leaving, or visa versa,' Mourinho added.

He very may likely prefer Courtois over Cech despite the age, but saying it's not mainly due to age is kind of silly. He knows by playing Cech, Courtois could easily leave to become the first choice keeper for every club in the world except Bayern and maybe United.

I'm fine with being charged a few pence for a plastic bag put removing them altogether would seriously hinder shopping for a lot of people.             
Think £1 and 99p stores, market traders, etc.                 
With the littering I like the idea, but who is going to enforce this? The police and councils are stretched as it is.                
                   
3. Council tax based on house value would be a terrible idea. Tax on the services provided to the house in question.              
For example someone living in a city/large town gets more services then someone living in the countryside.                   
                      
4. Rise pension age to 70, another dumb idea.                
Higher retirement age means more elderly workers which means less jobs for younger people, which is part of the reason the pensions are in so much trouble.                  
                      
6. Like 3. this article is aimed at people who live and work in cities or large towns. While the public transport and train sectors need a serious overhaul, removing usage or increasing the taxation on cars would cripple people living and/or working in rural areas.                           
                      
10. There is plenty of land (brown sites) and property which can be used for housing its just cheaper, easier and more desirable to build new. This needs to stop.                   
Make it a requirement that there is no disused properties or non greenbelt land before they can consider building new.                
A local mill town near me has dozens of unused mills, factories and houses in disrepair which could (a few have been converted) easily be converted into a hundred or so houses/flats/apartments yet they are building on greenbelt.                 
Stoke on Trent and Liverpool have the right idea, but more towns/cities need to do this as a first resort as opposed to last.

Not sure which 'latest surveys' Theresa May's getting her figures from, but it's not [HESA](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/stats):  
  
Total non-UK domicile students:  
2008/09   - [368970](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/sfr197)  
2009/10   - [405805](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/pr172)  
2010/11   - [428225](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/pr184)  
2011/12   - [435235](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/stats)  
2012/13   - [425265](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/stats)  
  
&gt; and that by the 2020s we will see 600,000 overseas students each year in this country  
  
    
Not sure how that calculation's been made.  
  
  
Take the HESA figures (above) and assume that the greatest rate of historic increase will continue.  
The greatest historic increase was from 2008/09 to 2009/10, i.e. from 368970 to 405805 (an overall increase of 36835 students).  
If we add this figure (i.e. 36835) to the previous year's total every year from 2012/13 to 2020/21 we get projected figures of:  
  
  
2013/14 - 462100  
2014/15 - 478666  
2015/16 - 495233  
2016/17 - 511799  
2017/18 - 528365  
2018/19 - 544931  
2019/20 - 561498  
2020/21 - 578064  
  
  
Which isn't 600,000.  
  
  
But then if we assume the minimum rate of increase (2011/12 - 2012/13 - a decrease of -9970) and do the same we end up with projected figures of:  
  
  
2013/14 - 415295  
2014/15 - 405325  
2015/16 - 395355  
2016/17 - 385385  
2017/18 - 375415  
2018/19 - 365445  
2019/20 - 355475  
2020/21 - 345505  
  
  
So by 2020 we'll have somewhere between 345505 and 578064 p/a.  
  
    
Having said that neither of these assumptions seems particularly sensible. Looking at the historic figures the maximum growth rate didn't persist - in fact (for 2012/13 at least) the overseas student populate shrank.  
A slightly more sensible suggestion might be to take the average between 2012/13 and 2008/09 (662) and do the same as before:  
  
  
2013/14 - 425927  
2014/15 - 426590  
2015/16 - 427252  
2016/17 - 427914  
2017/18 - 428576  
2018/19 - 429239  
2019/20 - 429901  
2020/21 - 430563  
  
  
Of course all of these projections rely on the assumption that things will stay more-or-less the same.  
Which, I suppose, is my point. Things don't tend to stay the same and 7-year projections are like month-ahead weather forecasts - extremely unreliable, open to a great deal of variation and therefore to be treated with a very large pinch of salt.

Personally, I've nothing against people voting, but I think people are fools if they believe any sort of real systemic change comes from it.  Every major change that has bettered the life of working people and shifted the balance of power in their favour, although they may have been voted for in parliament, has come from grassroots organised extra-parliamentary pressure.  It's such pressure which pretty much shapes what gets onto the agenda, and without such pressure the agenda is driven by those with the wealth to influence what appears in the media, who gets selected for office and what interests they will represent.    [This is an American paper](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9354310), but I'd give odds it'd be more than replicated in the UK, and it shows that ordinary people have little to no influence on policy through the normal ""democratic"" process.

So, am I arguing we shouldn't vote?  Not at all, if you do nothing else political at all, then go for it, vote your heart out.  But if you want to influence politics and policy and change society, get active and involved in other ways as well as or instead of that and you'll be guaranteed to give yourself - as well as us collectively - a much bigger voice.",null,0,null,1420541006,null,0,false,0,cng26t5,null,t3_2ri324,null,t1_cng26t5,null,t3_2ri324,null,null,null,1425032063,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

Flats are available that can suit a range of needs (fancier flats around Westgate, more economical flats around Hales Place). Its really not a cheap place to live, but if students can manage I'm sure a professional can survive.

Here are some tips to appreciating 11:

1) Acknowledge that he is older, wiser, and more burdened than 10.  It's hard to see this past his baby face.  The reason why he never revisits any old characters or references old enemies is because he chooses to leave them.  Realize that none of 10's followers had the choice to stay or leave when they wanted (except for Martha).  This incarnation marks a new chapter in the doctor's life.

2) Appreciate Matt Smith's persona.  Even though 10 was by far the most emotional doctor, 11 is the most versatile.  He's the only doctor where you can see his lightheartedness in one scene and then in the next scene see centuries and centuries of age and burden and loss in his eyes.  He's the only doctor that acts both his apparent age (mid 20s baby faced man) and his true age (900ish) at the same time.

3) I personally thought that he was the best monologuer.  The way he delivers his lines just defines the doctor sometimes.  Just wait til you get to the pandorica episode.

Then be prepared to cry buckets because his regeneration scene was simply beautiful.

I'll probably be downvoted because a lot of people here don't like Matt Smith.  Whatever.  To each their own.  Also, this subreddit's userbase is pretty finicky sometimes so if you want a more casual doctor who subreddit, I urge you to check out /r/DoctorWhumour.

The 1967 Act was introduced because there was no legal way for a woman to terminate her pregnancy, even if the foetus was not viable and it presented a serious threat to the health and wellbeing of the mother if she were to continue with carriage until her due date.

The Act may have been a Private Member's Bill, but that was because it was so (and still is) controversial. This meant the government could support it indirectly, and did so by appointing the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to chair the medical advisory committee.

Out of curiosity, why are you against aligning the legality of abortion here in Northern Ireland with the rest of the United Kingdom? We share a National Health Service, and yet previous Health Minister Edwin Poots stated that he would seek prosecution of anyone from here who flew to mainland UK to seek an abortion for legitimate reasons. Current Health Minister Jim Wells is just as stubborn on the issue, and would hold that abortion be illegal in *all* circumstances, including rape.

I'm not sure if you can see the various 'mysteries' on offer without having an account, but there are three available at the moment:

* Some sort of Time Travel one wherein the recipient starts off by receiving a Will dated in the future (I think).

* The recipient gets sent classified documents pertaining to some sort of covered up outbreak in Russia.

* The recipient is sent notes and pages from a banned play. I think it's suggested that the play is a bit creepy?

All of the stories conclude in a satisfying way apparently. In fact, the last thing you receive is always something substantial. For example; http://imgur.com/rIJdWdj - seems really cool. The cost is somewhat high (~£120), so it's definitely a present for a special occasion/person. You can actual custom make a mystery with the help of the site's 'Curator', as they put it.

When used and disposed in the correct manner plastic bags are much, much better for the environment then paper.                  
Reusables are good if they are the right type and like plastic bags are used and disposed of correctly. The trouble is a lot of the reusable bags aren't recyclable, take longer to decompose then standard plastic bags and take up far more land fill space. Not to mention the additional resources and energy to make the in the first place means they must be used x under of times to over come the impact vs plastic bags.               
Right now the infrastructure and alternatives aren't in place to completely remove plastic bags. Reusable bags need to be stronger, lighter and more compact while still being recyclable, trolleys need to have a reusable bag holder or similar, they need to be silver lined or similar to cut health risks and they need promoting.               
There are some great products out there, but they are hard to get like the shopping trolley to boot bags/boxes (I've been after a set for a while, but can find them online or in any stores).                   
This is why I said charge for them, but don't remove them. I reuse plastic bags be it for taking lunch to work (in a pinch/hurry), back up dog poop bag or simply to light the wood burners. So a few pence for something that's practical or if someone forgets there reusable bags is more then reasonable and gives everyone the nudge is far better then simply banning or removing them.

The same people will then loudly complain about lack of workers rights, low pay, rent controls, bankers bonuses, job insecurity, tax avoidance, etc. Well, what do you expect when what should be the main block of opposition have all been subdivided into scattered into various groups that only further their own specific groups interest?

I was in a pub in Swansea watching the game. It was a nice day and I'd gone shopping in the morning beforehand, so I wore my Everton shirt. Got to represent and all that (even though we'd literally only just lost to Swansea at Swansea I thought fuck it why not). Any way, I take the piss shopping as always and kick off is in like 5 minutes, so I race to a pub I knew had the game on. Walk in as the game kicks off and it's just a sea of red shirts. There wasn't a single blue in the place. The game has started and I can't walk out and find another pub so I buy a drink and sit down at the only empty table I can find. 

For the next 90 minutes I received every kind of verbal abuse imaginable from the Liverpool fans. It started out as banter I think but they got carried away. I just sort of took it because I was extremely outnumbered and I actually felt really shitty and angry, because can't a girl watch the game in peace???

So when Jagielka scored in the 90th minute with an aweeeeesomeee goal, it felt like the best thing ever right then. I was on my feet cheering and said something dumb like ""ha that shut you up didn't it, wankers"". It was brilliant, they all sat there with dumbstruck faces.

Be warned that a few pubs only allow season ticket holders and/or home team match day ticket holders to enter. The Clifton Arms (which is right next to the stadium) is season ticket holders only after noon (or something like that), but it doesn't really have a ""great"" atmosphere. As far as I can remember, The Portmanor and The Duke of Cambridge would give you the best atmosphere, but I recall the Holmesdale Fanatics being forced to relocate from the former pub and I don't know where they've settled in now.

There aren't many great food joints near the stadium - it's all takeaways. But if a takeaway is what you want, there are a few by the Family Stand end. The food in the stadium is pretty dire.

And an aside: try to get to the gates about half an hour before kick-off at the latest, as they get a bit clogged up after this.

Out of curiosity, have you been to Selhurst park before? What stand are you in and what station are you using?

Also, you have broken it to your brother-in-law that Jedi won't be playing?

Also legalisation is just a part of it... if you check my post I do **not** mention legalisation... only a change in the current law. Decriminalisation is another option. As are a whole host of solutions.

Back to the main point though... everyone has an agenda, that's not the issue here. The issue is presenting AskFrank as factual and unbias when it is in fact bias and only telling half the facts (as I evidenced).

If someone wants to take offence in that manner, they're using an excuse, not a justification - just as they would be if they took my saying the word 'black' out of context.

&gt;I'm sorry but that's just some really poor reasoning.

No, it's non-racist reasoning. There's a difference.

&gt;You could say that calling a black person negro shouldn't be offensive because it's just the spanish word for black

And a while back, black people got upset with 'black', so everyone started using 'coloured'. Then they got upset with 'coloured', and we went back to 'black'. You've provided a good example, though - is the word Negro banned in Spain or UK? No, because it has more than one meaning. Abusive slang words like Nigger and such - yes, because they can only have one meaning...but once we start insisting that multiple-use words can *only* be racist, you're creating a minefield - note how these discussions usually revolve around 'ooo that person said a bad word' followed by a refusal to acknowledge any other kind of interpretation as valid; it's that kind of thinking that had Brent Council (I think it was) insisting on 'Baa Baa Green Sheep'.

&gt;You're also ignoring the history of the word.

No, I'm ignoring the racism - which is what lots of people do. You can only really get upset about 'Paki Shop' by ignoring the *context*, rather than history - and once we're into that territory, you could say 'I just heard that guy say Negro' without adding on the caveat that they're Spanish or discussing a bottle of Cordon Negro.

True but posting Cannabis is pretty common these days. Smell proof bags are cheap and easy to use.

And even so, if it gets intercepted so what? They can't trace it back to the source... and they'd know from the address it's going to a drug testing place.

Well I was thinking they would test the potency or for any pollutant (although I know this is basically non-existent with weed).

Sure, except that these friends actually set the bar at the level of offensiveness they were comfortable with. It's actually *more* than I was used to. Jokes about suicide bombing from my Pakistani friend? I would never go there with a stranger - but *he* was comfortable with it.

Depends on the term and manner of use - you know what? I probably would temper my language because I'm not an arsehole and can just as easily say Chinese Takeaway as Chinky. 

However - and this bit's important: 

I don't do that because I am deeply aware that I'm being racist or rude. I do it so as not to make someone I don't know - who may be offended - uncomfortable.

There is no legal commitment for them to do it. Prince Charles would for example be entirely within his rights to not surrender it when he becomes King.

As you mention, the Monarch is within their right to refuse the sovereign grant arrangement. This just means *within the arrangement of our Monarchy* there is the option for the Monarch to gaffle all the profit and use it in some other way. Which kinda sucks for the subjects of said Monarchy. This doesn't mean the Monarch owns the land privately. 

The strawman position in the video suggests the Monarch would be within their right to take the crown land at the formation of a republic into their own private ownership, which is absurd royalist propaganda. 

&gt;the Sovereign Grant is still much lower than the money rightfully made by them.

Without an open court process, there would be no way to ensure the legal system was behaving. This is a cornerstone of the UK legal system - we don't have secret courts (well, we do have a few, when we want to shut up Guardian journalists).

Now, there are arguments against this for special cases (e.g. defendant is a minor). Is rape or sexual assault a special case then is the question. 

One argument could be, yes, an accusation of rape causes disproportionately more harm than say an accusation of theft. A counter argument could be that making rape a 'special case' undermines the prosecution before a case even begins.

&gt;You've provided a good example, though - is the word Negro banned in Spain or UK? No, because it has more than one meaning.

Firstly, it's not banned, same as any other offensive slur. Secondly, in Spanish, negro is the word for black, they do not have another word for negro. In English, we do have another word for negro, the one we have always had, black. Negro has never been used in English in the way Spanish people use it, we wouldn't go to a shop and ask for a negro jumper, or a negro car, we'd say black. Negro is almost always used in English speaking countries as a derogatory slur. How you fail to see this is beyond me.

I'm Chinese. I am very happy of the fact that I'm Chinese and I love to celebrate and share the traditions of my cultural heritage with everyone. I don't want people to pretend I'm not Chinese or ignore my heritage. I don't want to be ""just like a white person"". I just want people not to use my race as basis for assumptions, attacks or insults.

We can all acknowledge each others' races and each others' differences without being racist. We can celebrate them even by enjoying all the variety that our mix of races and cultures has to offer.

Referring to the word ""Chinky"", it's a word, and I don't think any word should be made illegal to think or say. I fully defend anyone's legal right to use it in any context, be it offensive or not. However, it cannot be denied that it is an offensive word to many people, just like ""fuck"" or ""cunt"". Objectively, it's just a sound you make with your mouth, but unfortunately, it carries a fair amount of baggage.

If you don't care about offending people, then that's fine, more power to you, say it to every Chinese person you see. But if you want to be polite, then it's quite a simple matter to just avoid using those words. It goes without saying, that if you are in a position in the public eye, it's not a good idea to be offending anyone, even if you don't mean to.

Just to be clear, I am talking about being polite versus being offensive, I am *not* talking about rights and laws. I am totally opposed to the police or government getting involved with regulating what people say, no matter how racist or offensive. Furthermore, laws and punishments should not be based on the race (or sex or sexual preferences etc) of the victim.

The military was a joke before then... yes, started to invest since then.. now at 4% GDP putting them towards the top, but not in real money terms (see previous link)

&gt; But the biggest reform was a ten-year weapons-modernisation programme launched in 2010, at a cost of $720 billion. The aim was to go from only 10% of kit classed as “modern” to 70% by 2020

read that over and over again.  That puts them at approx. 40-45% modern kit. Total.

&gt; the army will struggle to meet its target of a force that is 40% professional

&gt; Russia’s strategic nuclear forces, which absorb a third of the defence budget

This speaks volumes, given MAD that leaves a very low amount of spending on their Western Front (again China/Middle East to worry about)

&gt; Russian doctrine assumes that theatre nuclear missiles will compensate for inferior conventional forces.

again, proving my point

&gt; A big question is whether Russia can afford to devote a rising share of its GDP to the armed forces. The defence budget accounts for over 20% of all public spending.

If oil stays down they will cut spending *heavily*.  They simply will have no choice.  

I did listen and discuss.  Shared links even.  Your opinion of a 'strong' Russian army is categorically wrong.  Yes they can pick on weak neighbours, no they can not take on any other major country, never mind USA and NATO would crush them (but of course that could go nuclear so thankfully won't happen).

It always gets leaked, that's the point. It should be the law that they can't be named and shamed without a conviction. 

&gt;There was plenty of evidence in the Bill Roach case, it was a strong case with multiple witnesses. Mr. Roach had a better defence team though (the perks of money) and the CPS mishandled the case - several of the witnesses had no idea of the kind of hostile cross examination they were going to go through and got flustered on the stand.

If I said the Ched Evans case was spurious and only won because the jury was made up of idiots, I don't think people would be too happy. Either not guilty means not guilty and guilty means guilty or it doesn't. 

&gt;As is, police have guidance not to name suspects before charge. When someone is charged, regardless of the crime, it becomes a matter of public record because we do not generally hold trials in secret.

You can hold the trial openly whilst hiding the identity of the accused, much in the same way that the accuser is hidden throughout the process.

Messi isn't some European phenomenon that nobody has heard. He's a global sport presence, and a global football icon.

MLS has a salary cap, there is no chance he'd make anywhere near as much money at a U.S. football team. Even if Messi was playing gridiron he'd be making more in Europe (annual gross take-home, not guaranteed money).

Messi makes $21.2 million USD annually (base salary with FCB). 

With endorsements he makes $45 million USD in combined income.

Edit: I forgot to mention he's ranked as the worlds richest footballer by Forbes. So there's that.

Beckham, who is another type of global football titan, was still making less than Messi *while* he was with the MLS.

Endorsement deals with Messi are global. They're in Asia, they're in Europe, Oceania, and in the United States. Go into any Adidas store and Messi's face and gear will be there next to whatever boots Adidas is pushing this month. He was also in a series of Gillete commercials like last year with Federer - these aired in the United States.

There's more money in sport in the U.S. if you're playing Hockey, Basketball, or Gridiron Football. Playing those anywhere else in the world will earn you less and will give you less profile.

null,false,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,null,"&gt;You're talking about context a lot here

Someone has to, otherwise we're back to the days of the Oz trial.

&gt; but there is literally no context where paki is an acceptable word, none, zero. 

The fact that we're having this discussion disputes that - I'm far from alone in this view of the Paki Shop term, making your absolute a bit ignorant.

&gt;That word was practically coined by skinheads in the 70's who'd go ""Paki bashing"", beating people, smashing their businesses up and being a total bastard to anyone who wasn't white.

In the same way that those same skinheads would call Africans 'black bastards'. Doesn't mean describing someone as black makes one automatically racist.

&gt;Firstly, it's not banned, same as any other offensive slur.

I should have said 'discouraged' or similar. The point still stands.

&gt;Secondly, in Spanish, negro is the word for black, they do not have another word for negro.

Now you're ignoring the point.

&gt;In English, we do have another word for negro, the one we have always had, black. we wouldn't go to a shop and ask for a negro jumper, or a negro car, we'd say black.

Like Cordon Negro? Shall I find other examples? The point was to illustrate how one could use the word innocently and be accused as racist by someone that thinks context is irrelevant - like the first line of your last reply. I've already given you a context, several in fact - you haven't actually addressed that at all.

&gt;Negro is almost always used in English speaking countries as a derogatory slur.

Indeed, although I can't remember the last time I heard anyone use it as such, if ever. 'Nigger', yes, but not Negro.

&gt;How you fail to see this is beyond me.

How you've failed to see my quite detailed separation of the difference between addressing someone directly and describing food/ shops is beyond me.

&gt;So if I ignore the racism in the word kaffer I'd be fine walking the streets of Johannesburg saying it?

I wasn't aware that kaffer had another use.

&gt;Or I could walk the steets of New Orleans saying nigger at will because I'm ignoring the racism?

Now you're resorting to words that can *only* have one meaning to prove your point about, er, words that don't.

&gt;Or go over to California and start calling the Mexicans beaners because I totally ignore the racism in that term. 

Another new one on me. Is there a beaner-land? You don't seem to be separating 'racist terms' from 'terms that can be racist' very well.

&gt;Or would it be ok because the Mexican dude runs a restaurant and I can say ""I'm just going to the beaner restaurant"".

Do lots of people call them 'beaner restaurants'? Or more generally, why are you having to employ lots of slang terms of abuse in order to label someone's country of origin as the same?

&gt;Your logic has more holes than a sieve.

Really? I've been giving lots of examples as to how Paki Shop or Chinky can be innocently used, and you've replied with examples that *only* exist as racist slurs.

Nowhere do I state 'so any racist term is allowed'.

Nowhere do I state 'terms and racist labels are exactly the same and that's fine'.

Your logic is suffering by your apparent eagerness to herp-derp.

null,false,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,null,"In order to understand this it's necessary to know why racism is seen as bad in this country. It may not be for the reasons many people commonly think.

A century or more ago, racism was perfectly acceptable in this country. To some extent it was encouraged. It was necessary for running an empire. Ordinary working class British people needed to believe themselves to be superior to blacks and indians etc, so they wouldn't hesitate to administer a swift beating to keep the natives in line. Anyone who ""went native"" and adopted local customs was seen as deeply suspect.

There's also no a priori axiom saying ""racism is bad"". ""Thou shalt not be racist"" isn't a commandment from god. As a matter of fact, some parts of the bible are deeply racist (e.g. the jews being the ""chosen people"").

Things changed back in the 1950s when we started inviting many people here from far flung parts of the world to provide cheap labour for our factories. When these workers arrived, they were often met with hostility. Over the years, this caused problems, both regular minor incidents, and eventually, full scale riots.

The authorities, large employers, and large parts of the middle classes, saw this unrest as a serious problem, and responded in many ways. Some obvious, such as legislation, some more subtle, such as advertisers going out of their way to display racially integrated groups.

Racism became bad, because unrest in society is bad, and our society is trying to defend itself from unrest. If our society had remained less racially diverse, then it is very likely that racism would still be common and socially acceptable, as it is in many asian societies today (e.g. Japan, Korea).

That's why Chinese racism isn't seen as being as serious as racism against blacks or muslims - for the simple reason that Chinese people have never rioted in this country. Racism against Chinese isn't a serious threat to the peace, and so is treated as less serious by the UK police.

This also explains why, on football terraces, it is very easy to be arrested for mocking a players black ancestry, but homophobic insults are seen as fair game (because gays don't riot). 

Not all forms of prejudice are equal.

The variables included in our exclusive econometric model refer to player performances (matches, goals, dribbles, etc.), their characteristics (age, position, contract duration, etc.), as well as competition level and results achieved by their teams (clubs and national sides).

The NHS was first put into the minds of people by a socialist by the name of Dr Benjamin Moore who established the State Medical Service Association. 

By 1930 it had been renamed to the Socialist Health Association.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Health_Association

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_National_Health_Service_%28England%29

British people can thank all the communists and socialists for what came to be the NHS in 1948 after nearly 40 years of grassroots campaigning by the socialists inside the Labour party. And let's remember that Labour in 1930s/40s were pretty much full fledged socialists.

Similarly, the standardization of the 8 hour day (compared to 14-16 hour days wage slavery at the time) were won by grass roots socialists and communists.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day

The reality is - at the time the NHS was invented socialism/communism were spoken ideals with a lot of grass roots support amongst the common man. Now the standard view is that capitalism is the ""default"" state for humans which is why we're seeing a return to wealth inequality and attempts to privatise the NHS. Because at the time in 1948 - there was a significant amount of people in the country that didn't accept that capitalism (or, even it's more nefarious incarnation via Thatcher/Reagan, neo-liberal capitalism) was the default state for human beings and were willing to violently overthrow the government/bourgeois.

They waited decades with concessions (such as nationalised health services/a welfare stat/gas/railways/mail) until economic ideology was no longer being discussed amongst the working class before they began privatising industry/NHS. 

I think it's absolutely on point to say that the NHS was created off the back of a strong left wing (socialists/communists and trade unionists) holding a gun to the head of the governmen coupled with a togetherness from the horrors of WW2.

Yep, anyone can be racist. But that doesn't mean it should be acceptable behavior. Well, I think people ought to say whatever they please, because I believe in freedom of expression, but kindness is preferred to hatred, and aggressiveness.

Now, if people are wondering why words become racist, well it's because of the history behind it. Usually racial terms arise when foreigners visit other countries, and often times local people make the effort to isolate, and exclude them, and classify them as inferior; with that comes name calling, and the term chink is a part of this. This pretty much applies to anything. It's not the word itself. It's the meaning behind it, and what came with that. It's like the word nigger. That is what they used to call black people during slavery times.

In his recent book 'Revolution'. He points out that that although he of course doesn't have all the answers he can make a clear case that 

(1) the current situation is unacceptable and that either capitalism or our existence on this planet will have to be given up.

(2) those with a vested interest with keeping the status quo will not willingly give that up without a revolution 

(3) the hallmarks of a true revolution must be different to the tyranny they seek to overthrow (therefore love and peace and creativity and embracing nuance and humour) .

I found his book very insightful and well thought out. Although I didn't agree with everything I couldn't see how anyone reading it could disagree with his central premise of the urgency of change and that our current 'democratic' 2-party system were not going to deliver it. I also don't see how you could read it and doubt his integrity or authentic life-journey and the wisdom he shows having battled so many personal addictions.

To defend the points above he references:

For point one:  Thomas Picketty (respected economist) and James Goldsmith (successful capitalist). 
As well as facts like 6 waltons own more wealth than the bottom third of americans.
http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2011/12/14/six-waltons-have-more-wealth-than-the-bottom-30-of-americans/

For point two: Chomsky (manufacturing consent) and Eisenhower (military industrial complex) as well as how the real enemy that the state fears is not ruskies or arabs but *us* (the non-1%) even more obvious since recent revelations from Snowden etc.

For point three: He highlights the success of Mandela, King, Gandhi and the failure of violent revolutions in Russia and elsewhere. He makes the case that how we conduct the revolution is important in defining what comes next.

The problem is I have just spent 25 minutes in a point by point defence. You will have to slog through a large book or audio book to really get to his very well thought through arguments that include the importance of humanities mythological realities (Joseph Campbell mentioned many times), own personal exploration of our own darkness our fear and addictions, our need for practises and communities that support our well being in comm-union with each other and the importance of a connection to something bigger than ourselves in his case a belief in god.

He also suggests many idea that could be tried: technology can help create anarchic self-organising groups and direct voting (he references examples in Brazil and Switzerland). Corporations could be forced to hand a third of shares to employees as Sweden once considered.

Compare that to the easy self-satisfying put down that other lazy redditors can easily upvote and move on.

Consider your use of the word fanatics at the end. How thought through was that daming pejorative? How much effort are you really willing to invest in making the world a better place, how well do you think your endeavours compare to Brand?

&gt; In his recent book 'Revolution'. He points out that that although he of course doesn't have all the answers he can make a clear case that

&gt; (1) the current situation is unacceptable and that either capitalism or our existence on this planet will have to be given up.

&gt; (2) those with a vested interest with keeping the status quo will not willingly give that up without a revolution

&gt; (3) the hallmarks of a true revolution must be different to the tyranny they seek to overthrow (therefore love and peace and creativity and embracing nuance and humour) .

&gt; I found his book very insightful and well throughout.

Not to pour water on your bonfire but I was coming up with similar sentiments whilst at University some years ago. I just didn't have the soap box from which to shout it. Brand is *not* a unique thinker, he *is* good at making bite-sized sound-bites of quotable revolutionary spiel. 

&gt; He also suggests many idea that could be tried: technology can help create anarchic self-organising groups and direct voting (he references examples in Brazil and Switzerland). Corporations could be forced to hand a third of shares to employees as Sweden once considered.

So again he references things other people are doing. Fine, but he's not the brain child here. 

&gt; Consider your use of the word fanatics at the end. How thought through was that daming pejorative?

Not very thought through at all - it's a throw away term for those who blindly defend someone yet can't adequately explain why. *You* are the **only** person who has seemed to put any real effort in to this. I'm actually grateful even if I don't think my beliefs have changed much. You at least have made an effort and shown you're thinking for yourself. 

&gt; How much effort are you really willing to invest in making the world a better place, how well do you think your endeavours compare to Brand?

I'm forced to say my endeavours are minor compared to Brand - but this is not a shock to anyone and I imagine pretty much any of the 93,000+ readers on this sub-reddit would have to say the same. Brand is in a unique position of wealth, influence and access that I am very much not in possession of. 

Don't get me wrong, I applaud his sentiment, but contest his being held aloft by so many as (to paraphrase) ‘the reckoning that the system has long had coming’.

That I think, is determined by each race/ethnic group's level of prominence and influence in public life, which goes on to affect the general population's ability to relate to that group. And out of this, develops a deterrence against being racist towards that group.

This is especially true in 'working class' activities like football, because let's be honest,the vast vast majority of direct racism (verbal/physical abuse) comes from working class people - you're local chav on his bmx, etc. Look at Black people and you'll see how prevalent they've become in football. I will bet you that the same kids shouting out, ''ching chong chang, etc'' will not even dare utter the 'N'-word or call someone a black c***. There are probably several black players in the teams they support, making it somewhat difficult to shout verbal abuse against this race. And with the prevalence of black people, comes greater power for them as well. There have been countless high profile cases on the news of people severely reprimanded over their 'non-PC' behavior against black people. This has an immense deterrence factor on the general population. Being a racist (to black people) is now second only to a being a pedo on the ranking of society's worst-things-to-be. You can literally lose your whole livelihood if you dare speak the 'N' word or refer to someone as a black something-something. I'm not saying its all roses and sunshine for black people now, but I would argue that they've progressed a lot more than other races in dealing with public racism.

So how has it come to this for Chinese people?

Is it because they make up only 0.7% of the population here in the UK? Well, the Jewish population makes up even less than that, and you don't need me to tell you how unacceptable anti-semitism is today (it probably ranks even higher than racism against black people). The Chinese are basically not prominent and influential enough in public life. Can someone name me **one** British Chinese sportsperson, MP, comedian, actor? I certainly can't. On the other hand, I can probably list over 100 of those for Jews, who as I've mentioned, are an even smaller proportion of the UK's population.

There is also the problem that, unlike the other 'first generation' migrants (from India/Pakistan and Caribbean), most of the Chinese migrants barely spoke a word of English. This is understandable because of Britain's colonial past in India and the Caribbean. But it adds to the central problem of relatability for the Chinese, making it far easier for people to see them as the 'other', and therefore this makes racism against them much more acceptable.

Instead of raging at the idea of money going to Scotland rather than London, how about you support economic policies that will help build the economies of areas other than London.

Scotland isn't poor, but to say it's as rich as London is stupid. London is by far the richest, most economically powerful part of the UK. It's big, it's powerful, and it gets a lot of money from Westminster. Effectively, the UK has put the majority of it's economic clout into one 611.2 mi^2 city and on top of that, London gets a lot of investment. This is leaving a lot of other places out in the cold. There's too much economic clout concentrated in London.

Frankly we should be spreading out the economy a bit, we shouldn't have this sort of London centrism. We should be using the money from London to build up other cities like Glasgow, Manchester, Sheffield and Edinburgh to become economic hubs. They won't become ""New Londons"", that can't be done, but we could improve the country's economy to no end by spreading the economic clout a bit.

I mean... if Chinese find it offensive - and they do - then is it not as bad as 'paki' or 'nig nog' or 'wog' or whatever?

 If you understood how the constitutional frame work and devolution works, you'd realise that.

The UK government CANNOT specifically give money to another region specifically for 1000 nurses. It's not how funding works within the UK.

The NHS is devolved. The UK government cannot determine how many nurses the Scottish NHS has, and the UK government cannot go, ""Here's money to hire 1000 nurses"".

What would happen would be the UK government would give the English NHS money gathered from the Mansion tax, then through the Barnett differentials, money would then be given to the NHS in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in proportion to reflect that given to the NHS in England. And only then can the devolved government decide what to do with that budget.

If you could find someone to share with, then there are apartments around that area for £700 or so a month. You could get somewhere a wee bit cheaper in the Titanic Quarter but I imagine living there would be a wee bit soulless.

Maybe somewhere just off Botanic? You could walk straight down the Ormeau Rd into town and be there in 20mins. 

[How about somewhere like this?](http://www.propertynews.com/Property/Belfast/PNC542455/142-Agincourt-Avenue-Flat-6/304809695/) Right beside Botanic, you could walk straight down Agincourt Ave and along the Lagan? 

[Somewhere like here might be good too.](http://www.propertynews.com/Property/Belfast/MCQMCQ0528/400-Ormeau-Road/304813138/) A little further out, although you can get the bus straight into town and you're close to Forestside for shopping. If you're really keen on walking, it'll take half an hour or so.


Lots of young professionals are moving slightly further afield. If you're keen on south Belfast, Stranmillis is the place to look. Have a check on gumtree for flatshares - you could easily get somewhere decent for £200-300 a month. Other you could do worse than [this place](http://www.propertynews.com/Property/Belfast/CPM647620/F2-110-Stranmillis-Road/304809695/Page4) although you might want somewhere nicer/bigger, it's in a good location for the price. Flatsharing really represents your best chance of getting a nice place in south Belfast for the money you're talking, but decent places pop up from time to time, so it's worth keeping an eye out.

If you're looking for somewhere on your own, your next bext option is slightly into the east of the city. Ravenhill is a decent area (a little too far from the nearest shops for my liking, but there's a big park and you could walk to work in 10 mins). [Somewhere like here might work](http://www.propertynews.com/Property/Belfast/MCLMCC1378/2-Gotha-Street/304809695/)

You could also, depending on your tolerance to living in the heart of the inner east, get somewhere like [here](http://www.propertynews.com/Property/Belfast/MCX668329/4-John-Long-s-Court/304809695/Page7) or [here](http://www.propertynews.com/Property/Belfast/MCX668465/Albertbridge-Road/304809695/Page7) which would take you about 20 mins to walk to work from. You're not going to get much hassle living there, and no one's going to inquire after your business, but you might the flagginess a bit tiresome.

A wee bit further out, you've got the like of [this](http://www.propertynews.com/Property/Belfast/PNC641572/Flat-3-34-Earlswood-Road/304809695/Page6). You'd probably want to get the bus (it's 35mins or so to Lanyon) but it's handy to everything else.

Tbh I only know south and east Belfast well enough to say where I would and wouldn't recommend living, (and in any case these are the closest to Lanyon) but you may find somewhere tolerably close and cheap in other parts of the city.

So fucking what. Many people believe this. He's articulating a reality that is not hard to perceive. 

&gt;So again he references things other people are doing. Fine, but he's not the brain child here.

Referencing what other people are doing and synthesising it in your own authentic narrative is wisdom what were you expecting?

Hello Kettle meet Pot. You lazily call someone out for being intellectually lazy - only they are not lazy their effort to articulate the woes of society in a way that embraces personal self-development, spirituality and ecology whilst remaining authentic and at least a little funny takes real effort. You may not agree with his conclusions but this is not a man spinning out platitudes and condemnations because he is facile are cheap and dishonest. This is someone who has come from poverty lived through fame and self-destruction and wants to bear witness to the absurd idea that the way we live now is somehow fundamentally unchangeable in any meaningful way.

&gt;Brand is in a unique position of wealth, influence and access that I am very much not in possession of.

You know that's a cheap excuse. I'm not asking you if you have the same reach but made the same effort.

When you see rape reported in the press there's always a question of whether the victim is lying - you don't see the same public scrutiny of a victims testimony in other crimes. This underlying suspicion of a victims testimony is believed to be one of the leading causes of low conviction rates.

So there's a fair comment that adding in new protection for people accused reinforces the perception that it's likely the victims testimony isn't truthful. When it's already believed to be a problem in those kind of cases, why throw fuel on the fire when the same kind of anonymity doesn't exist anywhere else.

now with that said, you could argue it would be a good way to blood ibe, ilori, teixiera and origi but those guys are all 21 or under, and i would prefer them to get games in a less pressurized situation...anyways all in all, i would offer this to your suggestion that we bought 3 ""top class players""...it would have made more sense to buy 1 top class striker, and 4-5 of the players we already bought, in my opinon. to be honest, it was impossible to foresee the sharp downturn to mignolet's form (even with how poorly he played last year) because he had a solid start to life with us. it was also impossible to foresee sturridge's elongated injury troubles...yes he's injury prone, but he's never sustained an injury that lasted more than a month. it was impossible to forsee flanno's freak injury, or suso's for that matter (who unfortunately will be leaving). and as far as lb go, there is only on other guy who would have made me happier this window and that ricardo rodriguez. but im very happy with moreno and think he will develop into a fine left back, in addition, brad smith will continue to be a good shout for the job as long as he keeps developing and working hard. 

anyways, what's done is done and 20/20 is a beautiful thing. if i were to cut my losses in january, i would sell off borini, lambert, suso, glenjo, enrique, brad jones (also knowing that assaidi, coates, aspas and alberto are all probably gone in the summer, + skrtel and lucas could be gone as well) and i would bring in a right sided cb, keep ilori and wisdom in the squad, would replace the strikers with 1 big money striker, we keep balo as a wildcard bc his potential is still too high to let him go so early imo, develop origi and jack dunn. in addition, we'd keep ibe, tex and start to blood ojo, sinclair some more. anyways those are my two cents but yeah",null,0,null,1420558449,null,0,false,0,cng7n1v,null,t3_2re0um,null,t1_cng7n1v,null,t1_cnf6vga,null,null,null,1425029520,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

From the trial (undisputed by both parties):

&gt; Prior to arriving at the nightclub, at around 11pm, the complainant had consumed 2 large glasses (250ml) of wine after finishing her shift. She then went home, showered, changed her clothes and caught a taxi into Rhyl town centre. Whilst in the nightclub she stated in her evidence that she consumed 4 double vodka/ lemonade drinks and a shot of Sambuca. It was accepted at the trial that this amount of consumption would have placed her at approximately 2.5 times the legal drink drive limit. The complainant submitted in evidence that she would normally and regularly drink well in excess of what she had consumed on this particular night out.

&gt; The complainant then left the nightclub at approximately 3:00am. There was no evidence that she had consumed any more alcohol over and above that which she stated she had consumed, nor was there any evidence that she had taken drugs in the nightclub or after leaving the nightclub. **The friends who were with her on the night all testified that she was not particularly drunk.**

I do disagree with you though.  I really like Allen, but with the situation we have going on right now I don't think his qualities compliment us particularly well as a starter.  He doesn't look to advance the ball up the pitch quickly most of the time, and if we're trying to play on the break again, which it seems like we do a fair bit of in the 3-4-3, we often times won't be able to have him win the ball and play sideways before going forward as it'll afford too much time for the other team to react to the counter.  

I also don't think he has a place in a 2 man midfield as we just need far more pace and power there than he can provide when we're playing the 3-4-3 (or 3-4-2-1, however you want to label it).  If we go back to a 3 man midfield then we can fit him in again much easier, and I think he'd be best used at the base of that where he can do his thing without getting in the way of our transitions as much.

I wouldn't mind seeing him come off the bench to replace one of the 2 attacking midfielders in games that we're winning and need to kill off as he'd give us phenomenal pressing off the front and much bigger control of the tempo.  At that point the shape would probably change a bit to more of a 3-6-1/3-5-2 so Allen could sit in and camp the midfield a bit,  but that's fine if you're looking to suffocate play and see the game out.",null,0,null,1420558562,null,0,false,0,cng7p2g,null,t3_2rienc,null,t1_cng7p2g,null,t1_cng4svx,null,null,null,1425029498,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

Either in the sense that we are expanding outside of vanilla tourism, or that Tourism isn't linear any more and has transcended physical travel and due to the internet extending into commercial psychology.

The Royals are reality celebrities now - not in a classical sense - but in a more refined sense to the Kardashians... or probably more accurately reality celebrity families are a trashy version of Royals. I guess thats why they are given accolades like Reality TV Royalty etc

Either way, the family at the centre is the focal point of a lifestyle brand. 

The Kardashians don't require people in crowds outside their home to make money. People don't travel to see them especially.

The Kardashians need people to keep clicking the newspaper/magazine articles, reading the interviews, buying clothes or products they endorse etc.

With the royals, its might be the interview on XYZ network, the wedding at x location, the Gieves and Hawkes suits, the dress that Kate wears (or the cheaper ASOS version aggressively promoted on the daily mail), the travelling abroad on BA, the devotion to armed forces, the charity work, the benefits of a private british education blah blah blah

Don't make the mistake of thinking that just because you don't see the attraction, that it doesn't exist. Reddit is just a microcosm of western opinion, and the royal brand is global. 

ie. Consider a Malay/Indian Shipping Executive who still has some historic notion of bond with Britain dating back to colonial days who wants his sons and daughters to have a classic British accent and education like the Royals.

He is probably going to buy an expensive apartment in Maida Vaile to base the family when they are over in the UK for term time, send them to private schools and the best universities, buy classic British brands and once they graduate maybe deposit a few million in gov bonds to secure himself an investor visa. 

I've seen this, and one of these guys over a lifetime is probably the equivalent of tens of thousands of 'tourists' buying shit tshirts and taking pictures outside the palace.

Sure we could model tourism in a classical sense - x amount of american tourists went to buckingham palace etc etc etc

How about, how many american users clicked on articles about william and kate and within the next 3 months bought brands which were indirectly/directly promoted within said article, or aspire to aspects of the royal lifestyle.

something also worth mentioning is that Allen is a 'glue guy.' he needs to be played in the right matches in the right lineups. he cannot be an automatic starter. the frustration has to be at least shifted somewhat to the manager on Joe Allen. but to say he's overpriced or nothing more than a squad player is bordering on ridiculousness.

Obviously we arent going to be snatching messi, ronaldo etc and realistically we can never compete if one of the oil backed teams decide they really want a player. But i think we can certainly be looking at signing the next level of player down. Who can come straight in and improve the first team and look to develop them to be even better over time.

Although Mignolet's form wasn't predictable we certainly shouldn't have been in a situation where Jones is being picked as first choice. It was already obvious to most that Mignolet isn't, or will ever be a top class goalkeeper.

Personally im happy playing kids in the early rounds of the cup if we are competing in Europe.

I read the first BBC news article and couldnt find anything negative, in fact it sounds more positive than negative

&gt; ""I'm just giving children a feel of the army with my classes. But what parliament is proposing is real military training. They want to create young soldiers ready straight from the classroom.""

--

&gt; By putting guns back into classrooms, Russian politicians are trying to trigger Soviet-style pride in the military. But by creating schoolboy soldiers and ignoring army reform, the fear is they may be missing the point.

The next BBC article appears somewhat negative as well as the independent article and the last Guardian article is again somewhat positive.

So 2/4 of your links i would class as positive coverage and 2/4 i would class as negative.

Is that not balanced media coverage?

It's a joke. You must be an incredibly condescending person to suggest that Russell Brand thinks that the word ""economy"" has the word ""con"" in it presumably because of some weird illuminati conspiracy to poke fun at everyone, but somehow give them a clue that the odds are stacked against them.

null,false,bottomlines,null,null,null,"Exactly. I'd say that ""racism"" against Asians is different to the type directed against black people or brown people. Against black/brown people it is usually hate-type racism. Racism against Asians tends to be more about stereotyping and a more subtle categorisation of them as worse than white people.

There are almost no Asian actors, TV stars or celebrities, especially men. And they are pretty much never seen as sex idols. Some Asian women are popular or celebrities, but that's largely because they are hot and British people like them. This is subtly telling us that Asian guys are seen as lower or less desirable than white guys in general. It is reflected in real life too. For example, on the street you almost never see a white girl with an Asian guy but you see white guys with Asian girls all the time.

Also, when you do see Asians in the media, they are playing super stereotypical roles like the dorky, buck-toothed nerd, or the computer hacker, or as you said, Kung-fu, wise master with a long beard or other stereotypes.

Correct - but you must acknowledge that there's a divider where someone will take offense at something simply because you've used a word. Now, if that word can't be used in any other fashion (say, 'nigger'), then they have a point - but there's a stage at which people will say 'but I'm not using it as a racist word or in a racist fashion' - hence we can all still sing Baa Baa Black Sheep without going directly to jail without passing go. I would expect that most people would not consider this revelation a newsflash.

&gt;Myself and many other people have shown how words like paki and chink have been used almost entirely as racist slurs for decades

Shown where? How do you prove 'almost entirely'? And how do you explain people like myself replying with 'er...no, it's not quite that simple'? You say 'used for decades' - sure they have, but not by everyone which is the point you keep ignoring. Where have you lived for the past fourty years? I've lived in London my entire life, and have worked in Whitechapel for 15 years so I've been around/ worked with africans/ asians/ bangladeshis/ indians/ etc. for all of my life too. My outlook has *not* come from living in an all-white area where I could use terms without ever knowing their connotations. So...how come your cover-all statements don't apply to real life?

&gt;but because you seem to think that because it's also synonymous with corner shops and take aways that somehow makes it ok

Or to put it another way 'it gets used in entirely unconnected statements so often that to insist that *any* usage is automatically racist is insulting'.

&gt;The fundamental part here is you're continually trying to argue that it's perfectly ok to use a racist slur in the right context as if there's ever a right context to use them.

No, I'm arguing that the defining of it as a racist slur *alone* is ignorant and insulting.

&gt;Paki has never been used soley as a shorthanded description of people from Pakistan

Again, not true - and an astonishing statement to make as if it's fact - but I'm beginning to see a pattern here - note how all my examples are of things that *can* happen, and most (if not all) of your statements revolve around sole definitions with no exceptions.

&gt;it's been used as a derogatory slur,

Yes it has, by *some people*. But by everyone? In every instance? Everywhere? Ever? This is what I mean about absolutes. You're making a lot of reductionist statements like this based on....er....

&gt;doesn't matter if you don't think that

Sorry, but it does. Otherwise I could make the same claims about 'black', unless you've never seen anyone take needless offence out of context, anywhere, ever.

&gt;the fact remains that it is a slur which has a history of violence and discrimination attached to it.

It is indeed, and I don't like that, historically - but ultimately I've *had nothing to do with that*, it's never been the basis for which I use the word - and I would argue is generally the case for most people that do, so why are you so insistent on connecting the two as the only option when it's obvious that's not the case?

I've already given several examples of other words that also *can* be racist instead of *can only* be racist - your replies, so far, have amounted to 'no it's racist' - but when I give other examples that are pretty much the same (black, etc.), you don't address them.

null,false,Kesuke,null,null,null,"As was pointed out, the monarch owns the Crown Estate in every sense of the word - and surrenders it to the Government for the period of their reign. The result is a system where effectively neither the Monarch nor the Government ""own"" the land (given that neither can sell it or unilaterally act upon it).

You, and you alone, have created a separate legal concept of ""land in right of position"" vs ""ownership"".There is one framework for property law... it's called [English Land Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_land_law) (with a comparable equivalent operating in NI and Scotland).

This is backed up by the official description of the [Crown Estate](http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/faqs/#whoownsthecrownestate)... *""The Crown Estate belongs to the reigning monarch""*... *"" it cannot be sold by the monarch, nor do revenues from it belong to the monarch""* (i.e. because it has been surrendered in exchange for the sovereign grant). 

The link doesn't go as far as to explicitly say it (for reasons which are hopefully obvious), but in principle if a new monarch choose not to surrender the estate for the sovereign grant then in they would own it, in its entirety and not the state in any sense.

&gt; It'd have to be a pretty tyrannical monarch to take all the crown profits for themselves

But you don't understand. Regardless of how ""fair"" it is that they own the land, they still own it.

You can't have things without someone paying in some mechanism.  Even going back to some hunter gatherer style life, the gathering still is a 'cost'.

&gt; Again, this is a feature of capitalism - the economic system is based on unsustanability.

Eh, as Tim Harford better than I ever could wrote in the very introductory (no prior knowledge required) book The Undercover Economist, free market is a efficient de-centralised way of coping with the instability of life, such instability could be the weather for instance changing what kind of food is grown.  The point is that the decentralised nature of it produces reactionary system to demand, that can be incredibly sustainable.  This is why quality of life has always been better for most than those in planned or controlled economies.  Granted it will always miss, some, like a hill climbing or simulated annealing algo, it will often converge at a *local maxima* that isn't the global optimum.

When it becomes unsustainable, is when we have a situation, like the one at present, that debt is being spent by **government**.  That debt is either underwritten by domestic or foreign concerns who expect a return, defaulting on that probably would have negative consequences.  This isn't capitalism, this is resource allocation by state.

&gt;Those on small fixed incomes, whether benefits or pensions are usually fucked over as the cost of living and general inequality rise.

No because my point is about how one generation can have consumable benefits, that provide no long term benefit, paid for by the next generation.

Legal personhood in every other regard ends at the moment of death. Yet control of property is maintained?

It's unfair. But any system I try to think up for fixing it is even more unfair, so perhaps it's the least bad way of doing things.

It's tough though because as a relatively new fan to the sport, I tend to view the game (unintentionally) through an ""ice hockey lens"" for lack of a better term.

I know there are probably good reasons for it, especially against the quality of strikers in the PL, but I've had a hard time understanding why keepers don't come out and cut down the angle on shots more often, like goalies do in hockey.

Especially on 1-on-1 situations, it seems a lot of keepers seem to like to sit back and wait, when to me (and again, could be totally ignorant and wrong) it makes more sense to at least come out, cut down the angle, give the man with the ball less net to shoot at.  Which is what I really like after watching this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1Emol3m-mk

Ryan seems just aggressive enough, not comfortable just sitting back and waiting for a shot, hoping he guesses the right direction and can move fast enough to get to the shot in time.

That being said, I realize that this video is only showing the great saves, and not the ones he's let in, but his reaction speed, agility, and aggressiveness seems like something you'd love to have in a keeper.

Actually it was against that very position that MP Jacob Rees-Mogg argued in the video linked. He makes the point that there is a legal basis on which feudal lands became the inherited property of the families that administered them, and that in principle the monarchs land (i.e. both the Crown Estate and their private estates) would/and are effectively a product of this in all but name. **[Here is the link again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anb7BKIujtI)**.

I will concede, that if we became a republic tomorrow, in principle there is no reason that it couldn't be subject to inheritance tax which would clearly be a huge sting to the former-monarch, and ultimately would be bad for the state since it could lead to large parts of the estate being sold to the private sector rather than to the state (since it would be an open market as to whom the owner sold it to). However I do not agree with you that this is a strawman argument since there is clearly a legal basis on which the monarch could do as the video suggested and take the land that is, after all, theirs.

The only way I can think around it, is if you could form a legal argument along the lines of *""... Elizabeth II seceded the land in perpetuity in exchange for the Sovereign Grant. Since she is no longer to be monarch, the land is effectively the property of the state. However, the state would still be liable for the sovereign grant for the remainder of her life - since that was the agreement made"".* At any rate, these are complex legal arguments that would potentially go to an international court, such is the level of the debate and the complexity of the arguments involved.",null,0,null,1420562184,null,0,1420562391,0,cng9mwz,null,t3_2rbxpw,null,t1_cng9mwz,null,t1_cng46tx,null,null,null,1425028577,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I agree with your assessment of the big 2, it's perfectly logical from their standpoint. I think part of the problem is this idea that policy needs to follow votes,they seem to have no problem pushing an agenda that's obviously bad or wrong just because it will cost votes rather than doing the good for the future, big picture, correct decision.

That all being said, I realise you have to be cafeul what you wish for because just look at the shit Blair did because he thought it was 'right'.

http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Paki

One choice quote from this. ""Paki acquired offensive connotations in the 1960s when used by **British tabloids** to refer to subjects of former colony states in a derogatory and racist manner. In modern British usage ""Paki"" is typically a derogatory label used for all South Asians, including Indians, Afghans and Bangladeshis.

&gt;Yes it has, by some people.

""""Paki acquired offensive connotations in the 1960s when used by **BRITISH TABLOIDS!**"" So we're not talking about *some people* as you seem to think, were talking about a word that was printed in newspapers in the 60's. We're talking about a word that's been used by scumbags and racists.

&gt;Sorry, but it does. Otherwise I could make the same claims about 'black', unless you've never seen anyone take needless offence out of context, anywhere, ever.

Except nobody is taking needless offence when the word paki is thrown around because it's a well documented racial slur! The word black on it's own isn't regarded as a racial slur.

&gt;I've already given several examples of other words that also can be racist instead of can only be racist - your replies, so far, have amounted to 'no it's racist' - but when I give other examples that are pretty much the same (black, etc.), you don't address them.

Ok, lets address the word black shall we. Black, on its own is not a racist slur. You'll find that the only time it was ever considered a racist slur was when it had another word tacked on to the end, like bastards. Or even had one preceding it, like ""Those blacks"". Saying ""He is black"" is no more offensive than saying ""He is white"", it gets offense when you say ""He is a black bastard"" or ""He is a white bastard"". If you ask modern people in the UK today, people who are black, they will largely not be offended by being called black. If you walked up to anyone who was asian and said ""Would you be offended if I called you a paki, or your store a paki shop"" they'd more than likely be a bit fucked off.

The fact of the matter is you seem totally blind to the fact that paki has always been a slur, it's been know as a slur for decades.",null,0,null,1420562528,null,0,false,0,cng9tyz,null,t3_2ri47y,null,t1_cng9tyz,null,t1_cng90gj,null,null,null,1425028486,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,null,"Class is complex.  

For a start off, if you are poor enough that you don't/can't work you are not working class but underclass. 

It then depends on where you are from. In the US, class is basically dependent on how rich you (or your parents) are.  

In the UK (and, to some extent, the rest of Europe) it is FAR more tied up with history.  

Working class originally referred to farm workers and tradesman etc, the Middle classes grew out of certain trades, which we now regard as Professions (Doctors, Lawyers etc) and, later, from particularly successful merchants and master-craftsmen. The Upper classes were the nobility: the ones who had achieved large enough land-holdings and the associated power early enough that their support was needed by, and embedded with, the rulers in order to continue their rule.  

As trade (particularly) grew over time and (particularly in the industrial revolution) with the coming of new technologies, a lot of formerly working class people suddenly had as much money (=power) as the few existing professionals and even as much as many of the traditional Nobility, the newly successful had to find ways to show their success and distinguish themselves from the Working classes from which they had come.   

Equally, with power and wealth alone no longer keeping the nouveau-rich distinct from the Nobility, the Nobles had to find other ways (manners and behaviours) to remain distinct from these incomers. 

The result was the class system that we have now. Prime movers in the developing Middle Classes, at least, were wives of newly successful men: they did not need to work and so had a LOT of free time to devote to proving how different they were to common workers.

He knows about Danny’s heroic sacrifice, because Clara got in touch with the Pink family after the events of Death in Heaven (because you would, wouldn't you?), and told them what he did, and why. And she gave them the little soldier - and because she knows the toy soldier has to remain in the Pink family line. Now all that strikes me as pretty inevitable - that’s what would have happened - but I’m not saying it’s right. Nothing is actual till it’s in the show. Knowing how the season would end, we were careful, in Listen, never to define exactly what the connection was.

Been watching since 2003. I'm not saying you are wrong,  just don't see it with the players you are saying to drop mate, ..

If we  drop a defender as you claim,  we will have '2 defenders' in the diamond formation,  with no lallana,  so we will have  2 strikers,  6 midfielders and 2 defenders....  Now how do we fit that into a diamond formation.  That's what I am asking?  
We don't need to drop another defender as hendo and markovic have been wing backs,  just drop another midfielder,  say markovic .  So markovic and lallana are dropped for studge and balo, with Hendo,  phillippe ,can  and sterling in while adding one more defender?  So defenders are moreno,  sakho,  skrtel and manquilo.

I cant remember the last time I saw a bike that would be described as unroadworthy. And even if it was It wouldn't be a danger to anyone but the rider. Unlike cars.

Also, cant remember any example in the media where a cyclist caused harm due to a fault with their bike.

&gt;cyclists who commit traffic offences but can't be detected because they've no numberplate


A non issue.

cyclists get caught all the time in crackdowns. The same sort of crackdowns that catch motorists using their mob phone (note that plates don't solve that issue like a whole bunch of other motoring offences).

And in situations like hit and runs - we only have to look towards motorists to know no one takes this information down in time.

&gt;plenty of times cyclists have damaged property but got away with leaving the owner to pick up the bill

Plenty? got plenty of sources for that?

Im yet to hear of any cyclist killing a motorist. Damage of course does happen to cars and its unfortunate to be sure - but occasional  occurrences are just too small and infrequent to justify national regulation of (an estimated) 20 million bikes.

Compare all that to cars.....7 people a day die as a result of motorized traffic. Its not remotely in the same league.

Also - if it was an issue of note, insurance companies would be pushing the idea....but they are not.

No mention of Arsenal being bankrupt before Henry Norris took over in 1910 and having to rely on Tottenham money to keep their very existence.

The reason of course why Arsenal have blue in their badge in deference to Spurs.

White Hart Lane has been the home of Tottenham Hotspur for over a hundred years but, for a brief period during the First World War we had to play our home games at Highbury as the Lane had been taken over as a gas mask factory. Similarly, for a short while during the Second World War, Arsenal used White Hart Lane whilst Highbury was commandeered as a First Aid and Air-Raid Precaution centre. Legend tells that Arsenal made the promise that, as a thank you to Spurs for accommodating them, they will always incorporate a tiny bit of blue somewhere in there kit. They always wore a bit of white and often had blue socks but, interestingly, from 1946 Arsenal changed their socks from red &amp; blue hoops to white &amp; blue. The design lasted for 15 years right up to 1960 but whether it was done on Tottenham’s behalf is debatable as they had worn blue &amp; white socks previously in the 30’s. After 1960 blue only appeared in the Arsenal strip for 2 years between 1967-69 but from 1982 up to the present day there has always been a bit of blue &amp; white in the Arsenal strip, if only in the badge",null,0,null,1420564978,null,0,false,0,cngb8x0,null,t3_2riwgl,null,t1_cngb8x0,null,t1_cngazxu,null,null,null,1425027826,null,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2,null

Then you are uncritical of both the medium and the message..and the maker and the motivation. That mockery is a disinfo campaign.

If you try to buy an HD version or streaming version of The Trap, you cannot.  If you want to watch BBC documentaries by Adam Curtis in america on BBC's site, you cannot.  If you want to watch Charlie Brooker's stuff, you cannot.  Do not tell me there is no demand.  There is no demand in America because it is suppressed.  If Americans knew about this stuff, they'd be fascinated.  They watch dr who, downton abbey, and coupling, etc so yes they like things that are British.  I've had to torrent, and mine video sites for this stuff.  Thankfully you can buy someone's bootlegged trilogy that looks terribly-flea market photoshopped on amazon, which further degrades trust of the content therein.  It looks amateur.

When you go to hulu, no adam curtis or charlie brooker.  Youtube, you'll find it, click on it and it's been blocked by the BBC.  Sometimes I think bbc stands for big black cock in this case, because you're being big black cockblocked from watching what you want, which is a highly subversive but also quite truthful documentary series critical of american / british / western politics and social trends.

All of this points to one thing for me: someone is stopping all this and suppressing it.  There is a demand for sure. But someone at the top realized that Adam Curtis was more of the matrix's red pill than even high doses of mushrooms, so they cockblock it everywhere they can.  Question is: why?  If Adam Curtis' films are just bollocks, then why are they so dreadfully dangerous that someone has to manufacture an anti-adam-curtis video, expending quite a lot of effort in the process?  

When I see someone using ms paint to discredit someone, I assume it's because they are mad because their girlfriend likes adam curtis more than them.  When I see something that takes over 20 hours of editing and money to pay someone for that time, I think. ... hmmmm  what's / who's behind this?

null,false,GaryTheTallGuy,null,null,null,"So many people just don't understand voting in this country. It's quite sad really. I read half the comment on this thread alone and see that a lot of people just don't understand what voting is. Voting isn't really about electing someone who represents your views. No one, in the history of democracy, got to vote for someone or some party that accurately represented them. The best you can do is vote for the candidate which represents your views most closely. That may be pretty far off what you actually believe but it's an important thing to do and it's not like it costs you anything either.

As soon as a political party finds there is a significant share of voters that could be gained with giving them better policies they'll adjust and try and to sway these voters but political parties can only do that after they have proof these people will actually vote and there are significant numbers of them. In short you must vote first and then get offered what you want, not the other way around. Politics is an evolutionary process which gradually changes to try and please the most voters. It's important to vote because the demographic with the most voters is always more likely to get policies they desire. If you don't take part you're not only hurting yourself, you're hurting everyone else like you.

Look at UKIP. UKIP and their followers are a perfect example of this. For years UKIP voters voted for parties which refused to represent there anti-EU, anti-Immigrant ways. They never thought they got anything they actually wanted. UKIP saw this gap, took it and slowly built power with it. Now these voters have more power than ever over the Westminster and are slowly getting exactly what they want

Now I can guess at approximately how much you earn and if you'd be likely to have expensive stuff in your house like jewellery and so on, and if you might be worth robbing.

I can do things like find out where you work (thanks LinkedIn!). From there I can call the IT dept of your company pretending to be you at an important client meeting and needing my VPN password reset which could lead to that company being compromised too.

I could also do things like look up Electoral Roll records and see who else lives in your home for security question/answer clues for common websites. Birth records would also lead to seeing what your mother's maiden name is.

So a cyclist who comes up to a junction and can't stop because they have no brakes and goes piling out into a busy road isn't a danger to anyone else? Then there's the ones without front lights on I've been passing in my lorry on a night and not been able to see. This means I have to stay out in the other lane longer than I need to and spending a disproportionate amount of time trying to see the stupid fucker to ensure I don't kill them which increases the risk to other road users.

&gt; Also, cant remember any example in the media where a cyclist caused harm due to a fault with their bike.

In the media. Doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Lots of people get shot in the USA and it doesn't make the news because its not newsworthy any more.

But they don't get caught by traffic light cameras when they go sailing past a red one do they?

And now we go into hyperbole.

Which does billions of miles more a year than bicycles. The risk per km travelled is infinitesimal.

Because cyclists won't pay it until it becomes mandatory.

In almost every hospital you see a peak in decisions to admit people once you start nearing the 4-hour target time  -e.g. [here are graphs for each hospital in England for 2012-13 showing the pattern for admissions](http://gpaccess.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SIPR-Charts2.pdf) (pdf warning!). 

Some of the people who're admitted near 4 hours will obviously need to be in hospital, but there's no reason to think that they're any more sick than the people seen at 1 hour, 2 hours and so on. So, some of them will be admitted when they could be treated in A&amp;E or referred to the GP etc. As a result, obviously, you've got more people in hospital than you need to have, taking up beds, clinical time, and money!

null,false,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,null,"&gt;That's because it is a fucking fact. How you are so absolutely delusional about the word.

So someone (in fact, several 'fucking' people in this thread) points out that it's not quite that straightforward, and your reply is 'but I've found a website that says the tabloids did it in the 60's!'. But hey, anyone with info you didn't know about is 'delusional' - I guess we were all shouting ""Hooray for the Blackshirts!"" because the Daily Mail said it in the 30's as well, going by that logic - but never mind, I'm sure finding a website that states that terms like Chinky whose *only* use is derogatory will be easy-peasy. Off you go.

&gt;How you are so absolutely delusional about the word.

I don't know, maybe everyone in the UK that uses it is 'delusional' or just hasn't spoken to *you*.

&gt;One choice quote from this. ""Paki acquired offensive connotations in the 1960s when used by British tabloids to refer to subjects of former colony states in a derogatory and racist manner.

You mean back when it was nothing to do with me or any of the people that use these terms? How about that. And it doesn't change the problem of it not being used *solely* as a term of abuse fourty years later. Best you find a more recent website.

&gt;So we're not talking about some people as you seem to think

Er...yes we are, unless you assert that people using it *before I was born* somehow have a bearing on today. 

&gt;were talking about a word that was printed in newspapers in the 60's. We're talking about a word that's been used by scumbags and racists.

It's almost like you're raising points I've already addressed.

&gt;Except nobody is taking needless offence when the word paki is thrown around because it's a well documented racial slur!

But the word Paki isn't being thrown around. That's you applying *your own context*.

&gt;Ok, lets address the word black shall we. Black, on its own is not a racist slur.

Unless we work via your rules.

&gt;You'll find that the only time it was ever considered a racist slur was when it had another word tacked on to the end, like bastards.

Actually, I won't find that. Go look up 'coloured', why it was used and what it replaced. How about that.

&gt;Saying ""He is black"" is no more offensive than saying ""He is white""

Depends on who you ask, going by your assumptions.

&gt;""Would you be offended if I called you a paki, or your store a paki shop"" they'd more than likely be a bit fucked off.

And if you asked a black person 'would you mind if I called you black?' you're making it an issue where there wasn't one previously. I said elsewhere - would I call a Chinese person a chinky? Not really, it's never been an poser - never even thought about it. Would I call a yummy takeaway a chinky? you betcha. What you don't seem to realise is that Paki Shops were a major tool in arguing *against* racists - ""Oh, send them home? Do you work from the crack of dawn until midnight just to sell people milk? No?"" - hence, like chinky, Paki Shop is a term of reverence, which is why people still use it.

What's amazing is your reaction as if you've never met anyone in real life who does this and seem to think that 'educating' one person with your ignorance and abuse is a better idea than educating *yourself* and (whisper it) maybe even asking questions instead of pontificating and researching only as far as to confirm your assumptions. Reducing everything to black and white only works for Jack Ryan.

&gt;The fact of the matter is you seem totally blind to the fact that paki has always been a slur

Of course it has. As has black. And a host of other out-of-context options. **To some people**. Nobody has argued otherwise, but you're welcome to prove that it's only a slur, and has never been used in any other context, anywhere, ever, lots and lots of times (and going by the link you've managed to find so far, good luck with that).

 What you have to accept is the difference between a word that *can* be a slur and a word that can *only* be a slur meaning vastly different things.

The feeling is mutual.

&gt; But it's hard to escape the military thread running through everything the children do.

&gt; Andrei is all in favour of reviving a patriotic education

&gt; The patriotic side of his education at Kaskad has already left its mark.

You quote three lines that are ""negative"", two of which contain the word patriotic (since when is patriotism a negative word?) and the third implies all army cadet training is linked to the military... tell me how its negative to explain that all the tasks and activities children were doing *in the army cadets* were related to the military? im baffled at your disgustingly bias views. Seems to me like the media's view point is a lot more balanced than yours are.

&gt; The Independent

The Independent supports the Liberal Democrats, they support them this election and they support them last election. How is it not a liberal media outlet? Are you just trying to appear stupid now?

&gt; The only ""liberal"" one is the Guardian and I'd argue against that!

Ok... so do it?

&gt; I disagree, see terms like ""Obeying orders from their instructor"" and so on.

Ok, im seeing the terms; how are they negative? Is it negative for Soldiers to obey orders? Do you even understand what the army cadets is for?

Its as if you want these articles to not use the worlds ""military"", ""patriot"", ""training"" and ""obey"" or any other word that is to do with army training.

&gt; The tone is completely different from say this article about the UK's ATC[1] .

That might be because one is about 70 year celebration and the other is about the army cadets of Russia...

&gt; I could sit and point out the differences for hours and you'd find examples of them in the bulk of reporting on this topic.

You probably could, but at the moment you are just sitting spouting nonsense. You call certain words ""negative"" when they are in fact neutral. You say you could ""sit and point out the differences for hours"" but i have seen no differences.

We only really have Income tax, corporation tax, VAT, capital gains tax and Inheritance tax. People like to complain about the taxes but know almost nothing about them. Capital gains are exempt up to 11k and even if you're above that, you can get roll-over relief, entrepreneurs relief, etc. if you're making more than 11k, there may be very little difference in monetary terms compared to trading income, which is taxable. In most taxation issues when houses are sold by investors, for example, the debate is whether the sale of the house and the related proceeds, are capital gains or trading income. Removing capital gains would lead to a massive rise in gains being charged instead as trading income.

* He's very stupid, from ""Don't show me graphs I don't like 'em they oppress me!!"" to ""Everyone's debts should be cancelled!"" 

* He doesn't offer any solutions.  Not only does he not offer solutions, but he suggests completely stupid ideas such as stopping voting, and revolution.  The only way this system can be changed, and *should* be changed is from within.  Extra legal ""revolution"" would likely cause untold deaths and pain. 

* He has a reluctance to put his money where his mouth is.  He hates inequality!  That's great, then why is he a millionaire?  He could at the very least start his own party, and really get down to work.  He won't though, because that would mean *work*.  Oh and not only is he wealthy, he has property in the USA.  So if it all goes tits up when his shit ideas come into force, he can just leave, unlike the rest of us.

* He is complete narciccist.  I genuinely believe he is doing most of this to raise his profile.  This isn't just cynicism, but the way he has acted in various interviews such as when he drags that person from the housing estate interview into shot.  

* He's a bully.  Watch him on the Newsnight interview if you need immediate proof of this.  The whole Sachs thing was long time ago but still pretty awful.

* He is incoherent.  He has no idea what he wants.  He's permanently vague, and when pressed for what he wants, he says ""don't ask me I'm just a comedian, I'm just here to point out how shit the system is"".  Yeah well maybe it's the least shit system out there.  Oh and he wants free healthcare for all WHILST being an anarchist.  He is a self-proclaimed anarchist whilst clearly having NO idea what it means.  This is the level of intellect this man has.

Regarding the cartoon in your link the alternative to a car is not a taxi, it's a bike , bus or train.  Car owners wince at taxi prices too. The goal of home ownership is a cultural thing, most Germans for example, prefer to rent. In the days of council houses many British were happy doing that too. As I said before you are conflating consumption and investment and getting confused. I accept the cartoon's point about the bank access, loans are one thing that are cheaper if you have more money but that's not really anything to do with boots either.

Challenging the complacency of the collective wisdom of r/uk is not trolling.

With all of these being transferred to DCAs you *should* be able to get a settlement figure as a general part of collections (both contingent and purchased) is agreeing settlement figures. The only issue you may have is if any of the Halifax debt is prime in which case it's unlikely they'll offer a figure. 

With regards to how I'd go about it, just ring and ask what settlement is available, they'll never give you their best offer first time so say you were hoping for closer to X amount (say, 50%).

He's saying we'd go back to a 4-4-2 diamond, with 2 CBs and 1 RB and 1 LB as the four-man defensive line (probably Moreno/Skrtel/Sakho/Manquillo). Then there are four midfielders (Sterling, Coutinho, Hendo, and Gerrard/Lucas/Can) arranged in a diamond shape, and then studge and Balo up front.

&gt;Pritchard, the MP for The Wrekin, in Shropshire, attacked what he described as the “vindictive and outrageous story” that led to his high-profile arrest on 2 December. Detectives have dropped the investigation because of insufficient evidence.

&gt;Outside the House of Commons, Pritchard told reporters: “Sadly, as an MP, sometimes you have a target on your back. Of course, she remains anonymous. The law on anonymity does need to be reviewed and fairness does need to play a far greater role in these cases.”

&gt;His accuser’s identity is protected for life under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

Reina - are you telling me he wouldn't be first choice in the current setup?

Agger - prone to the odd mistake I'll admit but on his day was an excellent defender, a leader, a better option than either Kolo or Lovren right now and some great leadership qualities. Something which the defence is crying out for. 

Gerrard - he is more than worth keeping for his leadership qualities and qualities he still has on the pitch. Maybe not for 90 minutes anymore but he still has so much to offer. There are top players and pundits in the game telling us how much we are going to miss him. One of them being our very own in Carragher. I don't care what anyone says, Liverpool without Gerrard is a poorer club. 

One thing I do agree with is the big wages point. However I would counter that and say if you want decent players you have to pay for them. Those three players bring the experience to the team we're/will be missing now and in the future once Gerrard leaves. Not everything should be about money and the wages. And if you want to go down that route our net spend is 40m. Compare that to other top clubs in our league. Top teams have top players on big wages sat on the bench and playing in their first team. 

In addition players on big wages such as the three mentioned, sitting on the bench, aren't no where near the sum of 'X' millions of pounds we have squandered in various transfer markets on either overpriced players or completed flops.

I've already explained why I don't support aligning our law with that of the mainland, it's basically because less than 3% of abortions are carried out for the reasons the law was brought in, I have no doubt the same will happen here. That is a disgraceful situation and bringing in the farce that they have under the guise of these extreme cases is a con or at the very least naive in the extreme

How many women have to travel to the mainland for abortions for the reasons this law is sought.. Two dozen a year? bad as that is there are perhaps fifty times that amount making the same trip(or down south) for other surgeries.

If our law is changed here how many abortions will be be carrying out here..... Thousands? How does that work then?

Therefore it's pretty clear that a change in the law WILL decrease the amount of human beings in our society because abortion here won't be more necessary, it will just be...easier.

Now you're using hyperbole (more on that later).

But sure....It could happen. Like anything *could happen*. But does it happen at any noticeable level??? I would say no, without a doubt no.

But playing devils advocate.....there would be a chance that a break cable could snap unexpectedly - that's quite common and extremely unpredictable, and it has happened to me. Im not sure how an MOT could help with what is essentially unpredictable failure though.


&gt;and goes piling out into a busy road isn't a danger to anyone else?


Pretty much correct. Of course a lot depends on what you mean by danger. Cause a pile up, kill someone else?? Never heard of this happening. Cause distress to the person who might hit/kill them....Sure? But would the cyclist (like a pedestrian I might add) actually introduce the chance of killing anyone? Very very unlikely.





&gt;Then there's the ones without front lights

Not an MOT issue though - its a stupid person issue. The infrastructure is already in place to fine those who don't have lights or whose batteries run low. Of course they have to be caught in the act, but then again so do motorists.

&gt;In the media. Doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

Whenever a cyclist is involved in the slightest incident we hear about it.

&gt;But they don't get caught by traffic light cameras when they go sailing past a red one do they?

probably you're best argument. 

But ultimately it comes down the danger they introduce and the need to fix a problem that not really causing issue other than upsetting a few people.




&gt;Which does billions of miles more a year than bicycles. The risk per km travelled is infinitesimal.

Which misses the point.

It matters not how far a vehicle travels if at anyone time the proportion of road traffic is 2% cyclists and 98% mostly cars (that's the national average - places like Cambridge/London are much higher, other places much lower). The distance one vehicles travelled to get to that road does not mean the danger it poses to others is somehow less or more.

Other issues with that argument - cyclist spend most of their time/miles in populated areas, lorries spend a lot of time on very safe, very long predictable highways and A roads.

If you introduce large vehicles into populated areas they are shown to be by far the most dangerous thing on the roads. I believe buses are the most dangerous vehicle on London roads for example. The reasons for this are not because of the miles they travel, but because they spend so much time interacting with people.

So no, your hyperbole claim does not hold up.

Unfortunately (and I say this as a motorist myself) I, in a car are far far more likely to cause harm and death to others which goes back to my original point.

Cyclists are not troubled by the issues of insurance, tax, mots because there's so little statistical need to introduce it. 

If it was not the case, and cyclists where killing and harming in the same proportional numbers as cars Id be all for it. And its a conclusion that is pretty universal.


&gt;Because cyclists won't pay it until it becomes mandatory

couple of points...

It would be naive to think that if the insurance industry campaigned for cycling insurance the government wouldn't take notice.

And I can insure my bike for the total sum of £24. Which tells me one thing....that me/my bike is of such a low risk statistically that it only costs only £24 (lets say £10 of that is admin fee) to insure it.",null,0,null,1420572123,null,0,1420572305,0,cngfliy,null,t3_2rim8y,null,t1_cngfliy,null,t1_cngbk71,null,null,null,1425025796,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Hypothetically, a transfer fee of £200 million - amortised across 5 years - along with £350k a week wages means that Messi would cost us, FFP wise, just over £58 million a year.

To put that number into context:

- Hazard and Costa are currently our most expensive players FFP wise, costing us roughly £16 million a year.

- Torres, however, cost us slightly more when he was around at a little over £18 million per year. I do believe he's been our most expensive player from a FFP book-keeping perspective.

- Our 4 most expensive players, FFP wise, are Costa (£16m), Hazard (£16m), Fabregas (£14m), and Willian (£11m). You could add their FFP costs together and they'd still cost less than the aforementioned hypothetical Messi scenario (£58m &gt; £57m).

- What if Turkish Airlines and Adidas get involved? Well, assuming the ridiculous and utterly impossible scenario where the two of them pay Messi's entire transfer fee, he'd still cost us £18.2 million a year FFP wise. 

- Even if Turkish Airlines and Adidas were to subsidise half of his hypothetical fee - which I'd still say is impossible; there isn't enough financial incentive involved for them - Messi would still cost about £38 million a year on our books.

A person should be free to do as they please with their possessions.  What right has the state to dip their hands into my property.  Particularly when inheritance tax brings relatively little in to the coffers.

The truly wealthy can hide their money from this tax.  So we have a situation where potentially a working middle class mother and father in London who die cannot leave their own possessions to their child without the payment of 40%; meaning the child suddenly has to find a huge amount of money or lose the family home.

Is your story not actually a good example of people acting within the constraints of an imperfect system manipulating it in your interests? I think so, and hint time, it's because they gave a shit about your wellbeing. 

A&amp;E is an unpredictable environment which means that unfortunately sometimes people wait longer than anyone would like; especially when their case is a bit more complex but they're unlikely to be at imminent risk of death. 

It's the brutal calculation of utility that sometimes has to be made. A simplified example would be that you're in A&amp;E with abdominal pain.  They've checked you're not bleeding internally which is nice, and it seems unlikely you've got a blood clot in your bowel (hurray), so maybe it's appendicitis? It's an unusual presentation if it is, so we'll ask the general surgical doctor to assess you.  Then the other guy walks in with the same thing.  You take a back seat now because all the awful things you do not have, he might. Then there's a lady with chest pain (hopefully not a heart attack or a blood clot in her lung), and the girl who's broken her leg so badly that the circulation to her foot is poor.  Then there's also the older chap who's having trouble breathing. 

Then there are the other 8 patients in resus of whom 3 are trying to actively die, the other 11 in majors and the 6 in minors. I imagine you're getting the picture. 

Sometimes it takes longer that is ideal because priority one is making sure nobody dies.  Priority two is making sure nobody loses a limb or organ. 

The modern NHS in an acute setting isn't there to help you, so you are right on the front; it's there to help everyone else too.
