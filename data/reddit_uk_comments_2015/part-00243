Okay, here:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do they have battery operated, or hand-powered routers now? 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Yes, they do.](http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/tp-link-3g4g-single-band-n150-portable-battery-powered-wireless-n-router-n41ql)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So apart from spending £40 on that, how will I power the separate modem needed to actually get onto the internet?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Given that I've just shown you a portable, battery powered router, do you honestly believe that I won't be able to show you a battery powered modem?

&gt;&gt;Yes. Because there aren't any. It's especially unlikely for people on Virgin, where you literally can't change the modem to any other than the exact one Virgin gave to you - not even a different modem of the same model.

&gt;[Of course they exist.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/HUAWEI-E5330-Genuine-Stock-Mobile-White-21MB-s-SIM-Free/dp/B00KR51QCO/ref=dp_ob_title_ce)

I'm sorry, but you are quite clearly wrong.

Edit: Also, you can change the modem if you know what you are doing. That's how people get free Internet from Virgin.

- Always do the discrete questions first (w/o a passage)
- Only look at the clock once after completing two passages (do the math to time it properly, I forget how much time needs to be spent on each passage): if you are always looking at the clock you waste time and psyche yourself out
- If a passage looks tough skip it and do it at the end

We worked together long ago on a popular Kill9TV series, Boomer's Day Off (Left 4 Dead parody) and were once again imagining silly ""what if"" scenarios and came up with a goofy idea of a Dalek trying to get a job on Earth. At the time, we figured it was impossible. Casually off and on for a couple years, I looked for a Dalek that could work for the concept. Eventually, we met a Doctor Who fan at Gallifrey One (Steve) who lent us the robot twice (had to be trucked to So Cal from Arizona). 

We shot off and on over the course of two years in San Diego and L.A. with a bunch of awesome YouTubers who volunteered their talent to the project: J.P. and James from SMBC Theater, Jason Horton, Maria Del Carmen, Brian Firenzi from VGHS and many more. We brought back Ben Dunn from Boomer's Day Off and Tim Cross from ./shutdown (our first webseries nobody watches from 2008). Machinima, DivX and Ranker provided Gary's ""Office"" setting.

The project cost far surpassed what we collected on Kickstarter (a couple grand), but it was worth the expense and effort to turn what we originally thought was a funny, but impossible idea for a fan film into an actual webseries.

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"Unless there are some very unusual circumstances the landlord *must* protect your deposit. If he does not within 30 days (which he hasn't) you can go to court for (a) and order that he does protect it or return the deposit to you (the court decides which), and (b) compensation from the court at between 1 and 3 times the deposit amount. 

You are actually in a very good position - you landlord has lied to you and effectively tricked you into not protecting the deposit. Email him (ie in writing) immediately asking for evidence of deposit protection - you can also contact the deposit scheme administrators via their websites to check direct. 

If the landlord now protects your deposit you are then you are in the position where you can appeal any decision to keep all/part of your deposit to the deposit scheme used - a quick and free process which is very tenant friendly. 

If the landlord still refuses to protect the deposit you can go to court and get the order mentioned above and likely very good compensation due to the flagrancy of the breach. 

Even if the landlord protects the deposit now you still have a claim for compensation because it was late. Either actually do that or use the threat to get your whole deposit back. 

Do not be afraid of small claims court (but see edits in later posts re procedure). It is cheap, low key (ie not overly formal and scary) and you have a very good case. Overall try to view this as an opportunity - the law is very much on your side, but it is best to act quickly. You will be much more sympathetic applying to court whilst you are still a tenant (even if the case is heard later).

Finally - **call Shelter on Monday**, they are the best people to help you, don't *think about calling them*, don't say you will *get around to calling them*, actually pick up the phone on Monday morning and call them. 

EDIT: when all of this is over consider making a call to HMRC. There is nothing wrong with paying rent in cash (for the love of God get a signed receipt!) but it does smell funny. Don't use this as leverage though... it will reflect badly on you.

Doctor Who is *too* popular. David Attenborough is *too* popular. Top Gear the No 1 Fact. Ent. programme in the world? Damn. They'll be firing the executives responsible for such a fuck-up til next christmas.

This is a peculiarly British point of view. The rest of the world knows the BBC as the magic box which somehow manages to squeeze out incisive documentaries and dramas with the highest integrity and thought-provocation, and in the same breath makes global hits like Doctor Who and Strictly. The sheer *range* of the varied diet the BBC provides also guides the offer on the commercial channels.

He has slightly above average technical skills, but he has slightly below average physical and athletic skills.  He allows himself to be bullied off the ball too much and lacks the quickness and/or pace to beat opponents on or off the dribble.  Mentally, he needs to be more decisive, but he's shown the ability to find a quality pass.

One really positive thing about him is that he has exceptional endurance.  Unless, he's pulled for ineffectiveness, he can play at great energy for 90 minutes.  He also does a very good job tracking back and playing defense in Poch's system.    

I really don't see the wing as being his ideal position.  He's much better playing in the center of the midfield, ideally as a #10.  Almost all of his bright spots this season have come at times when he was playing centrally. 

Because of that, we haven't really seen Eriksen and Lamela play well together.  While Eriksen has shown the ability to play on the left, he's someone who prefers to operate centrally and there's not enough room for two players in one position.  I believe Spurs are better off with Eriksen staying centrally the whole game and not have to make way for when Lamela drifts in.  

At age 23, I don't see players having the ability to make significant changes or improvements to who they are as players.  Unless, Eriksen gets hurt or is rumored to be transferred away, I see next season as the last one for Erik Lamela.  In order to stay, he needs to make significant improvements mentally and physically; or be content playing as a squad player.

For a short term fix, I'd look at bringing in someone on loan from a club overseas who might be struggling as a team or wanting to just give someone a confidence boost. 

* Ciro Immobile, Dortmund, 24. Struggled with Dortmund last year, but if we're writing him off after what happened to BVB last season, then I suppose, Bender, Hummels, Weidenfeller and the rest of the blatantly quality players can also be written off. He was exceptionally clinical at Torino and when he got the service, he delivered. 10 goals in 34 games isn't as dismal as people might think, as of March he started 15 games on the bench. Dortmund might take us up on a loan deal considering the fans seemed to have soured towards him a little bit and a new manager is coming in.

* Pierre Michel Lasogga, Hamburg, 23. Hamburg were shite last year. No getting away from that. Lasogga suffered as a result, scoring 5 in 30. But if you look at his season prior to his move to Hamburg, he scored 15 in 24 for Hertha. He's hardly Leo Messi, I know, but he's probably looking for a way out of Hamburg and on a loan deal while Sturridge recovers, we would have a brilliant combination of power, speed and strength Ings, Origi and Lasogga as our fire-power. He's hardly my first choice, but I'd rather have him on loan than Benteke for a small fortune.

* Raul Jiminez, Atletico Madrid, 24. Seems surplus to requirements at Atletico, they might want him to go out and get some game time, he's not been great for them since arriving but he was exceptional at America and he's definitely got goals in him, the problem is that with Atletico he's nothing more than a bench player. Not sure I'd start him ahead of Origi or Ings though, which kind of nullifies the point of bringing another striker in.

On permanent deals, there aren't many to be honest. Rondon does intrigue me and I think he's got more to his game than Benteke. Seems like a far more intelligent player. Aleksander Mitrovic as a long term investment perhaps, he's done brilliantly at Anderlecht and for me has a far higher ceiling than Benteke. Pedro with the promise of letting him play down the middle, not sure if he'd take it but I reckon he'd cost way less than Benteke and fit the system more. Try to hijack Atletico's move for Vietto (if that's even still on the cards considering Jackson Martinez is going there), that'd be sweet. If we could get him for less than £15million, I think Berahino would be a solid acquisition, scored more than Benteke, is younger than Benteke, is quicker than Benteke, suits our style more than Benteke.

Check with your landlord - the property may already have active gas/electricity/water accounts with various companies. If so, you'll need to contact them and provide your details and set up a payment schedule. Alternatively, you may wish to change suppliers if you can find a better deal. Just make sure that any outstanding accounts are terminated if this happens.

&gt; How do I sort out Internet for this place?

Compare deals from each internet company online (it's a good idea to use a market comparison site) and pick which one is the best both for value and service. It's a good idea to check with your other housemates first before selecting a package.

Once you've confirmed the deal with a provider, you'll be sent the necessary equipment and told when your service will commence.

&gt; Council tax, I know we don't pay because we are students but do we need to let the council know or anything?

Yes - you must inform your local council about your situation. If the council is not aware that you possess an exemption, they will charge you the full amount and may begin legal proceedings if it remains unpaid. Your university should provide a certificate on demand which certifies that you are a full time student and thus exempt from council tax.

I became of fan of the Saints this last year.  I'm an American so my exposure to the Premier League (and soccer in general) was very limited.  I became a fan after watching some games of different teams and asking my friend for a team that wasn't a complete front runner (he's an Arsenal fan).  He recommended Southampton due to their recent history and success.
Being used to American sports there are dynasties in every league but there is at least hope for most teams that they will find a way to be at the top of the league within 5 years.  I was immediately blown away with finding out that there are a clear top 4 teams in the league and then 2 just under them, and then a few mid tier mainstays such as Everton and Westham, Stoke, and Sunderland and then everyone else.  

I read some criticism of Southampton as a 'feeder' club and that they produce many quality players only to ship them off to the top teams.  After talking to fans of the BPL and reading online it seemed that the way out was to perform well, constantly improve until you've proven yourself to be as good as Tottenham  or Liverpool and eventually challenge the top 4 teams.  Although we slipped a bit at the end of the season I was excited to see us finish right with Tottenham and Liverpool.  I was more excited seeing us get into Europa.  And after listening to the Men in Blazers with Ralph Krueger I felt like we may have a shot at keeping everyone except Schneiderlin.

One of the reasons I became interested in the BPL is because I began to play soccer again for the first time since I was a child.  I was surprised at what a great time I had and started trying to learn more about the game.  I loved playing as a defender and when choosing Southampton, Clyne was a part of the reason why.  I liked his style of play and it seemed like he had so much potential.

At first upon hearing that it may be difficult to retain Clyne I was disappointed.  But after Man U gave up interest I was optimistic.  I saw all the posts online from Liverpool but I didn't give them much credence.  There are plenty of rumors that go around in sports regarding player trades and signings but I've never seen as poor journalism as I did with Clyne and LFC.  The reports would go out of their way to make it sound like Clyne was confirmed tihout actually confirming that Clyne had signed with them.  That was really crazy to me.  After seeing posts that Clyne was unlikely to leave unless it was an absurd amount of money I felt even more confident.

My understanding was that many of the players who were poached (Such as Morgan this year) are done so because the players are top-flight and want to play in the champions league.  I can understand that, but it is frustrating to think that if we were able to retain our players the last few years, we may be good enough to compete for a spot at doing so.
I felt confident because in my mind, Liverpool and Tottenham don't seem like they have the upside that Southampton does.  If I were a player on Southampton I could see how we will soon be better than those other two teams if I hung around.  I assumed at that point Clyne was more likely to stay than leave.

It is frustrating to see him leave for a club that will in all likelihood not contend, while simultaneously putting us back further from competing, and the fee seems rather light.  So how do we improve?  This is my first transfer window while following the Saints.  It seems to me like the combined fees from Schneiderlin and Clyne should give us more than enough money for a decent return even after paying Toby right?  Where did the money in the past for the players we sold go to?  It seems like we should have quite the stockpile of cash about now even with the terrible Osvaldo signing we've still got to have quite a bit of money to spend on someone no?",null,1,null,1435348176,null,0,false,0,csjrnd4,null,t3_3b6d0g,null,t1_csjrnd4,null,t3_3b6d0g,null,null,null,1437374532,null,0,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,0,null

Whilst the size of the chamber is undoubtedly the most pressing problem currently facing the Lords, it is entirely down to the executive's stranglehold on patronage.  Every Government creates a whole host of new Peers, and the existing ones don't die off fast enough, and as a result the chamber is full to bursting point.

Off the top of my head, here are a bunch of other options:

**Enforced retirement**

Theoretically you could force peers to retire when they reach a certain age, increasing the rate of reduction in the Upper House at the cost of perhaps seeming ageist and not appreciating the difference in ability between different people of the same age - Sir David Attenborough isn't in the Lords as his brother was, but I can't imagine many would begrudge him the opportunity to speak on the natural world just because he's 89.

**Term limits**

Peers could theoretically be allowed to sit in the House for a certain period only - 15 years is the figure usually bandied about for some reason.  This would rapidly decrease the size of the chamber, at the cost of inevitably ridding it of some of its most experienced and knowledgeable members, potentially hurting its ability to scrutinise.

**A cap on the size of the House**

It could be stipulated that the Lords could not exceed a number of Peers.  This would ensure the size of the chamber doesn't get out of hand, but would require restraint from the executive's powers of patronage, the lack of which has created the problem in the first place.

Or, my preferred option:

**Put the House of Lords Appointments Commission on a statutory basis, remove the Prime Minister's powers of patronage and instead give the Commission the remit to fill the House technocratically to an appropriate level**

This, I feel, is the best long-term plan for the Upper House.  It would deal with the size problem and most of the questions around cronyism and patronage, whilst at the same time allowing the House to maintain its ability to scrutinise legislation in fine detail.  Like the above, though, it would require the Prime Minister to give up his ability to both reward his allies and top up his representation in the Upper House.  Sadly, the current Prime Minister does not seem remotely willing to engage with this as a possibility, and instead is content to ignore the pleas of existing Peers to stop sending new ones.

[As I've said here before](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/32fh5n/labour_to_replace_house_of_lords_with_senate_of/cqb4dn5), any approach to Lords reform needs to first and foremost consider what the Lords is **for**.

[Here](http://bma.org.uk/practical-support-at-work/gp-practices/service-provision/removal-of-patients-from-gp-lists) is the page with advice for GPs on when and how to remove a patient from the list.

The most relevant quotes:
&gt; Violence or threatening behaviour by the patient is a special case. It usually implies a total abrogation by the patient of any responsibility towards the doctor or other members of the practice and will normally result in removal from the list. As well as having a right to protect themselves GPs have a duty as employers to protect their staff, and as providers of a public service those with reason to be on their premises. Since 1994 it has been possible to request the immediate removal of any patient who has committed an act of violence or caused a doctor to fear for his or her safety. In April 2004 these provisions were extended to make it clear that the provisions extend to anyone else on the premises.

&gt; It should be noted that if practices do not remove a violent patient under these provisions, and instead use the normal removal process, they may find themselves being asked to justify why they did not do so if a violent patient subsequently registers with another practice, and potentially at risk of action should an untoward incident then take place.
The NHS England Area team, for its part, also has a legal responsibility and a duty of care to ensure that it commissions services to ensure that all patients removed under this regulation can only access NHS primary medical care through appropriately secure arrangements.

Email him again, summarise what was said and say you disagree. Give him some time to respond (a week or two) and expressly state if you do not receive confirmation of protection within that time you intend to start proceedings both to seek the protection/return of your deposit and compensation without further notice. 

You can start proceedings online at moneyclaim.gov.uk. Presuming you want to ask the court to *consider* giving you the full 3 times deposit in compensation (so £3900) I believe the cost is £185. Whilst in small claims the loser is not usually required to pay the winner's costs, it is usual for the defendant to have to pay this fee if you win. If there is a hearing there is a fee of around £350 (but the landlord may settle or you may ask the judge to just look at everything on paper, which is quite normal in small claims). The website guides you through the process quite well - it is designed for ordinary people to use. Shelter has a useful guide [here](http://m.england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/tenancy_deposits/getting_your_deposit_back/court_action_to_get_a_tenancy_deposit_returned) (have I mentioned you should call Shelter?) and see more specific advice in the edited part below. 

People often represent themselves in court. I would never advise someone not to get a solicitor, but it would cost a little bit I expect. Plus there is a very high chance you would never get there - serving papers is enough to scare 90% of people. Organisations like Shelter/CAB cannot represent you, but can help you prepare paperwork etc, and you should seek their help. Which leads me to...

All of this is only after the mandatory call to Shelter on Monday morning! I would not do anything until you have spoken to them. 

FYI the relevant law is the Housing Act 2004, but this was amended so be careful to look at the most recent version not the original. I believe [this](http://www.tenancydepositclaims.co.uk/documents/HousingAct2004retenancydeposits.pdf) is the most recent version of the sections relevant to you. 

EDIT: As pointed out below I forgot these specific claims are done the old fashioned way. The forms are available online - but again it would be worth talking to Shelter/CAB as they may have some more user friendly guidance on how to fill them out as it can be a little bit tricky. Shelter has a guide [here](http://m.england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/tenancy_deposits/getting_your_deposit_back/tenancy_deposit_compensation_claims) on compensation claims which has links to the forms in question (nb the court fees were changed just a couple of months ago so I am not sure their fees mentioned are fully up to date). The procedure uses what is called a ""part 8"" claim - this is legally more simple, but can be procedurally more complex, or at least different to normal (eg it doesn't get allocated to a small claims track) and all this will impact fees (could be £1000ish by the end) and any cost risk (there could be some). Whilst your case shoud be stron this is a big incentive to settle, or look into after the event legal insurance etc. All in all don't start a claim until you have spoken to someone.

Even worse was that the Police actually asked the club to put up the lights and stop the music *every hour* as a solution to this (as well as paying for police to be present at every club night). How hilariously out of touch can they be?

I once went on a Thomas Cook holiday to Santorini and our plane was delayed on the way back. I remember distinctly there being an obese northern lady who had been bitten by mosquitos to the point of looking like a plague victim. 

She was loudly complaining to anyone and everyone that the Thomas Cook rep had not said that she should close her window at night to avoid mosquitos, and that she would be taking legal action upon return. I think she had slept with her windows open for the whole week. I am making a wild assumption here, but I suspect that the Foreign Office do not have an official line on mosquitos either.

My point is however, that you are of course correct. There are people out there who need to be spoon fed every single aspect of their lives by the government, or someone in a call centre. 

My only contention with your viewpoint is the extent of sympathy we should extend to them.

In my book:

If your going to a country thats just had a revolution and is a widely reported hotbed for Jihadis recruitment - and you are relying on a *travel agency* for security advice... thats where the main problem is.

If your going to a country thats just had a revolution and is a widely reported hotbed for Jihadis recruitment - and you need to check with the Foreign Office about security... then you shouldn't go.

If your going to a country thats just had a revolution and is a widely reported hotbed for Jihadis recruitment - and you didn't even consider the risks... then I don't know what to say.

If your going to a country thats just had a revolution and is a widely reported hotbed for Jihadis recruitment - and you have an urgent family/business obligation/opportunity, THATS when you check the Foreign Office, and you make a risk/return based judgement call.

As I say, I'm old fashioned and I love my family.

You lose money, but you get a (hopefully) decent health insurance policy.

Just had a look and I should be able to ring Shelter tomorrow and see what they say about the whole thing.

I'm not frightened to represent my self in court, I'm confidant I could handle it especially with how good a position (I think) I'm in.

If he does get scared from the serving papers, assuming it comes to that, am I in a position to encourage him to compensate as part of an out of court settlement? I'm assuming if he offers to do the deposit at that stage to settle and I push for a Judge to look over everything so that I have a chance of getting compensated I have nothing to lose right? Would you advise to have a Judge look over it or to have a hearing?

Any idea of the chances of getting compensated, how likely it is?

You've got my point exactly about the Jiminez point. He's struggling. But Atletico signed him, the goals he has scored for them and back in Mexico were good goals and he can still become a top striker, but there's an opportunity for us to take him for a season, use him best we can and send him back regardless of whether or not it works out. We don't spend an enormous amount of money and we don't have a long term commitment to him if it doesn't work out.

Lasogga is literally a carbon copy of Benteke but younger, white and German. He also wouldn't cost us an absolute fortune on loan. He's deadly on the counter, good in the air and isn't a long term commitment.

It's pretty easy to look at Benteke's goal per game ratio and say, yeah this guy is world class, almost a 1 in 2 return, but actually for the last 4 years Villa has been set up around Benteke and have played to his strengths. Will Rodgers firstly ***want*** to revolve the team around Benteke? Absolutely not, it's his composition, it's his tactics and they're based around possession and an intelligent way of playing. Secondly do we even have the players to execute a game to Benteke's strengths? The only half decent crosses in our side were Gerrard and Johnson last season and they're both gone. So even if we tried to adapt to crosses, long diagonals, cut backs and counters, we don't have the players for it to work. Finally, would you ***want*** to see us play like Villa? Would you rahter we try to get back to how we were with dominant, punishing results like 5-0 Spurs, 5-1 Arsenal, 4-1 Everton etc. Where we were free flowing and fucking unstoppable on a grounded possession game or would you seriously be happy seeing Henderson pick the ball up 30 yards out and trying to swing one in at every opportunity. Like I said, Benteke at United might work, because they cross the fuck out of everything at every opportunity, but not with us. 

We said Charlie Adam was immense when we signed him because he was Blackpool's talisman. The same for Downing. The same for Balotelli. It's not as simple as carrying on your form at your former club at the new club.

I'm sorry buddy, but someone's height is not a reason to make him your primary target in an absolutely crucial transfer window. Technically, I'm talking about passing, positioning, dribbling, general footballing intelligence, Benteke isn't going to fit in with a team where he's being fed by technical players. That's why Sturridge is deadly, because he's a smart player. Benteke isn't. 

More importantly I want to point out that Griezmann cost Atletico £24million, Luciano Vietto's release clause is around £20million, Suarez cost us £22million and Barcelona bought Sanchez for a similar fee. So is Benteke **really** worth £25million? Personally, I think he's probably worth half of that, at a push.

null,false,Baconesque,null,null,null,"1) Make sure you take a reading from each meter immediately. Your meters will have serial numbers. There's a national line you can call for gas and electricity (different numbers for each) to confirm who supplies your utilities, then you get in contact with the company in question. Be careful about the fact that it's shared; you don't want to end up being the one solely responsible for the bills. Are you sure the landlord isn't responsible since it's a shared property?

2) It's a bit of a pain. Generally you'll have either or both of a Virgin Media or BT Line, you can probably get an idea by looking for a phone or cable socket along the wall (will look a bit like a plug socket). They both have online checkers too but the BT one can be a bit funny if you don't know the number of the line that's there already. 

If there isn't a line in place already you'll have to pay a silly fee to get one installed, but generally this would only be the case with some new builds, you'll likely have one or the other.

If it's a BT line, these are 'unbundled' (may be the wrong term) so you can go with any of a number of providers. If it's Virgin, only them. There may be other options if you're in a big city. 

3) Yes, you'll need to let them know who lives at the property but also confirm everybody is exempt. Generally you can do this online - there are a whole bunch of councils so make sure you get the right one.

It does over a billion pounds of business with independent production companies each year. Not many would survive without the BBC's custom (and those that would are the Super Indies or Mega Indies that have been snapped up by the likes of ITV, NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox).

ITV does what they do to compete with BBC One. Channel 4 does what *it* does to counterpoint the BBC. By removing the BBC from swathes of programming, you change the nature of the other broadcasters.

We are also dangerously close to a monopoly in the commercial sector. Martin Sorrell's WPP is the biggest advertising buyer in the world and is continuing to grow, and is responsible for a high proportion of the ad time sold by ITV, Channel 4 and Sky. In addition it sponsors programmes in return for an editorial influence, and even produces its own programming for ITV and CH4 to have even more brand exposure for its clients. A couple of years back, WPP (through subsidiary Group M) and Channel 4 had a major spat which led to WPP withdrawing its business from Channel 4, which at the time was around 29% of CH4's income from commercials, until an agreement was finally struck. This sort of power needs an equally powerful counterbalance, which we have in the BBC's 49% audience share.

Broadcast (broadcast's trade journal) has launched a campaign to support the BBC throughout the renegotiation process, and it has currently attracted 400 of the top people in the commercial sector, who believe in the need for a broad, powerful BBC.",null,0,null,1435353342,null,0,false,0,csjuw0u,null,t3_3b65iz,null,t1_csjuw0u,null,t1_csjsjnj,null,null,null,1437376580,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

You're right BR's tactics are centered around keeping the ball and pass-and-move, but how can you guarantee that Benteke wouldn't fit that? He's great at holding up the ball, a good passer, and a good long range shooter(which we lacked last season, besides Balo's 40m attempts). Benteke's positioning is also good, just look at his game against us in the FA cup. His run between Skrtel and Can and his unselfish backheel set up the second goal, and his positioning at the top of the box got him the first goal. Benteke is a player that when not tightly marked will make you pay. We need a player like that who will instill fear into opponent defenders and also give our other players space as more defenders will be drawn towards him. Jimenez can't do that. Lasogga can't do that. Rodgers will play to Benteke's strengths because he is a smart runner with the ball, is a good passer,and is also a big-game player. He's a player that we need, but most fans don't want him because of the price tag. Any PL player is going to cost a premium, and Benteke is worth that.

null,false,miomike,null,null,null,"We do have a reasonable stockpile of cash I imagine, but there's always a big difference between income and expenditure, one way or another, for transfers. Some money goes towards wages (or increased wages all around) some goes towards facilities etc. There was a report in the local newspaper a while back saying we can reinvest a lot of the money from last year's sales, which would be good though I'm not sure how likely we are to re-invest it all.  

We would/do definitely have enough for Toby and a few more if we wanted, but you gave a great example of why you do have to be careful sometimes - Osvaldo was a huge flop, basically the absolute worst transfer a club can make - expensive, didn't deliver much, caused havoc in the team and then had to be shipped out, but no-one wants him and we'll get very little return on him.  

Without a massive fan base, huge sponsorship or anything, player sales are a huge part of how we can stay afloat as a club and try to improve. The idea that we are a feeder club who solely exist to supply the top clubs with new players is erroneous though. We don't have a design to do things like that, but the appeal of the bigger clubs, with European football and huge budgets for wages etc, greater exposure (for national team and such), means we basically can't compete. Those teams can pay sums that will buy us 2 players and pay their wages for a while for the cost of our 1, and they can offer more money and other things to draw the player to them. We don't want to be a feeder club, but that is how football works.  

And how we think about things isn't necessarily how they do. I would be lucky to ever earn £50k a year in my life time, but these players (the ones who leave us) are likely leaving for wages of about that much a week. People say ""they only have a short career, got to make the most of it, move to the clubs that earn the most money"". Sure, why not. They don't have the same loyalty to one club we do - they see it as a career, move to the better job (the bigger club with more money). We'd do no different.  

The loyalty we feel towards the club isn't the same as theirs. We follow the club no matter what happens, the players, manager, staff, ground, everything can change and we'll still support them. For them the club is just a place of employment. Sure they may be the place that trained you, but you don't always stay at the first place you work (god knows I didn't).  

Our only hope of improving is that we could manage to buy other young-ish players that can develop while with us, stay as long as we can keep them, and help the club carry on climbing the table while doing so. The main problem with that is it gets harder and harder the higher up the table you get, and also very difficult when you get where we are because the top clubs want the best players, but the top clubs don't often sell directly to each other, so they go to the ""best of the rest"" and take their players. That for the last 2 seasons has been us.

Stekelenburg is basically the best of a far from ideal situation - we couldn't afford to not get a PL level keeper in because k. Davis/Gazzaniga leave a lot to be desired at times (though I think Gazzaniga did OK in his two games, not necessarily great but not terrible), but we didn't want to buy a new keeper because Forster would be our first choice as soon as he returns, but many keepers we could have aimed for would not be OK not getting game time.

null,false,gin0clock,null,null,null,"There's no misconception. I've got a couple of friends who are huge Villa fans, both who agree that Benteke would fail miserably in a team that didn't suit him. Jimenez &amp; Lasogga were short-term solutions, I'd rather be going for the other guys I mentioned. Most importantly I'd rather buy a signing because he's perfect for the team, because there's no doubt that that signing would come in and move mountains immediately. I've never said at any point that Benteke is a big fat lump who only scores headers. His strengths are in the air, not on the ground (something the rest of our squad are versed in).

I can't guaruntee Benteke wouldn't fit, I'm speculating. I'm going off the evidence I've seen, which tells me that he's not worth anywhere near £20million and technically hasn't got anything on so many other talents across Europe. The only 'big' men that have worked at LFC in the past 20 years are Crouch &amp; Heskey, the rest (Morientes, Lambert, Balotelli, Carroll) simply haven't worked. Not just inconsistent, but actually quite awful despite the fact all 4 were successful at each of their former clubs. He doesn't fit the footballing culture of LFC. Call that a pretentious statement, but I completely stand by it.

Your example about him destroying Skrtel &amp; Can doesn't work on two levels. Firstly because Can isn't a center back, so where's the merit or impressive ability there? Secondly, the reason he could roam free is because Gerrard (who was supposed to be protecting the back 4 or back 3, whatever the fuck we were playing) was still trying to get back into position, so Benteke had a clear run on us. 

I disagree with 'big-game player' completely. His only 'big game' was against Arsenal in the FA Cup final and he went missing for 90 minutes while they got thunder-cunted.

I think you're looking at Benteke with rose-tinted glasses pal. He's good, he's been great at Villa, but he does not fit our team in the slightest. And y'know what mate, if PL players cost a premium, look elsewhere, fuck paying ridiculous amounts for players when there are better players abroad.

His work rate is always phenomenal which is crucial when you have Ivanovic pushing up high and the other team start countering quickly. Some of his games later in the season were pivotal for the team, you just have to watch the game against Leicester. He was a major influence in getting us back into the game with his pace and countering runs especially.

Overall if we were to move anyone out of our attacking midfield 3 it would probably be Oscar based in his last season. He was patchy throughout and went missing in quite a few games. Hopefully with his first rest in a couple of years this summer he will be able to bring back some of his form we saw when he first played for us.

I am comfortable with whatever you conclusion you chose, although I suspect the last option is not the case.

Anyway, irrespective of your dispositions, at the end of the day 5 people went on holiday in a country that: 

* Has just had a revolution.
* Is a well document hotbed for jihadi recruitment.
* Borders Algeria, a historically unstable dangerous nation and known hotbed of fundamentalist Islamism. 
* Borders Libya, an *actual* war zone where IS are battling for control of the country.
* Literally half the territory is considered an extreme travel risk by the foreign office.
* The safe half still comes with a strong security warning.

... and they were a victim of terror.

Yes, its a tragedy that nobody wants to hear, or experience, but there is a limit to the sympathy one can feel in this situation. 

I don't think that Brits going on holiday **a few hours away from active war zones** don't love their families, but I think they are taking massive unnecessary risks for a week in the sun when there are so many other options out there. I've been to Tunisia a long time ago and it's great. I understand the attraction, but with the ISIS situation in Iraq/Syria exploding into Libya this year - no fucking way...

I am conscious of the situation, and I love my family. That's why we are not going on holiday close to an active war zone, and will probably chose Spain instead.  

I'm not saying that they don't love their families... I'm saying that people need to do their homework.

null,false,TheAntiqueTraveller,null,null,null,"Ok, this is why it is important you speak to someone who can help. You have more than one claim - you have (a) you have not protected my deposit, (b) you didn't do it in time and give me the required information. If the landlord gets scared and offers to or does protect the deposit that deals with (a) entirely and you should accept, but be very careful not to agree that as a settlement to (b). Any settlement *must* be clear as to what it covers. If the landlord offers money to settle everything that's fine, just make sure you are happy with the amount. Courts very much encourage settlement (vast majority of cases do) and will not be impressed if your landlord makes a reasonalbe offer and your carry on anyway (this doesn't mean you need to accept an offer much lower than you think you are entitled to though).

Looking on the papers has some advantages - it is cheaper, often quicker, and less intimidating. The question is do you feel as though you can look sympathetic enough on paper, and have you explained yourself clearly enough to be confident the judge will understand. Remember a decision on the papers is just as binding as at a hearing, only you can decide what it best. 

As to the chances and level of compensation... well it is story time. Remember I said the Housing Act was amended? Originally the compensation was fixed at 3 times the deposit, end of story. However, imagine a landlord forgot to do the deposit and protected it one day late on day 31 - under a literal reading of the old act the tenant could then Sue and get 3 times their deposit in compensation. This was considered draconian (which it kind of was...) and so the Court of Appeal (a very senior UK court) interpreted the law such that if the landlord protected the deposit before the court hearing no compensation was due. However, this was felt to go too far the other way - a landlord could be a total dick (like your's) but protect the deposit just before a hearing and be in the clear. 

Hence this amendment a couple of years ago tried to find a middle ground. The law now tries to make clear that compensation is due as soon as the deposit is late, and protecting later does not cure that. However, the Court now has more discretion as to how much compensation it awards - it must award 1 times the deposit, and the maximum is 3. Therefore, on a literal reading of the current law the court cannot award you any less than £1300 (even if the landlord decided to protect your deposit tomorrow). 

Now, I personally think that a landlord who protects a deposit on day 31 being liable for at least the deposit amount is still a little bit mean - so we will have to see if the courts again try to do something clever like they did the first time. But overall the more dick-ish you can make your landlord seem (with respect to their treatment of the deposit, not their conduct generally) the more compensation you should get. Given what has happened already, you have a good case I think, but what is the caveat I will give to that?

Equal marriage is important, in that it helps remove a form of legal discrimination and it can be empowering for some LGBTQ people.

&gt;More than 100,000 people in Northern Ireland own firearms, having 380,000 among them.[46] Gun control laws in Northern Ireland are less restrictive than gun laws in the rest of the UK, due to the Good Friday Agreement, allowing Northern Ireland to govern itself and pass less restrictive laws. Gun laws in Northern Ireland are primarily affected by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004. Under the new law, first-time buyers will be required to demonstrate they can be trusted with the firearm. It will be up to firearms dealers selling the products to tell new buyers, and those upgrading their firearms, about the safety procedures. Firearm possessors in Northern Ireland must not transport their firearms to Great Britain. All gun owners in Northern Ireland are required to apply for a firearms certificate to possess firearms. Permits are normally issued to anyone who has good reason to possess firearms, such as target shooting, hunting, and personal protection.[47] Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom where personal protection is accepted as a legitimate reason to obtain and own a firearm and is the only part of the United Kingdom where handguns are permitted. Semi-automatic rifles are only permitted when chambered in .22 calibre (with certain exceptions). Handguns and Shotguns are permitted in any calibre. There is no limit on magazine capacity for rifles and handguns, and the magazine limit for shotguns is 2 rounds. Also, carrying a firearm in plain view in a public place is allowed without a permit. Open carry of handguns is not common. However, in the countryside, people will often open carry loaded rifles and shotguns.[46] A firearm certificate for a personal protection weapon will only be authorised where the Police Service of Northern Ireland deems there is a ‘verifiable specific risk’ to the life of an individual and that the possession of a firearm is a reasonable, proportionate and necessary measure to protect their life.[48] Permits for personal protection also allow the holder to carry their firearms concealed. They may also allow the holder to possess fully automatic weapons and center fire semi-automatics in some instances.

Benteke is a player that, either this year or next, will move to a big club, and it'll be a shame that we won't get him. Now, to look at him from an un-biased view, I agree that Benteke doesn't fit our playstyle, because we don't cross the ball enough, but how many times this season have Sterling or Lallana crossed the ball into the box just for no one to be there? Other teams already know how to play against us essentially, because they can just give us the ball, defend deep, and anticipate that we'll try to move everything along the ground. I'm not saying that we should change for one player, because there is a 35-45% chance Benteke would be a flop, but wouldn't that show that we didn't learn anything from last season? Why do you think Benteke is our top priority? 

And I meant 'big game' relative to Villa's size. An FA cup semifinal at Wembley is a huge game for Villa, and he showed up. Towards the end of the season when Villa were almost relegated, those were big games, and he delivered by scoring almost a goal every game.

It may sound like I have a biased opinion towards him but that's because I believe there is more upside to him and he is yet to reach his peak. Bacca, however, is on the decline and can only provide at most two prime years.

No it doesn't. I don't think you understand tactics in this sport. Of course he was taken out In favor for Ramires because you don't ask a CAM to play CDM all game. No matter who we had at CAM they are getting pulled for a CDM to come in. Some games we play more defensively. Why would Oscar play that far back? 

&gt;You seem to understand that part. Whatever reason Mourinho had for benching Oscar, for example tactics, is another discussion. Now moving on to the greater discussion, my main point is that you cannot say someone is as vital as Hazard or Terry, but then clearly have instances where you purposefully leave them out of the team. There is no such instance where we would leave Hazard or Terry or even Matic out of the team for ""tactics"".

But you can. He isn't left out because he lacks talent. He is left out purely because we don't play CAM in those games. He can't play CDM can he? Hazard plays every game because no matter how we play it's going to be with two wingers. Terry always plays because we always have a CB in the formation. Matic plays because we also have at least one CDM in our formation. Oscar sometimes doesn't play because we don't have a CAM in the formation. When he doesn't play we play two CDM and a CM. Oscar doesn't play CM or CDM. Do you see how him not playing has no correlation to his talent?  No matter what CAM we buy they will never play in games Mourinho wants to play more defensively. It says nothing about their talent.

1% passing is negligible. Eriksen averages a longer pass by about 3 meters. His passes are more ambitious and with that distance difference as well there's not much of a talking point here.

The matches that lamela didn't play in are also a factor. He sat both Liverpool and City matches home and away, he didn't start away Chelsea and didn't play home Chelsea. That's about 480 minutes against strong opponents that lamela didn't play in. Tough matches like that bring Eriksen's avg creation per minute down while Lamela's sits pretty. Eriksen averages 2.2 key passes /90 to Lamela's 1.

Defensively, they average .1 different in tackles, yet lamela has about .7-.8 more fouls per game with many more yellow cards. Lamela has the edge on interceptions by a touch. Lamela works hard on defense, usually out of frustration from losing the ball, it shows in the amount of fouls and cards he gets for reckless, frustrated tackles.

If that's the case, then the *real* problem is that those MPs are just not getting promoted, they are languishing on the backbenches. The ""face"" of Labour will always be it's cabinet or shadow cabinet, but if the only people who get those jobs are London metropolitan types, then that is the image that attaches to the party.

I think a similar thing is going on in Northern England - there is a lot of talk about the UKIP threat, but there was one Lab MP who saw them off easily. Simon Danczuk took Rochdale off the LibDems in 2010 - and then increased his vote by 10% in 2015.

But there is zero chance of Danczuk getting off the backbenches either, no matter how much his constituents like him. His version of white-van-man-Labour, with his northern working class wife, makes the London spadocracy uncomfortable.

Yes I do. Mourinho is a mastermind with tactics. That's what makes one of the best managers in world. He is unique. He plays with lineups depending on teams and players we play. If we had any other manager Oscar wouldn't get taken out of the lineup. But if Mourinho doesn't want the other team to score he plays more defensively. It says nothing about Oscar. 

&gt;If Oscar was as vital to our team as Hazard, Mourinho would find a million other ways to make him fit into the team. The most simplest being replacing Fabregas with Ramires instead of him. Again, there is no tactic or mentality in the world that would keep Hazard, Matic or Terry out of our team, ever.

But he doesn't fit anywhere else. He doesn't have the pace or stamina to play on the outside. He also doesn't fit at CM. He doesn't have the same deep mid vision as Fabregas. Or the long ball pass. Which he doesn't really need if he is playing in the CAM role. I think he is near the level of Hazard, Fabregas, Matic, and Terry. But only if he is playing in his respected role. Playing him out of position helps no one. That doesn't say he lacks talent tho. If you moved Hazard to CDM or CM how well do you actually think he will play? Tactics and players position means a lot in this sport. Players train most of their careers in one to two positions. You can't ask them to play in other positions in World Class form. You have other players to play those positions. Like Ramires.

So, that out the way, I totally agree with the thrust of this article. I don't hate the Tories in particular for this sin because all of the political parties do it because old people vote and because young people mostly don't, but that doesn't make it right. I'm in my late 20's and so still (*just*) consider myself part of the young generation, and I think we're all being screwed. From buy-to-let being a go-to way of making money for the older, from free bus passes to people who can afford planes wherever they feel like taking them to, to the winter fuel allowance which, while it keeps many vulnerable old people heated, also just pays out a sum to many who can easily afford heating due to it not being means tested. The youngest among us don't even get an equitable minimum wage, and god forbid you're young and unemployed you're expected to do workfare, but only if you're young mind. If you're young you're expected to move back in with your parents, but again, only if you're young.

As someone who earns a good salary in this country, and who could entirely be of the ""Well I'm fine so fuck you"" mindset, I'm deeply unhappy at the way the young are treated in this country these days, and at the ""look how entitled they are, wanting free education like we had"" attitude of the generation which came before.

Honestly, if you're under 30 in this country, you're being screwed, and the only way to stop that is to vote, so please, start voting. We need more than that, we need people getting into politics, we need activism, we need protests, we need people to write to their MPs, but most of all we need all of you to vote, because without that, you may as well either settle into servitude or hope that you can play the system well enough to angle to become one of those bastards who screws young people in 10-20 years time.",null,0,null,1435363536,null,0,false,0,csk0gy5,null,t3_3b6nyo,null,t1_csk0gy5,null,t3_3b6nyo,null,null,null,1437380161,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

1. Hire a bike from the Brompton Dock at Temple Meads; it's ideal for this. £5 a day, £1 a year membership. http://www.bromptonbikehire.com/ Sign up, reserve a bike, go to Temple Meads.
2. The dock is just outside the station, keep going straight after you leave through the ticket barriers (i.e. don't turn left where the taxis are). Go to the dock, punch in a code, collect your bike.
3. From the dock, you'll go down a ramp, across a little-used road, past Starbucks, over a pedestrian bridge, and eventually to a road. See Figure 1: http://i.imgur.com/juiCfoN.jpg
4. Go onto the road, then immediately turn left. Go along this road until it gets to a T junction. Turn right, then immediately left. Follow this road until it gets to a park; ride into the park and you will be on the Bristol to Bath Cycle Path!! See Figure 2: http://i.imgur.com/vLNT1ch.jpg

You'll be in traffic for maybe 1 minute getting to the Cycle Path. Once on there, it's just pedestrians and other bikes. Just remember to signal (stick your arm out in the direction you intend to turn) and wait for a break in the traffic, and you'll be fine.

Any questions, let me know. Once you get to Bath, there's a direct biking line to the Pizza Express, which I highly recommend.

For maths i honestly didn't do much but what i did revise I made notes of the basic principles or rules of the topic (e.g. For surds I would write out what happens when you multiply, divide etc.) and normally included an example to make sure I could do it. If this doesn't feel like enough you could do more practice questions ,though I would say to do this on a separate page to keep all the notes for maths together then the practice questions separate, so you can easily look them over on the day.


For Spanish I wrote down all of the words I didn't know (there should be a vocab list for your exam board online somewhere) and then made flashcards on my phone in an app called Cram which I would highly recommend, not only for Spanish but also other subjects. Then just keep redoing these until you know them, this should allow you to get full UMS on the reading easily if you know them. But for the listening it might be harder to do as well but you should still be okay if you do this, again, if you learn them.

For English if your mock is English Language then I would highly recommend a YouTube channel called ""The English Teacher"" which a lot of people in my school, including myself used to learn the structures for the different types of written questions that could appear. If the exam is literature then you could also use that channel but I can't vouch for whether it is helpful or not as I didn't use it. For literature I would just be sure to know the texts inside out and perhaps prepare for some essays that you think may come up (our teacher gave us a few characters who she felt could come up.)

Most, if not all Muslim terror attacks in the UK have come from groups that are small and isolated. So what if they destroy a major power station or military base, there aren't thousands of other Islamic terrorists waiting for the opportunity to strike. 

Islamic terrorists gain the most from attacks that gain a lot of publicity, in order to propagate their ideology and hopefully recruit more to the cause (which, as I pointed out earlier, many agree doesn't actually work, but that doesn't stop many across the political spectrum from trying). A terror attack in a crowded street is more likely to make and stay in headline news than an attack on important infrastructure that ends with few causalities, so that's why they attack civilians.

I think it's mainly because we are very dependent on the defensive midfield pairing that we have. That was disproved, of course, with Matic's suspension, but because he took such a responsibility at the back it meant Cesc could have a greater influence ahead of play when we were in possession.

It's because they compliment eachother so brilliantly that we seem to always make the most of our possession compared to most teams. There aren't many players these days that are mostly defensive minded. If you consider City with Fernandinho and Arsenal and someone like Ramsey, their function is to contribute with both the transition between defence and attack (box to box), however we have a pairing that have evidently know exactly what individual jobs they have, whether it is beginning an attack, or being the line of defence in front of the back four.

 'Animals on the line', and 'delay on a previous train' somehow get dragged out for hours upon hours, and they play a wonderful game where they only ever delay it for 5 minutes at a time, so you end up standing at the platform for hours like a complete twerp when you could have gone and got something to drink.

'The door came off the train, so we're going to stop for 1.5 hours and then we'll crawl to the next station at 5mph, wherein you'll all be deposited and then have to get onto an already-overbooked train that departed 2 hours after the one you were on' is another good one. That's probably my record.

Another favourite of mine is 'there was a landslide on the line and it will take 3 months to clear it' or 'the line between leamington and banbury is out for a completely different reason and we didn't notify you even though your return was booked for today'. 

Not to mention, most of them are so overbooked that there's more people in the aisle and standing outside the toilets than in the seats. It doesn't matter that I book seats anymore, I can't bloody walk down the aisle to get to them.

Oh, and the trip is £80 with a railcard. I guess it's not so bad if I look at it 'per hour'. I could upgrade to first class for an additional £220, I suppose, that way I could get into one of the many almost-empty first class carriages at the start of my hours-delayed train, if it ever gets to the station at all, if there even is a rail link between my station and the next; if not, I shall get a first-class bus. I will tell the driver to stop blasting radio 1, because I'm someone important, and a little man will come down the aisle and offer me a biscuit, which I think is how first-class works.

My local rail station was a victim of the Beeching cuts. If I need to get a train from my parents house (in the midlands), I need to borrow their car anyway, because the nearest train station is 30 minutes by car, and the buses barely run anymore. However, I take solace in the fact that HS2 is going to go right past that house, so close that they'll probably be able to feel the breeze as the trains shoot back and forth, to and from London, the center of the known universe and the only real place in Britain.

Same reason road tax can be used to repair roads that you'll never use, or how it costs the same whether you drive 10 or 5000 miles a month.

I'm not saying that is necessarily the case, but I'm just pointing out that we need to more carefully decide whether this is a luxury or not.

In theory, not having to worry about funding means that a news station can operate freely, without worry about trying to attract an audience etc. The other obvious model to choose is a subscription model, but then we have issues where currently the TV license does work like a tax. It funds the radio + website, and you can't currently put a subscription on radio. So now some people are paying for others to use BBC radio stations. On top of that, it now has to actually target audiences to make sure it's showing stuff that attracts subscribers. Which means they need to focus on advertising their services etc.

The latter can be seen in printed news sources which try to use catchy titles and headings to try to catch attention rather than actually tell news.

I used Squawka for the most part, Wikipedia for the rest. I'm not a statistical expert, nor have I watched a lot of matches with either person present. I understand that stats are considered a 'money-ball' approach to football, but numbers also don't lie and can show a true side to someones 'goals per season' if they have a lot of penalties, etc so I think it's fair to look at both sides of the discussion.

We've done well in the transfer window so far, have faith boys.

The hard part comes when you want to look at each of those matches individually.

In the middle of the page you will see all the different coloured rectangles (green, yellow, red, some with crosses etc) these are the matches for Benteke in the 14/15 season. 

The last 10 from the right is what you'll be looking at - click into each of those, then click on Benteke on the right and it will show you his performance score, but up the top in grey you will see his own performance (you should see Shots 2, 85% passing, 3 chances created, etc etc).

Yet, so many of you clamoring to prove that Benteke is exactly what we need because he's young. We've seen what too many youngsters got us last year. Then you say he's PL proven. I've given several names whom we bought for PL experience and do how they failed.

I'm sorry but what? Surely we want players to be in their peak? Remember when Man United signed Van Persie when he was 29 and proceed to win the league because of him?

Also, we have Ings and Origi to fill the roles of leading the line in the future.
Right now, we need someone who can make an immediate impact and can be relied on to score goals.

One thing people tend to forget when defending Benteke is that he has had big injury problems in the last couple of years. We need a reliable striker and Benteke is just not that man (and especially not for £32m or even £25m).

One, it's unknowable whether Baker will play for Chelsea's first team. He's young and most of us haven't seen him play very much in the last year. This loan to Vitesse is a chance to find out where he is. The Dutch league isn't great, but it does allow attacking players to shine. It's possible he'll have an impact. Only last season Bertrand Traore went on a scoring rampage for Vitesse and now he may be Chelsea's hottest prospect.

The second is that, as you say, the odds are very, very slim that any particular youth player will ever play for Chelsea's senior team. The club scours the globe looking for the world's best players. Any youngster will have to break into a team staffed by superb players. Very, very difficult to do.

tl;dr All we can do is wait and see. :-)

So if you're considering Oxbridge, Edinburgh, London, St. Andrews, etc. then A-levels are more likely to get you in.

Otherwise, I'd go for an Access course; it's a year long (two if part-time), is aimed at people returning to education and you'll get advice and support for your uni application. Many colleges offer courses in various disciplines (Humanities, Science, Social Science, Health, etc.); the site www.accesstohe.ac.uk has all the info and a database to find courses close to you.

null,false,TBHNA-Joyful,null,null,null,"&gt; All in all Tesco have only themselves to blame for their position. 

To be fair, the market and Tesco's main customer segment has changed a lot in the past decade.  The more well-off never stopped going to Waitrose and M&amp;S, the poor never stopped going to Aldi/Lidl/Iceland/Asda, but the 'middle' ground - those who would almost always have shopped at Tesco, Morrisons or Sainsbury's have changed dramatically.

The more affluent of the middle ground are buying from less profitable streams such as home delivery. 

With wages stagnant for the lower classes, the people who would have ""promoted"" to mid-range stores have not had the opportunity to do so and remain with the lower tiers.

Rather than going mainly to the middle range stores and to the top end every now and again, with wages stagnant in the middle, many have gone from mid-tier stores most of the time to being split between the low end for many things and the high-end because, lets face it, the food sold by (and the other people shopping in) Iceland/Lidl et. al is atrociously bad and one would be suicidal if they didn't experience something positive.

With people spending more as a portion of income on housing (i.e. renters in the south paying &gt;35% of wages), there is also less budget for groceries, forcing Tesco and their ilk into running deals and competing on price with ""2for1"" and ""this would have cost you 5p more in &lt;other store&gt;, here is a 5p voucher you'll never use off your next shop"" gimmicks to give the appearance of value to a segment who would otherwise go elsewhere.

That said, I am also in favour of our current gun laws, which would surely put me at odds with people who would consider themselves more strictly libertarian, especially in America where such ideas are so widespread.

It's similar when Ireland did this with a personal trainer. It didn't really convert into good form.

Having said that though, Vinnie as a professional athlete is likely to know his own body better than I. 

Hopefully he gets back to decent form this year; he needs to adjust his style to be a bit more conservative in his approach to defending, and let the players around him do their jobs.

If the conviction rate was over 60%, it suggests to me the bar for prosecution was too high, and today's conviction rate of 57% is *better*, not worse.

Gittos seems to think that means too many innocents are being prosecuted, apparently having elided the difference between the legal presumption of innocence and the reality of the circumstances. But it seems obvious that, unless we only prosecute in cases where the person is literally caught red-handed, by dozens of witnesses, video, fingerprints, DNA etc, a large proportion of people will be acquitted (indeed ~49%) whether or not they in fact dunnit.

Hence my snark.

Okay, so no one would object to more attention and investment in tackling and diagnosing mental health issues. I don't think you're wrong insofar as you say there are people who are unemployed because of actual conditions and problems. 

The questionable nature if this I and others find is the connection of DWP to mental health. The unemployed becoming a mold with which to shape psychologically, and there's the shift from external factors, which are contingent (bad economy etc.) toward blaming the individual. Between that and the tying of self-worth to jobs it's not psychologically helpful at all! It shifts the conversation from ""What is wrong with our society at this moment in time, what are our problems?"" to ""what are YOUR problems?"" Even charities like Mind like to cite studies from australia claiming the benefits of work for you as a person. Yet the strange thing is no one would deny activity is good, but for extrinsic things like that to be tied to your character, well, we get a problem when crises hit. 

The medicalisation of unemployment would be treating people who are unemployed as a unique category, an objective one, which with the right objective psychological/medical handling will be back on their feet. It shifts the focus onto the bodies of unemployed people, to be treated and interrogated. Unemployment ceases to be an economic problem, with which the govt is partly responsible for, to again, the individual. Which is sometimes but not always the case, certainly not enough to justify such a shift in political discourse.

The famous rand corporation simulated war game that resulted in all f35s being obliterated by Russian and Chinese rival platfroms was undertaken by ex us combat aviators. 
Think about it. The US needs air fighter aircraft, ground attack and fighter bombers. These roles are all currently undertaken by platforms designed specifically for the role.
Fighter- twin engine f15
Fighter bomber- single engine f16
Ground attack- twin engine a10 
Stovl- harrier av8.

The different branches of the US military that operate these platforms all wanted the same capability and the Lockheed tried making a platform that undertakes all these roles, a universal aircraft.
Only problem is, that the f35 fighter bomber is single engine and outclassed as an fighter, it can't turn, climb or run faster than a dedicated twin engine fighter like a su 30.
It can't do damage like a an a10 or loiter like an a10.
It can't replace the f15 as a fighter or thenthe f16 as a bomber as its stealth capabilities mean it must use its internal bomb bay, which means it carries fewer bombs than  an f16.
It's a jack of all trades and a master of none

Volvo, I'm sure entirely coincidentally, make HGV's and Buses. When cyclists die, usually getting pulled under an HGV turning left, we hear about HGV drivers' 'blind spot'. A light up system is of little or no additional benefit in daylight and of no benefit at all if the cyclist is already entirely obscured from view.


To make a (deliberately ridiculous) counter example- Perhaps Volvo could market testosterone injections for female cyclists to make them more like men so that they would then be far less likely to be killed cycling on London's streets. Then, just as with this 'life paint' everyone can blame the victims for their misfortunes and avoid changing any aspect of their own approach to the problem.

Is it possible that they're getting caught up in politics, much in the same way that the Police Federation has, in cooking the books to help justify their funding level?

All this brought about by the climate of fear that must exist in every publicly funded organisation, given the government's obsession with cutting public spending.

I would imagine that a rape trial would be a criminal prosecution? with a jury?  In which case the criteria is different, apparently. (my emphasis):

It means that a jury or bench of magistrates, or judge hearing a case alone, properly directed and acting in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the alleged charge. *This is a different test from the one that the criminal courts must apply.

It's like with the debate over gun control in the US.  Is every gun owner a potential spree-killer?  OF COURSE NOT!  But is easy access to guns a factor in the violence?  Sure thing.  And in the same way, I believe that Islam is a factor in the actions of groups like Islamic State without believing that every Muslim is a terrorist.

Well, that wasn't *my* point, to be fair. My point was about Gittos's apparent notion that all acquitted defendants are innocent and therefore shouldn't have been prosecuted.

&gt; Surely we rely on the CPS, as part of our legal system, to be honest and open about how they operate?

I don't see that they've been dishonest, but I haven't yet read the documents Gittos complains about but regrettably neglects to link to. I wouldn't want to convict someone without considering the evidence.

The British Parliament remains legally sovereign and the states in the US are therefore in a much better position than our devolved governments. 

That being said, in reality it would be untenable for the UK government to trample over devolution settlements - I'm merely saying in a legal sense they can, whereas in the US they can't.

Without wishing to reveal who I work for we are actually incentivising customers to rearrange their travel plans rather than outright cancel the holiday as then we would have to give customers a full refund which obviously we don't want to have to do.

I can only assume that your family members are travelling after 2nd July? In which case they should have waited for their travel company to contact them rather than change the plans themselves straight away, as the companies are dealing with customers who are travelling to Tunisia in a phased manner otherwise the numbers of people they would be dealing would be impossible to manage. 

They would have been offered an alternative destination and probably actually given some money to take that option, more than likely on Monday. Even still I'm surprised they were charged and would urge you to get them to contact the travel company (probably in a few days rather than now) to ascertain why they where charged, if you speak to the correct people I'm sure they could get that money refunded, unless they rearranged to go to a hotel that was better rated/more expensive than the one they originally booked, in which case, I can see why they would be charged some extra money (even then I'm still surprised). 

Edit: Just noticed it's not actually 2nd July but customers travelling up to the 24th July, so even more questioning of why they where charged £400 as this is not what the company are doing.

null,false,bruce_mcmango,null,null,null,"You're right in that violence and aggression can be found in most streams of healthcare. For me, it's one of the absolute worst parts of the job and absolutely corrosive to the essence of the doctor-patient relationship. 

You're right that a patient delirious from an illness could 'lash out'. You see it often ranging from the demented elderly confused and frightened on a ward to the drunks and junkies in A+E, furious that in saving their life by reversing their opiate overdose that you have taken away their high. 

The difference between those environments is that they are more able to handle that behaviour. You shout for help and somebody is just across the curtain for you. Your nursing staff are trained in chemically/physically restraining patients if necessary. There are security guards in A+E. In a GP consulting room, it is just you and the patient and they are often sitting between you and the door. Your staff are other GPs and receptionists. If you shout out, there is no guarantee anyone can even hear you. Some practises have panic buttons. 

The other difference is that someone having a stroke who is confused, frightened and 'lashing out' is not personally targeting the medic who happens to be treating them. The OP in this question had a relationship with his GP, knew them and made specific threats. It would still be bad if he said 'I'm going to kill all doctors' but it's more likely he said in his psychosis 'I'm going to kill *my* GP'.

Personally speaking, violence, aggression and intimidation from my patients are one of the things I fear most in my job. One of my colleagues did a house visit on a psychotic patient and was knocked unconscious by then because the patient believed they were the devil. He could easily have been killed. These things happen. If they were to happen to me I don't think I could carry on practising medicine. This is why it is so importance to have a zero tolerance attitude to violence.

I would assume any challenge to gay marriage bans here would be on Human Rights Act grounds - it's not ultra vires, it's not in contravention of EU Law so a HRA challenge would be most likely. The difficulty is that the European Court of Human Rights has consistently refused to rule that the convention requires states to allow gay marriage. Given that the HRA only incorporates the convention into domestic law and that judges here are reluctant in the extreme to go further than the convention demands, such a challenge is likely to fail in the domestic courts. Of course, I would think when the issue comes in front of the European court again it might go the other way but that would take almost a decade unless a similar case is working its way up already. 

Also, I posted above about how the UK Parliament can, technically, force through such a law which answers your question.

Also, state laws cannot contravene the Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court found that Amendment 14 of the constitution said, inter alia, that states must licence gay marriages.

The article pretends to be concerned with crime against women but then jumps straight into rape and tries to pass it off as not being a problem because it's all down to changes in the way that the crime is reported but that simply isn't even close to true:

http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_392380.pdf

No matter how you spin it, reported rape cases are up and it's not purely due to historical cases, the increase of 22% between 2013 and 2014 was 73% due to new cases.

Also, it is massively disingenuous to say that:

&gt; This means more innocent people have been prosecuted for rape than ever before

When we know that there are huge problems around getting a conviction for rape *which is one of the reasons the CPS is releasing this policy*. Yes, it might mean that more innocent people are being taken to court but given what we know about the problem we coul equally say it shows that the problems within the CPS and criminal justice system around prosecuting rapists are worse than ever. (Before someone gets faux outraged, I wouldn't assume any individual is a rapist regardless or trial results, we're talking about systematic problems in criminal prosecution that have been acknowledged for years and years).

null,false,GetKenny,eng-sussex,South Saxon,null,"&gt; The numbers of rapes (24,043) and other sexual offences (48,934) are the highest recorded
by the police since 2002/03. As well as improvements in recording, this is thought to reflect a
greater willingness of victims to come forward to report such crimes.

From your source. ^

&gt;The increase in police recorded rape offences follows a trend that began after the Jimmy Savile affair in 2012, when more sexual abuse victims felt empowered to report what had happened to them.

&gt;It also reflects changes in police procedures after some forces were criticised for wrongly chalking off rape allegations - a practice known as ""no criming"".

&gt;But it is unclear whether the increase is also partly due to a real rise in rape and no clues are offered by the Crime Survey, which doesn't ask people if they have been victims of sexual offences.

&gt;However, statisticians were clear that a 48% rise in knife-point rapes is not due to different recording methods but is likely to be ""genuine"".

&gt;Even though the number of such offences is relatively small, that is a real concern - and something that is not currently well understood.

&gt;Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said alleged rape victims were now more willing to come forward than in the past.

&gt;He added: ""We've improved the police recording of these terrible crimes and consequently we're now seeing an official increase.""

&gt;Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""These figures show a shocking failure to help rape victims and bring dangerous criminals to justice.""

**Duty to inform**

If your employer intends to monitor emails or internet use, it should inform you it intends to do so. This could be done in your employment contract or employee handbook, or some other kind of workplace email policy.

The policy should:

* set out clearly the circumstances in which you may or may not use work email and internet for private communications;
* make clear the extent and type of private use that is allowed;
* explain why your employer monitors emails, the extent of the monitoring, and the means used;
* outline how the policy is enforced and the penalties you can expect if you breach the policy;
* inform you of the extent to which information about your internet access and emails is retained in the system and for how long.

Note, provided you receive adequate notice, your employer may implement a blanket ban on using the internet or email for non-work related purposes. This is quite rare, however.

**Emails your employer may monitor**

The [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents) prohibits intentional ""interception"" of emails without ""lawful authority"". As a general rule, this means employers cannot read an email without the consent of both the sender and recipient.

The [Telecommunications (Lawful Business Practice) (Interception of Communications) Regulations 2000](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/2699/contents/made) lists a number of exceptions to this general rule, however, which include intercepting business emails to:

* ascertain regulatory compliance;
* detect unauthorised use; and
* prevent/detect criminal activity.

Note, however, these exceptions do not apply to personal emails, which means your employer should take all reasonable measures to avoid opening them -- even those sent from a workplace email account.

Your employer should confine itself to looking solely at the address/heading of your business emails unless it is absolutely essential for a valid and defined reason to examine the content (e.g., to prevent a crime). Moreover, to minimise intrusion, employers should as far as practicable utilise automated systems to monitor email.

If you are allowed to access your personal email account at work, your employer may monitor such emails only in exceptional circumstances (e.g., to investigate criminal activity).

If you think that your employer has illegally monitored your emails or wants to discipline you for improper email use, you should seek expert legal advice as a matter of priority.

**Data protection**

Under the [Data Protection Act 1998](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents), if your employer monitors your use of email and collects personal data about you, it must tell you how it intends to use the information and use only for that purpose. Section 13 of the Act allows you to claim compensation for any contravention of the statute that causes you injury of distress.

__________________________________________________

IANAL but I did once accompany and support a colleague to a disciplinary hearing where they pulled up her email history to use as evidence - this was for a big company though where the policy clearly stated that all emails belong to the company. Your friend's case where there is no policy (so has the employer failed in their 'duty to inform' re: monitoring?) is more vague and I am not qualified enough to speculate.

I would advise though that when using a work email for a private purpose you treat it as a 'public' computer and be extremely careful not leave sensitive personal information easily accessible - assume anything might come up in a potential future 'investigation'.",null,0,null,1435405141,null,0,1435406555,0,cskesux,null,t3_3ba9sz,null,t1_cskesux,null,t3_3ba9sz,null,null,null,1437389495,null,5,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,5,null

Also, should probs say, if you choose to do nothing, you will not get your excess back and your premiums may be effected, because your insurer essentialy loses the money it could have claimed back and will blame you for this.

The Conservatives have 330 + 227 = 557 or 38.8% of seats. Their popular vote share was 37%.

Labour have 232 + 212 = 444 or 30.9% of seats. Their popular vote share was 30.4%. 

SNP have 50 + 0 = 50 seats or 3.5% of the seats. Their popular vote share was 4.7%.

Of course seats in the House of Lords are not as important as seats in the Commons so what we really need is a PR system for the Commons.

Also the Independent must have got their maths wrong, they say ""The Green Party has only one peer, though a proportional system would give them 21. The SNP would be entitled to 46, but has none. The Lib Dems, by contrast, would be entitled to 44, rather than their 102 and rising."" I have no idea how they think the SNP would have more seats than the Lib Dems in a proportional system when the Lib Dems got nearly twice the number of votes.

null,false,dindane,lfc68,,null,"I agree with most of what you said, especially how hard the loss of Gerrard will hurt us. He was a huge influence on the team, and even though most people seem to think he was shit last season, he still saved our ass numerous times. However, I disagree with your comparing the loss of Suarez with the soon to be loss of Sterling. 

Suarez was top goalscorer and top assist maker in the league. Probably the 3rd best player in the world that season. Sterling had 7 goals 7 assists last season, and he flunked fuck loads of chances. You would expect the new player that we are bringing in to play in the position that Sterling played for the majority of last season (striker) to easily surpass those numbers, rendering the loss of Sterling relatively insignificant, which losing Suarez was never going to be, as he is irreplaceable. Also, we have ready made replacements for Sterling already at the club ( Firmino, who is better than Sterling anyway,Markovic, Ibe, for the winger position he played, and we will most likely be signing one of: Benteke, Bacca, Rondon), whereas when we lost Suarez we expected his replacements to be Sturridge, Balo, Lambert. Sturridge was obviously injured all season, so having Balo and Lambert as replacements for the 3rd best player in the world clearly wasn't going to work.

 As for the holes in the squad, if we get Clyne and the new striker, then our squad is actually extremely well rounded. We would have 2 top quality strikers in Sturridge and the new striker, as well as good backups in Origi and Ings (Possibly Lambert, but Borini and Balo are surely gone). Wingers/Attacking midfielders we are pretty damn stacked with aswell (Coutinho, Firmino, Lallana, Markovic, Ibe,) Central mids also (Lucas, Hendo, Allen, Milner, Can). 

Defense is probably the least stacked, but still a decent amount of depth, but not as much quality depth (Skrtel, Sakho, Lovren, Kolo, Gomez, Wisdom for cbs. Clyne (i hope) flanno, Manquilo, Wisdom for rbs.  Moreno, Enrique lbs (If Enrique leaves as expected we definitely need another lb). 

Personally I believe our squad is definitely on par with United's (atm at least). Personally I believe that if the rest of our transfer window goes as expected, then we really ought to be strongly challenging for the top 4, and if we don't then I would place a lot of the blame on Rodgers, as this is actually a very good squad. Holy crap that was more than I thought I would write.

Your assertion that there's ""work to be had"" - are you aware that the state effectively subsidises a number of employers?

Suarez was, in the 2013-14 season, arguably the most dominant player on the planet. Sterling is a very talented youngster who  didn't have the greatest season (although he was still one of our better players) and can be replaced. Suarez left to form one third of arguably the best attack ever assembled. 

  This summer's business is cumulative to last summer's. Although we lost Suarez, we added greater depth last summer. Not all of the signings worked out, but when you add Markovic, Lallana, Moreno, Can and Lovren (who are all guaranteed to stay with us) to the signings we have made so far this summer, it's obvious that the squad as a whole is stronger than it has been for a while. 

  We are in the process of looking for a quality striker, and we still have Sturridge. Nobody expected him to feature so little last year - he had a run of bad luck with injuries, and while fitness is always likely to an issue for him, it's unlikely that he'll have such a bad run of injuries next season. 

  Our aim for next season is to compete with Man Utd, Arsenal and Spurs for the third and fourth spot and to try to win one of the domestic cups and the Europa league. A title challenge would be a pleasant surprise. With our new signings, with last season's fresh faces having bedded in properly, with Ibe emerging as a legitimate first team player, and with whichever signings we make later in the summer, our aims are eminently achievable.

Wouldn't compare Sterling's departure to Suarez's, firstly. That's a huge aspect in terms of season turnover. Sterling had a pretty good yet inconsistent season, Suarez had a record breaking, transcendent season. Replacing Suarez's production was near impossible tbh, Firmino by himself could quite possibly replace or even improve upon Sterling's production.

In terms of significant holes, we're looking at ST &amp; RB, right? Maybe DM w/ Lucas' injuries and uncertainties whether Can is ready for that role. Those seem to be the major concerns. Clyne seems to be an almost done deal so that would be that with RB, I'm certainly confident he could do the job for us, he did do it for one of the best defenses last season. ST would be the more concerning bit, but we're lacking viable options in the market tbqh. I like Benteke although many seem not to, I think he could add another dimension to our play while also being able to play into our current style as well. Bacca possibly too, regardless though, it does seem that the club will be signing a first choice ST whether it's one of these two or another. Now if we went into the season w/ let's say Benteke/Sturridge/Ings/Origi, I'd find it hard not to be content with that. 

I can see where the comparison comes in, but I think we have more balance in our signings so far. First team quality in Firmino/Milner/Clyne, experience in Milner/(likely 1st choice ST), potential in Gomez/Ings &amp; we're not done.

I think the slip and missing narrowly out on the title was it for him here. I don't think he had the energy or the motivation to be captain fantastic anymore. He carried the club for 10 years and I'm not surprised he couldn't find the drive to do it again after how that shit unfolded last season. 

He was very poor last season, targeted by other teams and generally playing to a lot worse extent than just one season prior. All these interviews he's given about how he thinks about the slip everyday etc, scream to me his heart wasn't here last season. 

Our best run of results and performances came when he wasn't playing, and we near enough forfeited the FA cup semi by playing him. He was invisible, and lasted the entire game. 

Him announcing mid season that he was leaving obviously isn't ideal for the squad with pressure of a farewell tour, and then when he was getting (understandably) shoe-horned into playing at the end of the season, it sacrificed any hope we had of catching the top four or winning a trophy. 

We'd already lost him last season, we just didn't know it yet. I think the opposite will happen this year now. 

As much of a legend as he is, he needed to accept a lesser role at the squad now, or retire/move. Without the pressure of doing it for Stevie or trying to shoe-horn him in we're free to play to our strengths now. 

We'll miss his leadership, but hopefully people will pick up the responsibility now. I trust they will. 

I also completely disagree about Sterling. Suarez is an absolute monster of a player. He raises the game of everyone around him and is truly incredible. Sterling is a great prospect, but I wouldn't even call world class, he's not even in the top 10 players in the league really. Suarez would be comfortably top.

null,false,Zmod,null,null,null,"&gt;Suarez was top goalscorer and top assist maker in the league. Probably the 3rd best player in the world that season. Sterling had 7 goals 7 assists last season, and he flunked fuck loads of chances. You would expect the new player that we are bringing in to play in the position that Sterling played for the majority of last season (striker) to easily surpass those numbers, rendering the loss of Sterling relatively insignificant, which losing Suarez was never going to be, as he is irreplaceable. Also, we have ready made replacements for Sterling already at the club ( Firmino, who is better than Sterling anyway,Markovic, Ibe, for the winger position he played, and we will most likely be signing one of: Benteke, Bacca, Rondon), whereas when we lost Suarez we expected his replacements to be Sturridge, 

He fucked like 5 chances didn't he? hardly a fuck load. Anyway you're failing to take into account he only played striker for half the season and he made a LOT of chances for us this season, more than anyone else in our team.. averaging 2.22 a game is pretty impressive and up their with some of the best in the Prem. For some perspective he has made more chances than Coutinho over the last 2 seasons and that's with him being played out of position for 15 games of the season just gone..

People would not be saying Firmino is better than Sterling if he played in the Prem and/or was English. The guy only scored 3 goals from open play in the Bundesliga this season in 33 games, that is very poor. They're on a similar level, one is not really better than the other. But people always underrate English players and overrate Brazilian players so what's new.

&gt;Why do white working class children underachieve in schools?

&gt;MPs on the education select committee delivered the verdict that they are ""consistently the lowest performing group in the country"".

&gt;It matters a lot - as Ofsted boss Sir Michael Wilshaw says - because this is the biggest single group of underperformers.

The report itself by the government is [here](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmeduc/142/142.pdf). If you go to the Conclusion on Page 62 you can see that they conclude from the evidence:

&gt;On average, poor white  children tend to perform at a much lower level in education than their more affluent peers, and at a lower level than many similarly economically-deprived children of other ethnicities. Meanwhile, the economy has changed in recent decades; while underachievement in education may once have led to a lifetime of employment in traditional routine manual occupations in factories, the consequence now is more likely to be “NEET” status.

Do you just want these children to be forced into poverty in revenge for the way their elders behave? Is that the way you think? That they have a kind of 'original sin' inherited from the people *actually* responsible for perpetuating the discriminatory social attitudes and practices in our society? Or is it just that you don't think extra help should be given to anyone who isn't a minority? I'm struggling to see what exactly your problem is here.

I'm aware that racism is still pretty widespread in the UK, particularly against the Asian community IMO, and if I had my way we'd have a huge purge of the Met to try and get to the root of their institutional racism. But the problem here is that you're not even well-versed in identity politics, let alone the more ignorant mainstream conception of identity-related issues. If you'd spent any time at all learning about this you would surely have come across the idea of intersectionality, which shows us that it isn't as simple as saying that 'because someone is white they are therefore more privileged than someone who is not in a western European country.' You have to take into account things like gender, nationality, economic status and class as well, which you have entirely failed to do. ""White"" on its own is not a ""class"", because you can (and *must*) then subdivide that class into the aforementioned factors that intersect in different ways. Rich, cis, able-bodied, straight, white English males? Sure, privileged *as fuck*. Poor, disabled, LGBT+, Polish males? Yeah, *maybe not*. It's way more complex than just ""White? You must be the most privileged in society then.""

This is the problem with spending too much time listening to and participating in social justice-related discussions with Americans: Social justice is a *great* thing, and I make it a point to automatically block anyone who uses the term 'SJW', but Americans have a *very* different conception of race and nationality than Europeans and British people do, and a lot of their theory and discourse just doesn't directly translate here. Polish and Roma generally have white skin, but the way they're treated and discriminated against because of who they are is very different to how black people are discriminated against in the US because of *their* skin colour. How do you feel about the way white Eastern Europeans are treated and stereotyped in this country? Must they be thankful for the ""privilege"" of their Slavic ethnicity when in Britain that results in them being treated pretty terribly? 

You've lumped everyone into the ""white community"", which is bullshit - there is no such thing as the ""white community"", just as there is no such thing as ""the black community"", or even really ""the muslim community""; there are just communities and individuals who happen to have different skin colours. And not only that, but once you generalised to include everyone of the same 'white' skin colour, you then decided that children and adults are the same thing too.",null,0,null,1435407643,null,0,1435407881,0,cskfenm,null,t3_3bajy6,null,t1_cskfenm,null,t1_cskf1yv,null,null,null,1437389613,null,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16,null

Sterling isn't anywhere near as important to us, Suarez had a much bigger impact on the season as a whole and Sterling was generally off form for the latter part of the season. 

As for the signings we've made signings that are much more proven this year. Milner is very experienced and reliable, Ings has a lot of potential and suits us, Clyne will be started RB, Firmino had been brilliant at Hoffenheim and Bogdan is just a backup. Last season we only really Lallana and Lovren who were expected to show much. 


&gt; * The fans' opinion of what the team is capable of becomes inflated by the new signings (hopes we could challenge without Suarez last season, hopes we will get fourth this season while the memory of the limp performances in the final few weeks of the season slowly fade).

This always happens and always will, I honestly never expected us to challenge last season and top four was always going to be the most important thing. Same applies to this season, we wont be winning it but getting top four is what we should be aiming for. 


&gt; * The team is crying out for quality signings in certain positions which doesn't really get addressed until later on in the window and eventually doesn't get resolved. Early signings are seen as 'good for depth and cup games'.


Apart from a forward I haven't really seen anyone mentioning this.


&gt; * People start overlooking the significant holes in the squad if outgoing transfers go as planned: Sterling and Gerrard. The new players signed must be balanced against what we are losing; Gerrard still had a huge influence on the squad (I know some people will argue that, but I believe it to be true), Sterling is probably a £25m deficit we have to cover before we can think of the new signings as positives. All talk of Sterling being a loss has quietened recently but it will be felt in the squad.

Right back is sorted, another creative midfielder is sorted, forward options are getting sorted, another left back is getting sorted. Gerrards influence has been purely from his experience and his name, his ability to affect play on the pitch has been waning for a while. As for Sterling we have Markovic who will hopefully get moved further forward, Ibe who's been improving massively, Lallana, Coutinho, Firmino, Milner and honestly he's not been brilliant this season anyway. He'll be a tough loss but hardly replaceable.


Plus Can is turning into a bit of a beast in midfield.

We know what Coutinho can do with a mobile forward in front of him. Bacca's strength is his ability to run thru channels. Even in the scout nation videos you can see he'll be running into a thru ball and he may look behind the defenders, but he takes this weird angles to be these defenders. Once he gets the ball he is deadly in the box. His age is not an issue for me. Having just signed Origi and Ings, when Bacca is exiting his prime, they will be entering theirs. It'd be pretty wasteful actually to get Benteke and bury those guys on the bench. Bacca also is a much better finisher than Benteke. He simply scores. Look at the conversion rate.

null,false,PacifisticJ,cnty-england,London,null,"&gt;In today's society, there aren't enough jobs that don't require degrees, and having a degree is helpful as we a very professionalised nation, but there is also the problem that gradually jobs are being eroded. 

Yup, university is an investment. You pay in hoping you get something out of it, hoping you get better job prospects. 

&gt;Studies have proved there is still the stigma and barriers to education for the poor that there have always been, the fees increase this. 

Whether the fees increase this problem isn't an argument against the increase of fees. I live in the poorest Borough in the country. The problem is, some of the poorer students don't know about how uni fees work. It's clear that the increase in tuition fees isn't a hindrance to poorer students attending uni. This study tells us there has to be better guidance regarding education. I'm from a working class family, and I honestly don't think my financial situation was a hindrance. 

&gt;University is still education. It's not like some jolly - that's only if you make that happen outside of it. If you see education as a privilege, then that's fine. But I see it as a right. Not only is it important for the development of our citizens, but the good and proper running of the country of the future.

It's higher education, it's not mandatory, and it is a privilege. Some people who are still paying for my education haven't enjoyed the privileges themselves. Several privileges are better for our citizens and the development of country. Take transport as an example. Cars, trains, planes, which you all have to pay for, are privileges that help our society and social mobility. The fact that uni isn't mandatory and some people don't go to uni indicates that uni is an individual choice (that does benefit society) and you go to uni to increase your personal situation, not the situation of other people, and if you decide to go uni, you don't have to immediately pay, you pay for own education WHEN you can pay for it, and you pay a fair amount.

null,false,TVKMarkII,null,null,null,"No, last year we signed 1 signing who was a certain starter (Moreno). Then a couple more who were competition for first team (Lallana &amp; Lovren). Then the rest were either depth/plan Bs (Lambert, Balotelli, Manquillo) or looking to the future (Can, Origi, Markovic). 

We lost the best player in the league and arguably the 3rd best player in the world. A player who not only made himself look incredible, but everyone around him. We couldn't replace that talent, and even if we could, we didn't. 

This year: 3 immediate first team starters (Firmino, Milner &amp; Clyne). New depth in a position we're going to be clearing out (Ings) and a signing for the future (Gomez) and a new back up who is an upgrade to the last (Bogdan).

We're losing the most influential player in the league, but he's not the player he was. He still has his moments and I hate the fact he's gone, but Gerrard is not the Stevie of 05-09. He's tenacious and a leader but let's be honest, a lot of us didn't want him in the team most of last season in a CDM role, where he was mostly used. 

Sterling is by no means gone (see: Suarez in 2013) but if he does, so what? He's very good, but he's inconsistent and temperamental. He's not reached his potential yet so we can only judge him on what he is, and Firmino is by far the better player right now. Maybe in 3 years he'll be the best in the league, but it's as likely that he peaks now and slowly fades into obscurity. If we lose him, we lose a stroppy kid with great potential and we've already gained a fantastic player who has chemistry with Coutinho.

There's [one in the New York Times](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/whats-wrong-with-all-lives-matter/) that I think does a decent job of highlighting the problem in a very tactful way:

&gt;G.Y.: I’ve heard that some white people have held signs that read “All Lives Matter.”

&gt;J.B.: When some people rejoin with “All Lives Matter” they misunderstand the problem, but not because their message is untrue. It is true that all lives matter, but it is equally true that not all lives are understood to matter which is precisely why it is most important to name the lives that have not mattered, and are struggling to matter in the way they deserve.

&gt;Claiming that “all lives matter” does not immediately mark or enable black lives only because they have not been fully recognized as having lives that matter. I do not mean this as an obscure riddle. I mean only to say that we cannot have a race-blind approach to the questions: which lives matter? Or, which lives are worth valuing? If we jump too quickly to the universal formulation, “all lives matter,” then we miss the fact that black people have not yet been included in the idea of “all lives.” That said, it is true that all lives matter (we can then debate about when life begins or ends). But to make that universal formulation concrete, to make that into a living formulation, one that truly extends to all people, we have to foreground those lives that are not mattering now, to mark that exclusion, and militate against it. Achieving that universal, “all lives matter,” is a struggle, and that is part of what we are seeing on the streets. For on the streets we see a complex set of solidarities across color lines that seek to show what a concrete and living sense of bodies that matter can be.

null,false,bloop24,lfc99,,null,"imo this summer is very different from last.  last summer we signed 6 very young(18-20) players and 3 that were 25ish.  Lallana has been good when fit and has gotten almost the same amount of goals/assists as Coutinho with half the minutes played.  Lovren had a terrible start and Balotelli was always going to be a huge risk as he was obviously a panic buy at the very end of the window.  

This window we have so far signed 3 young players(Gomez, Ings, and Firmino), Milner who is very experienced and reliable, and Clyne who looks like pretty much a done deal at this point who is what 23 or 24? and was also one of the best fullbacks in the league for half the season.  We have also signed Bogdan who is never meant to be anything more than a backup and will likely never play in the league for us barring a very unlikely injury.  Firmino is proven at a high level and looks much better at the moment than any of our young signings from last window did when we signed them.  Clyne will slot directly into the first team as well as Firmino and Milner.  Sterling is also much much less crucial to our squad than Suarez was and is imo pretty much equal to Firmino as far as ability goes so that's a wash overall.  We bought depth last summer which is exactly what we needed to play in as many competitions as we were.  You say we need a proven goalscorer but the window hasn't even opened yet so there is plenty of time to sort that out and one of Bacca or Benteke looks likely to happen.  This summer so far we have added a little more depth and gotten some direct improvements to the first team.   We do have holes in the squad but they are only depth wise and I expect us to sign one more fullback this summer unless we plan on using Gomez as depth there or bringing someone currently on loan back as depth.  We also could use another DM but Rodgers doesn't seem to like pure DMs so I think we'll be stuck with only Lucas again.  

We had 2 signings that were meant to be upgrades to the starting 11 last summer and we've already made 3 so far this summer.  Milner&gt;Gerrard(last season) Clyne&gt;Johnson Firmino=Sterling but he's got better finishing than Sterling.  You'll have trouble convincing me losing Sterling is even close to the same as losing Suarez and having Sturridge injured all of last season.  He is just not nearly as important to us as Suarez was.

And finishing 6th is ALWAYS a disappointment since I always expect us to be challenging for champions league spots regardless of any transfers we make or how realistic that is at the time.

Lovren I can see it both ways. We paid a lot for him (especially as he's a defender) but then we did that with Sakho too. He was in theory a replacement for Agger, so whether you'd take that as him to be a first team starter or not I don't know.

He's got basically no finishing (in my opinion most of his goals are more down to luck than actual skill as far as hitting the ball goes), no decision making, nothing close to Neymar levels of dribbling (he controls the ball in a very weird way which is exploited by the bigger teams, that's one of the reasons he can't show up in big games), he's easily bullied off the ball and has anger issues. His only real strength is his pace, which I have to say he uses well.

And right now I'm not talking about potential. It simply doesn't matter in this case, as we are talking about his skill right now. Right now he wouldn't get into the starting 11 of teams above us. He can't get ahead of Sanchez, Walcott, Hazard, Willian, David Silva (when he's played as a winger), hell even Young at this point. The only one I'd see getting replaced by him is Navas and even that could be debateable. Realistically speaking he isn't a 50mil player. He's probably around the 20-25 million we paid for Markovic. And he's certainly not good enough, especially when he's 20 years old, to put himself above a club that's fighting for top4 and request astronomical wages or to be transferred because he believes he would play at those clubs.

Sterling would definitely get into City's team ahead of Navas on the wing, that's why they've bid £40m for him.. they're not paying that much for him to sit on the bench! Navas is nowhere good enough for City as seen by 1 goal in 42 games this season, they need someone better. 

Ibe is nowhere near as good as Sterling yet, he's literally all pace and nothing else. Whilst Sterling is one of the best passers in our 1st team and has pretty good decision making, why do you think there was such a big fiasco about him vs Rooney for England's CAM last season, it wasn't a joke..

Sterling isn't a £50m player, everyone knows that.

I agree he's quality, but he was not a nailed-on starter. Especially in the 4-3-3 BR prefers to play. He'd be challenging Sterling or Coutinho for one of the CAM/W roles. 

But his signing also illustrates a bigger point. We were very unlucky with injuries this season. Him &amp; Sturridge are arguably two of our best players when fit.

The our weakest defensive link in the team is actually Fabregas, who in position of MC has to track and mark players, but he is so awful at that. In other hand he did his assist magic so Oscar and Willian had to do the dirty work. 
If in that position we had someone more physical we could play Fabregas or Oscar upfront with less defensive responsibility, that's where goals come from. 
On the other hand. we lack crossers. Hazard is playing as inside forward, Willian stops play and plays the ball back in the middle, or waits for Ivanović. I do not like that.

The military didn't negotiate, they just stormed the facility and shut that shit down. The terrorists died and some of the hostages died as well. Forgien governments were pissed off that Algeria didn't bother consulting them or allow them to negiogate. That is how you deal with terrorists.

Tunisia had a different approach. For years they ignored the fact that thousands of young men were going to Syria to fight with jihadists. They ignored extremists groups openly organising themselves. They even ignored them when they were setting up bases on the borders. When extremists killed a politician they cracked down on them in the main cities but turned a blind eye to them in the border areas. It was only when Algeria got sick and tired of Tunisia being used as a safe haven to attack them when they started to something - half assed.

He can press, he's got a great work-rate, he can make clever runs, he can score goals.

Well, that's true. But it's way worse if your weakest link is strikers, central midfielders, centre backs or goal keeper than if your weakest link is your left fullback. Remember we almost won the league with  Flanagan and Johnson. And Moreno is weak but he's not a catastrophe.

But anyway, no one is suggesting it wouldn't be better to have another left fullback. The suggestion was that it's a low priority compared to striker, back-up keeper, right back, midfielder. 

It would be a smart approach to get recognised players everywhere on the pitch, again: priorities is what we're talking about. If we could take the 10m that we'd spend on another left back, I'd rather we use that money to get another striker.

On July 29, 2005, 25 guests were injured when one train rear-ended another and 15 guests were transported to local hospitals for treatment of minor injuries.

What I will say, is that whilst Firminio along with Markovic/Ibe could/should replace Sterling's contribution. There's no guarantee that they will, and even if they like for like replace, that still leaves us at the same quality as last season. Milner replacing Gerrard is similar (when despite Gerrard's form, his goal and assist contribution was still very good).
