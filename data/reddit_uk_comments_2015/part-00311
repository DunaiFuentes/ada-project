null,null,j035u5,null,null,null,"[This](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ending-addiction-good/201404/studies-show-long-term-effects-cannabis-the-brain) is quite a good and well sourced round up of some of the studies on the dangers of cannabis consumption.

Most notably these particular studies suggest that marijuana use creates physical changes in the brain associated with addiction, which goes against what most pot smokers, and particularly what legalisation campaigners will tell you. The other, perhaps more expected result these studies suggest is that particularly if you start young, or if you are a heavy user, you are provably causing physical changes in your brain, most notably in the areas that deal with motivation, emotion, and emotional learning.

These aren't the only studies either, I'm sure we've all heard of the links between cannabis ([particularly high THC low CBD strains](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00130/abstract)) and anxiety, schizophrenia, psychosis and depression. There is certainly an argument of cause and effect being the wrong way round in many instances but it is commonly accepted that people susceptible to these conditions are accelerated on their way by high THC low CBD cannabis.

I don't think anyone really refutes that cannabis use is harmful, but lots of things are harmful and we don't ban them all. The other argument is, does banning harmful activities make them less prevalent or safer, which most people would agree that it doesn't.

/u/hampa9 is correct that there are numerous studies showing that cannabis is less safe than many will tell you. It does the legalisation movement a disservice to ignore these issues. Whether or not these issues are more severe than the health issues from alcohol or tobacco isn't really up for debate though, both those legal substances are much worse for us.",null,0,null,1439384781,null,null,false,0,cu0bac0,null,t3_3glqo8,null,null,null,t1_ctzax4i,null,null,null,1440433411,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The company was originally owned by a family and was run brilliantly. If they needed repairs the contractors would appear within an hour, staff were well paid, and they had their pick of the crop when it came to staff.

It was eventually sold to Southern Cross who immediately tried to make the staff sign new contracts ending overtime payments (yet with clauses saying that they can be asked to work overtime at any stage, and can even be called in on their days off). They also hired people that magically disapperaed when HM Border Force turned up one day.

Southern Cross sold the home and it is owned by a single person who is just using it as a cash cow. They haven't had hot water for the entire summer as the boilers are broken, yet no money will be stumped for the repair. Staff are leaving in their droves, and the only people he tries to hire are dubiously qualified students. My mum says that this is common across the industry. Its awful. Its no wonder that she says that when she retires she plans to top herself as she doesn't want to be a burden, and will not go into a home.

Explanations, caveats and answers to common questions.

The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter. There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g. those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same. The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count. (See above for those figures)

Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured (I report them in the table when they are), however there is some regular measure of “underemployment” by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted. (See above for these figures)

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish. (See above for these figures) 

The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks. Those who are out of work and say they want a job but don’t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive. Note that the Inactive category is only for 16-64 year olds. (See above for these figures)

The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions. The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated. However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public. 

The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

The estimates presented are based on a survey and as such are subject to sampling error. The uncertainty in the estimate is captured by the 95% confidence interval e.g. the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is ± 0.2%. The numbers are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

Items highlighted with * have more recent data available, so I have used these data instead, and used the same offset for the historic columns to maintain comparability.

We only have limited cash. The whole reason for getting Berainho was so he could fill in the striker and winger roles if necessary. I've never been 100% on the Berainho bandwagon, but I think he's a quality player. Now, I can't imagine us getting a quality ST and a quality CM with our remaining cash. 

With Clinton, we've spent 29.4mil stering.  We've only sold 34.7mil sterling's worth of players. 

Now, say we sell Bobby for 10 and Lennon for 5 (obviously, these are guesses based on numbers bandied about). Then we'll have sold 50mil sterling, leaving us with 20 to spend. The club said it would be willing to put in up to 15mil (though, obviously, they want to save as much as possible for the stadium). That'd give us ~ 35 to spend. 

(I'm aware that this isn't a zero sum and all the money doesn't go out or come in at once; this is just to simplify the math.)

35mil isn't bad. But it won't buy us Berainho &amp; Bender. It wouldn't even get us Austin &amp; Illaramendi. It could get us Berainho and promising CM, but that's not what we need right now. We have promising CMs, we need experience. 

Now, if we hadn't got Clinton, we'd have ~45mil. That does get us Berainho and Bender.

The ability to disseminate the fact from fiction are the skills required to get a fuller understanding of an issue.

Maybe going:

Fazio ~£45k/w
Townsend ~£40k/w

-~£575k/w = -£29.9m/year           - ~-£440k/w ~£22.9m/year net

That's not even counting the possibility of Fazio and Townsend going, possibly another £15-20m going there so with Ade that *could potentially* rise another £20m+ which is more than enough. Veljkovic could cover CB, maybe even CCV. With N'jie, add another £30-40k/week, ~£1.5-2m total wages probably.

&gt;Now, I can't imagine us getting a quality ST and a quality CM with our remaining cash. 

Depends on the definition of ""quality"" but I wouldn't say Bera's quality yet.

The ""Ll"" sound isn't as hard as it may first seem. First, shape your mouth as if you were making an English ""L"" sound, so your tongue tip is behind your teeth. Then, flatten your tongue a little, so more of the body touches the roof of your mouth. Then, just hiss or blow. 

It's an unvoiced letter so that all you need. Just practice the sound, then try to say the word Llanelli, making the sound at the two correct places.

To get the cadence, it's worth noting that a lot of non Welsh people hear it and mispronounce it as ""Clan-ETH-ly"".

&gt;There’s more. Corbyn’s associations with anti-Semites include: his ‘friends’ Hamas and Hezbollah, his praise for a blood-libel-spreading, 9/11 conspiracy theorist Islamist preacher, who he even invited to take tea on the terrace of the House of Commons, moonlighting for George Galloway on Iranian government propaganda channel Press TV, allegedly donating money to a pressure group run by a holocaust denier and deemed too extreme by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, and defending a priest who shared on social media an article entitled ‘9/11: Israel did it’.

And he's due to be speaking at an event next month organized by MEMO.  [According to this blog-post:](https://cst.org.uk/news/blog/2015/07/08/jeremy-corbyn-and-antisemitism-questions-to-answer) 

&gt;MEMO has featured repeatedly on the CST Blog for peddling conspiracy theories and myths about Jews, Zionists, money and power. This has included questioning the suitability of Matthew Gould for the post of UK Ambassador to Israel simply because he is Jewish. MEMO also continued to spread the untrue story that the ‘Innocence of Muslims’ film was a Zionist plot to stir up hatred of Muslims, several days after it had been widely established that the film was made by Egyptian Christians.

Ireland is a part of the British Isles, so it is therefore British. I know it's a bit much for your edgy teenage brain to comprehend but people can identify as multiple nationalities.

The Swedish criminal justice system has different procedures to the UK's ones.

It isn't so much that they want to talk with him to find out what happened or get his side of the story, but that they have to carry out a formal meeting so they can finally charge him - and they'd rather do this in Sweden (where they can immediately take him into custody for pre-trial detention).

Think of it this way; someone in the UK is suspected of a crime. The police have a chat with him, and carry on their investigations. After a while, they have enough evidence to get an arrest warrant and turn up at his door to formally arrest and charge him.

- New players require time and energy to acquire with a fixed time budget for acquiring new players. With 3 weeks left in the window, and little work done to identify and court a player similar to Dembele, we would be leaving ourselves very little time to accomplish this

- New players require time to integrate into the squad.  This is true of any squad, but certainly true for the kind of squad that Poch is attempting to create.  He really does seem to prioritize doing things the ""right"" way and focusing on things like pace, fitness, pressure, etc.  If the player we were to replace Dembele with was not already a player with these qualities, we would be caught short for a period of time while we attempt to develop them in him.

- A new player is an unknown quantity.  Even the most surefire player can struggle in a new environment.

Wishful thinking on my part unfortunately. But still even so say no fee for Ade, £15m for Faz and Townsend so ~£35m to spend with sales (adding that on your £20m fee), £50m absolute max with the £15m spare. Say Embolo £14m, Yarmo £15m, leaving max £21m for a midfielder. Say the wages of N'jie, Embolo and Yarmo total ~£100-£125k/week giving about -£340k/w, £17.7m/year or ~-£315k/w, -£16.4m/year  wages reduced. Plenty of money left over for wages and maybe even a slightly higher transfer fee. It's more than doable if going for the risks and the players want to join obviously. If they pay off it's a master stroke, if they don't it's easy in hindsight.

&gt;And are you sure that someone like Hotlby was on 75k a week

Supposedly because of his situation with minimal fee giving him increased wages, but that's just from a bit of googling no idea how correct that is.

&gt;I can't imagine Townsend going for 15mil, either. I know Levy is Levy, but I've not seen any decent reporting to back up a number anywhere close to that. 

That was a bit optimistic on my part but I could see £10m - home grown england international who plays well for his country, had a bit of hype, 24, 2 or 3 years left on the contract. Given how people/media were hyping him under AVB they clearly didn't watch him so fingers crossed that happens again.

So, for a time, Hendo might have to sit a bit and lead when we play with that deeper double pivot without the ball.

That's what your persecution complex and your biased Wikipedia article tells you, but in reality the British Isles is used only as a term to describe the islands in the vicinity of the British mainland. Would you reject that Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba are not Caribbean Islands despite the fact that there exist multiple sovereign states within those islands?

Ireland is in the British Isles, it is therefore just as British as Wales, Scotland and England are. A tiny stretch of sea does nothing to change that.

Correlation does not infer causation. It is just as likely that in the *20 person study* the article refers to that the changes in grey matter predate the cannabis use and made the individuals more likely to use cannabis.

It's also worth noting that just-about anything will show noticeable effects on your brain if done regularly for a long period of time. Daily Caffeine use, daily chocolate eating, driving a vehicle for a living, having lots of sex daily, taking up a new sport... 

The link between cannabis and schizophrenia is interesting. If cannabis can cause schizophrenia in cases where it wouldn't occur naturally, you would expect schizophrenia cases to have risen in line with cannabis use over the last 60 years, yet there has been no such rise. It is possible that it can bring on episodes in those that would have developed schizophrenia anyway, but as you say there is no causal link here either. It's just as likely that the predisposition to schizophrenia also makes them more likely to use cannabis.

Cannabis is certainly not a perfect drug. Even if it isn't physically additive, it can certainly prove addictive for some users, and particularly in heavy users it can definitely affect motivation and increase feelings of anxiousness during use. But the fact is, Cannabis is undoubtedly a far safer drug than Alcohol, and is probably in-line with Caffeine in terms of the overall risks to the individual.

It is a bit conspiracy theory-ish to state, but it is also true that (certainly in the UK, at least) studies that show negative connotations to cannabis use are much more widely reported in the media, and scientists know this.

They may ask the landlord to fix the problem, serve him with a notice to fix the problem else face prosecution the severity of which will match your situation.

Have you informed the letting agent or landlord that there is a problem with the wiring? They are allowed a reasonable time to respond for example if the entire house needs to be rewired then that would take a while to arrange.

If you feel like you've done all of the above and the landlord/agent is still not doing anything then you can take them to court. You would need to work out what your damages were (they don't have to be physical) disrepair claims can be held in small claims court. If you are asking the court to get your landlord to carry out the repairs you can only claim up to £1000 iirc (Google seems to suggest so)

If you want to claim for more than £10,000 you will need a solicitor and you cannot use the small claims court. It can be difficult to get legal aid for a disrepair claim.

Nope, it's a term used to define a geographic area. You can carry on saying that it's just a tool of ""le ebul imperialists xD"" but it's not. Being British doesn't mean you're part of the UK just as being European doesn't mean you're a part of the EU.

&gt;I would reject to them being called the British Isles because they're not all British.

But they are British, because they're part of the British Isles.

&gt;So you should have stopped calling them British around 1922 or 1916 or never have called them it depending on who you ask...

Actually I've been right in calling them British for tens of thousands of years now, if it not longer.

&gt;Or you can call an Irishman British, but it doesn't make it true.

Other than the fact that the Irishman lives in the British Isles?

&gt;But I didn't say that, you made that up in your silly imperialist head.

A market is a pretty basic thing. It is based on supply and demand.  Supply only exists when the seller actively tries to sell commodities. 

A factory makes widgets with the purpose to supply the market with commodities (widgets).  A football club does not produce talent to supply the market. 

A football club produce footballers to enable them to compete in a non-market based competition, i.e. a league and cup competition.

The price, then, is determined by how much of a detriment losing this player is to the selling club. Specifically, how much of a detriment will it be to their ability to compete in the league and cups? They can, just like we did with Bale, make the claim that they need 10m to alleviate the detriment that this loss leads to. And we have to accept that, because there is no store (i.e. market) we can pop over to in order to get a better deal.

Sakho was an established player before even coming to LFC, I'm sure he was signed under the impression that he would be first choice. He left PSG because he was pushed out after their influx of cash, but he was one of their youngest captains and is an established international player.

null,null,TheConnivingPedant,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt;Central banks, like the Bank of England, have an extraordinary privilege and power to magic money out of nowhere.

**All banks** have the power to magic money out of nowhere and do so whenever they extend loans, to finance consumption, new investment or speculation. [From the Old Lady herself (pdf).](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q102.pdf)

&gt;So to avoid a collapse in the currency and rampant inflation, central banks have to be seen to be exercising great restraint in the creation of new money.

Apart from the £375 billion of QE that is... In any case central banks control inflation by setting the base rate of interest, *not* by controling the amount of central bank reserves, or ""new money"".

&gt;The lore of central banks - which, rightly or wrongly, is almost universally accepted by investors - says that central banks should only look at whether there is too much or too little money in the economy in determining whether to increase or shrink the supply of money, and not at narrower economic questions such as whether there are enough roads or houses being being built in Britain.

The Federal Reserve looks output as well as inflation as part of a ""dual mandate"" that many economists have argued should also be adopted by the BoE and ECB.

&gt;[The markets] would fear that if the Bank of England is forced to finance projects that the private sector - by Jeremy Corbyn's admission - won't finance, it would be throwing good money after bad.

There are lots of projects the private sector won't finance, at least not unless the risk is underwritten by government. 

Because of BBC ""impartiality"" Robert Peston is required to provide the hypothetical downside to this idea, but there's really no excuse for getting the basics of money creation and central banking wrong.",null,0,null,1439390744,null,null,false,0,cu0ehsp,null,t3_3gpq0g,null,null,null,t3_3gpq0g,null,null,null,1440434987,null,7,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

What's just so damn annoying is so-called fans doing nothing else but bitching in a super negative tonality when actually, there is nothing to bitch about. I totally understand that some amount of negativity and frustration bears potential for change, which is a great instrument for progress but on the other hand, too much negativity can also lead to a dangerous downward spiral.  
  
Reading this subreddit for the last couple of days felt very depressing. So much bitching around. So much negativity and so much disapointment. Especially when nothing negative has happened at all. Yes. Nothing happened. And what the hell are we all bitching about? We bitch about the fact that nothing happened. Get the fuck out - that's ridiculous, don't you think? Seriously, when we only bitch about that nothing is happenening, that's the prime example for a First World Problem.  
  
Why? Because our squad is still very good. The other teams better strengthen their squads with good money because our squad will only improve. We have a couple of very talented players who will only become better with time to ripe and time playing together with team-mates who don't fucking change every transfer window. Yes, we need some patching up here and there but the transfer window is still open 3 weeks and we never had a clue who Martinez is after anyway.  
  
There is no reason to be as negative as we are. I think most of the people who are so negative are just simply jealous and highly bored. They see Stoke et al. and wish we would have signed every single player they signed, engaged in high end bidding wars etc. When the hell did we even care what the others did? It was always about us, our strengths and we even sing ""we don't care what the red shite say"" before every single game. But we care what all the others do. Congratulations to all those negative haters - you make your sentiment dependent on outer factors which is a very mature and constructive way to deal with things.  
  
I think noone has a problem with people being constructive about what they think could be improved but the always-present negative sentiment and envy of other clubs' doings is just setting the tonality around here lately.  
  
Yes, I am not a Liverpudlian. I have never been to Goodison Park. I have only once seen the team play live but I've watched nearly every game at home since I became a blue a couple of years ago. And I don't like how this reddit turns into a hivemind of negativity that's setting the tone to nearly everything that's being posted here. I was on the verge of quitting this reddit as I have quit GOT because it's just such a bitter place. I cannot imagine that I am the only one being fed up with the chronic naysayers and haters.  
  
So. Yes, I also question whether the haters are real fans at all. Constant bitching and making all the others feel bad is actively destroying our community of fans in times when we should support each other, the club, our manager and our board even more. Wasn't being Evertonian about being part of something bigger? About being chosen? If the group of ""chosen"" people is actually just an accumulation of negative and jealous whiners, who the hell wants to be associated with them?!

null,null,LtSlow,null,null,null,"I think it's right in the point culture and race is replacing the different groups that class used to have years ago. 

Right now (despite what many lefties would argue) the rich and poor are the closest they've ever been in history. 

Yes, the 1% may earn 20x what you do, but you all surf the same Internet, shitpost on the same forums, mostly use the same electronics, mostly wear the same clothes (do comfortable clothes from matalan REALLY set you behind someone in designer clothes?) and watch the same TV, even if the rich man's TV might be a few inches wider. 

Unless you're literally poverty stricken (which is a very small percent of Britain) you don't live badly at all, the problem here is people like to split into small groups, it's biological, we want our tribe, it helps us feel secure. Years ago that may have been a working class street community spirit, toughing it out and pooling resources to get along, now everybody basically has what they need, even the poorest seem to have the Internet, which basically supplies you with infinite entertainment. 

So of course people find new groups for them to make up. We're all from Bangladesh? Awesome, that's our group, you're all from this religion? That's another group, etc etc, it helps people feel secure and less alone 

There's not a way to fix it, people like their own groups and don't like to cross mix, there was a study somewhere which said people like to know about 50 or 100 people and don't care about knowing any more. 

Now that worked years ago in your small Street, or village, but what do you do now there's a thousand living in your block? You shut down, you lose community spirit, you can't possible know everyone so you don't even try

null,null,samaiwa,wales-Glamorgan,Glamorgan,null,"&gt;it's a term used by britain to define a geographic area which includes non-British countries as being British. A term which is not used by Ireland and disliked by most Irish people. It is an erroneous term.

Really? Because nowhere outside of the British Isles has ever been referred to as being geographically British. Take the Falklands for example, it's culturally and politically British but it is not a part of the British Isles because it's in South America. Again, you are confusing political states with geographic locations and it's pretty painful to watch you go round in circles on this matter.

&gt;But they are not British, because they don't consider themselves British and don't use the term British Isles because it's an inaccurate and disrespectful term.

It is an accurate term because they are British. They can reject UK citizenship if they have it, but they cannot deny that they are British no matter how hard they try.

&gt;""From the Irish perspective, the term ""British"" had never applied to Ireland until at least the late 16th century and onwards.""

&gt;Something like 80% of the world's countries disagree with Israel's opposition to a two-state solution.

Israel is the one that supports the 2 state solution. Netanyahu said in May - ""We want a peace that would end the conflict once and for all ... I don't support a one-state solution, I don't believe that's a solution at all, I support the vision of two states for two peoples."" The vast majority of Israelis oppose the one state solution.

Over 80% of Palestinians reject the existence of Israel completely regardless of its borders and believe it is essential that all of historic Palestine be theirs (except the bits in Lebanon, Syria &amp; Jordan of course). Israel is the only one that has made concrete offers of a 2 state solution, which the Palestinians rejected with no counter offer. You have the conflict completely backwards. In polls ~40% of Palestinians ""support"" a 2 state solution, but only if they are allowed the right of return to Israel, which is effectively a one state solution.

José Enrique (Valencia, 1986) these days trains outside the group with Balottelli and Borini. However, he hasn't given up [on rejoining the first team]. [Jose] is willing to use the final year of his current contract at Anfield to try to change Rodgers's mind.

Question (Q): How things are going to Liverpool?

Answer (A): I am in a difficult position. [LiverpoolFC] have alienated Balotelli, Borini and I. I have a year remaining on my contract and I imagine that the club will want to sell me, but I still want to stay and fight as I always have. If a multi-year offer came in [from another club] and I would have more options to play, I would consider it.

Q: [Are you] confident you will return for Brendan?

A: I will not give up. Football changes from day to night. I know from experience. My knee is perfect, after [the previous] two years with discomfort and Liverpool is obliged to register me. In addition, [Moreno] is the only pure leftback in the setup and I know that if I stay I'll play. I want to prove them [ed: Brendan and the club] wrong.

Q. What Liverpool will we see this season, the Liverpool that finished second in the 2013-14 or sixth in 2014-15?

A. This season we have no excuse to not get in the top four. [The club] has spent a lot of money to bring in good players and I think [the manager] has built a great squad. We have many alternatives [ed: for positions].

Q: Aren't those big words, fighting to win the league following 26 years of drought?

A: In football you never know. We must try to fight for everything, [mustn't] refuse anything. No one expected us to finish second. It is true that [then] we had a player like Suarez, so it's more complicated [now that he is gone]. I am sure that last season, had we had Luis, we would have finished second or third. I will not say we will win the league [only] because Chelsea had a great season.

Q: Who do you see as the favorite in the fight for the Premier League title?

A: Chelsea. Mourinho is the best coach in the world. You can play right or wrong, but you [have the desire]. In that sense one can make the comparison to Simeone, who won the League over Madrid and Barcelona despite having a lesser budget.

Q: It hurt a lot to lose the League after Gerrard's slip against Chelsea?

A: Yes, what bad luck! I was injured for much of the season, but would have loved to have a Premier League title among [my] honors. We had a fantastic season. I think we were the most deserving. It is unfortunate that happened to us.

Q: Speak about that name. Is the absence of Gerrard notable in the locker room?

A. Yes, you are missing, above all, what he symbolized. I wish he had stayed. Three summers ago we went to Malaysia and Stevie was king ... and then it was Suarez. To [replace those elements] you'd have to sign a guy like Messi. [Stevie] was the emblem of the team. To his credit, after all his years at Liverpool and everything he won ... he was the most normal guy imaginable.

Q: Is Henderson a worthy heir [to Gerrard]?

A: Stevie is irreplaceable. Jordan knows it too. They have given [Henderson] the captaincy because he deserves it, but he must find his own way [of captaining Liverpool]. I'm glad to give him the armband because he is an example in terms of work[ethic]: he's the first in and last out, always.

Q: Do [the club] miss Suarez less [than Gerrard]?

A: If Gerrard was God in Liverpool, Luis was almost God. Suarez is irreplaceable. I shared a dressing room with Riquelme, Forlán—but none as good as him. He is among the five best [footballers] in the world. I would love to have 11 of Suarez. Barcelona has hit 100% [ed: of their potential quality?] with his signing.

Q: Is [Raheem] Sterling worth the 69 million that City has paid?

A: I understand [the deal for] Liverpool. I think for that money you have to sell, but it is a great signing for City. There's nothing to what people say about him—he is super quiet, careful, does not like to go —he doesn't seem [just] 20 years old. He spent three years in the Premiership and has almost played more games than me [laughs (original edit)]. Now we have to see how he handles all the pressure around him there. Bale, who is older, for example, didn't show his highest level at [Real] Madrid last time in his sophomore season.

Q: Can Balotelli perform at the highest level?

A: Here [it will be] difficult [for Mario] because the club has already moved [on and] do not want him. He has beastly attributes: fast, strong, technical—. Then, with further work, but you already know this—then find a team in which to play to prove everyone wrong. [ed: I took Jose to be suggesting Mario has to move on to get his chance to prove people wrong, but he could be thinking there is a way to do that at the club or even on loan. It is unclear to be whether or not Enrique is really saying Mario just has to move on or not.]

Q: On to a newcomer. What can Benteke bring to Liverpool?

A: I've always like him. Reaching the 31 goals Luis scored without penalties would be very tricky, but [Benteke] was best striker we could sign in the Premier League. He's [*strong like bull*], hits it well with both feet, which gets overlooked—. He can compliment Sturridge well—they can form one of the best striker combinations in the league. Benteke can hold the ball and Sturridge is very fast. Then there are Ings and Origi, who have big futures.

Q: Can be Ibe's successor Sterling?

A: If Liverpool handles him well, another 69 million euro-player. He is super quiet, like Raheem, but he's got more qualities. He has been our best player in preseason. He is strong, and that's without even touching a weight, can drive [with the ball] and hit the ball with both feet. He is top, top, top.

Q: How do you handle competing with your friend Alberto Moreno for a job?

A: Everyone wants to play, but we're people before players. I have spent many years away from home and know [the difficulties of moving], more so for [someone from] Seville [laughs (original editor)]. Alberto is a great player, completely different from me, and has a great future: he's a player for Spain.

Jose Enrique and his relationship with Alberto Moreno

Q: Jose Enrique, is it back to Spain if you do leave the 'Pool'?

A: What I think is that I will not play in a team better than this. [Liverpool] [a]re bested only by a Madrid or a Barcelona. Liverpool [is the equal of Manchester] United. It is true that we've gone many years without winning the league, but we must not forget that has five Champions Leagues. I had a very good option to return to Spain, but [the situation] is complicated because the economy is very different from what we have [in the UK]. Only two teams [in Spain] can match [the wages] in England, so I'd like to stay here as long as my legs will let me.",null,0,null,1439392290,null,null,false,0,cu0fgyv,null,t3_3gpts7,null,null,null,t3_3gpts7,null,null,null,1440435448,null,32,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,32,null

Balotelli was a complete waste of money.  Even if we manage to shift him, we're going to have to write off something approaching £6-8M this year, likely as a special item.  That sort of thing is really bad for the club's bottom line and I really have no idea why the club proceeded to do that deal.  I would have held onto the money until January when hopefully more targets might have been available and hoped Lambert/Borini could do their best until then.

The bigger issue for me is BR has brought in 31 players in (now) going on 4 years, which is a ridiculous amount and near half of them have already been shifted on or likely will be after having zero or near so impact.  We really should be down to buying a couple a year at best by now.

To answer your questions, I've had a season ticket for 5 years now so whilst I feel I can comfortably answer your questions I would point out I've spent the last 5 years sitting in the same area of the stadium so there may be different parts with different atmospheres. However to answer your questions:

1) Matches are completely safe, I've seen opposition fans within the home crowd cheering a goal and there has been no 'trouble' so you'll be fine! Obviously they got dirty looks but the days of hooliganism really are gone in the premier league when it comes to fights, so you're perfectly safe. But advice on how not to irritate fans is: don't openly support the team we're playing against.

2) Food wise, i'll be honest there aren't many great restaurants, for that the best bet is eat at Stratford (Westfield) before the match and then get the tube (15 minutes) to Upton Park station, but if you want a typical experience eat at one of the burger vans along the way.

3) Dress - casual, some wear west ham tops but at least 50% of people are in jeans and t shirts

4) Just like any large groups of people you can't guarantee there will be zero racists, but I'm almost certain she won't experience anything.

null,null,pacifismisevil,null,null,null,"&gt;Israel is blockading Gaza, they control everything that goes in and out.

Not true. Gaza has a border with Egypt. Israel does not control it in any way shape or form. Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005, and [the blockade was declared legal by the UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid#UN_Palmer_Report) because of Hamas' constant importing of weapons it used against Israel. Restrictions on things like concrete are clearly justified due to Hamas' misuse of it to build infiltration tunnels:

[The Israeli military has provided estimates that Hamas spent around $30 to $90 million, and poured 600,000 tons of concrete, in order to build three dozen tunnels.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_tunnel_warfare_in_the_Gaza_Strip)

What other country supplies 90% of their enemy's goods to them during war time?

&gt;essentially prisoner in a couple of hundreds km/sq which contains nearly 2 million people making it the second most densely population 'nation' on earth, and one of the poorest

It's not Israel's fault that Gazans overpopulated the land they have. 50% of Gazans are under 18 years old. There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. They are by far the highest recipients of [international aid per capita](http://i.imgur.com/DABVgql.jpg) and have the [216th lowest mortality rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_mortality_rate#Countries) in the world. Israel is 0.2% of the land in the middle east and already overpopulated, why should it be the one to make room for people of Gaza? Jordan, Egypt and other countries have plenty of land, and they're the ones that actually keep their Palestinian refugees in camps, forbidding them jobs or passports. Israel does not forbid Palestinians living within Israel's borders from holding jobs or passports.

&gt;expect to be thanked when you allow them a meagre food supply so they can 'barely survive'.

Israel gives them more food than anyone else gives them. Why not criticise Sweden for not giving Gazans more food? I don't expect to be thanked, I expect third parties to see that Israel is not starving the Palestinians and in fact is providing them food, electricity, etc with no moral obligation to do so.

Lyon are getting the better deal, but we just need to fill the spot. If this gives any (or all) of our forwards a kick up the back side, then £10/11m is absolutely nothing in hindsight. 

From what has been said, N'Jie can play as a wide man and a centre forward. That gives competition to: Chadli, Lamela, Townsend, Kane, Adebayor, Soldado, Pritchard, Dembele (potentially if he is utilised on the right), Eriksen (if he is utilised on the left). 

Seeing as how N'Jie is pacey, young and going to likely work his ass off to get fit to Poch's levels, then you would likely see a ripple effect through the attacking forces of the squad who want to keep their position. 

**TL;DR:** Even if he isn't played much, he's a threat to the rest of the starting lineup and will motivate them to work harder in order to not drop down the pecking order.

null,null,DBD420,ter-falklandIsles,Falkland Islands,null,"Well fathom this. You are making the claim that alcohol and tobacco is more harmful than cannabis, which is an unfair comparison for many reasons.

Firstly, ""harm"" is immediately normative and inexplicit. Most of the papers you are referring to describe personal harm, that is harm to the user internally.

From here it becomes difficult to understand the true effects as it is incredibly difficult to isolate third party effects on the individuals being tested over long periods of time. We get into murky territory when we try to look at long term health effects of the two drugs in question, as there is so much that goes on in the test participants' lives (diet, exercise, working conditions, living conditions, their mental health/physical health prior to being tested). My dispute is the use of the word ""harm"" and your choice of the word ""unbiased evidence"", which I am sorry, is simply not true.

Socioeconomic studies, and this is a socioeconomic study when we discuss ""harm"", are **incredibly** difficult to understand the true effects, *ceteris paribus*, of the drug in question as we cannot hold all other factors in isolation and control them (poverty, income inequality, diet, exercise, social mobility, crime) whilst testing the drug's true effect on society.

Which leads me to my next point. Third-party effects, or negative externalities. I am not disputing that alcohol, cigarettes and cannabis have them, and in varying proportions, but what I would say is that cannabis has been illegal for quite some time so it's true effects are not known and cannot be fairly compared to something that is legal (alcohol) as cannabis' effects on society are muted from it being illegal. Also, cannabis is often taken with alcohol which again leads to measuring problems.

There are also a couple of other points I wanted to raise briefly.

* What are the effects on family?
* What are the effects on social life?
* What are the effects on those on lower incomes/the Jeremy Kyle class versus the bourgeoisie, bohemians and middle classes who take cannabis purely for recreational use?

You can dismiss my post if you wish, call me a troll or take it head on but in either case defining the word ""harm"" and being able to measure true ""harm"" as accurately as possible is what makes the debate far from closed. The onus is on people like you who want something legalised to make the case for it, but I am sorry there is just too much that people, particularly scientists, on your side of the debate refuse to acknowledge. Harm comes in all shapes and sizes, some that your side even choose to dismiss, and to say that the more harmful thing (alcohol) is legal whereas the less harmful thing (cannabis) is illegal, and so it should be made legal as it is less harmful, when your side can't even get an accurate picture of the harm to begin with is overly simplistic and unconvincing.",null,0,null,1439393996,null,null,false,0,cu0gleb,null,t3_3glqo8,null,null,null,t1_cu0fadp,null,null,null,1440435977,null,0,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

Nothing suggests that the Moment causes Bad Wolf. The Bad Wolf arc was neatly wrapped up in the first Season of the revived series, where it was revealed that Rose Tyler, in Bad Wolf form, had placed the various mentions of ""Bad Wolf"" throughout time and space for the Doctor to see.

On the final day of the Time War, the Moment's interface, which transcended time and space through its sheer complexity, chose to look like Rose Tyler because, having seen Rose in the Doctor's timeline, it thought he would appreciate it; the interface simply made the mistake of looking like someone the Doctor hadn't met yet.

The Moment's interface looking like Rose Tyler does not, in any way, prove that the Moment, a Galiffreyan super-weapon, and the Bad Wolf, an entity created by Rose Tyler consuming the power of the entire Time Vortex, are the same thing. The Moment doesn't create the Bad Wolf, the Bad Wolf creates the Bad Wolf (that was kind of the point of that story arc, by the way), and the Moment chooses, earlier in the Doctor's timeline, to look like the Bad Wolf.

As for Rodgers preferring certain players: Henderson was a committee buy. Even Balotelli was a committee buy, and we all saw how he gave Balo multiple opportunities to show his qualities -- he just never has, consistently. Meanwhile, Henderson stayed, fought for his place, proved that he could play in the ways Rodgers wants, and now he's the captain! I don't subscribe to the idea that Rodgers prefers ""his"" buys over those of the ""committee."" The facts just don't back it up, IMO.

I agree that Sakho probably signed with the idea he'd get more game time at LFC. Whether he's a French international is irrelevant; he just hasn't yet proven himself at the club level in England. He's been injured, repeatedly, which put a dampener on his progress at the club. And we don't see the training sessions like Rodgers does. Lovren did very well this past weekend. Skrtel is one of the first names on the team sheet. And Sakho doesn't have the mobility Rodgers wants in the full-back positions. So it's up to Sakho to compete to replace Skrtel or Lovren on the team sheet. If Rodgers doesn't see him doing it, he benches him. But I suspect we'll see Sakho _plenty_ this season, given the number of games we have lined up.

For years, LFC has failed to have depth in the squad. And now we do. Which means good players are going to be sat on the bench or out of the match day squad from time to time. Rodgers has to manage their expectations and keep them all hungry. Based on what I've seen from him, he does a pretty good job of that. So we might want certain players to play but we will frequently disappointed -- and rightly so because only 11 can play at a time and we have a squad of increasing depth and quality.

Hi there,

I am deciding to sell this card as I want to get the Hall of Fame edition to match my new build. It was an RMA replacement from OcUK granted on the 28th of July, so it's about two weeks old, and it hasn't failed me since. It clocks to 1570/2000 without fail in synthetic benchmarks, as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/hvSPFXI.png).

I am looking for £500 for the card and £10 for P&amp;P, and a timestamp can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/a2a5eA6.jpg). It will be posted via UPS a day or two after purchase, depending on time/day of purchase.

Just a word of warning: Some Corsair PSUs (mainly CX, CXM, CS, and even RM/i) are known to cause coil whine with 8+8 pin cards, such as the one I am selling. The whine is *not* from the card, but the power supply itself.

Thanks,

I'm not really sure if its fair to call this a conflict of interest but I linked to it because it is a good summary of a few big studies. We haven't seen many studies yet, because its difficult to study the effects of an illegal substance on human subjects.

I certainly wouldn't call any of the authors of the studies biased, they're mostly academics, and it is multiple studies.

&gt;Correlation does not infer causation

I already mentioned this when I said:

&gt;There is certainly an argument of cause and effect being the wrong way round in many instances

The study you are talking about was actually a 40 person study, which is small, but it isn't a 20 person study. Its also the first human study after years of research on other animals, as is typical with studies of this nature.

It doesn't change the brain in a unique way, but it does change the brain in a way that suggest that it is more addictive than we previously thought. There are obviously other things which are addictive, but a better example of an activity that ""is associated with exposure-dependent alterations of the neural matrix of core reward structures"" would be gambling (although caffeine is a good one also, as is junk food like chocolate), as they are both addictive, but not necessarily chemically addictive.

&gt; If cannabis can cause schizophrenia in cases where it wouldn't occur naturally

Nobody claims this. The claim is that cannabis accelerates some specific mental illnesses in those already prone to those mental illnesses. In that way it is similar to alcohol in that some people are prone to becoming alcoholics, or violent whereas many can drink without issue.

&gt;you would expect schizophrenia cases to have risen in line with cannabis use over the last 60 years

Actually [recreational drug use is in decline](http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blog/its-true-drug-use-declining-uk-%E2%80%93-isn%E2%80%99t-argument-against-decriminalisation) in the UK. I would expect the usage to have gone up and down over time as other drugs became more popular. Either way, I think we would all expect schizophrenia sufferer numbers to go down over time as treatment becomes more effective and less people get misdiagnosed (and get diagnosed with  more specific mental illnesses) as our knowledge of the disorder increases. Do you have any evidence that schizophrenia cases aren't going up anyway or are you just assuming that they are not? Do you have any evidence that cannabis use has increased over the past 60 years for that matter?

I agree that criminalisation isn't working, but you can't ask for scientific studies and then dismiss any conflicting science as wrong. It is impossible to have a balanced and reasonable debate about what we should do about drugs when those asking for its legalisation the loudest refuse to acknowledge that there is research that shows that cannabis is more dangerous than they claim.

I actually think that this mindset is what turns people away from supporting legalisation.

I passed on my second try from the Altnagelvin Test centre a couple of years back. My instructor advised me to book a test around 10-11am during a weekday. The roads are a bit quieter around that time as it's past rush hour and before lunchtime. Most people attribute failing to one of the test instructors, Paddy No Heart, who I had the delight of getting on both tests.

Anyway, getting weekly lessons was a commitment in itself for me, and I couldn't even imagine having to take a train to Coleraine and back every time you wanted to take a lesson (granted, I was extremely busy with final year uni). If you have the time though, it's worth consideration.

Personally, I would just stick to Derry. Yes, the roads are more difficult, and instructors may be tighter, but you'll only be a better driver. It may take a few tries to pass, but you'll get there. It can be disheartening when you fail, you just have to rebook it and learn from your mistakes.

Best of luck!

I am guessing your kid was below the age of 5? Possibly 2 to 4 (That's the age they tend to play outside where they can get bitten) causee of the IV Abx. 

Okay. 

The vast majority of insect bites do not get infected. I work in India and have had thousands of mosquito bites. One got infected so far. If I came in for each of those thousands (I mean I get bitten once a day at least) then I would be on Abx permanently. 

You had to wait till the bite got infected (which is what orbital cellulitis is) before the Abx would work. 

Oh and the A&amp;E is the wrong place for that since it's not a common diagnosis. It's an emergency but a rare one in the UK and more the purview of the ophthalmologist than the A&amp;E.

[which is **not** open](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-british-government-wants-egypt-to-open-its-border-crossing-into-gaza-10293667.html). It was open after the Arab Spring but the re-emergence of the old military junta has closed that border.

&gt;Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005

Yes. I never said they were occupying Gaza rather they are blockading it. Which is what they are doing. People within Gaza don't have the right to leave freely not to those outside have the right to enter freely. Similarly Israel patrols the coast meaning the fishing - one of the few sources of revenue left for Gazan's - is limited to zones 20km of shore and no further.

The Israeli military is not a reliable source of information

&gt;There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza

Ignorant and immoral. Oxfam call is [Crisis in Gaza](https://www.oxfam.org/en/emergencies/crisis-gaza):

**""More than 100,000 people (more than half of these children) have had their homes destroyed and are still displaced. Most of the water supply is unsafe to drink and there are power cuts of 12 hours a day.** Restrictions on essential building materials mean that rebuilding homes has yet to begin. The blockade prevents most people from leaving Gaza or trading with the outside world and markets in the West Bank. Fishermen and farmers are restricted from accessing their land and often shot at while working. **The economy has been devastated, with more than 60 per cent of youth now unemployed - the highest rate in the world.""**

* The blockade - now in place for eight years - has devastated Gaza's economy, left most people unable to leave Gaza, restricted people from essential services such as healthcare and education, and cut Palestinians in Gaza off from those in the West Bank.

* More than 40% of people in Gaza - 67% of youth - are now unemployed and 80% of people are in need of aid.

* Many key industries, such as the construction industry, have been decimated as essential materials are not allowed into Gaza. Of the 19,000 homes left in need of reconstruction by last year’s hostilities, not one has been rebuilt.

* Exports recently fell to less than 3% of their pre-blockade levels, with heavy restrictions on the transfer of agricultural produce and other goods to Palestinian markets in the West Bank.

&gt;Israel is 0.2% of the land in the middle east and already overpopulated, why should it be the one to make room for people of Gaza? 

Because Israel occupies the land of Palestinians. Gazan's are Palestinians. What you say is equal to Israel capturing and occupying Kent, removing those who live there and then saying 'well there's lots of space in Russia, go there'. Similarly Gaza has been consistently reduced in size which each military attack by Israel upon it. Only last year the Israeli invasion pushed the *de facto* border back by 20km and destroyed all houses within that area (to create a so called safe zone).

&gt;Israel does not forbid Palestinians living within Israel's borders from holding jobs or passports.

Yes it does. You're just taking the word of the Israeli government at face-value. Palestinians living in the occupied terrorises for example aren't Israeli citizens however they live under Israeli occupation (in violations of international law), this means Israeli can chose what rights they have. These Palestinians aren't subject to the civil courts of a 'normal' citizen, but are subject to military courts (without a jury), again in violation of international law. Similarly these Palestinians don't have rights to free movement within Palestinian territory, the occupied Palestinian territories or Israel because they are not Israeli citizens. 

There are Palestinians and Arabs who are Israeli citizens and they indeed do possess in law the same rights as an Israeli, but they are a small minority who live in Israel. The vast majority of Palestinians live in the occupied territories, Gaza, or displaced further afield in Jordan, Lebanon etc.

&gt;Israel gives them more food than anyone else gives them

GAZA is under siege. If Israel lets it have free trade with the rest of the world then it wouldn't need those supplies. Similarly Israel has regularly stopped and limited aid convoys reaching Gaza. The Israeli state is in a constant state of war with Gaza. Israeli is occupying the territory of Palestinians, no other country is, only the utter-apologist wants people to thanks Israeli for giving them food. Next we'll have to thanks them for not dropping their nuclear bombs in Gaza I guess, or praise them for just torturing the thousands they have imprisoned without charge rather than simply murdering them.

The Israeli's have taken most of the water supply out of the hands of Palestinians and most of the best arable land. You then want Palestinians to praise Israel when the give a fraction of those resources back to Palestinians. Israel is worse than apartheid ever was (and I've heard and met many anti-apartheid activists who say it). You've just let the strong Israeli disinformation and propaganda machine do your thinking for you (supported by the complicit and apathetic west). I've been to the racist state called Israel, I've seen the separate pedestrian zones, the separate ambulances and licence plates reserved for Palestinians.

null,null,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"&gt;The article is written by Richard Taite as you said, who runs an addiction clinic and has written about addiction. I'm not really sure if its fair to call this a conflict of interest but I linked to it because it is a good summary of a few big studies. We haven't seen many studies yet, because its difficult to study the effects of an illegal substance on human subjects.
I certainly wouldn't call any of the authors of the studies biased, they're mostly academics, and it is multiple studies.

I didn't call the study authors biased, though Richard Taite clearly has a financial interest in cannabis being seen as a highly addictive drug because he is paid by individuals to treat addiction.

&gt;Nobody claims this. 

*Lots* of people both claim and believe that cannabis directly causes psychosis/schizophrenia. You didn't though, which I already stated before. :)

&gt;Actually recreational drug use is in decline in the UK. I would expect the usage to have gone up and down over time as other drugs became more popular. Either way, I think we would all expect schizophrenia sufferer numbers to go down over time as treatment becomes more effective and less people get misdiagnosed (and get diagnosed with more specific mental illnesses) as our knowledge of the disorder increases. Do you have any evidence that schizophrenia cases aren't going up anyway or are you just assuming that they are not? Do you have any evidence that cannabis use has increased over the past 60 years for that matter?

It's in decline over the last 20 years or so, but from a very high base compared to 1955!

Proof that incidence of mental illness has not increased over time:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310436/
Proof that cannabis use has risen hugely over the last 60 years:
http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1520

&gt;I agree that criminalisation isn't working, but you can't ask for scientific studies and then dismiss any conflicting science as wrong. It is impossible to have a balanced and reasonable debate about what we should do about drugs when those asking for its legalisation the loudest refuse to acknowledge that there is research that shows that cannabis is more dangerous than they claim.
I actually think that this mindset is what turns people away from supporting legalisation. As soon as someone realises that what they were told was a half truth regarding the safety of it, they assume that everything campaigners say is a lie.

Again, you're making statements of fact that you have no right to make about the safety of cannabis. There is a huge amount of evidence that cannabis is safer than any other recreational drug, collated over many many years. The vast majority of independent scientific advisory boards on drugs worldwide state the same.

The only people telling ""half-truths"" are the media and government for jumping on any study they can find that shows cannabis in a bad light, and trying to paint a picture of cannabis as a dangerous drug.

Ok, perhaps nobody was a tad hyperbolic. I mean no scientists claim that, but in fact you did claim that when you said

&gt;If cannabis can cause schizophrenia in cases where it wouldn't occur naturally

Which isn't an accurate representation of the argument being made in any of the studies I have read, or the argument I was originally making.

Your study on schizophrenia does suggest that ""We found no evidence to support an overall change in the incidence of psychotic disorder over time"", but it doesn't study the severity of those disorders, which I guess is what would be expected from cannabis affecting people already prone to schizophrenia. I'm not going to keep moving the goalposts though, you did find what I was looking for so thanks for that.

I'm not making any statements of fact, I am pointing you towards the studies that you asked to see as you originally seemed to suggest that no such studies existed. You can disagree with these studies if you like, but there are many more, the evidence is not as one sided as you were suggesting.

&gt;Very successfully I might add

This is why you do not have to leave when the notice expires, because the tenancy has not ended. Your do not become a trespasser or anything like that. The golden rule is a landlord cannot end a tenancy, only a tenant or a court can. 

After the notice expires the landlord can then apply to Court for an order to evict you. This normally takes 6-10 weeks. The Court will then order you to leave by a certain date (normally giving you two weeks notice). So if the landlord hasn't stsrt proceedings yet (you would know because you would be notified) there is little chance of him getting you out by 30 September. 

I would not be aggressive and starting sending links to statute. I would say you intend to remain in occupation as is you right until the earlier of (a) 30 September, (b) a Court orders you to. 

The risks are:

(i) the landord starts proceedings and you end up having to pay some court fees (maybe a few £100).
(ii) the landlord tries to illegally evict you
(iii) he tried to keep back some deposit through spite. 

Risk one can be mitigated by pointing out you would leave anyway before the Court process would be completed. Risk two, it may be worth changing the locks - a good locksmith can change the barrel of a lock easily and cheaply (just remember to change them back). Risk three is covered by the fact that your deposit should be protected. 

TL:DR - CAB is correct. No need to leave until Court orders (which doesn't impact credit history or anything) and that would likely take you beyond 30 September.

null,null,urbannnomad,null,null,null,"Yea no problem, I'm just here to discuss, we all want the same thing in the end.

I agree with some stuff, the only thing is that Henderson was bought before Rodgers joined the club so it is a bit different. My opinion on this is that Rodgers should be able to adjust his tactics to get the best out of the players we have, we don't have the luxury to exclude decent players unless they are actually being disruptive (in which case they should get fined). I think too much blame went to the players last year instead of the manager, I just don't like this excuse.


I agree that we need depth and that players need to understand their role, the only issue is how that is communicated and how that is done. If a player is dropped for another player that is struggling, I would understand the conflict that arises from that. If a senior player like Agger is not picked after playing well, he deserves an explanation about his new role (starter -&gt; sub) instead of being mysteriously dropped without any explanation. You can talk about injuries, but this happened while he was fit and the team was playing well. 
This is Agger's interview after he left:

 “When you are a part of the starting eleven for several games in a row and the team have performed well, and you feel that you have played well, then you are left out of the team and don’t feel appreciated, it starts to get pray on your mind and you wonder.

“Then at the same time you see the statistics from your game – which are so important all around the world of football – and you don’t understand why you weren’t used more often.” 

I just don't want any players in the team just because Rodgers needs to justify the price tag or that he brought them in. 

Honestly, only time will tell if benching Sakho is the right decision. He had a conflict with Rodgers last year as well so that is why I'm bringing it up, so it SEEMS like there's more to it. It is the general opinion that Sakho is a better player than Lovren, so if Lovren does well then Rodgers' decision will be justified.

null,null,kubalaczak,null,null,null,"First about Giroud - it probably would work in a match where he gets some good passes, but he didn't because midfield played bad. And I'm saying that because it works frequently, not only against you but versus most teams, the difference is that he is much better against you than Walcott - and that's the point, someone was saying that starting Giroud over Walcott was a decision made because of being cocky, while this is just a common sense.
Second of all - Sanchez. Yes, it is not the best choice to have not fully prepared player on the bench, but we loaned out Gnabry to WBA, Wilshere got injured in last days (he performs very good on the right wing, so there could be some rotation). And it's better to have Sanchez, who is a top class player on the bench, so he have the possibility to change the game with one touch. Unfortunately he didn't, it didn't work out this time. Third - how am I delusional about Cech? It was a horrible, obvious mistake with the first goal and he, as one of the greatest goalkeepers of the last decade should've saved the second goal with ease. I admited defenders should've done better, put more pressure on players with the ball, but they didn't - it's a mistake. But it doesn't change that shot shouldn't go in any day of the week, it wasn't exceptionally powerful or accurate. Fourth - you are just saying the same stuff I did so I don't know what are you not agreeing with. I said Oxlade was the only one who played well, some played bad - like Cech and Ramsey and the rest wasn't either awful or good. And the thing about the cost of Ozil - I there will be matches when Payet will play worse than players we paid nothing for, so it's just a stupid example that can be used for any player, because you can always point out bad performances for anyone, especially when the whole team played rather bad. 5th - I know defenders were positioned badly during the first goal and didn't put enough pressure during second - as I said earlier. And I think I said there were not enough runs from midfielders to put away a little but of defenders attenton from Giroud - if I didn't I still realize that. And from me - Wenger is the last one to blame after this game.

The idea of wedge politics is to use a hot button issue as a 'wedge' to divide the opposition. This is working better than they ever expected with the rise of Corbyn. 

They're not even trying to hide it either. Cameron openly asked that the Greens be represented in the debates. This was a very deliberate attempt split the 'left'. 

Crosby who ran their campaign used this in Australian election for years. Generally with regards to immigration. Which is a hot button issue in Australia and an issue that divides the Labour Party over there 

Labour need to come up with a way to counter this soon or they'll just keep losing elections.

I always gave BR the benefit since he is young he can change but it hasnt happened, and it will not happen. 
The previous years before champions we had europa and we failed europa. No1 cared because, well because it was europa so everyone brush it off. But he has never done well in these matchups i was afraid about our champions league year. 

When ppl were celebrating to have the easiest group i posted something along the lines of ""BR hasnt done anything in europe, lets not celebrate yet. We have to take these teams seriously because we could get knocked out"" -- got downvoted, BR reviewed as best manager, and people were just happy.

Honestly suarez wonder year was great for the confidence of the fans, and i honestly think we dont need billions of dollar players to win the league. But we def need to be malleable and thats something hard, and i dont think BR has got that. BR can be a good manager but he will never take us to the top.

The reality is you have a mayor who wants to push through lots of vanity projects for his 'legacy' and wants them all in place before May 2016.

Instead of getting the people who will actually have to deliver the service, onside, he tells TfL management (who are most obliging, but I'll come to them in a minute) to push it through.

What is taking the piss is people like yourself, getting your knickers in a twist and spouting your two minutes of hate towards the wrong people.

Instead you should be questioning why it is that these 'negotiations' always come to a head, why it is that TfL always capitulate from their original position, and most of all why a public body is so secretive about how it's run, and their refusal to divest information to the public, which as it's a state run company, we own it.

But it's easier to hate on some other workers who have collectively secured themselves a decent payscale, than question the shadowy beast that employs them.

null,null,JustAhobbyish,,Labour Member,null,"&gt; Here's what I don't get. Why is lending for infrastructure considered ""throwing good money after bad"" but not speculating on BtL?

Fiscal policy is a political choice and monetary policy is non political choice.  Fear is turning it into a political choice would weaken the BoE. Of course BoE current tools only have so much power which is why other methods of directing monetary policy is being debated within the BoE. 

Speculating on house prices is another big problem with the UK which would require some Government policy changes, BoE can only do so much. 

&gt; Investing in infrastructure will raise future tax revenue and grow the economy. You can't just write it off as ""spending on popular projects"". How insulting to not only the electorate but the thousands of very smart people who study areas like housing and think we need investment.

True but you open up the door for the BoE to be used to fund projects just to win seats within the house of commons.  That said UK badly needs to increase investment in infrastructure and business investment and training / education.  Do think this needs a mix of fiscal policy and monetary.

- In left/right terms, Norman was closer to my views, but let's not allow our familiarity to lead us to overplay their differences. Norman's and Tim's views are practically indistinguishable relative to the gaping chasm that exists between, for example, Jeremy Corbyn and Liz Kendall.

- I was therefore happy voting for Tim on the basis that the main quality I was looking for in the new leader was the ability to get the liberal message out and to be heard. I think even many of Norman's supporters would agree that Tim is the more effective communicator. The fact he didn't serve in the coalition government and voted against the new tuition fees package also means (unfairly) that ex-Lib Dem voters who abandoned us because of the coalition are more likely to give him a fairer hearing.

- That last point becomes especially important if a left-winger like Jeremy Corbyn becomes Labour leader. You'd imagine that a Blairite would be more likely to accept the status quo on issues like tuition fees and quietly move on from this.

What makes you think this? I feel as if the club have been very open to moving Borini on for a fair value, same as Balotelli. I don't know what they were asking for for Enrique, but clearly a Spanish club was happy to pay it, or at least felt it was a workable amount, since they approached Enrique and discussed terms. All of these three have been rumored (or confirmed) to have been approached by clubs, so I'm not sure why you automatically think the club is holding out for them. At the very least, drop Borini out of this discussion, as the club agreed fees for him 3 times.

Can we keep the goal post where they are instead of moving them? Did I say anywhere near close to 135 million good supporters? I said the majority aren't bad. That means just 68 million have to actually follow Chelsea because it's their favorite team. Also, just because a fan started following a team because of X doesn't mean that after years of watching the team they still need X to be a follower.

Thats everyone from GPs to A&amp;E consultants and everyone in between.  For all the perception of doctors earning lots and playing golf there's little doubt in my mind that there's easier ways of making a living than medicine.

The entirety of the NHS is suffering from ever rising demand and inadequate resources.  Medical jobs are often stressful by their nature but are made that bit worse by the fact there's shortages of staff and facilities. Despite this people are still willing to embark on a huge degree/specialisation and accrue huge debts to work as a doctor, knowing fine well they're going to be worked like dogs and have politicians talk shite about them.  

Doctors do it and put up with all the shite because they like helping people, that's pretty admirable and undoubtedly positive.

IF, IF IF we had a fit Sturridge and bought Bony its not even certain that we'd break top 4,  but isnt a part of Rodgers' job to cope with ins and outs? Injuries and bannings? Isnt that why he has a squad? With players he all sanctioned, but not necessarily wanted. So what? He knew what he was getting himself into with this job and the committee so there's no reason to defend him on that. Besides, shouldn't a top manager be able to work with and get the best out of the resources he has to his disposal? Djimi Traore has a Champions League medal for fucks sake.

Instead Rodgers lets out whispers through his mates in the media that the committee bound his hands, and instead of working with what he has, he alienates the ones he doesnt like and happily throws them under the bus.. Moreno is supposedly allowed to leave sue to defensive frailties and a poor season, yet he starts Lovren at the Britannia..

First things first the job would be classed as being in 'Solihull', as although Solihull has a town centre, it's also a borough (see the borough outlined here: http://imgur.com/0U6BB6V).

The commute, as you're not going anywhere near Birmingham city centre, won't be bad at all. For example it wont take you an hour to get from some really nice parts of Solihull to work in the morning. If you see here, a commute from the centre of Solihull tomorrow morning, going to work, doesn't take long (I understand Google uses historic traffic information to give a rough idea of how long a route will take at a specific time in the future!) http://imgur.com/12180mg

So I ask three personal questions:

Ideally a 30 second commute would be perfect, but realistically how long would you be happy to commute for, for the ideal place to live? 10, 20, 30 minutes? 

What's your budget? Although this end of Birmingham is cheap, there's a huge variety in terms of quality and prices. 

What kind of lifestyle are you looking for? Are the kind of person who likes a drink on the weekend? What does an area need to be for you, for you to think, I like it around here? 

If you would let me know what kind of abode (house, flat), the budget, the kind of lifestyle/area you'd like to live in, and a realistic commute time you'd push to those things to be 'perfect', then I'm more than happy to kind of give you a run down of your options. 

A bit like location, location, location!

If they're incorrect they shouldn't be on the product, or  note should be included at the lease with your package informing you of the correct ingredients. It is a legal obligation to make sure cosmetics sold in the EU have either ingredients labelling on the bottle, or if the item is loose or too small a leaflet with that information. 

Just sounds like BS: they're either too lazy to make up new labels right now and hoped no one would notice, or they're waiting on new labels to come back from the printers in which case they're playing at fuckery as they could of covered up the old ingredients list with an Avery label and put a leaflet in your parcel with the correct ingredients listing and a brief explanation. 

This does not sit well with me. When it comes to food and skin care people need *correct* ingredients lists so they can decide whether or not that product is suitable for them, eg allergies/ known unwanted reactions or whatever. 

The ingredients must be listed in INCI format, but if there is not an INCI equivalent name for an ingredient then there are other naming schemes that can be used. 

As far as I'm aware this all applies to cosmetic products supplied to (as in a distributer who imports the stuff to sell on, as opposed to individuals buying stuff from outside the EU on Amazon or wherever), and produced for sale within the EU. 

An option would be to report them to trading standards.

Don't worry though crime is falling and we are crying wolf as Teresa May has said. Or as others say here we are too busy policing Twitter and stoners.

You need to persist and allow the police to do their job, if you have evidence the allocated OIC will view it and possibly seize it. If you go public with it yourself before it is seized some evidential value will be lost when it comes to ID procedures etc. 

You should hear from the officer dealing with you're crime report soon. Expect updates to be few and far between, it's a volume crime and frankly the people who did it will probably be know right away by the police.

The downfall began when Henderson was sent off against City I believe, who was so integral to our midfield. I put it down to Henderson being sent off, obviously Suarez being banned from numerous games and some bad managerial strategies on Rodgers' behalf.

Llanelli is right on the coastal path so there's that. Plus Pembrey Country Park is just down the road. It is dotted with WW2 bunkers and features Cefn Sidan beach which is great. It's a few quid to get in or you can park just outside and walk in for free.

Not far from the good end of the M4 is Llyn Lleich Owain Country Park (in Gorslas, near Cross Hands). Just head for the huge TV mast. It's a nice walk around a lake. Nice play area for the kids and decent cafe too. Parking is a few quid.

Normally it would be Ox/Walcott on the right and Alexis on the left, but Wenger decided to not start Alexis and I hope he won' for next 2-3 weeks so he can fully prepare for the season. But even though - it's nothing surprising to play with more midfielders in Arsenal, and that's because we can control the game more and our full backs can provide good balls from the wings, that's why sometimes we can see Ramsey or Ozil on the wing or sometimes we play with offensive full back like Bellerin and then we put Welbeck (who's still injured as well, I forgot about him) on the wing, because he is a hard worker and defendes well. I'm not the biggest fan of putting Ozil or Ramsey on the wing, it mostly pays off, but Ozil is way better in the middle and I think he will, he played basically as second striker versus you, I'm not absolutely sure about that idea, but it might work out, it just needs time. I'm really hoping Wilshere will be fit this season, I prefer him over Ramsey. But back to the topic - the only way to play with 2 wingers vs you was to put Ox on the left and Walcott on the right, but Wenger wouldn't have anyone to sub in when it's needed. Normally we have Oxlade, Walcott, Welbeck, Sanchez, Gnabry that are supposed to play as wingers (+ Wilshere who imo can play there effectively). This squad was supposed to keep the tempo of the game, but it failed, the subs didn't bring enough energy, you guys played how you should against Arsenal, which is defend deeply, so we can't walk it in, there wasn't that much space for long shots and even if it were not many players decide to shoot from long distance anyway, maybe Ramsey, but he played very poorly in my opinion.

null,null,rappersdo,,These days if you say you support Corbyn...,null,"Blair seems to have taken it upon himself to be the voice of the right of the party masquerading as the centre, despite knowing how much he is despised. 

He sees Corbyn as a sideshow and the entire article was patronising as fuck to anyone, like myself, who is supporting Corbyn.

He says it's laughable that Corbyn doesn't offer anything new, but to paint himself as some kind of principled centrist after his record in government is what's really laughable. 

He still speaks in vague riddles. When he was elected he framed left-wing polices in right wing rhetoric, and it worked but people have wised up to it now. 

The idea that a party in government can't protest is ludicrous. In Blair's eyes Labour's meant to be a broad church, where the left is seen and not heard &amp; continues to offer it's support to a party which abandoned it long ago. Apart from Corbyn have any of the other candidates spoke at rallies? This whole 'modernisation' shit is now just a code word for 'Shift right and fuck the north.'

He talks of how some of Corbyn's supporters ""Disdain government."" Which is bullshit, I disdain *the* government and I think Blair changed the political landscape in regards to spin and is one of the reasons people hate politicians so much now. 

To say that the majority of Labour members/supporters(if you believe polls) are voting for Corbyn out of spite, idiocy or lunacy just shows how incredibly out of touch he really is. Nevermind the fact he thinks Scotland was lost due to nationalism alone.

null,null,imdrinkingteaatwork,lfc99,null,null,"&gt; that there hasn't been much progress under Rodgers

Playing beautiful football isn't progress?  Coming second isn't progress?

&gt; and that when it was time to build on that fantastic season and progress further, we did pretty much the exact opposite.

You expected progress after losing our two best players without adequately replacing them?  We reinvested in depth and Rodgers did not get the attacking players he wanted for *HIS* system.  How can you then blame him?  Sure he should manage with what he has... and I think being that close to top four with what we had is understandable.  

&gt; IF, IF IF we had a fit Sturridge and bought Bony its not even certain that we'd break top 4, but isnt a part of Rodgers' job to cope with ins and outs? Injuries and bannings? Isnt that why he has a squad? With players he all sanctioned, but not necessarily wanted. 

First, it is certain (as much as speculation can be).  We barely missed out on top four and the only reason we did not was goals.    A lot of things happened last year, and of course Rodgers could have done better, but he is not this terrible manager you and others like you are making him out to be.  You cannot blame injuries on him and you ESPECIALLY cannot blame the backups on him.  Rodgers did not want Balotelli but accepted him when no other options were available/allocated; how can you then expect him to succeed with someone he did not want for *HIS* system.  Sure it would have been nice, and showed him a[n even] more astute manager, but you should not necessarily EXPECT that from him.  That's just silly.  Managers know/think they know who will fit their systems best, and when they don't get players to fit those systems you blame them?  Managers can't really work with nothing.

&gt; So what? He knew what he was getting himself into with this job and the committee so there's no reason to defend him on that. 

What?  He knew he wouldn't get players he wanted?  Doubtful.  And Rodgers definitely didn't go into this job thinking he would be undermined; in fact it was the opposite.  He expressly said he would not work with a director of football and the committee kind of morphed into something similar.

&gt;Djimi Traore has a Champions League medal for fucks sake.

Shut up.  What a stupid thing to say.  Traore was not as terrible as people like you make out, nor was he the same kind of integral to a team as a goalscorer that plays a certain type of way.

&gt; and instead of working with what he has, he alienates the ones he doesnt like and happily throws them under the bus..

Seems to be working with Coutinho fine?  The rest is stupid speculation.  Which I have come to expect from people like you that's first reaction is to blame Rodgers.

&gt; Moreno is supposedly allowed to leave sue to defensive frailties and a poor season, yet he starts Lovren at the Britannia..

Hi all.
I am currently working on a new build in a custom case, so need to break my rig and shift all the parts that will not fit in the new one (pretty much everything!) Due to finances I'm likely stuck with my CPU (3770s) but need to switch to a board with voltage control. The rest is up for swap or sale but the parts I'm after are pretty specific.
Up for grabs I have:
Silverstone FT03 Mini -Black
Silverstone 450W Gold SFX PSU
Palit GTX 680 - Reference type cooler
Gigabyte H77-N WIFi -would need a Z77 board to replace.
Zalman CPNS2 cooler. 
StreacomF7c Evo case, Streacom power brick and generic PicoPSU {broke the streacom one getting it back in the box! :-(  

Also have a Sony slim slot-load Blu-Ray Drive plus a pair of 750GB Seagate XT Hybrid drives but I guess they are pretty much worthless these days.

All parts are in good working order with no damage, will be well cleaned and packed in original boxes. Usual ebay small-print, cash on collection or paypal and I'll work out postage. As per the title I would be interested in any &lt;17cm GTX 750ti or 960, and 1155 ITX MoBO with voltage control. Any more info needed drop me a message :)

null,null,Screenager1988,null,null,null,"I don't dislike Corbyn. I think he's a thoroughly decent human being and all things being equal I agree with some of his policies. I do think Marx has something to say about society, I do think unions have been unfairly demonised (though they do it to themselves sometimes), I would love to see the natural monopolies heavily regulated if not completely state owned, I would love to see continued investment in education and in the young. 

The problem is, is that these things can only be done if you win power and I don't think that Corbyn can, sure he might win a few green votes and some snp votes - but even if both of those votes collapsed and went ENTIRELY to labour and labour leaked nothing else to the tories or UKIP they would still NOT win a majority.

So to answer your question. Is Liz Kendall better? Well I think so and for a few simple reasons. I don't think she's a tory, and anyone who does doesn't know what a tory is. She's for a higher minimum wage, she's for putting trade unions on the boards of companies, shes for extending the use of cooperatives in public services - which actually seems to be incredibly radical. What's more than that she doesn't seem to be electorally poisonous. I do actually believe she could put the labour party on track to win, maybe not in 2020 - but in 2025. I think that Burnham and Cooper could do this too, really anyone but Corbyn. 

Really what I think this comes down to is that the labour party still hasn't forgiven itself for winning 3 elections in a row - and destroying the Tory party for a decade. At some point during the long tenure of Kinnock and Smith the labour party realised that what happened was what you do, not how you do it. This led to the abolition of useless things like Clause 4, it led to the party being open to dialogue with the private sector and it led to the victories in 97, 01 and 05. More than victories though it led to all those Labour values being advanced. Child poverty went down, education got better, the health service got better, public services got better. What was Blair and Brown's reward by the membership? Villification. 

Was it perfect? No, but we did win and we did put policies in place that helped society. Whats better a 100% of nothing or 50% of something huge?


TLDR: Yes I really think Liz Kendall is better, but that might be because I actually know her policies, I know shes not a tory and she has a chance of actually implementing something.",null,1,null,1439405591,null,null,false,0,cu0oqzf,null,t3_3gpmen,null,null,null,t1_cu0nmwq,null,null,null,1440439885,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

---
&gt;
&gt;The Cult of Skaro were assigned the task of furthering the Dalek cause through the development of new and unorthodox ideas and strategies. Dalek Sec claimed that it was created to ""imagine new ways of survival"". (TV: *Daleks in Manhattan*) Their willingness to adopt alien modes of thought was demonstrated by the fact that they had individual names, a concept most Daleks found abhorrent. Led by Sec, the Black Dalek, they answered to no one, not even the Dalek Emperor, although they still revered him. (TV: *Doomsday*)
&gt;The Cult of Skaro were at first just four ordinary Daleks. Dalek Sec was a commander of the Seventh Incursion Squad sent to wipe out the remnants of the Mechanoids which they succeeded in doing. Dalek Caan was an Attack Squad Leader of the Thirteenth Assault Group. Dalek Thay was the commandant of Station Alpha, the most secret Dalek research facility. Dalek Jast was a Force Leader of the Outer Rim Defensive Battalion. After doing this all four of them were promoted to become the Cult of Skaro. They were given their names — making them the only Daleks with names — and Dalek Sec was chosen to be their leader. (PROSE: *Birth of a Legend*)

They told us there is 'no other way' than to charge more fees for university, but now it's not looking like such a good deal, where the universities mostly went straight to the max. £9k (shock!) instead of what they said, which was 'only a few would.'  Also, money isn't being paid back by anything like as much as they thought (half?), and quite a lot of the rest must be being swallowed up by the huge admin overheads.

East coast train line:  was it really necessary to spend so much on it out of the public purse and privatise it again at a time when it was making a good profit?

They've convinced enough of us to be afraid of a step to the left to win an election.  But not all of us.  I think Corbyn, whether he leads the party or not, and whether he's still around for the next election or not, has made a very useful contribution to British politics by giving us an alternative to the neo-liberal narrative we've had rammed down our throats by the Tories and the Establishment in general.

Well... It's certainly used in a derogatory sense by people on the right, but I don't think it's exclusively used for that purpose. I describe myself as a leftist. Anyway, I wasn't going to say ""no"" because of semantics. The sentiment that you were getting at was that there's a hard left strain of thought that has gained prominence within the Labour party over the past few weeks. To that I say: yes.

&gt;Almost every politican agrees we were wrong to invade Iraq, the evidence is right there, you're just to set in your ways to see it.

It's not unusual for a majority of politicians to agree with the majority of the public, and my becoming in favour of the war in Iraq was a recent thing. That's not to say that I deny that the government of the time lied to bring it about - I just don't care that they did.

&gt;To say Scotland was all about nationalism is to ignore the fact the SNP promised they wouldn't run on an independence ticket. 

Sorry but that doesn't follow at all. There's more to nationalism that independence, and they'd literally had a referendum less than half a year ago. They were elected because the Scottish people broadly wanted people in Parliament who they knew would make *sure* that the promised devolution was delivered. That's nationalism.

Labour campaigning with the Tories was probably a mistake in hindsight, but that's largely about tribalism.

Same with Charlie Austin...would he score a lot of goals at Chelsea? Probably not. It doesn't matter he has a ""proven track record"", because he is kind of an average player.

From my original post, that's more what I was getting at. We don't NEED a 20mil signing right now, I'd argue we barely need a 10m or 12m signing unless VVD costs that much. We needed Tadic, Mane, Bertrand, Pelle, and maaaaybe Long so we splashed the cash, as we had just lost Chambers, Lambert, Lallana, and Shaw. We spent what we did on Bertrand because he was proving to be one of the best left backs in the PL and wanted to join us permanently. I'll admit Forster might have been a bit extravagant, but the club didn't rate Boruc, Kev, or Gazza, and it's looking like a just fine move, if a bit expensive. 

Romeu is the kind of signing we could use, even if he's not incredibly exciting. He knows the PL, will backup Wanyama happily and provide much needed EL and cup depth.

True I suppose and I concede to your comparison and for evidence I somewhat base it on this: http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/08/why-did-labour-lose (I'd say my mother is between Settler and Pioneer but more towards Settler). If people thought/perceived Ed Miliband and Ed Balls were economically incompetent on being not ""tough on the deficit"" for instance how will Corbyn fare with more spending in general? Sure Osborne's economic plans are basically ""2.5% increase on pensions regardless of income despite going towards deflation and £ 13 billion pensioner bonds and eliminating the deficit to win elections"" 

&gt;In what way has Corbyn been shown to be incompetent? 

I am not saying he is incompetent (I used air quotes, maybe I should of said ""economic competence"" or to that effect) but if the public think ""oh god Labour is going looney with spending on scroungers"" (don't get me wrong I get annoyed by this sentiment) due to Corbyn then Labour are going to be damaged in elections. It's basically all about perception which matters a lot and won the election and why the polls were suspicious (for instance people perceived Cameron and Osborne to be preferable to Miliband and Balls in general though said they would vote Labour) which pretty much give evidence . Due to his views on immigration that would likely be viewed as ""light touch"" (again, I disagree on that) then he is very unlikely to gain settler votes that drifted to UKIP mainly.

Think of it this way. This is how i had to describe it to someone once. 

If William Hartnell's character called himself ""The Doctor"", and then Patrick Troughton's character called himself ""The Physician"", then Jon Pertwee's character called himself ""The Surgeon"", and then Tom Baker's character called himself ""The Doctor""...that would make Tom Baker the ***Second*** Doctor. Because while he'd be Fourth ***incarnation*** of the character, he was only the second incarnation to use the name ""The Doctor.

""The Doctor"" is a name the character chose for himself during his young William Hartnell days, and he kept calling himself the Doctor until the end of his Eighth life. Up until this point the number of Doctors was in sync with the number of incarnations. 

John Hurt was the ninth incarnation but because he didn't call himself the Doctor during that time he didn't count as ""The Ninth Doctor"". He didn't start calling himself ""the Doctor"" again until after he'd regenerated into his tenth incarnation, played by Christopher Eccleston. Christopher Eccleston's character was the ninth one to use the name the Doctor, so he became ""the Ninth Doctor"".

I've no doubt it contributed. Just like there's a handful of English people who would be won over by that. The SNP were also in a much more convenient position to offer populist shite like that, particularly during a growth period.

Open a Nationwide Flexdirect account - 5% on £2.5k for the first year with £1k a month pay in.
Open two TSB Classic Plus accounts - 5% on 2K (no end date) with £500 a month pay in.
Open a Santander 123 account for the rest. £2 a month and requires 2 direct debits and £500 a month pay in but pays 3% on your type of remaining balance.

You then on a day (say 10th of each month) send £1k in a cycle like this: Santander -&gt; Nationwide -&gt;TSB1 -&gt; TSB2 -&gt; Santander.  It takes 5 minutes to do it manually or just have standing orders to do it all automatically for you like I do.  I then on the first of the month, cream all the interest from the accounts that are maxed out and put it into another saving account / my spend account.  When the Flex Direct account stops paying 5%, that can then either be switched for another paying current account or closed and the money put back into a savings account.

Large amounts of overtime may well be fine on an *ad hoc* basis, and you may reasonably be required to fulfil those duties, but if it's regular and ongoing then it contravenes the EWTD.

Generally, unless your contract specifies otherwise, meal and rest breaks are not part of your working hours, and neither is your travel to a regular place of work. Travel to sites, on the other hand, may well be 'working hours', to which you are entitled to pay and which will be covered by the EWTD.

It was a harsh result with a lot of positives to take away. On another day we could have walked away with 3 points, so although the defeat is disheartening, I still have a lot of faith in us staying up this year.


    The appointment of Alex Neil in January had a massive impact on results. How do you think he will handle himself in the Premier League?
    
He'll do fine. He has the players motivated, and has been able to get the best out of players who had been struggling under our previous two managers (like Bradley Johnson and Nathan Redmond). I've no doubt he'll be able to adapt quickly to the Premier League.


    Who are the Norwich players that fans should be keeping an eye on this season?
    
Nathan Redmond has been showing consistent improvement for quite some time, and I really think it might be his breakthrough season in the top flight. Jonny Howson is another player who when fit is able to win games almost single handedly at times. We definitely have strength in midfield. 


    You’re rumoured to be looking for a striker at the moment. Who’s on your shopping list before the window closes?
    
Allegedly Mattia Destro, which seems incredible to me. Other than that, I'd like us to get another CB before the end of the transfer window.


    The last time both teams met, the game finished 0 - 0. What’s your prediction for the game?
    
I'm going to be biased and say 2-1 Norwich. I think we'll hit the ground running this time out and will get two first half goals, before a tense final 20.


    Sunderland are one of the favourites for relegation. What are your thoughts on Sunderland’s chances this year, and what do you make of their squad?
    
They've been favourites I think for a few years and they keep holding on, so it's hard to dismiss them. There is some established players like Fletcher who are always a danger, and Rodwell who might be a dark horse after a lack of playing time at City.

1) The loss vs Palace was unfortunate, the way we played and in light of the decision to rule out Jerome's goal, we were at least good for a point.


2) Neil surprised us all last season and if our opener against Palace is anything to go by, we can imagine that we are playing a very positive style of football - at least against the clubs closer to our ability. I think he will do well for us provided that our strikeforce can do a good enough job.


3) I can't believe I'm saying this really as Redmond has been very inconsistent since joining us, but he's been looking very good since the end of last season - could definitely have an impact if he turns up. Howson is very good going forward and is an absolute engine in midfield, Johnson despite being out wide still challenges for absolutely everything and actually learned to shoot some time last season.


4) No one realistic has really caught my imagination this summer. We're currently linked with Dwight Gayle but I think we're running out of options. Have also been linked with Mattia Destro more recently, which would be fantastic but I don't really see it happening.


5) I feel a 0-2! Perhaps a bit optimistic, but you seemed poor last weekend so could be a good opportunity to pick up the first win.


6) To me your squad seems quite dated. I've always rated Larsson and Kaboul, and I think Rodwell can be good. I'm afraid I think your squad isn't good enough to come good and I put you to finish 18th.

What part of Blairism should we go back to? 97 Blair? 2005 Blair? Or the Blair of 2015?

Labour cosying up to The City ended up poisoning the well for Labour for the past two elections - and worse has been framed in the public mind as 'public spending gone mad', when really it was pretty much ideologically the opposite of that. The idea that Labour can somehow go back to that disastrous approach after it's failure was so publicly shown is completely untenable.

What we should take from the 97 Blair era is the message of hope.

I know a lot of people find it hard to believe, but gay marriage isn't the be all and end all of LGBT+ rights, and even if we're just looking at those New Labour has Cameron beaten hands down. Gay marriage is a step up from civil partnerships sure, but then you factor in repealing Section 28, an equal age of consent, lifting the ban on lesbian and gay people serving in the military, new laws on hate crime, The Gender Recognition Act and laws on gay adoption. 


Meanwhile Cameron hides behind getting gay marriage through and hopes we ignore the problems trans folk face even with this new legislation, his near constant hiring of and allying with homophobes, a refusal to ally with Labour to include LGBT-positive sex education in schools and the fact that the Tories austerity (namely cuts to mental health services and housing benefits for young people) disproportionately affect LGBT+ youth.",null,0,null,1439409062,null,null,false,0,cu0r71i,null,t3_3gqxsq,null,null,null,t1_cu0pqxz,null,null,null,1440441037,null,8,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,8,null

That doesn't mean that the country couldn't possibly be convinced of an alternative. When you present Corbyn's plans next to Tory cuts it's not just a matter about how fast and how deep, but a different methodology. It would of course be down to Corbyn to build support around his plans.
It's entirely possible that Corbyn doesn't manage to do that, a lot would depend on how the economy develops over the next 4 years. However, if the economy is considered the breaking point for Labours electability, then what solution are the others offering? Honestly, they haven't presented anything radically different.

Brown at the time was described as austerity-lite by Corbyn and co. And that alone is not what makes Corbyn hard left. Furthermore, hard left or not, the public don't support anti-austerity. This sucks. However, it's not easy to shift public opinion, especially not from Opposition.

If it means gaining an extra £5000 a year at the misery of others or at a marginal, possibly irreversible destruction of my environment that may affect my kids, my kids' friends, and their kids and so on, then no I don't wish to be better off.

I honestly don't need much more than what I have now, and I think if a lot more people took a step back from themselves, took a look at what they truly need to be happy and what they could get rid of in their lives, then everyone would be much happier.

Our obsession with consumption-led GDP growth doesn't convince me. That new iPhone may grow the economy slightly, but versus the old iPhone it isn't particularly revolutionary. The demand wasn't there, the supply was create as well as the marketing and the demand followed. That's a false economy.

Why do you remember the Tory party, split by scandal, racked by infighting, every policy backfiring under voters.

Simply put this narrative is not the whole story. The Tories had made progress in NI, Ken Clarke's macroeconomic policy was slowly working (so well it was copied until 2001). But Labour pushed the narrative, they worked as a close unit (with Blair and Brown holding both the wings together) and got the media on their side

Bear in mind in 1992 John Major got more votes than any political party before or since - Kinnock was seen in some quarters as a shoe-in. Overcoming an incumbent government is often difficult. That Blair did it by such a large margin was credit to his shadow cabinet team and his organisation.

null,null,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,null,"I think a key aspect of match threads is why people use them. Personally, it comes down to two aspects:

1) To read comments

2) Because I'm away somewhere without my PC, have no option for watching the game and therefore want something I can check on my mobile.

My issue for 1 with the live match threads is that the comments don't refresh, so I have to refresh manually anyway which kind of renders the whole thing slightly irrelevant. Then my issue for 2 is that, at least the last time I tried to view a live thread on my phone (which admittedly was bloody ages ago), it didn't work particularly well - if someone can vouch otherwise with newer experience then I'm happy to concede it's fine and not a problem. 

All that said, from personal experience running match threads, the regular post format is an utter shit to keep updated and for that alone I'm happy for people to use live threads instead. I really don't think many people care strongly enough one way or the other to justify keeping a format that's a pain in the ass for the one person actually putting the effort in.

Unrelated, but on the topic of match threads, I agree with a different comment echoed by /u/redadil4 that there should be some sort of schedule. Doing a match thread properly is a fair bit of an investment of an afternoon in comparison to chilling out on the sofa or in a pub with a beer and the footy on TV. I'd be much more keen to do it more often if I could be certain in advance that I'm definitely doing it or not doing it. Otherwise I'll tend to just assume someone else will and settle down on the sofa, and even when there's five minutes and still no thread I'm reluctant to step in because I've already got the mindset that I'm not doing it, and don't want to spend the effort making the thread if someone else is going to post their own while I'm halfway through setting up (as has happened at least three or four times). 

On the other hand, if I know 48+ hours beforehand I'm doing the match thread then it's no big deal for me and I'll typically enjoy it and have my shit in order to do it properly. And I'll know not to invite mates round to watch the game if I'm going to be spending the time on Reddit running the thread instead. 

Plus, as the [stats I took a while back showed](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2nvfgv/match_thread_discussion_thread/), most match threads are done between a pretty small number of people, with a lot of the rest being people who stepped in because there wasn't one. I don't think it would be that difficult to coordinate between the five or six people who seem happy to do it regularly, and having a bit more structure would probably encourage a few more to help out and distribute the load a bit. It's not in the traditional ethos of ""person to make it first, does it"" of match threads, but I'm happy to see the subreddit scrap that if it means we have guaranteed and high quality threads every game.

Yes, if Sturridge, Coutinho, Firmino and Benteke all live up to their full capabilities they'd be one of the best attacking line ups in the league. However, there are huge question marks over how Sturridge will return from his injuries and I feel we really haven't seen enough of Firmino and Benteke in red to say, absolutely, that they'll make the goalscoring impact we need. Even if they do gel with the squad perfectly, I still think it's not as strong as Sturridge, Sterling, Suarez, Coutinho but it's certainly an improvement on what we had last year.

Our bench has definitely improved in midfield and attack but there is still an alarming lack of depth in defense. No dedicated RB backup, an 18 yr old CB brand new to the league seemingly forcing a Europa League winner out at LB. The potential sale of what should be our first choice CB, with a 34 yr old and the aforementioned 18 yr old the only other choices (where is Ilori again?).

&gt; “Even with a **cautious estimate of prices remaining at $113 a barrel** being used, it’s clear that Scottish oil and gas could generate more revenues than has previously been assumed.”

You're quite right in thinking that the choices facing Scotland would be hideous; slash public spending or raise taxes by around 16% to keep the deficit comparable to the rest of the UK's, or continue with current tax-and-spend and run something like an 8% deficit (around three times the EU-recommended maximum).

I don't really have any issue with the Jewish Chronicle, seeing as all they've done is post an article. Whereas you've posted three in 24 hours and keep running in circles with the same talking points, but if it makes you happy I have just contacted them to find out why they don't do some actual journalism and pose those questions directly rather than leaving the article there. 

I'll let you know how they respond, but I suspect, much as I do with you, that unanswered questions are better to them than actual responses. As it allows them to smugly wallow in their assumptions than face having to have an actual dialogue.

Letting the Labour party split again might go some way to fixing this. A smaller reformed Labour party that doesn't challenge in Scotland could probably find a way to work with the SNP. You could even see three-way politics with the Liberal Dems?

That formation is more like a 4 -1-3-1 plus Zouma just going wherever Fellaini is. 

I would argue that Ramires is a better counter towards sterling because he has the pace to track back in place of willian when necessary. But he would be much less effective at stopping Toure. At the same time, I remember distinctly Matic's Chelsea debut in which Matic absolutely shut down Yaya. Hopefully he can do it again.

Without a doubt, Man City's game plan is going to abuse Sterling at Ivanovic's side, and of course Mou knows that. I'm guessing he's going to tell Ivanovic to stay back, which is a pity cuz (remember Ivanovic's left foot goal two years ago against city in that 1-0 win?) 

It would be cool to stick with our normal squad and have Oscar at CAM and Fabregas at CDM. but I guess the whole point of players like Ramires, Mikel is to give Mou more options.

It all depends on what Poch is looking for in those positions. We need people who can create. We have people, Harry and Christian (if he came Yarmolenko as well), who are reliable finishers. But we lack creativity. Personally, I'd want Lamela creating.

EDIT Top tips in advance of the big day:

1. If you are unsure of anything call the uni. Don't hold off, some stuff can be sorted in the next couple of.days but not after that. Call us. 

2. If you didnt make your offers.dont panic. You have the option of clearing but try to keep a clear head. Going to uni for the sake of it isn't worth it. Your alternatives are generally harder at first but get easier. But think about it, is 3+ more years of study that is only going to get harder right for you? Is it the only way to your goal? Just because there is a degree with a name that sounds like it gets you the job you want doesn't mean you need it. Sound engineering is a good example, the degree won't get you a job, the experience you have will. 

3. If you have confirmed your place, before you celebrate, check what you need to do. There may be some things you can do right away. Don't put them off until your sleeping off a party. Do them today.

null,null,alanwbrown,null,null,null,"Let’s pick a point in Edinburgh, Haymarket Station, Google Maps says it is 53.6 miles to Glasgow Airport

Call it 50 miles, 100 miles return. 

Let's assume a middle range car returning 35mpg*, again let's assume a very low, just recently reduced to cost of 111p per litre of petrol. 

That returns an actual fuel cost of £16.96, however as we have a assumed a western pickup point and knocked off over 6 miles on the distance we will call that £17.00

Without any parking fee at Glasgow Airport, unlikely in my opinion, the driver is £7.00 better off. However there is no wear and tear allowance or insurance costs involved in this calculation. 

Let's look at the cost of a taxi, from Edinburgh to Glasgow Airport the cost is £145.00, private hire car, perhaps £125.00.

So why are people saying it sounds dodgy? Because it is. A person such as is being described obviously doesn't have a ""hire or reward"" type vehicle insurance as is required by taxi drivers, driving instructors and other people who drive for a living.


 So if this:

“First of all this is Edinburgh, Scotland, this is not happening here , as a matter of fact these scenarios statistically are not happening at all, this was taught by media who exaggerate single incidents.
This is a small business of a brother and his sister, they invested in two nice new cars, they advertise and are a registered company.”



is true, just publish the name, email, website, company number of the business and people will be able to make their own decisions as to if they wish to travel in a vehicle that costs 17% of the cost of a taxi.

It explains some of the reasons FSG implemented this system (a lot of it is devoted to LFC's shite signings before King Kenny took over).  The problem with the old fashioned mentality is that lack of stability in the role of manager causes managers to break the bank trying to keep their own arses employed without any long term vision for the future of the club.  I think while the committee model has been somewhat shambolic for us the last few years, there is a very clever mentality in its implementation.

The upside is that you supposedly have a group that cares more about the long term success rather than a manager who will splash loads of cash for iffy signings because their own interests are instant success rather than sustained growth.  The major drawback is if your manager has problems with your purchases, it can create this sort of problem.",null,0,null,1439412959,null,null,false,0,cu0tupd,null,t3_3gp4l0,null,null,null,t1_cu061kw,null,null,null,1440442355,null,3,null,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

One important one that regularly gets missed off the lists is police ""welfare checks"".  The police regularly wake up homeless people at about 6am and move them on.  If they don't recognise somebody they usually ask for ID, run a Police National Computer check for outstanding warrants/ missing person, officially it's to make sure that the person has survived the night.  When they do this they usually give a receipt.  That slip six months later can be used as proof of a connection to the borough.  (Westminster police have since late last year been ordered NOT to give them out as Westminster council doesn't want any more claimants.)  If he's got one from a previous bout of homelessness he can use that or he can get a copy from the station that issued it.  If he doesn't have a previous bout of homelessness and is reasonably corpus mentus ""No Second Night Out"" can be good.  It's run by St. Mungos and paid for by the ""Mayor of London"".  They will try to rehouse him/ ""reconnect him back to his local area"" but usually only take people who have been street homeless for less than three days although there are exceptions.  They'll except either a referral from a recognised body/ self referral or referral from the public at large.  They don't do the three ticket system.

Oh completely. But Sturridge is one of the best strikers in the league when he is fit, which maybe justifies us being a bit more patient with his injuries. When fit, Sturridge is a guaranteed start - for Enrique it's maybe the case but it's a lot more up in the air. Not to mention Sturridge being four years younger probably buys him a bit of time (age seems to have helped Flanno too). 

&gt; He seems happy at Liverpool and appears to be doing everything he can to get over his injuries and try get back into the team, I don't begrudge him that.

Me neither - it's not his fault he's injured and unlike some other fans seem to think, I doubt that laying off instagram would heal his knee any quicker. That said, there's only so long you can wait for someone to finally get fit before it starts to look like you're better to just cut your losses.

&gt;At a nomination meeting in one of Corbyn’s neighbouring seats in North London, a woman hitherto unseen at party meetings, arguing against another woman urging support for Yvette Cooper, proclaimed that Corbyn was the only choice because **‘I care more about  socialism than power.’** I am sure David Cameron says amen to that. To hear people say ‘it doesn’t matter if we win’ is to see people for whom political choice is about what makes them as individuals feel better, not what might make the country a better place. The sincerity of the belief in great causes, and the desire for change, is clear among the Corbyn crowds. But none of that change can come from Opposition. - See more at: http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2015/08/10/nice-guy-good-mp-making-the-weather-but-it-has-to-be-abc-anyone-but-corbyn-labour-is-finished-if-he-wins/#sthash.uxBIR3zq.dpuf",null,0,null,1439414345,null,null,false,0,cu0uqni,null,t3_3gqxtq,null,null,null,t1_cu0tpj9,null,null,null,1440442773,null,9,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

However, shoplifting not only does nothing to solve the causes of starvation, it makes things worse for the shoplifter - so I can't advocate it.",null,1,null,1439415061,null,null,false,0,cu0v7fc,null,t3_3gqqbl,null,null,null,t1_cu0v60e,null,null,null,1440442992,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Because we are still a laughing stock. They just laugh in private now.

You may not have heard it, but you can see the merriment in stock bounces after the government sells off services to their mates well below their value. When the public purse takes a £1billion loss on saving a bank before handing it back to the people who caused it to fail, someone *somewhere* is laughing very hard.

Who reaps the profits from high British utility bills? France state company EDF, German-based E.ON and Npower, Spain-based Scottish Power, and only British Gas and SSE cream their profits off into *British* private hands. 

What about trains? Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern, London Midland, and Southeastern are owned by Govia. Govia is a joint venture between the Keolis and Go-Ahead. Keolis is owned by the French Société nationale des chemins de fer français and the Canadian Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. Abellio is obviously owned by the Dutch Nederlandse Spoorwegen.

Property? There's a lot of people from all over buying up empty luxury penthouses in London, being told that they can expect a 20-25% return on investment just holding on to an empty flat for a few years.

Hell, even the private businesses. When you shop at Sainsbury's, you're helping fund fucking *Quatar*, who own 25% of the company though their sovereign wealth fund. It would sure be great if Britain had had a historic opportunity to use oil wealth to establish something like that!

Where can you get people to pay a fortune for their house, their power, their travel? Where can you buy up monopoly services and use the profits to fund your own state investment?

Britain!

If in this situation you will use the ''how can i trust your review/how do i know this is not a scam'' argument then the answer lies in my previous reply.

My point is, you can't isolate yourself from every human that doesn't have a company tag on his shirt, this is a new invention introduced in modern culture where everything is branded and if it isn't then its on its way to kill you and take your money, and the worst thing is, this approach to not trust one another is not applied evenly, what I mean is; there are many situations in which you should be suspicious but aren't simply because you are not suspecting others to commit a crime. 

Let me give you an example: 

Private flat sharing adverts on gumtree - This is actually worse than spending a two hour drive with a stranger, in this scenario you live with a stranger. You leave all your belongings with this guy you don't know and you sleep under the same roof! 

Purchasing a used car from someone - Sure the MOT is valid for another few months but what if this is the reason he wants to sell his car ?! Maybe the brakes are faulty and it is an accident waiting to happen ? 

We rely on each other everyday and it is important to not discriminate between different scenarios when the risk is the same. It is simply not logical to accept one example of the same type of risk and then dispute another one just because it is more represented in media (Because when was the last time you have ever head someone being captured in Scotland in a car, and compare that to how often this is presented in movies/games/books). It's like a vegetarian presenting his disgust of someone who eats chicken wile he himself is consuming beef.

But not the kind of thing you do *again* right after; so I agree that it's time for the Doctor who grew out of that whirligig of challenges.  The trailer promises that Doctor -- one who has grown into his rightful role of a powerful (if flawed) heroic figure traveling the universe on his own terms to bring his knowledge, intelligence, and practical outlook to where they're needed.

I'd say he didn't need Clara in order to function after Deep Breath, and he doesn't need her now to help him see himself (and, sometimes, others and their needs).  He does need her, as all the  Doctors tend to do, to share his adventures, helping to give them depth and meaning by witnessing and participating in them, at the Doctor's side.

However I had to respond since schools can do a hell of a lot more than just say ""Don't eat so much that you regularly consume a calorie surplus, and avoid sugars.""

They can teach about food and how much sugar really exists in certain things, like soft drinks or premade sandwhiches you get from certain fast food sandwhich places. It can teach about cookery and making food from fresh veg or even how sugar is classified as a poison. 

Hell you can show pictures of arteries clogged with fat, pictures of what someone who lost a leg to diabetus looks like. there is a hell of a lot more that schools can do than just a one word sentance. And there's a hell of lot more parents could do but parents seem to be as misinformed as their kids. 

and your right it's a social cultural change that;s needed. you know how your not going to get it. by conflicting messages. It's no good saying ""this is bad"" and then having an advert on tv saying ""but look how popular you will be if you have it.""

Fuck the consequences! The plebs will pay for it, like they always have! Neoliberalism is fine for those that can afford it, the rest have to borrow beyond their means. The rise of the neoliberals is as much to do with the expansion of big business (including media empires) as it is with ""prosperity for all"". Take a look around you and see just who has become prosperous. I certainly haven't.

&gt;The public should not expect to see a police officer after crimes such as burglary, the head of the new National Police Chiefs' Council has said.
Sara Thornton told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire budget cuts and the changing nature of criminality meant police in England and Wales had to prioritise.
She said it ""could be"" that if an iPad was stolen from a home an officer would not come round to investigate.
There had to be a ""conversation with the public"" over priorities, she added.
Ms Thornton has said that forces need radical reform if they are to survive budget cuts.

But in all seriousness, we are a bit different here at Palace. Not better, necessarily - despite what our dear OP implies! - just we have a slightly different outlook. Palace is a family club, with strong ties to its local area. We love seeing local boys come through the ranks and grow to be footballers at Palace, and I think there's a higher priority for that kind of connection in this club. It's unlikely that anyone who isn't from the area will ever quite be able to feel the same connection to the club that people who grew up where the streets run red and blue have from birth, but that's okay. Understand that this isn't a club where airs and graces are particularly encouraged, and that we have some rather unique elements - such as our main rivals living miles away, our strange history, and, yes, our pets - and everyone welcomes you with open arms. Innit.

Basically we're a bit contrarian, quite grounded, have some funny quirks, an odd history, a love of local players and above all else a hell of a lot of fatalism.

null,null,roobens,null,null,null,"This seems an odd argument to me. Sure you can say that the shift between two models is subtle, but compare the difference between the original iPhone and the latest model and it's huge. Now step back and compare smartphones in general to the mobiles we toted 10-15 years ago. You don't just make huge steps like that in a short period of time; the technology develops at a rate governed by the research and development put into it, and that's only made possible by pouring money and resources into it. Money and resources that are generated by selling products as each small technological development ripens. 

As to iPads, or tablets in general, they're far more an offshoot of the smartphone than the other way around, and so are just another rung on the ladder of the incremental technological advances that you're denigrating when you say the iPhone 6 is only mildly better than the iPhone 5. So it's not really disingenuous to talk about how the iPad might provide someone with a tangible increase in quality of life in a discussion about iPhones. 

Of course your overarching point about these increases in quality of life for rich westerners versus the way in which it affects the developing world is a totally different kettle of fish, and I'd tend to agree with you there, but if we're strictly talking about the economic and social benefits of incremental technological advances within the markets in which they're consumed, I wouldn't say it's a false economy at all.

The same exact thing goes for getting business done early. How many transfer windows do we need to have in the premier league to understand that getting business done early, aka before pre-season or at the very least before the season starts, is so obviously advantageous to having a better season it's frightening? 

Just because this is the way things have been DOES NOT MAKE IT ACCEPTABLE!

Stop supporting our great club with kid gloves. Expect the best from them like we have since 1878 and when you don't get the best, or anywhere near it, understand that those of us who remember - and have had the stories passed down from our fathers, grand-fathers, and great-grand-fathers before us - about Dixie Dean, the Holy Trinity, School of Science, winning FA Cups, European Cups, and league titles will do it for you.

This does not mean that free bunnies should be a manifesto commitment, or that its inclusion does not send other signals to the public about Labour's direction and ethos.

Likewise rail nationalisation. People like the idea of rail reform, cuz the trains are shit. They may prefer nationalisation when presented on its own as a result. But it's not the kind of thing which will win an election, and it whilst it might be a tactical win it's probably a strategic error.

I don't believe this has ever been true.  If you look at the Industrial Revolution, productivity increased greatly as new technologies were introduced.  But this did not cause the average worker to gain more free time.  The same is true of today.  I still remember when we were promised that personal computers would revolutionise the workplace, allowing us all to have more free time.  The contrary has happened; as many tasks have become easier due to computers, we have had to increase our productivity whilst spending more time working.  

Mobile phones (and email) are another example.  Before they become so ubiquitous, people could generally keep their work and private lives separate.  Now, if you own a mobile, you can be called up by your boss at any time to come in and do some urgent work, or to cover for someone else, or to go to a meeting, etc.  

In short, newer technologies in the workplace generally seem to mean we have to work harder to be more productive.

null,null,Hemmers,null,null,null,"Well, four out of the [Five Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes) are Commonwealth nations (and the fifth is a colony who ""opted-out""!). Yes, we have a lot in common and work together.

There are very tight political links beyond simply the fact that we share a head of state, and one of the key reasons is that when the Brits went abroad we carried our *culture* with us. There's a reason why the big countries in Rugby and Cricket are Commonwealth nations and that's because we took our sports and pastimes there big style. It's spread organically into other countries, but the Commonwealth have them at their heart. The Indians don't go in for Rugby so much, but love their cricket and also have some blinding target shooters (which is another export - every July rifle teams from NZ, Australia, Canada, South Africa and the US descend on Bisley Camp in Surrey for the Imperial Meeting). Canada are different again with Ice Hockey/Snow Sports (which SA/Aus/NZ/India don't have as much of!) and CFL, but they do maintain a certain British reserve compared with their louder American neighbours.

Culturally, Australia and NZ have far more in common with the UK and Canada for instance than they do with Indonesia, or than the UK has with Greece or Italy. We are on a level nationally where we share banter and gentle-ribbing that we don't share with other developed countries like Japan for instance. There's a common culture and understanding there that fosters co-operation.

Brits have a lot in common with their Commonwealth counterparts (well, the white ones at least), because their counterparts by and large *are* Brits (if they go back far enough). I have cousins in Canada, and have visited the grave of the Welshman who went out to start a new life and spawned that side of our family (and I descend from the brothers who stayed in the UK). Much common heritage, culturally, in sport, politically and for many people on a personal/ancestral level as well. It also accounts for why we have closer relations with the whiter Commonwealth nations, and less so with the African nations - we've just got more in common - personal ties, extended family, etc.

As far as Africa goes, with the exception of South Africa, we're a lot more distant. We have a working diplomatic relationship with those nations, perhaps closer than we do with non-Commonwealth African nations, but it's much more of a soft-touch relationship rather than the tight political and military partnerships we enjoy with the more developed Commonwealth nations.",null,0,null,1439419443,null,null,1439463955,0,cu0xxni,null,t3_3grvpo,null,null,null,t3_3grvpo,null,null,null,1440444278,null,12,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12,null

What a Russell Group university gets you is the prestige associated with the name, which sounds awful but can genuinely make a difference to employment prospects. A non-vocational degree from, say, Bath will in most cases look more impressive than one from Bath Spa even if the actual teaching was better at the latter. It would also make a big difference at postgraduate level, where research takes a more central role.

Edit: just to provide a counterexample, I have done biology-related degrees at two different Russell Group universities and found the teaching was pretty great at both.

UK:

- Up to £10,600 - 0%

- £10,600 to £41,785 - 20%

- £41,785 to £160,000 - 40%

- £160,000+ - 45%

[France](http://www.french-property.com/guides/france/finance-taxation/taxation/calculation-tax-liability/rates/):

- Up to £4,300 - 0%

- £4,300 to £8,500 - 5.5%

- £8,500 to £19,000 - 14%

- £19,000 to £51,000 - 30%

- £51,000 to £108,000 - 41%

- £108,000+ - 45%

In other words, French people hand over much more in tax. You're paying income tax much earlier in your income, you're on a 30% rate on earnings above £19,000 while in the UK you're still on 20% there, and while on the UK you'll hit 40% before you do in France, the French 45% band kicks in far earlier than the UK's, and there's bands at 48% and 52% in France for £178,000+ and £357,000+ which don't exist in the UK at all.

Corbyn wants to spend like a socialist country but doesn't have the balls to tell people he's going to tax them like one, too. Instead he talks it off with mythical tax clampdowns that apparently *no one else has ever thought to try*.

I was using myfitnesspal for a while and it's pretty good, but it's a lot of effort if you eat complicated meals and cook everything from scratch (which I do).

To be honest, in a way I kind of miss the days where I was just trying to lose weight. When you're losing weight all exercise is good, and food is basically good as long as you eat less of it. When you're trying to grow but keep your bodyfat percentage low, you have to eat loads, but it all has to be healthy, you have to try to get ridiculous amounts of protein into you, it forces you to change your whole diet and view on food.",null,0,null,1439420007,null,null,false,0,cu0y9nx,null,t3_3gp7xn,null,null,null,t3_3gp7xn,null,null,null,1440444436,null,1,null,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1,null

Now Cons are pushing futher right, and labour is pushing futher left. They are annihilating the old ""cons light"" approach, but that might not be a bad thing.

Public opinion has changed, big business (among various other things) caused the worst financial crash in 100 years, now things Thatcher never touched (privitising the NHS - majorly) are coming about etc, its reactionary for labour to push left, to work with public op and start getting the general pop on side, being the counter to the new ever unpopular policies. 

They see the SNP take almost every seat across scotland. People want change, the labour party have to change to ever win, the same way Tony Blair changed labour in the 90's. The situation in the 90's and 2000's are different than now.

As to your last comment, I think that's a bit funny seeing as Labour's left wing was effectively kicked out to create New Labour. Maybe Tony and Gordon should have created a new party? Of course not, it's a waste of time in our two-party FPTP system, so it's a moot point and of course any actual political movement will come from within the two main parties. Although I find the idea of people being bothered by Labour putting forward left wing ideas a bit rich.

What makes the SNP different as a minority coalition partner to, say, the Lib Dems, is that they have a clear way of demanding things that will specifically benefit only their voters (i.e. they can demand money for the Scottish parliament) without fear of electoral repercussions (because they don't stand for parliament outside Scotland).

Perhaps I'm being unfair, I don't tend to see many issues with the very basic care homes that have relatively uncomplicated residents that just like to sit and drink tea.  It's when they start trying to deal with often very complicated cases, psychiatric, dementia etc. that things seem to fall apart somewhat.  It's sometimes hard to find the nurses etc. who can provide valuable information because they're presumably few in number and dealing with an entire building

It's all too common to get called out to some very vaguely described incident, get there to find nobody really knows who or what the call is about and struggle to track down the one person who is supposed to know but invariably will really have no idea of the patients history - there seems to be a perpetual shift change that destroys all knowledge of the patients in some places.  I try and suggest a sensible policy upon calling for an ambulance would be to retrieve the patients notes so they're ready for the arriving crew but I'm yet to see it.

I've seen a worrying lack of basic life support competency too, I mean I don't expect much more than the very basics of giving someone a fighting chance but I've found some troubling stuff in only a couple of years service.  In a place where you can reasonably expect there to be a lot of strokes, heart attacks, cardiac arrests etc. it doesn't seem like they're all really clued up on how best to manage them before we arrive.  Many places seem to have a policy of only calling 999 very rarely and instead leave all incidents to the GP who visits during the day.  I've had a few ?stroke jobs that were beyond any real help because of this, or perhaps nobody noticed the symptoms at the time...

Oh and DNACPR notices incorrectly filled in (doctors issue but care home should be checking these!) or missing &amp; presumably lost in a filing cabinet somewhere but they assure me it exists!

Everything is worse overnight because of ridiculously short staffing, it's often a challenge to even get through the front door at night because there's no staff free to let us in.

It can teach about cookery and making food from fresh veg or even how sugar is classified as a poison. 

Yeah schools *can* try to teach all that, but in a system where 40% of children leave school at 16 effectively illiterate and innumerate, what hope do you think doing a few token wordsearches or crosswords about healthy eating is going to instill in them? You can't just keep cramming the national curriculum with more and more stuff to plaster over the missing parts of our society.

&gt;It's no good saying ""this is bad"" and then having an advert on tv saying ""but look how popular you will be if you have it."" 

Which product are you referring to here?

&gt;and you want to make gluttony socially unnaceptable. great how are you going to do that? by shaming? by cutting off medical care becouse its self inflicted? by having a campaign to stop all poeple of a certain BMI no longer allowed in certain stores? or are you going to do it by....education?

Wow, that's a colossal chip you have on your shoulder. There's a myriad of ways public obesity can be resolved, none of which feed your apparent victim complex that everyone is out to get you.

Straight of the bat we could tax sugars and sugar-alcohols. Coca-cola (with sugar) should be effectively unmarketable as a convenience soft drink. Sure consumption taxes more drastically impact the less well-off, but then they're the ones with the soaring morbid obesity so it goes hand-in-hand.

Next up is enhancing the current nutritional information labeling of food and drink. The red/yellow/green system is a good start, but needs to be improved. kCalorie per portion needs to be the biggest thing on the packaging (bigger even than the branding).

After that, ban targeted advertising **and** marketing of **any** foodstuff to children apart from unprocessed base ingredients (i.e. uncooked carrots, water, fish, eggs, etc.).

Longer term, require local authorities to build 100% segregated cycle paths to-and-around schools. Once those are mostly in place, ban any parking near or in schools.

Of course, those are just societal things to affect a change in culture. It's the individual who has to remain healthy, and the melancholy absolvement of responsibility so common with the obese today is quite simply a demonstration of weak character and will.",null,0,null,1439420643,null,null,1439420922,0,cu0yn06,null,t3_3gpvui,null,null,null,t1_cu0wa1i,null,null,null,1440444611,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Some players come good moving from lesser teams to bigger teams (Shearer, Rooney, Anderton etc.) But, in those cases it was clear for all to see that these were quality players.

Bent was never anything but a sub for us. Jol didn't want him, and all he could muster at the press-conference announcing the transfer was ""He runs a lot"". Redknapp wasn't more enthused either, at one point making the case his missus was a better finisher than Bent.

Dempsey scored 17 goals in 2011-12. Came to us, scored 7 goals. Was shipped out to the MLS the following season...not exactly a good progression in your career, now is it?

Ever since I had a post mentioning LB spirited away I've been a tad suspicious of what the mods are up to.

No I don't think Tom Hanks is watching.

Whilst I admit I was gullible in believing the original post this morning was really banned in the UK and subsequently being made to look the fool I clearly am, I still felt that the business about our senior police lying repeatedly in court had some bearing on the more recent cases concerning the Ewe Tree investigation and the Dolphin Square accusations.

Sadly, as Keith Allen made the film and the Grauniad outright condemned it, it seems to have fallen by the wayside.

The proposition that Prince Philip was or is a philanderer was new to me and I had to concede, was one that I had never ever seen even hinted at in the press. As is the suggestion that he is a psychopathic Nazi.

The white Uno was something I hadn't recalled considering and as so many others appear  guilty of I had not considered the fuller ramifications of the verdict.

I am not a royalist and had no undying love for the departed princess.

It was the establishment crookery that piqued my interest and forgive me if I'm wrong but I felt in light of what is slowly trickling out about major political figures of the past, the reported machinations of the establishment in this case might warrant consideration or discussion.

null,null,tusksrus,,Blairite | Join us on IRC! See the sidebar for details.,null,"&gt; For this reason, I don't see any problem with Corbyn being Labour leader, as I just don't see a Labour win in five years anyway. 

You realize that there's a scale here, though - some losses are worse than others. I don't think the other three are overwhelmingly likely to beat Theresa May in 2020 either, but they're not as divisive, they won't tear the party apart, they'll bring it closer to an electable state, and they won't completely vacate the centre ground. The same can't be said for Corbyn - he's the most disastrous candidate. By far.

The Tories have a very slim majority - set to increase with the planned boundary reforms. Why do we have to give them even more ground? Why do we have to lose MPs and not gain, simply because there isn't a candidate which you believe today will win an election in five years time? I'd choose modest gains that fall short of a majority over a collapse of the entire party! Wouldn't you?

If Labour vacates the centre ground in this parliament, the Tories can move it to the right. They've been more centrist than they've wanted to be for too long - anchored by the broadly centrist Miliband and their coalition partners. With the Lib Dems and Labour in total disarray (because if we elect Corbyn, the Lib Dems are fucked under Farron too), there's no reason for the Tories to not push rightwards.

10x GCSE (A* - C), 4x A-Level (A-C) from a reputable grammar school in the area.

2.1 Degree from a four-year Uni course in French &amp; Media/Cultural Studies, including a year studying abroad. I should've picked a more reputable Uni when making the choice, rather than one I knew I'd easily make the entrance criteria for.

Finished Uni, and was regularly down to the last two or three interviewees for graduate training programmes in marketing, often from hundreds of applicants. Didn't get the break I needed to be the one picked over the other candidate- the positions were highly competitive, whereas I quickly learned translation is even moreso.

So, I was unemployed for six months after finishing Uni, and couldn't even get an ordinary minimum wage job due to being either overqualified or more expensive than a younger worker. Finally got a minimum wage restaurant job at a new tourist attraction, and worked there for eight years in numerous roles, including management for nine months in the middle. Twice left that company to try and further my career (it's independent, so opportunity for progression is very limited), but didn't take to either of those positions.

Finally left once and for all before Christmas last year, to another minimum wage job (receptionist), albeit to an established nationwide chain with much better prospects and opportunity for progression. Feel like this might finally be the company I've been looking for, but the fact remains that I could've got this same job at age 16 without any qualifications, rather than doing so at 31.",null,0,null,1439423933,null,null,false,0,cu10in4,null,t3_3gqqea,null,null,null,t3_3gqqea,null,null,null,1440445503,null,3,null,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

Could we do better than him?  Of course, but we could also do a lot lot worse so ease off him a bit.

Also we don't know what goes into making a transfer happen so we don't know why we aren't signing players. Maybe we're just looking for a better fit and this stuff takes time.

But there seems this entire mass of people that seem to think New Labour did nothing good at all while in power for 13 years. 

I just cannot believe that people have not clocked it yet. This site, social media, the people you talk to, are a ""massive"" echo chamber for the anti-Tory, anti-Blair, anti-austerity etc opinion. BUT - THEY ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE IN ANY WAY OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC!!!!

Remember how no one here thought the Tories would get a majority before the exit poll on May 7th? And the Labour party under Ed wasn't left wing enough? Even though the union bloc vote against David is what got him elected?

How the hell is Corbyn going to improve the result compared to what Ed did? His policies are gunning for 1.1M Green voters and 1.4M SNP voters in Scotland and a handful of Plaid/Trade Union voters and potentially some of the ~25% of people who didn't vote (and if you genuinely think all 25% of those people who didn't vote are Socialists, hell, even 5%, then think again).

There was an argument that Ed was a better choice than David as he was a clean break with the Blair years, the wars, etc. Well that clean break lost them 26 seats while they were not even in government. But no, that clearly wasn't enough! Secretly all these millions of people who switch from Labour to UKIP or Tory must want in Corbyn! That will surely bring the masses back! The General Election in England was won by the Tory party as they convinced enough people that they couldn't dare vote Labour or you'd end up with the left wing Scottish Nationalists running the show. So rather than listen to what the electorate said the Labour party ""supporters"" (£3 to ruin a party you've never helped? Fuck off, the cut off for registering should have been when the candidate list was announced, shocking entryism) are deciding that clearly they know best and they don't just want people in England to have the chance of the SNP and their left wing policies in place via a coalition, they want to be able to vote for them in England directly!

I am not able to vote in this contest as I am not a member or supporter of the Labour party but these nutters have got to come to their senses and go and knock on some doors of people they don't usually interact with and maybe try listening to some things that maybe they don't like hearing. That maybe the majority of people don't hate their job and would like to get on with their lives in a country that isn't in deficit and is growing economically (as it is now). Thousands of Tory councillors were surveyed asking who they would most and least like to win; Most - Corbyn, Least - Kendall. Voters in key constituencies Labour lost this election were polled, they'd never vote Labour again under Corbyn. The Labour membership were polled, people who have been members the longest least want Corbyn!

But here we now are, with a bunch of people who cannot for one second contemplate listening to the MAJORITY of people who don't agree with them just because those people aren't on reddit/twitter/facebook and they're about to push the self destruct button.

They'd rather vote him in, do nothing and then lose idealistically under Corbyn than dare to contemplate co-operation, listening, hardwork and compromise with the vast majority of people who don't share their views for a shot at getting Labour into power. Every day on betting sites as Corbyn's odds of becoming Labour leader have gotten shorter the odds of a Labour majority next election have gotten larger.

As I said earlier, I'm not a member of the Labour party. Yet Corbyn was in Bristol not far from me so I went and listened and what I heard was utter drivel. This is not a man who is a good public speaker, this is not a man who is good at answering difficult questions, this is not a man who is looking to compromise on anything at all and, like the Tories and the SNP, this is not a man who wants voting reform any time soon.

If, as it seems is now inevitable, all these new members decide to doom this party to nothing more than a protest party on the sidelines then please do spare a thought before doing so. Spare a thought for the thousands of members who have been members for years, not days, who don't want to see the party they have worked so hard for destroyed. Spare a thought for those people who aren't politically engaged or active on social media who are hard up and would benefit from having a Labour government in power. Because if Corbyn gets in then you will never help those people and just like all the smug cunts who vote Green and then complain when the Tories win you actually have no one to blame but yourself.

To go back to the start do not forget that Labour actually did a lot of good in the 13 years it was in power. Being in power isn't easy, nor is every decision that is made perfect. But if people don't actually think that for 3 elections New Labour helped support some of the most vulnerable people in society while still appealing to the middle ground then there really is no hope.",null,0,null,1439424279,null,null,1439424892,0,cu10plm,null,t3_3gqxtq,null,null,null,t1_cu0mcva,null,null,null,1440445594,null,48,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,48,null

The person gets sent back to 5000bc. He is considered a god by the more primitive people and they would praise him for 5 years until someone stabs him in the back. If an angel touched him as soon as he got zapped back to 5000bc, it would get those 5 years worth.

I don't see why touching a person multiple times would share or diminish that energy, the angels live off the potential life that person could have lived - be it now or 200 years ago. Once a person is sent back in time, his present existence is terminated and he has a new potential life in that time period free for angels to take.

You're right, I don't know the ins and outs of transfer mechanics. What I do know is that every promoted club, every club in the premier league, and some clubs in lower divisions have now spent more money than us this summer. That is unacceptable. I don't know how this isn't making sense to people. You get left behind if you stand still. 

There is now more money in the premier league through tv money than ever before. Not to mention we've been in the PL every year of it's existence and so have received about as much tv money as anyone bar Utd, Arsenal, and Liverpool.

You're correct that he's steadied the ship and for that he'll be warmly remembered, at least for the first 5-8 years he's been owner. But he has held on too long now, presided over two, verging on three, failed stadium moves, a failed stadium redevelopment, and every major asset stripped from club ownership. That is UNACCEPTABLE.

The more we're called crazies for daring to want the Labour party to represent us a bit more, the more entrenched we're likely to feel, I'm afraid, because it's largely our prior disenfranchisement that is driving us to vote. I'm not afraid of compromise, and nor are most of my peers. I don't think Tony Blair is evil incarnate, nor do I hate everything New Labour did. I'm a person just like the rest signing up, likely with contradictory and complex views on the world, as nuanced as your own. But it is interesting that for you, after decades of political consensus in which New Labour was born as a compromise toward the neoliberal consumerist era, now the youth and the socialists and union members are asking for a compromise away from the entrenchment of enrichment for the already wealthy -  that's asking too much. It's all because we live in a bubble, the source of our frustration, apparently.

null,null,observeroftheworld,null,null,null,"Whoever did the inviting should expect to pay for the meal.  However, if there is a second date, the bill should be split.  There are conditions on this general rule: if one party is far less financially endowed than the other, the richer one should expect to more heavily subsidize the bill on subsequent dates.  This is the price you pay if you like the other person, want to keep going out and want to go to venues that cost money.

 It is touchy and varies from person to person.  For example, when I was a poor student and an employed guy asked me out, I would give my budget range upfront and if he agreed,  we would split 50-50. If he proposed an expensive venue, I would say no, and propose another, cheaper option. Then,  if he disagreed, I would advise that I would not be able to go with him. It was his choice to pay all or most of the bill, or opt for a cheaper option, or we cooked a meal at one of our apartments.  Years later, when I was gainfully employed and making much more income than someone I wished to spend time with, I would work the process in the reverse. 

Two date killer lines proposed by others were that: (1) if you pay for the first date, after you pay the bill,  you state that the other person has to pay for the next date.  This is very insulting to the recipient. It intimates that you are both a skin flint and lack class. A second date may not be in your future. (2) if you invite someone on a date and then tell them when you meet up or are at the table that the bill should be split, you are again being very presumptuous and insulting.  In short, just assume that the inviter pays, that subsequent dates will be split in some way, and if the invitee is not impoverished and never offers to pay any portion of the bill, you have to decide if you wish to extend an invitation again. If you do not, the onus is on the other person to do the inviting. 

Finally, a comment was made about women being required to pay equally for a date since women expect to be treated equal to men.  In a perfect world, this would be true.  But women earn about 70% of men's average income so there are indeed income inequalities between the genders.

Then my home life took a turn for the worse; dad died just towards the very end of my A-levels, mum took it badly and became mentally ill over the course of that year and killed herself a year later. On top of all that I was gay and closeted and never had much time when it felt appropriate to address it.  
 
  In spite of those distractions, which all but consumed me at times, I managed a high 2:2. But, I never really planned beyond that. I was never thinking about what I wanted from life, just treating the degree as something to occupy my thoughts. And at the time I graduated it seemed (accurately or not) like there was a huge gulf in quality of options between 2:1 and 2:2 degrees, and I just didn't have much fight or conviction in me to push with what I saw as a handicap.    

  Then I got temp work in a bank for about a year, kept thinking about post-grad or other options but never felt confident and frequently applied for somethings and then bottled it at the last minute. I left my temp job to go on a Masters course that I then backed out of, leaving me jobless. Eventually ended up working part-time in a coffee shop, but became increasingly depressed until I was struggling to face going outside, eventually had to leave that job. 'Came out' about that time, which has been exciting but still something I struggle to feel comfortable about. Right now I'm seeing a shrink trying to get fit for work, but I don't think I'll ever have anything like the kind of career I assumed I'd get as a high-achieving student. Seems like a cruel twist of fate.  

  So I think partly it was the external crap happening, and partly it was me being inherently quite timid and not comfortable in my skin.
