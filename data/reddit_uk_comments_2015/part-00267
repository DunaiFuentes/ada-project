For example the BBC Natural History Unit has consistently produced landmark documentaries that are critically acclaimed. They push the boundaries of what is technically possible in order to bring the highest quality images of our world to the screen. These programmes have intrinsic value but may never get made if they had to answer to a subscriber base.

The [Child of Our Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_of_Our_Time) series is another example. A 20 year social experiment that would surely never be made without public funding.

Then look at the myriad of services available for educators, just recently the BBC has introduced its own microcomputer for school children. This will help them learn programming and other skills that are so useful in today's society. They provide services to learn new languages, to learn how to cook, and a wealth of scientific information. All of these things to all ages.

The World Service has also provided free news to people around the world in a vast array of languages, often transcending national censorship. The more cynical may also call it our greatest tool of soft power. Sherlock, Top Gear (RIP), Doctor Who, and more all put British media on the global stage.
You may not feel the BBC is vital, but it is as core of a British institution as the NHS and we would be foolish and short sighted to destroy it by removing the license fee. You just have to look at the media in the US to see what a purely corporate model leads to.

Sorry to rant, but with the way public institutions are going in the UK this is something I think is worth defending ferociously.

Maybe I'm misreading but isn't this just the officer disputing Mr Wilson's claim that he's being respectful? 

People tend to make sarcastic comments to the last thing someone says, not something said 2 sentences ago (ie the officer isn't talking about the 'I haven't committed disorder' part, he's talking about Mr Wilson's claim he was being polite and respectful). Yes it's unprofessional and the officer sounds like an arsehole and the reason for arresting him in the first place is rubbish but I'm not sure why the article has interpreted this quote as him falsifying a report.

No, if I were telling you that I would have used words along those lines. I'm telling you that you should listen to women about their experiences. All women, not just the staff. 

I have seen women surrounded on a noisy, energetic and busy dance floor. I have seen women groped by men and seperated from their friends by groups of men, all on dance floors and at raves. It's not done overtly, it's not groups laughing and not quite realising the effect they're having as you might imagine the stupid women in the original article doing.

That to me is fundamentally unfair.

If you're born here its a totally different scenario. Firstly i'd like to make it clear im a third generation immigrant, my family moved here from Malaysia in the 1960s. Secondly, this isnt about 'being British', everyone thats here already gets the same treatment, the problem is we're overcrowded in a time of shortage, economic adjustment and other social problems. To you over 300,000 a year and climbing may sound manageable, to most people and to every political party and politician and administrator, *including* Labour, its not manageable at all, and there is widespread public opposition to it. Although the principle of letting everyone come in sounds nice, its almost utopian, and unfortunately the reality is pretty grim. The longer we let it sit and deny it, the more and more the right-wing and the far-right will build and build, until you get a Sweden or France-style situation where parties like Front National and the Sweden Democrats wield scary amounts of influence preaching policies like 'hire white people first' and 'support Putin'.",null,0,null,1436819600,null,0,false,0,ct24680,null,t3_3d46j9,null,t1_ct24680,null,t1_ct21r7b,null,null,null,1437827010,null,0,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,0,null

Most people in Britain don't know this because the majority of Chinese people in the UK are cantonese. 

Less than 5% of Chinese people actually speak Cantonese while 70% speak mandarin, 6.5% speak Wu (Shanghainese), 6% speak Min (language spoken in taiwan and fujian province), etc.

If you learn Cantonese, sure you can speak to your local takeaway owners (which is kind of pointless because they can already speak English), but that's about it. On the other hand, Mandarin is used as a lingua franca between the different Chinese dialect groups in China and you can use it all over China. The only major place where Cantonese is in official use is in Hong Kong, a city smaller than London. 

It's like telling a student going to the US to learn Spanish instead of English because Spanish is used frequently in certain parts of California.

But the real work was done in the branches to marginalise them. Their MO was to join a branch en masse (big groups of friends). they usually had no jobs so their subscriptions were very low and they had plenty of time. And they'd try to pack meetings and try to set agendas and get their group voted into the local EC. 

Your normal branch member then grimly raced home after work, rushed to the meetings and tried to outvote them. It was tiring because you couldn't miss a single meeting in case you lost control of your branch. It was really a war of attrition which went on for years till we wore them out. Some militant people walked out when Blair became leader, but you still have them in some places.

EDIT: 89 PL appearances, sorry, forgot to include sub appearances. So 49 in 101 in all comps. Still.

EDIT 2: Lukaku, amazingly enough, also has 42 PL goals in 82 Premier League starts (but 112 PL appearances overall with subs included) for Chelsea, West Brom and Everton. 53 goals in 131 overall English club appearances in all comps. Everton bought him for £28m last summer. £32.5m for Benteke a year later, with a shedload of TV money coming into the equation in a year or two, is surely equivalent to the £28m they paid for Lukaku last year. And Benteke has scored as many PL goals in fewer overall matches.

£32.5m is a fair price these days. Like it or not, that's just how it is for domestic transfers in the Prem these days.",null,0,null,1436820574,null,0,1436821541,0,ct24uhr,null,t3_3d5vle,null,t1_ct24uhr,null,t1_ct24kh1,null,null,null,1437827476,null,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14,null

To be fair, I genuinely can't recall seeing him play, but he was signed for Cardiff for £1 million when they were in the Premiership and seemingly got frozen out after Solskjaer was sacked, although considering that Cardiff were happy to get rid of McCormack and both their manager and owner's decision-making is very questionable, I think it's all rather promising. The best part is - and I've no idea how we pulled it off - we've got him on a season-long loan with the view to take him permanently on a three-year deal. So that should eliminate the chance of us grumbling later about more deadwood clogging up the side.

Also encouraging is that this is clearly an Uwe Rosler signing - he's worked with him before and wants to bring him in again. And he also fills in what we're missing in midfield with Rudy gone: a big, physical presence in the middle of the pitch with a good engine for all the pressing and transitions from attacking and defending that Rosler likes. Cook, Mowatt, Sloth, Bianchi, they're all talented in different areas but none of them are really capable of challenging for headers against your standard Championship player.

---

&gt;__*The Russell Brand Show* hoax (aka ""prank"") telephone calls row__, sometimes referred to as ""__Sachsgate__"", followed a series of voice messages left by comedian [Russell Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brand) and TV presenter [Jonathan Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ross) on the answering machine of actor [Andrew Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sachs). It followed a [BBC Radio 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_2) decision to allow an episode of *[The Russell Brand Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Russell_Brand_Show_(radio_show\))*, recorded earlier in the week due to Brand's other work commitments, to be broadcast on Saturday 18 October 2008. On the episode, Brand and Ross called Sachs as a guest to interview on-air; when Sachs failed to answer the telephone, they are heard leaving a series of lewd messages on his answering machine, including comments about Brand's relationship with Sachs's granddaughter, Georgina Baillie—at the time a performer with the group Satanic Sluts.

2. You can buy a home ticket (although you will need to be a Jack Army member to be sure of being able to purchase one, this costs 25 GBP and give you the chance to buy match tickets before they go on general sale and I imagine you'll need to do so to watch Swans - Liverpool.

null,false,aenor,null,null,null,"Oh gawd, the Foot saga.

Michael Foot was a lovely, lovely man, a patriot and someone who criticised Nazis in the 1930's before it was fashionable (and before Churchill did).  (Unlike that idiot Corbyn, Michael Foot supported the Falklands war and the right of the Falklanders to remain British if they wanted. He did not like the Facsist Junta running Argentina at all, they were killing socialists and anyone who got in their way - which is why it is so shameful Corbyn takes the stance he does. Indeed when the Argentinians took the lslands, Foot lambasted Thatcher so hard for withdrawing the South Atlantic Naval Patrol, which allowed the Argies to sneak in, that Thatcher left the chamber shaking and saying, ""My govt is on the line, I've got to get the islands back"").

At that time of his leadership election, the left of the party was dominated by Benn (who was *not* a Militant despite his many flaws), and left-wingers knew Benn wouldn't win and persuaded Foot to stand to defeat Denis Healey. There were growing numbers of Militant infiltrating the party during that period, but there was also a group to the *right* of Healey, the infamous gang of four, who decided that even if Healey won, they wanted out. So they plotted to set up their own party and then do a poison pill vote for Foot to scupper Lab with an academic style man who was unsuited to leadership. Foot duly won (voted in by *two* of Labour's enemies, Militant + SDP traitors), they departed to form the SDP and took hundreds of people with them and dozens of MPs.

With that wing of the party gone, Lab suddenly became lopsided. When the manifesto was written, the fed-up people in charge of writing it simply put in *every single suggestion* made to them - the idea was, we're going to lose, so let's put this crap in, so that the voters reject it and we can demonstrate to the left that this stuff is mad. However, I would say the bit about wanting to leave the EEC in that manifesto was pure Foot - he campaigned against joining in 1973 and thought it was a capitalist plot.

Fun fact 1: It was Michael Foot who got Tony Blair his seat in Parliament. He met him, was taken with how normal he seemed compared to all the Militant/Tatchell types swilling around and phoned Sedgefield. It was a new constituency, and the selection for it happened *after* the 1983 election was called. he was added to the shortlist and he won the seat. He was the very last selection in that election. And that was one of the few seats Lab won.

Fun Fact 2: Polly Toynbee was SDP. She stood for election in 1983 for Lewisham East. She got 22% of teh vote, which was enough to topple the Labour MP and let the Conservative sneak through the middle and win it. When I read her chuntering in the Guardian in 2010 about supporting the LibDems and a Lib-Lab coalition, my heart sank. And of course history repeated itself, the splitting of votes to the LibDems in 2010 let the Conservatives in.",null,0,null,1436822254,null,0,1436822894,0,ct25ygl,null,t3_3d5w21,null,t1_ct25ygl,null,t1_ct24cm5,null,null,null,1437828284,null,13,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,13,null

Look the main problem is so far and what it looks like our ""marquee"" signing is going to be for £4m and the manger only wants to add 2 more players to a team that finished 11th. Are we aiming for Europe or just mid table again?? We've a good 11 no doubt but the depth for the most part is bad. Why would a player like Rom or Kev try their hardest week in week out when they know their places are cemented in the team because of poor backup options.

[Link](http://cdn.builtlean.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/body-fat-percentage-men.jpg) Maybe you need to go lower for the results you want, but I know enough people with 10+% and a decent six pack. You'd go lower for competition, but if you just want to look fit and are just working out as a hobby rather than competing, 10% will do for most people. 

&gt; As for 15% being underweight, no! That's pretty much a healthy BF for any man. I've been lifting for 15 years, I'm well aware of what BF percentage is healthy. And if you are training as an athlete you maintain 15%ish to obtain optimal performance, you cut before a competition.

For a man, yes. For a woman, no. 15% Is where for a lot of women menstruation stops and other negatives kick in. I was talking mainly from a woman's point of view, maybe I should have clarified that. I am underweight at 15%. It is really hard to get there for an overweight woman who doesn't work out unless she's overdoing the diet to the point where it becomes problematic and worst case scenario, anorexia. However, I do think that most men who come from being overweight and are just dieting to get healthy wouldn't go below 15%. Keep in mind not all people are into fitness and working out like us. Most of them are happy to be just normal or thinner and don't care about being toned or muscular even. This is not something to worry about when it comes to weight loss groups. When it comes to helping anorexic people gain weight it is more important, but in this specific case it's safe to say BF isn't something to worry or even think about at all. We're not talking about athletes or extremely fit people, remember. 

&gt; The more BF you have, the easier it is to burn calories, so it is related.

If we're talking about calories burnt during exercise, yes, there is a difference, but I wouldn't say it is BF related per se. I was talking about weight loss trough calorie management only. Amount of BF won't make a difference when the person isn't in motion. The reason people with higher BF often burn more during a run or a walk is because they may be less fit so their body is less efficient at managing the energy. The fitter person will burn less calories during that same run. However, if a person with higher BF is fitter than a skinny fat person with lower BF, the person with lower BF will burn calories more easily. This is a very individual thing and not something weight loss groups would really look at as it would be too hard to monitor everyone in great detail.

When we're talking about athletic people or fitness, this is a different thing entirely. We may want to manage BF and make sure everything is safe and look in more detail at calories burnt. But for weight loss groups, which is what is being discussed here, BF doesn't really matter all that much. Weight is what is being looked at rather than BF, and most weight loss groups will assume their members are sedentary or lightly active at most. They will apply the basic calories in VS calories out.",null,0,null,1436824163,null,0,false,0,ct276r3,null,t3_3d20y7,null,t1_ct276r3,null,t1_ct23gyx,null,null,null,1437829168,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

This is so true and something I hadn't thought of. He's big, intimidating and strong as hell.

Either one could drag two defenders away and that would leave wide open spaces for the other one. Last season we didn't enjoy that at all, as Suarez left and Sturridge was injured. We played most of the season with Sterling up front and he had the shot power of a limp cock.

Even ones that relate to matters that are devolved in Scotland (Like the NHS or education), often have consequences to Scotland, as the money Scotland is allocated is directly tied to English spending. EVEL will only serve to fracture the UK further.

I tend to take the view that the best solution to the West Lothian question is to stop asking it. It really isn't that big a deal.

null,false,gundog48,null,null,null,"Depends, want to do it legit or not? We've been doing much the same thing lately, it's very easy to do. We've got BT broadband which we've been really happy with having switched from Tiscali/TalkTalk, it also comes with BT Sport included. With that done, you can get a BTTV box which is basically a HD Freeview box which will also do BT Sport, between that, BBC and ITV you'll have most of your sport covered if that's something you're interested in, I've found that to be the most awkward bit. This will just cost £30 for them to ship the box to you, which is a lot cheaper than equivalent Freeview boxes as I understand.

The thing has an interface for Netflix, so if you want to subscribe to Netflix you can massively increase your on-demand TV for a very small price and without any real fuckery.

I've also set up an on-demand system of my own, but it's not legit if that's important. Raspberry Pi set up with XBMC plugged into the TV, networked, and controlled with a normal remote. Then I've got a server on the network (it doesn't need to be dedicated, you can use your normal PC if you wanted, though wired is best), put a 3TB HDD in it, and host all the files in a public folder. Films can be downloaded manually, for TV shows, especially ongoing ones, Sickbeard is an amazing tool. Set up the sources, I use The Pirate Bay and a few other public trackers, then tell it which TV shows you want to watch along with your quality settings and it'll get you up to date and download new episodes as soon as they are released. It'll even tell the Raspberry Pi to update it's sources once it's done. You may want to go with a good VPN like PIA for security. XBMC is a nice interface, this would also be a great opportunity to centralise your music and photos to be played and viewed from the TV and automatically backed up. If you're serious about centralising music, you can use JRiver Media Center (absolutely fantastic). This'll sync up the music you choose on your phone, including organising it into playlists and other cool stuff like streaming your music on your phone when you're on the network, ideal if you have a big library but small storage capacity on your phone. Just cuts the bullshit out of organising music. Organise it on one device and it's organised for all of them. But I digress.

Doing this setup can be a bit of hassle, but it's fantastic! You can do away with all your DVDs, you get box sets of your favourite TV shows to watch in proper order and you'll be kept up to date with shows as the episodes come out. The interface and convenience is better than anything legit I know of, and gives you the ultimate control. If you're thinking of making a server specifically for this (which can double up for a variety of server applications as well as a media one), you may as well forget the Raspberry Pi and make it a HTPC and plug the server straight into your TV!

So we cut our £60+ a month Sky subscription and got something better for £30 one-off on the box and £7/mo for Netflix (which you may already have). The other setup is free to run, far better, but requires more setup. You may have the parts like I did to set it up virtually free, can get a little pricy doing it from scratch, but there's no better alternative I've found!",null,0,null,1436825386,null,0,1436825587,0,ct27yjf,null,t3_3d48h0,null,t1_ct27yjf,null,t3_3d48h0,null,null,null,1437829785,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

FRESHERS

Brighton would like to welcome the craziest, most originally bonkers class of Freshers ever to assault our boring old town with their zany carefree young energy.
Just like we've welcomed every other class of totally unique freshers  for about five decades.

Seriously kids, we are not interested in student antics and we are bored by frantic attempts to stand out from the crown and look 'edgy'. We will tolerate the contrived stupidity of Freshers Week as you lurch drunkenly around the level  and North Laine, but that's it.

After that, please save your embarrassment and our patience by confining your stunt-drinking to the University bars where they are used to dealing with projectile vomit and soiled underwear.
If you really MUST venture into town, learn how to use public transport.  We realise it's difficult not having mummy to  take you to wherever you need to go, but the bus drivers aren't a substitute for her. Learn where the buses go. The only bus which goes from the campus at Falmer to the centre of town is the 25 and the N25 night bus. There is no point forming a queue to get on any other bus so you can each ask the driver, in turn, ""Do you go to the University?""

Yes there are a lot of pubs in Brighton. You are not obliged to visit them all. Some are aimed at students, some at holiday visitors, and some at residents. Stick to what you know. Brighton may be fluffy on the surface but it also has a mean underside.  

Just because it's there doesn't mean you have to get in it. The Sea, that is. Swimming off Brighton beach is, at best, tolerable.  If you've ever swum in the Med or the Caribbean you'll rate Brighton as One Star. Tombstoning off the Pier or the groynes kills kids like you regularly, so don't do it. Swimming off Brighton and alcohol don't mix.

I'm wondering which formation we'll play next season. Our wingers (only Ibe and Markovic, basicly) are young lads not ready (imo) to be regular starters in a top 4 Premier League side (which is our ambition). And we have many great attacking midfielders, and two strikers that should both start when fit (assuming we get Benteke). 

That points towards us playing a formation with AMs instead of wingers, something like the [4-3-2-1](http://i.imgur.com/k7DBFjH.png) or [4-2-3-1](http://i.imgur.com/4I9IQnE.jpg) (if we only have one fit striker), or the [4-2-2-2](http://i.imgur.com/uFJvAYG.png) (when both strikers are fit).

Your memory is short. The video of him being knocked down was not CCTV footage. It was footage from an American tourist.

If you remember the police initially said there were no CCTV cameras in the area.

People walked around and found 6 pointing in the direction of Tomlinson's final moments. 

The police then changed their tune to all 6 were not working and there is no footage from those 6 independent cameras.

Ask yourself the probabilities all 6 were not working that day?

More likely that the footage was erased in an attempt to cover it up.

In general, I know that Manchester medics are very employable, have very good communication skills (drilled into us from year 1) and are quite prepared to be a junior doctor. The downturn is that our knowledge of the basic scientific principles is less good than our clinical knowledge and our anatomy knowledge is pretty poor.

The fact that there are so many elements to being a doctor makes it hard to pin down a 'best uni' and the league tables that include stats such as how good the research is aren't a true representation. I'd say they are all pretty much the same on average but each medical school produces graduates with different qualities.

 I mean it's just so hard to predict.

Also he is coming from playing under Marcelo Beilsa (Poch's mentor) which is an extra plus.

Moses and Marin were bought as emergency backups (Moses homegrown) because we weren't sure about our ability to get Champions League football the next season - and then we did and went on to sign Oscar and Hazard. It's cost us money but I'm sure glad we got those players in case things turned out for the worst.

McEachran, Baker (who you can't include in this list because he's had one bloody loan spell) and Swift are part of our youth teams, we never paid a fee for them.

Ake is currently part of our first team setup.

Romeu recently signed a new deal, we paid €4 million for him from Barca and we can easily fetch £6-7 million.

Even look at bloody Kakuta, who is by far our worst youth transfer story, and we're getting a solid €4 million from his transfer.

It may only work 5% of the time, but for what we lose on those 95% it's damn worth it.

The second point is simply moral, you have been paid for these hours, you didn't realise it but you have had the money and spent it and not worked the hours. It is the same situation for my benefit client's and their overpayments, the DWP / HMRC are usually very flexible on time limits but ultimately they just want their money back. It has been paid to them, and whether it was a mistake on the client's part of not informing them of a material change, or they processed their paperwork wrong, they just want it back.

My starting point here would be to perhaps negotiate on the number of hours that are owed vs what you actually need to work, and the time frame in repaying them, two 10 hours weekends in a row plus however the x1 is framed seems especially harsh.",null,0,null,1436826573,null,0,1436828614,0,ct28p2e,null,t3_3d6d9t,null,t1_ct28p2e,null,t3_3d6d9t,null,null,null,1437830302,null,6,false,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,6,null

**88-91 with Cagliari** - leads them to 2 straight promotions from Serie C1 to Serie A, but 92-93 saw them fight for and win a European place, and the following season reach the semis of the Uefa Cup under Mazzone.

**91-93 with Napoli** - Coming off the heels of the Maradona era and Serie A winners just 2 seasons before, Ranieri's men went on to finish 4th, then 11th in his two seasons there.

**93-97 with Fiorentina** - After reaching Serie A and building his team around Batistuta and Rui Costa among others, his second season the team finished 10th. Next season they finished 4th and won the Coppa Italia, but Ranieri's final season they ended up 9th. In the following seasons La Viola finished 5th and 3rd under Malesani and Trappatoni respectively.

**97-99 with Valencia** - Signed and groomed some of the team's best players in this period. Won a CdR and qualification for CL, but the team made the CL final the year after he left. And only a couple seasons later won La Liga.

**1999-00 with Atleti** - Club turmoil led to the club being relegated after he resigned.

**2000-04 with Chelsea** - Obvious one for many here. His teams improved their points total each year. He eventually got Chelsea second in 03-04 (behind Arsenal's Invincibles) and to the semis of the CL. But he was ousted in favor of hot new manager Jose Mourinho, and the rest as they say, is history.

**04-05 with Valencia** - took over for Rafa Benitez who had just won La Liga and the UEFA Cup. Starting well but slumping by October, they were eliminated from the CL in the group stages, with a 5-1 home thumping by Inter the icing on the cake.

Every single thing the DWP has done since the tories came back into power has made me come closer and closer to having to work, or live in poverty, even though I simply cannot work. Since the new benefit sanctions have come in, a lot of the people I know with real, visible disabilities, have been taken off their ESA, and made to feel like criminals because of it. 

That's just one thing, but its the closest thing to my heart, because i am a part of it. I live in the north, and it honestly feels like if you live in a city up here, there is absolutely no interest in getting people into work, jobs are so scarce hundreds of people are applying for one position, and at the same time, the people looking for work get their jobseekers allowance cut if they fall ill and miss their appointment. This happened to my cousin, who is now luckily in a very good job. They laid someone of the other day from his work who was on a zero hours contract on the spot because he said something the boss didnt like, and got someone else in to work for a few weeks before laying them off too. 

My university department went on strike earlier in the year, because even though my tuition fees have gone up 3 times, the actual professors haven't got a pay rise in years. All of the council houses are now private, which means EVERYONE under the age of 24 who I know HAS to rent, because they cant afford the house prices, despite them currently building hundreds of houses in my city every year. 

I look in the media every day, and see people calling me a leech to society, the newspapers running the articles best friends with the people in power, and think why the hell is this allowed to happen? All the while, they get richer because of tax avoidance, and people like me get closer and closer to the poverty line, even though the benefits I and the people I know recieve are hardly a dent in the taxes corporations dodge each year. I voted labour, but it didnt mean shit, because my vote didnt count for anything anyway, as I'm in a labour stronghold, and EVEN THOUGH they got more votes than the tories, they have far less seats, and wonder what the hell this democracy is we live in where my vote doesn't count and the only people who speak for me get laughed at by the media in the government's pocket. 

I don't hate the tories, I feel sorry for them, and I dont think they're evil, I think they have no idea what they're doing to people. That being said, I certainly dont like labour, theyre just the better option of two shitty options, even though they have no interest in breaking the status quo which makes me essentially disenfranchised.

 - Lies on a massive scale to the electorate (see the ""we could be Greece"" nonsense, or the more recent promises on tax credits or the NHS). Governments should at least try to implement what they say beforehand. The lie about the state of the economy is both bad for the general understanding of a complex subject by the electorate and does down our economy.

 - Selling off assets that the British people have worked hard and paid taxes to create, mostly to people with financial links to the party.

 - Using the office of government for party political propaganda (see tax pie chart)

 - Not following evidence anywhere, from drug policy, to the economy, to the benefits system. 

 - Trying to increase the inequality in wealth that harms people's well being and the country's growth.

 - Joining in on the demonising of it's own citizens, be they poor, disabled or Muslim.

 - Basically appealing to all that is nasty and selfish in our personalities.

 - Massively increasing state surveillance despite it's potential harm in the future.

To take it a bit more philosophical. By Christian standards they are evil. God represents the left, he's all about giving and sharing and following the rules and being all seeing. Lucifer the right in terms of individuality, selfishness and breaking the rules a bit. Of course we need both sides, but only one need nourishing. Self interest doesn't need a lobby, it's constantly present in us all, what takes effort is love and forgiveness.

Now, if you asked me about New Labour, I'd say I'd agree that they do a lot of things wrong, but I'd also argue they're not that left wing.

Very much this. Being a member of the Beveridge Group doesn't necessarily mean that Farron is a ""social democrat"" by any means, even if it does promote a synthesis of social welfare policies with economic liberalism. No-one would state, for example, that the ordoliberal is in any way shape or form a ""social democrat"", and that's ignoring the very fact that social democracy doesn't necessarily require an emphasis on liberal beliefs. The most accurate label, shockingly enough, is the label ""social liberal"".

As for Lamb being classified as a Classical Liberal, I could go back to the ordoliberal example as a social liberal tradition based upon classical liberal ideology - ""classical liberalism"" and ""economic liberalism"" are not synonymous, even if there is a lot of overlap (making the calling of Lamb as a ""classical liberal"" perhaps less controversial/incorrect as the labeling of Farron as a social democrat). 

To my knowledge, both Lamb and Farron champion  civil liberties (i.e. immigration, freedom of speech etc.) and political freedoms, representative democracy, and emphasize economic freedom (even if, taking a social liberal stance, there is the emphasis on the breaking of oligopolies as a means of reducing inequalities/lack of competition and the provision of some form of welfare), making both adequately fall under the label of classical liberalism.",null,0,null,1436828534,null,0,false,0,ct29vhc,null,t3_3cp1o0,null,t1_ct29vhc,null,t1_csxpa3r,null,null,null,1437831156,null,1,false,LibDem,t5_2qwov,1,null

We also contributed to the [bailout of Portugal](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12995382) to the tune of [£4bn](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2011/04/what_is_the_uks_contribution_t.html) through the EFSM, which we also used to contribute to Ireland. 

So these kinds of bailout are very definitely something to do with us as well. 

Our exposure to the EFSM is currently at 12% which is agreed by our government and Europe. That means we are expected to contribute up to 12% of any EFSM loans which are made.

The EFSM is also a hugely useful reputable lender on behalf of countries which are suffering credit rating cuts. By being funded by contributions from stronger economies its credit rating remains high and so it can borrow at much lower rates and therefore issue bonds and loans to fund the countries needing a bailout.

This is very much in our interest as Europe's leading financial services provider, and totally a precedent in our relationship with Europe.

null,false,fiery_mergoat,null,null,null,"Apologies for the delayed response. Your reply is very thoughtful and has made me see some positives to what I've felt has been a frustrating situation. 

In terms of why, I just want a space to call my own that won't be taken from me because the landlord wants to sell or increase the rent. If a scheme existed where I could rent somewhere indefinitely with no shocks, and with room for home improvements, I'd go for that quite happily. I wanted my mindset to be challenged a bit too; home ownership is a good idea, a sound investment but is also aspirational and something a lot of us put in our ""life goals"" in this country. I want to remove the latter reason from my thought process and try to instead focus on the logical side of why it's right or wrong for me. 

That brings me to my next point. What you said about investing in myself and benefiting from my current flexibility is a strong point. I've been restless in my mother's home since I was 19, feeling increasingly like a ""woman-child"". I keep feeling annoyed that almost everyone in the past was able to take leaving home in their teens/twenties for granted, because it's such a powerful statement of adulthood. That, coupled with the fact that my home now legitimately has the equivalent of 2 grown women's lifelong possessions (clearouts etc accounted for) and simple things like space and privacy are getting me down. However, allowing myself to make the largest financial decision ever based on restlessness and frustration would be daft and pretty suicidal. I've never properly been in debt, never needed a credit card or taken a loan (except for a year's worth of uni) and I want to maintain my stress-free financial life for as long as possible. 

I think ultimately I'm going to tap into my once amazing saving skills (you'd be surprised how much a 14 year old can buy on weeks and weeks' worth of unspent lunch money and found change) and see where it takes me. I've always liked the idea of having a nest egg anyway. I also have other things I'd want to do like actually get a degree, which may not be paid for by my job etc. If I focused all financial goals on owning a home ""as soon as possible"" I'd probably push that off my to-do list entirely. 

I haven't ruled out renting or buying in the next few years, far from it. But I think seeing the good in my circumstances and understanding a bit more about the straightforward investment options out there has bolstered me and cheered me up.

Unfortunately, I've long forgotten what the product code for the fabric is but if you route around for a while you should ne able to find it, unless it is out if stock (I'd do it myself but I'm on mobile). 
I don't think it's ridiculously expensive as far as fabrics go, but it may still *too* expensive for the average cosplayer. Really, any dark blue wool will probably work, however. 
The alternative is to buy a replica, or one in a similar style from Crombie themselves. But you're probably looking at £700ish for one from Crombie and £100ish for a replica on eBay.

The lining of the coat is not solid red but rather a red and black pattern that from a distance can look solid red. It's made from silk by an Italian company that has long since stopped making it, the production team probably bought one of the last bolts available. But you would be looking for something like [this](/http://i.imgur.com/5vpuBfI.jpg). To be honest, I have no idea where you'd find something like this, so maybe solid red silk would be both easier and cheaper to find.

The trousers I *think* were G-Star RAW, the same as those worn by the Eleventh Doctor. I'm actually not sure if I am right here, but I'm fairly sure that's were they come from. 

The white shirt is by Bud, the purple by Paul Smith, the cardigan by Smeedly (I think it's called) and I still haven't found the holey jumper from *The Caretaker* yet, nor of anything official about the waistcoat in *Dark Water*.

The boots he wears are **not** Doc Martens. But they are accurate enough however and Doc Martens are cool and you should be them. 

If you are wanting to save money, then there are a couple things you could do. You could cosplay as the 12th Doctor in *The Caretaker* as a warehouse coat is a lot less expensive to buy.

Or [Minor costume spoilers for series 9](#s ""you could cosplay as the Doctor in series 9. The Doctor seems to wear some t-shirts that are fairly easy to source, I've just lost the links at the moment. He also wears a burgundy velvet coat in some episodes rather than a navy blue one."")

Somebody forgot to mention this to Schevchenko, Veron, Deco, Robinho, and Crespo. 

&gt;Has shown good quality- for a mid table team and hasn't even been that good (especially for 30 million)  

He is averaging a nearly .5 goal per game ratio with Villa and the shit midfield that they have. That is actually quite impressive considering his lack of service. You're talking out of your ass here. Whether or not he's worth 30m I'll talk about later. 

&gt;Willing to come to LFC- not a good reason to sign someone

You miss the point entirely. It's not a reason to sign someone, it's a required part of the deal. Even if we found the perfect 2 million pound striker that will 100% be the next Messi, it means fuck all if they won't come to LFC. That's the point. 

&gt;Can make an immediate impact on the first team

I'll admit this is the trickiest part of the deal, but obviously the club thinks that Benteke has the best potential to do this. I think I'll trust their judgement instead of a random dude on the internet who doesn't think so. 

Again, if 30 million is the price we have to pay, then we pay it. I would rather pay 25m, or 10m or 1m, but how happy you are about the price doesn't factor into it. You do what you *need* to do. When we bought Coutinho, him working straight away was a happy surprise and a huge bonus- that does't mean that is what we were trying to do with him. 

&gt;we should be able to find a striker better than Benteke for less than 30 million. 

You keep saying this, but you have yet to offer any alternative that is *clearly* better than Benteke, is worth less than 30m, and would come to LFC. If we were Madrid we could sit here and take our pick of a dozen great strikers for 15m, but that's not who we are. Players aren't as keen to come here, meaning we have to spend more on many targets that could be better than Benteke, and I guarantee you it would be more than 30m for all of them. We need to make shrewd purchases and spend the money we need to in order to get back to scoring goals.

null,false,TrickyDickNixonbot,,Michael Foot 2: Jeremy Corbyn Boogaloo,null,"&gt; Agreed on Brown, I don't know why we gave up on that, the Tories brought us into a double-dip recession.

This requires a long exposition on Keynesian economics that i'll deliver if you want, but there's a reason Ed Balls (who penned economic policy) did not go anti-austerity. Our position was perfectly consistent with the Brown plan from that perspective. The fact the Tories cut the stimulus off before it was completed is what complicated everything.

&gt; That's your opinion but which public are you talking about? Scotland is mysteriously not part of this 'public' you're talking about? Or is it just a meteoric rise in nationalism between the day after the referendum and today? I somehow doubt it.

I will become convinced of Scotland's anti-'right-wing Labour' when the fact that Blair swept Scotland thrice and Brown swept it once ceases to be a fact and reality alters itself. The rejection of Labour was because of a meteoric rise in nationalism before and after the referendum, the phenomenon of Scottish nationalism in itself is a huge debate, and considering the SNP can be duplicitous as fuck (privatising ferries, advocating economic policies that impose billions more in cuts than Labour would have) without any widespread scrutiny further demonstrates that this goes beyond political agendas.

&gt; We lost because we didn't combat Tory lies, no-one believed Ed when he said he wouldn't form a coalition with the SNP and you seem to be forgetting that before the Tories started their campaign that the SNP would hold the balance of power they tried the 'Red Ed' campaign and no one gave a shit.

The Red Ed campaign, and the portrayal of Ed as a blithering geek by the media, were massively damaging. Writing it off wont get us anywhere. Labour being irresponsible with the money and socialism being fiscally irresponsible etc etc etc was a huge doorstep gripe I had to deal with from Reading to Sussex, as were complaints of ""im not voting Labour because Ed cant lead Britain'. In fact SNP fears almost took a back seat. I think Ed was an honest, sincere man, one of the best leaders we've had, but this is the TV age. In the TV age its about looking flashy and good for the camera and projecting confidence. As that one guy said on BBC, Ed Miliband 'was too fucking honest and good for Britain'

&gt; Do you really think the average voter is sat at home thinking ""Oh I tell you what that Ed Miliband seems like he'd create a dictatorship of the proletariat based on working class self-emancipation and mass democracy, fuck that I need to vote Tory.""

While the average Libertarian probably was thinking that, no. The average voter was thinking 'oh Labour are those socialist guys and socialists spend a lot of money and we dont have much money so im not gonna vote for them. Also their leader is awkward and probably wouldnt make a good Prime Minister'. I can also run a few other thought processes for those who went and voted UKIP, which was a different kind of defection.

&gt; We offered no credible alternative, just the same austerity with a few sweeteners irrelevant to most people.

Then you clearly didn't read the manifesto. This is my problem with the Labour left, they have to try and dumb everything down into these stupid, outright false paradigms, and in turn you just back up the Tory narratives. We failed to argue our policies properly and combat the lies thrown at the Brown administration. There are immense reasons behind why we did not adopt 'anti-austerity' from a professional economic standpoint, and we certainly did not 'offer the same old austerity with sweeteners nobody cared about'. People dont go and vote Tory because Labour is too right-wing. Honestly if you think our platform was *that* bad, you might as well go and defect to the Greens. Also, if you think anti-austerity is somehow appealing to the British public right now, I suggest you go and check out the collapse of Greece under Syriza, the public face of the New Left in Europe, and the probable soon collapse of Spain when Podemos takes power.",null,0,null,1436832070,null,0,false,0,ct2bwb3,null,t3_3d5w21,null,t1_ct2bwb3,null,t1_ct2bh91,null,null,null,1437832676,null,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

What is written on the back of the party card? Democratic Socialism, and if you don't like it you can [git out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fZZqDJXOVg) I joke of course, but seriously why are you writing off socialism? 

Every country set up as a socialist country has went against the principles of dialectical marxism and while I'm not advocating FULLCOMMUNISM, I think it's remarkably foolish to write off an entire ideology because it might be seen as a step backwards. 

Here's the view of Ed from someone on the left of Labour, that I haven't seen mentioned. He was all over the place, at the start of his leadership he was talking about how he would break from New Labour and how he would bring socialist values to No.10 if elected.

 By polling day he had hired Alistair Campbell as an adviser(someone who was very quick to criticise him after the election along with Umunna) and had given an interview saying he'd be the 'champion' to One-Nation Tories. 

He made some great speeches about 'predatory' business that weren't expanded upon and he's now been characterised as anti-business. For me he tried to speak to the right of the party and the far-left and completely ignored the cente-left, alienating many voters up and down the country.

We lost in Scotland because the leader of Scottish Labour was a raging Blairite, we gave credence to the 'Red Tory' insult by running a pro-union campaign alongside the Tories, which [Charles Kennedycan explain](https://youtu.be/K1NJx8g97GU?t=49s).

 Trident was a big issue too and Labour offered no alternative, just less. We should not be saying ""We can do it better than the Tories."" We should be saying ""We will take a different approach.""

Really though. Is that your only form of attack? It's poor satire. Only tackling one line huh? You must agree with the rest then. Which only begs the question as to why we disagree so much? I actually do hope you make some points and prove me wrong, somewhere. I prefer those with reason. It means that I am being disagreed with on such a basis. Ultimately highlighting that, to convince you, all I have to do is provide the better reasoning. If I can't do that I wouldn't know where to start. A man of no reason can't, from reason, compromise. You'd have to start with an education though. In that hypothetical situation.

I don't understand what's wrong with the passage you cited. Do you disagree with what I said? What is so ridiculous about it? If you read further down you'll see that I even gave a single example. Rather narrow for such a claim I admit. What requires the need for sarcasm?

You're part of the problem I mentioned. It's people like you, assuming you're not a troll, who are filled with prejudice against UKIP. Look through your comment history and take a guess as to which remarks I am talking about. The language you used to tarnish my claim, ""conspiracy"", is shameful as well. It has been long corrupted.

You should make a point to reflect on and change your approach to debate. Stop being a sarcastic twat for starters. Holy water may cure the bigotry. Stop framing malice. Don't appeal to emotional language. Don't quote without related discussion. Understand what should, isn't and that reality isn't how you feel it should be. Maybe have a quick browse on logical fallacies (Wikipedia has collected a mountain's worth). It would make discussion with you *a lot* more welcoming. Also, quit the memes, they're silly.

I will say, though, that I'd rather spend money replacing Schneiderlin as opposed to buying another CB. I know this sounds crazy, but from what I watched on Saturday, Yoshida has all the qualities to be Fonte's partner in the back. Smart, composed on the ball, and great sense of anticipation.

He also impressed in the first half of 2014-15, but his form dropped significantly in January. Since then, he has done fuck all. He managed to miss numerous 1on1s, and even completely butchered a sitter. Around this period, Coutinho picked up his form massively. He absolutely created every attack, while Sterling was sulking and giving away possession needlessly. Again, Sterling was one of our best players, but both Coutinho and Sturridge are above him.

&gt;If we're talking about calories burnt during exercise, yes, there is a difference, but I wouldn't say it is BF related per se. I was talking about weight loss trough calorie management only. Amount of BF won't make a difference when the person isn't in motion. 

Yes it does, if you are bigger, either fatter or more muscular, then when you are resting you need more calories to maintain your weight at rest. So if your a man and you take in your recommended 2500 calories a day and you are at 30% BF, then you'll definitely lose weight, because even when resting your body is constantly burning calories. So if you are fatter then your body burns more calories at rest, than say someone muscular at 15% BF.



&gt;The reason people with higher BF often burn more during a run or a walk is because they may be less fit so their body is less efficient at managing the energy. 

Simply not true. 

The reason they burn more calories is because they are fatter (bigger). Which means the calories they need for say ten steps, is what a skinny person would need for 50 steps (not accurate, just making a point), again not because they aren't used to it, but because they burn more calories because they are fatter.

Think of it like this, a fat person may need 5,000 calories to maintain their weight and so if they go on a run (and they are obviously bigger) then they will lose more weight than someone with lower BF. It's why it becomes so hard to lose your last ten pounds or stone, because your body is expending less energy to maintain your weight because you are smaller.

And yes hormones do play a part, Testosterone (which men have significantly higher levels) is known to be a fat burning accelerator and to help you maintain your weight easier.

Generally speaking, for your interest, these days the right does not see Labour as a party that is for the benefit of the UK - quite the opposite - whether right or wrong, many right-wing people see Labour as a party with a hidden agenda.

The ""right"" has the general mentality that life is tough and you get what you work for. Work hard, stick up for each other, and we shall prevail. The right's consensus of the left's mentality is *those who work hard are ""nazis"" who want to steal everyone's money and those who are unable to work hard (for whatever reason) are trodden on victims who need bottle feeding*.

null,false,aenor,null,null,null,"&gt;Generally speaking, for your interest, these days the right does not see Labour as a party that is for the benefit of the UK - quite the opposite

What did you think of New Labour? I thought the first ten years (1997 - 2007) really helped the whole of the UK. People did well, infrastructure got fixed.

When Lab came to power in 1997 NHS waiting lists were 2 years long and people were dying on them. When they left power, they were down to a mere six weeks (they've grown sharply again under the Conservatives). It probably doesn't seem important if you are in your 20's and good health - but as soon as you hit your thirties, you are having children, your body starts going wrong, and the service becomes important. And if you are elderly, you use it a lot.

Do you know how Lab got those lists down? Increased capacity. We built, equiped and staffed 149 new hospitals, plus modernised existing hospitals to take new equipment- you wouldn't believe how hard it was to modernise old hospitals like Guys - they were built in pre electric/pre cable times, it was a structural nightmare. Increased capacity meant people didn't need to wait. And if that capacity hadn't been increased, we would be in real trouble right now - waiting lists would be up to three or four years and people would be taking out insurance.

We think the whole of Britain benefited from what we did in the NHS. But how do people like you see it? Do you think we shouldn't have bothered to increase capacity? After all it cost money. Would you have let the service die and gone for insurance instead?

What I'm trying to get at is that the money that was spent wasn't spent on benefits. Unemployment was unusually low for most of Labour's period of office - it was usually about 4%, whereas during the Thatcher-Major years it was around 8%, they spent more helping the out-of-work than Blair did. Wages were good too - the whole zero hours thing didn't become widespread till the coalition took power. When people are in work and earning well, benefits arn't really required. We did spend money - but it was spent on hospitals. 149 of them.",null,0,null,1436837442,null,0,1436837865,0,ct2f222,null,t3_3d46j9,null,t1_ct2f222,null,t1_ct2ej5y,null,null,null,1437834964,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null

However, my personal grievance with labour is primarily their abolishment of grammar schools in favour of comprehensive schools. At risk of blowing my own trumpet, in school I was not an idiot, I was for the most part at the top of my class. So when I was still being taught solids, liquids and gasses in year 8, when I had already memorized and understood the periodic table by year 5 (I admit I have since forgotten it, possibly proving my point) and learned the basics of nuclear energy by year 7, and having to wait to be educated for teachers explaining basic arithmetic to people who simply didn't care, I lost hope that the education system would maximize my potential.

For my A-levels I started to re-learn what I had forgotten by year 9.

My point here is, whilst Labour (or New Labour, I don't know) emphasize helping the underdog, they completely neglect those at the other end of the spectrum which, believe it or not, need just as much help in their young age, just a different kind of help. My life during and after school degraded. I became jaded and angry and then depressed... I felt betrayed. Nowadays I am in a moderately good position, but I had to claw my way up from the repercussions of an ineffective schooling system that ignored my efforts.

Referencing my previous point, my efforts to work hard were rewarded with total disregard and those who couldn't be bothered were spoon fed. I feel that my optimistic childhood was shat on, frankly. And it's not much different in life nowadays.

I don't doubt that the Conservatives played a part in this somewhere, but fundamentally the Labour ideology of ""everyone is equal"" has only been a detriment to my life.",null,0,null,1436838718,null,0,1436841798,0,ct2ftli,null,t3_3d46j9,null,t1_ct2ftli,null,t1_ct2f222,null,null,null,1437835531,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

Haven't set it up, but appears to be functionally identical to the 10th Doctor's remote (which I also own).  The biggest difference is that this one is powered by 2 AAA batteries, rather than a built-in rechargeable battery.  Dunno whether that's a plus or a minus, since I don't know how much it'll drain the batteries.  Changing batteries is a bit of a chore--unscrew the ring in the middle of the screwdriver to reveal two tiny screws in the housing inside, unscrew the screws, then twist and pull out the upper half a la the ""build your own Sonic"" kits; the batteries go in the handle.

Size-wise practically identical to the Character Options toy.  Unlike the toy (and like the real prop), extends by flicking rather than a spring-loaded mechanism.  

Nice and hefty.  Claws and the upper outer casing are metal.  Chrome-ey on the ""brass"" parts. The internal green ""tube"" that goes to the emitter isn't clear, but has a bit of a flecked marble look.

Unlike the 10th Doctor's remote, no cool case--just the cardboard box with molded plastic interior packaging.

I would like to clarify what a few have commented about though; currently we have a top class RB in Debuchy, however, he's going to be at that level for another 1 or 2 years.  Arsene wants to lock down Jenko for the long term.  With the emergence of Bellerin, and with Jenko playing first team football for a well managed side like the Hammers, it makes perfect sense.  We get to develop a promising young player, and another talented player gets to continue to hone his skills and improve with you while staying close to home.  With us, he simply wouldnt have first team football for at least another season or two.  4.5 million is a bit steep for a loan IMHO, but I think Jenko will put in another solid performance this year for you all and keep you competing at a  top level.  Many of us were upset when we heard the rumors that Sunderland were in for him, simply because he is better suited in the Hammers system and has gone from strength to strength with you, Sunderland would be a step backward.

null,false,aenor,null,null,null,"Regarding the grammar schools. A bit of history - I feel like a wise old owl today imparting stuff that you young 'uns don't know :-)

This will come as a complete shock to you, but grammar schools were introduced by Attlee's government, and he in turn was following a report by Beveridge done in the middle of the war (yes, in the middle of all the bombs there were people beavering away working on the future).

They came under attack immediately. You see, to enter the grammar, you needed to pass the 11-plus. And lots of middle class people found that their little darlings were failing the exams, and their places were being taken by dreadful oiks from the working classes! 

To make things worse, the secondary moderns (which is where the 90% who failed their 11-plus went) were shite squared. They didn't bother to teach anything academic, or anything useful at all. They were still turning out hand carpenters in the 1960's when machine-processed wood had taken over industry a whole fifty years earlier. It wasn't a big problem in the 1950's when low-skill jobs were aplenty, but in an era of automation, turning out children like that is to doom them to poverty.

Then there was the problem that some children matured later than others. So if you came into your own at 12 instead of 11, and hadn't done well at your 11-plus, that was your life utterly ruined. You were destined for a grotty factory job or down the mine even if you had the capacity to become a scientist.

In other words, the grammars worked like a dream for the 10% who got in, but didn't work for the 90% who didn't. And govts have to consider the 90%...

The first comprehensives were introduced under Macmillan in the early 1960's, to fix what they thought of as Attlee's mistakes. They were supposed to solve the problem of the 11-year old cut-off, and solve the problem of 10% getting a good education and 90% getting rubbish. Put everyone into one school, *stream the classes* (very important) and then if a child improved, you moved them up a stream. Your school should have had streaming, so you didn't need to sit with the slow ones, you should have been in the top stream. A side effect if you were middle class, was that the school depended on where you lived - so unlike in the grammars where all the social classes mixed, if you lived in a nice neighbourhood you didn't have to mix with the oiks.

Then there was a problem with the teachers. Some of them were complete and utter lazy-arses. How do you deal with that. Well ""control-freak"" New Labour dealt with it by having lots of exams and lots of inspections. Exams at age 7, 9, 11 etc etc, and the local authority can look at teh stats, spot the outlying schools which were underperforming, and send in the inspectors. Teachers hated it of course (and the SNP in Scotland have abolished the whole exams and inspection regime and seen outcomes drop).

I'm not sure you realise this, but local authorities have the power to bring back grammars if they want, and the county of Kent still has it's grammars and secondary moderns. However, you'll find that most authorities (tory, lab, LibDem) haven't gone down that route because of the problems I've out-lined. And in Kent, the kids who go to secondary modern (i.e. 90% of the kids) are underperforming those in comprehensives. And there shouldn't be much difference because we're dealing with the vast majority here.

The answer to the problem you faced in school would be enforcing streaming and challenging schools that don't offer it. 

Also - and this is an unpopular thing to say - outcomes in schools are correlated with parental involvement. Are they making their child do their homework. Are they volunteering to sit on the school board. Because schools are much like small businesses - they all have sub-cultures develop and the people best placed to watch that are the parents. It's hard for an education minister to micromanage the education of some 10 million kids. But sadly parents can't be arsed to volunteer, and teachers don't like to be inspected. 

The reason old school people like myself are worried about the free-school thing the Conservatives are pushing is because it takes them outside the control of inspectors and the local authority, they don't even need to hire teachers of minimum standards. Hard experience suggests that if you don't watch them like hawks and enforce standards, they slack and produce poor results - but I guess that's my Labour control-freakery coming out!

Given your enthusiasm for grammars, how would you fix the problems I outlined?

It is my understanding that ""if you fail the 11+ you are doomed"" is myth, and that it was possible that if you excelled in a secondary modern you could be ""promoted"" to a grammar school, or something to that effect.

Also, crushing the ambitions of that 10% to appease the other 90% is not moral, regardless of the reasons behind it. Besides the obvious consequence that you chastise the nation of that 10% of very useful people (didn't these people originally maneuver  Britain into world leader it is today? plus that 90% working in ""grotty factories and mines"" who built it?).

Perhaps a lack of secondary moderns teaching vocational subjects is partly why this country has no industry nowadays (aside from thatcher etc.)?

My grampa left school at 15 with bugger all qualifications, but he was clever. Through hard work and applying himself ""in a grotty factory"" (a cotton mill specifically) he became the became a mill [engineering] manager, so you point there is definitely not entirely accurate.

What are people like myself supposed to do? Squander our abilities? If I didn't force myself to work extra hard (which was a depressing and painful process) I would have easily gone down the route of idle druggy, which was truthfully a high risk possibility for myself had I not ""pulled myself together"".

These are some thoughts but I am a bit too ""out of it"" this moment to think deeper...

Modern comprehensives are shit at doing the one thing they are there for: teaching.

Consider: you are in a shitty secondary modern, and you then lose *an entire year* of academic education. No-one would even discover that you have matured and no-one would help you catch up - so how could you join the grammar at age 12?

Regarding your grampa - people were able to work their way up back in the day. It's impossible now - you are judged by your cv and if it doesn't have the quals, you don't even get an interview.

I suppose one solution to the problem you describe would be hot-housing. Say in an area of about 500,000 people (so two small towns), you could set up a hothouse school and send the particularly bright kids there. So one hothouse and the rest normal comps. But that kinds of thing needs local authority control over all the schools in the area. 

If you have free-schools opting out, and various schools doing their own thing, you don't get enough pupils to make the hothouse school viable. If it's not viable, it won't happen (council tax restrictions, the money the tax can go up is capped and grants from central govt have been cut, which means money for schools is cut).

*In theory* a group of parents could set up their own hothouse school using the Conservatives free-school thing, which is funded directly by the dept of education. But none have - all the free-schools seem to be done by religious nutters, or people wanting to make a fast buck - so take the money, then skimp by hiring people who don't even have teaching certificates, and profit.

So to make it work, we'd need to put the local authority back in charge. But that's not popular - everyone wants to do their own thing.

They don't miss out now. Back in the grammar era, 10% went to grammar schools and that 10% went to university. Now the numbers going to university are about 40%. So even if your local authority is rubbish, you can catch up further down the line because there are ample opportunities, and when you go to university catch up completely - as you did :-) We're actually losing fewer good people under the current system than we did under the old one.

Factories - at the moment they fall into two different types. The chicken-plucking type where you do mindless work but they have to hire you because they haven't yet figured out how to automate. And the skilled ones where complex machines are performing the tasks (think car factories) and you are actually a controller of the machines - so knowledge of basic maths and science and familiarity with computers helps. But the latter is rare in Britain. 

I don't know what the future is going to hold because it's going to be increasing difficult to find work for teh ordinary person that can't be automated. I winced at the tube strikers (RMT, classic communists who got expelled from Labour 20 years ago). They should have taken a trip to Paris and had a look at the French solution to strikes - driver-less trains.

My feeling is that bright people are going to thrive and survive no matter how rubbish the school system is. But the rest are not, and the bright will then have to pay tax to keep the rest, which they'll absolutely hate.

If you're regarded to be attempting to defraud the UK government in a visa application this can result in a ban for travel to the UK for anywhere from one to ten years.

However making a mistake on a visa is not grounds for refusal of another visa. You will have to declare that a previous visa was refused on your next application, however - simply explain this very issue.

A lot of people are having problems this year with the Home Office about names exactly matching passports. It is a very common complaint on http://www.immigrationboards.com/ - and I suggest you also post your question on that forum.

null,false,chirstopher0us,logo,,null,"We should have a good-natured bet on the dominant formation for the first half of the season, because it's going to be a single-striker formation. Consider:

Both Dzeko and Jovetic have been long linked with moves away this summer. There is confirmation that clubs are negotiating for them, and there hasn't been a single leak about particularly wanting to keep either of them. It's also not easy in today's market to find a replacement striker of Dzeko's quality that wouldn't be a big spend. 

We haven't been linked by any rumors with even a single senior striker except for one far-out piece a long time ago speculating about Benzema. If we were in the market to bring in a striker from outside there would be some reports of that by now. 

Letting Dzeko and Jovetic leave with no rumors of replacement suggests a reduced number of strikers in the formation. At the same time, the well-known pursuit of multiple wide players (Sterling, KDB) and multiple CMs (Delph, Pogba) suggests 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, especially when you keep in mind the PL and CL squad size limits of 17 senior players that aren't homegrown. *Even if* we don't declare Zuculini for PL and CL inclusion this year, we still only have 2 of those spots left *even after* Dzeko and Jovetic leave. Coupled with our pursuit of wingers and CMs and fullbacks, there's no room left to bring in a senior striker. 

All of our transfer dealings and rumors, both what is happening and what is not happening, telegraph a move to a single-striker system. 

Furthermore, look at last year. We hung right with Chelsea when we were mostly playing 4-2-3-1 the first half of the season. Strikers got injured and in a pinch we bought Bony. Once the strikers were healthy again, Pellegrini suddenly had enough strikers to use his old 4-2-2-2. Unfortunately, that 4-2-2-2 was a disaster for us and is what we were using when we fell away from Chelsea. At the end of the year we used a 4-3-3 and finished the last few games strongly to consolidate second place.

Non-diamond 4-4-2s just don't work at the top of Europe in 2015. The reason is the strategic importance of controlling midfield space to control possession and distribution. The 4-2-2-2 got run over because it leaves the central midfield too open. Juventus pack the central midfield and sacrifice width in their 4-4-2 diamond, which is a lot different than our 4-4-2. There is not a single top-class European club that uses a non-diamond 4-4-2, and that's for a reason. It concedes too much of the pitch to the opposition.

The Conservatives were elected on a manifesto commitment to hold a vote on relaxing the foxhunting ban. What they have proposed is to bring it into line **with the already more relaxed** Scottish bill, which allows a pack of dogs rather than just 2 to ""flush out"" (i.e. kill) the fox. They said it would be a free vote from their perspective (i.e. no party whip). **So the conservatives have done what they said they would do all along, and what we voted for.** There was already a good chance the vote might not succeed - and I suspect Cameron actually would have been content either way. If he'd won it would make him the hero of the countryside... if he'd lost he probably still would have been praised for trying, and wouldn't have had to deal with the backlash from metropolitan city dwellers that see hunting as archaic. 

The SNP on the other hand made great winds during the General Election about not voting on issues that did not directly relate to Scotland. In the context of the Barnett Formula there aren't many pieces of legislation that don't affect Scotland in some way... but ironically it's hard to think of a bill that has less effect on Scotland than this. In a sense it's precisely the sort of legislation they said they'd stay out of.

So before anyone gets a big semi for Nicola Sturgeon and her gang, I'd remember that **this intervention has nothing to do with foxes**. Like a lot of SNP policy it's about encouraging division within the UK. By voting on this she is essentially demonstrating viscerally the case for EVEL, because it shows that an honor-code system of *""we'll stay out of your business if you stay out of ours""* won't ever work, and that some legislative solution to the West Lothian Question is required. Of course she'll argue that by not giving Scotland everything on a silver platter during the Smith Commission/Scotland Bill that Westminster has made itself fair game... but I think that's probably stretching things a bit. It's one thing not to devolve important economic measures that affect the whole UK, it's another to intervene in what is very much a domestic political issue in England and Wales.

EVEL is win-win for Sturgeon. It will create more headlines in Scotland than it will ever affect legislation in the UK. The perception will be that Westminster is blocking in Scottish MPs.

Furthermore, with the extortionate fees that international students pay, it's been off-setting and holding back the UK's universities from charging domestic and EU students higher fees. For example my course for this academic year charges £4,075 for a domestic/EU student, whereas it would charge an international student £14,754, 3.5x what I'm currently paying; imagine what would happen if all of that investment was pulled? 

A lot of people have also pointed out and said ""why don't they go home and apply for another visa?""; this is part of the problem, whilst the students are based in the UK, it's significantly easier for them to apply for jobs; returning home places a tonne of restrictions on applying for work; not only that but it becomes a major ball ache for employers. 

In addition to that, banning them from working whilst studying also hinders their employment ~~aspects~~ prospects, as they wouldn't have gained ANY work experience whilst in the UK; that's something any employer values above anything else; a recent survey demonstrated that 56% of employers actually favoured work experience over grades; doing internships over the summer is a great time to do this.

Now, I'm going to show you two data points to prove why you're wrong.  In 2008 global emissions rose by 280Mt CO2, which was a 0.9% rise.  In 1990, emissions rose by 240Mt, which was a 1% rise.  Percentage decrease, absolute increase.  Not a reduction. Can you guess why?

Hi, experienced game dev here, working in Cambridge.  The course will not get you there alone. 

This might sound harsh, so deep breath.  I'll try to focus on the games area here as that's my area.

After you've graduated, you'll be competing with a huge European market of graduates all looking to get jobs in games.  It is incredibly difficult to get your foot in the door, especially established studios.  Hard work is what you need and you'll need to put in the hours outside of university to get the advantage over everyone else.

Consider how many studios are out there, and how many universities have games courses now.  More graduates are created from games dev degrees than the industry can accommodate, so only the very top get through.

Get yourself a subscription to Gnomon workhop or Digital Tutors to work on alongside your degree.  
Get onto a hobby team.  
Make games, as soon as possible, and with a bit of skill and a bit of luck, you'll stand head and shoulders above the rest.

Read this excellent summary of how art college can be a bit of a con: https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/dont-go-to-art-school-138c5efd45e9
It's a bit different from the UK, as it's good to have the degree to get past HR, but still worth reading.

Having said all that, I love working in games.  Yes the pay isn't amazing, the hours are shit, but damn it's good fun when it all comes together.

Nope.  Biofuels are both an economic and environmental disaster.  Wind and solar are great but not scalable.  There is no viable plug ang play replacement, and one is not immediately forthcoming.  Emissions are accelerating over the last few decades, despite trying.  Technology is not going to save us.

&gt;  Governments and consumers cannot and will not stop flying, as it's an essential part of the modern world. 

Cutting the number of people who fly is a vastly simpler and easier thing to accomplish than decarbonising the electricity supply, and would be a step in the right direction.

&gt;And while they're using nuclear, they're not burning fossil fuels

China is using both more nuclear and burning more carbon than ever before, so that's a bit of a non starter really.

&gt;  Stop seeing the problems and start seeing the solutions! 

I'm a realist, not a fantasist.  I am suggeting a solution.  Use less energy, be a bit poorer, keep the planet habitable.  This is the only proven method to cut emissions on the global scale.  Continued economic growth probably isn't compatible with large emissions reductions, but then continued economic growth isn't compatible with a world which is 4C warmer either.  The idea that renewables are going to magically decarbonise the world overnight is a fantasy which is not backed up by data nor history.

If you invest your full lump sum now and the markets subsequently go down you may regret putting the whole lump sum in when markets were at the top. That being said, total time in the market is also an important factor. If you invest the whole lump sum in one go and you happen to do this when markets are relatively low (or at least when markets are likely to climb) then you could potentially be better off.

With regards to the tax benefits of investing through an ISA, it's worth getting full up to speed with how distributions from funds are taxed outside of an ISA. For someone on the 40% income tax band, distributions from an equity or mixed asset fund are taxed at the dividend rate of 32.5% for higher rate tax payers, however 10% of this is paid in the fund, leaving a tax liability of 22.5%.

Let's look at the M&amp;G Extra Income fund. This fund has a current yield of 4.24%, so with an investment of £14,000 you should receive a distribution from the fund of around £593. If you have selected to invest in the accumulator share class of the fund, the distribution will be automatically reinvested but you would still be liable to be tax on it. 22.5% of £593 is £133.

The other tax you may be liable to pay from a fund held outside of an ISA is capital gains tax. This is a tax on the gain you have made (the difference between the price you paid for the fund and the price you sold it for). For a higher rate (40%) tax payer, this is taxed at 28%. It is worth baring in mind though that you get an £11,000 capital gains tax per year.

Although I am not commenting on what is best for you to do, you can see that tax liabilities can actually be quite small for investments held outside of an ISA. It is always worth maxing out your ISA allowance as having investments in a tax shelter is always better than not, regardless of how small that benefit may be. What is worth considering though is whether the small tax benefit now outweighs the potential smoothing effect of pound cost averaging.

null,false,sometimesihelp,null,null,null,"It's not quite as straight forward as you are thinking. This post will not compare the relative merit of buying vs. 'invest to rent' but simply on the mechanics of 'invest to rent'.

* Withdrawing from your investment at a rate of 4% is unlikely to preserve the capital sum over long periods of time. The original Trinity study was based on US data and does not hold up qutie so well in most other nations. In the UK a 'safemax' rate of 3.77% was calculated by Wade Pfau [in 2008?] - this assumes perfect foresight, *a 30-year retirement duration*, *no administrative fees*, annual inflation adjustments for withdrawals, and annual rebalancing [70-95% stocks allocation]. His paper is [here](http://www.grips.ac.jp/r-center/wp-content/uploads/10-12_revised.pdf).

* With the capital sum invested in the stock markets it will be subject to volatility. With the Trinity Study derived 4% SWR it is assumed that when the markets are down you will withdraw less. Due to the investment covering a fixed expenditure you would have to cover this shortfall elsewhere (although on the flip side you would sometimes have a surplus).

* It is also possible that the area in which you rent will be subject to above inflation rent increases (e.g. London) or that the area in which you live will gentrify. Equally this could go the other way. Having volatility on both sides of the equation (e.g. stocks down &amp; rental prices up) could be too much risk though.

* If you did want to move where would the costs come from? Assuming this investment is meant to cover living costs you might also need to take these into account depending on how often you plan on moving and/or how you plan on funding them.

Even ignoring the latter points (which is dangerous in and of itself) you are likely to need a higher capital sum because:

1. You need to be able to withdraw from your investment to cover rent for a much longer period than 30 years. This requires a lower withdrawal rate which in turn will require a higher capital sum to match the expected expenditure.
1. The 'safemax' figure given does not take into account ongoing fund fees. Luckily there are low-cost alternatives out there these days but ongoing fees can still run at about 0.25% (e.g. Vanguard LifeStrategy, benefits from automatic rebalancing and no glide-path). Some funds run at 1%+ so it's always worth double checking.

I teach secondary at the minute so I'll give you a run down on classroom life etc. 

Schools are currently being pushed very hard by the government to get results. That means quite a few teachers are stressed out and senior leadership are cracking the whip. That can mean some schools are fracturing whilst others are rallying together. I'm luckily in the latter, but I know plenty in the former. 

We are going through a period of privatising schools. Any school can be privatised and taken over by a business or chain, but the prime candidates are schools that struggle with results. If you work in a privatised school (an academy) then conditions can be different. They're free to set their own hours and holidays and hold teachers to different contracts. Teachers are generally against this but there's not a lot we can do. 

The day-to-day of the job can be rather nice. Kids are generally respectful, dependent on home life. Pretty much all schools have a uniform and they follow a similar curriculum to one another. Members of staff are expected to dress in office wear, though for women that is usually much more relaxed. There's no issues that you see in American schools such as 'Don't be seen drinking!' 'Don't have tattoos!'. Schools here are generally much more understanding of staff being actual people. As long as you don't bad mouth the school in public and don't friend kids on social media you'll be fine.

null,false,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"You make some good points. My main issue with the state pension system is that it's not a fund backed by assets, it's a pay as you go system &amp; not everyone pays the same rates or gets the same rewards. It's also slowly going bankrupt because of our aging population. All the countries with state pensions are suffering from this dilemma &amp; I'm scared. I'm scared because the money I'm putting in I worry won't be worth anything by the time I'm retired (because technically I'm not putting in any money...). There's no security there at all. I would rather pay less taxes &amp; have a larger private pension, at least that is something I can rely on, something I have control over. State pensions are at the whim of the political climate. Perhaps when I'm old it will be the opposite to today &amp; the young majority bring in laws to cut back pensions because their tax rates are too high (they're paying for it). 

But I'm also angry, angry at the fact I have to pay higher taxes to subsidize the increasing pension bill. The pension bill that I feel isn't sustainable &amp; will inevitably have to be cut somehow. 

That's why I'd just like to see the entire system phased out. But doing that in a fair way is difficult too &amp; I don't have the answer to that. You can't just decide to means test it one day, it wouldn't be fair on those that have planned for it (and paid in for decades).  

So I don't know the right way to go about this, but I don't see the current system as sustainable either. Perhaps if the government came up with some long term solution that didn't involve slowly increasing national insurance to keep the fund solvent. If the national insurance scheme had been an asset fund to begin with we wouldn't be in this mess (so a state pension scheme ran like a private one basically).

---

&gt;The [Society of United Irishmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_United_Irishmen) was formed by liberal Presbyterians and Anglicans in [Belfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast) in 1791. It sought reform of the Irish Parliament, [Catholic Emancipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Emancipation) and the repeal of the [Penal Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_Laws_(Ireland\)). By the time the Orange Order was formed, the United Irishmen had become a revolutionary group advocating an independent Irish republic that would ""Unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter"". United Irishmen activity was on the rise, and the government hoped to thwart it by backing the Orange Order from 1796 onward.  Nationalist historians [Thomas A. Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._Jackson) and [John Mitchel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mitchel) argued that the government's goal was to hinder the United Irishmen by fomenting [sectarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism) – it would create disunity and disorder under pretence of ""passion for the Protestant religion"".  Mitchel wrote that the government invented and spread ""fearful rumours of intended massacres of all the Protestant people by the Catholics"".  Historian Richard R Madden wrote that ""efforts were made to infuse into the mind of the Protestant feelings of distrust to his Catholic fellow-countrymen"".  Thomas Knox, British military commander in Ulster, wrote in August 1796 that ""As for the Orangemen, we have rather a difficult card to play...we must to a certain degree uphold them, for with all their licentiousness, on them we must rely for the preservation of our lives and properties should critical times occur"".

All things considered I am neither against nor in favour of regular monthly contributions over lump sum investing. It is totally dependent on the person investing.

Maybe it's just the cynic in me, having worked in the industry a while, but always consider that these types of white paper rarely offer a balanced view. However small their fees are compared to their competitors, Vanguard will make more money from investors who invest larger amounts earlier so there may be some bias.

So hold on a minute.

You're saying he's excellent. But unproven in the system that we seem to play with through balls and creative players behind and less reliance on crosses?

Here's another striker looking solid:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVrr2-xbZWs (YT: Mario Balotelli Amazing Skills 2008 - 2014 HD)Click to play video inline. 

We already have our own Beneteke.

What does he do different in all those clips that Balotelli doesnt? Why did Balotelli fail when he came to Liverpool?

Balotelli -

Strength - check

Wicked shot - check

Ability to shoot from angles - check

Heading ability - check

Threat from set pieces - limited

Passing ability - limited

Running at defences - no (translating to laziness)

Running in behind defences translating to pace ala Sturridge, Sterling or Suarez - no (This has given us one of our most successful seasons in the last decade or so)

Benteke-

Strength - check

Wicked shot - check

Ability to shoot from angles - check

Heading ability - check

Threat from set pieces - check

Passing ability - limited, but better than our current strikers, and not expected to possess this in an advanced level anyway. (One of the worst in Villa or LFC for a striker, however according to this article: http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11677/9868839/christian-benteke-to-liverpool-style-issues-make-it-a-163325m-gamble) 

&gt;However, the caveat in that trite phrase ‘good touch for a big man’ is there for a reason and Benteke has the worst passing accuracy of any regular outfield player at either Villa or Liverpool (39 players in all). Every third pass fails to find its target and that highlights the problem.

Running at defences - check

Running in behind defences translating to pace ala Sturridge, Sterling or Suarez - No.

Great post by you, and I think he isnt going to give us anything that we dont already have. Why would he succeed at LFC? What does he provide in terms of counter attacking play? What does he offer in terms of pace and ability to ghost in behind defenses, which is our style of play and we are builing it further by signing one of the best passers while possessing another one already?

He is an improvement in terms of pressing, set piece ability and running at defences. Good qualities, but not qualitites that will make sure he succeeds here. He's missing the most important one for me.

Unless something drastic happens and we play 2 strikers, or we turn into defence to attack hoofers leaving the midfield alone, he will not cut it.",null,0,null,1436864534,null,0,1436864785,0,ct2qiss,null,t3_3d5vle,null,t1_ct2qiss,null,t1_ct26bni,null,null,null,1437840977,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Second, the article ignores the increase in wages coming in April, too. Here's some fag-packet calculations:  

Shortfall of £42.32 per week by losing housing benefit by the article's own numbers.

Minimum wage goes from £6.50 to £7.20

At 20 hrs/week, 2 people (or 40 hrs/week grand total) that is an increase of £1,456, or £28/week. Implied shortfall of £14/week. With the £50 left over benefit added, claimants are £36/week better off.

At 30 hrs/week, 2 people (or 60 hrs/week grand total) that is an increase of £2,184, or £42/week. Implied shortfall of £0.32/week. With the £50 left over benefit added, claimants are £49.68/week better off.

At 37.5 hrs/week (""full time""), 2 people (or 75 hrs/week grand total) that is an increase of £2,730, or £52.5/week. Top up of £10/week. With the £50 left over benefit added, claimants are £60/week better off.

At the worst case of £94/week shortfall, the numbers are £56/week worse off, £44/week worse off, and £34/week worse off.

Now, my analysis is exceptionally simplistic, because it just offsets the article numbers with the wage increase numbers, taking no other expenditure into account.

If poking holes in *my* work is easy, which I guarantee it is, the article's work is simply laughable.

The article makes the sweeping assumption that everyone hit by the benefits cap will immediately become homeless. I've shown that the increase in wages, added only to the numbers provided by the article, proves that wrong. It also assumes rent won't change.

The poorest are getting poorer by this budget. This article does a piss poor job of illustrating that.

The easiest place to get on the path is probably Edinburgh Quay, which is also the start of it. You then have about 6 miles of good tarmac path to Hermiston but you will want to have a bell - the path goes round a lot of bridges which are blind and have a high crash potential.

After Hermiston the path is no longer tarmac - it's rough road old metal and although it doesn't get muddy it is quite rough and would be unsuitable for a road bike with thin tyres - you could do it (I have) but you'd have to go very slowly.

The Bridge Inn at Ratho is a good stopping point before the path gets smoother but narrower and muddier past the EICA - the world's biggest climbing arena, which has a really nice cafe with a view of the amazing main climbing space (if you haven't seen it I'd recommend it over the Bridge Inn).

Thereafter the path is all pretty much the same - some sections are tar mac, some are road metal and some are muddy. Linlithgow is a good spot for lunch and you'll go through Falkirk too.

As if this automatically means you are the all knowing person on this subject. You clearly arent because your just thrust the label of sexist on someone who was merely making a comparison. The facts he mentioned weren't even sexist for Christs sake. He was just saying that often the most apt people get the job rather than it being a even gender split that isnt as apt. The same goes for women being favoured in certain roles, as does for English footballers at our club. Theyre not going to get in the team just because of their ethnicity if they're not good enough for it.

Also I see that the BBC is only quoting the Government on this story - based on an indirect source.

A lady called Karen took us out for the road ride since there were too many students for just Toby to supervise, she was great too, everything was well paced and well communicated.


I did my DAS training with Nigel at SSM, half a day at a time on weekends spanning a couple of months. Everything was spot on too, never felt either rushed or held back. Nigel even stopped off with me during a lesson so I could get his advice on bikes I was looking at in [SuperbikeFactory](http://www.superbikefactory.co.uk/) in Macc.

Once you account for overtime (men do significantly more), hours worked (men do significantly more and less part-time work), hazard pay (men work in dangerous positions significantly more), position (men are in many higher positions), family (women are more likely to want to spend more time with family), level and type of education (men tend to go into higher paying fields) then it's essentially non-existent.

The only way to close the gap is by either paying women more money for doing less work or forcing them into higher paying jobs at the expense of men to try and make up numbers, both of them are clear cases of gender discrimination (which ironically what many say it will fix).

null,false,BigBaldHaggis,null,null,null,"I starting my adult cycling experience on that canal. As many of said you'll have a wide range of path types to cycle along. 

My tops tips would be:

Hawthorn bushes can be a nightmare, so try to have thick tyres and maybe a puncture resistant liner. 

Wind direction. If you have a headwind, its a long cycle. So think about catching the train to your destination and cycling home or vice versa. 

Bridges, so many bridges with blind turns on the path. Always ring your bell as you approach (others won't) and expect to meet someone coming the other way at the bridge. I nearly landed in the water more than once. 

Highest quality path is at Edinburgh, then surrounding Falkirk Wheel. If you go on further, its good around Kirkintilloch too. Once you are passed Ratho, there isn't really anywhere to stop off until you get to Linlithgow. If budget isn't an issue The Park Bistro is a great place to stop off for food. Has an outdoor area and places for bikes. 

Then you are onto The Falkirk wheel. Plenty of burger and ice cream places there. But you are a good bit from Falkirk town centre so don't expect much in the way of shops (e.g. for spare inner tubes etc)

Big Tunnel before Falkirk. There is a 500 meter tunnel a couple of miles before the Falkirk Wheel. Uneven surface and very wet underfoot. Also a bit dark (there are some lights). I recommend walking through the tunnel. The path is also very thin, so if you meet someone coming the other direction its a tight squeeze. 

Train stations: plenty of points to cut your journey short. Canal almost follows the Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk High train route.

---

&gt;

&gt;__William Pitt the Younger__ (28 May 1759 – 23 January 1806) was a British politician of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He became the youngest [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom) in 1783 at the age of 24. He left office in 1801, but was Prime Minister again from 1804 until his death in 1806. He was also the [Chancellor of the Exchequer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer) throughout his premiership. He is known as ""the Younger"" to distinguish him from his father, [William Pitt the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt,_1st_Earl_of_Chatham), who had previously served as Prime Minister.

&gt;The younger Pitt's prime ministerial tenure, which came during the reign of [George III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom), was dominated by major events in Europe, including the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution) and the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars). Pitt, although often referred to as a [Tory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory_(British_political_party\)), or ""new Tory"", called himself an ""independent [Whig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_(British_political_party\))"" and was generally opposed to the development of a strict partisan political system.

&gt;He is best known for leading Britain in the great wars against France and [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte). Pitt was an outstanding administrator who worked for efficiency and reform, bringing in a new generation of outstanding administrators. He raised taxes to pay for the great war against France and cracked down on radicalism. To meet the threat of Irish support for France, he engineered the [Acts of Union 1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1800) and tried (but failed) to get [Catholic Emancipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Emancipation) as part of the Union. Pitt created the ""new Toryism"", which revived the Tory Party and enabled it to stay in power for the next quarter-century.

I can come up with three possible scenarios:

1. A objects to B's reasonable chastisement of the children (where the harm would not be more than a common assault). A reports B to social services.

2. Social services are already involved. They have put together some sort of acceptable behaviour agreement, which does not permit the use of physical punishment. B breaches this, and A reports him.

3. B has used physical force beyond that which is reasonable, and A has reported him.

Social services don't come and take children away without a very good reason because a) it's really expensive and b) splitting a family that is otherwise ok does more harm than good.

If it's scenario 1, then I suspect that all that will happen is a conversation with all parties to ensure that it's nothing more than that.

If scenario 2 is in play, then it's possible that they could remove the children, but that would be in the context of existing child protection measures, and both A &amp; B will be fully aware of what's going on.

Scenario 3 should involve the police in due course, and may involve B getting nicked, and possibly the police invoking their powers to take the children into police protection if there's grounds to do so, but the level of danger or neglect would have to be extremely high.

&gt;Would the SS remove either the kids or the bad parent (on the other parent's say) or would the kids be removed without the good parent's input?

null,false,crazy_greg,null,null,null,"Ok, this is my experience of distance hiking based on D of E and a few over-night camping hikes and a week-long hike.

Weight: Depends on time of year (winter=more bulky clothing, fuel, etc.) and availability of resources (ie. do you pass shops). I'm going to assume that you're going in summer, because why you'd hike the Pennine Way for the first time in winter is beyond me. I'm also going to assume that you'll need to carry a maximum of 2 days food and water as IIRC the Pennine way passes through many towns and villages.

Based on these assumptions I think 15Kg is a pretty safe bet if you're going for mid-range kit rather than ultra-light stuff. When I did my week long hike my kit weighed in at 12Kg but I knew I could get food and water daily. For D of E gold where we had to carry all out food for the 5 days (but not water thankfully!) it was 17Kg.

Tent: Spend as much money here as you can. Serious, a bad tent is going to be hellish and add weight. My advice is to look for a 1-man tent with a porch for your rucksack. This gives you a little bit of extra room  (as you're not sleeping in the same place as all your kit) and it'll be about a kilo lighter than a 2-man. I've personally always found Terra Nova (or their budget range Wild Country) to be extremely good and would suggest the [Zyphros](http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/wild-country-tents-zephyros-1-tent-71110048?id_colour=98) ( [review](http://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/Gear-Reviews/Search-Results/Tents/Wild-Country-Zephyros-1-2011/)) as a budget option and the [Laser](http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/terra-nova-laser-competition-1-tent-71110071?id_colour=98) ( [review](http://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/Gear-Reviews/Search-Results/Tents/Terra-Nova-Laser-Competition-2009/) ) as a more expensive option.

Rucksack: Does the rucksack that you're currently using have an internal frame (rigid supports along the sides and near your back)? If not then stop using it. If you're carrying more than about 8Kg both your back and the rucksack need more support over long distances than that. Most rucksacks above 50l should come with these supports. The best I can see on the market atm are:
[Osprey Atmos 65](http://www.e-outdoor.co.uk/2661798/products/osprey_atmos_ag_65_backpacking_rucksack.aspx?origin=pla&amp;kwd=&amp;currency=GBP&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjw5pKtBRCqpfPK5qXatWYSJABi5kTx-EVTN3QeT-G8TtAsAcRytAI_KrjWXHUubgRgvoPktxoChcHw_wcB) ( [review](http://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/Gear-Reviews/Search-Results/Rucksacks/Osprey-Atmos-AG-65/) ) I love Osprey Rucksacks. Literally everything about them. A bit pricey though. These two are also good.
[Berghaus Verden](http://www.fieldandtrek.com/berghaus-verden-65-plus-10-rucksack-793003) ( [review](http://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/Gear-Reviews/Search-Results/Rucksacks/Berghaus-Verden-6510-2014/) ) and [Lowe Alpine Cholatse II](http://www.outdoorkit.co.uk/product.php?product_id=17212&amp;utm_source=froogle&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=froogle&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjw5pKtBRCqpfPK5qXatWYSJABi5kTxVbZ7QBlzKumihOosSfdckUWle_YihGkC-hyEYJX-kxoCQFvw_wcB) ( [review](http://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/Gear-Reviews/Search-Results/Rucksacks/Lowe-Alpine-Cholatse-II-5565-2014/)).

Additional kit: You kit the nail on the head there. The ability to have hot food is a huge morale boost and increases the amount of food you can carry (as you can heat dried foods). I rate it as essential. The best budget option here is the good old Trangia. It's stable, it comes with everything it needs, it cooks meths and it's near idiot proof. The only disadvantage is that it's slow as hell for any cooking. Since doing D of E I've upgraded to gas with the [Primus Spider](http://www.blacks.co.uk/activities/104585-primus-express-spider-stove.html/509810/?istCompanyId=d92b362f-ac8a-4a8a-87ca-c56eafad7955&amp;istItemId=raxlaqwxq&amp;istBid=tztx&amp;mkwid=syWJOk3HD_dc&amp;pcrid=76366488862&amp;pkw=&amp;pmt=&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjw5pKtBRCqpfPK5qXatWYSJABi5kTxO5U1hBCMqDO_IWoOph8njfRsiCzrlNjHO3o6UxBtShoClHzw_wcB) ( [review](http://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/Gear-Reviews/Search-Results/Camping-stoves/Primus-Express-Spider-2011/) ) cooker which pretty good. I kind of wish I'd bought the [MSR windpro](https://www.theoutdoorshop.com/windpro-2.html?gclid=CjwKEAjw5pKtBRCqpfPK5qXatWYSJABi5kTx70h7LUGtS0BndFdnKTTzNhwmOGZdXJVa412ktKMWcRoCuOTw_wcB) ( [review](http://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/Gear-Reviews/Search-Results/Camping-stoves/MSR-Windpro/) ) and I suggest if your budget allows it that you do too.
I'm going to talk a little bit about food here as well, so feel free to skip this if you know it already. You need a LOT of calories if you're walking 20 miles a day with ~15Kg of weight. The best way to do this is witha  combination of carbs, sugars and protein. 

You need carbs at the start and during the day to keep you going, sugar you always need, protein you need from later in the day. Best carb IMO for breakfast: oats. You pack them dry boil them in water and hey-presto you've got a hot filling breakfast. I take a sugar (jam, honey, etc) to keep up the sugar level. Lunch is usually pita bread for me as it keeps well and doesn't get wrecked by being crammed into a rucksack. Add protein (tuna, cured sausage (perreroni)) followed by sugar (see:breakfast). Top Tip! If you can find tuna in foil packets rather than tins you have reached god mode! Protein that keeps well and is low weight! Dinner is usually whatever I can be bothered with, for me this is usually instant soup with instant noodles or instant soup with cous-cous. Both are dry packing, quick cooking carbs. Add protein to this. NB. If you can find Freeze dried meat in the UK (not east) then it tastes like feet but is the best protein/weight thing out there, plus it keeps forever. IMO the best snack for hiking is and always will be GORN (Good Ol' Rasins and Nuts), but hard boiled sweets are good for keeping up the sugar levels. Kendal mint cake is an amazing morale booster as well.

Water. You need a lot of water when hiking as well and aim to drink a minimum of 2 litres a day. For this reason I usually carry 3l of water (3Kg of weight). This stuff is important, if you find it hard to drink that much plain water then powdered electrolyte drinks are a good plan, they bring protein and salts back into your body and taste different to water to keep you drinking.

Let me know if you have any other questions, I find the [REI page](http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/camping.html#tab_4) has a lot of useful advice for hikers and campers.

Didn't think of that - thanks.

&gt; I have not met a single student who doesn't appreciate/think they are heavily in debt and I have met many who think nothing of maxing out an overdraft etc as 'they are already in a shit load of debt anyway'.

Really? My experience is the complete opposite. If I went through my entire peers list I don't know of any who would bother to assess their student loan debt when they were considering how much debt they are in. I certainly don't!

I completely agree though that there is an issue here with debt seeming ""normal"" - again, if I went through everyone I know (including myself) most people at one time had a maxed overdraft and probably a cerdit card too. I strongly disagree that this has anything to do with student debt, however, and I don't think being the recipient of a student loan encourages people to take on large overdrafts. 

Honestly, I think the problem is that as a young student you just have no context of the kind of expenses actual living entails. I went into Uni with the mindset that ""having a full overdraft is bad"" but after a couple months of living on £70 a week it was really easy to rationalise ""if I earn £20,000 a year that's 4 times my income now so I can pay off a £1500 overdraft like it's no thing.""

It may cost the immigrant a little more, but if they are getting a skilled job then spending a couple of thousand pounds for immigration is a drop in the ocean compared to the future higher earnings they would be getting.

The article doesn't go into full details, but the only change I can see is they are removing a path to settlement from a student visa, so when it expires, you leave and either get a job work visa and return or don't come back.

If a student is legitimate, n the big scheme of things it's a minor hassle for a better job.
If the student is not really a student, but is planning on coming here, and minicabbing or whatever else instead of studying, it stops them then getting ILR and ultimately citizenship, through the various paths currently possible. If a student has chosen a subject with no work demand,it also stops them staying on in an unrelated low paid job. In this respect it encourages study where the demand for labour is higher.

Clearly it's anecdotal evidence on both our parts and it'd be a hard one to prove either way. I don't think student loan is the entire issue but it's part of the culture of debt. Banks being eager to give credit cards and ever increasing ""free"" overdrafts to students obviously play a major part in the debt culture as well. However the current system does expect students to survive on an incredibly small income with the casual assumption that parents will continue to provide accommodation out of term time and subside living costs as you study. This plays a major part in people wanting/needing to use there overdraft facilities etc.

In all seriousness my maintenance loan was around £3000 a year (£3145 rings a bell but can't actually remember). I challenge any one to pay rent, bills and eat on £3000 a year. Sure my parents stepped in and helped me out but at 18years of age it really wasn't their responsibility to do so. I'm sure theres plenty of people who'd say get a job and to an extent they are right as well but jobs in student towns, or at least where I studied where very hard to come by and my course at least had around 20hours of tutored time with the official guideline being an hour before and an hour after wards of personal work being required, thats a 60hour week of university work (I'm well aware none actually put those hours in but that was the expectation by the university).

There is no one point where time only splits into two lines, it would be a huge web of infinite divergent universes branching off everywhere.

But for A) You could time lock the past, so that everything involving the Doctor prior to the fracture. Or tine lock the fork itself so that no tine travelling can enter it and meddle with the events, and therefore the person is always destined to take the path of time that they are meant to.

B) The people on one side of the fork would be locked into their one time line unless they either went sideways in time or back to the fork and into the other dimension. Again, some sort of time lock around the event that created the fork would ensure that events always played as they were meant to for the people who arrive there.

C) Doing any action at all would create a divergent universe. But if you wanted to make a major difference then killing any major world leader at critical times most likely result in a different enough universe. That is, if you are looking for one event as a point of divergence. 
Pete's World, for instance, is a parallel universe rather than a divergent one. There is no single point in which history changed, history has played out differently the entire time.

I hope these ideas helped and I hope that you don't take them and say you came up with then.

I got lumped with writing reports that should have been done at ward level by Senior managers but I got lumped with it amongst other things.

'A friend' once ate 5g of shrooms (cubensis b+) for their first time at a mates student room with 2 of his mates, they decided it was far too warm and cramped to stay over so they all went to go home at about 8pm (an your and a half after ingesting them), it was a half hour walk from the train station, off they set...

During the walk on a Saturday night my friend reported the experience ""being like a game"" seeing the same 10 or so people over and over again, you know like in GTA 3 or the older oblivion games where they recycle the same npc models over and over? Well like that but with real people.

My mates say once on the train, he sat himself down and when the ticket collector person approached him, he just stared blankly at them for a few minutes while they were trying to either check his ticket or get train fare out of him. Eventually my other mates went over to him, helped him get his wallet out and pay for the fare. 

After they got back to our hometown, they walked the half your or so back to where everyone approximately lived, so this is about half 9 by now and they got called asking if they wanted to go to pre drinks at a mates house. It was on the way into the centre of all the estates and suburbs etc so they went.

Once in there, it was clear the guy who ate all the shrooms was completely and utterly catatonic but on his feet, unable to speak or hear for the most part, in a zombie like state.

After about 10 minutes of everyone talking, he started walking into the kitchen, I heard someone went in and cleared the kitchen knives off of the side in the knife block and into a draw.

He walked up to the counter and downed a large  bottle of someone's Orangina they were going to use for a mixer, then mumbled he was going to bed and started walking upstairs (despite not knowing the owner of the house or ever being there before) 

This continued in various parts of the town, including just outside the a&amp;e department where my mates tried to get him to go in and get seen by a doctor for half an hour, before he eventually managed to communicate by typing out texts and showing it to them to read. Before finally  they got him in a taxi home and he slept it off.",null,0,null,1436871016,null,0,false,0,ct2s3i8,null,t3_3d8mlw,null,t1_ct2s3i8,null,t3_3d8mlw,null,null,null,1437841388,null,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2,null

I 100% disagree and think it's incredibly sad that anyone should think so. The student loan culture is a relatively modern phoneme. The government likes the claim it is impossible for education to be free but some how it existed up until 1997. Whether you believe education should be free or based on loans is irrelevant to me. At 18years of age, in this country, you are considered legally an adult and your parents no longer have any legal obligation or responsibility for you or your actions. It is therefore ridiculous that there income is taken into account. It is yet more ridiculous that it is house hold income not even parents income that is taken into account. I have met people who's step parents have been the main wage earner who has then refused to contribute to the step child's university fund, as is their right, leaving the student with minimal loan and no other source of income. In one case purely anecdotally I know of someone dropping out of university just because of the cost from this exact circumstance.

I'm well aware of the way to be exempt from you're parents income, that would require you're parents making you homeless and cutting you off totally which is a whole further degree of seriousness to being unwilling to fund university. This would become even more problematic if Camerons plan to refuse benefits to under 25 comes into play. It's all well and good saying in education or work not benefits for young people but this would make it impossible to be independent of your parents for 3 years short of living on the streets.

&gt; If that rule was dropped a great many middle class parents may well make their kids take out the loans anyway

And rightly so, why should your parents be funding you as an adult? Its nice that they are willing but it shouldn't be expected of them.

No they aren't. Labour introduced the fox hunting ban. They are now keen to uphold their own legislation AND score a hit against the conservatives. There is no reason why labour would support this bill. It also makes sense if you look at where their voters come from - which is [mostly metropolitan areas](http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ukelection2015_mapviews.jpg), vs the strong showing the conservatives have in the English countryside.

The SNP on the other hand have no interest in fox hunting in England. It has no impact on Scotland. There is no way this can benefit or harm the Scots. They have no UK wing of the party (unlike Labour and the Conservatives) on whom to support... so their opposition is based on scoring a hit against the conseravatives. Why?

* 1) The SNP were elected on a ticket of ""We will be a voice for Scotland""... except thats kinda hard, because with 56 MPs in a Conservative majority government it doesn't really matter what they do - they can be bypassed. This is going to be one of very few pieces of legislation that come down to a free vote where enough Tories are likely to dissent to make opposition viable. It's going to get the SNP a lot of headlines when actually before Saturday they'd gone quite for a few weeks after the initial post election hype.

* 2) By blocking the fox hunting ban it's going to cause a fury in the English countryside... a lot of those voters were precisely the same people who didn't ""love"" tory policy, but voted conservative instead of UKIP/LD and Labour because they were terrified of divisive Scottish nationalists forming a coalition with Labour. It's going to bump the English perception of EVEL from ""would be good"" to ""WE MUST FUCKING HAVE THIS NOW!!""... which is great for the SNP, because as I said above; EVEL will create more headlines in Scotland than it will ever influence legislation. 

* 3) It will sow discord between the middle English voters that determine Westminster elections and Scots. Which is good for the SNP, because lets not forget - their interest is not in prohibiting archaic traditions in England - no, their interest is in simply separating from England.

Absolutely agree with this. The fact that anyone can open a student account and just be gifted a £1500 overdraft is pretty silly. 

&gt;In all seriousness my maintenance loan was around £3000 a year (£3145 rings a bell but can't actually remember). I challenge any one to pay rent, bills and eat on £3000 a year.

I think I got about £3000 a year + £1000 a year or so as a grant. I did work, but only 5 hours on a Saturday at min wage, which only contributed to ~£100 a month - I actually did manage to get through the year reasonably comfortably... until summer rolled round and I still had to pay rent which would have been impossible without an overdraft.

I'd much much rather have the option of taking a bigger maintenance loan (say £4000 or something) which would mean I wouldn't need to have an overdraft - like I say, the maint. loan doesn't affect me in practical terms I don't think, but the overdraft absolutely does (and is still with me at 26).

So move out, become ""independent"" and go for it yourself. There are ways around having your parents' income measured: live independently for 3 years and you're no longer regarded as dependent on them. Is 3 years too long? Perhaps it is. Too short and people abuse it by ""moving out"" for a minimal period of time to claim this.

Also, moving out doesn't mean moving onto the streets.

&gt;In one case purely anecdotally I know of someone dropping out of university just because of the cost from this exact circumstance.

[Access to Learning Funds](http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/money/student-finance/access-to-learning-funds) exist for that purpose and are at the discretion of the University you attend, not the government.

- - -

Fundamentally the idea is that the State isn't responsible for your tertiary education where your family is able to take responsibility. The loans exist to help those poor students whose families simply can't support them even if they wanted to.

The circumstances you describe where a middle class student is forced to rely on these loans to the same extent that a poor student is are exceptionally rare circumstances and very difficult to police.

You say ""rightly so"", but these loans are given under strict circumstances and are very generous in their terms: they're not just any other bank loan, they're a government initiative to financially support those who need it. The loans aren't for the kids of well-off parents who either have this idea that they deserve to be independent now or whose parents have this idea that junior should be taking responsibility for his own money issues now.

The government isn't the font from which all solutions flow. A loan system intended to help those families *unable to afford* to send their kids to University rightly should not be opened up to middle class families who simply *don't want to* support their kids.",null,0,null,1436871935,null,0,false,0,ct2sc26,null,t3_3d0f92,null,t1_ct2sc26,null,t1_ct2s5dt,null,null,null,1437841502,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I'd advise doing some more research, and finding organisations that recruit overseas to fill permanent places, because this does happen. The biggest demand for teachers is in London, because of the cost of living vs. the only slightly-higher salary, but there'll be other options across England. (If you're male, all the better, there's a *dire* shortage of male primary teachers!)

In this situation, you'd be treated pretty much like any NQT (newly-qualified teacher), assigned your own class from day one but with some additional support from senior staff. You'd be expected to be fully up-to-speed with the English curriclum, the normal systems for assessment and record-keeping, the mandated formal tests (SATs), and so on. The up-side of this is that you'd be earning a full (and reliable) teacher's salary, covering a full 12-month period or ongoing beyond that.

Not enough specialist coaches and expertise was his point, and that chimes with the stories you'd hear about Redknapp's old-fashioned training methods and also the stories of Sherwood sitting in the canteen all day, leading players to nickname it ""The Pub"".

So the vision was there, but I think in Poch, Levy has finally found someone with the passion for training and player development that can make a facility like that worthwhile. Maybe Levy thought AVB would be that man, but turns out he wasn't. Without that mentality, all the training complex is is a fancy building. I think that's the point I'm making about Levy's thinking crystallizing under Pochettino -- I don't think Levy has ever lacked the vision, it's just he's never been quite clear on how to execute it.

Again, let's all try and remember this positivity after that 0-1 home defeat by Stoke.

Move out to where? Private rents typically require approx 2 months rent up front as deposit and evidence that you can pay rent there after. So you're saying post school some how have somewhere in the region of £1000 in hand and a job capable of paying rent. That is a very tough ask in the modern climate. It is not a realistic expectation.

You keep saying kids you fail to appreciate you are not talking about children but adults. Legally every one over 18 is an adult. It would appear you have grown up with the privilege of loving parents, fortunately so have I, but you do not seem able to comprehend that some parents simply don't care about their children. It is not the parents who suffer if they decide not to fund university but the student. The system is meant to be there so that any one who wants to study at university has the finical option to do so. A principle that I fully support. As it stands a person from a poor background with no parental support can afford university but some one from a middle or upperclass back ground with no parental support cannot.

Money creation has been outsourced to the private banking sector because, supposedly, the banking sector should be more risk-averse than the government when it comes to making loans.

null,false,Roshambo2110,null,null,null,"IMO, the game has changed; until only a few seasons ago, a benefactor could buy a club like a Man City or a Blackburn, throw a few hundred million at it and see instant success on the pitch.

However, as the money coming into the game has gone through the roof in the last 2 PL TV deals and the increased finance from abroad, it has become more than just player + wages. If you look at Manchester City, they have that but they also have the facilities, the stadium and the international presence. To compete with that 'overnight' (and I mean that in terms of a few seasons or so...) you're looking at the best part of, if not more than, £1BN. In reality, there's only a few people or companies on the planet with that sort of clout.

So, what does one do? You try and compete on the back-end, building the infrastructure of the club and brand, and work towards building the additional revenue streams and consistency off the pitch which will hopefully build and compliment that on the pitch.

In these terms, the club is doing what it should be, IMO; the training complex appears to be incredibly well regarded by the number of high-profile visitors we've had, and the players, and the NFL deal and new stadium take it that next step further.

Instant gratification is really a subjective term, but I totally understand what you mean. I was a season ticket holder under the Francis, Graham and Hoddle eras so for me, what we have now in terms of profile and expectation is beyond my wildest expectations. Whether we sign 'X' player for £30m is incredibly short-sighted; it makes far more sense from a point of view of squad harmony and ethos, finance and because the fans love to 'grow' a player to create rather than purchase a 'superstar' to buy players and make them more than they were when they came - Bale, Modric, Carrick. Fans are so quick to look for a quick answer but it always mystifies me; so many of our 'big 
'signings', even in relative terms, have been terrible mis-fires. From Dumitrescu to Rebrov to Pavulychenko (although that might be slightly harsh) to recent flops like Paulinho, Soldado et al. It's when we - and all clubs - are smart in the market that we operate best. Obviously you want 'big' players but as I said in the other thread, once you factor in wages, someone like Schneiderlin works out at £50m and that just isn't realistic for a club like ours, nor is it prudent.

Anyway apologies for rambling! Hope that makes sense - I'm typing on my phone",null,0,null,1436873256,null,0,false,0,ct2splf,null,t3_3d8mzt,null,t1_ct2splf,null,t3_3d8mzt,null,null,null,1437841678,null,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8,null

Individualism- the individual is the primary unit of focus and is valued about society/groups.

Collectivism- the individual is viewed only in context of different groups such as race, class etc. and is subordinate to the needs of society.

On your second point yes, this form of absolute individualism would be weaker and probably wouldn't have advanced the Human race. Civilisation requires a certain amount of collectivism to succeed, indeed it is entirely dependent upon it. Societies are easier to organise based upon collectivist principles and are stronger for it but they are also more vulnerable to abuse. Collectivism allows for a great deal of good or bad to be accomplished by the group, like a fire it can warm or burn(please forgive the poetry). Individualism is a lot less powerful in this regard.

I've no doubt the vast majority of the OO/loyalists are decent people but it doesn't matter how the OO try and paint it, it's a sectarian organisation that thrives on triumphalism with links to loyalist paramilitaries who either encourage or stand aside and accept the shit we end up seeing year on year.

There is nothing anyone can do or say to justify having effigies of politicians of any persuasion, flags etc on bonfires, it's triumphalism and anti-Catholic, so one should not be surprised when residents of particular areas don't want it on their doorstep. They've had this shoved down their throats for decades and only over the last decade or two are they starting to see move back to some sort of balance. There is still a lot of acceptance of this behaviour that I personally think should be rejected even every day stuff -  the OO arches in Lisburn for example or ridiculous amounts of flags put up in mixed areas or outside Catholic schools or churches. How do you think this makes people feel? Do you think this helps the cause or just perpetuates the conflicting issues?

Personally, if it was just wooden structures located in a safe place that doesn't shove it in the face of others, where people could have a few drinks, enjoy the festivity and camaraderie, then I'd be all for it. Or marches were routed where there is public support, or marches abided by lawful decisions and didn't break them just to wind people up. That's not what happens. We in NI should not be trusted with the freedom to march the Queen's highway or have bonfires because we generally can't behave and we can't do it without pissing massive amounts of people off, hurting each other, the Police or even ourselves.

Listen we've come a long way. I've no desire for a united Ireland and I'd bet most Catholics don't either. My probably controversial view is that we should ban all murals, flags, marches, demonstrations anything that gets people riled up on this issue, enforce mixed schools, bring in politicians who represent us on important stuff not flags and marches and see where that leaves us in 50 years.

Of this amount, 23% voted Yes. So you could extrapolate that to conclude that roughly 7% of voters (roughly 10-15% of No voters) were not Scottish.  Expats were excluded too, even if they only lived in England, diminishing the Yes side.

Frankly, I think that due to the civic  nationalism platform of the referendum, it failed rather than the people chose. Public opinion would show that the majority of Scots *do* want independence, but lost out due to the system.

Edit: why the down votes? Because I show the figures that hurt the pro-UK narrative? Yes yes silence the rowdy Scots so they know their place... sad.

null,false,IxionS3,null,null,null,"It's about inheritance tax (IHT).  When someone dies their estate (i.e. everything they own) is valued.  If it amounts to more than the IHT allowance, currently £325,000, then IHT is due.

Gifts that the deceased made up to 7 years before their death are added in to the estate when valuing it for IHT purposes, with some exceptions.

If the total of non-exempt gifts is less than the IHT allowance then the recipients do not have to pay any of the gift in tax.  If the total of gifts exceeds the allowance then the most recent gifts will be taxable, and the recipients of those gifts may have to pay the tax.

So under current rules if your nan has only given away a total of £150,000 in the last seven years then there is no possibility of you being asked to pay tax on your gift.

Grand Designs, Location Location etc all these shows show you the awesome and unproblematic side of owning and building, however what happens with those people and families a few years down the road is never shown. How many people and families are creating their own financial ruin, spanning across the whole family, fincancially scared for life. (At grand designs you sometimes see that the projects go WAY beyond budget but its direct or eventual impact is of course not interesting for the show..) many of those people possibly lose their house to banks, personal bankruptcy foreclosure etc). 

Landlords are happy if they have a good paying tenant - everytime they are changing their tenants they are losing money so its in their best interest to keep them there as long as possible. Yes in London that will probably mean yearly rent increase, but countercalculating inflation and a possible salary increase per year will decrease the impact of this a bit. Yes you can get unlucky with a landlord, but then move on to the next - you are flexible...


i am 34 and thought about buying recently... its the thing to do, thats what everyone says, everyone does, parents did, i SHOULD do. after reading alot and educating myself about properties as investment, property market and mortgage market, its clear to me that this is IMO a stupid idea. now i will save as much as i can, and in 15 / 20 years see where i am. Only if am very confident in the stability of the family circumstances (jobs, kids, schools all set up with no potential changes approaching) then i am willing to buy a property, and by that time hopefully can pay most of with with my savings. (ideal scenario, buying property with all money down...). so yeah, enjoy your life, move around if you want, save as much as you can. maybe you meet someone special that already owns a house who knows:), in that case your savings will go straight into your retirement plans which should always be in the back of your head...

Last summer I was terribly worried about or defence and goalkeeping for the forthcoming season. We saw departures of Lovren (who at the time looked quality), Chambers (who featured in 50% of our games) and Boruc (a character sure, but no one can argue his shot-stopping abilities). With Koeman at the helm, and a tidy bank from our transfers, I was sure we would sort it. And that we did. Forester, Toby  and Bertrand all had HUGE roles to play in our success last season. Sure, Fonte is our mainstay, but these players contributed tremendously to our success last season. Keeping Schneiderlin and Wanyama were just as critical. 

Have we replaced the quality of those departed from this incredible back half? No. Have we added needed depth for our Europe campaign? Maybe... depending on who else comes in. In my opinion, we need two quality CBs - one of at least Toby's standard and another who's versatility could cover in fullback for injuries. Yoshida proved his quality last season, but this season we have to trudge through multiple games a week; surely, this will increase our injury list. 

The signings of yet are a bit uninspiring. But, I trust our board, and I love the stability and model of the club. Koeman of all will understand what we need.

&gt;Possibly selling my EVGA GTX 590, 99% working order apart from the fan doesn't spin.

This is due to me putting on new thermal paste, once I put it back together I noticed the fan wasn't spinning after seeing the desktop on screen.

Could be a cheap fix, worth anything?

Yes and no. The government is issuing new gilts all the time (we have an ongoing budget deficit), so the net effect was that new money was created and spent by the government. That the market was used as a middle man is somewhat immaterial to the end net result.

Also, the coupon payments that the government pays to the BoE get sent back to the gov, so they get free debt.

Sakho and sturridge i would say in terms of pure skill and other values they bring to the pitch are better but they just are injured to much. Im hoping for a better season for them where they atleast get to play for the majority of the games.

I dont get why everyone rates lallana so high?
Hes got potential, but he holds up the ball alot and slows down our game in attack. Sure it might be easy to coach him in other ways, but as far as i see it hes not close to being our best player.

1) Some student halls might be more amenable to having a tenant just for a semester, but if not you'll likely be able to find somewhere on spareroom.co.uk

2) I reckon you'll be looking to spend 300-400 on rent if you're in private accommodation, and most students probably spend 50-100 quid a week, depending on how often they go out etc.

3) Everyone I know uses www.thetrainline.com for tickets. It might be the official site, I'm not sure though. Typically people book in advance for a longer journey, like London to Birmingham. If you book well in advance you can get a London-&gt;Birmingham ticket for like six quid, and if you book the ticket five minutes before the journey it's something silly like eighty quid. If you just wanted train tickets for a very short journey like Selly Oak to New Street though, for example, you'd just buy your ticket from the machine at the station. It's something like £2.50 return.

Edit: Apparently I'm 0 for 2 today, see /u/aberstan's post for why thetrainline isn't such a great idea.

What they were looking for was a big built up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure.""

According to the historian Sonke Neitzel, ""it is difficult to find any evidence in German documents that the destruction of Dresden had any consequences worth mentioning on the Eastern Front. The industrial plants of Dresden played no significant role in German industry at this stage in the war"".

Wing Commander H. R. Allen said, ""The final phase of Bomber Command's operations was far and away the worst... the use of minimum force in war was to become a mockery and the outrages perpetrated by the bombers will be remembered a thousand years hence"".

In other words, it's a job that, if you have it, you can't afford to not take it seriously. Do it right, you keep your job. Do it wrong, you lose your job, your licence, and possibly face fines and/or jail.

Zero hours or not, it's a serious job that anyone adequately trained will take seriously. If not adequately trained and not taking it seriously, there's tough lessons to be learned.

Also laughing at some fucking twat I went school with being all high and mighty on Facebook. The man is full of rage.

&gt; tell me you funniest, most embarrassing, drunken anecdote, maybe something ""your friend"" did once to cheer me up!

I've got two.

I used to brew alcohol, I was not good at this and once forged something that was green. Seriously, it was evil. I kept it on my window-ledge to admire my ability to create nerve toxin easily. I called it ""The Death"" and told everyone to not drink under the idea that you might die.

Que a house party where someone drank it... and proceeded to throw up outside my house, whilst holding his hands to his mouth, straight down his shirt and onto his mrs who was helping him walk at that point.

I just stood there pissing myself with laughter... got the jetwash and got him with it.

---

Second one;

At a house party when I was on leave from the Army. Two guys there are a little more crazy and weird than the rest...

I woke up in the morning to find a room decimated, a grand piano dismantelled and reassembled into a a giant pentagram surrounded by toilet paper (un-used) and a dildo spinning in the centre of it all. The two dudes in question? One passed out on the window-ledge and the other one sat in his underwear proped up against the wall.

I just stood there for a minute wondering ""How the fuck is this mess going ... not my house, cigarette"", walked outside, had a smoke and caffeine.

It's a subtle and brief encounter which assures mum and baby are happy.

It's possible it could have happened the way she said, but not likely.  The fb post was, though lengthy, quite vague.  

&gt;I decided to find a quiet spot out of the way of others and feed her discreetly.

So, where then?  Where was quiet spot?  Most places in a Primark are usually easy to describe especially by persons who do more shopping than the less fairer sex.  Was it a chair by the escalators?

Hey! First off, welcome to Birmingham and congratulations on your acceptance from Aston. :) I actually worked as an international student ambassador for Aston Uni last year, hell, maybe we've even spoken with each other before. Did the university not give you a contact person in the international office to ask questions to? It should be absolutely no problem for you to ask to speak to a current student, they will happily set up a line of contact so all of your questions can be answered. Otherwise, you can also sign up for the pre-arrival e-mentoring system where they pair you up with current students. I think it's better you go through the official route, but I'll try to answer some of the questions here.

&gt; 1) The university doesn't offer accommodation to students who attend the college just for a semester. How do I find cheap accommodation nearby? I tried looking for accommodation, but most of the people are looking for long term tenants. Is there any hostel facility available for student? If yes where can I find it?

Have you looked into private student housing? Granted, I do not know if any of them offer one semester terms, but they should be your first station if you haven't checked them out yet. The Heights, Pentworks, Cosmopolitan and Canalside are all student accommodations that are near to the university (the first three are within 5 minutes walking distance) that are in the same price range as Aston's campus accommodation. Most second and final year students live there, as campus accommodation is mainly freshers. Other options are Curzon Gate, Londonderry House and Orion (I think that's what it's called, it's above the sainsbury's by New St and Mailbox). I cannot speak for the prices and quality of housing there though.

If the above options fail, I'd search for some Facebook groups to find people who are either subletting their private accommodation or looking for a housemate. There are probably specific ones for that (maybe University of Birmingham has a bigger community), otherwise you could try posting in the Aston Freshers 2015/16 group - though it is still very small.

&gt; 2) Whats the average cost of living for students in Birmingham? I have been told that it varies from 600 to around 1200 pounds a month. How much do you actually need?

I believe I paid appx. 130 per week for my campus accommodation, but that will obviously depend on where you decide to stay. I can say that campus accommodation is one of the more expensive options. In terms of other living costs (self-catered food, drinks usually twice a week and then a night out once a week plus whatever events I feel like going to) I lived very comfortably on appx. £400 a month. This of course varies greatly on your own habits. I like to spend a lot on food and drinks since I consume a lot of both and also enjoy cooking, so my weekly budget for food was around £35-45, but I have many friends who are happy with only spending £15 or £20 at Aldi. If you really want more info on this, I can ask my friends how much they spend monthly and get back to you. 

&gt; 3) How does the British transportation system actually work? There were multiple websites for train tickets offering the same tickets at different prices. Is there any official british railway website?

You can buy your train tickets for any line from any website, generally speaking. So you can buy tickets for Virgin trains to London from the Cross Country website and vice versa. If that's still confusing, you can always book through the National Rail website. You should never be paying booking fees, but some pages charge them, so avoid those. Also, be wary that when taking local busses, you do not receive any change when buying tickets on busses, so carry exact change. Most supermarkets will switch bills for coins if you ask kindly enough. 

&gt; 4) How hard is it to get a car for foreign nationals?

Can't answer to that, sorry! But if you live close to campus, you'll also be in the city centre. I've never found a need for a car unless I would have wanted to visit the countryside to hike or something. There is so much to do within walking distance and you can get super cheap train and coach tickets if you look closely.

Last but not least, enjoy your time at Aston and in Birmingham! I'm sure you'll have a great time - it's a superb university and a beautiful city. If you want to keep up to date with the happenings and find some cool restaurants and bars to visit, definitely consider following these three blogs/pages:

&gt;**About**

This is a system previously used in game development and hackintosh experimentation. It has now been replaced so this is no longer needed. 

* Motherboard - [Gigabyte Z68AP-D3](http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4015&amp;dl=#ov) (socket 1155 LGA)
* CPU - [Intel Core i7 2600K](http://ark.intel.com/products/52214/Intel-Core-i7-2600K-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-3_80-GHz)
* RAM - 8GB (2 x 4GB) 1333Mhz (unbranded)
* Video Card - [MSI Twin Frozr GTX 580](http://uk.msi.com/product/vga/N580GTX_Twin_Frozr_IIOC.html#hero-overview)
* HDD - Western Digital 500GB
* PSU - Coolermaster GX 750W

**Condition**

Everything but the case is in brilliant condition. The case has some sticky residue from where company stickers were and one of the DVD slot covers is missing as it used to have 2 DVD drives.

**Trade**

At this time I'm looking to trade the entire system. If no trade is accepted then I'll be looking to split the system.

For trade I'd consider: PS4, XB1, iPhone, iPad, Galaxy S6, Nvidia GTX 970

I would prefer collection for the system. I'm located in Harrow.

The English Parliament itself could just be Westminister, just get rid of all the Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish MPs, then create a new UK parliament elsewhere, with something like 50 or so members, or less even. Then devolve the big UK-wide issues like defence and economy to it. Dave can decide if he wants to to be First Minister of England in Westminister, or Prime Minister of the UK in the new parliament.

What is necessary is a separation between England and the UK politically. The fact that their isn't one means that there is very few English only issues, anything which changes the amount of money spent on something has a knock on effect on the budgets outside England, due to the Barnett formula. Simply stopping non-English MPs from voting on issues like that is just depriving them of having any say on the budgets within their own countries.

The other option is to give full tax raising powers to the counties outside England and devo max, although even then Wales and Northern Ireland will require some form of grant money as their economies on their own are not self sustainable, and they'll want a say in that money.",null,0,null,1436880003,null,0,1436880229,0,ct2v930,null,t3_3d8ikc,null,t1_ct2v930,null,t1_ct2tszv,null,null,null,1437843251,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

**Drinks:**

[Bittles!](http://visit-belfast.com/things-to-do/member/bittles-bar) Tiny city centre bar, family owned, has a weird smell, loads of Belfast-centric art on the wall and an AMAZING selection of beers and whiskies. The owners and the drinkers are real characters. Class fun and every bit 'the real deal'.

[Lavery's!](http://www.laverysbelfast.com/) I haven't been here in ages but it's a Belfast institution. Three floors of fun, large beer garden out the back (and on the roof) and has a new craft beer type bar attached to it as well. And an off license.

[Bert's!](http://www.themerchanthotel.com/bars-restaurants/berts-jazz-bar/) An art-deco styled jazz bar owned by the Merchant Hotel. There is a great cocktail lounge in the main hotel but but do yourself a favour and hit Bert's, although do it midweek. The cocktails are as good if not better, excellent bar snacks, generally quiet Monday - Thursday and there's live jazz which is usually pretty decent. 

**Snacks:**

[Dina Dina!](http://dinadina.co.uk/) Relatively new lunch joint that does Italian piadinas/flatbreads. Freshly made that day, always great, awesome tiramisu as well to sit in or take away if it's a nice day.

[Cuban Sandwich Factory!](https://www.facebook.com/CubanSandwichFactoryBelfast) Operates out of St. George's Market at the weekend (more on that later) but during the week can be found I the back of Leckey's newsagent at lunchtime. Big awesome wodges of meat in massive cubanos.

[Falafel!](https://www.facebook.com/falafelbotanic) A little Lebanese (I think) place in studentsville. Extremely tasty, good value for money and very friendly.

**Coffee:**

[Kaffe-O!](http://kaffeo.coffee/) Nordic coffee. Really awesome, and you can muck about with their vinyl player. Tasty 'Smørrebrod' open sandwiches. As hipsterry as you're thinking but fuck it, it's good.

[Clements!](http://visit-belfast.com/things-to-do/member/clements-cafs) You'll find these coffee shops all over the city. Some are better than others but all generally pretty great. Try the massive sausage rolls.

**Larger meals:**

[Coppi!](http://www.coppi.co.uk/) Great nuvo-Italian type place in the bustling St Anne's Square. Awesome cocktails too, handy for drinks in town after and next to The Mac which is a pretty good gallery.

[Acapulco!](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Acapulco-Restaurant-Belfast/586288411393050?rf=537246556338807) Further out of the city but a really fun little Mexican. Forget the much-celebrated Boojum - this is way better with killer margaritas. Half price margaritas on Fridays at 6.

[Dirty Duck!](http://thedirtyduckalehouse.co.uk/) Cheap and cheerful, great crab claws fresh from the Lough. Out of the city, 15 minutes on the train. Right by the bay, great beer garden, very chilled out.

[Poacher's Pocket!](http://www.poacherspocketlisbane.com/) Wayyyy further out (a half hour drive) but this place RULES. Big meat, big local beers, down near the lough. Class. 

**Sights:**

Galleries! [Golden Thread](http://goldenthreadgallery.co.uk/) and [The Mac](https://themaclive.com/) are worth checking out. You might catch a decent show in the latter too.

The coast! We have awesome coastlines here. If you're checking out the Giant's Causeway don't head straight there - go to [Portballintrae and walk the cliff/coastal route](http://www.walkni.com/walks/2557/portballintrae-causeway-loop/). Beautiful, honestly. 

Or you can get a great view of the Belfast Lough coastlines if you book out a boat trip in Bangor - Brian Meharg from [Bangor Boat](http://www.bangorboat.com) is your man. Yes, the website is hilariously '90s but the guy is awesome. He runs deep sea fishing jaunts and will tell you some great seafaring tales.

If I can think of more I'll let you know - currently drinking in Donegal!

**EDIT:**

Oops, said I'd get back to [St. George's Market](http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/St-Georges-Market-Belfast-P3230), which I forgot to do.

Basically you should check it out too for some excellent eats and stalls! There's a variety market on Fridays, a food market on Saturdays and then on Sundays it's kind of a mixture of both.

A few other places of note:

[The Spaniard](http://www.thespaniardbar.com/) - tiny little Cathedral Quarter pub with lots of character. Can be bunged and the toilets smell a bit funky but it's worth calling in for a rum cocktail at the start of a night, or a great Bloody Mary and bowl of seafood at brunch time.

[The Oak Lounge](http://www.errigle.com/about/oak-lounge.aspx) - the 'quiet bar' in long-running drinking establishment The Errigle. Table service, good times, also opposite new craft beer joint Brewbot. I haven't been yet but I'm guessing it'll be pretty decent if likely home to a few wabs. Just speculation of course. Also nearby is...

[l'Etoile](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186470-d2702730-Reviews-L_Etoile-Belfast_Northern_Ireland.html) - hearty French food in a cosy little place that looks like someone's living room. Menu rarely changes except for a few specials, and it's beside The Vineyard - the best off license in the city. Which is good news as it is a BYO.

[Tudor Cinema](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=tudor%20cinema%20comber). Again outside of Belfast (half hour in a car or taxi) but so worth a visit. Tiny little self-built cinema owned by Roy Spence, half of the Spence Brothers. Dripping in red velvet and 50s horror movie posters/statues, this place fucking rules. He'll show you any movie you want to bring with you but do yourself a favour - ask him to show you a reel of the horror movies he made with his twin brother from the 50s to 70s. Northern Ireland weirdness meets Americana at its crazy best. So good.

If you fancy a walk I really like the coastal routes - jump on a train to Bangor or Holywood and have a blast!

To combine the British parliament with a de facto English parliament is sloppy and solves none of the actual issues, the desire for more regional representation. EVEL won't give people in England any more representation, people in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will have MSPs, AMs, MLAs as well as MPs. 

Another problem I have with it is that the proposal is being pushed very quickly by the government, without cross-party support, without a proper constitutional committee which looks at all the options, such as regional assemblies in England, and lay out clear cut separations of power. So to me it looks like a party ploy for more power rather than a well thought out policy which will have enormous effects on the country, making those outside England feel less British and hastening the break up of the United Kingdom.

The best solution to the devolution problem is more devolution, to establish regional assemblies in England (an English parliament would be too large and dominate the British parliament), and produce a clear constitutional separation of power. That way regional and national policies can be more easily split and the people of England will actually enjoy the same amount of representation than those in the other nations.

If English issues are dealt with by the UK parliament all members of the UK parliament will have an equal say. If you've no problem with that then fair enough.

&gt; Or restrict England-specific subjects to MP's representing English constituencies - boom, job done.

So you do have a problem with certain members of the UK parliament dealing with the business of the UK parliament? You want to tear voting rights away from certain MPs

&gt; Why are you so keen on spending money on another parliament to achieve the same thing? 

It doesn't achieve the same thing. One makes Scottish MPs second class, with less rights than other MPs. The other ensures all MPs are equal while answering the West Lothian question.

&gt;  The issue is an offshoot/ result of the devolution of Scotland and Wales, not because the English have had a long-running campaign for separation.

So the issue isn't ""England doesn't have enough democracy."" It's ""Scotland and Wales have too much democracy""
