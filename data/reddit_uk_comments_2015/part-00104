There's plenty of evidence to suggest that it would be cheaper by a large amount (cf. the cost of the Irish presidency with what we currently shell out for the Royals), but in terms of aspirational, representative democracy it would be quite a good step if you ask me, and that aspect is certainly ideological. I'm not sure why you think that ideology and practical effects don't intersect at any point though.

Let's save some time!

This is the point where people start talking about tourism and argue with absolutely no shame that they reckon nobody would visit Buckingham Palace if it were open to the public and not a royal residence. Then I point out that none of the current royal-owned attractions (palaces, castles and so on) are even in the Top 10 most visited UK attractions, and that by removing the actual royals from these places we would most likely increase the amount of tourist money we gain from these places. The royals would still be around - and extremely wealthy - but just not in our democracy.

Then someone will talk about how they only cost around 50p a year so why shouldn't we keep them? I'll have to point out that we arrive at that figure by taking the money that Parliament gives the royals every year and dividing it by the entire population, not the *tax-paying* population, and then I'd have to talk about security costs borne by local authorities and lost revenue from lands owned by the Crown as an entity and not by the Queen as an individual, that on abolition would revert to the State.

And so on. The whole thing would be highly dispiriting and nobody would change their mind, and at some point I would probably take umbrage with the idea that having a considered, measured position on the monarchy somehow means that, actually, I just hate posh people. It's easy and lazy to play that card.

In South Belfast, there is no unionist pact so the SDLP will probably hold it, but more importantly SF have put one of their best candidates there, and while he's unlikely to win the seat, he'll win SF a lot of long-term voters there.

North Belfast is the only place it could have made a difference, but it's likely a lot of SDLP voters would have gone to Alliance and stayed there, that and the only thing SF could have offered in return is South Belfast.

null,false,phys1cs,null,null,null,"There are many good non-financial reasons to buy a house, but you should bear in mind that residential property prices in most of London currently appear to be unsustainably high. *The long-run real rate of house price appreciation has historically been close to zero in most of the world*. People were saying the same things about Japanese property prices in the the 1980s, including the whole small island/growing population thing, that they're saying now in the UK. They've said the same thing about crowded cities in the US and Europe too. In the end, the trend everywhere is for 0-1% real house price appreciation. 

It is difficult to separate long-term structural/demographic changes from cyclical effects, but it looks very much as if current house prices in London are driven predominantly by the low cost of capital, an influx of foreign money and the perception of strong momentum in prices. None of these can be relied upon to continue. Rental yields are exceptionally low in many parts of the capital (often negative in real terms after costs excluding mortgage payments), the ratio of house prices to income is exceptionally high, and the rate of house price appreciation in recent years has been unusually high. 

For various reasons including the low turnover, high transaction costs, infrequent valuation, high degree of regional variability, high level and long term of borrowing, financial naïvety of most market participants and peculiar political response to the issue of high house prices, *seemingly unsustainable trends can continue for a very long time.* This does not mean that you too should jump on the bandwagon, unless you're sure that you can afford it if prices and interest rates revert to the trend *and* you will gain considerable emotional benefit from owning the property in the mean time. Many people do. Just recognise that you're buying for emotional and/or speculative reasons, not because it's an objectively good investment.

yes when we were robbed we were not under a Mourinho system. dont mistake the consistency of the years with Avram Grant, Hiddink and Ancellotti to how Mourinho sets up his team. Di Matteo pulled of a miracle it is very unlikely to be repeated, we got through on grit,determination and extremely superb defending. we did it once but those magical wins will not happen again, nor should they be attempted. The context then is completely different to the club now. 

Its not about dreading coming against us because ""our style"", please dont call it that, will be inviting attack after attack after attack and relies on us getting one lucky break and stealing a winner. Parking the bus is quite frankly a pussy tactic and as much as I am a lover of Mourinho I cannot stand behind it, its synonymous with him and its disrespectful to the talent of our team. The 2012 run was under an extremely constraigned context and going through manager after manager and injury after injury I can full see why we did it then. It was a magical year and other things helped us get through remember Messi's penalty miss? even then we played more upfront than we do now... it feels like we are going for tactical wins not footballing wins. In Mourinhos first spell we could compete and play good football against the best teams, if we are to see success on the european stage we need to instil that philosophy in the team. if we park the bus and get used to scraping by the team will never be ready to step up to the occasion when you simply cannot get through by defending non stop against these immensely attacking teams (especially given how shaky our defence looks nowadays). 

&gt;Hopefully one day we can always be positive in our approach but I personally love the way we do things.

playing that way doesnt happen over night. you need to be build on the foundation of controlling games and looking to win by winning not winning by stopping the other team at all costs. Like I said you will not see a run like the 2012 one in a long time and they were under different managers who showed faith in the team, especially Ancellotti. if you love shit football and being too scared to play then get used to us not winning the Champions league for as long as we play in that way",null,0,null,1426786487,null,0,1426786763,0,cpk2q08,null,t3_2zkdkj,null,t1_cpk2q08,null,t1_cpk2bsp,null,null,null,1427857866,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

First off the majority of people currently in apprenticeships are over 19 and further than their first year, which means they're entitled to national minimum wage. Those in their first year or under 19 are receive a minimum of approximately half minimum wage, not a third as you suggest. So technically for the majority they're equally as good as a full-time job in terms of benefits and wages, and significantly better than JSA in terms of monthly income and on the job training.  

Secondly I'm not going to take your word for the fact apprenticeships are bad based on your second hand evidence from your younger brother. Somebody with no work experience won't fully grasp a job in two weeks regardless of if they think they do. Having a job is more than just learning to do a task, you unknowingly pick up information about how to work with experience. Your brother should also have a training plan in place for this apprenticeship and is fully entitled to dispute the lack of adherence to this plan.  

Honestly the fact you're even making a judgement on this subject based on a younger sibling's claim that he ""learnt the job in a week"" is hilarious.

Gaps of traffic - this is something you will have to get a hold of and account for. Every bike is different; some like getting away nice and quick and can do it safely, securely and the bike will feel stable doing it. Other bikes like a bit of a more gradual pull away, so you will naturally have to leave a bigger gap. It is also something you will only be able to judge with experience. Obviously, if you are leaving a gap for two then you need to leave your own gap and probably half that again for your boyfriend. There is no need to rush when pulling across traffic - that is how accidents happen. Take your time, plan your pull away and execute it. Nice and smooth. With time, you'll get smoother and faster.

And of course, the highly raved. Bioderma Sensibio/Créaline  H2O. Although, I find Garnier's just as  good and cheaper, too.

Comparing the two, Milner has fantastic work rate (not just speed), good awareness, and is versatile enough to play almost any position. Navas has great speed, below average awareness, can only play one position and in just one style.

He can't cut inside and show creativity like Nasri or Silva, he can't place his crosses well because he's usually not looking into the box when he's trying to beat his defender, and he can't aim his corner kicks well for reasons unknown.

null,false,JohnMulroy,flair5,,null,"&gt; The window of opportunity has to get smaller when you're older because there are guys 6 years younger that might be ready to come through.

Okay well a 17 year old coming through to a top 6 side is incredibly thin. more like 3 maybe 4 years younger. Yes he has 3ish years less than other prospects to develop, but he hasnt really even had a chance to develop. He was blighted with injuries in the last few years and had a horrible loan spell in france that kept him out a year basically. He can still develop and play a role in the team just as everyone else is developing. We shouldnt gage him on what his ceiling is, just that he is doing well this season. In fact one of out most important players. 

&gt; At this point, how much more can his style of play be revolutionised? 

What is wrong with his style? He does exactly what Poch asks him to do in the system. He has had good performances where people say ""oh he played well"" and some bad performance, like everyone else in the team, where people suddenly say ""hes not good enough, full stop"" 


&gt; He'll serve a purpose like Parker did but when he's been replaced by (hopefully) someone more capable than him,

Not sure what youre getting at here. Is this not true for any player? Just cause mason is a couple years older, doesnt mean he cant become a better player for the amount of time he still has left in his career. 

&gt;  I doubt we'll be losing sleep over it.

This, i just dont understand. How can you say that? he has given around 8 years of his life to the club, crafting and toiling away to play for his boyhood club. I feel connected to him. That is ultimately what the point of supporting a club is about. If mason ends up playing 5-10 years in the side and we dont win anything, i wont give a fuck. i dont give a fuck about success. All i want, and all everyone should want, is a tottenham that you can connect to. He clearly gives a shit on the pitch and not in a lewis holtby manner where he is good at twitter and instagram. What kind of message will it send to the other youth academy prospects when a player like Mason, has really done everything hes been asked to do, and has had just as many poor games as everyone else, and then gets replaced by some mercenary? I completely support the idea of him having to fight for his place. Im not saying his spot shouldnt be challenged, but why do we need to find someone better? Lets not forget it was basically him that got us through the Forest match with that wonder goal, got in Benteke's face and got him sent of which sparked our team up, i think he left one on Rodriguez in the Hull match tht led him to getting sent off. Also, taking the shot that led to kanes first goal against aresnal, not to mention being superb in that game. So what else is he supposed to do to atleast start in the Starting 11 next season. i feel like people are basing how good he is on his future, rather than how he played this season. i think as a youth academy product coming through his first season even though he is older, he has more than justified his place in the team.

&gt; Oh, and we already had a Brazilian that wasn't very good at tackling and put himself about a bit. He now plays for QPR and we don't miss him at all. So that ""if his name"" rubbish is just that... rubbish.

 Fair play, pretty weak point.

The Reference to the third of his colleagues wage was entirely true in his case. I made no reference to them being on min wage.
Are they really as good as a full time role? I'd argue that on financial terms alone they are not, as for benefits that depends entirely on the employer and as a general rule the less you earn the lower the perks and benefits of the job. On the job training for the bogus apprenticeships is not exactly the priority, is it? You're not going to offer a two or three year college course to a one year apprentice, it's poxy manual handling sessions that last 3 hours, health and safety certificates that mean little outside of their current employer.

I would agree with you about learning the job, if you were talking about electricians, and engineers. not street cleaners and shop assistants. There simply isn't as much to learn. If they were paid only slightly less than min wage it would be less of a problem(say the minimum wage for 18-20yr olds, which was brought in to solve the exact same problem i might add), especially given the fact that these really are not genuine apprenticeships. Just lowly paid jobs.

I actually agree with him, he is a street cleaner, there wasn't alot to pick up. Integrated? He turns ups and does the job as required, I well imagine that suffices.

You are of course entitled to you opinion, I however find your dismissal of a dissenting opinion because its come from someone i know daft, If we never took account of how something is effecting people and just took one source of information or one side of any story it would all be a bit lopsided. Just because something appears to be a success on paper it does not always correlate with it been a good idea or a fair one, see the JSA sactions mess and those 'lovely' people assessing DLA and ESA claims. I can only base my knowledge the scheme based what I see of it and on family and friends, and they are resentful towards it. If they were saying other wise my thoughts may be slightly more supportive.

I still maintain that is wrong to do the same job and yet be paid much less, if you were to change the age issue to another one i'm sure there would be a little more concern. 
The idea of apprenticeships is good and giving young people a chance to gain experience is great, but the execution of it in this case is lacking. It shouldn't be low skilled jobs offering these one year and one day apprenticeships but trades, skilled roles over a longer period that offer something more tangable in the long term, nationally recognised qualifactions and much needed skills in an aging workplace.

Otherwise you might as well slash the minimum wage for young people, it'd acheive the same thing and the same level of discrimination without making silly little loopholes and wasting money subsidising cheap labour for businesses.

There are plenty of others out there, and if you really get stung then that's what a lawyer on commission is for. Cashflow is important, and that's why we have business loans to help smooth that sort of thing - but businesses don't have a right for things to be easy, and some of them will fail. That's capitalism, though; occasionally circumstances will just fuck you, out of the blue. If this sounds like a bad thing, then while one hand gives out free access to tribunals for employees, the other should be tweaking the commercial lending market towards institutions which support rather than asset-strip businesses in temporary difficulty; but they're separate issues. 

If the problem is time, that's what a lawyer is for. If your business is big enough that a court case would disrupt normal operations unacceptably, then it's big enough to have a lawyer on retainer. That's what retainers are for. 

Arbitration is all well and good, when it's paid for independently. As it stands, arbitration is predominantly paid for by the companies who use it as an alternative to court. The conflict of interest is pretty plain, and pretty inescapable, especially given that the arbitration market is competitive. When the time comes to renew your contract with the arbitration service, will you buy from the one that ruled against you 90% of the time? 

The courts, of course, *are* an arbitration service. They're a very good one, which requires a substantial public investment in order to run well; in the last few decades enormous strides have been made towards making them as cost-efficient as possible, while maintaining absolute trust in impartiality. Employment tribunals were brought in as a cutting-down of full-blown civil proceedings, that dispensed with many of the things that a civil court needs for non-employment matters, in an effort to bring costs down further. By all accounts, they did a good job. Involving the private sector in an effort to cut costs further is not a solution, when there's a possibility of competing on quality and not price.

With Pochettino, I'd say there's definitely reason to be optimistic. We've seen Rose improve basically right across the board, getting better in all statistical categories, and we've also seen clear improvement from Townsend as well. Seeing the kind of talent that he helped bring to fruitition at Southampton is also encouraging. You never can tell with prospects. From watching hockey players develop for a long time, I've concluded that there's a rough ""rule of four"" with prospects. Take any four random prospects, excluding really top-notch, stand-out talents as well as players who are clearly destined for the lowest levels.

This is where you and I differ.  My current main focus company would manage this in a heartbeat, but 12 months ago, it would have ended us.  I could give countless examples of small businesses in this situation.  Small businesses with only six figure turnovers, and low margins.

The key is to provide a mechanism that works well for people of all levels.  The current system, to me, doesn't do that.  I'm helping (and paying for) a friend because I was so outraged by the previous employer withholding funds in the manner they are doing.   If I was not doing this, the person in question would have no help, they simply don't have the knowledge or time to acquire it.

To me, anyone who is going to be doing something like this, any claimant who could afford the time under the old system, can afford the couple of hundred quid, brash generalisation, but it should prevent abuse.  Meanwhile, the old system and the new system alike, fails to help these people.  However, the new system does help small business.  So whilst it's not good yet, I don't think it's a bad change.

Davros came up with the dalek machine under the guise of it being a mobility device so that the mutants could maintain a certain quality of life and environmental control, what the Kaleds didn't figure out until it was too late was that the Kaled mutants Davros had had been tampered with in such a way that they were basically programmed to be genocidal and pure evil and you know the rest. So yeah, it's all connected, there are deliberately some disparities in their origins over time because of course the Doctor being sent back to their creation in Genesis of the Daleks changes all of history, hence why the daleks that we know are so different from the originals that the Doctor killed all of the first time they met.

Also, with the price tag Real would pay for Pogba, he'd definitely start. Look at what happened with Torres, after awhile, he was only playing because of his price tag and wages.

&gt;If I was not doing this, the person in question would have no help, they simply don't have the knowledge or time to acquire it.

but then 
&gt;any claimant who could afford the time under the old system, can afford the couple of hundred quid

which are logical opposites; if your friend was out on their ear with no further work ready, they'd have time but be in a cash crisis of their own. Under the old system, they would be in a position to go to tribunal; under the new one, they might not, because they need that £1250 (at least) in reserve in case they can't find new work immediately. The current situation with JSA and out-of-work benefits means that for even moderately well-off people who find themselves unexpectedly unemployed, they often will not countenance something like an employment tribunal route, when that route is being made more protracted and costly. 

This is a conscious decision by the Government: by making it more difficult and slower to get a decision by a tribunal, they *are* reducing the likelihood of vexatious claims being made. However, they're throwing the baby out with the bathwater - it's doing far more to discourage legitimate claimants (who always made up the bulk of tribunals anyway) than it is to stop the minority of bullshit ones. 

Let's not forget that under the old regime, there were lots of recourses available to a business who defended a vexatious claim and won - costs awards, civil actions, and indeed perjury/conspiracy to pervert the course of justice charges for people who actively tried to deceive a tribunal in order to unjustly win money. These measures were pretty effective overall, and as I said before, for the minority of cases where businesses were temporarily inconvenienced but were in the right overall, that's what insurance is for. 
&gt;However, I think we need to do more.

You're arguing that we should do less, though, by making it harder for legitimate claimants who don't have resources (financial or social) to bring to bear in their support while they pursue a case. If you're in favour of doing more, you should be in favour of measures that *increase* access to justice: no upfront fees, high-quality legal aid, etc - for both parties in a case. There's a good argument that small businesses should have a right to legal aid for employment tribunals as well, but there isn't one that we should *reduce* the ability of people with genuine claims, to be able to bring those in front of a real court, with all the protections and safeguards of impartiality that entails - even if it's expensive. I mean, it would be cheap if we abandoned policing entirely, but small businesses would be more upset by being robbed continuously than the (significant) cut in their corporation tax bill that would accrue from the reduced public spending.

They had no such luxury, they had to take another job, which wasn't so good, two days later.  London is an expensive place.

The problem is, someone who can't find £100 to pay to potentially fight something, probably, can't afford the time to not be earning money.  Again, it's not just businesses that have legal insurance.

&gt;Let's not forget that under the old regime, there were lots of recourses available to a business who defended a vexatious claim and won 

The problem is, many, many insurances don't want that.  The cost of defending is so high.  Have you ever witness a false, a malicious claim?  The worst I have, was against a man, in a day nursery.  Caught a member of staff with their hand in the till, they broke down in tears, promised they would resign if the police were not involved (a GNCQ nursery nurse needs a enhanced CRB), idiot let her.  Two weeks later claims of sexual molestation were made against him.  6 months.  For 6 months he couldn't work.  Now it's easy to find no evidence, hard, almost impossible, to prove that he was innocent.  Meanwhile, a claim was put in to tribunal for constructive dismissal.

Small businesses need protection.  Workers need protection.  That balance is key.

I'm not pretending my sample is representative, it's not.

Lots of drivers aren't aware enough of cyclists on the roads but there are so many cunts cycling around too. Two examples from today:

* Left work at lunch to go grab food. Walking along the Lagan opposite the Waterfront (since the rear of it is closed) to cross at the Albert bridge. There's me and another fella walking, so plenty of room for him to get past. I was in the middle of the path and my friend to my left by the railing. Cyclist came flying along, staring straight at me and no word of a lie deliberately cycled into me. It was so bizarre. He just stared at me and cycled straight for me and made no effort to deviate from his trajectory at all and clipped the side of me. Fucking cunt.

* Second thing I saw today was down Ormeau where there is a dual lane one way street that comes up to filter on to it. Cyclist with no helmet on came up that one way street and went straight from the footpath into the traffic and must've missed a minibus by inches.

Not even close to luiz in terms of passing and ball ability though. Luiz is a very rare player that very rarely comes around. His ball ability, free kicks, passing, vision, etc are all light years away from Varane. Varane is very much in the mold of your typical CB, just a little bit more polished. Luiz is almost a midfielder playing as a defender at times.

No need to even talk about Varane as a DM though in my view. He would easily walk into our starting lineup. It would be Varane -Terry combo without a doubt.

Used by the Office for National Statistics. One of the key stats is even LOWER than the original CIPD figures...

&gt;Where there are comparable figures, results from the CIPD survey are similar to those
from the LFS and show that:
24% of those employed on “zero-hours contracts” are looking for another job (compared with
14% from the LFS).

Visible capillaries are common in both papulopustular and erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, AFAIK they are not caused by inappropriate skincare products but may be worsened by them. They may or may not subside as you get your rosacea under control with prescription medication, super gentle skincare, diet and lifestyle modification.

As you have identified rosacea is a condition of hypersensitivity and chronic inflammation. Do be aware the papules and pustules are NOT the same as those in acne vulgaris, they are NOT linked to clogged pores nor acne bacteria so require very different treatment. It is thought that all rosacea medication is effective due to their anti inflammatory not their antibacterial properties. 

Like you I have been diagnosed with papulopustular rosacea but am prescribed the prescription topical azelaic acid (Finacea). I have posted two lists of articles on skincare from a dermatology perspective over on /r/rosaceahelp/ which are well worth reading, and various product reviews linked to from the sidebar here on SCA UK.

As a rosacean your most important skincare product from spring through autumn is a broad spectrum sunscreen. If you don't have a good one watch out for our next mega review topic which is on sunscreen. Second most important product is a super gentle cleanser.

Lastly ensure you consistently meet or exceed ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. Especially useful are oily fish, whole eggs, seeds such as pumpkin and chia, walnuts, bran, unsweetened cocoa (if not a flush/ flare trigger for you). These supply plenty of magnesium, long and short chain omega-3s and bioavailable vitamin D.

null,false,hexapodium,null,null,null,"Your argument seems to boil down to ""because serious allegations are very serious matters, it should be harder to make them"", and that doesn't really follow: making legitimate allegations should be exactly as easy or difficult regardless of their seriousness, because not everyone who makes a serious allegation has the means to surmount a financial hurdle in doing so. To perhaps drift into hyperbole a little, rape allegations are unambiguously more serious than petty theft ones, but we don't (and it would be unthinkable to) expect people who report rapes pay a bond up front for the privilege of accessing justice. That principle should apply to *all* legal actions: cost should not be a barrier. Expecting people on minimum wage (or below) to stump up £1250 in a couple of months (because your window for beginning your tribunal case is not large) in exchange for the right to get their case heard impartially, is unreasonable. People should never have to choose between defending their legal rights, and eating, and that's the effect on the lowest earners of imposing cost to apply to a tribunal. 

In your example, if the man in question had access to a good lawyer via legal aid, it would have been a pretty clear route to try that case, find him (""reasonable doubt"" standard, because it's a criminal allegation as well as an employment one) innocent, and then for him to make a civil claim, again with legal aid, against the woman for his lost earnings and reputational damage. The tribunal, can make its' findings contingent or delayed based on the outcome of other cases which are materially relevant. In short, the legal system would have operated better, had *all* parties had full access to justice. 

&gt;Small businesses need protection. Workers need protection. That balance is key.

We already have a system for striking that balance, in the legal system. The disruption of that balance is coming from attempts to deliver those services on the cheap, while carving out narrow exemptions for politically touchy classes, when if you look holistically at what's going on, you can quite easily say ""society as a whole benefits from a well-funded justice system, free to good-faith litigants without other means of paying"" (which is in line with the thrust of your argument). My disagreement is that we shouldn't try to tier access to justice or make people jump through extra hoops, in cost or time; the courts already have a mechanism for doing that in motions to dismiss, and the threat of cost awards for those found vexatious or negligently at fault. Where proceedings do continue, it's usually because either the courts have found some merit (or doubt) in the claim, and socially we should be interested in getting those claims resolved fairly. Nobody benefits from a society where vexatious claims are easy to make (except vexatious claimants), but neither does anyone except unscrupulous employers benefit from a society where legitimate ones are prevented from being heard.

[Krugman;] (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/opinion/paul-krugman-the-obama-recovery.html?_r=0)
&gt;Let’s start with a tale from overseas: austerity policy in Britain. As you may know, back in 2010 Britain’s newly installed Conservative government declared that a sharp reduction in budget deficits was needed to keep Britain from turning into Greece. Over the next two years growth in the British economy, which had been recovering fairly well from the financial crisis, more or less stalled. In 2013, however, growth picked up again — and the British government claimed vindication for its policies. Was this claim justified?

&gt;No, not at all. What actually happened was that the Tories stopped tightening the screws — they didn’t reverse the austerity that had already occurred, but they effectively put a hold on further cuts. So they stopped hitting Britain in the head with that baseball bat. And sure enough, the nation started feeling better.

&gt;To claim that this bounceback vindicated austerity is silly. As Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University likes to point out, if rapid growth after a gratuitous slump counts as success, the government should just close down half the economy for a year; the next year’s growth would be fantastic. Or as I’d put it, you shouldn’t conclude that hitting yourself in the head is smart because it feels so good when you stop.",null,0,null,1426800578,null,0,false,0,cpkbsjv,null,t3_2zki23,null,t1_cpkbsjv,null,t1_cpjztt2,null,null,null,1427862203,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

We actually had the opposite problem when he took over the Sixers.  Our executives were some of the worst in the league.  He cleaned house and installed a new regime heavily focused on statistics and long term results.  I understand that with relegation short term success is equally important so I would look for him to employ those with knowledge of the league.  

It is likely that he will focus on cultivating players and finding hidden gems instead of paying for aging stars.  The Sixers are by far the youngest team in the NBA with very little veteran presence. It seems CP is a mid-level organization so this cost-efficient approach makes even more sense in context.

Overall, he seems like a good fit for the organization.  Also, I've been meaning to get into the EPL so I think I'll start following CP, as shared ownership seems as good a reason as any to pick a team.

&gt; So the Treasury is taking in about £12 billion directly from tobacco sales.

Now in this upcoming election, both parties are visibly panicking as their previously ""safe"" base is being eaten away from both sides.

From the right, we have UKIP. I don't like UKIP, but I share one thing with their supporters in that they, just like me, are sick of two party politics and are willing to take a chance with a new party. You can tell that Cameron who is actually rather moderate is frantically throwing bones to the far right in fear.

And from the left, we have LibDems and Green. Too extreme or not extreme enough, that's up to the individual voter, but make no mistake, enough people are considering it that even the media has had to give in and give them coverage and a place in the debates. Meanwhile, Labour is desperately trying to play the strategic voting card because they know that more and more people just aren't going to stand for it any more.

Some punters are saying this will be an easy win for Labour, some say neither will have enough votes to avoid a coalition.

YOU: Then desperate people will take the job and those wanting a fixed contract will find it harder to find a job.

If we vote, then complain, they have no reason to listen to the complaint, because we've done what they wanted and perpetuated the system that benefits them.

Young people *do* vote. According to the same figures that put 65-and-overs at 75% turnout in the last election, young people (18-24) had a 44% turnout. Now, even if you somehow managed to bump that up to the 75% of 65-and-overs, the total number of young people is comparatively smaller, which means the total number of votes that that extra 31% turnout would add, split among all the different political parties, would be negligible (less than an increase of 1% of votes for any single political party).

It's become popular to tell young people that they should vote, because then the politicians would listen and if they don't vote, they'll be ignored. The reality is that they don't have much voting power even with a high turnout, so they'll be ignored whether they vote or not. Additionally, their higher turnout would contribute to the turnout figures, which makes it look like more people are satisfied with first-past-the-post. At least with a low turnout, the media tends to ask why people aren't voting, but a high turnout allows politicians to say ""look at how many people are voting! Why would we change the system that clearly works?""

We don't vote for the sake of voting. Voting is meant to be the delivery mechanism for representation. As it is, if you vote for anyone but the party that wins in your constituency, you don't get due representation, but you *do* help prop up the system that isn't giving you the representation you deserve.

Err from the link you provided...

&gt; While smoking has a direct impact on the NHS, it can also be said to have an indirect impact on society more widely (for instance, fire services need to be called out to incidents caused by smoking and ill health can result in more absenteeism). The think tank Policy Exchange made an attempt at quantifying the wider costs, coming up with a £14 billion total (including the £2.7 billion NHS costs).

...

&gt; The government takes in a total of about £9.5 billion in tobacco duties, and the Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association estimates another £2.6 billion goes to the Treasury in VAT. So the Treasury is taking in about £12 billion directly from tobacco sales.

So from your own source smoking is estimated to have cost the country £14 billion while only raising funds of £12 billion.

Higher, but probably somewhat explained by the composition of the economy (tourism especially) and also of the extreme levels of deprivation that exist in, especially, parts of Strathclyde but also elsewhere (leading to the Government to use enterprise zones to attract e.g. amazon fulfilment centres and call centres. 

I can't do a comparison for low-paid jobs, the figures aren't in the article, but one of the large reasons that the deficit targets have been missed are the *hugely* disappointing levels of wage growth and the creation of low-paying jobs. They've had a knock-on effect on income-tax receipts, which have been way lower than was predicted (even accounting for the cuts to the tax). The root cause of that is supposedly the low levels of productivity growth in the economy.

Compare ourselves with any nation in Europe on unemployment, growth, inflation, pretty much any actual metric and we are miles ahead.

2) All the job statistics and metrics show an increase in full time employment and only a small increase in zero hours contracts (of which the majority of are happy to be on zero hours contracts and I think only 25% were looking for extra hours). Now I'm not saying that zero hours contracts are good, because they do open up cases for abuse in the labour market but I don't think they are the problem that people would like you to believe they are. Unemployment in this country is at the lowest since records began. More people are in work and more people are in secure full time work. The impression I get is that you would rather people have no jobs than what you consider to be 'menial jobs'.

3) I see this posted a lot on this board. 'Osborne has borrowed more than labour did in thirteen years' nonsense. When you inherit a budget deficit of 150 billion pounds a year you have to borrow 150 billion pounds a year to fund it. The only way he could have borrowed less would've been to shut down the NHS the armed forces and most of the education department combined more or less overnight after winning the election in 2010. This picture sums it up nicely and you can see why Labour totally messed everything up. http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/20/1363802502484/Deficits-by-chancellor-001.jpg Outrageous levels of spending in boom years and then when the crisis hits look at the huge deficit that kicks in (this picture also excludes bailouts made during and after the 2008 crisis).

Gordon Brown abolished the 10p tax rate for low income earners and the personal tax allowance went up by about 1900 pounds over 13 years. Under George Osborne it will have gone up almost more than 5000 pounds over 6 years. For 12 years and 11 months of the last Labour government the top rate of income tax was 40%, under George Osborne they pay 45%. The top 1% of people in this country pay about 25% of income tax, the top 10% pay just under half and the top 25% pay around 75% of all income tax in this country and the top 50% pay around 90% of income tax.

From [The Swiss Ramble](http://swissramble.blogspot.com/2015/03/liverpool-show-of-strength.html) 

&gt; Ayre noted, “Revenue has been consistently increasing from around £170 million in 2009 to over £250 million today”, which is largely true, though the growth is actually £78 million (44%) from £177 million in 2009. It’s also worth noting that the majority of this growth (£67 million) has come in the last two seasons, as revenue was relatively flat over the previous seasons, partly due to the disappearance of Champions League revenue, which offset commercial growth (including bringing catering revenue back in-house in 2010/11.

&gt; The absence of Champions League money has restricted the growth in broadcasting revenue since 2009 to “only” 35% (£26 million), largely due to the new Premier League TV deals, though also partly because of the inclusion of Liverpoolfc.TV Limited in the club’s figures. Commercial income has, in fact, been the main growth driver, increasing by 72% (£44 million) over the same period, while match day income has risen by a more modest 20% (£8 million).""

The fact of the matter is, EVERYBODY knows that the next Premier League TV deal represents a massive increase from the current one (which was a massive increase from its predecessor, and so on). Where will the increased revenue go?  If Liverpool's revenue is almost 50% more than it was in 2009 (which is probably substantially higher than it was in 2004, and so on), wouldn't at least some of that lead to an increase in wages? A £100k per week player now is a ~£75k per week player from 2009. And perhaps a ~£50k per week player in 2005. 

I wish that teams would seriously consider giving back the revenue to the fans. In fact, I feel that this is something that the FA or the Premier League should have somehow figured a way to insist upon as part of the TV deal. If a certain percentage of that revenue was required to be spent, say, providing low cost tickets to fans/kids/etc., the atmosphere in the ground would likely improve, which I think would substantially improve the TV product that the Premier League has turned into a global brand.

I am almost literally flipped with you on a lot of your best/worst choices.  I like that you gave some love to Father's Day, which I think is unfairly maligned, and agree with you that series 4 is top notch throughout.  

I will never understand the almost universal hatred of Rings of Akhaten either, but I have learned to accept being in a very small minority.  Fine then, more Akhaten for me.   Its one of very few stories where earth, or human colonists are not the ones in peril.  
Here's my quick take best and worst episodes from each series, and series listed from best to worst (imo)

Series 4:
Best: Unicorn and the Wasp
Worst: Doctor's Daughter (though its still quite good)  

Series 8:
Best: Dark Water/Heath in Heaven
Worst: In the Forest of the Night (though I honestly like it a lot, I just like all of the other series 8 eps more)

Series 2:
Best: School Reunion
Worst: Fear Her

Series 1:
Best: The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances
Worst: Aliens of London/World War 3

Series 5:
Best: The Beast Below
Worst: Time of the Angels/Flesh and Stone

Series 3:
Best: Human Nature/Family of Blood
Worst: The Lazarus Experiment

Series 7:
Best: Rings of Akhaten
Worst: The Power of Three

Worst Season: Series 6 by a country mile
Best: The Doctor's Wife
Worst: Closing Time

Christmas:
Best: The Christmas Carol
Worst: The Christmas Invasion (though I don't dislike any of the Christmas Specials)

Specials: 
Best: Day of the Doctor
Worst: Planet of the Dead (but I still like it)

Serie A is a poor league, 'shite' is probably a bit hyperbolic but it is a poor league. Nowhere near the quality it was 7 or 8 years ago, let alone 9 or 10.

The UEFA coefficient rankings have it placed as 4th among all European leagues. Listed as follows:

1. Spain
2. England
3. Germany
4. Italy
5. Portugal
6. France

Serie A used to get 4 Champions League qualifying league positions (i.e the top four league positions qualify for CL football), now they only get three; the same as Ligue 1 and the Portuguese Primeria Liga.

In the individual club coefficient rankings, based upon success in the Champions League and the Europa League over the past 5 years, there is only one Italian club currently in the top 20. 

That club is Juventus in 20th place, a place below Spurs. A team that sweeps all before it in Serie A doing similar in Europe to a top 6 or 7 Premier League side.

The top 5 is as follows:

1. Real Madrid
2. Barcelona
3. Bayern Munich
4. Chelsea
5. Atletico Madrid

La Liga, the Premier League and the Bundesliga are Europe's strongest and most competitive leagues.

Serie A is a shadow of its former self, and is a poor league in comparison. Its equivalents are Ligue 1 and the Primeria Liga, not the Premier League or La Liga.

Eight or nine years ago it was one of the strongest leagues in the world; Italian clubs were regularly reaching the latter stages of the Champions League and winning it outright. The Italian national team won the World Cup in 2006. Italian clubs were always among the favourites for the Champions League. Serie A was a prime destination for Europe's most sought after players.

Can you say that now? No, you can't.

Barring some reasonable and recent European success for Juventus, Italian clubs are also rans in the Champions League. The world's top players no longer flock to Serie A, they make their name in Serie A and then leave for bigger things in either the Premier League, La Liga or the Bundesliga (Bayern Munich).

Your right it shouldn't be veiwed with disdain, it should be an alternative for those who prefer(or not able) not to go down the academic route, but at the same time its needs to be worth it, financially and in terms of end product.

I agree, there is alot of work to be done. A higher wage on the shorter term ones would help, might even put the bogus ones off.

The old scheme was excellent(though generally only for trades) but it was slowly killed off. The current model has potential and more importantly, funding.

Walcott is a finished product, that is something we need to start buying more of if we want to compete at the highest level. Depay although a good player has only started really getting to a high level this season, and that is in a Dutch league which can be hit and miss.

Walcott also can play as a striker and as a wide midfielder. This versatility is key for players on our team as we rotate a lot. Depay can also play as a striker but like I said earlier it is a huge leap from the Dutch league into the Premier League.

I should also clarify that if we did sign Depay I wouldn't be disappointed, I think he is a good player and would do well here. But I also think for the £20m+ that it will probably cost, we can spend that money on different positions.

Walcott also has a very good Goal/Assist record for the last two seasons.

13/14 he started 19 times, scored 7 times and assisted 5 times.

12/13  he started 33 times, scored 22 and assisted 16 times.

I'm on mobile and about to sleep so can't (be bothered) to link unfortunately. You do seem to be on the cusp of where flat fees will be the go to position for you. They also have some model asset allocations which will hopefully help you through the fog - I used them as a guide when I set myself up 6 months or so ago.

Although you've no immediate plans to buy a house, I'd be sorely tempted to hedge your bets and put money into the new help to buy ISA. The 25% uplift is pretty similar to the impact of basic rate relief in the pension, and with the caps on the ISA you'd be able to do both that and a pension side by side? 

I just fear that at 27 you're committing all of your savings eggs into one basket and it doesn't give you a lot of leeway if an opportunity comes up that you'd need some cash for.

Re asset allocation, I guess it depends how much flexibility you have with your work portfolio. I'd almost be tempted to treat the work one as a bonus for the time being, certainly until you're totally clear what you want to do with your personal pension. I'd chuck the whole lot into a passive whole world tracker for the time being. 

You sound a lot like I was until about 6 months ago. I'd spent 2 years doing loads of research... but hadn't actually done anything. 

I'm not qualified to give financial advice, but in general I would suggest that:

- 27 is a very early age to commit almost all savings into an inaccessible pension pot
- you risk very little by just getting on with it and stopping faffing.
- this doesn't meant committing all of your funds. You can start with £200-£300 per month whilst you get used to it, because once that money's invested in a pension you're not seeing it for 40 years
- choosing slightly incorrect funds or platform isn't going to kill you. The switching costs aren't extortionate, certainly compared to the mental cost of you feeling overwhelmed and unable to make a decision.
- you can go to see an advisor and get help with this stuff. It'll cost money, and frankly you sound well read enough not to need one. I think you just need a kick up the backside to make a decision!

http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_earthling/2002/04/wasarafat_the_problem.single.html

&gt;There were actually two Barak offers to Arafat—one at Camp David, and a more generous one that took shape over ensuing months, culminating in failed negotiations in Taba, Egypt, in January of 2001. Most Arafat critics, like Rabbi Weiner, focus on Camp David. So, let's look at Camp David first and Taba second.

&gt;David Horowitz, editor of the Jerusalem Report, recently said on the NPR show To the Point that Barak offered ""basically all the territory the Palestinians were purporting to seek."" This is a widely repeated claim—that Israel offered something like the ""pre-1967 borders"" that had long been the mantra of Palestinians who favored a two-state solution. But for Palestinians to get all the territory that had been under Arab control before the war of 1967 would mean getting a) all of what we now think of as the West Bank; b) all of East Jerusalem (which some consider part of the West Bank); and c) all of the walled ""Old City"" that lies between East and West Jerusalem. Barak never offered any of those things—not at Camp David, not at Taba.

&gt;So, Barak hung on to key parts of the Old City and proposed that, before surrendering the West Bank, Israel would annex 9 percent of it, leaving 91 percent for the Palestinians.  That was his last, best offer, at Camp David.  

&gt;But wait. Didn't Barak, as his defenders say, offer Arafat land from Israel proper in return for the annexed 9 percent?

&gt;Yes. But the terms of the trade bordered on insulting. In exchange for the 9 percent of the West Bank annexed by Israel, Arafat would have gotten land as large as 1 percent of the West Bank. And, whereas some of the 9 percent was choice land, symbolically important to Palestinians, the 1 percent was land whose location wasn't even specified. 

&gt;I'm trying to imagine Yasser Arafat selling this 9-to-1 land swap to Palestinians—who, remember, are divided into two camps: the ""return to 1967 borders"" crowd and the ""destroy the state of Israel"" crowd. I'm not succeeding. And Arafat would have had to explain other unpalatable details, such as Israeli sovereignty over Haram al-Sharif (site of the Al-Aqsa Mosque), which had been under Arab control before 1967 and is the third-holiest site in Islam.

&gt;The Camp David offer also had features that kept it from amounting to statehood in the full sense of the term. The new Palestine couldn't have had a military and wouldn't have had sovereignty over its air space—Israeli jets would roam at will. Nor would the Palestinians' freedom of movement on the ground have been guaranteed. At least one east-west Israeli-controlled road would slice all the way across the West Bank, and Israel would be entitled to declare emergencies during which Palestinians couldn't cross the road. Imagine if a mortal enemy of America's—say the Soviet Union during the Cold War—was legally entitled to stop the north-south flow of Americans and American commerce. Don't you think the average American might ask: Wait a minute—who negotiated this deal?

&gt;I'm not saying any of these things aren't defensible from an Israeli point of view. I'm just saying it takes very little imagination to see why Palestinians might balk, after three decades of nursing a grievance centered on—at the very minimum—the right to have their very own state defined by pre-1967 borders.

the bigger point i was trying to make and probably just didn't fully articulate is that sturridge changes the dynamic of this team in such a way that others don't. just watch the next game and count how many times sturridge's movement brings two defenders with him. and then next time sterling plays up top, count. with coutinho, enough said, he's been our best player this last few months. and hendo, well he's fucking hendo, he puts in a few game changing goals, runs his ass off and is the most important cog of the machine right now...so you are absolutely right i need to frame my comment a little better so i will change my statement to sturridge is still our BIGGEST game changer, regardless of form.

* Currently Britain does not recognise Palestine as a country. Only the state of Israel. There *was* a vote on this issue [in Parliament last year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29596822), but it was only symbolic.

* Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu was re-elected a couple of days ago, winning a fourth term in government. His right-wing Likud party has never been particularly constructive towards achieving a peace deal with Palestine *(I'm trying to be balanced here - I think that's a fair thing to say)*.

* In the run-up to the elections Likud fell behind in the polls and its leadership panicked. Netanyahu appealed to his core supporters to turn out and vote, and used hardline rhetoric about Israel's security being in danger. He vowed that he would [not allow](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-31904962) the creation of an independent Palestinian state.

* Nick Clegg is essentially saying here that the international community would not find this position acceptable. Most parties involved in encouraging Israel and Palestine to discuss peace (namely the UN, EU, and Israel's main partner the US) want a two-state solution.

Of course people are going to feel they are being forced into something if they feel as if they are not allowed to freely engage with it. 

So as backwards as this sounds the hope for a better future is to fight back against the claims of racism when white people express their opinion (as much as I like the paper I'm looking at you The Guardian). 

Even if these opinions **are** in fact racist shutting them out of the conversation does not make them go away or alleviate their views, it just alienates them. This is whole reason UKIP has such a big following, not because there is a large silent vein of racist bastards in our country but because many people who are not particularly racist feel they cannot engage in topics which involve race.

I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with this statement, but a good way to get the point across here that you want to say is to say that ""there has been little progress under the Likud party"" and likewise for basically all other statements regarding Israel-Palestine. 

If you say someone is being unconstructive, then it's that person's fault. If you see that progress hasn't happened, then it could be anybody's fault.

If you make any statement which either side can interpret as placing the blame then whoever feels like they're being blamed will jump on it and so will all their friends. Essentially, both sides claim that it is *the other's fault* that there has been no progress and *therefore* both sides claim that it's not their fault it's they've been unconstructive (and to an extent that's true). 

I'm only mentioning any of this because you seemed slightly uncertain as to what would be a balanced statement, so here's my (battled tested) thoughts on what a balanced way to talk is.

I think it's naive to think that there isn't a significant proportion of the white population, rightly or wrongly, that feel that they have to be guarded when talking about race issues.

2 - your academic qualifications are by far the most important. Focus as much energy as you can into getting the highest grades you can. Beyond that, read books about computer science. This will give you some familiarity with stuff that's presented to you at interview, something to talk about in your personal statement and - most importantly - a solid grounding to work from if you get in. Things like algorithmic complexity are good to have some awareness of. But extra stuff will never make up for grades that aren't up to scratch. You need to be getting great grades. Any extra curricular stuff that doesn't relate to the course directly really wont affect your chances at all, they don't care if you were your house captain or whatever, they care at how well you'll cope with the course. 

3 - Not a problem at all. I didn't study Physics beyond GCSE level, and I got in without it ever coming up. In first year you choose one extra science to take along side comp sci. Most people who did physics chose that, I just chose psychology instead. As the other person said, Maths is crucial

Getting the front sprocket off can be a ballache. Do this first, leave the old chain and rear sprocket on. Either put a block of wood through the wheel to brace it against the swingarm and stop it from moving or get a friend to stand on the rear brake. This will stop the front sprocket and output shaft spinning so you can undo the nut. Check for locking tabs before you go at it with the correct size socket and a looooong breaker bar. 

Don't be tempted to leave it in gear as you'll put stress on the transmission. 

After that it's pretty easy! Cut the old chain with a grinder and cutting disc. Fitting the master link on the new chain can be fiddly, you'll need a special tool for that. Still, the cost of tools and parts should be a lot less than your quote and you'll have the satisfaction of doing it yourself as well as some nice shiny new tools.

I could be wrong about this.  I hope I am.  It might be his agent and he legitimately might be waiting until the end of the season.  I think he's showing his immaturity here and if he doesn't realize what is really in his own best interest he is going to ruin his career.

I don't blame Suarez for going to Barcelona because he loves that team and can make the squad every game, but Sterling is not in that situation.  At least not yet.    

What is the actual, tangible difference between getting paid 120,000 a week and 150,000 a week.  It's an extra million and a half per year.  But the real question is what can't you buy with 6.2 million pounds that you can't buy with 7.8 million pounds.

He will go on to have a much better career and make lots more money in the long term if he stays at Liverpool and develops.  I hope he can comes to that realization before it is too late.

As an example one of the ladies in the audience asked (I'm paraphrasing slightly), ""If living conditions are getting better as the government is suggesting, why do many working class families not feel better off"". The rebuttal was a statistic that was recently released that on average households in the UK are £900 better off. But what does that statistic actually mean? Is that an average across all households in all wage brackets? So large increases at the top end can completely wipe out any gains at the lower end (1 person gains £10000 in income, 1 person loses 3000 in income, on average those two people are gaining 3500 in income). Surely this is also not region specific so many areas are probably seeing massive losses, especially more poor regions?

null,false,onedayillwriteabook,flair2,,null,"&gt; We shouldnt gage him on what his ceiling is, just that he is doing well this season. In fact one of out most important players.

This thread is specifically talking about his ceiling so what did you expect? Either way, I don't think he's been anything more than average this season, so in terms of the future I'm going to be more critical. 

&gt; He has had good performances where people say ""oh he played well"" and some bad performance, like everyone else in the team, where people suddenly say ""hes not good enough, full stop""

I've said it elsewhere- he's not good enough defensively. In home games (more often where you'll see he's praised) he gets away with it because we're at home, dictating the midfield is a part and parcel of games at WHL. But away from home his shortcomings (ie not good enough defensively to be starting, not better than bentaleb/eriksen etc to warrant starting further forward) are made clear which is where he is criticised.. I can't speak for how over the top the criticism is but it's logical. Plus, y'know.. football fans in being fickle shocker. Walker was getting 7s for a poor game against QPR. Does the same against Utd where we lose, lo and behold he's getting 1s and 2s. 

&gt; Not sure what youre getting at here.

Comparing him to Parker in that they're both playing that hatchetman role and are both quite easily replaceable (although Mason is far more technically gifted than Scotty P) 

&gt; If mason ends up playing 5-10 years in the side and we dont win anything, i wont give a fuck. i dont give a fuck about success.

Let's not forego the entire reason we both support Tottenham (to see them win) for the sake of your argument in support of a very middle of the road player just because he came through the ranks. You did it earlier in saying he's been one of the most important players for us this season &amp; I let it slide but here I can't. 

I get it, it's nice to have a success story where academy graduates are concerned. I was raised by it- hell, our most successful teams were built on players that had come through the ranks. HOWEVER, just because a) he has done so and b) we haven't had such an influx of academy players in the First XI in a while doesn't immediately make him indispensable. I think the b) point is big here too, people are so unwilling to accept that he should be dropped at times because it's nice to hear from the media/pundits etc how we're playing with academy players, that we didn't buy any wins etc etc. 

&gt; Im not saying his spot shouldnt be challenged, but why do we need to find someone better?

Well, again, two reasons: because he isn't THAT good and because I want to see us challenge. Plus it could have the Davies/Rose affect in that if we bring someone in the healthy competition for a starting job could raise his game. If it does and he gets better, great, as you were. If not, well then that's fine because we have a better player that can start and a competent back up on the bench who you know will give it 100%. (ftr, signing someone doesn't immediately make them a mercenary, I'm not saying we should go out and buy the best guy demanding £100k p/w)

&gt; This, i just dont understand. How can you say that?

Because I've seen it happen to players before. Do you remember how much of a fan favourite Johnnie Jackson was? No one was lamenting his departure from the first team because it improved us, which is what will happen when Mason in inevitably given a more rotational role, probably mainly for home games.

For official categorisation, ""ethnic group"" is used instead, for censuses, rather than race so much because it doesn't make sense for the reason I said above.

null,false,drbummington,eng-lestershire,Leicestershire,null,"1) I think it's been hindered by austerity because our economy was showing improvement (growing GDP etc) then the 2011 budget hit, and instant stagnation. Comparison with other european countries is pretty irrelevant because they're different countries, and there's host of other factors and they were also following austere regimes, so would also suffer similarly. The fact remains we've suffered the slowest recovery since with 18th century, doesn't sound like the mark of a great chancellor.
2) I said that unemployment was lowered, but those figures are massaged because that includes people who've been sanctioned, as well as those who are being forced into unpaid work to maintain their benefits payment. My point about menial jobs is it's not really that great shakes if unemployment is down if everyone's got worse jobs. There's been no real increase in employment, just a big increase in self-employment. Everyone being forced into taxi-driving is hardly the big recovery that gets harped on about. I'd prefer people had menial jobs to no jobs, but when people's wages are only just reaching the level they were in pre-crash it's not a recovery.
3. All your comparisons to Labour are irrelevant, I don't advocate what they did anyway. But from what you've posted what I can see is Gordon Brown kept things roughly breaking even when you take the surplus years into account, maybe slightly into deficit in total, but roughly around the same as the previous tory governments. It was only under Alastair Darling that it took a huge dip, and to be fair he had the global economic crash, so hardly his fault. To say Osborne is doing a better job than Brown is nonsense, at points Brown was reducing the deficit by similar amounts and he as far as I can tell wasn't focussing his entire roll as chancellor on doing so. (Constantly selling off profitable government owned assets, eurostar and the like, seem especially fucking stupid when you want to reduce the deficit)
I call out the massive increase in debt, because the tories keep banging on about how they're paying back our debts, when frankly they're not at all. That kind of bullshit is inexcusable.
Cherry picking a few taxes that seem to be hitting the rich rather than the poor clearly isn't showing the full picture. 20% VAT for one is regressive, and cutting benefits disproportionately affects the poorest. Continued use of quantitative easing also benefits the rich etc. The fact of the matter is the gulf between rich and poor is widening at a faster rate under this government, which to me suggests that the rich are getting rich, and the poor are getting poorer. Top earners are seeing increases in wages and bonuses, while everyone elses wages stagnate or fall in real terms. So yes, the recovery is just for the rich. 90% of tax paid for by top 50% seems more than reasonable, because I imagine they have more than 90% of the nations total wealth.
So yes, I don't think George Osborne's been a particularly good chancellor, but that's not the reason to say fuck the tories. You can say that because of their welfare reforms that are leaving people literally starving to death, their ideological desire to privatise everything, that's resulting in more money being spent so shambolic tax avoiding companies can do a shit job and their demonisation of the working glass as benefits scroungers who are fucking over our budget, when in reality, if we just got our large businesses to actually pay the taxes they owe we'd be in much better shape (but they're Osborne's rich mates). Fuck the tories, they're the worst of a fucking terrible bunch.

You're advocating semi-strong EMH, which implies all public information is priced in.  This implies nobody can obtain a return different from anybody else because all have the same level of information.  This is demonstrably false - look at the various returns different investors have.

Also, EMH relies on rational agents - and even if you believe agents are rational (they're clearly not, given the existence of flash crashes, bubbles, general mania, despair etc. that permeate markets at various times) you can't avoid the fact that the whole concept of rational is absurd.  What's rational for me with an investment time horizon of A and a Tax rate of B is completely different to what's rational behaviour for you with horizon X and tax rate Y.  So pricing disparities can and do occur - fund managers window dress at year end, people cycle losses into taxes, dumb money (including passive index trackers) buy shares as they become more expensive and sell them as they become cheaper.  All of this is seen on a daily basis.

In the longer term, however, prices do tend to revert to some sort of more rational (earnings-driven) level, and that is a form of efficiency.  But that in no sense implies you can't profit of the absence of short term rationality.
