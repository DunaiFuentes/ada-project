Geri looked like a great threat and one of the only threats in that half. Kone was very poor and I wish we could just ship him off as it's clear he's not anywhere near good enough. Other than that just a bit of rustiness from everyone but aside from that it was alright. Thought Galloway and Browning done well all game. 


Second half was immediately different and showed how influential Mirallas and Rom are for us. They were great throughout and I know it's low opposition but it looks like Roms all around game has improved massively. Special mention has to be given to I think everyone's MOTM Conor McAleny. He was absolutely fantastic and he was involved in every goal. Could this be the season he could break into the first team? We'll see by all accounts he done well at Cardiff so maybe he's discovered his form. Hopefully if he does stay and improve he'll play as a striker and not an attacking midfielder because if he did play as a striker he could perhaps make a claim for second choice if he performs enough. 


Anyway just a short one from me today. Though Geri was great if not a bit raw. Cleverley was alright too exactly what I expected just a normal good player to have. Definitively see him as ahead of Barry anyway so that's a good thing. Conor Mc looked very promising as did Jonjoe Kenny although he's years away from the first team. Hopefully Mo is alright though we don't need players getting injured in pre season especially when it's a player like Mo who'll be out to prove why he should be a regular starter.

EIRE, often referred to as the Republic of Ireland in those days, was at least somewhat sympathetic to the republicans, but they couldn't actively support them because they couldn't afford to piss off the British government or be seen to be sponsoring terrorism.

Again, if neither Muslim nor non-Muslim 80-year-old women living in Aberystwyth have any history of this offence, the statement that the Muslim group is more likely to commit the crime than the non-Muslim group is not supported by the evidence. There is considerably more to someone's character than their religious identity.

&gt;I don't see it as reducing to someones character (gender isn't a character)

Of course gender is a character trait; don't you know what masculinity and femininity are?

&gt;or predicting area's of risk, I see it as an issue to tackle, both for men in general and muslim men for whatever the cause is there.

Then it helps to identify the actual causes of someone entering child sex rings, which are evidently more than simply identifying as Muslim.

Because people criticised christianity for its ridiculousness, its savage outdated ideas, its inconsistant logic and silly fairy tales, then they drew silly comics about it and took its power away by becoming more secular.

With Islam, nobody seems to have this intention at all, any critcism is deemed islamophobia, cartoons are met with murder and laws are changed to accomodate islam rather than the other way round.

It may be stupid... but it was your stupid idea!  I'm literally playing along with your ""stupid"" hypothetical situations and you're calling me stupid for considering it!?

So explain to me how one person can be that oblivious and contradictory while still having the wherewithal to maintain a relatively independent existence?

&gt;What? that's bizarre, of course it made a difference.

The vote was won by more than 7, therefore the net 7 yes votes provided by the Lib Dems didn't swing it!  How is that bizarre?  That's maths.

&gt;Stop pulling things out of your arse, the vote was 323 to 302..

Again, how are you capable of existing without help?  I'm aware what the vote was.  My numbers, as I clearly explained,  were the vote without counting the Lib Dems, which pretty clearly demonstrates that without them, it would still have passed.  Your ""stupid"" hypothetical needs some arithmetic, not just reading numbers!

&gt;If they'd voted against it wouldn't have gone through, if they'd abstained it wouldn't have gone through,

I thought hypothetical scenarios were ""stupid""?!  

If we're holding the Lib Dems to their manifestos, then why not do the same for the Conservatives?  If the Conservatives who rebelled had voted the way they said they would, it would be a majority of 33! So was it the Conservative rebels who really swung it?

In terms of type of player, I truly do think Pochettino wants two players who can make a significant impact on both sides of the ball. Consistently playing Bentaleb as the more defensive minded CM may have been a result of Mason's relative lack of defensive focus, but his refusal to really give meaningful minutes to other CMs makes me think he didn't want a one dimensional player there. So basically we want another Bentaleb. Someone who is smart with the ball, and talented enough to both pick out a decent pass going forward and cover space and win the ball back defensively. They also need to be able to cover a lot of ground. But it has to be the right ground at the right time. Mason has the energy and ability to be this player, but he needs to focus his defensive work and pick his moments to press and attack better. Maybe Alli can grow into the role, and maybe Carroll can find some defensive ability. Maybe Mousa cam transition to a more defensive role himself. He's certainly got the strength to do it. He's physically suited, and his more cautious passing tendencies might be better for a more reserved role. In all sincerity, I think Paulinho might have been our best option. I don't think he deserved all the criticism he got. In any case, we need to bring someone in in my opinion. We can't rely on what we've got, even if Mason steps up. I don't think we have the depth to really handle all four competitions. So yeah, that didn't really.answer your question. But it's about all I've got.

We can certainly disregard any conclusions based on a bivariate analysis of a clearly multifaceted topic. The fact is that there are Muslims who are involved in child sex rings and there are Muslims who are not involved in child sex rings. Therefore, there is a factor that separates these two groups, so suggesting that all Muslims are equally likely to be involved in this is simply not an accurate characterisation of the issue.

&gt;what is your explaination that more muslim men rape than non muslims out of curiousity?

I haven't looked into the sociology of this issue enough to know the causes, but the existence of Muslims who are not involved shows that it is more complicated than that.

&gt;I know that their are masculine women and effeminate men, and gender identity and gender expression are two very different things.

Like religious identity and religious expression are two very different things? Hm. In this case, my point was that the manifestation of their male identity was influential here, but this does not imply all other self-identified males share this manifestation and/or intend to commit similar acts.

I've talked to accountants who report that its ok but a bit dull, corporate lawyers who find the work soul destroying and I've yet to meet a happy teacher.

In fact my suspicion is that careers were invented by companies to make you willing to sacrifice your personal life for to work harder for the company.

So bearing that in mind, I would try and focus on jobs that provide enjoyment now and not worry too much about a career. It also sound like you've got the opportunity to try different things and fail as you'll be no worse of than you are now. You might also find that your parents are happier to have you around when they see you out and about trying to work.

As for what specifically to do, I've no great ideas. I'd be tempted to try running my own business rather than being an employee, even if its only being a suby for local builders whilst you work things out.

One final point: your life has not been wasted. Life isn't a competition to see who has the most toys by the time they retire. Focus on now, as its much more important than worrying about what sort of career you will have had by he time you retire.

&gt; Their gene pool is pretty fucked up too.

BBC News:

&gt; It is estimated that at least 55% of British Pakistanis are married to first cousins and the tradition is also common among some other South Asian communities and in some Middle Eastern countries.

&gt; But there is a problem: marrying someone who is themselves a close family member carries a risk for children - a risk that lies within the code of life; within our genes. 

[source](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4442010.stm)

Professor Steve Jones  (Renowned Geneticist): 

&gt; “Bradford is very inbred. There is a huge amount of cousins marrying each other there.” Research in Bradford has found that babies born to Pakistani women are twice as likely to die in their first year as babies born to white mothers, with genetic problems linked to inbreeding identified as a “significant” cause. 

[source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/8544359/Hay-Festival-2011-Professor-risks-political-storm-over-Muslim-inbreeding.html)

How is your blanket statement 'a load of racists' standing up now? Is being politically correct more important then the serious issues there are within the Pakistani community having a high populace of children with serious physical and mental issues as a result of inbreeding? These children are part of the next generation to care for this country. Should we let them be born retarded, because it might be racist to try and address the issue?

Is being politically correct more important to you, then children being targeted for abuse based on their race? Why are you not raising this as a racist attack? Not just a generalization made on a web forum, but people physically abusing children and seeing it as ok, based on their skin color?

While on the topic... do you think holding derogatory views of women and homosexuals should not be challenged, and challenged directly wherever that exists? Or would it be too uncomfortable, if they are not the right color?

Having said that, his performance against City shows that given the right platform, he can boss one of the best mid-fields in the league. 

He's also always up for a scrap, and despite often being dropped, has never made any kind of complaint. He's the perfect squad player imo.

    The lib dems who changed their mind and voted for rather than against are the people who swung the vote.

I.E. ""they"" in the sentence you quoted is the group of liberal democrats who went back on the promise, not the entire party. 

&gt;and ""In fact, even if every lib dem who renegged had just abstained from voting, it would not have passed.""

not sure what part of that is hard to understand. If every lib dem had kept their pledge of not actively supporting the legislation, the vote would not have passed. They actually pledged to actively oppose it so strictly speaking, even the MPs who abstained broke the promise. 


&gt;and you're calling me stupid for considering it!?  

#
I didn't insult you, I insulted the argument. Big difference.

&gt;My numbers, as I clearly explained, were the vote without counting the Lib Dems, which pretty clearly demonstrates that without them, it would still have passed. 

which is, like I said, completely unconnected to reality since the Lib dems exist. The issue people have is not that liberal democrats have corporeal form on earth,  it's that every sitting lib dem pledged they would oppose the legislation, then the entire party leadership and over half of the party overall decided to go against that. 

&gt;If we're holding the Lib Dems to their manifestos, then why not do the same for the Conservatives?

why change the subject? We're talking about the lib dems, not the conservatives. The conservatives didn't win a large number of younger voters over by pledging to oppose fee increases then going ahead with it anyway, they were always pretty clear on this.

Gareth Bale, just like Walcott and OX, was obviously going to leave a Championship club anyway. It is not like we should hate Real Madrid for buying Modric...it is just football.

If every lib dem had kept their pledge of not actively supporting the legislation, the vote would not have passed. They actually pledged to actively oppose it so strictly speaking, even the MPs who abstained broke the promise.

They did, but that was never in contention.

&gt;I didn't insult you, I insulted the argument. Big difference.

You can refute an argument without using the word 'stupid'.  'Stupid' can only describe a person.

""adjective (stupider, stupidest)
lacking intelligence or common sense""

That's not a description of an argument!

An argument can be flawed, inconsistent, contradictory, invalid, unsound...

&gt;The conservatives didn't win a large number of younger voters over by pledging to oppose fee increases then going ahead with it anyway, they were always pretty clear on this.

The Conservatives may have won older (and possibly younger) voters over by promising to implement the Browne Review and increase the tuition fee cap while increasing the salary level at which fees must be paid back.  I don't see why some hypotheticals are OK and some are stupid.  I'm not changing the subject, I'm just pointing out that in any close vote you can just as easily blame any group of MPs for swinging the vote.

&gt;which is, like I said, completely unconnected to reality since the Lib dems exist.

The question is not one of existence, stop being disingenuous.  It was about abstaining.  You can maintain corporeal existence whilst still abstaining, and had the Lib Dems done that, their votes would have made no difference, but if you *really* want to get existential, then I suppose you could hand every Lib Dem seat over to the party who came second in the constituency, and then you'd get a Conservative majority anyway, or the 2015 General Election as it's otherwise known!

They went back on their promise and they obliterated and embittered that support base in the process.

null,false,Asgand,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire,null,"A good way to check your BT Broadband performance is actually using BT's official tester that they don't advertise or use on their main website. 

Go to:

http://speedtest.btwholesale.com/

1) Do all of the required steps before running the test. It doesn't necessarily have to be via a wired Ethernet connection. However if you run it via Wireless you have to accept this will result in reduced speeds compared to a wired connection. 

2) When the initial test is complete choose 'Further Diagnostics'. It will then ask for your landline number if your connection is Fibre To The Cabinet or postcode details if Fibre To The Premises. Most if not all BT private home connections are Fibre To The Cabinet. 

3) It will show you the maximum achievable speed of your line and the performance at time of test. There is a leeway of 'acceptable' speeds below the maximum. If it falls within this leeway there is nothing you can do. It is about 10/20mbs on either side of the acceptable level. If you're on a 30 MB line and getting 10MB that may very well be considered acceptable.

4) If the speed falls below the minimum acceptable level it will show you on this diagnostic test. I recommend a print screen/screen capture from various times of day. Morning, Daytime and Evening over the course of a week. You then have a case for action if the minimum level is regularly not met. Call BT and say you are not receiving the minimum acceptable standards that they themselves set. You can then go to the BT Customer Care forums or call them and they can perform fault checks on your line or send an engineer out.

Worth Checking First:

- Are you using a BT Home Hub? If so is it the latest BT Home Hub 5? Older BT modems are considerably poorer quality. Upgrade first. Are you using an older BT modem that requires the white OpenReach modem to be plugged in to the main modem?

- Check the cabling from the point of entry into the property and to the modem. Ensure there are no frays or damage to the cables and that everything is plugged in correctly. 

- Have you logged into your modem/router via your Web Browser and changed the Wireless Channel? BT modems and others broadcast over certain channels. They may be broadcasting on the same channel as nearby wireless equipment that is interfering (phones, laptops, etc). Change the channel to Auto which chooses the best one or try different channels and check performance.

- If using Wireless on a PC ensure you have a decent Wireless Adapter using the latest technology. Alternatively use a Wired Connection. 

- If FTTC identify how your internal cabling connects to the external cable. Is it underground or via a telegraph pole? Trace it back if possible to the green cabinet out in the street and check it for damage/tampering. If it looks ok externally call BT and request an engineer to inspect it and all associated telegraph poles/copper wiring. Remember that if your green cabinet is ages away this will impact your speed. I'm on a BT 75mb line and received 65 as I tested it just now. However my green cabinet is in my street. People 2 or 3 streets away connect to this cabinet and the distance is made up mainly of copper wires and not fibre.

Glad to hear you're avoiding the big 5 bandwagon clubs. A big-money club like Man City that's buying titles every year can only meet your expectations or disappoint you, but a mid-money club like Everton can shock you for the better. After all our listless draws and losses to clubs we should be beating, moments like [Jagielka's equalizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_q8wWBoGvs) or totally dominating Man U feel so much sweeter.

Everton has some great history. We and Aston Villa are the only two founding members of the league to still be in the top flight, and they were very nearly relegated this year. Goodison Park is significantly older than any stadium we have in the US, and the Grand Old Team song they play after games is the funnest kind of kitschy.

More importantly, the team is a lot of fun to watch. We've got a core of young, high-energy, freakishly talented players (Lukaku, Deulofeu, Besic, Barkley, McCarthy) that can be a ton of fun to watch. We're one of the few Premiere League teams who don't just park the bus and play defense-only, which gets old very fast. Plus, our guys don't dive.

I live on the West Coast and voluntarily wake up at 4am to watch Everton games because they're just a ton of fun. Get on the hype train, you'll like it (and if you don't you can just quietly change your allegiance without telling anyone).",null,0,null,1436637469,null,0,false,0,cszv93p,null,t3_3cx9bi,null,t1_cszv93p,null,t3_3cx9bi,null,null,null,1437774718,null,14,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,14,null

No. People save money in banks and the banks then lend out multiples of the money saved. The only way to take money out of existence (and reduce GDP) is to pay off debt which people are not doing. People are taking out record amounts of debt to fund their lifestyles, this has been increasing for the past couple of years. 

Private banks always win by charging interest on money they lend. Government policy is geared towards ensuring this status quo does not change.

&gt;However, if the public isn't as clearly aware that their income has been reduced they will continue to spend as if it weren't.

The vast majority of the public spend 100% of their income each month. They live pay check to pay check and have no choice either way.

It is not a healthy response to hate your job so much that you just stop going until they sack you. Hating your job is more common (though always a shame) but being proactive about finding alternative while in work is healthier approach. 

You do still have options, loads of them. Get yourself down to a local volunteering centre and try some things out, build up your range of experience but also your self worth and confidence. 

I have a friend who started his own gardening business 3 years ago and now needs to hire in help to get all of his work complete. That's a good physical job, he gets to meet lots of people and help them out and he didn't need to train for it. 

What do you think about working with people? A support role? In school, or college? 
What about working in an admin role in an institution/organisation you respect? Maybe it will lead into things you can't imagine just now?

So I went on to arxiv and picked the first physics paper at random (do feel free to do the same), and here is the one I got:

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02509.pdf

Entropic Fluid Dynamics! It doesn't get more exciting than this :) So look through the paper and look at when it makes a claim in a sentence. Take this early one:

&gt; By employing a system of discrete kinetic equations rather than solving directly the macroscopic flow equations it has shown its potential in a wide range of applications, from turbulence  phenomena [6, 11] to flows at a micron scale [2] and multiphase flows [33], to relativistic hydrodynamics [27], soft-glassy systems [5] and beyond.

You'll notice the numbers it uses are the citations to back up each claim as it is being said. Scientific papers do this because, well, that is how you are taught to do it. It makes it clear to any reader why you hold an opinion you do, because each of your opinions are directly sourced at the time you make the claim.

The vet article linked does not do that. This is a HUGE red flag. If you don't back up each claim as you are saying it then how do I know whether what you are saying is true? Do I have to read every single citation to ensure that every single claim you make is correct? Someone without a scientific background might not know the importance of in line citations, and would be happy to write an article like that.

I tried to find a bio one as well, and got this at random:

That's one hell of a claim. Charities have existed in the UK since the Victorian era. There have absolutely been a huge impact in many areas, polio has been cured, species have been saved, child mortality has slashed in many countries, landmines have been removed, a tonne of stuff. And that forgets that a lot of charity isn't there to do much more than provide relief, whether that is supporting blind people, supplying food through food banks, providing a safe space for domestic violence victims - these are ongoing problems with structural causes beyond the remit of charities to solve, they often treat the symptoms. 

As for foreign aid, that is mostly routed through governments so charities aren't responsible for a lot of it. And if you look at how it really works these things are often not gifts, they are given to buy equipment from donor companies or require countries to open up their markets or privatise assets, often screwing them up more than helping. 

There are crap charities, just like there are crap organisations of every type, but it is a bit much to suggest nothing has been achieved overall.

His bigest weakness defensively in our league is how easily he's targeted on long balls. Standard tactics of half the teams in the english league is to pump long balls in front of the centre halves for flick ons or hold up play. Allen is powerless against this, good defensively on the floor but particularly at away grounds he gets dominated in the air. Compared to Lucas who is *outstanding* in the air this is a big weakness and was a big problem in the first half of 2013 when he played as the deepest midfielder.

And he's just too slow in his decision-making in the final third, doesnt see passes quick enough, doesnt play through balls, doesn't shoot well.

That makes it hard to fit into a midfield two. In  a three, he definitely has a role but if we play a midfield three it becomes trickier to fit Coutinho in. I do see him very much as a squad player and a someone who can come on in place of a more creative type if we are looking to control a game.",null,0,null,1436641276,null,0,false,0,cszx6h8,null,t3_3cx9s6,null,t1_cszx6h8,null,t3_3cx9s6,null,null,null,1437776319,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

McCarthy and Barkley the deep two, with Peanuts left, Naismith central and Deulofeu on the right in that sort of 'right-of-centre' advanced position Roberto likes to use which almost makes him a secondary striker. Arouna Kone was the centre forward.

The second half was tougher to follow as the game became disjointed, but on a positive side we looked more fluid and promisingly fluent with the ball under pressure.

4-2-3-1 again though ultimately, with Robles taking over in goal, Hibbert coming in at right back and Gaz Baz coming in at the back for Jags. Besic and Cleverly were the deep two (until Mo went off), Mirallas on the left, the game's outstanding player in McAleny through the middle and Neon Leon floating in from the right with Lukaku up front on his own showing some very nice touches and that his link-up play with Mirallas remains easily our most potent combination.

When Besic went off, Jonjoe Kenny came on at right back and there was a bit of a shuffle about with Hibbert coming inside to partner Browning and Barry shifting into the midfield for the last half an hour.

On the subs bench, since everyone present got a game, I'll only comment on the fact that Duncan has had a haircut and still cuts a dashing figure, whilst Bobby wore a white Everton polo shirt, which is probably not available at all good sports stores.

If you open the account through HSBC US, you may have better luck. I also know an expat who opened a Citi account from their original country. However AFAIK they charge quite a high monthly fee for this.

I reckon this may not be ideal, but using a joint account and then use that account history to open a standalone account may be the best bet.

Must be that space-time rift in Cardiff Bay acting up again.

If there was a serious question about foreign or unknown aircraft flying around the airport then I imagine the Ministry of Defence would already know about it. Either Darren Millar's been watching far too much Doctor Who or it's his attempt at slagging off Labour's decision to buy the airport again.

The rate at which this taper used to kick in was about £6500ish pounds. Its now down to £3000ish pounds. So basically for every pound you earn above that mark, 48p of your award is taken off you.

Secondly, a Director of Football does a lot more than just transfers. If Guardiola comes, it will be thanks to him, when the academy starts churning out players it will be thanks to him. 

He's also done better than expected selling players. £25m for Javi and Rodwell was a great bit of business that no one really appreciated, and £25m for Negredo, 12 months after paying £16m was genius. 

Thirdly - Delph apparently had his medical, and was expected at the club to sign and do a media video today. Everything was agreed, and then he backed out at the last minute. You cannot blame that on Txiki. 

Lastly, he's not solely in charge of transfers. As I  understand it he finds targets and convinces players to come, then the financial people hammer out the details. Txiki is not the guy with his hands on the purse strings, that will be Khaldoon or Soriano most likely - if not the Sheikh himself when it comes to a €100m bid for Pogba.

We have a ton of money.

Delph just plain changed his mind when he woke up on the day he was going to sign a contract to leave an almost-every-game-starting captaincy and become just squad depth. It's hard to blame him much for that. 

I don't think when push really really comes to shove later in the window that us and our money will let the difference between 44M and 50M keep us from getting the best young English talent and a player we want. Sterling is all posturing at this point, and even if we ""lose"" the staring contest, we get the player. They just want to have the staring contest a bit longer.

We have the money to make any bid necessary for Pogba. If he decides he's just not leaving, then there's nothing else we could have done, and we will seek a CM improvement elsewhere.

We haven't heard anything about KDB since he supposedly went in to hear Wolfsburg's offer, but his not yet signing it means he is still in play. 

It looks like we've got a young fullback ready to go and are waiting for him to finish his holiday before announcing it. 

We've got enough home grown youth to promote in a serious pinch to make quota.

The rules as they are currently look something like this:

1. The employer must be registered to apply for visas, and only certain employers who can demonstrate a need for overseas workers are allowed to register.
1. If the employer can register they must advertise the job throughout the entire EU and they must demonstrate that they couldn't find anyone suitable to do the job.
1. If the employer meets both of the above conditions then they can apply for one of a very small number of visas that get snapped up very quickly on release.

Really?

Poverty is defined as =&lt;60% of median income. Median income is defined as the point where half of people are below and half are above. If all the people who are below that point (i.e half of the people) are above 60% of that point, there is no poverty. The median does not change, because it's still the point where half of the people are below and half are above, but there is no poverty.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to walk you through Year 9 maths.

EDIT: Just thought I'd add an example with a small section of 10 people:

£5, £7, £7, £9, £9, £11, £11, £16, £17, £17

The median income here is £10, as there are 5 people above it and 5 people below it. 60% of £10 is £6, which would be the poverty line in this case. From the example, the one person on £5 is in poverty.

£7, £7, £7, £9, £9, £11, £11, £16, £17, £17

In this example, the median is still £10, with 5 people above it and 5 people below it. Poverty line, therefore, also remains the same. The only difference is that nobody is below it.

In this dark comedy, the crotchety Willie T. Stokes (Billy Bob Thornton) and his partner (Tony Cox) reunite once a year for a holiday con. Posing as a mall Santa and his elf, they rip off shopping outlets on Christmas Eve. This year, however, Willie is falling apart. He's depressed and alcoholic, and his erratic behavior draws the suspicion of mall security (Bernie Mac). But when befriending a small boy brings out his kinder side, Willie begins to wonder if there is still some hope for him.

That aside, I think technically he's way above average, and he makes it looks so sleek too. His turns and touches (with either foot) are magical. I wish he played more minutes and was injured less, as I think with more time on the pitch he could show us a lot more of that side of him.

As for performances, he can often disappear from games, however I feel like this is also due to the way we are set up - he seems to thrive on being forward rather than further back up the pitch, and we lacked pressing and movement so much last season.

His best game by a country mile was against Swansea. IIRC, this was the one where he scored that bamboozling rebound goal when pressing the keeper, and his second where he just ran through the whole box and slotted it calmly home was one of the smoothest and most confident runs I've seen from a Liverpool player in recent memory.

Anyway I agree with you about the pogba briefing being a tactic rather than us pulling out, but at the same time it was a stupid tactic. Sure it might make juve think the deals off, but what about liverpool and wolfsburg? they would think we aren't going to be spending 70m now so they can stick to their valuations of sterling and KDB.

The fact is it a double edged sword and we've been so quiet on everything else makes me think it wasn't a tactic, rather a genuine leak from the club.

He's better than Navas yes, but that's about it. 

If we can get KdB alongside him I'll be very happy, immense player who can really make a difference for us, if we're not getting Pogba we should just match Wolfsburg's asking price and get it done, best transfer we can possibly make imo.

Pogba was always going to be very hard to get so I'm not too dissapointed if we miss out on him, I'm mostly dissapointed at our inability to properly plan our alternatives to him or the fact that we didn't back out earlier when Juve made their demands, at this moment our best bet looks like Xhaka, and while he isn't bad by any means I'd have prefered Kondogbia or Schneiderlin.",null,0,null,1436649378,null,0,1436649635,0,ct017rk,null,t3_3cxvt8,null,t1_ct017rk,null,t3_3cxvt8,null,null,null,1437779190,null,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2,null

No. We're stuck with this because:

 * The Lib Dems didn't really get enough of their policies through to justify enabling what was essentially a Conservative government. Their track record really isn't much to boast about [1](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-liberal-democrats/20493), [2](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/have-the-lib-dems-kept-their-promises/5980).

 * In the 2010 election they presented themselves as a new alternative and the champions of those disillusioned with politics. Their performance in government suggests they're not so radically different from Labour or the Tories. A vote in 2015 was a vote for a Conservative government anyway, it was in the best interests of Lib Dem voters who didn't like the Tories to vote Labour (or some other opposition party).

 * People jumped ship from Lib Dem to either Tory or Labour. People were jumping from Tory and Labour to UKIP. They may have only got one seat, but our retarded voting system means that they will have cost the opposition a good number of seats. 

 * The SNP mopped the floor with Labour in Scotland. This in itself isn't a problem, because they were happy to have an informal arrangement to keep the Tories out of power. The problem is that people in England knew it was coming and were appalled by the idea that Scottish people could end up having any influence at all over the government of the whole island. 

The issue I take with the argument presented above is that the Lib Dems were supposed to block illiberal legislation. I would expect nothing less of them. The truth is that they didn't need to be in government to do that, they could have done that equally as well as an opposition party. In fact, if they had done that, they wouldn't have sowed so much disillusionment among their new-found supporters and they might have had decent numbers this time.

I think it's amazing how he remembers where he came from and hasn't let his success go to his head and become too big for his boots- see: clyne and sterling, although they weren't non league they still rose in the game very quickly. 
I was having a discussion with some friends a few days ago and it was about if rickie lambert had stayed at Southampton he'd be one of the best strikers in the league last season, and I'm glad Austin isn't making that same mistake of being number 2 at a top club.  
Also,  I find it incredibly admirable that he doesn't mind sacrificing his international career for us, however I believe that if we stayed up instead of Leicester he would have got the cap instead of vardy. 
The fact that he will stay until told otherwise suggests to me that we can scrap that asking price and reject all bids for him. The only thing I fear is that we lose him next season when his contract is up,  so les better start acting fast. 
I know the term ""legend"" has been used very loosely lately, but the fact that he sticks with us despite clearly deserving more,  shows signs of this,  I'm willing to say now that he is at least an club icon.  
I know that was a bit long - winded so, tl;dr: charlie is a great example for the game, as well as being a future club legend,  if he isn't already.

* Jeremy Corbyn: Can do no wrong in front of this crowd, practically gets a standing ovation for turning up late. Seems to have toned down some of the hard left rhetoric since the last time I saw him speak (at the televised hustings last month). Spoke plainly and answered all the questions honestly.
* Liz Kendall: Also did a good job of answering the question put to her rather than the one in her head, much better than last time, and better than the other two candidates. I get the feeling she's less experienced at public speaking than the others, hence her tendency to run on. Despite that, I think she made her case very clearly. I don't think she's trying to reframe the debate in order to attack the other candidates; she genuinely believes that being electable is the most important thing.
* Andy Burnham: Very passionate, dedicated, heart is clearly in the right place. Unfortunately his answers lacked substance and often didn't address the question fully. It's a shame that he didn't come across well (at least to me) in front of just about the friendliest audience possible. I think he's a great spokesman for the party but not the leader we need. (All that said, I did like his proposal to formally combine health and social care into a single body).
* Yvette Cooper: I'm having tremendous difficulty summoning an opinion on her. Sorry. That probably says enough in itself.

I missed the deputy leader's questions as I went to meeting/debate with Liz Kendall. Is there any way to watch those online or read the minutes? I'll probably vote for Tom Watson anyway, if only for the inevitable Tom and Jerry jokes if Jeremy Corbyn also wins ;)

We don't?

There are plenty of us on both sides of every debate. We discuss demographics and sure, some of the negative implications of our current immigration policies (too much labour; welfare abuse; burden on infrastructure; nationalistic; crime), but we also acknowledge the positive side as well (replenishing skill shortages; aiding asylum seekers; cheap holidays). Saying ""immigrants"" is making it personal. ""Immigration"" would be more appropriate and we, not even all of us at that (where would be the discussion?), blame it for some issues, not all.

We don't blame religions. We may blame religious demographics though. We bring in demography and socioeconomics, which is where this sometimesoffashitty sub and  /r/ukpolitics differ. Look at this thread for example. You lot talk about Muslims. We talk about Muslim demographics, Quranic scripture and Islam as a category of interpretations. We, in relation to the article, acknowledge that *Rotherham* consists of a Pakistani Muslim demographic. We don't, however, say that all Pakistanis and Muslims are a part of systematic child grooming cult. We discuss, bar our little boys and girls, what's attracting them whether it be poor politics, holy books, the complications of multiculturalism and/or momentum. It is kind of like the anti UKIP vibe around here. We understand that there's a population of bigots, despite how small it is, but we also understand that there are plenty of legitimate and bigger concerns which would be dealt with by UKIP. PC dipshitism is one of them. 

We understand that life is complex. We do not simplify, polarise and frame malice like the seemingly majority of this forum. I bet the mods get depressed when they see some of the prejudice, intolerance and double standard rife pricks their content attracts. Debates for most of you are always *this* or *that* or *us* versus *them*. There's never any compromise. It is always *good* versus *evil* and *my moral supremacy wipes and should wipe yours*. I believe one describes it as acting *holier than thou*. Why can't some just understand that opinions can differ without one being wrong or better? That's tolerance. That's the concept your self soothing PC downvote brigade don't understand. People use to welcome outsider thought. You lot just censor it with hate, abuse of authority, a bad karma score and moral judgement.

I have, over time, been trying to dismantle some of the prejudice around here and, of course, I will continue to do so, continue to try.

Before you try the *yeah butz iv seen dem rscistz ovather*, I will hereby acknowledge that there are some ""racist"" demographics at  /r/ukpolitics. It is just a lot *lot* smaller. Despite our tolerance (not respect) of such opinions (it isn't an exactly rub each other place of bigotry).

Hopefully that won't happen in the current season. He's got competition but I think he'll be more ready than Firmino, he's already played in the Premier League and he's more experienced, so he'll get his chances. It's now up to him, to show us that he's quality. (I definitely think he is, but he needs to prove it) 

Moreover, we will hopefully rotate a lot, so he'll be one the main squad rotation players. This season is crucial for him. If he does well, he'll stay. If he doesn't, he won't. Simple as that.

Personally, I wish him the best. I believe in him, as most of the people of this subreddit do, and I do believe he will be one of our best players this season.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"Putting on my amateur Internet psychologist hat, it sounds like you were using materialistic things as a crutch to get approval and validation from others, more than enjoying them for themselves. First, you need to value yourself. Improve yourself. Get fit(ter). Drop bad habits. Learn. Develop your self-discipline/self-mastery. Make small changes, slowly. When you fall off the waggon (whichever waggon it is), get back on and ratchet your progress forward. Help others. You're not hard-wired for anything, but changing attitudes/habits/perceptions is hard and takes time and effort.

Become more goal-oriented. Have written goals, and explicitly relate the things you do or put effort/time/resources to them. This can help you stop caring about impressing people (except when actually you need to for some reason).

It sounds like success with women was also a matter of validation. Maybe don't date for a while, anyway. Many women are attracted to financial success (or the trappings of it). Do you really want to be wanted for the resources you can provide? ""What can you do for me - today?"" Do you really want to play that game?

Remember, what you see on social media is the highlight reel, often with heavy editing. You can't know if those people are happy. Having said that...

&gt; Why am I so unlucky?

Well, you had a good income (apparently) and instead of saving/investing and planning for contingencies, you got into debt and got fired (don't know if you had any influence over that or if you just mean laid off) while not in a position to handle it. This wasn't bad luck. Losing your job happens, and should be planned for. This was bad planning.

You're a citizen of a first-world nation with an education and in the age of massively democratised access to information. Get a job, even a crappy one if it'll enable you to save some money. Start saving this money so you can take advantage of a future opportunity - whether that's an interview for a proper job or a venture of your own. Stop focussing on the trappings of success and start focussing on the process of getting there. When you do get there, save up a good stash of money while you can.

Just some context: I earn enough to buy nice car, gadgets, holidays, etc. Though I have spent rather more money on fun stuff in the past, I now live with a parent, take the bus to work and yesterday bought my first smart phone (a reasonably priced mid-range model) having had my previous dumb-phone for more than 5 years. (I do also spend some money on my main hobby, which I enjoy.) I'm stashing money away to become financially independent. This already gives me the security of being able to take a few years off if I wanted or needed to.

This has benefits to your sleeping patterns and certain aspects of your health, has benefits to wildlife, benefits anyone who wishes to view the night sky, and should save councils (and the Highways agency) a bit of money in the long term.

There is some concern about the potential negative effects of blue-rich light from white LEDs (usually cheap ones), which again can be detrimental to both us and wildlife.  There are IDA guidelines which suggest using LEDs which at 3000K or lower and, depending on your region, councils have been relatively good at following the guidelines. 

Some amateur astrophotographers get in a huff about them because they can filter sodium and/or mercury lamp light out of their one shot colour images. But then amateur astrophotographers always seem find something to get in a huff about, so it's best just to let them get on with their business.

In other regions, non-essential street lights are being turned off after midnight. This also makes an amazing difference. All-night streetlighting is a relatively recent notion in the UK where until the late-70s streetlights were often only used during the twilight hours. Those areas which have recently turned them off have interestingly seen positive changes in crime rates - the light appears to give people a false sense of security.

null,false,TVKMarkII,null,null,null,"The basic principle is almost all resources are scarce, therefore supply decreases over time. If demand is stable (it's not) then the price for these resources will increase as the supply decreases, because there's less of it to go round.

Inflation is necessary as it encourages the consumer to purchase now (thus stimulating the economy) rather than delaying the purchase while waiting for the price to drop (which means the economy could go lax due to a lack of demand and monetary circulation).

Technology now plays a massive part and can affect it either way. The mass production of products can push the price down as supply can be increased quickly. However it can equally produce very high-tech things that are harder to mass produce but are in greater demand. The former will drag prices down at the lower end of the market, while the latter will push it up at the top end because demand is constant.!

But I think in all honesty the price brackets remain roughly the same (adjusted for inflation). The top of the range computers are £1,000+. Mid-range is £500-1000. Low spec are less than £500. But technology has simply moved on so the prices reflect that change (it would be rather silly to continue charging someone £1000 for a computer that isn't even on the same generational level as another, it wouldn't sell). Simply technology has moved on. 

If you look at things less affected by cutting edge technology, say; petrol: the price has risen 50% since I can clearly remember it. A lot of the more ""basic"" products have risen in price while technological products have fallen, because the basic products are growing more scarce, while the technology ones are more powerful but using the same production techniques (roughly) so they reflect better value for money. 

The other thing you have to consider is the relative prices. Which again works both ways. ",null,0,null,1436663466,null,0,false,0,ct085ky,null,t3_3cyv4o,null,t1_ct085ky,null,t3_3cyv4o,null,null,null,1437783607,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

Immaculate/perfect conditions, got it for myself in Jan. 2015 since I'm a competitive player but since i'm going university later this year and will leave outside i will no longer use it. Everything is in perfect condition and there are NO DAMAGE in the package, nor on the products. Not even a scratch!

It comes with everything provided when buying in store and there's also 1 year FREE warranty from ASTRO, so anything faulty occurs they'll replace it without charge. 

Grab a bargain since in store the price is £250. I will sell it for £205 if you use Paypal or £195 for cash/bank transfer! 

Can meet anywhere in Central London if you do cash on collection.

p.s. Feel free to leave any offers/suggestions. Only looking to sell.

That's the general rule unless it is signposted otherwise.

As to the second point, maybe someone else has more information than me, but to my knowledge there is no specific law that prohibits simply being somewhere as a homeless person. Various councils may have their own policies, and certain properties may very well ask you to leave, but unless you are breaching the Queen's peace, you should be fine.

Barbara Sukowa. She plays Doctor Katarina Jones of 12 Monkeys. She’s a Doctor with her own time machine.

While these are choices for the TV series, fan films are another way to show that what a female Doctor can do. There aren’t many DW fan films with a female lead but here are:

Silvana Maimone. She plays the 13th Doctor in the fan film short Lucky 13. She’s the tall woman with the big flowery coat and the long purple scarf.

Lilly Nelson. She plays a newly regenerated Doctor in the fan film The Ginger Chronicles, E01: A Dame to Kill.

Edit: Also Hannah Wollaston. She plays a different type of Doctor in the fan film Doctor Who - The Story Begins.

And it's not that /r/coys or other EPL subs don't like the MLS, in fact lots of us are fans of MLS teams as well, it's that pure speculation on your part of what players might look good in the PL eventually is just pointless content.

They make similar amounts to us **(2013 revenue US 33% GDP, UK 37% GDP)** but with much lower levels of taxation on most people. For instance in America the **bottom 20% of earners pay a tax rate of 17.4% on their income** (incl income tax, sales, excise, property etc), **compared to the UK where the bottom 10% pay 43%**. The top 10% here pay 35% &amp; in America 30%. 

The way they spend their money is ofc terrible &amp; regressive (barely any benefits etc), but they certainly make it in the right way. The main problem is VAT, hopefully they'll cut it sometime during this parliament.

There are far-left splitter groups like TUSC that are eurosceptics, but 35k voters really isn't a lot.

As long as the unions still fund Labour any left-of-Labour challenge is doomed to fail. For a DemSoc party that wasn't Labour to gain power the entire political landscape of the country would have to change.

On the issue of left-wing euroscepticism, I've been floating around the issue myself, at this point in time I think that without the promise of no political union I'd vote out. Simply because closer political union would make the ties with Europe almost unbreakable. If that was offered I'd vote in, which I don't say lightly, the EU is offering more protection for workers rights than the current Tory government, but that isn't saying much. 

As much as I may not like it England isn't going to swing to the left anytime soon and a Brexit could force Scottish independence meaning an even more right-wing Labour party.

Plus, frankly, the student loan system is much more sustainable right now since it is self-funding and no matter how poor you are you can go to university which I think is awesome.    
 
I myself only pay 1.5% interest which is lower than any other form of borrowing, and I can save at 3% APR, so I can pay off my student loan at the minimum repayment rate and actually *make* money on the money I haven't used to pay it off quicker. That's how good for a bargain student loans are.

Meanwhile we have an average or poor defense, midfield is bang average, wingers are the only area in which we have great players and everyone knows the striker situation. We will probably buy benteke and is anyone expecting him to score 20+ goals in the league?. We are also losing an important player in Sterling and Mignolet's performances in 2nd half of the season were great but he is not a top 4 level keeper.

CB: Very, very tough one. Sakho needs to get healthy, stay healthy and make Sakho - Skrtel a thing from day fucking one. If I knew this would happen, then I'd give the DEF the thumbs up. We have lots of depth at CB, but unless Sakho/Lovren/Ilori (at a very long shot) make that LCB spot their own, that depth won't mean a damn thing. Being realistic, **NO**.

FB: Clyne is a stellar signing. I think Moreno will be an excellent player two years from now. This season? I think there's a lot to learn for him defensively still. Beyond that, we have Flanagan and.... Wisdom, Ilori, Gomez? Flanno has had some serious injury problems and (if I'm not mistaken) won't be back for the start of the season. Enrique looks to be gone. Manquillo is gone. We need another actual fullback, not young CBs waiting for their time. Until we sign another fullback that can provide some solidity in Moreno's place or cover for an injured Clyne/Moreno, **NO**.

CM: Hendo, Milner, Lucas, Can, and Allen are all players I rate quite highly. Hendo and Milner are Top 4 quality and will presumably play each PL game unless injured. Lucas, Can, and Allen are fantastic back-up each with their own unique characteristics to suit the situation and, in form, enough ability to push Hendo and Milner. Great depth and lots of quality. **YES**

AM: Coutinho, Firmino, Sterling, and Lallana are all good enough to make significant contributions to a Top 4 side. Ibe and Markovic are good enough to push those four as well. With a healthy Sturridge in front of them, they'll be absolutely lethal. With a Balo-type in front of them, eh they'll make their own goals. Losing Sterling would be a blow since it seems Cheryshev or another unproven attacker would be brought in for him. Nonetheless, I say **YES**.

ST: Sturridge absolutely yes. He's up there with the best when healthy. Ings could be an excellent second striker but I don't yet know if he could lead our line if Sturridge only manages another 10 games. Origi is too hard to tell. Lots of potential, but counting on anything from him would be silly. Assuming Balo, Lambert, and Borini are gone. I think we need another top-tier striker, so **NO**.

OVR: I think we have a core group of players that is good enough and a manager that can get them playing exciting attacking football over long, successful stretches. I think we'll be much better than last season and a more cohesive unit than we were with Gerrard always feeling like a bit of a square peg, our RB underperforming, our keeper being on a different planet for half the season, having no suitable backup for Sturridge, no consistent partner for Skrtel or Hendo, and everyone else being 20 years old. But I don't think Sakho and Sturridge will stay healthy, I think Moreno is probably still too immature, and I think Sterling is gone and we'll replace him with another Markovic-like exciting player for the future. I can see it all working so well in my head just like all the people in the formations threads, but I think we'll probably get crushed by injuries and bleed goals again.

applies to the bit in *Listen* as well.

She's the one to do that not because she's insanely special, just because she was the one to be forced into that situation and of course she does what she can to help. I think many previous companions would have done something similar, they just didn't happen to be thrown into the situation.

Specifically, setting up a big focused character arc for a season with a satisfying and coherent pay off but then failing to follow through because of some sort of attachment to the character. 

In series 5, it was watching Amy deal with her traumatic fantasy filled childhood and abandonment issues which lead her to be manipulative and abusive to those around her. At the end of the series through her adventures, she was able to finally commit to Rory, got her parents back and was able to conjure her imaginary friend (back) into existence. She was at a perfect point to really follow through, and ask the Doctor to come visit but to focus her life on catching up with all the things she missed with her parents and move on to starting a life with the man she loved.

Instead we got... series 6... all development was dropped or actively reversed and she dealt with things like the trauma of losing her reproductive capability and the chance to give her child the normal life she had never really gotten by... um... almost divorcing Rory off screen sometime much later? And then being instantly fixed by the Doctor... again? Not even mentioning the fact that she dealt with her baby melting in her arms while dealing with a kid trying to fit into his family in *Night Terrors*? Then becoming some sort of general or something in a weird alternate reality?? WHAT THE FUCK

Similarly, in series 8 we saw Clara grow and evolve. She tried to hang on to her old life and tried to make a serious relationship to ground her to Earth. But as she was forced into the Doctor's position through episodes like Kill the Moon and began to truly understand him, her addiction and love of adventure grew to rival his. She picked up his leadership skills but she also picked up the exact tendencies that he fears in himself and changed from his ""carer"" to someone who could be chipper after watching people die. In the end of the season we saw that they had become too alike, they both would lie and manipulate to protect eachother and this would force them apart. This was a great consistent ending to her story. It let her go out on a bitter sweet note with hope for her future but with the knowledge that she would be forever changed by her experiences. 

Except... now she's already come back and had another almost as good exit, but rather than sticking to the story they planned to tell they changed it last minute because they like the character and/or actress. Now, I do as well, but the fact that they almost certainly won't come up with a conclusion at all as satisfying again (look at Amy and Rory or 11's last episodes for christ's sake) and changing it last minute implies a lack of planning for the character's future  and I think you have a right to be concerned.

I think Old Clara had simply accepted long since that Danny *had* been a viable alternative to the Doctor, but just couldn't be retrieved and was gone for ever, the way people do when someone they love died a long time ago.  Her initial decision, before the car accident, was to choose Danny, not the Doctor -- and Dream Danny in Last Xmas was certainly dreamed by her as the ""right one"".  Maybe she saw herself, at the end, as someone who could, by an exercise of will, become right for Danny, because she couldn't give up the normal life she could see coming along with commitment to him?

Big Finish has been working with the full Doctor Who license since 1999, and had been using spin-off material like Bernice Summerfield (a companion of the Seventh Doctor's introduced in the Virgin New Adventures) since 1998. Throughout that time, they've had monthly releases and created MANY spin-offs and special boxsets. As such, what you have are just a fraction of what they've released, which can be intimidating. If you like anything in particular that you hear and decide you want to get more, the least overwhelming path is probably just to pick a Doctor you like and get into their stories. Working out chronology can be ridiculous even with the help of Wikipedia, haha; don't hesitate to PM me or drop into /r/gallifrey and ask about it if you ever need some assistance; I expect it's a little more likely you'd catch someone else with a lot of knowledge of Big Finish there than here.

Sadly no Sixth Doctor material in what you have; I suppose his lesser popularity on TV discouraged BBC Radio from showing off what Big Finish have done with him. He's my favorite, though, haha, so I'd recommend checking out his stories starting with The Marian Conspiracy.

In any case, what you have works out as follows, in roughly chronological order per Doctor:

FIRST DOCTOR:

* Farewell, Great Macedon (This comes from The First Doctor Boxset. Big Finish's way of getting around the sad fact that the first three Doctors are no longer with us to record audios has been the Companion Chronicles format; sort of an enhanced audiobook where companions narrate and tell the story as they remember it happening, accompanied by music and sound effects and often at least one or two additional voices to fill in a bit. It often works quite well; I do prefer full-cast audios, but I'd much rather have stories in this format than none at all about the oldest Doctors. This one is narrated by Susan and Ian.)

FOURTH DOCTOR:

* Destination Nerva
* The Renaissance Man
* The Wrath of the Iceni
* Energy of the Daleks
* Trail of the White Worm
* The Oseidon Adventure

The above stories make up the first series of the 4DAs; three series have since been released, with two more planned at this time, though their chronology doesn't exactly run by series.

The era they slot into depends on which original companions were available for studio time, so series 1, 3, and 4 feature Leela and fit between seasons 14 and 15 of the TV show, while series 2 features Romana I and K-9 and fits between seasons 16 and 17. More was planned with Romana I, but sadly Mary Tamm died before more stories could be produced.

Series 5 and 6 are set to feature Romana II and K-9 as companions, which is another miracle from Nick Briggs, given that Lalla Ward and Tom Baker didn't part on the best of terms, haha; I can't back this up, but rumor claims Ward agreed only on the condition that she and Baker always record their lines separately.

OTHER FOURTH DOCTOR:

* Hornets Nest (this is a BBC Audiobooks production; Big Finish wasn't involved with it, and as such the format varies a bit; a bit more of a tendency to resort to narration to connect full-cast scenes, etc. Still very good. Was followed by two more sets with the same format and characters, Demon Quest and Serpent Crest)

FIFTH DOCTOR:

* 1963 - Fanfare for the Common Men (this was the first in a loose trilogy of stories released to Big Finish's main range in 2013 as part of the anniversary celebrations, followed by 1963 - The Space Race, with Six, and 1963 - The Assassination Games, with Seven.)
* Cobwebs
* The Whispering Forest
* Cradle of the Snake

SEVENTH DOCTOR:

* Protect and Survive (What an odd choice to pull out of the main range for radio release, haha. The main range does have ongoing storylines per Doctor, and this one kind of throws you in with Seven while he and Ace are joined by Hex, an audio-original companion. He's been in, I believe, 23 stories to date, and this one is the 17th among those. And the Doctor's barely in it at all, because McCoy was filming The Hobbit at the time. But it's an excellent story if you don't mind having no idea who Hex is and where he comes from or why he presently regards the Doctor the way he does, haha.)
* A Thousand Tiny Wings (This one and the rest of the Seven stories you have are with Klein. She was introduced in an early Big Finish story the better part of a decade before this, Colditz, and how she came to be traveling with the Doctor wasn't explained until the month following this story's release, haha.)
* Survival of the Fittest (Klein's Story, the short that explains Klein's presence, was packed in with this in original release. No idea if it's included in the iPlayer version.)
* The Architects of History

OTHER:

* Doctor Who and the Daleks (I can only assume this is Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday, a stage play featuring Trevor Martin as an alternate Fourth Doctor; Big Finish adapted it to audio a few years ago. Doesn't really fall anywhere because of the alternate Doctor matter, but it might be quite good, haha; haven't listened yet myself)
* Dalek I Love You/Dalek I Love You Too (These are short radio plays. Oddly, they're named after a synthpop band, haha. Apparently they're about an obsessive Who fan who meets a woman who may be an actual Doctor Who character at a sci-fi convention? I don't really know anything about these other than what I gathered from a quick Google search. Big Finish wasn't involved with them; looks like they were BBC7 productions.)

Then at the other end of the spectrum, I've never heard an American call somebody a cunt without them putting considerable venom into it and I've literally never heard an American say it affectionately the way it can be used in the UK.

tl:dr - both countries swear, but the Americans take it more seriously

My Salary is sub £40k but a friend at my old place had decided to become a manager and is now on £50k of course all of this pay rise comes under upper tax bracket (or did at the time) so immediately he lost £4k to income tax and then he paid increased national insurance and his pension payments from that (I know his pension is his but tell that to a 25 year old).

Well anyway all in all he was left with around £2.5k in his pocket from a £10k pay rise and we worked out the extra hours he was expected to do, the £2.5k did not even meet minimum wage.

Many low earners scream ''tax the rich'' but all this does is cause a brain drain, if my firend was to get promoted further his new department would fall under corporate which uses a tax haven to skirt the extremely high British income tax, I think this involves having to leave the UK for a certain time too hence the ''brain drain''.

They are a reflection of the ambitious transfer window that Khaldoon has openly set the club but is proving difficult because the players we're talking about are the cream of what's around. Also although we have access to a ton of money, turning City into a mega club is taking time.
Delph is odd in that he's gone and changed his mind at the last minute. No one saw that coming but the reasons are probably about guaranteed playing time etc. Who knows who's been in his ear. 
I feel sorry for Sterling because he's caught in the middle of a PR battle between a club, Liverpool, who act like it's high treason for a player to consider leaving, and his gobby, undiplomatic agent. City do not want to pay an over-inflated fee for him because it sets a bad precedent for future transactions. Similar story with Pogba's fee and salary - they're astronomical because he would probably rather sit it out till Barcelona can come along officially. 
When you factor in our ambitions, players' egos and clubs' statures, it isn't surprising that the window is playing out the way it is for us and that my predictions bob along on those waves of uncertainty (sorry for the metaphor but it seems apt). If the window turns out poor and we end up just with Sterling, questions will be asked. They are already being asked. The quick and quiet work of the last window brought us Mangala and Fernando. No controversy or spotlight attached to either of those, so quick and quiet it was. This situation couldn't be more different.

1. Cut those credit cards up, you need to stop using them.

2. Work out how much you need to actually live on per month, this doesn't include luxuries you can't afford right now. You may want to leave some in your bank account in a case of emergencies. Put this to one side, and use everything else to pay off your debts. Withdraw your budget every week in cash, or set up a separate, basic bank account and transfer your daily living expenses if that'll help.

3. Research your debts. Find out interest rates, how much you earn on each, minimum payments etc. Is this a student overdraft? If so, I'm assuming the limit going to start going down very soon.

4. Make a budget, and a plan to pay off these debts and stick to it.

Oh god.  You can probably imagine how much the whole thing made me, a card-carrying Jez fan, feel.  First anxiety at your preferred candidate being an empty chair, then slight disgust at the thought that he's not bothered turning up, then relief when he appears, and a slight bit of cringe too.

The funny thing is that I tabled a question (not selected :P) about rail nationalisation, and Jeremy basically answered it for me when he arrived!

&gt; Liz Kendall: […] she genuinely believes that being electable is the most important thing.

It might have helped if she'd said that in those terms, rather than ‘don't choose the hard-left’, as it's the one question that still bugs me about Jeremy.  The question that I think needs properly answering, without appeal to days gone by and all that, is: _why_ is the hard left less electable than the centre-left?

&gt; Andy Burnham: Very passionate, dedicated, heart is clearly in the right place.

Yes, I got this feeling too, and that's why he's jumped up a bit in my preferences.  Most of my opinion has been shaped by his constant bouncing around various sides of the party in an attempt to please everyone.  At this hustings he didn't bring any particular ideology into play (contrast with Jeremy and to some extent Liz!), but instead he let his convictions show.  This is both good (means he's definitely in the right party!), and bad (implies he's realised he keeps flitting around and has decided to sweep it under the carpet).

&gt; Yvette Cooper: I'm having tremendous difficulty summoning an opinion on her. Sorry. That probably says enough in itself.

Yeah… I wasn't sure what to make of her in this debate.  Her closing speech was the best on show (yes, better than Jeremy's, there, I said it), and hammered home the point that Cameron is patently sexist and needs to be put on the spot for it, but otherwise she didn't really stand out for me.

Also, isn't Cameron going by 2020 anyway?

EDIT:

&gt; You can probably tell where my allegiances lie, based on that. I have tried to be fair to the other candidates, for what it's worth.

I think you succeeded there :3  Sorry if my original post was a little too ‘yay Corbyn, boo Kendall’.

&gt;

&gt;__Corn Du__ is a mountain immediately to the southwest of [Pen y Fan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_y_Fan) and the second highest peak in [South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales), situated in the [Brecon Beacons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecon_Beacons) [National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park). Tommy Jones' Obelisk is found on its western flanks, in between the summit and [Y Gyrn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Gyrn).

&gt;The summit is very similar to that of Pen y Fan: flat and anvil shaped. It is similarly formed from the relatively erosion-resistant [Devonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian) age sandstones from the Upper [Old Red Sandstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Red_Sandstone) known as the Plateau Beds. It is marked by a large cairn. The summit is often crossed on the way to Pen y Fan. It offers good views down into Cwm Llwch and across the [Usk valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Usk) to [Brecon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecon). 

&gt;Nearby is one of the few natural lakes in the park, the diminutive [Llyn Cwm Llwch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llyn_Cwm_Llwch).

Lowering interest rates just kept that road to house price inflation viable. Even if we build, and it will be the big builders building, prices will not fall. They will drip feed the market as they have been or sell off plan to cash rich foreign investors.
Failing that there will be the domestic population borrowing as much as possible for the crumbs from the table. 

We are caught in the pincers, too few houses and too much cheap credit chasing the paltry stock.
The private sector big builders have said it is impossible for them to build 200,000 houses a year, we **need** 250,000 per year to satisfy Household formation.
Since the Tories stopped council house building we have been fucked long term with supply and banks doing away with sensible lensing has increased demand to apocalyptic bubble territory.

I fear the future will be even worse under the Tories especially if Boris ""London property is a global asset class"" Johnson becomes prime minister for 5 years, because you can bet *British* property will become a global asset class and big builders will still be allowed to drag their heels building half of what we need as long they provide big donations to the Tories.

To put it into context, when private sector big builders had competition from the council's building social housing, we used to build 350,000 homes a year, for a smaller population. Bit obvious now why Thatcher banned them from building.

Just another case of boomers pulling up the ladders, but this time relying on foreign investors to prevent price correction.

null,false,Sharwdry,null,null,null,"The essential problem of tax is you want to do 3 things:


1. Provide enough in state support for those who don't work to *survive* until they can find a job. 

2. Provide enough support for those who are working the worst jobs to be better off than what they would get from system 1. 

3. Provide incentives for working harder through low taxation.



The labour strategy for this was provide benefits for part 1, provide tax credits for part 2, and part 3 suffered. Now what the Tories have done is completely failed on part 1 - child poverty is going up, foodbank usage is soaring, and the vast majority of out of work benefits are going straight to landlords. They've failed on part 2, getting rid of tax credits is creating a system where it's hardly worth working a minimum wage job. They've gotten better at part 3 - by increasing tax allowances. The problem is they've done so in a hugely regressive way, and I would argue that the real problem is the graduation of our taxes. 


Say you're earning £45k, if you get a pay rise you're going to get maybe ~£1.5k a year if you're lucky, and most of that will go on tax. If you're earning £100k you aren't going to get a £1.5k pay rise, you're more likely to get a £5k pay rise, simply because it's proportional to your wages - however, you're on the same tax threshold! So the person on £45 gets screwed. I'd advocate introduction of 10,20,30,40,45p tax rates. Not to take more tax necessarily, but to insure that everyone actually benefits from working harder.


On top of that, and this is really important, it should never ever be *more* tax efficient to be a company than an individual, and it currently is.

Students don't take out loans because they think mortgage debt on a scale that most will never pay the whole back is an awesome idea.  They do so because with only a fairly small number of exceptions it's become a necessity to getting a decent job.

Not withstanding that the argument that lowered rates of NMW for under 25's are necessary to offset the lack of experience, but it also serves to push people into education which comes with the burden of debt.

I liked Mickey as he was honest, down to earth and caring/loving of Rose and Rose didn't really seem to care at all for Mickey - he was just available.  For instance, in the second episode, Rose is hanging out with another guy and not even giving Mickey a second thought - and she dumps him without a thought too, though he wasn't a person you would want to spend time with since he was so wrapped up in himself.  And she carried on like that.  When Mickey asked if he could come on the TARDIS, Rose was very unhappy with the thought of him coming along, whereas Mickey had grown to the point that he could partiicpate and enjoy the travelling.

Mickey got to grow as a character too, and even at the start he was worth far more from Rose than she gave him.

Danny doesn't like the Doctor and the influence he has on Clara, but that doesn't make him a bad character, just one that has strong opinions and isn't afraid of saying them.  It is refreshing, in fact, to have someone who often has dealings with the Doctor and isn't instantly wanting to go charging off saving the universe, but is perfectly capable of doing just that when called upon ( - a solider in fact, which is what he was), but not someone who thinks the Doctor is the best thing since sliced bread; and who sees the Doctor as a positive menace at worst and something to be suffered at best, though the Doctor has his uses, though often causes the problems that he then has to solve - basically a mixed blessing.

Whereas Clara does love Danny, but can't give up the high that travelling with the Doctor brings.  Danny is a solid, caring, loving man who is right for her.

In writing this I can see there are similarities between Mickey and Danny, but the problem is in their relationships with their ladies, and their responses to those - not in that Danny is written worse than Mickey.

I don't entirely disagree that your conclusions could be possible, but I think you slant it towards a presumption of guilty. I can't discount that what he said could be true too.

&gt;""but his fingerprints were on a different type of device that was found in the same suburb of Iraq’s capital city"" and at the same time claiming it wasnt directed at Americans., thats form in my book, plus purposefully going to a active warzone, consorting with insurgents, I assume you think he innocent and was only there as a humanitarian eh?


*""Anis was in Damascus because that’s where you went to study pure Arabic then. He saw the refugees coming in from Iraq and he went with a friend to try to get his family out. He talks about the situation there, how he saw the dead bodies lying in the street, in the canal, he described people coming out to the morgue at night looking for family members. Those IEDs were found in the exact spot where Shia militia came sweeping into the Sunni villages.""*

I think if you're going to discount this and go with 'he's got form', that's is part of the problem. Don't forget that the US court found him not guilty of the murder of the serviceman, yet the British one did. Different laws do play a part here. The Yanks where only interested in whether or not he was directly involved with blowing up the APC. Whereas here, he was making IEDs, so he's guilty of conspiracy, at the very least.

&gt; at best he's a liar and conned the yanks at worst he's a idiot who thinks the selective muder of anyone ( ie the bomb was meant for ""Shias"" is perfectly acceptable )


Choosing a side in a sectarian war is not murder, as you frame it, at least not for him. International law may agree with you though, under the guise of 'terrorism'. Don't forget, the target was Shia militias who were abducting and killing civilians. It's guerilla warfare, not everyone has the luxury to sit behind a state sponsored war machine where we tell ourselves that if we declare war, it's ok to blow people up.

Like I said, I don't completely disagree with what you say, you may well be stating the truth, but you have to admit that your arguments are slanted against him. Condemning him based on the 'evidence' is the stretch, for me.

The Terrorist Act 2006 doesn't really help his cause either. Neither does Brits going to Syria to join ISIS. Even though this incident was way before ISIS came about. I think it just adds to the Islamaphobia which is sweeping our country and is evidenced by the attitude of posters in political threads.

There is no hard and fast rule about how many points you need. Put simply, when we do well (as in, win the league well) the points needed go up massively. For example you needed over 100 after the 2009/10 season but after the 2010/11 season it went all the way down to *0*.

The way to do it, imo, is to target the high LP home games as an absolute minimum. All the CL groups. The Cups and so on. Throw in a few shit aways (as it's far easier to get tickets for aways as a member) and a decent number of home PL games and you'll be okay.

I'd tend to say that you should aim for over 100 but that advice may be a bit out of date because the club started giving out more LPs for games that they didn't previously - all Euro aways are now 5 LPs I believe.

null,false,betafrogg,null,null,null,"I think some routines can be long.  Layering, waiting, layering, making sure you have the right tools, making sure you're treating the skin for how it's presenting that day. 

In all honesty I don't always do the full routine I have figured out, sometimes I sleep with makeup and sunscreen from the day. Sometimes I get depressed and self care goes out the window for days. I think a few things help me want to keep to a routine:

* when I don't do my routine at all because of feeling generally shitty I soon notice my skin respond and I **realise that the routine I have is effective** and worth following because I know I feel less self conscious about my face when it's calmer and less spotty- I'm also **less likely to pick if there's nothing to pick** at and I know picking leads to PIH which is the main thin I'm trying to tackle
* for when I have low motivation/ energy/ lacking self care having a really **basic routine** helps it seem less daunting. For me that's warm OCM and sunscreen (full routine is double cleanse oil then foaming wash, adapalene or hyaluronic acid serums, sunscreen / night cream). Paring it down to the the minimum I can get away with doing for me skin not to get annoyed with me helps, but there are still times when that even is too much so:
* Learning to tell myself that I can start it up again, and that's okay. Just because I dropped it, doesn't mean I can't pick it back up again and carry on. It might be that in the future after your picked it up again and are feeling low motivation you can look at these two months and be inspired to carry on. Learn from this experiance kinda thing. For me one of the **nice things I realised about skin care is that I can always start up again**- I might have to use stuff like retinoids less frequently and build up again, but that's okay because I am doing it. 
* **Sheet masks**- for me the hyaluronic/ re hydrating types are fab for when I've neglected my skin and it needs a boost, the results are pretty instant and motivate me to know that getting back into the routine will be good
* Makeup- **I love makeup**, I love colouring in my eyes but I have dark circles and uneven skin tone so concealer and foundation type stuff helps even out my face and make my eye area stand out more. When I don't follow a routine the foundation and concealer just settles into my flakes and looks pretty bad. So planning to go out, or wear makeup I know I need to look after my skin for a few days in advance, which helps motivate me.

Maybe consider having a very basic routine and saying to yourself, At least twice a week I'm going to do a full routine. Then build up from there?

These loans should have a realistic prospect of being paid back, unlike the current system where 60% of loans are *expected* to be written off by the governments of 2045 onwards, and some economic analysts believe this is an underestimate.

Basically, the system we used to have before the coalition fucked it up.
