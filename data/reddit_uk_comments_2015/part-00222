There won't be ""a low APR option"" because it is expensive to make short-term unsecured loans and APR includes compounded interest over a 12 month period but the lives of these payday loans are on average 14 days. The best measure for any loan is the total amount to be repaid.

We're back and working more closely with /u/Lolkac during this offseason!  It's been a tough year but let's look forward to the next with good humour and buckets of optimism.

* Undoubtedly the biggest news of the day is the potential return of [Bolo Zenden](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs1/1373095_o.gif), rumoured to be working closely with Sturridge on some new moves for next season.

* Although Migs has grown into the role of commanding taskmaster goalkeeper, there's no damage done in bringing in Bogdan.  Apparently [Migs isn't so happy though](http://31.media.tumblr.com/f29c7ea75aa70a857f27a146b9aa0a0e/tumblr_mrh1w9HJ4Z1sfp1fio1_500.gif).

* Mancini [said some stuff about Kovacic](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dont_give_a_shit_morgan_freeman.gif).  Kovacic says ['never say never'](http://img.pandawhale.com/58669-so-youre-telling-me-theres-a-c-Sm9B.gif)

* Sakho says he's staying and wants to achieve the greatest of things!  [Great news for the club](https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380393870/758402.gif)

* Liverpool [won't be letting Marko leave](http://1.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/61/93/dbd35bfa3bf79ca72a54770f8fce616c-when-youve-got-lemon-make-lemonade.gif).  We've got Marko,  make Markozade.

&gt;Free speech XKCD

""Free speech"" doesn't only refer to the constitutional right. Perhaps it is you who needs to improve their understanding.

In a world where the majority of people spend a large amount of their time in privately-owned spaces- be they virtual or physical- we are at risk of being suppressed and controlled by those who have no obligation to uphold basic rights like freedom of speech. Just because these companies can't put you in jail for it, doesn't mean they can't do damage to society once a large population begins to heavily rely on their services.",null,0,null,1434054439,null,0,false,0,cs3gk17,null,t3_39fjpk,null,t1_cs3gk17,null,t1_cs3fml8,null,null,null,1436919159,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Islam is open to interpretation, same as any collection of philosophies and stories. There is not one consensus on what Islam teaches, or what a 'good Muslim' should do. Some are outdated, yes. But if some Muslims aren't like this, then surely these problems are not caused by the religion itself, but external factors. If there are problems with Muslim communities, or teachings, then of course we need to tackle them! But making this into an issue of the religion as a whole is counter intuitive, as it drives away people within the religion who aren't doing these things.

A lot of people buying houses are still moving up the career ladder, so they can expect a jump in salary equivalent to (or sometimes more) than the rate of house price rises, and it's not linked directly to annual wage inflation.

null,false,aenor,null,null,null,"I'm being devil's advocate here, but regarding surpluses, you could argue she's trying to be true to Attlee's Labour rather than the Conservatives.

In the last 100 years (so starting well before WW2), the only times we've ever run a budget surplus were 

* Under Attlee who ran a budget surplus in the years 48/49 and 49/50 
* Thatcher who ran a surplus in one solitary year 87/88 and 
* Blair in 98/99, 99/00, 00/01 

As you can see, most surpluses have happened under Labour govts, so Labour should ""own"" the surplus thing. Yet somehow the Conservatives are able to pretend that they are prudent and Lab spendthrift, partly because Labour people attack anyone on their own side who say they should spend tax money wisely.

Actually it should be a given that tax money should be spent wisely - and Lab can cut waste without hurting front line services. For example, why are we sending a cheque for £250k to the Sultan of Brunei to help him maintain his Scottish grouse estate? Why are we paying wind farm subsidies to old titled Norman baronial landowners (like Cameron's father-in-law) when clean coal electricity is both cheap, efficient and environmentally friendly? Why arn't we at the forefront of getting the EU's corporate tax laws amended to make Google, Microsoft, Starbucks and co pay what they owe in respect to profits earned in the UK?

We can't attack on any of these because we've knee-jerked decided that if Conservatives are against spending, we're for it, even if it means precious tax money wasted on subsidies to our traditional enemies.

The smarter response would be to say we agree with the principle that tax money must be wisely spent, we disagree on where the cuts should fall and on how to safeguard tax money from the EU corporate vultures (we've abrogated responsibility for challenging EU mistakes entirely)",null,0,null,1434055284,null,0,1434055595,0,cs3h54n,null,t3_39gbte,null,t1_cs3h54n,null,t1_cs36qme,null,null,null,1436919501,null,6,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,6,null

Liverpool have rejected a projected £30 million offer from Manchester City for Raheem Sterling, the unsettled England forward.

City made their move earlier this week, offering a guaranteed £25 million, plus £5 million in potential future payments.

The Merseyside club value the 20-year-old at more than £50 million and maintain that they will not consider selling for less than that sum.

Liverpool have still not given up hope of persuading Sterling to sign a new contract, despite the claim from Aidy Ward, his agent, last month that the winger would not extend his deal “even if they offered him £900,000 a week”.

However, the growing sense of acrimony between the club and the player, who informed Brendan Rodgers last month of his desire to leave, has led the Liverpool hierarchy to contemplate the possibility of a sale.

Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United also hold an interest in Sterling, who is on international duty with the England squad in advance of their Euro 2016 qualifier away to Slovenia on Sunday.

City have made him a key target as they look to add young English talent to their squad, but they believe their projected £30 million offer was fair and do not plan to meet Liverpool’s asking price.

Along with Sterling, City have identified Paul Pogba, the Juventus and France midfield player, and Kevin De Bruyne, the Wolfsburg and Belgium winger, as prime targets this summer.

2. Any members of the defunct Labour Party who wish to remain a member of the new party **and** who held public office during the years from 2001 to 2010 shall be invited, as a condition of their continued membership, to sign an apology for Labour's roles in: a) the illegal invasion of Iraq; b) the collusion in US and other programmes of extraordinary rendition and torture; c) the unchecked expansion of state surveillance by GCHQ and others; d) the attempts to force a compulsory biometric national ID card and DNA database upon the nation; and e) all associated attacks by the Labour Party upon the rights, liberties and moral standing of the people of the United Kingdom.

3. Anyone who held a cabinet-level position under the governments of the defunct Labour Party during those years shall be invited to make this apology straight to Youtube.

4. Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Jack Straw, David Blunkett, John Reid, Jacqui Smith, Margaret Hodge and Phil Woolas shall not be invited or permitted to be members of the new party under any circumstances, nor shall any Labour public official who campaigned publicly in support of the 'No to AV' campaign. These people are anathema to the new party's values.

5. The unions may continue to fund the new party if they wish, with their members invited to contribute on an opt-in basis, but the unions themselves shall have no voting power within the new party.

6.

Why spend 8-10m on a backup that will probably only play a few games during the season especially with the glaring needs we have else ware? That 10m could be added to a bid for a striker, RB or CDM. I understand when you look at teams like Arsenal, Man City, United and Chelsea they all have better backups than us, but they also have better strikers, RBs and CDMs. In my opinion we have more important needs to spend our money on and if we can get a quality backup (which Bogdan is, probably even better than that) on a free than I think this is a great move.

There is no reason why come January or even next summer we can't go after a better backup once our more glaring priorities are taken care of. And that's assuming Bogdan is terrible, which IMO he is not.

What people need to understand is that when he was healthy for Bolton he was VERY solid. He was not second choice when healthy. People seem so mad about a back-up keeper signing...

We need to be smarter than this - and that requires thinking about the issues before spouting off. It would be great if we had our own list of things that should be cut (like wind-subsidies to cameron's father-in law) and we could circulate it and put pressure on the Conservatives to respond.

Let's not forget that Miliband was supposed to be the most left-wing candidate 5 years ago. Burnham a staunch Blairite and all that. ""Red Ed"" was really not that red after all, if anything he was a  very watered down version of what socialist politics should be about.

I don't doubt that *the party* was at fault. Miliband still had to appease both the unions and the Blairites, and it was an impossible task. I still view Blair as being ideologically inclined to Thatcherite policy, and I've yet to see evidence to disprove that. So Miliband had to fight on several fronts and yup, he was probably never up to the task - he had to rely on gimmickry FFS.

Both the Labour Party and the Liberals (Lib Dems if you really want) have had such implosions that there is no way back as they currently stand. If an alternative to Tory pissflappery is to be had, it has to be a return to Socialist values from both ""leftish centrish I-dunno-ish"" parties. Neither really knows what they want. Blair destroyed Labour by making New Labour a centrist party but now it seems that every party is intent on satisfying the desires of the media. You want the votes, jump into bed with whichever newspaper boss you need. Campbell and Blair won because they rolled over and took it from Murdoch. And that's the real enemy, right there.

    ""As a writer you will know that one of the favourite fantasy plots of a writer is, a character's told 'you've got three months to live,' and who would you kill? I call my cancer Rupert, so I can get close to it. Because that man, Murdoch, is the one who, if I had the time (I've got too much writing to do...) I would shoot the bugger if I could. There is no one person more responsible for the pollution of what was already a fairly polluted press.

The big advantage to prefab is health and safety management (more works done in a factory not on a messy site) and speed of the actual on site build.  

One thing to consider is the actual project life cycle for modular (sorry pre fab) vs traditional is very similar but the process is more front loaded - clients don't like this as from a cash flow perspective they are paying much earlier without the security of materials onsite.  This leads to a bit of risk and vesting off site again clients don't typically like this as if the factory goes bust its a pain to get the administrators to release goods.

My big gripe with pre fab is its manufacturing going to construction not the other way around,  so many simple things (like plasterboarding and staggering of joints) that are taken for granted in construction are almost having to be retaught and frankly its a bit of a pain in the arse and leading to so much rework its frightening.",null,0,null,1434057405,null,0,1434057624,0,cs3ikch,null,t3_39fveu,null,t1_cs3ikch,null,t1_cs3hz60,null,null,null,1436920578,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

The main difference is that Rodgers (narrowly) hasn't managed to win any major trophies, despite being in a much more competitive league, and apparently that's the difference between being regarded as a poor manager, and being widely overrated as ""world class"". Apparently finishing 6th with the 5th richest team is the mark of a useless manager, but finishing 7th with the 2nd richest (and they're 2nd richest by a large margin over 3rd or 4th) is just a little blip that can be safely ignored when assessing his career. Yes, Klopp has trophies under his belt, great, but it's not everything - Djimi Traore has won a Champions League final and that doesn't mean he was a great defender. 

I'd have taken replacing Rodgers with Rafa, but that's because Rafa has won multiple trophies over several years and with different squads at different clubs. Klopp has had one (very) good spell with one good squad and has managed to end it in abysmal form.

It means not investing in long-term economic growth or infrastructure, it means the government sitting on its hands in recessions instead of getting the economy back into growth. 
Running a surplus does not inherently equal good economic policy. It completely ignores the fact that your overall % of debt can decline even when you're running a deficit so long as the economy is growing sufficiently.

They were found innocent because they believed there was consent (note: the standard has changed since this case, but this demonstrates the idea that the mind of the perpetrator is important).

And this is from someone who obviously thinks the ""cure"" is bullshit. But I also think God is bullshit and could make the argument that religious beliefs increase the risk of prejudice and homophobic attacks... I wouldn't say a poster promoting being religious should be banned.

I don't know, this basically just strikes me as silencing an opinion through legal action, which seems a really ineffective way to win the argument. I presume if you talk to these people, they actually believe in the cure.

null,false,BritishLibrary,null,null,null,"First of all, don't panic. Think and breath. It's only short term and you can get out of it.

Secondly. Stop applying for loans, like, right now. Many applications in a short space of time are not helping your credit score. You're only going to make things worse if you continue to apply right now.

So, I've been in a position before where I kept getting buggered by banking fees - and you're right it's a frustrating cycle. I promise you that taking out a loan is not a solution, but better budgeting can be. And whatever you are thinking - don't even approach a payday loan company. They charge around 1500% in interest/APR. 

Now - as to approaching and getting yourself out of this - a few things to do:

**1) Your Bank**

You haven't mentioned in your post where you have spoken to your bank and explained your circumstances, asked for formal overdraft, or challenges the fees. 

Under Banking and Lending codes - banks *must* treat you fairly if you are in financial hardship - and certainly living in your overdraft, income eaten by charges, or potentially living off credit with overdraft fees pushing you into your overdraft would count as this. Tell your bank, and they have a duty of care to help. They may reverse some of the charges, or minimise them or something similar. 

I'd also attempt to set up a formal overdraft facility with your bank. Explain your circumstances and estimate when you can get out of the overdraft. Call them and ask for these things as your priority.

You may also benefit from changing to a bank with more favourable overdraft rates. 

May be worth a read:
http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/bank-charges


**2) Vodafone and Apple**

Please don't fall into a trap of blaming these two vendors for this - whether you like it or not you have a contract with Vodafone, and cancelling the DD just means you're then failing to pay the bill / meet the contractual obligations. Anyway, this is in the past now.

If you can, get the situation in writing from either supplier as to the reasoning for the charge. You can use this to write to credit reference agencies explaining the history on your credit report. Vodafone should be able to reverse/change some items on your credit score (i.e. your cancelled direct debit on their advice) if you report the complaint. (I think).

I would certainly be somewhat assertive with both suppliers to challenge the issues they caused you. Complain where you can.

**3) Credit Score**

You can request copies of your credit scores from the main credit reference agencies (for a small fee), and Noddle will give you a free version. You can challenge items on your credit report / write to the agencies to get the lines removed etc. May be worth while in your situation.

**4) Future**
You didn't talk about your income, or situation - but I would wager there are areas within your finances you could cut down on in order to make up some shortfall. Put yourself into a 'financial lock down'. Draw up a budget (if you don't already have one) - work out what your actual outgoing are, and work out where you can reduce. YNAB (/r/ynab) is a good resource for this, but is only a methodology.

Once you're out of this, begin to build an emergency fund. People say 6 months of earnings to cover any potential life disaster. £1000 is a good place to start, and means some potential problems when your near your overdraft are a bit easier to handle. 

Hope that's of some use :)

Mine asked my lodger to sign a form which basically waives any rights or interest in the property that they might attempt to seek by living there. This is basically to ensure that the mortgage provider can still exercise their rights to the property in the event they want to repossess it. Otherwise I don't think they are terribly interested in things as long as you keep paying your mortgage.

You will also still need to have buildings insurance as that will be a condition on your mortgage (at least that is how it works with houses, not sure about flats.). Typically these will have some clause about ensuring the house is not unoccupied for more than x number of days. You will need to check the wording on that, in the event of there being a void in your tenancy or not letting it out.

That said I'm not sure how the counting process led to corruption for the last election - if anything, the electoral college system actually weighed heavily in favour of party members and MPs (as the electorates were smaller than the union electorates).

Bullshit. I've see those reports that break down absolutely every square centimeter of an area and report what's green space. The Thames itself; green-space (by virtue of it not being built-upon urban space). Good luck building over a navigable river.

Grass verges and trees on pavements; green-space. They add the total area of a full tree to the real Cartesian area of the city and call that extra space green-space (which they imply can be built upon - treehouses?). 

Zone 1 would include Hyde Park, right? That is certainly bona-fide green-space, but it absolutely is not a place that is suitable for being built upon. It's already in use. It's one of the few places that humans can run and stretch for miles without being meters from a running car exhaust. It's the only place large enough to host large festivals and events.

I bet you're right though, the housing crisis in London could be solved if they firebombed the entire area circumscribed by the M25 and built a single cubic-mile buiding accommodating all the homes and offices. It could be like a parked [Borg Cube](http://www.startrek.com/legacy_media/images/200508/tng-142-j25-borg-cube/320x240.jpg).

&gt; While transfers of sole residence were rare as the courts as the courts sought to preserve status quo where transfers were ordered they were disproportionately likely to be transfers from mum to dad and to feature welfare concerns[**A**] and children’s services involvement[**B**].

While it is undoubtedly true that are cases where women are trying to protect their children from a non-custodial father, those are both (**A**) proportionally less common and (**B**) less strongly supported. You have denied **A**, and have proposed a reason for **B** that could only be addressed by assuming a father is a risk to his children but social services haven't had the opportunity to catch him yet, which courts should not be doing.

Here's another couple of quotes that make the difference clearer:

&gt; There were 30 applications by mothers that were clearly about seeking sole residence. [...] Child welfare concerns were raised in 18 cases, with significant Local Authority involvement in 8 cases. 

&gt; [...]

&gt; 26 out of 32 applications by fathers for residence orders featured alleged child welfare concerns. [...] There was what we classified as significant Local Authority involvement in 15 of these cases.

This is the problem with the attitude of so many people, I feel, taxes are not a piggy bank! They aren't a savings account for you personally, they are to pay for the running of the country.

Although we know that National Insurance Contributions are just flung into the general taxation pot, the entire purpose of them is to fund a safety net predominantly in respect of healthcare, unemployment benefits and a state pension.  This is entirely why this would trigger the, ""Hold on, I already paid you for **that**!"" response.  If there's a 'loan' it's the sum I paid in in NICs, not the benefits I might receive when the floor falls out of my life and I lose my job.

Insofar as that goes, this is why many people will think that your attitude is wrong, when you high-handedly declare what, 'the problem with the attitude of so many people' is.  Sure, it's not a piggy-bank, you're right so far as that bit goes.  Sure, we won't all get as much out of the system as we pour into it.  That said, as a general rule the people who get more out aren't doing all that awesomely.

The smooth function of state funding in a consensual taxation system **absolutely depends** on implied reciprocity.  

The entire reason a policy like this is given serious consideration is to cut costs enough to allow the predominantly Conservative voting older demographic - who on the whole have already taken far more from the system than they ever put in - can continue to receive pensions and similar perks which cost well over 20% of total state spending, sheltering them from any of the so-called hard decisions at the of those funding them and for whom the implied reciprocity contract has been flung aside.

* **Cardiff**, very similar city to the above but in Wales instead of the South East so is cheaper. As it is the capital of Wales its also grander and prouder.

* **Newcastle** is a good choice and is a lot cheaper than other options, but fairly geographically isolated. Newcastle has a brilliant transport system and friendly people and is said to be the best night out in the UK.

* **Bristol** is the capital of arts and the alternative outside of London with a big student population. Parts are very pretty and it also near Bath which is imo the prettiest city in the country. Bristol is most expensive and the least friendly of the places i've listed but its a very interesting place and feels large.

* **Manchester** is great if you decide you want somewhere properly large without the traffic,costs and stress of London. Greater Manchester claims to have the most students in Europe.
Manchester is the main city of the North and has basically everything you'd want and you wont get bored of it. Some of the towns nearby are awful but Manchester is an interesting place and seems to be on the up. Its also cheaper than Bristol, Southampton and Cardiff.

I dont know much about **Leeds** other than that it appears to be on the up economically and there are some nice places to live, although some very not nice places as well.

Sheffield, Nottingham and Leicester fit your criteria but I would personally be wary about living in them. Other people have mentioned Norwich but it is small and very geographically isolated.

null,false,imdrinkingteaatwork,lfc99,null,null,"Are you suggesting we are not going to improve?  Or are you seriously asking how?

If you are asking, then I will tell you. For one, and for the most part, last season was really not as bad as everyone is making it seem.  There is a lot to factor in on why it went as wrong as it did.  We lost our best player and had to change a system that we had worked around.  And then our second best player was injured for most of the season so we also had to work around that.  Multiply that by quite a few new faces that needed time to mesh... great year?  No.  Catastrophic?  I really don't think so.  Really though, last year, if Sturridge was healthy or if we had signed Bony instead of what seems like the transfer committee going against Rodgers and choosing Balotelli, I'm absolutely positive we would have at least secured fourth.  No question we would have Champion's League football.  Balotelli  showed he could not do much up top alone, but he did show signs of positivity that one game he started with Sturridge against Tottenham.  If he would have scored that header in t he first ten minutes (which he probably should have) the whole universe would be different right now.

With that said, it really shows how the bulk of our problems this year came in the final third... we had no striker game whatsoever.  We could not score when we needed to or should have been scoring.  It was very frustrating.  I don't know why Rodgers went on that stretch where he kept using one striker when it wasn't working, but... well I don't have a but.  

This year if we get a solid striker to sub in for an injured Sturridge and play with him when he is healthy should fix that problem pretty quickly.  Plus Ings will work as a great backup plan.  He is a hard worker and a great presser, and that isn't even touching on his finishing skills.  He did pretty well with the service from his Burnley teammates, and I think Coutinho and Henderson feeding him the ball will just make him even better.  And we have the young and talented Origi coming in.  He may be unfinished, but hopefully Rodgers can bring the best out of him like he has with other players.

As for signing new strikers?  I steer clear from speculating.  I am just not the type to say ""we should sign x"" because... uh I have absolutely no control over any of that and I don't pretend to think I know more than those that actually make the decisions.  I just sit back and watch.  I was even excited for Downing when we signed him a few years back. :/  I have been one of the few on the pro-Benteke train, because I think he is a very solid player and has a lot more to offer than being just a target man, but I think the news has been reading that he may stay at Villa.  I would still be very excited if we did manage to sign him though.  But then again, I was excited when we signed Downing a few years back...

As for our defense, and our lapses there, I think a lot of it had to do with the team not gelling yet.  I think Lovren really turned around what put so many off, I think Skrtel always has his positives, and I think Sakho is very good.  Another season together should do them all some good.  I think Can was in defense because of the formation needing a guy like him and injuries to some of our defenders at the time made him an ideal candidate.  And with the locked in-Gerrard out there will be more room for him in the midfield.  But again, I don't really know anything because I am not in control.  I do agree with a lot of people when they say that a good solid defensive midfielder will do us wonders.  Before Lucas got his first injury, like 2010-11, he was absolutely phenomenal.  He was the best defensive midfielder in the league by far, and up there with the best in the world.  But that injury killed him, especially each time it came back.  Not only did it set him back, it also negatively set the team back.  I still think he has a place here, and without our captain here anymore it makes it less of a Lucas only plays if Gerrard doesn't kind of thing.  Again, we'll see.

Also, it looks like we are looking for rightbacks, and I have ALWAYS rated Clyne.  He is really coming into his own.  We'll see on that.  But what I am really excited to see is how the Manquillo ordeal will pan out.  I am one that tends to belief we did not play him as much (besides not being a good fit as a RWB when we went 3 at the back)
because of how the whole loan thing with Atletico works.  I think they have the option to take him back right now or buy him outright or smething, but if they don't he is ours completely after next year.  Not sure though.  Maybe I will post a thread about that soon because I really like them.  He is young.  He is solid defensively.  So we shall see.

Hope that answers your question if you were asking.  But if you were being cynical and just being rhetorical then... well... just don't be cynical.  Be more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZH3xiWK.jpg).  Things like that really know how to be!  

In conclusion, less cynicism more not-cynic[ism.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prgm4eKq6d4)

The only place on the pitch where we can play with a bit is Eriksen's position, either move a player more forward from CAM as a striker or put someone else there and drop him deeper but the philosophy stays the same. We need at least two in the middle of the park and Eriksen for me is a nailed down starter at CAM. Unless you want to move Eriksen to left-wing then I just do not see there being any space for Benteke. This also means dropping Kane deeper, why would we ever do this?

At the end of the day we have far more pressing issues right now that to drop a fuck-ton of money on a new striker. This would be a hard transfer even if we really needed him but, fact is, we don't. Assuming outward transfers go the way we like, we need a left-winger, centre-midfielder, a couple of (back-up) strikers and competition for right-back.

You can do so much more for the world by staying alive, and working to do good. You could volunteer for a charity. I know a guy who works all year round then takes five weeks off to fly out to Africa, and donate a shitload of his annual earnings and five weeks of his time to a school he helps run there, although there are less extreme options like that. Whatever though, it's up to you. You could end it all, or you could give up on it all and devote your life to doing stuff that's amazing for other people, or you could stick with it, change your scenario, and hold on for the days when things get better.

There is zero confirmation about this, but if they had to pick a date their most likely debut weekend would be sometime between Friday, August 28 and Monday, August 31, 2015. That would also allow for a Christmas special after the end of the season (but still in time for Christmas or New Year).

I think others on this thread have listed the episodes you may want to look out for in the ""gap"" years. I'd add a special called *An Adventure In Space and Time*. It is a story about the creation of the show back in the 1960's (not a documentary but a dramatic re-creation). If you don't know what a groundbreaking show Doctor Who was back in the 1960's and the uphill battle that they had, it's a very nice recap. True, the real personalities of the people may have been a little less likable, but the dramatized retelling is far more entertaining than a documentary.

I would suggest a good way to get into fandom is to listen to some podcasts about *Doctor Who*. I've already mentioned *Radio Free Skaro*. Additionally, the *Verity* podcast offers a very good female perspective on Whovian topics. The runners of both of these podcasts are married and they recently started a third podcast called *Lazy Doctor Who Podcast* where they are going through all of the episodes starting will the William Hartnell episodes in the 1960's, watching, and reviewing all of the episodes with commentary.

The loan he wants paid back is also not related to the retail deal. King may try to use the loan Ashley wants back as an way to renegotiate said deals, but that is something they are still working on.

As to why King doesn't just want to give that £5m back: He never made those deals and there is a lot of belief within the club that the contracts were made by people who did not have the best interest of the club at heart (including Ashley). So they are seeking every way possible to not repay them before the contractually agreed time.

It's no secret that the club is still in financial trouble, we need to get almost an entire new team and coaching staff which are things that take priority for the benefit of the club.

Considering the amount of merchandise sold (or lack there of I should say) it doesn't really matter if the club gets 51% of the merchandising back, 51% of very little is still very little. Ashley's statement also claims there is no way to prove that the club is hardly getting anything out of the deal, despite numbers released months ago proving that for every £10 of Rangers merchandise sold by SD the club only sees about 70p. In the last accounts it was even said that the club had received nothing at all. 

King made it clear that if they find all the contracts to be watertight then Ashley can get his money back asap. 

As for your claim that Ashley took out that gagging order so King and the supporters wouldn't 'derail the EGM', the board already made it clear that they had no interest in breaking any confidentiality agreements. 

This is nothing else but that fat bastard grandstanding. Hopefully in the EGM they'll tell him to fuck off and wait for his money.

That all said, I completely agree about his ability. Although I put some of that on his age, the world cup, the media circus (he had his hand in), etc. He won't be Ronaldo. He won't be Messi. Ultimately I think this is the problem with people evaluating Raheem, because everyone does their evaluations based on comparing players to other top players. Raheem really isn't like a lot of other top players on his top days. 

He's surprisingly strong (it was oft trotted out how he was weak in his first seasons with us, but that was never played out in fact. It was just something that appeared like it should be true). He can break away from nearly any defense. He can actually pass (although, yes, he can't cross to save his life). He can actually slot anywhere across LW, CAM, RW. He'll work hard enough to play full back if you need defensive cover against a team with someone like, say, Ronaldo. 

He can be a great player who doesn't fulfill any obvious comparisons. At least not in England.

I think the ""problem"" is that the visa system is broken. Either they need to make it harder, or more expensive, to obtain a Tier 2 visa, or they should raise the minimum wage required to hire someone on a Tier 2.

I guess if you can get a foreign nurse for £1K/annum cheaper than a local one, then paying £1K for the visa is still seen as a fair price to pay.

Therefore I think raising the minimum wage forces them to hire local, unless they want to pay more for foreign staff.

I don't think there are any easy solutions. In my scenario, their counter-argument would be that businesses would have to pay extra for staff if they can only find foreign staff.

Secondly, he mentions the trade deficit, and he mentions the government deficit, but he never mentions the private sector, which is the third sector and is just as important as the other two.  It follows quite logically that if we're running a large trade deficit, and the government wants to run a surplus then the only way this is sustainable is to drain the private sector of financial assets and eventually force it to go into debt, creating balance sheet instabilities.  Running a government surplus at the same time as a big trade deficit is a stupid idea (and shows Osbornes plans up for the economic nonsense they are), and if he was a decent journalist he'd go further into this idea to try to explain it, and would show just how potentially [damaging and stupid](http://coppolacomment.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/repeat-after-me-sectoral-balances-must.html) this idea is.

null,false,Himandheruk,null,null,null,"He ripped up a system that worked (admittedly far from perfect, but it worked). The SHAs provided the standards, guidance and development strategy. The PCTs managed the allocation of patient care. These were disbanded very quickly and abruptly to be replaced by CCGs, largely doing the same as the PCTs but lead by GPs. The SHAs were initially replaced with very little and when they realised they did do something then this was picked up by NHS England. 
Various auditors have also been added into the mix following paranoia after Mid Staffs. 

So in essence a functioning system was trashed and a new system put in its same place with the primary goals to allow GPs to lead on commissioning and to allow much easier access to private care providers. 

It cost the tax payer approx £3billion to scrap the working system and set up the new ones which in many cases lead to expensive pay offs or the very same people employed! 

Simply adding private healthcare into the system is a total folly. Past industry privatisations in the UK are littered with examples of this. Service providers are compelled to employ the same staff under the same conditions (TUPE), company profits are added and new levels of administration are then required. There is an argument that in some cases these suppliers are more efficient however this is often cancelled out by these new costs and profits or the escalation of fees once the private company is nicely settled in. Examples - has privatisation made train travel or your energy suppliers good value, is BT any less hopeless to deal with than they used to be, will the price of a stamp now fall, or your postie arrive before you go to work like they once used to? 

It was no coinsidence that Lansley and other Conservative minsters had personal interests, assets or roles in private healthcare companies and we must not ignore Mr Lansleys wife was a GP. But there is nothing to be cynical about in any of this. However DC must of become worried so he had Lansley moved on before the absurdity of it all became too hot to handle. DC did a fantastic job of covering up most of this to the wider public, getting his MPs to tow party line but the biggest shame of all was Labour were hopeless at exposing it, to be fair the Lib Dems did have a good go. 

Mr Hunt is now seeking to quietly undo some of this mess which means more wasted tax payers money and more NHS staff time spent on system change rather than patient care.

You have £45k plus £8,450 (annual earnings for 25 hours/week @ min. wage) **divided by two people**, which means you guys have about £27k apiece pre-tax. (It's actually a bit worse than that because of higher taxes for you, but you get the idea.)

It's for you to decide what the trade-offs will be and what's reasonable: perhaps your partner could get a second job to top up her income? Maybe one or both of you could do work on the side to bring in more money?

But as long as you have a budget that leaves you &lt;£200/month of breathing space you are going to feel pressured.

Now my commute is a minimum of 7.9 miles each way (up to 12 miles depending on what route I take) and it takes between 17 and 22 minutes, depending on traffic.

In London, I repeatedly found that the often quoted statistic of average car speed being roughly equal to the average horse speed before the age of cars was correct. It took roughly half an hour to travel 6 miles in and out of town, not just for commuting, i.e. 12 miles an hour.

Up here it's very roughly 25-26 miles an hour average.

So that means I drive much longer distances for basic things like getting food from a farm shop, because it takes more or less the same amount of time as driving to a supermarket in London. I'm happy to drive 30 miles instead of 5 to 6 to get something.

There are some who believe that the state should only pay when it can afford to without taking on debt since debt has a very real cost (interest) and that the amount we spend on national debt is larger than many departmental budgets combined. Also, by taking on debt you are forcing future generations to pay for something which may have yielded quick short term benefits but no long term ones i.e. the classic pump spending before an election. 

Then there's the school of thought that says some debt is fine, indeed healthy and we need debt to cover problems which need solving now and not in 20 years. I.e. that the costs of debt are outweighed by the benefits. 

Many (not all) Tories believe in the former approach whereas Labour (at least under Blair) seemed adept at spending money like no tomorrow and running deficits while the economy was booming which is generally considered a bad thing.

http://www.inbrief.co.uk/football-law/football-quotas-and-home-grown-player-rule.htm

&gt; What are the current UEFA Rules?
&gt; 
&gt; The current UEFA rules state that the 25 man squad submitted by each club playing in the UEFA Champions League must have at least 8 locally trained players named in it.


Also Greg Dyke's proposed changes to the home grown rules which would make it almost impossible to have foreign home grown players :-

http://www.thefa.com/news/thefa/2015/mar/greg-dyke-england-commission-homegrown-players-work-permits-march-2015

&gt; A change in the definition of home grown player to any player, irrespective of their nationality, who has been registered with any club affiliated to The FA or Football Association of Wales (FAW) for a period of three years prior to the player’s 18th birthday (currently the definition states a home grown player has to be registered with The FA or FAW for three years before their 21st birthday).

For instance, Brad Jones currently counts as home grown because, although born in Australia, he was registered for at least three years with Middlesbrough from the age of 17. If what The FA proposes goes through, he'd be treated as an overseas player and take up such a slot in the team.

Also from The FA proposal:-
&gt; A reduction in the maximum number of non-home grown players permitted in a club’s first team squad of 25 from 17 to 13, phased over four years from 2016. This would have the effect of ensuring that in a squad of 25, 12 players would have to be home grown.

So instead of requiring 8 home grown, clubs are now going to need 12. This will push the price of qualifying players up again as clubs scramble to comply with the new rules. Although it'll be phased in over four years, it'll probably take longer than that to produce 4 players of the required quality through the youth systems. 

Remember, to qualify as home-grown under the new proposals, players would have to be registered with their club from at least the age of 15. This is why EPPP was pushed through, so EPL clubs could have easier access to players under 16 (and screw the League clubs in the process.):-

There are none, all news is biased in some way. I think the best you can do is mix it up between sources of bias, for example match reading the Guardian with the Times.

Some publications like the Economist are relatively neutral (but it is still biased). For US/World news you could read both the NYT and Washington Post to get both sides of their debate. It's worth having a look at Al-Jazeera and RT just to see the other side of debate and give yourself a new perspective - they balance out the Western bias of the BBC, but they are obviously biased themselves.

null,false,Phoenixinda,null,null,null,"This will just make people on benefits even more reluctant to get back to work and they'll either just die with a massive amount of debt or their children will inherit it creating a vicious cycle. 
There might be people who are on benefits simply because they can't be bothered to work, however I'm sure that more people would actually work if they had more incentives and if they could.
1. A living wage - you can't survive on minimum wage, pay rent, buy food for your family and just simply live. Most landlords require 30 times the rent to be equal or more than your salary and with properties in many places starting at 700 a month you need an annual income of 21000
2. Childcare - People can't go back to work if they have to spend 80-90% of their salary on childcare. There is a gap between a child being 6 months old and 3 years old where parents don't get maternity pay of free childcare in any form. A childminder costs around 4-5 pounds an hour, nurseries even more.
3 Skill set - It's all good to point the finger on people on benefits and shout get back to work when they have no marketable skills. If there was a plan to educate these people in proper skills like building work, the food industry, car mechanics, IT, teaching etc they would be more willing to go to work as they could have a career or a work they take pride in and pays better than working in a warehouse for example.
4. Charity - This might be me being idealistic, but a lot of charities need people to help if some people on benefits were to work with them it might help them gain some perspective.

I'm very happy that a big club signed him since i think he is a very good keeper, i honestly can't believe he's still not a PL regular by now.
He started his career at a Hungarian club called Vasas and was immediately seen as a very talented keeper. It didn't took long for a bigger club to steal him and he joined Bolton Wanderers in 2007 for an undisclosed fee. Of course as a young keeper he was mostly playing in the reserves and he then went to Crewe on loan which was honestly a terrible move for him as he was mostly second or third choice there. He remained at Bolton because they knew he's talented and with a little patience he can be a very good keeper in the future. He was always a great shot stopper, that earned him a call up to the national team where he started playing consistently as a first choice keeper. The breakthrough happened in 2011 for him at Bolton where he became the first choice keeper and after a handful amount of games everyone was delighted with his performances. He had an injury not too long ago that's why some think he wasn't first choice.

However this opportunity was always going to happen for him, he was destined to play in the PL some day, he's a passionate lad and i have no doubt in his minds right now he's thinking about how he could displace Mignolet in the goal.

Generally they are 2+ day blocks driving 5+ hours a day and all being well the practical test at the end. Price wise they tend to be around £300 to £400 (assuming you've had lessons before), with about £700 to £800 being the max at at a week in length. Most operate on a pass guarantee where if you fail you get free training until you do.                             
                              
If you mean you just booked 1h every Saturday and Wednesday for 10 weeks or so then its not intensive. You need at least 2h per lesson (you should get a discount over the 1h rate) as you'll have a lot more practical time in the car.               
Think about if your 1h lesson is 5 minutes talking about what your going to do during the lesson, 45 to 50 minutes driving, 5 to 10 minutes review. A 2h lesson has the same start and end routine, so instead of 10 to 15 minutes per hour non-driving time you have 5 to 8 minutes per hour.

null,false,the_ultravixens,null,null,null,"Well, those sentiments are nice and all, but they're completely incompatible with todays modern monetary system in which nearly *all* new money is created as debt when banks create loans.  A corollary of this is that as the economy has grown, so the total debt burden has grown.  This isn't necesarilly good or bad, debt is just a tool which can have productive and non productive pueposes.  If people only ""spent what they could afford"" then nobody would ever take out a mortgage on a house, for example.  It is perfectly normal for both public and private debt to increase as the size and needs of the population increase.  So long as the debt is used productively (build schools, hospitals or whatever) and not unproductively (speculating on a housing boom) then I would argue that it's a useful tool, which can help future generations by making sure that they've got functioning infrastructure.  Fact is the debt will never be paid back in aggregate, nor should we expect it to be, since that's not how the system works.

There's also the fact that the financial system is dependent on liquid government debt vehicle like treasury bonds to be used for liquidity management, and without a good stock of risk free financial assets (which government debt represents) things would turn very unstable indeed.  In fact I'd argue that the fact that governments have been pretty tight with issuing bonds in recent years (labour actually ran surpluses in the late 90's, and the line about them ""spending money like no tomorrow"" has no basis in fact, if one looks at the data) is one of the things that's helped produce the current housing market mess, since people can't save by acquiring government bonds.

Markovic probably didn't prove himself exactly as a capable wingback, but for me he proved that he has football brain and flexibility to succeed at the top level. We used him in a position which was up for grabs and he took it - he linked up well with players ahead, beside and further back of him, didn't lose possession much and worked hard to make the 3 at the back work. It was only a short term thing but I think the club and himself learned quite a bit from that experiment. Maybe he could've taken more risks in the final third, but the few times he did I thought he was intelligent with his choices.

It was alright for the club in short term, but I think that these minutes he got there were very valuable for him and he definitely takes that experience in his stride to do even better in the future. As you see my view of it is very idealistic with longer term biases.

Ten minutes later a hippie detaches himself from the nearest group of practicing acrobats and proceeds to *piss in the barbecue*.

When asked what he thought he was doing, he responded that he was being environmentally friendly, obviously! Then noticed our American flag and began yelling at us in his thick Scottish accent that America wasn't REALLY independent from the English, who did we think we were, England could've still had us Americans if they'd given a shit!

An emergency tax code (1060L X for this tax year, most other figures should be accurate for the 2014/2015 tax year) defaults your tax status to the full personal allowance and so you should only have been getting a small amount of tax deducted (later reclaimable). It seems that your 'employer' has assumed you had no personal allowance (by assigning you the tax code BR, usually given when you start your first job) and taken far too much tax (should, see last paragraph, still be reclaimable). The P46, and common sense, dictates they should have put you on some variant of the full allowance if they had done things properly.

* A gross monthly wage of £1,040.00 should result in monthly take home of around £953.43 for the last, 2014/15 tax year. The 6 Income Tax payments of £41.33 (total: £247.98) should be reclaimable assuming you ultimately earned less than the threshold for that tax year.

* If incorrectly taxed as though you had no personal allowance (BR or 0L) that £1,040 would indeed be reduced to £786.76. The 6 Income Tax payments of £208.00 (total: £1,248.00) should be reclaimable assuming you ultimately earned less than the threshold for that tax year.

The problem here is that your 'employer' seems to have been breaking some rules (e.g. reporting these figures to HMRC) which they *really* aren't supposed to break.

null,false,SlindsayUK,cnty-wales,Wales - Swansea,null,"I wrote a wall of text in another thread about why I think we're shafting students these days in comparisosn to the 80s that applies here:

First, the number of people who go to university is not 50% as many people think, it is not more than 40% and may be as low as 27% currently depending on the methodology you use:

http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/jun/04/higher-education-participation-data-analysis

Furthermore, in the 80s and 90s there were polytechnics but in 1992 they merged with the universities system which results in the largest single bump in the number of people participating in the higher education system but numbers on the awards from the polytechnices are hard to come by. Roughly speaking it looks like they account for about 13% of the current degrees awarded looking at this and simply subtracting the last year before they were counted from the first year they were:

http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/social-trends-rd/social-trends/social-trends-41/education-and-training.pdf

To put it another way, it's not a million miles from 25% of people engaging in some form of education after school - that's not a million miles from the 40% we have now as apprenticeships are uncommon. I know people will think that sounds like nonsense because it seems to be so improbable against the rise in student numbers but there's a few other things that affect this. The UK share of international students has grown massively in this time (they are now 1/3 of students in UK HEI) and the population has increased dramatically as well.

Another (possibly better) way of looking at this is looking at this though is in terms of expenditure on training and higher education:

http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/22738/1/SN02631.pdf

What you can see there is that the total UK expenditure on education has been growing very slowly with a spike in 2008 (that's because of the recession's affect on GDP though I think).

Finally, the other element of these numbers though is the number of jobs that require a degree. The number of jobs that demand a degree has grown from 10% in the mid 1980s to about 26% now. Meanwhile, at the same time, the number of jobs with no requirement for a degree have been in decline for years:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22268809


Finally, the Student Loan Company was only founded in 1990, prior to that point, students entering higher education received a grant from their Local Authority:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loans_in_the_United_Kingdom

So basically, the number of UK young adults getting some form of training after leaving school has increased slightly, the number of jobs requiring a degree has increased 150% times but the amount the country spends as a percentage of GDP on this education has only grown very slightly (max 20%) and the cost to the individual students has increased from being paid to go to Uni to £36,000 for a 3 year degree while as the same time removing substantial grants that a lot of the current population would have qualified for.

Every year there's a paper that is far more difficult than the ones from past years, for example as revision I did a maths paper where the A* boundary was 58 out of 75 (77%) when usually it's roughly 69/68/67. The nice thing is that more difficult papers are accounted for in the grade boundaries.

The only exception to this is a further maths module where, in around 2010 or so, the difficulty jumped a fair bit. The questions stopped being as formulaic and based on a method and started being about applying knowledge and thinking a bit more.

Moreno, Manquillo, Can and Markovic all moved country to a dramatically different footballing culture, and personal culture. It's a credit to Can and Moreno that they adapted so quickly. Bear in mind as well that Can and Manquillo weren't playing week-in, week-out football when we bought them. They had to adapt to that too. I think they will all play well, and cement themselves in the team, except Manquillo if we buy another RB.

Lovren is a different case; but put yourself in his shoes. He's arrived in England only one season ago, for a team that do pretty well and he plays well. He gets the move he wants. But suddenly the pressure is on him from day one to show why we spent the money on him. And Liverpool's expectations are WAY higher than Southampton, leading to even more pressure. He'll settle in this year. Calling it.

Balotelli won't. His game has been the same for 4 seasons now, and he won't change for anybody. Of course, the debate could be had, and has been had, about whether Rodgers should play to Balotelli's strengths (though to be quite honest, at the age of 24, I still don't really know what his are) or Balotelli should adapt. I'm of the opinion it should be the latter; ""No player is bigger than the team"" etc.

I don't think it's unfair to say that Mignolet is not of the same calibre of those listed. Considering that Rodgers has made no secret of his desire for a better goalkeeping option, we've not been seeking a backup for him as such, more somebody who can provide competition for his spot. 

While Bogdan may indeed provide some competition, he's not a bad keeper after all, I'd assume most are disgruntled as he's quite a known quantity and isn't realistically going to offer anything drastically different to Mignolet. 

Personally, I don't feel this signing can be considered a success in terms of what we were looking for in a new keeper.

""Between them, they will come up with an appropriate fee based on a number of factors. They would take into account the status of the club the player is leaving, the status of the club he’s joining, the amount of money the club paid when they signed him originally, the length of time he spent at the club and the terms of the contract offered to him by the club he’s at and the club he’s leaving.


They would also factor in his playing record including any international appearances, as well as any ‘substantiated interest’ shown by other clubs in signing him – as I mentioned earlier reported interest in a player could see the compensation amount rise.

The panel would also consider other costs, which Burnley would have to provide evidence of, including cost of training and playing facilities, education and welfare requirements, medical facilities, friendly and competitive matches as well as scouting and coaching fees. It’s impossible to guess a likely figure due to the amount of detail, but expect it to be lower than £12m.""

City ended up getting 8.3m (3.5m upfront + 3m add-ons + 15% sell on fee = 1.8m) for Sturridge, who had 0 International Caps when they sold him.

Another thing important to note, ""the length of time he spent at the club and the terms of the contract offered to him by the club he’s at and the club he’s leaving."" He'll have been at the club 7 years, his current contract is worth in excess of 8m and the contract we offer him in good faith in 2 years time (which he must formally decline to leave via tribunal) will likely be worth 26m minimum (5 years @100k/wk).",null,0,null,1434107380,null,0,1434109608,0,cs43r0d,null,t3_39kg21,null,t1_cs43r0d,null,t1_cs43jhf,null,null,null,1436935565,null,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12,null

The problem is you don't necessarily need a signed agreement for have a contract - you need to make sure you haven't agreed verbally/by conduct etc. So one person signing it is a problem, but at the end of the day the other two have not. One tenant cannot bind the other two to sign up. You are in a better position than C. 

My personal rule with estate agents is don't get drawn into an argument with them, when I have a dispute I just say ""this is what I am doing"" and ignore their response and just keep repeating myself - they don't know the law and frequently bend the truth in my experience. I never give them an inch - eg don't say *one* tenant hasn't agreed it its terms as they will just then focus on you and C. My approach would just be ""we don't agree to the proposed tenancy, end of"".

Also, when were you due to move in? If it is at least a few weeks away the lettinf agent may give up and find it easier to get new tenants in than fight you. They get their fees from you and another set from new tenants. 

Finally best adivce I can give - phone Shelter. They are really good at this stuff. Don't wait for a bigger mess before phoning them, don't speak to the letting agent again beforehand - just phone Shelter **today**.

I'm an Aerospace Engineering student with one year left (started before the fee hike thank god), and I've been told by my lecturers, on the down low, that it can cost anything up to £16,000 a year per student on my course. This sounds absurd but when you take a step back and look at the equipment/facilities we use, it begins to make sense; also I suspect that many of the engineering staff may be on higher wages than their counterparts in other departments, as they could jump ship to industry at any time and start making buckets.

&amp;nbsp;

Therefore, since i'm only paying £3300 a year (and other classmates £9000) plainly the only reason i'm able to take my course is because of humanities students paying £3300/9000 per year for a course that costs significantly less ...

null,false,_Brutal_Jerk_Off_,null,null,null,"&gt;Yes, we have to draw a line somewhere. But why 18?

18 is widely considered the age where you become an adult. At 16-17 most ""adult"" things, have to be done with parental consent, and therefore I would argue that they are not yet adults.



&gt; 16 is the end of secondary school, where people are then actually making choices for themselves with regards to their future.

It's a similar choice they and their parents made when they chose what secondary school to go to. Should 11/12 year old therefore have votes?

&gt;This is a choice regarding their future, so why shouldn't they be able to make it with the rest of us?

18 year olds + have the say, since it's all adults deciding the future. I do not want children of 16/17 deciding the future of the country, as they are not adults themselves. I mean, if you want, we could continue to delay the referendum 2 years, therefore all 16/17 year olds in 2017, would be able to vote in 2019...

&gt;Plus, has there been any evidence that it any way harmed the result of the Scottish referendum?

I think Scottish politics is very different from UK wide politics. I don't quite know what you mean by ""harmed the result"" . Not sure how it helps anyone, honestly.

FSG aren't going to back this window with stupid transfer money.  The way they're reportedly negotiating with Southampton over Clyne is evidence of that.  We're not going to be buying established star players.

So, regardless of who the manager is, our squad is going to be in flux next season as necessary new signings are bedded in to replace Gerrard, Johnson, Borini, and likely Balotelli.  Our defense needs reinforcement, so that we can play Can in his preferred position/s.

I do think that if the right manager could be found (say, someone with personal pull to entice great players to come to Anfield), then it would be worth taking that chance, even with the added upheaval, given the way the team didn't perform in the last part of the season.

I am a lawyer but not a data protection or privacy lawyer so take this with a grain of salt - I am assuming how this likely works in practice. 

Essentially, if you give an extract of data intercepted then the defence can request the full amount of data intercepted rather than just the extract. So the prosecution would need to devote significant man hours to the task of reviewing and disclosing intercepted data - man hours and cost it would need to redirect from other cases. So instead if they can prove guilt they do so without relying on the intercepted data at all. So saying that the defence team could use the full data intercepted to establish innocence is the reason for withholding intercepted data is pain wrong and sensationalist. 

That being said, if intercepted data plays any part in the investigation maybe it should be fully disclosed and the prosecution team should put up with the extra work and cost?

Example 1: Protestors. You head for a legal and democratic protest, in order to express your opposition to the Tories latest environmentally destructive schemes. Before you even arrive, a stingray box sitting in a police car detects your mobile phone in the area, your name is added to a watch list, and then that list could be used as a basis for further investigation into not just you, but also the people you know. For example they could combine this with intelligence from GCHQ to analyze the people you make phonecalls to, your facebook friends, the people you email etc. Are you comfortable with the police having a comprehensive dossier about your private life?

Example 2: You are a minor but rising Green politician. Perhaps you recently came second in a by-election. The local police decide to keep tabs on you. They use their stingray box to track your location over an extended period, and eventually work out that you are having an affair. They use this information to blackmail you, in order to reveal to them large amounts of insider information about local green groups.

What I do know is that it is our government policies in regards to financial regulation that allowed the banks to over stretch themselves so spectacularly, and I am not convinced that sufficient steps have been taken to ensure there won't be a repeat. In fact I'm quite convinced that sufficient steps have not been taken.

If the public are expected to bear all the losses and to provide bail-out's for private companies then I think it's reasonable that those entities provide a return for the risk we have taken. The debts we have taken. This would seem reasonable. But this is not what has happened. The banks, and the employees of those banks have taken on huge risks and they have avoided taking responsibility but they still take the rewards.

It's a shit system, they basically cannot lose. The public have lost quite tremendously, of course.

You make a good point, it is far too conceptually broad. I guess what I really care about is a Bhutan style goal of increasing and sustaining Gross National Happiness. I believe to achieve that we need to have the buying power to protect against war and disease, as well as sustain a steadily increasing rate of scientific research and development - providing modern amenities, services and technology to everybody (I also really see education as a part of that). This likely necessitates a decrease in economic disparity as the smaller this is the higher GNH is in a country (as far as I understand).

So when I say ""The economy"" I really mean meets or helps the broad goals set out above - I understand it's a bit of a tautology since it really contains education in itself.

In the report

&gt;An important post-1979 change that should be taken into account is the slowdown in growth in the volume of world trade in goods from the mid-1970s. A likely cause of the slowdown was the ending of the long recovery in the war-torn economies of Europe and Asia, but the switch to floating exchange rates may have played a role. We estimate that the growth in real per capita GDP in the UK would have slowed from 2.6% per annum to 2.2% per annum due solely to the impact of slower growth in the volume of world trade. Assessed against this more slowly growing benchmark trend, per capita GDP in the UK exceeded the trend in the late 1980s and in all years from 1994 to 2008. 

In her editorialising

&gt;The authors say that even allowing for factors such as the slowing in growth of world trade, the evidence for an absolute improvement in UK economic performance after 1979 is “at best mixed”. Similarly, they reject arguments in support of liberal market reforms made on the basis of the UK’s relative performance.

Also I take exception that she can't even use the archives from the Guardian herself

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/datablog/2013/apr/08/britain-changed-margaret-thatcher-charts

&gt;Perceived wisdom is also that manufacturing disappeared under Thatcher. If so, it was something that had already started. In 1970, manufacturing accounted for 20.57% of UK GDP. By 1979 that was down to 17.62% of GDP. By the time she left office, that decline had continued - albeit at a slightly slower pace, down to 15.18%. Now it is much lower, according to the ONS - down to 9.68% in 2010.

Put the lid on, shake for few seconds, and done. That'll make enough for several salads. A couple of tablespoons on yours tonight and you'll be set.

You can take that basic idea and do all kinds of stuff. Instead of balsamic try red wine vinegar. Or add honey and use dijon mustard for a honey mustard dressing. Or finely dice shallot, use lemon juice for the acid and add some herbs for a french dressing. Loads of possibilities. It's always ( acid + fat + emulsifier + flavourings = delicious dressing ).

&gt; Fasting is not obligatory for young children, until they reach the age of adolescence

&gt; The age at which parents should start to teach their children to fast is the age at which they are able to fast, which will vary according to each child’s physical makeup.

&gt; the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined smacking children for not praying at this age, and regarding fasting as being like prayer is better, because they are close to one another, and because they are both physical actions that are pillars of Islam. But fasting is harder, so attention should be paid to when the child becomes able for it, because some may be able to pray who are not yet able to fast.

&gt; it is not permissible to force them to fast if it will harm them in cases of physical weakness or sickness.

null,false,sireel,eng-Bristol,County of Bristol (now in Portsmouth),null,"&gt; Well what did you expect? A free year and a half of university?

No. The Student loan covers four years of tuition (even if you take a three year degree). I was aware that I was going to have to pay for a year of tuition, what I was not aware of (and no-one at the university nor the LEA even mentioned) was that in the case of starting a new degree after the second year, you are expected to pay for the *first* year of your new degree, and they will cover the last two. This mean that I had (If I remember correctly) about 3 months notice that I needed to find 3129GBP in order to not get kicked off the course.

They wouldn't let me pay for the final year, because 'working to pay the debt would disrupt my studies and likely result in failure' (actual quote). So instead of having two years to save up, I had zero time, and no-one to borrow from. I worked four jobs for the time I had to get the money together.

As for the money, Rent and bills for a room in a house of five people , plus about 30 quid a week on food and household crap ran me about 4100GPB. Textbooks not included (of which I needed many). Paper not included. Replacement computer parts needed for my PC (which broke down a number of times) not included.

I left that place shortly afterwards and managed to pass the reference checks at the next place without issues so hopefully you will be fine.

Many people have supported Chelsea their whole lives. However since Chelsea have become successful they have attracted a lot of oversea fans, whether it be from the US, Nigeria, Singapore etc. Because these fans started supporting Chelsea after the success, they are seen as ""glory hunters"" as they have no connection to the club whatsoever other than they decided to root for the winning team. The dislike isn't because you're American, but because most foreign fans didn't start following until after 2003 and you're all getting chucked under the same label.

You could be as much a fan as Steve from South West London but unfortunately it doesn't look that way to someone who doesn't know you.  

This increase in fans post-2003 also means that poor old Steve is also considered a glory hunter by the other fans just for being a Chelsea fan, even though he's been to every home match since he turned 10. This might lead to Steve resenting the post-2003 fans as they've (unintentionally) created the idea that Chelsea fans are plastic flag waving glory hunters.

I personally couldn't care less what other fans think. But I am often curious as to why American fans don't choose an MLS team.",null,0,null,1434115177,null,0,false,0,cs46gsi,null,t3_39kn7w,null,t1_cs46gsi,null,t1_cs45cwz,null,null,null,1436937181,null,16,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,16,null

The issues are too complex so there's no point debating it 8 years down the road. Basically the problem as I see it is that the banks were insufficiently regulated to avoid this scenario arising. And this still seems to be the case.

Selling off this asset now seems like a tremendously shit way for a perpetual organisation like government to deal with RBS. They should simply hold on to the shares and improve regulation to ensure the bank can return to sustainable profits without putting all our heads in the noose with quadrillions of iffy bullshit.

It may take another 10 or 20 years, but RBS have prospects for legitimate business without irresponsible risk taking.

First off a lot of people on this sub don't want to think about how to fit someone into the squad, they just see a name that they recognize and want to sign them at all costs.

A lot of people also think Liverpool are/should be in the top 4 every year and to achieve that a lot of the players currently in the squad aren't good enough to be starting in a top 4 squad.

Another reason could be a lot of people for some reason don't rate milner and think Kovacic should be starting instead of him regardless of what reality might actually be.

Lets be honest here a majority of the comments on transfer threads are about how bad Liverpool signings are and if Liverpool doesn't sign world class players then the players they do sign must be shit.

The reality is your post made some very valid points that the casual fan ignores or doesn't want to believe is true.  I personally don't agree with the reasons above, but with a large group of people with little knowledge on a topic those are the reactions you get. 

Though on a side note I would say Ibe, Allen, Ballotelli, Origi and maybe even Markovic should all have to earn a place in the team, not be automatically chosen.  Liverpool does have a lot of depth in certain areas, but the problem is none of the players are very consistent so its hard to properly manage the squad (ie loaning out young players or selling players that should be surplus).

Im in the process of rewatching all of the league matches. What I have taken from it so far is that improving the defense should be a huge concern this summer. Without the presence of at least one offensive threat from a wingback well never be able to reach the level of Bayern, Real and Barca. 

I know people think that Ivanovic gets forward a lot, and he did get 4 goals and 6? assissts, but it isnt enough for the amount of time and space  he gets going forward. The games against teams who park the bus all have a very similar trend of most of the midfield and Costa moving the ball around the opponents third without really getting into the box and threatening areas. And when they do it takes spectacular efforts. (although it makes for some really pretty goals, Schurrle v Burnley, Costa v Newcastle, Fabregas v Palace)

Throughout these matches the most common outball is to ivanovic who is usually unmarked. Why is he unmarked? Usually it is because Hazard is double marked or Willian has drifted centrally to get on the ball. Now ask yourself this, If the other teams thought Ivanovic was a threat going forward would he be unmarked? Would they leave someone like Dani Alves, Marcelo or Alaba unmarked? no. 

Either Luis needs to start and move Dave to the right or bring in someone who would start on the left. Because a consistent, real threat going forward from a wingback would bring us to the next level. And Ivanovic doesnt offer it. 

I have a lot of thoughts on this if people would be interested in a couple of posts that review  every game or maybe every couple games? ",null,0,null,1434115670,null,0,false,0,cs46p8w,null,t3_39kn7w,null,t1_cs46p8w,null,t3_39kn7w,null,null,null,1436937359,null,17,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,17,null

&gt;I'll start by saying that i'm far from being anti-Sterling. Now that's out of the way, the golden boy means dick all. Balo won it, even Anderson won it and he spent his career sitting on utd's bench eating pies. 

Messi won it, Fabregas, Aguero, Rooney, Gotze, Isco, Pogba all won it. It doesn't mean dick all. It's a pretty accurate barometer for how players will fare. 


&gt;As it stands Sterling is still trading on his potential, which he has plenty of but until he actually delivers on it nothing is guaranteed. 

He's 20 years old, he did well for us this season, considering the burden he's had to bear. what does delivering on potential mean? Does that mean Pogba, Isco and Gotze aren't guaranteed to be stars? Because they haven't delivered on their potential yet?

&gt;He could go on to be world class, he could also end up being a solid pro for a top 10 side. As Balo has shown in his career you need more than raw talent to become a top player.

Extremely low chance he doesn't go on to be a great player. He's got more than just the raw talent, the kid works extremely hard. Always learning, we've seen how much work he's put in, in regards to him improving his strength. Is he ill advised? Yes. But as long as he takes care of himself which he is doing, there's no reason why he won't be world class.

Many won't understand that English football is deeply rooted in actually _supporting_ a club. That means actually going to a game helped keep that football club alive in the first place. It meant throwing coins in a bucket during the 'Save The Bridge' campaign when the club was days from going down the shitter, among many, many other things which are a part of the club's history that a lot of fans don't care for. For some it meant getting into huge amounts of debt to follow and support the club they love. 

To follow the club and go to games - which will always be a _far_ better experience than watching a game on TV - costs thousands, but to watch a stream costs nothing but time, even if it might be at an ungodly hour. When a match-going supporter sees someone complaining about someone having to get up at an unsociable hour to watch a match on a stream or the TV, they smile and think about the fact that they've had to take a day off work because there are no trains beck from Hull until the morning after a Monday night kick-off.

It's a complete lifestyle choice.

Things are very different these days for many reasons, but a lot of people still make a clear distinction between fans and supporters. 

When someone says buy a True Blue Membership because you're supporting the club, that's exactly what you're doing as it's a revenue stream. When someone says buy merchandise from official channels, that's because you know you'll be getting the genuine article _and_ you're supporting the club as it's a revenue stream.

I'm sure there are many other reasons, but that's just a couple I know personally to be true from the many conversations I've had down the years. 

I don't actually give a toss where people are from. I've got tickets for and taken travelling fans from the US, Australia and Europe to matches before. Without exception, they are people I've come to know well through various channels and I know their love for the club is indisputable. 

That last sentence is important: there's another reason people get on the case of 'new' fans; it's because many of the new fans have no concept of the idea that people like myself and many others are actually living the dream because we saw the club when it was really, really bad - on and off the pitch - so winning trophies every season will _never_ be a given, nor will it be a reason to change our views on the club.

As to your last sentence, the reason why a lot of us didnt choose a MLS is because of 3 reasons. 

One, and its the simpliest, is that the quality of play was terrible. 

Two, because when youre growing up and you idolize about all your stars, where do they play? Europe, maybe South America, but certainly not America. When your football heroes are people like Zidane, Lampard, Beckham, Gerrard, or Drogba, youre naturally attracted to the clubs players like this play for. 

Lastly, our fathers didnt take us to soccer games, they took us to (american) football and baseball games. The same love and support and lack of a choice for a club from birth was instilled in us Americans, but for different sports. Once we discovered our love for soccer, we finally had a choice.

I'm a mile down my road before I get my pants pulled all the way up and my contacts become clear. I drove through a semi blind stop sign going about 60.
