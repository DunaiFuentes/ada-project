Suppose 50% of people enjoy X in a movie, 45% don't care and 5% despise X to the extent that they vociferously complain and threaten boycotts and the like.  A movie studio could well decide that it's easier to give in to the 5%.  It could even make good business sense for them.  Why?  Because, even though 50% like X, they're probably still going to go even if it's removed.

His argument seemed to be perceived by the audience as ""all people with a mental illness are Scroungers"" and he didn't do enough to address that. If that is truly what he thinks then he's an idiot but it looked more like he just panicked and tried to act the big man which backfired massively.

He was also ranting on about cutting benefits to ensure there's a difference between minimum wage jobs and people on benefits.

Halal food is nice, anyway. My dinner tonight was a Halal curry, which I bought from some people who are Muslims.  

However, I also like bacon, sausages, and black pudding.   

I think it *is* a little bit sinister that grey business calculations have here resulted in a large group of children effectively eating Halal food whether they are Muslims or not. I would also think it were sinister if the result was Muslim children having to eat Haram food. 

I know it's a difficult task to work out how to supply an entire London Borough's primary schools with school dinners, and whoever is in charge of that probably wants to do it in the simplest way that guarantees quality. I can see it's simpler just to not have pork on the menu. 

And possibly the only reason anyone ever ate black pudding was because they had some pig blood and ears knocking around after having made the sausages and bacon, which is itself a grey business calculation. 

Consider though if everything were done according to the law of supply and demand. Then we might say, 

'Look, teenage school kids who are gay, why don't you just stay in the closet? Most of your peers are homophobic, so it stands to reason to keep the gay stuff out of public view', or 

'Look, the majority of kids in this district read the Mass in Latin. Why don't you protestant kids stop trying to read it in English when it would all be much simpler to have one reading in one language?'

I think what's holding him back to be a Ronaldo-esq player is his size, Ronaldo is good because of his physique, and how he controls the game on his speed and physicality alone. Hazard can take on runs and beat half the squad which always makes him dangerous.

Messi is just out of this world though. He's hazard with more skill, better decision making, and just better in general.

I think the only thing stopping him from becoming a Messi/Ronaldo known player is his decisions and stats. He's got the skill (not on Messi's level), it's just he doesn't get the goals and assists that is needed for people to say so.

Obviously that means a lot more than what I'm saying. He isn't making the chances which means he isn't getting those stats padded. I still just think it will come with time as he plays. Definitely finishing will come with time, he's a fantastic play maker though.

But to say the thing holding him back is just his penetration in the box is bullshit.",null,0,null,1423783130,null,0,false,0,cojqa8a,null,t3_2vpb1e,null,t1_cojqa8a,null,t3_2vpb1e,null,null,null,1424557497,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

---

&gt;

&gt;__Savant syndrome__ is a condition in which a person demonstrates profound and [prodigious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy) capacities or abilities far in excess of what would be considered normal.   

&gt;People with savant syndrome may have [neurodevelopmental disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodevelopmental_disorder), notably [autism spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum) disorders, or [brain injuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_injury). The most dramatic examples of savant syndrome occur in individuals who score very low on [IQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient) tests, while demonstrating exceptional skills or brilliance in specific areas, such as rapid calculation, art, memory, or musical ability.     Although termed a [syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome), it is not recognized as a [mental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder) nor as part of mental disorder in [medical manuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_manual) such as the [ICD-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10)  or the [DSM-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5).

I just can't stand idle while I hear you reel off how sure you are about the market and investments - nothing is certain! Just remember the two most important factors of your portfolio are: 1. how long until you need to access the funds, 2. your attitude to risk. 

&gt; Last year I made 5% in 3 months which was a real record for me, things started slipping in around September though and I lost a lot of faith in the stock market (even though it always is a gamble).

So how much did you make across the term of the investment? That's the single most important factor. Heck I've seen one 'low risk' corporate bond fund increase 3% last month alone! Don't try to justify your investment of one single good period. It's a bit like gambling, in fact it is. 

Then you go on to list the reasoning of each investment. That sounds great in practice, but if you look hard enough you will find most stocks are supported by one blog or another. Each have their own different investment strategies. I appreciate that it sounds like you are investing in individual stocks because you feel like its 'enjoyable' and 'fun'. Amateur stock picking isn't going to beat the market return over the long term (if it does you should probably be getting paid), in the short term its possible but usually the risk/return ratio isn't justifiable. 

&gt; Index funds also (more or less) mirror the FTSE, I find index funds boring - you can't buy and sell by the second, fluctuations are tiny

Eh index funds are not exclusively mirroring the FTSE. Plenty of worldwide index funds, and plenty 'more risky' index funds which may also suit your risk appetite. 

&gt;  if your portfolio can beat the FTSE and remain ahead, you'll always beat an index.

This is not true. Why do you think Warren Buffet invests in index funds? You will not always beat an index. I don't understand why you are so sure about your investments, especially considering your high risk attitude towards individual stocks. Yes they are low risk stocks, but investing in a low number of stocks is far more riskier than an index or bonds. 

&gt; I've become more interested in guaranteed profit now 

So why are you considered about dividend payouts? Accumulation funds - surely? 

&gt; in guaranteed profit now I'm looking at investing in a home which shares will never do.

Investing in a home? Guaranteed profit? So many factors come into play its hard to say its guaranteed.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing Skrtel, but the other lads are ahead of Skrtel from an ability standpoint. I think how good the player actually was over his time for the club has to be taken into account before you consider appearances and trophies.

Riise has a long list of trophies and appearances to his name, however I don't think you can automatically call him a legend.

He does. The issue is this, and it's very simple: people see the likes of Ronaldo and Messi doing these sweet things with the ball, but they see the highlights. The people who watch them every week for 90 minutes know that sort of thing is impossible every time they have the ball, and thank god for that.

The problem is not with Hazard, it's with your perception of the way he plays and how it doesn't fit with your idealised version of football. 

I read this sort of thing a lot and generally give it a massive swerve because if anything like this idealised view were real, what we'd really be saying about players is that they're flat-track bullies or defenders are all shit. It's bad enough as it is as Chelsea's opposition is so rarely given credit here - when we don't batter teams the view is very often that we were shit, not that the opposition came with a plan and executed it well.

It reminds me a great deal of Zola. Many argue he's Chelsea's greatest player, and I can see why, but as someone who watched him week in week out from the stands, I can tell that at times he was one of _the_ most frustrating players to watch, but such moments are forgotten the next time he tries something outrageous and it works.

So this is why they word it the way they do. If you want pork we'll work with you. Meaning, we'll bring in your odious pork from an outside provider just to make you happy if you really insist. And that's for the school to insist on, not the individual. So really, it's hard to see the practical difference. This just looks like the school covering its back but really what has actually happened, like it or not, is that the majority principle has prevailed. The majority gets to impost its will on the minority. Also, the offence principle kicks in. We can't have you cooking pork in this kitchen because it offends our religion.

Previously, GardoÈ made 81 appearances for Steaua BucureÈti, winning the league and competing in the Champions League with the side. As part of the Romanian national team, his 14 appearances have mainly been confined to friendlies, but has a couple of EURO qualifiers to his name.

After initially struggling for playing time from injury and other CB's being favoured, he made his first start on 23^rd September in a 2-1 League Cup victory against Arsenal at the Emirates, and has begun to prove his worth as a stalwart of defence ever since, with the side failing to lose in all 10 matches that he has featured in so far.
 
GardoÈ is a large physical presence at the back who has no fear of committing to the big tackles, with the ability to carry the ball up-field if necessary.

No that *is* my point, that it's not pointless. Not in this election, not in any election. You need to stop thinking about it as one vote, you're part of a larger system.

Take the Greens for example - they probably won't win many seats (if any) but it seems like they may get more votes in this election (with the Lib Dems being less of a protest vote). That gets them more publicity over the next five years (similar to how Ukip have in the past few years).

And what's the problem with thinking long term? Either you vote and your party gets more votes/publicity in future, or you don't vote and nothing ever changes. What do you lose by voting?

And heres something to take into consideration. Its not really fair to compare Neymar and Hazard in my opinion because

1) Chelsea's opposition. If you look at the games prior to Willian's fantastic form, the opposition would shift most of their defensive focus onto Eden's side. Why? Because firstly he's fucking crazy good, there's always two men on him. Secondly, because Willian offered little to no threat on the right wing. He'd often dribble a bit, cut to either side and pass it back to Matic/Fabregas. Rinse and repeat. There was no worry for the opposition of a threat from Willians side so they could put most of their focus on Eden. Neymar doesnt have this issue as much because there's Messi, Suarez, Iniesta, etc.. all to worry about for whoever they are playing against. Watch Barca's games, Neymar rarely has more than one person on him. Messi gets most of the attention.

2) Defensive responsibilities. In a Mourinho team, everyone puts in a shift, everyone contributes equally and everyone does defensive work. Hazard is constantly tracking back to defend, closing down opposition, and helping out Dave on the flanks. To be honest, the fact that he's still shining despite all this is really fucking impressive to me. This is something Mou worked on with him since last year, and now he does a lot more defensive work. He doesn't have the luxury that Neymar has to just sit on the flanks and launch wave after wave of attacks. This is also one of the reasons I don't think he will get a Ballon D'or at Chelsea, because if he continues in the same play style, he won't be getting bags of goals and assists, (which is what the Ballon D'or weighs heavily). This favours Neymar a lot. Lamps was really close to winning one had it not been for Dinho, but he was just something else, an unnatural ability to just keep scoring and scoring..

Keep in mind, I am in no way saying that Eden won't be the best player in the world, he certainly has the potential and tools to do it, but to win a Ballon D'or is a different story. Despite how impactful his contributions would be, no matter how many times he drags defenders with him and dribbles past,creates space and chances, no matter how consistent he is, launches counter attacks and gives the ""assist to the assist"", It won't be as appreciated as someone like Neymar doing fancy moves and scoring goals left and right. 

Someone on this sub once said that Hazard is the chef, Fabregas is the waiter, and Costa's the customer.

No, of course not.  I think you're missing my point a bit, I'm talking about ideology more than policy, and I'm talking about a straw-man Tory ideology based on an apocraphyal/misattributed quote, not actual Tory ideology per se.

I haven't studied the period but if you told me a historian of the post-war decades studying the rise of the car in britain concluded that in terms of rhetoric and policy the labour governments absolutely matched the conservative ones for pro-car ness (building roads, car-centric urban planning, etc), I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised.

Mass car ownership was so complex and transformative, I think you could as well argue it was a case of Americanisation, or an inevitability in the timeline of (post)industrialisation, or whatever, as try and argue it was a right-wing idea.

On the other hand it's not that crazy to suggest that broadly speaking, individualism and high personal wealth/ownership are associated with the political right.

And fast forward to the 80s when the quote supposedly arose.  Thatcher is well in power, Thatcherist ideology is mainstream; car ownership is no longer an exciting new thing, it's now taken a sort of default - certainly something people should _aspire to_ by default, even if they don't actually have one yet.  

The hypothetical socialist says: all the people must have the freedom to get around - they need transport - we shall provide buses!

The hypothetical Thatcherite says: all the people must have the freedom to get around, by having the opportunity to own their car, by living in a society where cars are within reach of any decent working person etc.

Hypothetical socialist looks at a man on a bus and says: ah, good, my buses are serving the people.

Hypothetical Thatcherite looks at a man on a bus concludes one of two things.  Either that the man is a failure (as in the apocryphal quote as generally wielded by critics, because it makes Thatcher(ism) look cruel) because he hasn't earnt enough to get a car yet.  Or of course, more subtly, they may conclude that 'society'/politics/etc has failed him by denying him a fair opportunity at car ownership, perhaps due to excessive taxation / market interference in the supply of cars, or whatever other reason they identify that's consistent with their ideology.

We recently signed Gary Mackay-Steven (Incredibly good dribbler of the ball and does skill moves regularly) he and Stuart Armstrong both scored on their debut this week after signing from Dundee United so watch out for those.

Others in midfield are Brown(Club legend, Captain of Scotland &amp; Celtic and anchor for the team), Johansen who is a playmaker and Bitton a promising young Israeli defensive mid. 

He's not been playing as well as last aeason but Kris Commons is another big player for us, he outscored our strikers and won player of the year last season.

Our defence is shaky at times but stronger than the last couple of seasons,  centre backs Virgil Van Dijk and Jason Denayer (on loan from Man City) are both receiving praise for their performances(both players are on the brink of being capped for The Netherlands and Belgium respectively, van dijk linked with move to the premier league for a fee in excess of Â£10 mil)

Our Keeper is Craig Gordon, he joined for free after 2 years without a club following bad injuries when he played for sunderland(Joined them for Â£9mil which was the record for a British keeper at the time) He has been immense and is on track to equal the clean sheet record set by our last keeper Fraser Forster who almost broke the all time British record for most time without conceding a goal last season.

Our manager is Ronny Deila, a Norwegian in his 30's that was scouted by Man City as potential staff before he joined us, his shaky start to the season saw a lot of people calling for him to be sacked but he turned it around and is loved by fans. His assistant is John Collins a former celtic player who is also well liked by fans.

This is just a general overview of the current season, if you have any other questions I'll try my best to answer, you're picking a good time to start supporting Celtic, the treble is a possibility this year and although it's only the Europa league a tie in Europe with Inter Milan(The team Celtic beat to win the European cup in Lisbon in 1967 The first British team to win the cup) is just coming up.

Personal experience: went to directors of the company with my concerns. They told me I was overreacting. 

Went to NHS, they told me I should leave my job because it'd look like I was involved in fraud and also activity that was endangering public life. Yes this wasn't just about money but also patient safety. 

End result: I left company as I was advised by the NHS. Colleagues who came to me with concerns that I had documented and taken to the Director were forced to leave their jobs one at a time. The company still trading with no sanctions. They are free to risk patient lives and defraud the NHS. 

Only people who have suffered because of this were the people who came forward by raising concerns.

The organisation caused the NHS to overspend by Â£500,000 in 6 months. All the NHS did was recuperate Â£5000 for a separate crime regarding some stolen prescriptions.

null,false,joylongdivision,null,null,null,"Pelle. 29. Striker. Hair.

Joined from Feyenoord where he had previously played under Ronald Koeman, the 29 year old Italian international got off to a hell of a start, winning the PL Player of the Month for September. He hasn't been able to find that form since (speaking as of early February), but remains a important cog in the Southampton offensive machine.

From a playstyle perspective, Pelle is an interesting one. He lacks the engine of fellow Southampton strikers like Shane Long, Jay Rodriguez, or Sadio Mane, but brings to the table great hold up play, good aerial ability, and a willingness to drop into the midfield, interchange, and receive the ball that way. As a result, when Pelle leaves the field late-game in favor of some more active or aggressive players like Shane Long, his hold up play is severely missed. At times, without Pelle on the field, the style becomes more direct as a result, as in Koeman's pure playmaker-less system, he ends up sometimes linking the midfield and attack in a way Tadic, Mane, Elia, or Long do not.

As a result, even when not scoring goals, Pelle has managed to be productive in other ways. Though rarely making the final pass for an assist, he has a knack for a first-time flick to relieve pressure, or often makes unselfish runs to drag defenders away and allow someone else a clearer shot or path to goal. 

As far as similar players go, Pelle is relatively unique in style, but slightly similar to Arsenal's Olivier Giroud. Neither are particularly clinical finishers, nor do they have much of a poacher's instinct, but both involve themselves in the midfield build-up, and can pick a pass and send wingers in on goal in a way not many other strikers in the league can.

The Government agreed through the usual channels for Labour's environmental safeguards to be added to the Bill in its final reading in the Commons, because Labour and some coalition backbenchers (primarily Lib Dems) had been threatening to instead vote for an amendment that would have instituted a moratorium on all fracking until the next Parliament.

The Bill, which unusually started life in the Lords (making me suspect that the Government had planned this all along) then went back to the Upper House for its agreement - but once there the Government unpicked many of the agreed Labour safeguards completely, and significantly watered down the rest.

On its return to the Commons, Labour were completely out of options - this time they could only discuss the Lords amendments and not make any more substantive changes to the Bill.  The Lib Dems fell back into line, as is their wont, and Labour were faced with Hobson's choice - accept it or vote against it knowing they'd fail.  They (probably more honourably) chose the latter.

A CSC is best, but if you can't do that, this is what I've done since 2002? 

Celtic was the first team in any sport to do online streaming of games, and now of course every league does it, and that's cut back on the product, but it's the easiest sure-fire way to get the games in a good picture quality and support the club. 

You can go with shoddy streams, but I wouldn't. They'll also show some matches on Fox Sports 1 occasionally, but unless this team moves out of Scotland you won't get games on ""free"" TV regularly for some time again with the rights all over the place.

2. the CMs in a diamond cover a lot more ground and are often dragged out wide by opposition wingers / fullbacks. The 2 CM band in a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-4-2 is more central and possibly deeper too. So, the transitions in midfield and sequences of build up play would be different.

3. 2 strikers vs 1 roaming forward

4. 2 CBs vs 3 CBs

Everything changes, basically. I don't think Rodgers is the kind who impulsively chops and changes his system. He's more the kind who works on a system, implements it, and allows it to grow.

Again - X can stand for anything which causes offense.  It doesn't matter.

People certainly have organized boycotts and protests against movies/books/music because they have been offended.  For instance, offense taken at the song 'Blurred Lines' caused some people to ban it from campuses in the US and the UK.

&gt;why would Subway be opposed to something that brings them more sales?

Because there is a principle at stake.  If 5% of your customers are offended by X then let them get annoyed, but you don't have to remove X from the options for everyone else.  And giving into whiners shows to other groups that you are spineless.  It promotes a culture in which everyone will whine about everything in order to get their own way.

In the case of schools it's even more important.  Children of Muslim parents have to know that they live in a nation which has customs which do not adhere to Islamic rules.  Better they find out now than later.

Tax avoidance is completely legal. You should do as much of it as you can because (a) everybody else is, so to pay you fair share you must be passing your minimum legal possible (b) loop holes will only be found and closed because they cost hmrc revenue - if those holes are open and unfair, why should some get to use them but not others?

That Fink might be dodgy (and that would be evasion not avoidance) is irrelevant. He is correct that avoidance is commonplace.

Don't let politicians convince you that tax avoiders are in the wrong. They're the ones who can write laws, they can close whatever tax avoidance scheme they want with a flick of a pen.

The BBC news website is a vital part of my day. I love listening to Radio 4, from the comedy panels, to the financial advice, to the documentaries.  A couple weeks ago, I was listening to the This American Life podcast, and they aired a BBC  documentary about William Burroughs.  The host had this to say about the programme:

&gt;...the sheer craft of this documentary was just a thing to behold...I have never heard anything like it. It's one of the best hours of radio I heard last year, and one of the most original.

I'm sure Ira Glass has heard a lot of radio is his day, but it kind of captures what I felt when I first heard a BBC documentary being replayed on CBC radio.  

Radio 1 can even be okay on occasion, but it astounds me how many artists get their break on Radio 1.  The Big Weekend must make so many kids so psyched since the tickets are free, the artists are what they want to listen to, and it's seems to be in places that don't normally get festivals.

Markets are very good when you have a clearly idendtified customer / service user and rapid feedback is provided. The service user / customer being informed is also pretty vital. Works great for things like shoes and food, less so for health care or long term investments.

I'd check out 'Adapt' by Tim Harford, he would agree with alot of what you say, but also acknowledge the limitations to the unrestrained market.

Schools that are run like businesses can't hit the multiple 'bottom lines' that the multitude of stakeholders or customers or whatever you want to call them demand from them. The state may want a host of different things, from cheap education to indoctrination to economic growth for an area from the school. The parents may want good quality education / childcare / indoctrinations / social mobility. None of these things are easy to define or deliver, and can't be operationalised into cash ideas so readily.

Dang just look at health care and transport, there may be the odd exception, but as a rule public transport and healthcare is delivered much more efficiently monetarliy and to a higher quality around the globe. The UK's transport system is a joke compared to Europe, ditto with the US when it comes to health care. State eduation is far better in countries which have removed the market from education.

Obviously that's a gross oversimplification, maybe some areas of healthcare / education / whatever can be improved with marketisation, but as a rule of thumb probably not. The bottom line is though, the welfare state, government or whatever you want to call it is not simply a business, it is much bigger and more complex than that.",null,0,null,1423819820,null,0,false,0,cok5mqu,null,t3_2vj1sm,null,t1_cok5mqu,null,t1_cojshir,null,null,null,1424564739,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

then leave that person, if you don't like the terms for which you are being treated you leave and go with someone who offers what you are looking for.

If someone threatens you with violence for leaving that is a criminal offense in itself hence this completely ridiculous definition of ""abuse"" is nonsense.

A relationship where one person earns and the other doesn't if either partner is unhappy with the situation they are perfectly within their rights to leave and partner with someone who offers them what they are seeking, if they cant find a partner like that they can stay alone.

the state does not nor should not guarantee a relationship or a quality of a relationship outside of physical or criminal behaviour such as violence or imprisonment.

provided everyone has the protected right to be free from violence and false imprisonment (i.e by the partner) then your inability to leave is your issue not the states, 

I have and should have every right to claim any money i earn is mine and if you do not like that you can not be with me, but if you want my love or affection that is the condition i set and i have every right to do so.

in friendship i can do that in sexual relationships i can do that, in love i can do that.

provided your right to leave is not in question (through threats of violence etc) then what terms you accept for affection/love is your business not the states.

That's more the discussion I wanted to have, not a Hyypia vs Skrtel debate, I did say that I wasn't putting them in the same bracket. 

It's hard though because there haven't been that many in the past 20 odd years simply because Carra and Hyypia dominated the CB for so many years and I'm only 21 so it's tricky to compare to players older than that because I've never seen them play. Phil Babb? Steve Staunton? I would probably put Jan Molby on a level higher than them but having never seen them play, I'm only saying that because I know Molby still does a lot of articles and pieces about the club.

 Also, does the fact that Skrtel has been at the club now for almost 8 years and probably would've been a starting player the whole time had it not been for Carragher mean that he's a standard of player that might be classified as a great player for LFC? note,  not an LFC great but a great player for the club",null,0,null,1423821656,null,0,false,0,cok608v,null,t3_2vo2si,null,t1_cok608v,null,t1_cojld05,null,null,null,1424564914,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

These people aren't traditionally, or currently, as concerned with the issues you mentioned, at least not half as concerned as young people. They might understand the issues, but I've yet to meet many of them who seem to put these things on any great level of importance. It's disappointing.

Until young people vote,  fanciful speculation about social mobility and all the sensible things young people have a right to be concerned about will continue to be ignored - just like (I bet!) they will be ignored after this election is over and whatever crazy outcome we end up resumes normal service.

I'd prefer it weren't like that myself...

The things you mentioned will have to be dealt with at some point, but not until the voters make them a real priority and vote for parties that actually represent them. The two main parties don't really give a damn about finding real solutions to these problems, some of which can be explained by the focus on short-term politics that plagues Westminster (must win this byelection, then this one, etc etc) but also by the fact that the leaders don't see the need to undertake massive, fundamental, sweeping change towards what is, let's face it, wealth redestribution. They don't have the mandate for that, they have a consistent mandate for largely maintaining the status quo without entirely fucking it up. That's an admittedly negative assessment, but I'm fairly cynical.

That and ideological differences driven by fears in sending the global economy into panic - which are to some extent fair enough if you're happy to continue the grand experiment. As it stands, voters, despite what they might say, still seem happy enough to continue the grand experiment. There are obviously a billion other things going on that would conspire against change on that level, but none of them are as big a problem as voters simply not voting for it in the first place.",null,0,null,1423821914,null,0,1423823297,0,cok6236,null,t3_2vr3ti,null,t1_cok6236,null,t3_2vr3ti,null,null,null,1424564937,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null
null,false,religionisanger,null,null,null,"This is deviating quite a lot from the original point. I also don't really have much to add, some people managed their own shares, others buy into an index, I'm in the former camp and it's done OK for me, but now I'm stopping - I've no interest in a fund/index/tracker as it's been crap for me this year and I'm looking for an alternative investment strategy with more guarantees; this post was about that, I didn't come here to discuss my stock selection or my thoughts on select select vs fund shares. I will however respond to your point as best I can you've been quite friendly and polite, rather than take a pop at me.

In my opinion self selection (whilst more risky) has been more profitable and this been the experience for the past 5 years or so of me selecting shares. I once joined a share club and we discussed purchases together (mostly focussing on AIM), this worked well for us as well, but in all honesty, it was expensive - discuss a share a week and then buy it, minimum investment of Â£500.

I'll go through your questions anyway:

1. I don't need access to the funds and can afford for them to lose money (but not more than 15%). 
2. I'm happy with a moderate amount of risk when investing.

The September thing was just a statement, justification for me not buying more shares this year more than anything else. I don't really have the time to track them to such a high degree as I usually would, that's the main reasoning - I can't be as quick off the ball and I'm less willing to do any day trading.

All my stock choices are supported by blogs, strategies or recommendations/friends or in some cases a deep knowledge of the industry. I think when you say ""amateur stock picking isn't going to beat the stock market"" that's on par with me saying it is - there are no guarantees (except the few I listed previously). Keep in mind all the FTSE is, is a group of the top 100 largest companies and their combined change, for every share that does poorly there's another which does well to influence the change - beating the stock market means you need a share in the latter category (consistently) and some shares we know a lot about, for example if we can observe that oxford instruments have had a factory destroyed in russia, it's likely their percentage will drop as investors consider the impact it will have on their annual profit (this is day traders kicking in). We also know that they'll rebuild it within a year, thus after they take the hit (which they did) it becomes a good profit because this time next year their profits will return (long term traders kicking in), so the drop of 15% (whatever it was) means in 12 months time they could be back up by 15%. A bit of investigation and intelligence is always useful, but if you know a lot about a company it helps with predictions at least (these are just predictions though) help with knowing what's going to do well/bad. Royal mails another good example, lots of investors said it was hugely undervalued, so what happens when it hits the stock market - people buy in and it continually goes up for weeks, people make money off the back. Have a google of dogs of the FTSE, that's basically a small portfolio which continually beats the FTSE by selecting shares based on yield, I'm no different just my selection is based on little bits of knowledge about the companies (the dogs has been beating the FTSE for 14 years and in 2009 made 86.5% return).

Perhaps I've got confused by some language here and I've been using index and funds back and forward, my apologies.

Your final point again is related to why I'm getting cash ISA's or current accounts rather than an index/fund or self selected shares, the cash ISA and current account guarantees profit (it wasn't related to shares).",null,0,null,1423821936,null,0,false,0,cok628j,null,t3_2vj1cz,null,t1_cok628j,null,t1_cojqc3d,null,null,null,1424564939,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

This is especially true when it comes to the biggest contractor in the UK, Balfour Beatty (BB). An example of the kind of thing I'm talking about is that the sub-contractor I currently work for who works for BB finished their contract at the end of June 2014, BB were supposed to have sent the new contract before the end of the old one as we work as a framework contractor, meaning that we continually work for them year on year on year but require a fresh contract every year. BB only sent the new contract AFTER the old contract ended. Obviously we wanted some time to read and sign the new contract but they placed us under economic duress and told us that if we didn't sign it within the day of it being sent, we would not be paid for the works undertaken in the previous contract which is utter bullshit and totally incorrect. Working as a consultant for the sub-contractor, the company that I work for and I both advised our client not to sign the contract because what they're saying is 100% untrue. Our client did not listen and signed the contract anyway because if he didn't get paid, the health of his business missing that one payment would be severely damaged. This is the kind of bully boy tactics that major contractors use and always have done, to my knowledge.

It depends on your priorities. Getting that employer match is a definite one (also make sure you're getting your full tax back, check the amounts that go out and the amount that gets reclaimed in your pension, you may be able to claim back some tax :) ). After that, it's still an excellent way of saving long term. You put the money in before tax, then when you withdraw you get 25% tax free and the rest is taxed as income. Assuming it's your only income and you take out Â£20k a year, that reduces the tax you're paying from 40% to 7.5% (paying 20% on 75% of the amount over Â£10k). At 30k that's still only 10%. At worst, if you don't go into the 40% tax bracket and have another source of income using your personal allowance it's still a max of 15% tax.

*However* there are restrictions on withdrawing, limitations on age of withdrawal, etc. There are also limits on the total value you can build up (~1.25M I think currently) and legislation may change in the future. 

There are tradeoffs, but it's certainly worth looking into. The upsides are quite inviting, if the downsides don't matter too much to you.

If we knew HSBC were doing these activities we would not have been happy to a customer, or at least we would have wanted a lower price. At the moment, we do not know what companies do, so the price of morality is not incorporated into the market price (could think of it like a negative externality to production). The signal we can use today is binary: 0 boycott a company; 1 accept trade with a company. If businesses signalled their moral attributes we could start paying the right price. All we need is a signal to base our judgement on. Even if there was a simple traffic light system indicating, for example, whether a company pays a living wage; Eco; where does it pay tax; what do they do for the local community. Then in everyday life it would be simple to adjust where you spend you money; between the cafe that pays a living wage or the one who's got a slave
working there? The signal is incorporated into the market. My premise is that boycotts rarely work, we should embrace the bit between the 0s and 1s. If we can apply pressure with our consumer power (with the help of an improved signal) a real market for morality might develop. This market will at least represent a tool in which we can express our moral values, if our actions effect profits there will be an incentive to change behaviour of companies.

I actually think it's best not even to consider whether it was a war crime.  Because it's not a question that can ever be truly answered, and the answer would not really do us any good either way.

It happened.  That is the truth, and that is what the world needs to acknowledge. Many awful, regrettable, dreadful atrocities happened during World War II (and the Great War). 

What we need to do is ensure they don't happen again. Preventing the kind of chain of events that led to a situation where Dresden was bombed, if that makes sense.

But here we must do something unusual for reddit. We must pay close attention to detail. 

Consider the following two scenarios and tell me whether you see any important moral difference between them and in which way you would prefer to be treated. Pay attention now. 

Here is the first scenario. I am a Muslim. I inform you that me and the brothers have had a talk and we've decided, since folk like you, unbelievers or kafar as we call you, are in the minority in this institution, we think you really should accept the rule that no pork is to be eaten here. We find it absolutely disgusting and can't bear the thought of swine being brought in and possible contaminating our sanctified halal products. If even a single spatter were to get into our food it would be ruined. We might even go down to six virgins after death. In an effort to appear reasonable I tell you that we also agreed that if the majority of our assembly were Hindus we would be perfectly willing to accept the principle that we shouldn't offend them by eating beef, since we know the cow is sacred to them (not sure of the accuracy of this detail but no matter). Therefore we have decided that you really should accept this stricture whether you like it or not. 

Here is the second scenario. I explain to you that I'm a Muslim and me and the brothers really find this pork meat of the filthy swine disgusting and it's against our religion. You have no idea, I explain, how much we would appreciate it if you would be so kind as to do us a favour. Please, please, pretty please do not bring pork products into this institution and accept the general rule that all food here will be lacking in pork of any sort, and in fact will be halal (this should have been in the other scenario too), if you don't mind. In fact, we are willing to negotiate this and may be prepared to do some favour in return. We accept your right to reject this proposal, but ask kindly that you give it some serious thought because it concerns us so very much, and let us know what, if anything, you would like us to do in return, so that we can negotiate out of a motive of desire for mutual cooperation and understanding. 

Can you see any important moral difference?

I would argue there is a subtle but important difference between ""you should"" and ""we would like you to"". The first is imposing a moral constraint on others, in my example and in the real life case, on the basis of the principle of majority rule, a principle that we do not dream of applying to the tiny minority of Muslims in the country as a whole. We let them practise as individuals whatever religion they please and dress as they please as long as they cause no harm. At least i hope we do. 

The second, on the other hand, negotiates. There is no imposition of religious principle. There is an acknowledgement of freedom of choice and a request for discussion and agreement so that both parties can be accommodated. 

The difference is huge, black and white, and not slippery. 

Reflect on it. One day they'll come for you perhaps. 

Also, be honest. Just how good is the smell of streaky bacon frying up on a Saturday morning? How tasty is that crisp filler in a sandwich with a bit of lettuce and tomato on fresh bread. Mayonnaise perhaps? Or with beautiful fresh fried egg and tomato with toast and tea. Orange juice, chilled, thrown in. It's just not the same without that sharp bacon taste. 

This is our culture. Accommodate others by all means. But make sure you know it is something that matters to you too. It is your food culture, your established taste and your choice. 

Nature has endowed you with that choice. What right does anyone have to take it from you? You can freely enter into a contract but no one has a right to impose it on you. This may sound grand, but the principle is fundamental and the right to freedom of choice is inalienable. 

I can assure you, you don't want your freedom of choice taken from you in this way. If you don't know that, you just haven't thought about it enough yet. I can spare you the trouble. Believe me. You don't. No one does, including Muslims. That's why we would never dream of imposing our religion on them, not even our lack of religion. At least I hope we wouldn't, because we can't live in peace together under any other principle but freedom. 

Why couldn't this matter have been openly discussed at these schools so that a sensible agreement was reached that satisfied everyone, including and especially the minority, whose rights we respect in all other cases?

Go and find the party that you think best represents your interests. It doesn't matter if you think they have no hope of winning, you need to send a message. Politicians in the main parties don't expect you to vote, so their policies are not going to be geared towards you. 

If they see that there is a significant number of young people prepared to exercise their vote then they will be more likely to tailor future policies towards you. Also it looks as though the next election will return a hung parliament, and there might not even be the possibility of a two party coalition being able to form a majority.

Leaving ~ which is a more extreme version of the above. Myself I see no options therefore I've spent the last 5 years preparing to leave for elsewhere.

By criticising tax avoidance â an entirely legal activity â Ed Miliband has opened up some of his own colleagues and donors to questions about their own tax affairs.

They include donor John Mills, who gave Â£1.65m to Labour in shares two years ago because it was the âmost tax-efficient way of doing thisâ. The Labour leader may also see renewed scrutiny of the arrangements set up around the Miliband family home after the death of his father.

âDavid Cameron has to explain why he appointed a treasurer of the Conservative party who boasts about tax avoidance and thinks itâs something everyone does,â Mr Miliband said on Thursday, referring to Lord Fink, the former Conservative treasurer and hedge fund chief.

Lord Fink had claimed that tax avoidance was something that âeveryone didâ: after all the phrase covers some innocuous activities such as putting savings into an ISA.

During his visit to a north London school Mr Miliband was questioned about the arrangement used by his own family on a townhouse in north London.

After Ralph Miliband died in 1994 his assets transferred to his wife, Marion. Soon afterwards his will was changed via a so-called âdeed of variationâ to give 20 per cent of the family home to each of his two sons, David and Ed.

The property was sold in 2004 to David Miliband: there was no liability for inheritance tax because his mother was still alive.

Had she died before that sale the arrangement from a decade earlier would have minimised the familyâs tax liabilities. That is because each individual has a tax-free threshold on which no inheritance tax is paid, currently set at Â£325,000. By sharing a property between several people a family can diminish the tax owed.

âThe reason people use deeds of variation is to save inheritance tax,â according to John Whiting, former head of tax at PwC.

On Thursday, the Labour leader said: âI paid tax on that transaction,â when asked about the deal. But he was referring to the 40 per cent capital gains tax he paid on the profits. âIt canât be tax avoidance if no tax was avoided,â said a spokesman.

Mr Miliband can also expect fresh scrutiny of the tax affairs of other Labour MPs, donors and associates.

Past major donors to the party include several with ânon-domicileâ status in Britain, meaning that they did not pay UK income tax or capital gains tax on international earnings.
These included Lakshmi Mittal, Sir Ronald Cohen and Lord Paul.

Andrew Rosenfeld, who died last weekend, gave nearly Â£1m to the Labour party and was based in Switzerland for five years after the sale of his stake in Minerva, a property company. Mr Rosenfeld never denied that he had moved to the low-tax Alpine country for tax reasons.

Labour has also received Â£20,000 last August from Vitabiotics, a vitamins company owned by a holding group based in the British Virgin Islands.

At the same time, the party has received more than Â£500,000 of âdonationsâ â in the form of consultancy advice â from PwC. The public accounts committee, chaired by Labour MP Margaret Hodge, has accused PwC of âselling tax avoidance on an industrial scaleâ.

After Mr Mills donated the shares in his company JML Limited he said he had been advised to do so. âIt is the most tax-efficient way of doing this because, otherwise, you get no tax relief on donations to political parties,â he said.",null,0,null,1423825647,null,0,false,0,cok6sei,null,t3_2vr7sj,null,t1_cok6sei,null,t3_2vr7sj,null,null,null,1424565278,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

I have a Lancome cleanser, which is like a milky cream type; a Simple Sensitive Skin foaming face wash; a Simple Sensitive Skin face scrub; a Lancome toner; then various beauty serums and moisturisers. 

My routine at the moment is to use the foaming face wash, then just the serums and moisturier (currently both are l'occitan but I have a number for test pots, so this will change to Lancome serum and moisturiser in a few weeks) and a lip balm (Nivea Hydrocare) daily. I also use the face scrub every 2 days in the shower for exfoliating. I reapply lip balm throughout the day if my lips feel dry, if I'm going outside, or if I'm going to be in the car with heating/ac on.

I feel like I should be using the cleansers and toners, but I don't know when or in what order. 

My skin is generally clear, but with small blackheads, and my nose area gets greasy. I get the occasional spot (~once a week to once a fortnight), but I don't have dry skin problems.

  The first one is a Whetherspoon's, which is awful. I'm not that bad with Spoon's really, but this one is just full very old folk farting and dying in silence. 
  
  The second one is a bit like a slightly more upmarket Wetherspoon's that thinks it's a wine bar, despite the only wine being so is probably being to me, or to 16 year old's who think 'RosÃ© is rite classy innit'. The food is all microwaved, the clientele is exclusively under 25s getting mashed before they go out in Croydon (they do a roaring trade in lurid shots) and the bar is too tall. That I can't deal with. I'm a tallish man, I expect that even if I wanted to drink in there, I should be able to stand at the bar, lean my elbow on it and chat shit to someone. Not so, here I feel like a midget in a man's world. It's unsettling.  
 
  Finally, the last pub. It's rough, has carpet in it that's so dirty and stiff that I suspect that it actually supports the walls and has a nice U-shaped bar that runs through the center of it. All the people that don't fit into the farting and dying, or the coked up want-to-get-laid lot end up in here. It's a pretty disparate, motley group of grumpy people listening to the below-average garage band that's squeezed under the dartboard and perform for a bar-tab, a couple of fruit-machines that have half the buttons permanently punched in where the skinheads hang out being racist. It's a proper pub, but nothing really happens there.

From a moral perspective, it's broadly whether you're taking the piss or not.

Amazon claim they make no sales in the UK, thus earn no money here nor owe any tax - that's taking the piss. As is Starbucks adjusting the internal price that one division sells product to another for, in order to shuffle money around the company to divisions in low-tax countries.

Someone taking money as a dividend rather than salary is still paying tax, and presumably their NI (and the Ltd company is making employers NI contributions), so they're still making a reasonable contribution even if they're not paying quite as much as they otherwise might.

Sorry my friend, but unless you do literally nothing else with your life but work then you have time. Volunteering doesn't require the commitment that an internships does and may only be an hour a week. 

You can volunteer as a pen friend for an old person or someone on death row and write one letter a month. You can act as a telephone befriender for someone who is blind and have one phone call a week. You can help in all manner of ways which don't have to take up any great proportion of your time.

Pretty sure that is actually just evasion - you are declaring for tax purposes that you are doing one thing, and then doing another. You might as well fudge your company accounts to show that you have made no profit in a year and pocket the rest tax-free. You're *lying* to HMRC.

That's different to selecting the most tax-efficient option from the selection of legal business structures available to you.

&gt; Buying a nearly-new car instead of a brand new one.

Buying second-hand goods is neither tax avoidance nor evasion. The original buyer bought the car and paid tax on it. Sure, you won't pay any *more* VAT on it, but how much they are willing to sell it for will be based on the total sum they bought it for, not the manufacturer's ex.VAT price.

&gt; Buying your cigarettes/alchohol while you are on holiday abroad.

That would be evasion if you exceed your personal allowance.

They are not an illuminati or a cartel they are simply a group of people who have disproportionate level of economic power and who have interests that inevitably often but not always align. 

They aren't organised, they aren't in one big club and there isn't one big meeting. They do sometimes cooperate when it is beneficial to their self interest.  

They also have disproportionate political influence because they own the mass media which in turn directly controls the information that is presented to the public and controls the opinions of large numbers the population. 

They also have disproportionate political power because the political parties rely on them for donation money. This results in direct influence on our politicians. 

Now you are correct they are individuals operating in their own self interest and not an organised group. So some of these economic elite use the media they own to create a media narrative that is beneficial to them over the rest of the population (which has the result of manipulating public opinion). 

Some donate to political parties and then use that influence to push for legislation that benefits them over the rest of the population. 

This is done on an individual and disorganised fashion. The result however is a society rigged in their favour. Just the same as if it were an organised conspiracy.

And if we stumble once in the EL then we miss out.

I actually agree about the experience, but not for our first team. Our first team has already had experience in the CL this season (and EL in the past), which is more valuable than the experiences they'll have in the EL. Many of our second-stringers and newer players haven't had European experience though which is why the EL will be valuable for them. 

Like I said, if a squad comprised mainly of our depth players can get us to the later stages of the EL, then by all means bring in the big guns, but I don't believe it's worth wasting effort over in these earlier stages when the prospect of winning it is so much less likely than grabbing a 4th position spot.

It's understandable that people want us to compete on all fronts, but I don't think the reality of our current situation will bear fruit in that regard.

This really cannot be emphasised enough. Particularly in marginals all the parties are trying to get as much information about who could possibly be convinced to vote for them as humanly (and increasingly non-humanly) possible. However, if you don't vote, and don't vote repeatedly, and are extremely sluggish in updating the electoral roll, you will essentially be written off.

Not voting for one election is fine, especially in safer seats. And those people who do occasionally not vote due to their tending to be more swing voters will most definitely be targeted. Again though *only if they do actually vote sometimes*.

So I really do encourage, like the two posts above this one: if you're young, vote. Even if its just the Greens and have no chance of actually getting it.

The trouble is that a lot of these people that have these strong anti theist opinions often seem to attack people based on their faith, or use a few examples to generalise a religion of over a billion people, (which is essentially what bigotry is), which is why they get called up on it.

Tax avoidance isn't a definable thing beyond ""setting up your affairs to avoid paying more than is absolutely necessary"". For many people this means paying 15% overall rather than 20%, or 35% rather than 40%.

If you take the piss it means you reduce it to 3% or something.


Multi-nationals genuinely do shuffle ""wooden dollars"" between business divisions when they sell product internally.
Likewise, shareholders in a company are not always employees - and draw money out as dividend.

There is no sensible way to stop a company fixing it's internal prices so that all the profit is made by divisions in low-tax countries, nor to stop a small business owner taking all their income as dividends rather than salary.

It very much does come down to shaming them into saying ""Okay, we could take the piss and structure our taxes like that, but we're going to do our corporate citizenship and structure it like this, even if it means we arguably pay a few percent less than is proper.

null,false,Samson_Strange,,Noisy and spills things.,null,"&gt;Friday plans for you lot?  
  
  Not getting out early, which is a pity.  
  
  Picked up Evolve (as you know) yesterday and plan on playing a bit of it tonight if the missus doesn't mind. Probably have a glass of wine will doing that after I've prepped a lasagne. I don't know why, but I feel like having a cheese binge.  
  
  Anyway, onto Evolve.   
  
  Reddit and the internet *hate it*, it's been launched with a load of Day 1 DLC that, if you bought the lot, will double the price of the game. Only... they're all texture packs. Slightly different gun shade, character skins, etc. While I lament about the days that you used to be able to buy a game, and that was it, this isn't really all that gamechanging. It's so gloomy most of the time that having a grey, dark blue or black gun doesn't matter a fuckload anyway, but I guess it would be nice if these sorts of things were unlockable rather than paid for. Either way, they make no difference to gameplay.  
 
  As for the actual game, well... *it's not worth the money I paid for it* which is the sticking point for me. It's a 4vs1 always-on deathmatch, squad of 4 people, taking on a single player who controls a boss type creature, no other real PvE stuff apart from seriously low level creatures that don't really chase you. Premise: as a team of hunters, hunt the 'monster', as the 'monster' smash the team that's chasing you flat.   
  
  It's unique, novel, and kind of fun, but it's not very new, nor is it challenging. The Hunters weapons all lock-on with auto-aim which tracks from a ridiculous distance, which removes the fun of aiming from far away, and the Monster is locked to 3rd person play. While you can have fun running away from the team and then power up and trying to smash them all in the Gary when you're super powerful, you don't really get that much of a chance to do so; the hunters spawn very shortly after you, and very close to you, the movement feels a bit clunky and all in all, even when you're challenged it just feels a bit clunky, and the controls janky.   
  
  That's the gameplay wrapped up, the visuals. Yeah, they're nice if you like dimly lit forests with a couple of bit rocks in them, and some sort of vaguely futuristic machine bits scattered about the map. Of which there are 12. I played on maybe 3 or 4 of them, and by and large they look similar enough for me to not be sure if I played one or two of them twice, or if I played 5 different ones. The sounds are nice, quite bass-y and loud.   
  
  Difficulty; negligible - it's a bit of a point and click holdy-handy snorefest with all the fun of gunplay ruined by overgenerous auto-aim and boring weapon set. I suppose there's some challenge to it, but it all feels a bit whitewashed.   
  
 Longevity; probably not long at all. Support for new maps and stuff will apparently be free, and they'll be adding more Hunter and Monster models paid for, but by that point I'll probably have shelved it for good. I'd be surprised if I play it at all after tonight.     
  
  I recorded the first game I played and uploaded it to youtube here, but it's pretty shit and quite boring.

I actually do want immigration controlled somewhat (not to the extent that Australia goes, but maybe meeting them halfway?). I agree with you on most points but i think our immigration policy is a bit too lax regarding the EU and that's one downside to being in it. I don't want limits on specific countries/peoples but just tighter regulations such as the person being fit enough to work, can read and write etc. I don't know if the current policy includes that or not. What do you think?

And regarding the ""my kind of Muslim"" line, i find the newer generation even more relaxed than we are. We don't eat non halal but some of us (not me and my circle) drink alcohol. Everyone has girlfriends/boyfriends even though it's frowned upon in both Asian and Muslim circles. The young'ns are mixing well with the white population imo and we're getting a much more diluted Islam because of it. There are hardcore fundamentalists out there but the ones i've come across are totally harmless in the sense that they won't actively go out and bomb/kill people to put their views across, but they sour the mood all too often with their shit attitude (e.g someone tries to liven the atmosphere by turning on the music and the fundies just put a moody face on and claim it's haraam as fuck). Actually, the 2 i've met probably don't even read the 5 namaz (daily prayers) which is supposed to be 1 of the most important pillars of islam, yet they think they have the authority and knowledge to dispute shit like stunned and unstunned halal meat. Shit's mind boggling. You've probably heard the term ""Wahaabi"", which is what these guys are. You'll probably be glad to hear many of us are told while growing up to not attend certain mosques because they're ""Wahaabi mosques"" (although i personally feel that there's nothing wrong with praying there but listening and adhering to their principles is against my own, but that does not affect my personal prayers in that building).

So people are expected to know what food they buy from a fucking supermarket is produced by actual slaves or not?? We have organic stickers already. Personally I think stickers letting me know what has or hasn't been produced by slave labour is more important.

And who writes the tax laws? Why aren't they a one size fits all? Why is tax a percentage of profits rather than sales for example? 

Here's how you pay tax if you're a big multi national in the UK. 

1. Sell lots and lots of goods like starbucks or amazon 

2. At the end of the financial year spend all your profits on stockpiling goods so your company runs at a loss for ""that financial year""

3. Pay zero or negative tax for your ""struggling company"" whilst sinking local business who can't bulk buy goods to run at a loss

4.  profit

Capitalism (specifically it's more nefarious revival neoliberal-capitalism by Thatcher/Reagan in the 80s) is a bankrupt economic ideology that has turned the west into prostitutes with wages that have declined year on year since the 1970's. At least with the cold war and the threat of the left-far left protesting in support of socialism/communism the corporate entities would pay a percentage of tax (40 percent even in the US/UK) in the 50s that would today be called communism by the centre and centre-right. 

But with the fall of the soviet union and the successful rebranding of socialist/communism ideas to totalitarianism corporates entities can now happily get away with paying 0.001 percent tax. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19967397",null,0,null,1423830735,null,0,1423838450,0,cok7x0g,null,t3_2vr7sj,null,t1_cok7x0g,null,t3_2vr7sj,null,null,null,1424565865,null,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27,null

You need only look to somewhere like America where the head of state is elected regularly to see that it causes huge schisms, to the point where people refuse to recognise a president as their leader. Queen Elizabeth has an approval rate at 90% and is currently the most admired person in the UK, something unmatched by any politician.

It also counters inequality. By saddling the wealthy with noblesse oblige you ensure they use their wealth responsibly. Looking to America again, a nation without monarchy begins to take on the characteristics of an oligarchy. Tax evasion, unfair business principles and wealth hoarding take root; they've taken root in the UK in the wake of Americanisation. If it sounds like lunacy that a system designed to formalise inequality would counter inequality then consider that of the top twenty nations for inequality adjusted HDI, over half are monarchies.

Moreover, the monarchy is an enormous part of Britain's image abroad and an integral part of the UK. The historical struggle between parliament and crown has led to a messy system of checks and balances which have evolved into odd little traditions. To dethrone the monarch would result in wiping the slate clean and effectively removing what myself and many others consider to be the best of the UK. 

There are dozens of reasons to support or oppose the monarchy. Whichever side you take depends on your values, and that isn't something that will change if I continue pontificating.

Reed is a central midfielder who came through our Academy, and has recently (14-15 season) started to feature in the first team. He plays in a role that can be defined best as a Ball Winning Midfielder. He is very good at high tempo pressing, from midfield and in front of the defence but also near the opposition's back line. He causes trouble for opposition players by limiting the time they have on the ball. Tackles, interceptions, and blocks, Reed is always there. Not the man mountain as is sometimes usual for CDMs, but no doubt a player with a lot of potential to grow into the team, and can have a definite role to play.  

His stamina is impressive, chasing down players for 90 minutes in his first start, and could lead to him filling a similar role to Schneiderlin in the long term - a Box-to-Box midfielder adept at both defence and attack.

&gt;The __Danegeld__ (/ËdeÉªn.É¡Éld/;  ""Danish tax"", literally ""Dane tribute"") was a [tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax) raised to pay [tribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute) to the [Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking) raiders to save a land from being ravaged. It was called the *geld* or *gafol* in eleventh-century sources;  the term *Danegeld* did not appear until the early twelfth century.  It was characteristic of royal policy in both [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) and [Francia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francia) during the ninth through eleventh centuries, collected both as [tributary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute), to buy off the attackers, and as [stipendiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipend), to pay the defensive forces.

Did *you* even read the article, man? Wanting to ""develop to be at the level to go into a top team"" is very different from wanting to ""arrive at a top club again"". In a season where his new club 1) spent the most ever to sign him, 2) is currently struggling to get points, and 3) needs more production out of him, the least thing they likely want to hear from him right now is how he wants to get good enough so he can eventually leave.

I know that there's a fair amount of Lukaku hate around here, but this is exactly why. He talks and talks in the media, when he hasn't yet earned the price tags that have been shelled out for him. I would've loved for him to stick around here and work to get better, earn more PT, and eventually start. But he wasn't willing to do that. So whatever, I wished him well and thanked Everton for the cash.

I'd be rather annoyed by those comments were I an Everton fan, though.

To deny someone the opportunity all his life to enjoy the freedoms of this country, simply because of an accident of birth, is cruel and unjust. The onus should always be on the government to explain and justify why two people should not enter into an employment contract simply because of where one of them was born, a matter of no obvious relavence. Capital and goods move freely across borders. Why not labour?

&gt; And regarding the ""my kind of Muslim"" line, i find the newer generation even more relaxed than we are. We don't eat non halal but some of us (not me and my circle) drink alcohol. 

Fantastic. I love that. And it's interesting that the second generation becomes almost rejecting of the parental traditionalism, but then the third comes along and tries to rediscover its roots. But you can see, even in the space of a few years, former bigots mellowing in the face of our welcoming, non-racist openness and it's really nice to see some relative newcomers appreciating us for that.

&gt; Everyone has girlfriends/boyfriends even though it's frowned upon in both Asian and Muslim circles. 

Indeed. Religious stricture and hypocrisy have always been good bedfellows.

&gt; The young'ns are mixing well with the white population imo and we're getting a much more diluted Islam because of it. 

Ah. You sound rueful. I can understand that. But it's life. 

&gt; There are hardcore fundamentalists out there but the ones i've come across are totally harmless in the sense that they won't actively go out and bomb/kill people to put their views across, but they sour the mood all too often with their shit attitude (e.g someone tries to liven the atmosphere by turning on the music and the fundies just put a moody face on and claim it's haraam as fuck). 

Yes. And have you noticed? How many fundies does it take to ruin a party? One.

&gt; Actually, the 2 i've met probably don't even read the 5 namaz (daily prayers) which is supposed to be 1 of the most important pillars of islam, yet they think they have the authority and knowledge to dispute shit like stunned and unstunned halal meat.

Exactly. This is the difference between being devout and being bigoted. The devout and pious actually embody in their lives the real essence and meaning of their religion. The bigots just apply the rules like empty vesels of superiority and smugness.

&gt; Shit's mind boggling. You've probably heard the term ""Wahaabi"", which is what these guys are. You'll probably be glad to hear many of us are told while growing up to not attend certain mosques because they're ""Wahaabi mosques"" (although i personally feel that there's nothing wrong with praying there but listening and adhering to their principles is against my own, but that does not affect my personal prayers in that building). It'll take some time, but we'll get there, and the country will be much better off.

I have heard the term Wahaabi. I think we have some at the end of the road. They dress  exclusively in white. Are those the ones?

Anyway, I always get it mixed up with Wasabi. Watch out for that stuff. It's as hot as hell. lol

Common tax avoidance are ISAs or having a competent lawyer to draft a will or assist with the probate/administration. Both of these have different aims, one is to provide a bank account with a higher rate or interest and to ensure you have committed your due diligence. 

I agree with Tax Avoidance practices if these practices are to clarify your accounts and to not pay any more than you have to pay.

No college can really be said to be better or worse for certain subjects. Some colleges won't take students from particular subjects, but those will be smaller subjects like History of Art or Linguistics. I'm pretty sure every college will take Physics students.

Very little if any teaching is actually done within college, it is done at a university level, that's why college doesn't make a difference as far as study goes.

Also, there are no colleges who can consistently be said to have easier interviews. If there were, everyone would apply there! Additionally, Cambridge has an elaborate 'pooling' system, which means if the college you apply to likes you but doesn't have enough places to take you, they'll give you a score out of ten, and put you in the 'pool'. Other colleges with places spare look at the applicants in the pool and choose the ones they'd like.

Choosing a college is much more of a personal choice. You should consider questions like:

* Do you prefer a smaller or larger community?
* Old college or new college?
* Central or Outskirts?

If it is realistic for you to visit, I would strongly encourage it. Visit as many colleges as you can, and get a feel for them. Many people choose their college on a total whim, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that :)

Good luck applying!

That's right. 

In some constituencies, the only way to stop, say, UKIP getting in, will be for those who would normally vote for another party to all agree to vote for the least bad next option. 

The reason UKIP is divisive is that they ""steal"" votes from most other parties, meaning you could end up with something like:

UKIP: 29% of the vote

TORY: 21% of the vote

LAB: 13% of the vote

LIB: 6% of the vote

OTH: 1% of the vote.

The way to stop UKIP is for LAB/LIB/OTH supporters to vote Tory.

There will be other places where Labour or Liberal are the best vote.

These sort of situations won't be isolated in this election: they will be everywhere.

It may be that record is lost or requires further recall from an archive for example or perhaps they didn't even recieve it. E-mail gets lost all the time, as a protocol it's a terrible way to send important information as it's simply not designed for secure and validated message delivery.

The question is, if they had recieved the e-mail, what would be a barrier to them acting on this information?

As I say, the guy didn't drop information on their doorstep, he essentially sent an invitation for HMRC to collude with him in retrieving information potentially illlegally.

If that would be a barrier, then we can understand why the record is gone. Perhaps it was looked at and disregarded because they felt they could not act on the e-mail legally.

""Cooperation"" is perfectly fine, but the problem with the first two years of coalition he was so fond of was the complete *lack* of perceived differentiation between the two parties. The party dug its own grave in those years- the strategy pursued since has been a simple matter of damage control.

It's no bloody good going into coalition if you aren't prepared to make a public stand on red lines, nor is it going to do much in the long term if the sum total of Liberal Democrat contributions to government policy in the next fifty years end up being a minor improvement in one single mediocre government. 

In order to be a ""radical Liberal"" party, the Liberal Democrat party first has to *exist* in a form that allows it to wield any influence. If Browne had his way, we'd be looking at absolute armageddon, rather than the heavy drubbing we're about to get.

His projection that we could come out of this year with 30 seats drives home the magnitude of his delusion.

&gt;&gt;Seven trophies. Lost out on five. Unpopular manager. The season couldn't have been worse. But there is still a lot to be achieved. We won two trophies last season and we can do it again. No matter how tough the journey gets, we will always be right behind the team because we still are Champions of Europe.

 - Tax avoidance is arranging your affairs, within full bounds of the law, to minimise your tax liability.  e.g. Making use of an ISA or pension, or married couple's allowance, or whatever.  You would happily tell the tax man about these arrangements, since they are legal.

 - Tax _evasion_ is arranging your affairs secretively so as to hide assets or earnings.  Evasion is illegal, and you wouldn't want the tax man to find out about them because you would be liable for the tax.

Those definitions have been in place for hundreds of years.  So no there are not ""two ways to 'avoid' tax"", one illegal, since avoidance is, by definition, legal.

White flight? From wiki:

""A 2005 report stated that white migration within the UK is mainly from areas of high ethnic minority population to those with predominantly white populations. White British families have moved out of London as many immigrants have settled in the capital. The report's writers expressed concern about British social cohesion and stated that different ethnic groups were living ""parallel lives""; they were concerned that lack of contact between the groups could result in fear more readily exploited by extremists. The London School of Economics in a study found similar results.""

I'm sure it's not as simple as all white British people that leave areas with lots of immigrants or ethnic minorities doing it purely because they don't like the diversity, but it's definitely a factor. Immigration is one of the biggest issues to voters of all backgrounds and roughly three quarters of people want it slowed down or stopped altogether.

&gt;Tax avoidance is arranging your affairs, within full bounds of the law, to minimise your tax liability. e.g. Making use of an ISA or pension, or married couple's allowance, or whatever. You would happily tell the tax man about these arrangements, since they are legal.

&gt;&gt;one of them is working within the bounds of law.

&gt;Tax evasion is arranging your affairs secretively so as to hide assets or earnings. Evasion is illegal, and you wouldn't want the tax man to find out about them because you would be liable for the tax.

With proper regulation, fraccing is fine with groundwater contamination in America caused by cowboy fraccers. Seismic activity is caused by water flooding not the fraccing process, most offshore wells (north Sea) are fracced and you don't here about many tsunamis hitting  east anglia.  Without a serious breakthrough in energy storage technology the effectiveness of renewables as anything more than a supplement to main energy production is limited due to inconsistency. So without a large investment in nuclear (my preferential option) or an increase in energy efficiency; fossil fuel dependence will stay the same or increase making fraccing favourable. 

TL:DR 
Current renewables are too inconsistent and we don't have a very good method of storing energy 
People are stupid and hate nuclear.

There are parties that are, arguably ofcourse, more or less ethical than others. It's a continuum.  You may never have the absolute pure bastion of morality to vote for, but you can still vote for the better options, and if they get more votes, they *will* come in to power.

The 8th doctor got his first season Jan-Apr 2001. It was the best selling run that Big Finish had had, because it was the first canon stories for the 8th doctor (despite critic reviews being mixed). Because of the sales figures, his second season ran for 6 stories instead of 4 throughout the first half of 2002. This is regarded by fans as one of the high water marks for Big Finish as a company, most of the second season is incredibly strong and got very good critical reviews.

Season 3 kicked off with a bizarre, 3 1/2 hour 40th anniversary premiere that was as ambitious as it was weird. It was also a year and a half between seasons 2 and 3, so possibly the whole thing had been overthought. The season ran for 5 stories  in late 2003 and early 2004. Season 4 followed in late 2004 for 4 stories, and season 5 ran in late 2005 into 2006 for 6 episodes.

At this point, Big Finish were aware that the 8th doctor was their biggest hit, but also that Doctor Who was back on tv, they didn't have the rights to the new doctors, and the traditional doctor who story format was changed to 45 minute stories rather than 2 hour stories split into 30 minute segments. So they did a sort of restart. The stories were all 45 minutes (and priced cheaper, as they were shorter). The seasons were longer (12-13 stories), and the range was rebranded 'The New Adventures of the Eighth Doctor'. So what could have been 'season 6' was actually rebranded 'season one' of 'the new adventures' to encourage new fans of the TV show to start here, because many people wouldn't start listening at season 6. It is this range that is on sale, and you don't need to know anything that happened in the previous seasons because they really did launch it with the intention of being a starting point for new listeners.

There have been 4 seasons in this new format, all are on sale. After all that, they recently came out with an ambitious box set called 'Dark Eyes'  which is one story, but season length. This was such a big hit, that Dark Eyes 2 and 3 were later released, with 4 forthcoming.

We are concerned for her welfare because of her age and vulnerability. 

She went missing in her school uniform, a green sweatshirt with school logo, a green polo shirt underneath, black trousers and black shoes. She had a small black handbag with white trim.

null,false,uklegalbeagle,uk,London,null,"I don't mind a frank debate of views but if you are going to argue against capitalism at least understand how it works. Your explanation of how a multi-national pays tax is laughable.

When creating a profit and loss account for a given year, the cost of purchases for the purpose of resale doesn't go into the accounts until the goods are sold. So, say for 2014, I buy 100,000 Â£1 widgets and I sell half for Â£2, my accounts will show:

Revenue - Â£100,000 (50,000 widgets at Â£2 each)
Cost of sale - Â£50,000
Gross profit - Â£50,000

I then deduct my administration costs giving a net profit figure on which I'm taxed. I can't deduct the cost of the remaining 50,000 widgets to make a loss.  The goods sit in the balance sheet as an asset. Now, I can dump costs in to the line under gross profit but they are sunk costs and generally speaking are not directly attributable to your sales so spending Â£50,000 on a big Xmas party may reduce my tax bill to zero but it will damage the balance sheet and hit cashflow.

And that's why tax is based on profit not sales. If I run a business operating at a net profit margin of 6% i.e. I make Â£6000 on sales of Â£100,000 after all costs are taken out, I'd be paying over Â£20,000 in corporation tax if based on revenue. Some businesses are naturally low margin but the high volume means they generate high cash profits which would be eliminated by a tax on revenue unless the tax rate dropped.

If you actually want to know how Amazon and Starbucks pay less tax, I suggest you look at transfer pricing between intra-group companies and the royalty costs for using the brand names.  Starbucks don't avoid tax by buying a million fucking tonnes of coffee on 31 December each year.

That's... nothing like what you implied in your previous comment.

The subject was not ""being a bit of an arsehole"" - it was *touching up kids*.

When you said

&gt;&gt;&gt; Absolutely everyone knew. I was warned about Rolf Harris by his own *brother* before I met him.

... the implications was that Harris' brother had warned you he was fiddly and liable to try to sexually assault you.

Then in the subsequent comment it turns out that no, he *actually* only warned you that Harris was a short-tempered arsehole.

Unless you're seriously suggesting that ""being a foul-mouthed arsehole"" is the same thing as ""fucking small children"" your earlier comment makes no sense at all.

Also, *plenty* of people heard rumours about these entertainers before now, but they had a lot of influence with the authorities and nobody had any *proof* they were abusers.

It only becomes a morality issue when you specifically seek to subvert the rules in order to gain an unfair advantage.

null,false,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,null,"&gt; After Ralph Miliband died in 1994 his assets transferred to his wife, Marion. Soon afterwards his will was changed via a so-called âdeed of variationâ to give 20 per cent of the family home to each of his two sons, David and Ed.

&gt; The property was sold in 2004 to David Miliband: there was no liability for inheritance tax because his mother was still alive.

&gt; Had she died before that sale the arrangement from a decade earlier would have minimised the familyâs tax liabilities. That is because each individual has a tax-free threshold on which no inheritance tax is paid, currently set at Â£325,000. By sharing a property between several people a family can diminish the tax owed.

This is nonsense from the FT and I'd expect them to know better.

Inheritance tax is paid before the estate is divided up.  If person A dies and leaves everything to person B, who then dies and leaves everything to person C, there is inheritance tax set up at each stage.  Deeds are variation are there so that person B can say ""Actually, don't give it to me, give it straight to person C.""

When Ralph Miliband died and left all his estate to his wife, his wife used a rule in law specifically designed for the purpose to make it so that Ralph's will actually left something to his children instead.  They would have had to pay inheritance tax on this within the existing law (ie anything over Â£150k at 40%).  She doesn't have to pay any inheritance tax because she is his spouse.  When she dies she will inherit any of the Â£150k that they didn't use up (as of 2007), plus her own allowance (now Â£350k), before you start paying inheritance tax.

ie his inheritance tax bill will be identical what it would have been if they'd just left it with his mum and waited until she died (she hasn't done yet).  In fact, she could have taken it all, sold it, given the money to David and Ed and then they wouldn't have had to pay any inheritance tax because it's been more than 7 years since then *and* they wouldn't have had to pay capital gains because the house wouldn't have been counted as a second property.

What it says is the DISTRIBUTION has changed since 1977.  It doesn't mean that anybody has got poorer.

To give a simple example:

Imagine in 1977, a proletarian earned say Â£8K in today's money, the median was Â£12K in today's money, and the investment banker earned say Â£30K in today's money.

Then say over 35 years, the proletarian's wage doubled, the median went up by 3X, and the investment banker's salary went up by 5X.

If we compare salaries, wages are more unequal in relative terms, but everybody is better off in absolute terms.

...and that more or less, is exactly what has happened.

&gt;Police Scotland's chief constable said the force had not wanted to release stop-and-search data because it was ""not fit for public consumption""

&gt;It was given to the BBC under freedom of information legislation.

&gt;BBC Scotland revealed police had not discontinued searching under-12s as they had promised in June last year. 

&gt;Police said they shared concerns about the capacity of younger children to give ""informed consent"" to be searched.

&gt;The Scottish Police Authority meeting was called after BBC Scotland reported that the data released by Police Scotland had shown 356 children aged under 12 had been subject to ""consensual"" searches, despite assurances from the force that the practice would cease[...]

&gt;He said IT problems with data collection meant many other incidents of consensual stop-searches of children had been incorrectly recorded. 

&gt;The chief constable said IT problems had been identified before the data was released to the BBC.

&gt;Following questions on why the Scottish Police Authority was not made aware of the 18 searches until now, Sir Stephen said he accepted that Police Scotland ""made mistakes"".

As of the current tax year that no longer applies, and you are now like everyone else in being fully one thing or the other (although what you are can still vary from contract to contract).

So it's certainly possible that the company were correct in withholding class 1 NICs but not tax.

null,false,Subotan,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,null,"Yes, but not just specifically Dresden. The USA and especially the UK committed a war crime with the entire strategic bombing campaign over Europe during the Second World War. This is for several reasons:

* The strategic bombing campaign did not end the war sooner as it had a minimal effect on industrial production, and it is a fallacy to say that Allied Command faced a trade-off between bombing and letting the war continue. Industrial economies are too big and too complex to be crippled by explosions, and the Nazis had enough control over their economy that they easily adapted to the reality of continuous bombing. Production rose throughout 1943 and most of 1944 as it was dispersed, repaired, or replaced, with notable exceptions such as the Ploesti oil fields in Romania which were practically glassed by the USAAF and throttled the supply of oil to the Nazis. Moreover, that the bombing had little impact upon production should have been entirely predictable from the British experience of a negligible impact on output from the Blitz.

* Strategic bombing was notoriously inaccurate. It is fundamentally impossible with the technology of the 1940s to bomb a specific factory from thousands of feet up, in complete darkness, when the most elaborate targeting system you have is pushing your bombs out of a hole in the bottom of your plane. It was a huge logistical challenge to even *find* the city you were supposed to bomb, let alone your military target. This was why carpet bombing was introduced, so that one bomb in a hundred might at least come close to destroying something useful to the war effort.

* The British strategic bombing campaign targeted civilians, referred to euphemistically as ""morale"". Inner city neighborhoods were a target of Bomber Command, and the introduction of incendiary bombs was a means to achieve this after testing with simulated working class German homes showed them to burn exceptionally well. This was done under the bizarre theory that a ""demoralised"" population - newly homeless, poverty-struck and physically and emotionally injured - would turn against the Nazi state and impact the war effort. Again, the evidence from Britain clearly showed that civilian populations don't respond that way, and making civilians utterly dependent upon the totalitarian state for survival only *increased* their support for National Socialism and the war effort. (Italy is an interesting counter-example however, given Italy's incompetent dictatorship and air defence systems. Italians felt the state was doing nothing to help them, in contrast to Germany which attempted to provide relief, and the much smaller campaign against Italy was a key driver of Italy's exit from the Axis Powers).

* The air campaigns were extraordinarily expensive, and consumed about 40% of Britain's total production for the war effort. It's notable that the Soviet Union never bothered with strategic bombing considering they faced a much more immediate and deadly threat from National Socialism - if strategic bombing was effective, then the Soviets should have at least dabbled in it, right? They didn't because strategic bombing was bad value for money, and resources that could have been consumed dropping bombs on specific factories from thousands of feet up in the dark were better spent killing Nazis immediately in front of you. These resources Britain spent could instead have been deployed in Burma, or with the Soviets, or in the Atlantic, or in North Africa and Italy, but they weren't. Strategic bombing was therefore driven by political necessity - not even out of obligation to Stalin but to demonstrate to domestic populations in the UK and USA that the government was doing *something* to fight the Nazis, and bombing offered a way of *showing* that with minimal casualties and risk. This is why criticism of the campaign was suppressed during the war, and prominent pre-war critics of bombing were cajoled into either reversing their opinion or silence.

* The only reason senior commanders in the Luftwaffe were never indicted for strategic bombing against the Allies was despite an early push by Allied governments for it to be included in the Nuremburg Trials, upon legal advice it became clear that the grounds used to prosecute would also apply to the Allies themselves.

It goes without saying that National Socialism was the most hideous evil the world has ever seen, and the crocodile tears of Pegida Neo-Nazis in Dresden are clearly grotesque and insincere. But the strategic bombing campaigns carried out by the Allies against Europe - both fascist and occupied - were immoral, and it is Britain's, our greatest moral blindspot about the war that it is rationalized away even by intelligent and ethical people as ""Awful but necessary"". It wasn't necessary, it was a failure and a crime, and it makes me retch to think that we have statues of men like ""Bomber"" Harris in our capital in celebration of it.

You seem to be confusing a three-year forecast with ""the inflation rate"", i.e. the instantaneous rate and the one which is targeted. You also appear to be using at best the wrong figures, since CPI inflation hasn't been above 2% since 2013, and the RPI dropped below 2% in December 2014 as well. The IMF claiming that inflation will average 1.9% over three years is equivalent to saying ""we expect the BoE to meet their inflation target for most of the reporting period, and that some below-target inflation will occur"". Inflation will at no point ""go batshit crazy"", because we have an inflation targeting regime which will sacrifice pretty much any other monetary or economic objective in pursuit of 2% (the merit of which is debatable at best), and because we are a floating currency with full monetary authority in a mostly-homogenous economy and low rates of capital flight, achieving the target is almost always possible when approaching from above. The current situation is noteworthy and unusual because for political and economic reasons, interest rates are effectively forbidden from rising, which would be the usual way of pushing inflation back to target. Thus the threat of more QE and similar more creative/exotic measures, which defer the inflationary impact of printing more money in balance sheet terms at least for several years.

Burke was outstanding. He's been an empty shirt for much of the season I think but on the few times he's actually turned up he's looked very good. And I'm happy that Antonio is looking the part again now too.

A run might be fanciful. I still think that one bad game might send doubts throughout the squad and they'll go back to navel gazing again, but you never know.

You have to think if it's the fault of the prison for not letting them in, or the fault of the newspaper for having such a terrible reputation. 

Not that I think everything the guardian prints is terrible. Just that they have an obvious consistent bias that damages their public relations.",null,0,null,1423850511,null,0,1423850797,0,cokhelt,null,t3_2vs1k0,null,t1_cokhelt,null,t1_cokfk8r,null,null,null,1424570417,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

I really liked that exchange from Flatline. he has no self imposed delusions as to who and what he is.

Yes, I'm part of a larger system, but I'm still one vote. As far as this election goes, a vote for a party with no chance of winning is equivalent to no vote at all, influentially (Ouro brought up a valid point regarding the deposit, but again, that's not what I should be voting for).

Sure, if I'd pledged a lifelong allegiance to the party I want to vote for in *this* election, then thinking long-term would be fine, but I haven't. I have no idea who I'll want to vote for in 5 years time, let alone in 15+ years when my current favoured party might have a chance of winning. My vote in this election is for the party I most agree with now, and the manifesto they have now and the state of the country as it is now. Voting to benefit a party in future elections is not why one should vote, it's not a reason to vote and if I end up preferring another party, I'd end up once again doing more damage through participation with no benefit.

Edit: [Donkey votes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_vote). It's a term applied mostly to the Australian system, but it's applicable to any obligatory, or even uninteresting votes (as in the US).",null,0,null,1423850538,null,0,1423851800,0,cokhf76,null,t3_2uv9f2,null,t1_cokhf76,null,t1_cojrpyl,null,null,null,1424570425,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null
