Liverpool spend the next half an hour trying to score. 30 shots on target are all saved by the hero keeper, and the crowd start chanting his name. Sturridge pulls up injured after yet another shot gets saved. His hamstring has had enough. 

The game enters penalties, where both Mignolet and the Blackburn goalkeeper keep out every spot kick. Eventually, it is sudden death. 10 penalties on both sides have been saved. It is up to the young 17 year-old to save the day. He walks up, determined. The crowd goes silent. He runs up, does a flip, 360 spin, and rabonas the ball into the back of the net!

But you're correct that sacking Rodgers doesn't mean Klopp is gonna be beating down our door, so Liverpool HAS to accept one of two options:

1.) Accept that we are no longer capable of attracting top talent.  End of.  Try to become (as I've seen some people on this forum call it) a ""youth team"" ala Southampton that builds homegrown talent.  Maybe we can compete for CL/Titles in 3-5 years time.

2.) Pay out the ass for top talent.  United obviously did this over the summer.  They finished seventh but were able to pick up Di Maria and Falcao.  City overpaid and now, while they still tend to overpay, they can actually attract talent based on their credentials.  Chelsea overpaid for years, and now players legitimately WANT to play for Chelsea based on their team and reputation.  They're also starting to build some homegrown talent.

That's how they've chosen to get their money, just as you chose to work in the shop for money and I chose to work in an office for money (I say ""chose"" loosely, but that's a digression into politics and I'm not letting that particular harpy off it's leash). They've just ducked the system and chose to exploit people's generosity or charity, rather than do traditional work.

I'm more interested in what annoys you about it more, if I'm honest. I mean, I think (and I could be wrong) you're annoyed because they live a decent lifestyle while putting in no effort. I can understand why that annoys you because you have to work, and take orders from your boss and deal with customers and put up with all sorts of shite to make money and these guys sit around and do nothing. If that's what's bugging you then all it is is jealousy and a sense of unfairness.

So there's a couple of things you can do:

- Go out begging yourself and see if you end up better off or not (if you can't beat 'em, join 'em sort of a way). 
- Or you can you go out counter-begging to make everyone aware that they don't need the charity because they aren't in dire straits, they're just begging because they'd rather not work.

Some caution with that second one though, you might just get your head kicked in for your effort, or the polis might get you for harassment... depends how you go about it.

I suppose the other avenues, slender as they are, would be to shop them to HMRC for tax evasion. After all, they have an income (and not an unsubstantial one from what you've said). It would be interesting to know whether they are actually declaring and paying tax on it.

Or you could try and investigate their benefit status, and work out whether they're claiming benefits and making money. The last two aren't really worth the effort and no-one will really give much of a fuck for spending the needed time or money to investigate and prosecute them.

It seems like losing a place in government at this stage would just confirm to everyone that the Lib-Dem surge around the last election was a one-off fluke, they're weak and untrustworthy just like all the other politicians, and all the traditional rhetoric about a vote for the Lib Dems being a wasted vote were true.

&gt;Other big clubs can look back on winning squads but we can't the same way. Do we even had two good seasons in a row? Because of that, that we can't point on a winning squad it comes down to players even if football is a team sport. United have never had more 2? seasons of not winning any title and thats for the most big clubs in Europe. 

So because the squad isn't as good there is more pressure on the individual players? If you are talking about a single marque player, like Suarez, then maybe but not for most. 

Most of the world doesn't look at Liverpool. When United finished 7th last year the entire world knew it. They sacked a coach handpicked by their worshipped SAF before 1 season was up. They were under enormous pressure to get back into the top 4 this year. Even players as good as di Maria are getting stick. He'd be worshipped at Liverpool.

have to say, i need to give credit where it is due, and arsenal just flat out played us off the pitch. i think the team, if we can ensure we keep hold of cou, studge, sterling and hendo, should be very confident. we can definitely attract a few big names, people who believe in the project. and a few more young, potential superstars. i know i've been fighting tooth and nail on this, but the problem is that our strategy must involve signing promising talents. we have to start lower and build ourselves back up. revenues will go up, the stadium is being built and sponsors are pouring in, but we need to build the squad from young age up because we can afford to buy established stars. it's just not going to happen. we might be able to nick 1 or 2, but otherwise, we need to build from potential stars and entrust a young squad with responsibility. if sturridge can stay healthy and raheem stays period, i think the team should feel very good going into next season. i mean we went undefeated for 13 matches with this same squad and they're only going to get better because they're so young. that's the project we need to sell and hopefully we can get a top 4 next year.

We brought Suarez, Sterling, Hendo etc., all not world class stars and they've turned out well. When Suarez left, Sterling stepped up and became our best player. Yes we need to keep those players, but the actual idea isn't bad at all. It's sort of like how Porto/Ajax are run, but the idea would be to keep a far larger number of developed top players. It's a pretty good idea, especially in a world where the Chelsea's and City's of the world can spend 30M on a player only so the opposition can't have him. If we can consistently produce top players by developing them, I'd imagine we'd be much better off instead of having to spend 30M every summer. 

Where we run into problems is two fold. One, is identifying talent. We miss on far too many for us to consistently have this work and secondly, keeping it. The first one sort of compounds onto the second one. Missing on guys like Aspas, Alberto etc., really hurt us. If we can hit on 3-4 guys in one window and make a nice core of players, I have no doubt guys would stay here and we'd have less problems. With how it stands now, players want to leave because we don't have enough quality around them. 

Buying stars works if your a Chelsea, or City, or United, or even Wolfsburg, For us, we're more Dortmund and Roma than the other teams.

Worst of all for me, when the shit hit the fan, he hid. I know he's going, but he was literally hiding from the player in possession (have a watch back if you don't remember this) in that second half.

Elderly Health Care, which costs a vast amount of money in Britain, £120Billion last year I believe, is virtually non-existent in EU countries, Spain especially. 

In Europe the families are expected to wash and feed their elderly. In fact it is generally customary for the elderly person to live with the family, unlike in Britain where we tend to use very expensive care homes.

But two things happened. One - we got Sturridge back. So no longer was the 3-4-3 the way to get our best players in the game. With Sturridge in the lineup we're basically trading Coutinho/Llallana/Sterling for the extra centreback. Unless we play one of them at right back (which is a waste of their offensive talent).

This causes a boom and bust of deficits in demand when the government hasn't responded and surplus of demand when government eventually does - causing inflationary pressure. This is resolved by central banks increasing interest rates but then this depresses private sector demand. 

The consensus was based around the principle that because governments are rarely 'on point' with their interventions that they are far better to focus on the supply side of the economy and improving productivity and attracting foreign direct investment and leave the demand to wax and wane naturally. 

This is fine logic, but the problem is the global financial crisis was no usual was and wane - we were staring into the deep dark of the longest recession we've ever seen, government intervention wasn't just desirable - but essential. 

And in that moment we did the absolute worst thing and reduced government investment in the economy, both damaging productivity and crippling demand - especially considering that investors were looking to governments for leadership, we went ahead and said 'the economy is fucked'.

Honestly, Chadli has been immense this season. To think that he needs to be replaced because of a few games seems ridiculous. He has suffered a little dip in form since his father passed, who can blame him. But overall, he's got one less goal than Eriksen and 3 MORE assists.

This is kind of how I felt over the summer or a few months into the season when people were complaining we bought too many young players in the transfer window and not enough established talent. 

Fact is we could never afford enough established talent to make up anything like a full XI, let alone a proper squad, so all we can really do is get youngsters and hope we get more Coutinhos and Sterlings than we do Bruno Cheyrous. And OK maybe that should still leave us enough money to buy the odd marquee signing or two. but what's the point of buying a world-class 29 year old when they'll be getting past it by the time the rest of the squad really starts to come good?

There's always something tacky and fake about the preferred styles that seems largely nonexistant elsewhere. Like the girl said in the video, everyone looks the same!

But as /u/donttrustasoulhomie said, these people have spent a lot of time, money and dedication to get where they are and that's a good quality. I often find I completely lack the motivation to do anything to improve myself (outside of school and university where what motivated me was not wanting to get bad grades) and I wish I could figure out how to conjure some up like these people do.

Growing up in the valleys is a tough existance and many people like myself moved out for work (though for me it was a choice rather than something I felt I had to do). However there are some opportunities for people in engineering/manufacturing, and a number of major companies have operations there (BAE Systems, General Dynamics and Airbus all have sites across South Wales). I think the valleys could become a promising place for engineering companies to set up shop as the industry grows.

However change and improvement has to come from within, and I think living in an environment where everyone is in the same difficult situation makes it hard to see what exactly you're missing out on and how it can be improved. I remember in school I saw a lot of people who were capable but just didn't make the effort because many other people didn't, and that set the general standard people worked toward. Yet working hard at school and getting a good education can open up a wealth of opportunities. Give people a better understanding of what they're capable of achieving and some targets to reach and they'll work for them. These people work hard for their appearance because they know it's something they can achieve as they see people all around them doing it. They can achieve lots more as well but lack peers they can compare themselves to who have already done it.

I'm not sure about that... and I say that as a Lib-Dem voter.

Nobody took the Lib-Dems seriously for years - they were always the wishy-washy, nothing, joke party little better than the Greens or Monster Raving Loony Party.  People used to argue (hell, still do) that a Lib-Dem vote was a wasted vote, and people voting for them were being silly and naive because even if you hated Labour/the Tories [it was better to vote for the Tories/Labour](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/162557-it-comes-from-a-very-ancient-democracy-you-see-you) to prevent the *other* party (who you hated even more) from getting in.

Eventually after successive Tory and Labour governments both successively fucked up badly the Lib Dems experienced a sudden surge of popularity and protest-votes (primarily amongst people sick of the two main parties and/or idealistic students, both looking for an alternative to yet more years of Tory/Labour he-said/she-said bullshit) that temporarily overwhelmed the general background assumption that it was pointless voting for them.

That gave them a substantial boost in the political scene, but they still didn't achieve anywhere *near* a majority - they got [just enough to tip the scales](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/) between Labour and the Tories, who were otherwise deadlocked.

And remember, that was at the peak of their popularity - during a sudden fad that said ""screw it - let's *try* voting for someone other than more Labour or Tories for once and see what happens"".

In the end they go into power as the junior coalition partner and gained some legitimacy as a ""serious"" political option, but if that freak tidal wave of enthusiasm had crested, collapsed and drained away and they ended up *still* not in power, *still* not achieving much and still a dismissed minority in parliament, I strongly suspect that it would merely have confirmed for people that yes, voting for Lib-Dem *was* a wasted vote, because even when they were more popular than they'd been in a generation, ultimately it still didn't mean squat.

In taking power they also had to compromise on their pledges and lost a lot of credibility with their supporters, but they now have five years of practical experience in government behind them, granting them at least credibility if not popularity.

If they'd ridden the crest of the wave right up to the election and ended up still not in government, with nothing but a relatively paltry  57 seats, I think it would merely have confirmed to everyone that they *were* nothing but a fad, and people would have gone back to simply not voting or voting for the *other* lizard.",null,0,null,1428329930,null,0,1428330123,0,cq2xz4j,null,t3_31mdnk,null,t1_cq2xz4j,null,t1_cq2wez8,null,null,null,1432225817,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

If we're comparing to football clubs, we need to be working off the United/Arsenal style of financial buildup, as they've grown without ridiculous external cash injections.

We need that investment in the stadium, badly. Our matchday revenue is well below Arsenal and United's, and thats one of the reasons why we can't keep up. European football qualification is all performance based. Matchday revenue is one of those things that regardless of our performance, we will be receiving that money because Anfield will sell out. I like to think of it as government spending in a Keynesian system, as that investment spurs on everything else. It'll create a feedback loop where we've got more money, buy better players, spend more on wages, get into the CL consistently, earn more money, etc. But to start that feedback loop we need that investment into our stadium (or a massive Arab owner). 

We've started building, the growth will come. We will become more financially competitive, and that will translate into our long term club getting stronger. But we have to make sure we're growing faster than Arsenal and United are, as well as Tottenham and West Ham who are planning on moving into new stadiums as well.

Well the truth is if you're skilled almost all locks with an exposed keyway are susceptible to picking. Some are of course more difficult than others with quality of manufacture and devices like notched pins and tumblers helping. It's often said but if a thief really wants your bike then little can be done to stop them, it's mostly about deterrents. As such the Squire is a pretty imposing looking lock, it's weighty and solid. The [MOD use it](http://securityforbikes.com/security-chains.php) and Squire are a reputable company.

Picking a lock can take an indeterminate amount of time, even if you're pretty skilled you can't guarantee to be able to open it as quickly as you could, say, cut a small chain or security wire. So thieves will generally avoid trying to pick locks if at all possible, therefore any half-decent solid looking lock (in my opinion) is a good option, the more expensive ones may give you greater peace-of-mind.",null,0,null,1428331175,null,0,false,0,cq2ym5j,null,t3_31jtmz,null,t1_cq2ym5j,null,t1_cq2y2ks,null,null,null,1432226195,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

The government is currently worried as the average age of truck drivers is heading towards 60 and most will be retiring in the next 10 years. Demand is only going to increase. We already tried the Eastern European experiment in the boom of the 2000's and it was an unmitigated disaster costing companies far more in damages to vehicles and loads and lost work than they saved on the wage bill so there's no fear of swathes of Poles coming in to fill the vacancies.

The Drivers CPC brought in in September created an additional shortage just as the economy started to pick up as many drivers decided they didn't want to do it and were near retirement so didn't bother and that meant less available to employ. To give you an idea of the impact of the DCPC, wages in my relatively low paid for the job area shot up by £2/hr in 4 months - a 25% increase.

Pay wise agency or contract, a C+E driver shouldn't be setting foot in a lorry for under £10/hr. If you're in the Midlands where there's a lot of manufacturing and distribution centres, £14-£15/hr isn't unreasonable.

These advertised jobs do actually exist. We've gone back to the good old days at the height of the boom in the Noughties where companies are back to advertising drivers wanted on the backs of trailers, on boards outside their yards and agencies advertising on roadside hoardings. I do not know of one single person with a HGV license who isn't working. The guy I'm working for is consistently short of drivers and asking if I know anyone who wants work, the agency I'm subcontracted to is consistently sending texts out asking if anyone is available and offering extra pay to anyone who is. They can't even fulfill bookings at what is regarded as the best company to drive for in the county. There is so much work out there I'm picking and choosing who I work for and the days I work on a daily basis should I choose - I would point out though that I've 22 years experience and someone starting out won't be able to do that to begin with.

BTW pretty much all HGV driving is unsociable. The average working week is 55hrs and you're usually either starting or finishing around 4am in the morning. Maximum legal working day is 15hrs. If you want 40hrs a week and 8hr working days, look elsewhere.

In theory Van Ginkel and Loftus-Cheek could fill this role if given the chance but who knows how good they'd be in their first season back and Van Ginkel is also made of glass, a world class player would be less of a risk but obviously more expensive.

Other than that to be actually complete the team needs at least one more quality attacking midfielder/ winger given it's currently 4 players for 3 positions.

Because a girl should have long hair, she should have clean hair; because she should have clean hair, she should not have an unclean home; because she should not have an unclean home, she should have a free and leisured mother; because she should have a free mother, she should not have an usurious landlord; because there should not be an usurious landlord, there should be a redistribution of property; because there should be a redistribution of property, there shall be a revolution.

That little urchin with the gold-red hair, whom I have just watched toddling past my house, she shall not be lopped and lamed and altered; her hair shall not be cut short like a convict’s; no, all the kingdoms of the earth shall be hacked about and mutilated to suit her. She is the human and sacred image; all around her the social fabric shall sway and split and fall; the pillars of society shall be shaken, and the roofs of ages come rushing down, and not one hair of her head shall be harmed.""

Also, I think it'll have a big impact at the margin. After the loan period, we'll see an increase of revenue. This is important, because assuming the current state of the club (which is presumptive but I think a reasonable assumption), any increased profit from ticket sales won't be tied to any other costs, and will be dispensable income that will allow us to invest in better players/wages/staff/facilities. Essentially, the profit from it will be directly available for further investment.

null,false,rnessy,null,null,null,"I disagree. Tottenham don't have a lot of young talent, many of their high profile players are in their prime or nearly there and lack longevity while I think we are a different case. Arsenal are playing excellently right now but I remember earlier in the season when I thought they and wenger were trash with only Alexis holding them together. They're good but one of us is only better than the other in form. City are built on a base of sand, look at them falling to fourth even now. Their problem is that they do not build teams, they buy high profile players and expect them to slot in like puzzle pieces, that's not how players and teams work, it might be working now but when their money bags start to fail they'll crash and burn. As much as I hate to say it I think United won't fade, though I'd hoped it at the beginning of the season. They have too much support, too much money, and a youth program to help them. Chelsea, while funded similarly to city, have a better manager and financial backer than their mega rich counterparts City, because of that I don't think they'll fade like a City may and God forbid city learning to put themselves together like Chelsea has. Point being, all of these clubs, ourselves included, have the capabilities to field strong squads and while we may not be in a title challenge now, we certainly have potential for that to materialize. We have a strong fan base, a squad and manager with youth and vision, and not the coffers of city, Chelsea, or United, but enough support from FSG, who have been excellent for us in their time in power, to be really good squad and contend for at least top four.

There were also *""an estimated 124,000 non-EU long-term study-related migrants""*.

The numbers would suggest that introducing a fee could stand to raise a reasonable sum of money. Crude envelope maths indicates charging £150 to each of the above students would have raised about £19 million. It's not a massive amount in the context of the NHS's £97 billion annual budget, but its money that could go towards better health screening and GP registration of young migrant students. Most come from asia and south-east asia where vaccination and public health programmes are poor by comparison to ours - and tropical and sexually transmitted diseases are more prevalent. 

If you then include economic migrants coming here to work from outside the EEA I suspect this raises a decent amount of capital. I also suspect it's laying the groundwork for future rises. I would argue slowly building up to £500-1000 a year could arguably be justified. The NHS offers a very comprehensive level of coverage compared to other health systems, and costs the UK about 10% of GDP so access to it should not be taken for granted by migrants.

I see opinions that he'll be our captain next year, and that he's one of our best players. 

Reality is, as a defender he's frequently caught out of position, and relies way too much on his physicality to get him out of situations. He's mediocre as an attacking full back at best, mostly because he doesn't have/want to produce the movement of a modern, attacking fullback - getting wide, overlaps, bombing on, etc.

Technically, he's decent, but if we compared him to Lucas, Allen, or Hendo then he's clearly the worst one of that group technically. His physicality makes up for some of that, but thats not what our system needs.

I think this sub needs to drop some of the #ynwafamily super optimisim.

We had an awful first half of the season for many reasons and had to go on a run of league winning form just to get back into contention for fourth. A few injuries, some bad choices and now we're hoping for other teams to mess up in order to get fourth but really its more likely we'll end 5th-7th.

There's problems in the squad. You can't just dismiss the contract stuff and if we finish outside the top 4 you have to wonder who we're going to sign. I do actually have faith in our transfer committee looking at their past signings but thosek who have been reported to Rodger's have been disappointing.

If ManU get CL they'll massively reinforce and will be hard to dislodge next season.

I've been an LFC fan for 30 years and I've always been an optimist but since December I think I've been done with Rodgers. I don't like the way he treats players he doesn't like. Borini and Balotelli might have gotten us some goals if they'd been integrated more. What's the point in using experts to buy players (Assaidi, Manquillo, Aspas, Alberto, etc) if the manager isn't going to bomb them straight out. And I wish he'd talk less. Two weeks ago we were targeting 2nd, now he says we can't get 4th. Just makes him look foolish. I also worry in big games he's not up to the job.

Be careful about suddenly stopping diazepam though if you've been taking it for a while, you could get a pretty unpleasant withdrawal. You'll want to arrange a GP consultation as soon as you get back to the UK. 

Honestly, it is in your best interest to get this addressed by a proper doctor in the UK and not just buy dangerous over the counter medicines in Cambodia from some quack.

Main thing is though, Izzy Brown should get on the pitch. He's 6ft, tall enough to get the ball in the air, if not really strong enough yet, won't cost us anything new and is a fair bit quicker than everyone else I've mentioned.

To improve our AM it's either spend a bucket or spend nothing imo.

I am sure our Summer will not include a lot of movement, but here is what I have gathered from all of the hints we have received from the club this year, as well as what has been rumored in the media at least a few times. 



What may happen:


-Sale of Oscar

-Sale of Ramires

-Felipe Luis wants more playing time

-Sale of Cech (for sure)

-Drogba stops playing

-Remy wants more playing time

-Terry phases out over 2015/16 season (maybe doesn't play every game)




We may need:


-A striker to replace Drogba

-A new defensive midfielder to sub for and play with Matic (Matic type or Ramires type?)

-A new CB (could do in winter)

-A young LB

-A new number 10 to replace Oscar, if sold

-Older GK as a number 2



People of interest:

-OUR YOUTH!!

-Striker Icardi

-Def Mid Khedira

-Central Mid Pogba

-Number 10 Douglas Costa

-CB Varane

-Number 10 and winger Filipe Anderson

-GK Rob Green

-Young left back?

 [**Betteridge's law of headlines**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s%20law%20of%20headlines): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Betteridge's law of headlines__ is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) that states: ""Any [headline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline) that ends in a [question mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_mark) can be answered by the word *no*."" It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist,  although the general concept is much older.  The observation has also been called ""__Davis' law__""   or just the ""__journalistic principle__"".  In the field of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics), the concept, referring to the titles of research papers, has been referred to as __Hinchliffe's Rule__  since before 1988.

This is absolute bullshit. I'm sorry but Rodger's was ready to let Henderson go to Fulham and Skrtel was benched in Rodgers first season.

One thing Rodgers has shown is that he will drop players on bad form (Sterling after his early burst faded) and bring people back in who seemed to have been cold shouldered (even Downing was brought back into the fold ffs)

1. The Cornish used to have [their own language](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cornish.htm), similar to Welsh, which is making a resurgence. So, if you hear someone say, ""[Myttin da](http://www.omniglot.com/soundfiles/cornish/goodmorning_kw.mp3),"", it just means good morning. 

2. This also why cornish people use the word, ""Emmet,"" which means ant. As you are a foreigner, you will be called an Emmet due to the fact that cornish people have trouble finding houses because 'foreigners' are buying second homes and only staying in them for 2 days of the year or something stupid like that. 

*side note: When you arrive in Cornwall, don't let yourself believed that you're a time traveller and that you've gone back to that weird, Saved by the Bell, part of the 1990s where the 1980s are trying to die and the 1990s are trying to define themselves in the way that they have no original way of defining themselves. That's just how Cornish people dress. Because it's so far from London, the second homes thing, and the fact that Londoners only really come here on holiday (legally required vacation) Cornwall is not well kept up to date with the current fads and fashions going on around the world. You will see quite a few hipsters, but still expect to see large numbers of: windbreakers, fleece jackets, choker necklaces, et cetera. But, on the bright side, spandex, shoulder pads, and leg warmers died out at the same time as everywhere else. 

3. When arranging a meeting, many Cornish people tend to add the suffix -ish to a time if they know the general time they're going to be there, but aren't sure about the specific time (e.g.: I'll meet you at Falmouth Road at around 12ish, outside the pasty shop). 

4. A Cornish pasty (pronounced past-ee) is a beef skirt, swede (rutabaga), and potato (**but not carrots or peas**) pie-type foodstuff which you can hold in your hand and can get from almost any bakery. 

5. When saying their fairwells, a Cornish person will probably say, ""dreckly,"" in the place of later. So, ""see you dreckly"" and ""see you later"" mean exactly the same thing. 

6. After some hard work, a job well done, or when a good thing has come upon them, Cornishmen and Cornishwomen may say ""'ansom"" or ""proper job"" to express their satisfaction. 

These are just some of the things you'll need to know. So, do some research so you have a clear understanding.

&gt;Lib-Lab Pact
&gt;
&gt;In March 1977 the Labour Government, left with no overall majority following a by-election defeat, faced a motion of no confidence. In order to remain in office, Prime Minister James Callaghan approached the Liberal Party under the leadership of David Steel. Callaghan had been prime minister for just one year, having succeeded Harold Wilson who had led Labour to a three-seat majority in October 1974.
&gt;
&gt;An agreement was negotiated, under the terms of which the Labour Party accepted a limited number of Liberal Party policy proposals and in exchange, the Liberal Party agreed to vote with the government in any subsequent motion of no confidence. **While this 'pact' was the only official bi-party agreement since the Second World War** (until the Conservative–Lib Dem coalition following the 2010 election), **it fell far short of a coalition**. The Lib–Lab Pact's end was confirmed on 7 September 1978,[1] by which time Callaghan was expected to call a general election, but instead he decided to continue as leader of a minority government until May 1979, when after a vote of no confidence it was forced to hold a general election, in which Margaret Thatcher led the Conservatives back into power.

The Tort lecturer is amazing, he's a hilarious Welsh guy.  
It's not that difficult of a step up particularly, it helps that you're now only doing one subject instead of 3/4/5. Some of it can be challenging but it's nothing you can't handle if you don't mind getting your head down and studying.

Matic joins our defence and doesn't actually make a midfield to work through. He joins the defensive line and presses from it. Fabregas joins the forwards. We haven't had a proper midfield as such for years. 

Positionally Fabregas doesn't know where to be to stop the pass or to stop the attack. Instead he just clips someone from behind and presses a bit. Matic does know how to play that role but can't because his positional play relies on also having someone else to stop him just being passed around. As such that's why he joins the defence. He still presses a bit in fairness but he can't too much because if he gets passed around then he ends up still needing to be another 10 yards further back goal side. 

Our formation is essentially the same as Southampton most of the time but our midfield is very different. As much as I appreciate not having a conventional team set up can be an advantage. It is also pretty clear that the way we're set up with so many obvious coverings of weaknesses that it's not ideal and that we don't really have a solid defensive option that works. Even when playing 3 Cms.

I disagree that Mikel is any good in the pivot, he's not mobile enough. Shys away from any long range passes that he hasn't been told beforehand are on and very telegraphed. He isn't a very good tackler and is criminally bad positionally. He just gets in most people's way, both his advantage and his disadvantage. He's an anchor useful in a congested game that lets players get organised. Essentially he just holds up the ball in the middle of the pitch and is thoroughly useless for anything else. There's a reason Ramires was preferred to him in the ""pivot"".

It was barely 22 years ago that the Tories declared they were the party of moral values, and they were going to tell everyone about it...

&gt;""The old values - neighbourliness, decency, courtesy - they're still alive, they're still the best of Britain. They haven't changed, and yet somehow people feel embarrassed by them. Madam President, we shouldn't be. It is time to return to those old core values, time to get back to basics, to self-discipline and respect for the law, to consideration for others, to accepting a responsibility for yourself and your family... The message from this conference is clear and simple, we must go back to basics. We want our children to be taught the best, our public services to give the best, our British industry to be the best and the Conservative Party will lead the country back to those basic rights across the board. Sound money, free trade, traditional teaching, respect for the family and respect for the law."" -- John Major. Conservative Party Conference, 8th October 1993.

That went with Peter Lilley's characterization of single mothers as ""benefit-driven"" and ""undeserving"", and John Redwood's condemnation of ""young women [who] have babies with no apparent intention of even trying marriage or a stable relationship with the father of the child"".

And then the following happened in very quick succession...

Tim Yeo's extramarital affair resulting in him fathering a ""love-child"".

Revelations about the private life of Steve Norris who during the ""back to basics"" era was revealed to have had five mistresses over a 25 year period (something that earned him the nickname ""Shagger"" in the tabloid media).

Hartley Booth quits as a Parliamentary Private Secretary over a ""friendship"" with a Commons researcher.

The Earl of Caithness resigned from his post as Foreign Office Minister after his wife committed suicide due to his extra-marital affair.

Conservative MP Stephen Milligan's accidental death by auto-erotic asphyxiation on February 7, 1994. [This was a juicy one for the papers](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/mps-bizarre-death-jolts-tories-body-of-rising-commons-star-discovered-dressed-only-in-stockings-and-suspenders-1392666.html), making for good inspirational material for Mansun's song ""Stripper Vicar"" at the time. 

MP Michael Brown's involvement with a then-underage man in 1994.

David Ashby discovered to have shared a bed with a man on a trip paid by expenses. Ashby was married at the time.

The scandals went into '95 and '96, and these are just the sex ones. They don't even include the Fayed cash for question stuff (Michael Brown had a sex AND a money scandal).

Kalou was just plain dodgy, rarely had a good game. He wasn't that good ever. I'm trying to think of an appropriate player comparison.

null,false,JustAhobbyish,null,null,null,"&gt; That isn't how quantitative easing works. The whole reason QE is used by the BoE is because asset purchases can be reversed quite easily (i.e. the assets can be sold again). Borrowing for investment spending (which I agree we should have done far more of, but for different reasons and in different ways) doesn't work that way.

BoE quantitative easing goal was monetary stimulus cheap money and stimulus within the economy. Problem was the assets did not go back into the real economy.  Money instead has deflated assets [UK borrowing] and sitting in banks.  Business loans are now in stagnation. Quantitative easing is already unconventional to start with and that idea is just putting the money into something more productive which becomes a real stimulus. Of course it would not be simple to do would need some more detail. BoE is out of tools almost may be forced to get radical start looking outside of the neoclassical playbook. 

&gt; An utterly terrible idea that would have completely porked the economy twice over. Lehman Brothers failing was bad enough, and they were just an investment bank; if an RBS or a Lloyds had gone down, even if deposits were safe it would still completely fuck the banking system over and wreck consumer confidence, not to mention market confidence. Bear in mind that banks do more than hold money - they lend money too. The grind to a halt of new lending was bad enough; the cessation of existing credit facilities to businesses and consumers, coupled with the inevitable disruption, would have been such an enormous shock we would have completely fucked the economy six ways from Sunday.
When anyone ever says we should have let the banks go to the wall, they need a good hard slap. Brown's move was pragmatic and reasonable, if not something everyone can fully agree with.
All this said, there is an excellent argument that whether or not the Tories ruined the economy, they certainly destroyed whatever recovery was showing in 2010 and took exactly the incorrect course of action. Osborne is and was an economic illiterate and the Tories' success in painting Labour as such given that is nothing short of incredible.

Terrible but we may have created a set of zombies banks with a zombie banking system that even bigger and can't fail.  Next crisis we're going to be loaded with even more debt if we save them again and the question is how many times do we need to bail out a system that not working? 

Yes it would be brutal and screw over the economy short term.  Would not be a easy choice to make but when you're facing a system which is deeply insolvent only real choice. Iceland made that choice and came out alive. 
Not a easy choice to make or something I would do without thinking. 

Banks do more compared to hold money they bet against the market, make loans bet against that and sell off loans as assets.  Also use massive range derivatives some of which are 1,000 pages long. Complex financial products being traded around and complex market between each bank. 
Brown did show some leadership at that time.  Who knows he was right but got the detail wrong and wasted a wasted opportunity to use the banks owned by the public for fiscal stimulus. 

As for Osborne we can agree on that.

So Cameron can't just call a snap election.  He has to get confidence of the house first, then he has to persuade 2/3 of the house to agree to it.  Or he has to get no confidence in the house and then hope that Labour can't form a government in 14 days that gets a confidence vote.  Realistically the Lib Dems and SNP voting for a no confidence in both the Tories and Conservatives would be a bad idea for them, so they are likely to take a side.


I'm not particularly convinced that the Tories will want a second election.

Porn is an easy target because it's easy to stir up a moral panic over it (see ""[Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse)""). But once you have that infrastructure in place it's a smaller step to censoring other things deemed objectionable. The system used for some popular ISPs [already supports censoring other content as well](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-porn-filter-will-censor-other-content-too-isps-reveal-130726/).

And while at present you have the option of opting out of censorship, it's a trivial software change for them to create a new class of blocked websites that cannot be unblocked. [Five years ago the MoD tried (and failed) to censor Wikileaks](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/records_relating_to_the_activiti_5), for example. That would be an obvious target.

The Internet is unique precisely because it is free and uncontrolled, unlike pretty much every other similar mechanism that has come before it - the printing press, television, etc. These censorship systems are a way of ending that, because ultimately it's a subversive system that is a threat to much of the establishment.

null,false,HistoryLessonforBitc,,Card-carrying Labour supporter,null,"&gt; BoE quantitative easing goal was monetary stimulus cheap money and stimulus within the economy. Problem was the assets did not go back into the real economy.

Which is fine, because that wasn't the point. The point was to take shitty assets off of the banks and recapitalise them so they would lend more. The success of this is debatable at best, but directly stimulating the wider economy wasn't the aim of quantitative easing.

&gt; Terrible but we may have created a set of zombies banks with a zombie banking system that even bigger and can't fail. 

And this is bad because...?

&gt; Next crisis we're going to be loaded with even more debt if we save them again and the question is how many times do we need to bail out a system that not working? 

I'd agree with this, IF we hadn't also instituted stronger banking regulations (as we should have done from the start) and if there weren't already (as of 2009) greater capitalisation requirements on the way as part of Basel. The issue was deregulation which has now been, if not completely then partially reversed.

Banks are not evil in and of themselves. RBS and Lloyds were not evil in and of themselves.

&gt; Yes it would be brutal and screw over the economy short term.

No, not short term. And ""brutal"" is underestimating the effect. You are quite right that you wouldn't want your name on it, especially given that with all due respect to Iceland our economy is just a teensy bit more important, diverse and expansive than Iceland's. There would be an absolute collapse in the confidence of absolutely everyone, and large swathes of people and businesses would become insolvent overnight, coupled with inevitable social unrest and panic - and that's just in the UK.

&gt; Banks do more compared to hold money they bet against the market, make loans bet against that and sell off loans as assets. Also use massive range derivatives some of which are 1,000 pages long. Complex financial products being traded around and complex market between each bank.

And? You say this like it is a terrible or unjust thing. You've not said *why* it is bad, or even that it is bad at all, just that it is there. Do you even know what a derivative *is*, and why ""1000 pages long"" in relation to one is nonsense?

&gt; Who knows he was right but got the detail wrong and wasted a wasted opportunity to use the banks owned by the public for fiscal stimulus. 

Now this I can somewhat agree with, as with our majority ownership of RBS and Lloyds there would have been significant opportunity to use their market presence to achieve policy goals.

Also, you don't need to ban something completely to be totalitarian.  Cigarette smoking in public is banned and it can surely be regarded as totalitarian, as it increase state's authority and control over public and private life alike. Increased camera surveillance is universally regarded as totalitarian, yet it doesn't explicitly ban anything.

Also, what about things that are legal now, that are rather useless and strain the healthcare anyway? The best example of this I can think of is sunbathing. It doesn't help anything, unless you have vitamin D deficiency, and it surely is the leading cause of melanoma, a very serious conditions that costs billions yearly. Should we ban sunbathing because of that?

Sexual assault etc are also supposed to be lower in countries with less restrictions.

Before the Tories did this the biggest anti porn movement was feminism. Which is of course ironic as many women like porn, my SO loves it and the only covered or allowed pro porn narratives where from the women it affected.

null,false,joepo32,null,null,null,"&gt;Why are you trying to rationalize Oscar with pretty much every single excuse in the book and are completely avoiding the only thing that SHOULD be judged, which is his performances.

I'm simply stating a fact. His performances on average have been very well for us. I can't help that you can't see past the last month or so. Even in those games he has played decent. Could he be better? Of course. He is only 23. 

&gt;Oscar has time and time again shown that he has many faults in his game, he is not one of the worlds best at the moment, and has *serious* problems in creativity, consistency, and overall effectiveness. He is not a playmaker, he is not a prolific goalscorer, he is not a tempo controller, and he is not a true defensive threat. His biggest asset is his pressuring and hassling when he puts in a shift defensively, but let us not kid ourselves, he is not a proper defensive midfielder (There is a reason that Jose always plays Ramires instead of him in the big games). And ""pressuring"" that alone cant make you world class.

He isn't ask to be a goal scorer. He actually helps set up a lot of plays. Players contribute to plays even when they don't touch the ball. And Rami isn't replacing Oscar when he plays in games that we need more defensive work. He plays where Fabregas plays. And of course Fabregas would move up and take Oscars spot. Because Fabregas is better than Oscar. I'm not sure how you think Rami replaces Oscar.

null,false,Antsonfire,num18,,null,"The problem with putting it squarely down to Baldini is that Soldado and Paulinho (arguably our biggest failures in terms of money spent-at least we can see improvement from Lamela) were both AVB guys. Eriksen was a good buy when we couldn't get Willian and no one knows where Chadli came from (trying to find that Independent article: Chadli says that none of Baldini, AVB or Levy talked to him, so what the fuck happened there is even more intriguing than picking apart our flops). 

Seriously, the man wanted Hulk, Moutinho and David Villa. The latter two almost happened, and Hulk wanted 12 million pounds to be on loan last summer. Fuck that, Levy must've said. So he (AVB) brings in a guy he vouched for to look for replacements, to fulfill a certain system, only to find out that the players either can't play it or AVB is bad at explaining anything. 

So now we've got Poch, who brought in four players, two of which (Davies and Vorm) are outclassed by our starters, but two of which (Fazio and Stambouli) are inexplicably left out of everything. 

&gt;before Kane got a crack at the job and played so well that he couldn't be denied

To spin this to a positive, you could argue that Kane wouldn't be playing so well were it not for Poch, or even Chadli and Eriksen earlier in the season for that matter. Kane wasn't always a twenty goal a season wonderkid despite what Tim Sherwood wants us to think. It's clear that Poch has played a part in his development. 

I'm not sure where this is going, but I don't think it's all Baldini's fault. I think the only really fucked up purchase was Paulinho. If you want to have a look at Paulinho 1.0, just look up ""Elias Atletico Madrid"". The situations have too many parallels to be called coincidence. Brazilian box to box midfielder goes to up and coming European club, flops, goes to Sporting and is average there. You know who Corinthians brought in to replace Elias when he left? Paulinho. Sandro has been the only succesful transfer from Brazil to England that really comes to mind, honestly. I don't know why we bought from there when Brazilians historically have a hard time adjusting to this league. 

I disagree completely with the idea that Baldini has done his job fairly well though. His purchases (as I've said before, I remember AVB wanting Soldado and Paulinho) have been okay at best (Lamela, Chiriches) and exiled at worst (Capoue).

The damage from that transfer window is going to take so long to erase. It hurts my head just to think about how many players need to be brought in over the next couple and how much of the current squad needs the boot.

It has become a popular buzzword but its actually very difficult to operate an economy if you start dividing everything into little pots with special rules on what they can, and cannot, be spent on. There is a great deal of misconception surrounding the idea of ring fencing budgets. It's rarely done and when the government use the term they usually mean it in the sense of something being ""protected from cuts"" rather than funds are literally set aside for a specific purpose. 

&gt; would it be better to use the money directly within the university instead of the NHS

Remember universities are NOT state controlled. Universities earn money from students and are partly subsidized by the state... money that universities make does not funnel into government coffers. So if University ""A"" takes on 1000 foreign students into the local community and makes £10,000 from each then University A makes £10,000,000. The only money the government receives is from tax against the university and its employees. So beyond what would be taxed anyway none of that money goes to the NHS. So the local hospitals end up picking up the pieces from 1000 new students without any of the financial rewards the university is receiving. 

This seems fair to me... individuals born in the UK (and perhaps to a slightly cloudier extent the EU) can be expected to have received a certain standard of healthcare. The whole point of vaccinating children with expensive drugs is to prevent costly complications of those diseases ranging from death to disability. Eradicating Polio means hospitals now don't have to have vast wings full expensive of ""[iron lungs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_pressure_ventilator)"" to help ventilate large numbers of children who will still then go on to develop other costly complications further down the line. Essentially our public health programmes are designed to keep people healthy and out of hospital so it saves money later on.

Children coming from asia and southeast asia have generally received healthcare that is not up to the same standard. I am somewhat sympathetic to those coming from the US and Australia/Japan etc. who get caught out by this but there are other legitimate reasons for levying it that justify the cost. At any rate, student immigration often means the NHS can be left picking up the pieces of diseases that never would have happened if they'd lived here from birth - and by extension their families had paid into the system. In a sense you could think of the £150-200 fee as a sort of *""Hey, I haven't paid anything in and you guys all have - so here's a little contribution from me for the privilege of coming here and receiving your awesome comprehensive healthcare""*.",null,1,null,1428340789,null,0,false,0,cq34a2h,null,t3_31msqt,null,t1_cq34a2h,null,t1_cq33ruu,null,null,null,1432228859,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I generally eat healthily, with notable exceptions. Most days I manage to get five portions of fruit and veg, tomatos, carrots, beetroots, apples, berries, etc, if not more. However I have a terrible sweet tooth that I try my best to control - this results in BIG 'cheat day' binges once (sometimes twice) a week on junk food and sugars that I know are not great. Outside of those binges, my diet is good and as I say I get the fruit and veg (mainly veg), as well as oily fish. Sometimes I have a Costa lunch (toastie plus a slice of cake and a diet coke) but not more than twice a week. Otherise I cook for myself, and have a large porridge with dried fruit,berries etc for breakfast, apple and veg for lunch.

 I am a healthy weight and am physically active.

You'll see there data from 7 of of the countries is from 2011. Before the Tory party made the NHS take a huge nose dive.

Here's a graph that illustrates the change quite well;

https://vine.co/v/OpBXAm0znx6

Released by the Labour party of course. But it's the best one I could find that illustrates the point.

Not to mention the data used in the report is highly subjective.

""It includes information from the most recent three Commonwealth Fund international surveys of patients and primary care physicians about medical practices and **views** of their countries’ health systems"" 

Where as the statistics for the outcomes(i.e stopping people from dying) were not subjective;

""U.K. had much higher death rates in 2007 from **conditions amenable to medical care** than some of the other countries, e.g., rates 25 percent to 50 percent higher than Australia and Sweden. Overall, France, Sweden, and Switzerland rank highest on healthy lives.""

It was also primarily made to support obamacare. So yes it's going to say state sponsored care is the best in the world. 

If you honestly believe not only do we have the cheapest healthcare system in the world while also failing in it's primary function(keeping people alive), while also having the best, fine. But there's probably absolutely no other service or business on the face of the earth where that is the case.

Here's a report from 2014 that ranks us middle of the scale out of 36 countries(page 10) which in my opinion is far more realistic(but doesn't give left wing nationalists an erection sadly);

This report is just used as a nationalistic dog whistle to bleat ""UK NUMBER 1 YEEEAAAAHHH"". Often so people can say Britain is better than America with smug superiority. It is the only one of it's kind where the NHS comes out top. And it was used to support the implementation of state health care in a different country. It's partisan.

&gt;To be a destroyer of worlds or a sage

'or a sage' there comes off as forced and throws the meter off. You could leave the 'a' off there and just have it read
&gt;To be a destroyer of worlds or sage

and have it mean the same. Every word in a poem is important and is meant to either convey emotion, paint a picture, or move it along. Also, punctuation is important as well! Often people assume they need to capitalize every line in every stanza and that's not necessarily the case. Your line:
&gt;But, sometimes life does not go the good way In the mid’st of other’s realization Cannot see that it’s their own judgement day Of the emotional regeneration But when he loves, his eyes are never dry Because she heard last was “Rose Tyler, I”

Comes across as one long run-on sentence and could benefit immensely from some punctuation:
&gt;But, sometimes life does not go the good way. In the mid’st of other’s realization, cannot see that it’s their own judgement day of the emotional regeneration. But when he loves, his eyes are never dry because she heard last was “Rose Tyler, I”.

It's easier to read/digest, etc... and helps convey where one thought begins and ends.

Another note on structure. ""There are fourteen lines in a Shakespearean sonnet. The first twelve lines are divided into three quatrains with four lines each. In the three quatrains the poet establishes a theme or problem and then resolves it in the final two lines, called the couplet. The rhyme scheme of the quatrains is abab cdcd efef. The couplet has the rhyme scheme gg.""

You come close throughout, but it get's off a bit in the middle. People/peaceful is what we call a false rhyme. It's close, but not a true rhyme per se. Realization/regeneration is closer still, but that's a half rhyme.

Overall, for a self proclaimed ""not a good writer"" it's a solid attempt. I'd love to see you revise this, and see how it turns out. A Shakespearean sonnet is a great vehicle for some of the themes of the Doctor, and can be quite entertaining. Feel free to PM me if you want advice or more resources. I used to write a _lot_ of poetry years ago and I am happy to help. Otherwise, I appreciate your effort and I encourage you to keep writing!

Somebody that has no other way of getting money, due to their circumstances, is something that's always going to be a part of society in urbanised areas. But begging whilst you have a at least partially sustainable life elsewhere, but you simply have no interest in working, is just deplorable. These people have no excuse for living the way they do. They're not begging out of need, if they were, they would start by selling the iPhone that I know is in their pockets, because I sold it to them. They just have no interest in working or doing anything but preying on the misplaced generosity of others. 
  
And as somebody else said, the absolute biggest issue as I see it, is it devalues and further hinders the legitimately homeless and needy in Edinburgh (or wherever). 

This post was mostly inspired by watching the homeless (apparent) ex serviceman outside my shop, arguing with one of said false beggars. The former, is genuinely homeless. Whatever else is or isn't true about him, he sleeps on the streets. He doesn't get dropped there in the morning. I know where he usually sleeps rough. He's often there when I get to work in the morning. And he's arguing with this guy because he left his spot for a few minutes to go for a piss or whatever, and the other boy has just shoved his stuff to the side, popped down his wee stool, and took over his spot. Which I presume due to its placement, is a good spot.
  
It's shit like that which is why it's so completely and absolutely repugnant. One person needs to beg, the other person chooses to beg. And they probably get about the same in donations every day. How is this in any way something that anybody with a shred of humanity can see and just be like ""eh, whatever"".

An instructor should never shout at you either. They can talk firmly, you can be scolded for mistakes, and so on, but to raise their voice? No. Just not on.

2. Arabic students constantly reading the paper before the exam begins, and continuing to write after it finishes.  The first part never seems to get caught, the second part is caught occasionally but I'm not totally sure how it's dealt with. Potentially scrapping the entire page they were working on?


The lecturers attempt to combat this however it's not foolproof.  Also this isn't me just targeting arabic students, they're literally the only one's I see doing it. The Chinese,  N/S Americans and Europeans seem to abide by the same rules as the rest of us.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"With retinol of that strength you MUST apply *and reapply* a broad spectrum sunscreen SPF 30+ every day because it is photosensitising (increases sun damage on exposure).

Even without that the official guidelines are sunscreen any day the UV index hits 3+ which is very regularly between April and October. A surprisingly high percentage of UV radiation penetrates cloud (&lt;90%) and shade (&lt;50%) and there is a higher percentage of UVA (ageing) than UVB (burning) early and late in the day when you might be commuting, also more UVA penetrates cloud and glass.

Vitamin C and retinol take months to really kick in. See the link I posted as to what subtle results can be expected after *two years* of ticking all the boxes. Her diet is super clean and she wears sunscreen year round. Those two actives plus niacinamide are the cosmetic actives with the best research backing them in anti ageing. They work synergistically so all three is better than one alone.

Conservative Botox should still allows some expression, and I agree - wax face is creepy or amusing but always distracting!! AFAIK some dermatologists want to give plenty of units of Botox to begin with so you see results and come back, others are happy to scale up slowly as long as you understand you might not see much initially. I suspect (hope) they would treat professional guy different than a 'lady who lunches'.
 
*At least* five a day meaning the bare minimum, most western countries advocate seven to nine in line with the published research. The antioxidants support sunscreen use for anti ageing.

For the moment I don't mind moving Willian central as long as we had a credible player to give us actual width and sit on the touchline. As it is, we don't. Cuadrado might eventually look decent if we drop Oscar for a bit though.

Must admit I expect Fabregas to end up in Oscar's position more often if we actually get another credible CM.

I guess it's just a feeling, but I thought that Poch was lukewarm on Harry Kane. He gave Adebayor a lot of time to secure the job. He gave Soldado a lot of time to secure the job. When Harry started off hot I recall Poch saying something to the effect that Soldado/Adebayor were still the starters. It felt like Harry had to play exceptionally well to earn the job. I'll give Poch some credit for Harry's development, but it's hard to say how much or how little of that to put on him.",null,0,null,1428342763,null,0,false,0,cq35jmz,null,t3_31ks5s,null,t1_cq35jmz,null,t1_cq343g5,null,null,null,1432229456,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

I'd contest your assumption that protests 'often turn violent'. The frequency of violence at protests is grossly exaggerated  by the media, and I think that's done to sensationalize, and possibly also out of a wider establishment agenda of criminalizing public demonstration and delegitimizing it in the eyes of the public.

If a fight were to break out at a music concert, and the people involved were rightly removed by security and arrested by the police, then you wouldn't say that the concert 'turned violent'. If you were at that concert you probably wouldn't even know that it had happened. Even if a fight like that broke out at every single concert, you wouldn't say that concerts should be banned because 'they usually turn violent'. And if gig security pushed Metallica fans around like police push demonstrators, there would be a lot more scuffles and altercations. The same could be said of football matches or any other public event.

And while violence is indefensible, clashes do happen. But that's not why (99% of) people are there. Passions run high, especially amongst highly engaged young people, but only because the perceived stakes are so high.

I think that the freedom to participate in public political action is important and worth defending. I think that what happens out there on the street is crucial to democracy. I even respect the rights of the fascists to be there, because everyone has the right to stand up and make an argument about how they want society to be run. 

&gt; Do you think large counter protests, which often turn violent, are helpful in combating fascism?

Yes I do. Far Right political parties and fascist organizations have been on the rise across Europe since the 1990s, and have gained  footholds in places like Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, The Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries.

In the UK there is very little political representation for fascist and racist ideologies. This is despite the fact that minority parties like the National Front and the BNP have a long history here. At the same time organizations like Britain First and the EDL have a huge amount of public support, and we know that the percentage of voters in the UK with [fascist sympathies](https://dystopiasm.wordpress.com/2014/10/17/the-return-of-fascism/) or [self-avowed racist views](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27599401) is easily comparable to countries like [France](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7786349/French-admit-they-are-racist.html) where the far right have made huge strides in recent elections.

So what I'm getting to is: what's the difference between a country like ours, where fascism has consistently failed to take root, and other European countries where fascist political parties are already in seats of power?

Wouldn't you agree that strident public opposition to fascism is surely a big factor in this?

You should consider the sheer numbers of people in the UK who are self-avowed racists or have [voted for fascist parties in the past](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_Party_election_results). As Ernest Hemingway said ""There are many who do not know they are fascists but will find it out when the time comes.""

When organizations like Pediga hold rallies like these, the goal is to speak to these disaffected voters. They say ""You are being denied political representation because your racist views are not seen as legitimate - but together we can have legitimacy, and you won't need to be afraid to say what you think any more. We're thinking what you're thinking - maybe millions more are too. ""

The rallies may be small at first, but that's exactly how racism spreads into politics and fascism takes hold in a country. 

And I think the best thing we can do to undermine the fascists is to hold counter rallies. The counter rallies also speak to the potential fascist recruit, they say: ""it's true there might be millions of you, but we have millions more. We are the mainstream, and we will defend our society. We will always oppose you: not because of our affiliations, but because of our values and convictions.""

If such demonstrations were all-out bloody brawls where each side tried to prevent each other from holding a rally, I could see where you were coming from.

This is something that has bothered me for a while. I feel like everyone is being lied to. The Conservatives aren't mentioning that this isn't some tough choice for them, reducing the services offered by the government is fine by them. 

It's too late now though, the narrative has been decided. The media decided the global financial crisis was New Labour's fault and that we need to learn from their mistakes. We've all apparently decided deficit reduction is really important, public spending is too high and the only way to avoid it all again is to cut public services.

null,false,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,null,"The games where Mikel is effective rely on him being essentially an extra man.

He's an admission that you're only countering the other team and he's more or less stagnant. His purpose is to occupy the space between the midfield and the defence that the opposition would also try and flit between (in a simplistic view). Mikel is just there to stop that ball coming through and put pressure on the player more immediately. He doesn't so much break up the play proactively as block play from really happening. It stops teams playing through us and that's why he was so vital in the CL win and also why he has been important to us when we sit back to soak up pressure.

On occasions where Mikel isn't the extra man he never looks capable. I insist that if that's the only time Mikel is useful, he really isn't that useful to our team. Anyone such as Zouma should be capable of doing that job well enough if we have a gameplan that needs it. 

Mobility wise Mikel should actually be quality. He's a large unit and if he actually sprints he's quick. The main thing is that I have more or less never seen him sprint. It's clear that 90% he's thinking where he needs to be or simply not thinking. He is not a smart footballer and never looks it. He isn't naturally a defensive mid and hasn't really managed to learn how to play there despite the extensive years he's played there since he joined us. I put that all down to Mikel simply not being good enough I'm afraid. There can't be many other excuses as to why he's positionally terrible, can't read the game as well and can never be used in a two despite having worked with some of the best coaches in the world. He has to have worked on things. There are random bits of progress under Jose and a few other coaches. Equally the same can be said of Ramires who is lacking in a lot of aspects. But Ramires shows vague progress of trying to correct that when he actually learns where to look for ahead of time in the few occassions he played centrally this season.

I have no doubt he works hard, but I honestly don't think he makes the grade whatsoever. ",null,0,null,1428343425,null,0,false,0,cq35z35,null,t3_31mp6u,null,t1_cq35z35,null,t1_cq33ft4,null,null,null,1432229727,null,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1,null

While I was a fan of players from Chelsea during the late 90s/early 00s like Zola, Jimmy Hasselbaink, and di Matteo (who I always liked as Chelsea's manager during his unfairly short stint there), I must admit that I didn't become a ""fan"" of Chelsea until Mourinho became manager. When he left I followed him and paid attention to his work at Inter and then at Real (which I don't care for as a club, but I love learning from Mourinho's tactics and psychology of the game so I watched).

I've watched almost everything Chelsea has done this year (it's really the only appointment TV I have).

We haven't really created much offensive chances, but rather got lucky wit howlers. This formation has sucked for a month. I don't have anything against Rodgers (love the guy actually), and I understand he's needed to do what he can to right a sinking ship, but I think this 343 thing is done. We need to adapt imo.

We signed 10 players last summer, and out best option for most of this season has been Raheem Sterling. Our best CB pairing involves someone bought to play as a CM, our most experienced CB who has been at the club for years and a CB we signed last season. 

We should have, after spending 100 million, plenty of options and Rodgers should not have to constantly change his formation in order to suit the teams strengths. Jose Mourinho plays almost the same formation and the same line-up almost every game, and maybe takes out one or two of them (Willian for Cuadrado, Fabregas for Mikel, Remy for Costa, Zouma for Cahill etc). Ferguson always used to play the same variant of a formation, but used to rotate players through injury or fatigue. 

Notice that whenever something was going wrong with the formation, both managers were able to implement some sort of change in order to change the game. As much as I despise Mourinho, if his first half doesn't go well his team comes out of the second half completely transformed. Be it a player, tactical or formation change. Rodgers lacks this tactical advantage that only top, top managers have. 

There are not many managers that constantly tinker with formations, there are many that use variations of the same one, but not those who constantly change it up, which Rodgers quite often does.

I know that 2007 was 'pre-crisis' and if the government were saying 'everything is great, we are fine and everything is fixed now' then you could make that comparison. But they are not, they are saying they have made headway but they still feel they have a long way to go. So in my opinion it is a completely false comparison to make.

Take Balo.  Here's a striker who has played and won at the highest levels.  Scored for his country to take them to the Euro finals.  Played for one of the best teams of the last decade (Mourinho's Inter).  Won titles and trophies, in Italy AND England.  

And Rodgers tries to make him play like Suarez.  Wants him to make runs (when it's obviously not his game).  Wants him to play as a lone striker when the rest of the team doesn't seem to know how to move upfield.  

The whole reason Balo is a good asset is because he has hold up play.  He has one of the best shots in the world, and is phenomenal on set pieces.  He can hold possession in the final third better than anyone.  Instead he's stuck making runs that lead nowhere (especially since the passing skill just isn't there, and some players seem to lose possession if the wind blows the wrong way), defending corners and generally wasting his time.  

How about all the transfers that barely play?  Lallana, Lambert, Balo, Lovren, Manquillo.  

How about Emre Can?  Shows promise early as a midfielder, scores a screamer against Chelsea, gets relegated to playing defence.  

If football were a competition to see which team can run the longest distance, Rodgers' team would win.  He seems to value running around in circles above any sort of measure of skill.

I'd call the freedom not to give a damn about politics a *victory* for society. 

If society is in a state where things are bad enough for everyone to need to care about politics, that's not a desirable situation. Things are, by and large, ticking along at a pretty reasonable level- and have been for decades. I'm hardly surprised that voter apathy's been on the rise.

&gt; why is people feeling like they can't endorse the system particularly relevant to the wider picture?

Because people shouldn't be forced to endorse a system that they disagree with. A fair spectrum of anarchists/communists across the country are of the view, for example, that electoral politics is fundamentally illegitimate, and voting is a bad thing to encourage. 

Why should they be *forced* to vote? Why should they be marched at gunpoint (or, if you prefer, threat-of-financial-penalties-point) to the ballot box?

I also had devineman making excuse after excuse on behalf of the club, towing the party line and attempting to shut down the debate entirely.

No-one is signing along with their fingers in their ears now.

The plastics don't give a shit of course, but now even the minority of long standing blues who deluded themselves about the trend re prices are finally starting to wake up and smell the coffee.

Too late now though, this is like a gargantuan ocean liner, the momentum is going one way. Very hard to turn that 180 degrees now.

What we'll see over the coming years is a growing number of long standing fans priced out, disillusioned with City's clear contempt for their loyalty, and they'll stop attending. The £1750 seats with be dotted with empty seats in your average league fixture, and the resentment among the fans will grow.

The atmosphere will continue to suffer.

Prices will continue to increase and our match going fanbase will be irreversibly gentrified and purged of the fans that kept this club alive back when the bandwagon plastics didn't give a shit about us, or weren't even born.

What? I wan't aware hung parliament was an option on the ballot paper.

I understand it's problems and this election will air them publicly for perhaps the first time.  

&gt;b) the irony that Scotland's votes in a GE force other people to unfortunately endure a government that the ""majority didn't vote for"" is delicious.

I don't see how it is at all, it's a huge failure of our system and one which will further divide the UK in the publics mind. Still we can hope that the SNP aren't needed and such a potential crisis can be avoided.

But, he's also gotten incredibly inconsistent results from players who were supposed to be playing better- McCarthy, Barkley, Barry, Lukaku, etc.  It's hard for me to completely pin this on Martinez when so much of the squad has underperformed.  You base your game plan around the players you expect to perform, and when they don't (and a bunch get injured) a plan B is pretty hard to come by.

I think it's less a stubbornness with tactics and more a stubbornness to play the same players over and over - but with all the injuries, I think sometimes he had no other choice.  Still, I hope this year is a big learning moment for him and he gets rid of the people dragging the team down, while using the beginning of the new season to experiment more to determine the right mix and approach for the rest of the season.

In the 2010 Election the Green Party received 1.0% of the popular vote and won 1 seat in the House of Commons. In 2015 the forecast is that they will receive 5.0% of the vote and win 1 seat. The next Parliament is going to be less representative of this minor party, despite thier [surge](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/15/green-party-membership-surge-leaders-debates) in party membership.

Maybe you choose to ignore that though, it's just one fringe party. Consider this though, the consensus is that the SNP will be deciders of the the next Prime Minister, but they can only do this because they are massively over represented. In 2010 the SNP received 1.7% of the vote and won 6 seats; in 2015 the SNP are expected to reveive 3.7% of the vote and win 48 seats. 

Let me get that clear, the Green Party could get 5% of the vote and 1 seat, and the SNP could get 3.8% of the vote and 48 seats. 

Taking this even further, in 2010 UKIP got 3.2% of the vote and no seats. In 2015 they are forecast for 13.9% of the vote and 2 seats. Compare this with the Lib Dems who are expected to get 9.5% of the vote and 17 seats. The source I used is [this](http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/homepage.html), but other election forecasts are predicting the same kind of results.

With all this in mind it's not difficult to see why this election is problematic, some minor parties will be ignored almost completely while others will have the power to decide the fate of the country for the next 5 years.",null,0,null,1428346541,null,0,1428357723,0,cq38096,null,t3_31n92h,null,t1_cq38096,null,t1_cq35qhl,null,null,null,1432230685,null,70,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,70,null

Roma people have a single word for working, and don't really distinguish between begging, selling flowers, busking etc. This is because historically Roma people were kept as slaves in parts of Europe at points, but instead of being fed they had 2 days off a week to go and earn money by whatever means they could come up with to feed themselves and their family. Not sure about other parts of Europe but I know that in Romania the Roma folk are treated really badly and I think couldn't even be citizens until 25 years ago.

There is a big call to reintroduce them because of the deer problem. People get attack by stags constantly, tree's are being destroyed and they are killing sheep. Worst still the population of deer has exploded causing them to start spreading further out.

Many institutions have called for the reintroduction of wolves into the highlands of the UK. They live in close proximity to people on the continent with out to many problems. 

Stags do regularly attack and kill people to the point it doesn't make TV news.

null,false,Dardanator,null,null,null,"I'm in two minds. Fundamentally I disagree with their desire to break up the United Kingdom; I think they haven't made the case for why independence (and nothing short of it) is necessary, and I think there are better options that would benefit all of the UK rather than a radical option that would only benefit Scotland and potentially be to everyone else's detriment. However, the events of the past few years and particularly the growth of the SNP since the referendum have only further convinced me that independence is unnecessary; a number of arguments for it relating to democracy/representation are looking more and more untrue. Based on that part of me doesn't want to see them win loads of seats. But on the other hand, I see ordinary people, even people younger than me engaging in politics and wrestling control away from out of touch political parties who have abused the public for too long, and I don't know how I could justify being opposed to that.

What I want to see is political change and competent governance. For years this has been discouraged because we've been locked into a two party system support by loyal media, with the big two now existing purely to oppose each other. However change has never been impossible, we as the voting public have always had the ability to vote for different parties, to influence the existing parties by engaging with the political parties and standing as candidates, or even by starting new parties. Individual people have little power and therefore we've always thought it was unsafe to try anything more radical than tactically voting to keep the party you dislike the most out of power. However the changing political landscape in Scotland demonstrates just what is possible when the public take an interest in politics, pursue the change they wish to see and work together to achieve it. The whole country is crying out for political change and I think Nicola's approval ratings in the debates demonstrate this. The only main difference between Scotland and the rest of the UK is that they've had an avenue to express that desire by voting for an alternative party. I don't think there are any parties in the rest of the UK similar to the SNP.

So my thoughts on an SNP influence on the British government depend on what they do with it. I think they have the potential to influence positive change in the UK and can be the spark for a wider political revolution. The current political establishment is crumbling and I think it's only a matter of time before such a revolution happens, but its a lot more certain to happen if the SNP work with other parties across the UK and demonstrate what alternatives are possible. If they use their influence to exacerbate hostility between Westminster and Scotland so they can push the issue of independence and perhaps achieve it within five years then I think it will be a massively wasted opportunity, and I fear it will be a split on very bad terms leaving a rift that will take long to heal. On the other hand, if they put the issue of independence off the table for the next five years and work with other parties to push aggressively for reform across the whole uk, a lot of good will come from their presence in parliament. The problem is they've been sending a lot of mixed messages, Nicola seems to be saying a lot of things suggesting her aim is the latter but others in the party keep talking about possible referenda in the near future. I think that if they do want to participate in the government of the UK and push for reform then they will need to explicitly say that independence is off the table for now and they will work for the benefit of the whole UK so that people outside Scotland will feel more conformable with them taking a role and therefore other parties won't put themselves at risk by collaborating with them.

null,false,jesst,english,London,null,"Exactly this. I don't have to pay as I'm now a permanent resident and qualify for my citizenship in January, but hear me out.

I work. I pay NI out of my paycheck just like every other person. Before my permanent residency I was not allowed to apply for any benefits outside of the NHS, but I paid taxes the same as everyone else. 

I fall under the old visa laws, so my visa wait period was only 3.5 years from entrance to citizenship. I've had to apply for 3 separate visas. Which cost about £1000 each. My citizenship will cost another £1000. 

People on the new visa laws sometimes have a much longer period either 7 or 10 years depending on your income. It's still the same number of visas and the same cost for visas, except now you add on £200 a year. If you're on the 10 year track you're looking at a £3000 visa cost (£2000 for the NHS + £1000 to the UKBA). That's if you mail your visa in by the way, if you need to travel anytime in the 6 months from your visa application to when your visa will potentially be approved you may have to pay an extra almost £300 for your visa to be processed faster. If you're on the 10 year track it's very likely that you're working, the income requirements are set low and over the course of that 10 year period you don't qualify for any kind of benefits so if you aren't working you are probably starving. 

Oh, by the way, if my husband were French instead of British, do you know how much all of this would cost? Almost nothing. I would still be able to settle here based on his EU status, only I would pay the costs of a French visas which are considerably cheaper and I wouldn't have to pay for the NHS. Also, I'd qualify to be able to go back to school for reduced tuition rates (which has been a bit of a sore spot for my husband and I as I have had to wait until I received my permanent residency to qualify for the non-international student rates). 

We made this decision and when we chose to live here instead of America we knew what we were in for, just like most of the people applying for this visa should do. However, they're going to end up punishing their own citizens. My husband and I chose to settle here as his family is a lot older then mine (my in laws are about 10 years older then my parents and aren't healthy), if we were looking at these same figures when we made our decision we would have probably decided to stay in America. Which would have affected his family and his qualify of life. It wouldn't have had an impact on me. I have the same job with the same company as I did in America. I see my family about twice a year, which is frankly almost as much as I saw my family when I was in America as we didn't live in the same place.

&gt;

&gt;__Hawkesbury Junction__ or __Sutton Stop__ ([grid reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_national_grid_reference_system) SP360846) is a [canal junction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junction_(canal\)) at the northern limit of the [Oxford Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Canal) where it meets the [Coventry Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_Canal), near [Hawkesbury Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkesbury_Village), [Warwickshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwickshire), on the [West Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county\)) county border, [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England). The alternative name, Sutton Stop, arises from the name of a family which provided several lock keepers there in the nineteenth century.

I think Markovic and Can are two excellent buys that can truly be great in the future, I just don't think the youth are being bought for the right reasons. 

Last season we were accustomed to seeing the classic 4-4-2 diamond formation. It makes sense to buy Markovic if Rodgers planned on playing a 4-3-3, but we barely even saw the 4-3-3 being played this season. Now when we play 3-4-3 Markovic either players as an attacking midfielder or a wing back, neither are positions that he played at Benfica (I may be wrong about the attacking midfielder part, but to my knowledge he mostly played on the wing).

Then on the striker situation, if Rodgers DID plan to play a 4-3-3, then with Sturridge injured ideally we should play Balotelli, if not him then Lambert, if NOT him then Borini? Neither of which are played. Sturridge and Balotelli have really only properly played together against Spurs (in which we won 3-0), and I don't think we've seen any other striker combination as it is. 

I don't believe that we don't have depth, we have plenty of depth, but what the club needs to focus on is getting quality IN depth, and have a clear idea of what the manager is looking for. Brendan should not have to tinker with the formation out of need if we are buying 10 players in one transfer window, let alone take 3 months to find the right formation.

&gt; Sadly, none of those things have happened.


That's absurd to expect that in his first season... You must not have been following football long at all. 

Also this team clearly plays a Pochetinno style of football, there's just loads of shit players. 


&gt;We're arguably playing as badly now as we did at the start of the campaign.

This is such a kneejerk reaction to the most recent game, you must have a short memory. 

&gt;None of Poch's signings other than Dier have worked out

He spent next to nothing and half the players he bought are for the future. 


&gt;Honestly, I would not be surprised to see us lose two of Lloris, Vert and Eriksen in the summer (not Kane... still too young and obviously loves the club), because arguably all three should be playing Champions League football by now

They're all good players but not superstars, the only one that could leave for a better club would probably be Lloris, but maybe not because De Gea is in higher demand.

Some of the moaning is just overboard, and expectations are a bit unrealistic. I just think the view of Liverpool as a club has been distorted. We are a sleeping giant in every sense of the phrase, and we were asleep for a while before last year's wonder season. 

Before last year, 2008/09 was the last time we were legitimately competitive at the top of the league. For four years, we produced mediocrity then we had one great season out of nowhere. I think when we saw FSG come in, BR come in, we knew it was going to take time. Now the owners have erased the debt that was built up, plans for expansion have come to life, and we've built a squad that has a lot of potential. Liverpool is a club that **don't** buy marquee players, Glen Johnson was the last one that comes remotely close to that. Alonso, Mascherano, Torres, Suarez, Owen, etc all built their names at Anfield. So no we're not getting the Lacazettes of the footballing world. 

We have to settle for scraps if we're being honest and despite that, we've built a squad filled with potential, competing with the likes of Chelsea, City, United who are ridiculously blessed when it comes to the transfer market. They can literally get any player they wish so long as Barca/Real/Bayern aren't in for them. So of course our transfer record is hit or miss, we're often settling on players. We don't have the luxury to have multiple elite options presented to us. 

It's as if we forgot how the team performed against Chelsea when Studge was out on two legs. It's as if we've forgotten a lot of things honestly. We aspire to be great, but we have to be patient. 2 back to back losses to United/Arsenal are tough regardless of where we are in the table but I want to see more people acknowledge where we've come from, the progress and what we're building.

null,false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"It depends what you mean by work with the Labour party doesn't it? Voting though their Queen's Speech and voting down motions of no confidence doesn't leave Miliband with much power. Labour will probably want some some agreement on a legislative program with the SNP in ensure a relatively stable Government. The SNP demand a few things, Labour ask for their votes to get some of *their* things though and we have a Government and importantly some stability. 

However if the SNP will not agree to anything other than the Queen's Speech and say they'll then vote on a issue by issue basis we have a problem. Labour will be beholden entirely to the SNP, if we assume the Conservatives vote *everything* down, and as a result we could get utter gridlock. Labour could struggle to pass a budget if there is no ability to compromise over what goes into it.  Labour can no longer call a General Election because of the fixed term Parliament act and so they would need a vote of no confidence to be held. Of course the Conservatives may go for this along with Labour votes but the SNP will vote against. Then we're either stuck with a Government that can't do anything or another General Election which will allow the SNP to say Labour are letting in a Conservative Government.

It's easy to see how chaotic this situation would be. 

&gt; Does that not say the only way to get the government you keep voting for is to vote for independence?

Which is exactly why the SNP would be happy to see the above play out. Offer Labour a poisoned chalice. They either form a Government unable to work effectively (and destroy them for the next election down south) or reject it and slam them for letting the Tories back in. 

Why do you think trident is a 'red-line' in any formal agreement? Because it gives the SNP an 'out'. A reason they can sell to their electorate as to why there cannot be a formal agreement. 

An agreement to vote down a Tory Queen Speech and install Miliband in No 10 is meaningless unless it accompanies an agreement that allows Labour, in association with the SNP, to be able to pass bills and a budget.

Cover for midfield. Either promote a youth player or someone who can combine a little bit of Fabregas and Ramires.

I've been so sure of our defense this season (especially since the new year) but today they were just all over the place.  Hopefully it's just down to Ikeme coming back from injury and they're just having to settle back into it.  Going forward though, I can't remember the last time I saw our attack so lethal on all fronts (bet Sako is glad we didn't let him go to Forest now...).

Even though Dicko's second goal was great, he had so much time in the area, was a strange choice to take the shot from there (glad he did though).  I've always rated 'Dangerous' Dave Edwards, he's not the most attractive player (though he is a looker) but his workrate is top notch and like today, he's coming up with some important goals.  He's like a poor man's Teddy Sheringham, hope he stays in/around the team.

Leeds were so average, this scoreline flatters them immensely.  Their only chances came from our mistakes and they took them, we just managed to carry on and get that winner.

No doubt there was going to be fighting somewhere in the city tonight but after a finish like that, the police are going to have their hands full.

Yeah, this too. The reason you have a King and a Queen is that a King (just - they're the same level title but a male outranks a female of the same ""level"") outranks a Queen. You can't have a King if the Queen is the monarch because no title can outrank the monarch.

In a hypothetical gay couple on the throne, the partner of the man who inherited the throne would be prince consort.

Brits generally don't give a fuck where people are from. I certainly don't and I've been following the club for some time. What a lot of people _do care_ about is the nature of the support. Demonstrably, there are a lot of people - UK and overseas - who claim to support the club but can't even be bothered to learn some simple facts about the club yet get all hurt when they're pulled up on it. 

Your last remark could be perceived as pretty arrogant. Why should everyone be thankful for 'overseas love' when the biggest positive effect on the club is in revenue? What must UK-based fans be thankful for?

**Name of product:** Skinceuticals Ultra Facial Defense SPF 50+

**Price of product:** €30 for 30ml (I got a sample of 3ml)

**Where did you purchase:** Persona Med-Aesthetic Centre (Malta)

**Product claims:** *""High UVA/UVB broad-spectrum moisturising protection""*

*""Ultra Facial Defense SPF 50 protects skin from the range of UV rays known to cause premature skin ageing. Formulated with state-of-the-art UV filters, this high-protection sunscreen helps prevent UV induced collagen breakdown.""*

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** Please mind that my review is only on the feel, texture and application of one usage, since the sample I got is only enough for that many use.

It's a cream, but spreads and feels light like a lotion. It applies white at first, but quickly dissipates. Tackiness disappears after 10 minutes, but still shiny. Light dusting of loose powder (I used Ben Nye Banana Powder lightly dusted with MAC 187) on top takes away the shine and makes skin looks like having foundation on. There's a slight whitecast (face appears a tad paler) on my NC30-35 skin. I'm pretty sure it can be countered with a darker powder. I personally think it's a great makeup base. I experienced no itchiness and burning sensation, but a hive appeared. I would purchase a full bottle to see how it fares with my skin condition. It has several triggers for my SD, but I'm curious. Plus, it doesn't have Avobenzone and Octocrylene. Unfortunately, with the price, I don't think I will. :(

Rodgers is stubborn when he doesn't change things up but when he does something drastic which had an undoubtedly positive effect it's a bad thing? 

As for Balo can you blame Rodgers for not wanting to play him? Rodgers doesn't even want him to play. Balo has offered next to nothing. Lambert has has more of an impact. Balo doesn't even care about the club. He didn't touch the ball once on Basels box when we lost 1-0 to them ever since then Rodgers has rightly lost faith in him.

Firstly I apologise as on mobile.

To break it down for you, for the tax year just gone 5 April 2015, you'll earn 22k employed and your profits for the first year ending 30 June 2015 will be 32k. 

Breaking it down, personal allowance is 10,600 (off the top of my head) so income tax on your employment income will be 22,000-10,600=11,400 * 20% = 2,280, this is obviously done by PAYE. 

Your self employment is more complex, you are registered for self assessment and I hope you have registered and are paying class 2 nic? 

You will have to complete a tax return (due by 31 jan 16) which you detail all sources of income.

The tax system for first year of self employment is done on something called basis periods, so in year one I.e. 2014/15 you will be taxed on profits from commencement to 5/4/15. 

So from 1/7/14 (which is when I assume you started) you will have profits of 32k * 9/12 = 24k. This will be taxed:

20% :  20,600 (being 32k basic rate limit less (employment income less personal allowance) = 4,120

40% : remaining 3,400 = 1,360

Tax due is 5,480

Also liable for class 4 NICs on your SE income which will be @ 9% on the amount above primary limit (I think off top of my head is approx 8k) 24k-8k = 16k* 9% = 1,140

So balancing payment for 2014/15 due 31 jan 16 is gonna be 5480 + 1140 = 6,620

Now here's where tax gets fun mate. Basically as you have income not taxed at source ie SE income your 31/1/16 payment will also include a payment  on account for the next tax year. Which will be calculated at half current tax liability so 3310. SO your total tax payment on 32/1/16 will be 6620+3310 = 9930

BUT here is where tax is even more fun. There is something called NIC maxima, which you will hit. Essentially imagine all of your income was employment, you would pay 2% nic on the amount above a certain limit, as your income is split you are paying the relevant nics at the main rate of each type of income. By this I mean 9% class 4 on your SE and 12% class 1 primary on your employment income. So you should be able to write to HMRC and claim the overpayment back.

Any other questions or if I've missed anything let me know.

Cheers

EDIT: I just read the last bit of your post again so apologies.

If unionists really are serious about valuing the union above all else, they need to think seriously about federalism. And fast. And IMO, a federal system with one hugely dominant member (England as a whole) will not be a recipe for regional balance and harmony. England needs ideally to devolve power to regional assemblies (after all there are huge socio cultural divides within England too).

* ***I use sunscreen in dosage as recommended for advertised protection on the label. 1/4 tsp each for face and neck and about 2 tablespoons/1 shot glass for the whole body. Experience published is based on such usage.***

**Name of product:** Skinceuticals Mineral Radiance UV Defence SPF 50+

**Price of product:** €33 for 50ml (I got a sample of 3ml)

**Where did you purchase:** Persona Med-Aesthetic Centre (Malta)

**Product claims:** *""Broad-spectrum sunscreen fluid and enhance natural skin tone""*

*""This weightless fluid, with 100% mineral filters, provides broad-spectrum UV protection, whilst the formulation enhances skin's natural tone and boosts overall radiance.""*

**About you:** Combo-oily, sensitive (among others, my skin takes the habit of breaking out in hives when it doesn't like something I eat or put on my skin), SD/PD-prone. OSPW. Fitzpatrick IV. Freckles and PIH from hives.

**Your opinion:** Please mind that my review is only on the feel, texture and application of one usage, since the sample I got is only enough for that many use.

I got this as a sample that was only good for one usage. I wish I didn't try it at all.
Well, first it applied really nicely and dried velvety, although took a good 30-40 minutes to do so. Felt quite lightweight but you can still feel it on the skin. However, the color was totally off for my skintone. It has beige-y tone, which can still be manageable, but the shade was at least 2 shades darker than my skin. It made my skin looks like I'm wearing a white/grey mask, which is just as worse as a whitecast. The color is similar to that of Vichy Capital Soleil BB Cream. It may fit NC/W15-25 better.

What was worst is that immediately after application, my face felt warming up and it stung my skin, particularly so around the eyes. The stinging sensation didn't cease the whole time I was wearing it, I can still feel my face feeling warm.

P.S.: I put some of the excess on my hands and this sunscreen just sucked the life outta my hands. They feel so dry!

1. Dzeko looks awful and we need to off load him ASAP. He looked lethargic on the pitch (as usual) and when he was provided possession he has no idea what to do with it.

2. Navas is so painfully average. He did not have a single viable cross into the box. When he was provided possession he looked totally out of control. 

3. We can do nothing from set pieces. Corners do more bad than good for city. 

4. I'm on the fence with Yaya but I have a feeling that we need to dump him ASAP. he is 31 and looking worse every year. He had a great goal tonight, but he looked lost on the pitch the whole match.

* Manquillo loan - doesn't get games

So much money wasted on nothing. This is not a problem that's ""out of our hands"".

We say we have the best young squad in Europe but they won't win you titles without top players. Just look at Arsenal for the last 10 years. Also, that might be at risk because of Sterling situation. He's the biggest talent we've had since Owen/Gerrard and we might lose him at only 20 years of age, because we can't offer him CL or title challenge. It's not just about buying top talent, it's about keeping it as well and it seems like we could struggle in that area, especially if Sterling leaves. Hendo, Coutinho, Sturridge, Can etc. might be tempted to do the same in the coming years and then we're left with nothing and we'd have to rebuild yet again.

January was a waste, but huge mid-season moves are typically the calling card of clubs with either too much money or too much desperation to change course. We were neither at the time.

Ah, I see - sorry, [you're quite right](http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/snp-cuts-bursaries-for-poor-students-by-1-000-1-2563859). The college places is normally what people bring up, which seems a bit more defensible to me, but I don't know much about the bursary situation.

On the face of it it looks like a fall in grants was matched by raising the ceiling for loans?

&gt; I don't disagree with centralising the Police but I do disagree with some officers on the street now carrying guns.

I absolutely disagree with that policy too, however I think that's a situation that's showed up the advantages of having a single police force.

Prior to Police Scotland that system was already up and running. Strathclyde, Tayside and Northern [all armed their officers](http://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/police-scotland/armed-policing/armed-policing-in-scotland) in exactly the same way that Police Scotland is doing. Very few people knew about it (I certainly didn't), and even fewer had the ability to disagree.

If you did disagree, tough, the answer was just ""well, that's how we're doing things in our force"".

Making that policy available across Scotland has brought it into the spotlight. The Chief Constable now has to defend that decision to the public, to the Police Authority, and to Holyrood.

IMO this means the police in Scotland are now much more accountable than they were in the past. If the public decide that armed police isn't something they want in Scotland - in any force - then that policy is going to have to change.",null,0,null,1428354633,null,0,false,0,cq3difa,null,t3_31ng2u,null,t1_cq3difa,null,t1_cq3c997,null,null,null,1432233280,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; Yes but as soon as Miliband is installed as PM through winning confidence motion, Labour can start working on bills that the SNP would find politically impossible to turn down?

There will be bills however that Labour want for their English base which may be less pliable with the SNP. The SNP, eyes on Holyrood, would turn them down. Essentially it would mean only the bills with which the SNP and Labour both agree with would pass. It sounds fair in principle but Labour have a bigger mandate than the SNP and I think English and Welsh voters would find such an arrangement untenable. Again, this suits the SNP's narrative that Independence is the only way forward. Again, it destroys Labour in 2020. 

No. Labour need to bring the SNP onboard in terms of a deal. If I was them, in the event the parliamentary arithmetic makes such a scenario possible, I would offer a hell of a good coalition offer. Protection for the Barnett formula, a vote on STV, a vote on reform the house of lords and further regional devolution. However these will be contingent on on a full coalition. 

Make them an offer they cannot refuse. Challenge them to enter what would then be the Westminster establishment. Make the offer pliable enough to Scotland that the SNP refusing it over trident would seem unreasonable. They agree to it and we get a stable Government, they don't then the SNP wouldn't be able to claim Scotland are being excluded or Westminster wouldn't do a deal. 

&gt; I think a Miliband government, even without SNP guarantee about budget could be perfectly stable: SNP can't vote down budget without 'letting' the Tories in, at best they can abstain; and then Labour can practice good old american pork barrel stuff to get enough Lib-Dems on side.

Yah they can. Because the Fixed Term Parliament act allows them to do so. That idiotic reform has left us with a situation where a Government can have no power. Not even enough power to call an election. The SNP could easily vote down a Budget (""not in the interests of Scotland"") and then point the finger of blame at Labour. 

&gt; I don't think they would be in too weak a position at all. In fact I think it would give Ed an excuse to go much further left than he thinks he can run this election on.

What happens if there is a bill popular in England but not Scotland? It's bound to happen. The Conservatives will be probing for division for the duration of the Parliament. 

A proper deal means a bit of give and take. Labour will do something the SNP want, the SNP would in return do something Labour want. If they can't agree that we're fucked.

I like and support Rodgers, but honestly: has he done anything that, say, Allardyce or Pulis could not have done? I really, trully want him to turn out to be a manger on the SAF/Murinho/Guardiola level, but whether he can get there is still an open question.

I agree, that it was a lot about personnel rather than tactics, but don't agree that he didn't have choices.  Robles should have been brought in for Howard earlier or at least should have stayed in the side.  Early on Baines wasn't having his best season and Garnett looked more than capable.  The repeated substitutions of Besic when Barry was clearly knackered are questionable. And finally, playing Barkley and Naismith on the wings game after game when they've both been shown to be ineffective is, for me, inexcusable. 

I also hope that this season will be a learning moment professionally and personally. He is a good young manager with a promising career ahead of him, but he has to stop being so stubborn and drop players who are out of form, play a balanced system that suits his players rather than trying to force them to play a style that doesn't suit them, and most importantly assess games honestly rather than constantly try to stay positive.",null,0,null,1428355871,null,0,false,0,cq3eci2,null,t3_31nd7i,null,t1_cq3eci2,null,t1_cq37wvd,null,null,null,1432233744,null,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2,null

I'm not really sure how to approach this. If the UK is meant to emulate other countries to satisfy people from those countries who wish to migrate here... then doesn't that rather undo the purpose of immigration. Without meaning to sound incredibly rude, if your own nations system is so much better, why not move back there and enjoy it. In the meantime we can continue with our centrally funded universal healthcare system. Those people who want to come here and enjoy it too can contribute the token amount the government have set out of just under £17 a month. Seems pretty reasonable to me.

*2012: Santi Cazorla

Arsenal never solved their problems in a single transfer window like Man City, United and Chelsea can/did.

At the same time, we consistently develop our younger players (as well as our current starting XI) and in a few years time we would be a force in European football again (might be a bit optimistic but who cares).

No, there's just a lot that I purposefully omitted as it could potentially come back to haunt me.  I was beat myself several times, but I turned from a chubby kid into a fitter adolescent (remember I said I was good at football and had a six-pack at one point?)

&gt;Hate to break it to you but your ""racism"" sounds like an easy life. 

You know nothing about me bar one post I made.  Speaks volumes on your part.

&gt;Did you know whites beat other whites on a regular basis? 

THEY DO?!  Fuck, this changes everything.  You'd think a boy who grew up in Belfast -- one of the only cities in the United Kingdom that is segregated on a sectarian basis -- would know a thing or two about white-on-white crime.  Boy, he might've even mentioned paramilitary groups in his original post.

&gt;This one time my friend got beaten by a group of darker coloured kids - but I figured this just happens to some unlucky people from time to time.

Well, you show some critical thinking skills there, congrats.  It's different when they chase you yelling racist expletives and shout them at you whilst beating you.  Becomes even more apparent (if beating and yelling racist words at you isn't enough, of course) when it happens over the course of years, umpteen times.  But... maybe I'm just 'unlucky'.

&gt;Honestly - you make out like you're such a victim, 

Yep, I was the perpetrator, ya caught me.  It was my fault that I wasn't born white in a socially turbulent time (seriously, do you know *anything* about Belfast?)  I instigated it all.

&gt;when in truth you never were physically pushed around at all. Boo hoo!

I've already addressed that I was.  I just didn't want to list every incident (nor cared to) because O.P. didn't ask for my life story, he/she just asked for my experiences, of which I gave an adequate flavouring.

&gt;Whoah turns out you're a nasty racist yourself. Explains the mentality a lot.

Nope, I was just an ignorant kid.  Stuff like that happens when you were raised in a city with a 90%+ white population and you come across your first black person.  

To conclude: I honestly couldn't give a shite what you think of me, I have enough going on in my life.  Whether you think I'm an attention seeker, or whether you're a troll, is irrelevant to me.  You don't know me, you've never met me, you know nothing of my life other than the few paragraphs up top and this comment here, so it would be unwise for you to judge me.

Have you considered that when faced with over 200,000 immigrants coming in per year (not even including almost the same number of ""students"" on top) and with little ability to control immigration from the EU, encouraging people from outside the EU not to migrate to the UK might actually be one intended purpose of this.... particularly given a pledge to cut the number of migrants to below 100,000.  

I appreciate it's harsh but nobody has an intrinsic right to settle in the UK.

I didn't use it as an excuse. I used his age as a reference point. Because age does matter. He has 5 years to hit his peak. That's important to remember. And did I say being young makes him better than older players that play better? Nope. Because Oscar has played well in the majority of his games at Chelsea. And he is among the best in the world at his position. 

&gt;&gt; And Rami isn't replacing Oscar when he plays in games that we need more defensive work. He plays where Fabregas plays. And of course Fabregas would move up and take Oscars spot. Because Fabregas is better than Oscar. I'm not sure how you think Rami replaces Oscar.

&gt;Holy shit. You actually thought that I meant Ramires plays as an attacking midfielder? Are you fucking with me. Of course he fucking switches with Cesc, I meant Oscar is replaced on the teamsheet.. I honestly cant tell if you are being dense or trying to deflect. The result is the same, Oscar is taken out of the team and Ramires is put in, there is a reason for this.

No. Didn't say you thought it. I simply pointed out how your point was invalid because you can relate Ramires going in and Oscar sitting the bench. It only shows Fabregas is better than Oscar. Because Rami is obviously a better defender than those two.

&gt;Hahahha, what a perfect example of backpedaling. **YOU** brought up this point, and **YOU** stated that he is in the top 10 best central attackers. Its not my job to prove your own damn claim. Go and list the names that you think he is amongst if you are so confident. I would bet my house that you are never going to type that out though, because everyone, even you, knows how absolutely ridiculous that is to say he is in the top 10 best attacking mids.

I didn't back pedal. I simply asked a question. You also made the claim he isn't.

The EU forced Scotland to do that. And we are obviously not going to make it free for England because then our universities would be flooded by thousands of English people. It would be unworkable. The process of abolishing fees actually began under the Lib-Lab government anyway.

None of the rest of your points amount to screwing rUK over, really. The idea that the SNP wants to do this or that it just hates England is pretty much a myth. If any party in Scotland wants to screw over England it's Scottish Labour, the party that votes on English issues, created the barnett forumula, boasts about it will fund the Scottish NHS with it's mansion tax and other dumb shit.

&gt; *No accountability to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland

I would argue most political parties are like that thanks to the wonderous system of FPTP. The conservative party, for example, has virtually no accountability to the people of Scotland and has a proud tradition of screwing over the industrial North of Britain in favour of the southeast.

I'd say 1/3 of the time we play: Hazard | Oscar | Willian/Juan as normal.

I've really enjoyed seeing Oscar play for Brazil, where he's on the left with Neymar.  Hazard's been really good as the number 10 as well (in fact, his best season at Lille was in this position).  With that in mind, we should experiment with (say, 1/6 of the time): Oscar | Hazard | Willian/Juan.  If it doesn't work, go back to the arrangement above.

Oscar needs rest, so 1/3 of the time: Hazard | Willian | Juan

Hazard isn't being given a break.  He's been visibly tiring this season and ideally we don't want a repeat of that.  So for the remaining 1/6 of the time, we should play Oscar | Willian | Juan which would obviously be our weakest formation.

The main problem with this arrangement is that all four AMs have a full time role.  If one of the four gets injured or suspended, we're stuffed.  I'm not sure Juan wants a full-time role yet, since he's still adapting to the game.  In addition, we don't want to be playing these arrangements against Watford or Strawberry.  With that in mind, we probably want another AM, which feels really weird to say after having Schurrle and Salah on the bench for so long.

I'm loathe to play Fabregas at #10 and the usual solution of 'shove Ramires/Remy in there somewhere' isn't sufficient.

That idiotic reform has left us with a situation where a Government can have no power. Not even enough power to call an election. The SNP could easily vote down a Budget (""not in the interests of Scotland"") and then point the finger of blame at Labour.

I thought a Budget counted as a no confidence vote?

But anyway I agree with you that Labour should offer the things you say; make the SNP an offer they cannot refuse. But I doubt Ed could drag his party to do that, I think the Blairites would sooner be out of power for 5 years than acquiesce to electoral reform.

The whole system relies on young and middle age healthy people paying way over the costs of their actual healthcare requirements, so old people and sick people can have it available for them, just like any other insurance works (without the profit), if loads of other people just come over without contributing then the systems breaks. 

You shouldn't just be able to turn up in a country and expect that country to pay your way, just like when pensioners from the UK move to Spain, their state pension isn't paid by Spain, it is paid by the UK, because they worked and paid tax in the UK their whole lives, not Spain. 

The same should be the case for benefits, the NHS, and any other reasonable services, if you come to the UK, the country you have come from should have to pay your benefits, healthcare (if they pay it in that country) and anything else. If you turn up here and your benefits from the country you came from don't cover your expenses and you can't get a job, then you shouldn't have come over here, I don't expect a free ride if I just go to another country and I would always have the option to go back to my original country, just like anyone else.  

All you do is put a limit on it, after 3-5 years of Full time or at least 50% part time working, you then get the same as anyone else in the UK, because you have contributed making up the deficit that you never paid when you lived somewhere else. I don't really think it is unreasonable to ask people emigrating here to have health insurance and expect them to get a job and pay their way if they want to get the same benefits as people who have paid into the system their whole lives.

null,false,Dardanator,null,null,null,"Depends on how well the tories do - if labour win either more seats or more votes then either way there is some argument to be made for a labour-government having greater legitimacy. If the conservatives have both more seats and more votes than labour then they will be seen as being the party that should lead the government and therefore blocking them from doing so will piss off conservative voters. That may be defended by arguing that parties represent ideas and the SNP-Labour combination totals to higher support for left-wing ideas than right wing ideas (tories, ukip, DUP, UUP), though that argument may not fly with the electorate. Ultimately though that would be what the system allows and I don't see the sense in appeasing an electorate who are angry because they don't understand the system.

That being said, I think the SNP's ""we won't do a deal with the tories no matter what"" stance is childish, as are all the other similar stances being expressed. Behind every party is a number of ordinary people who allow it to exist in parliament by voting for it, and behind every MP is a constituency whose entire population is represented in parliament by that MP, even those who didn't vote for them. Parties obviously can't do deals with each other when they have specific disagreements that they can't compromise on, but to flat out refuse to even discuss things with another party no matter what is divisive and pointless. It is not just a snub to that party but to all of the people who voted for it, meaning the issue is not just confined to parliament, and punishes people for having MPs who represent the wrong party even if they didn't want that MP.

Parties hold differing views because they represent different sections of the population whose own circumstances lead to different needs and beliefs. Usually none of the parties have all the answers or a complete grasp on how the country should be governed; nobody is right, they have different opinions, perspectives and priorities. Disagreement is healthy, it is no good having a parliament full of people who agree on everything because they might just be agreeing on some really bad ideas. Ideally the opposing parties should be engaging with each other, exploring the differences that prompt people to vote for the other party, taking the time to understand them and reaching a compromise that satisfies more people. Sometimes that might lead nowhere, such as if labour were discussing something with an extreme party like the BNP; nothing lost by trying, though. That's what the big parties should be doing to the SNP and other smaller parties, but there's no reason it shouldn't work the other way around as well. What reason will the conservatives have to soften their policies on austerity if parties like the SNP and greens still won't consider supporting them in return for fear of being crucified by their own supporters?

&gt;“A basic principle of science—of liberal social life—is that we kill our hypotheses rather than each other. Propositions are punished instead of their proponents. True, we often fail to live up to the principle despite our best efforts; that is inevitable. But the point is to try to distinguish the thought from the thinker. Karl Popper has pointed out that the critical method “consists in letting our hypotheses die in our stead.”

For our daughter we just wanted a 100% equity portfolio for the initial £4k we gifted her. Hargreaves Lansdowne don't offer the full range of Vanguard equity funds (they don't offer the US equity fund, for example) so it's harder to build a balanced portfolio, you have to use combinations of ETFs and funds and for a 'set and forget' portfolio like this one I didn't want the hassle of rebalancing. We aren't going to be able to put in £4k pa to this fund, based on our current plans, so this is a nest egg we can top up from time to time without doing annual rebalances. The minor extra fees Vanguard charge for the LS funds are worth it given these goals, in my view.

For us, we are currently expats in a zero income tax jurisdiction, so our tax affairs and the amounts involved make it a different set of considerations. We have an offshore brokerage account through TD and had to build our portfolio from Vanguard ETFs rather than funds. As we will regularly contribute to this portfolio, for the rest of our working lives, we can easily rebalance as we go so the lower fees become the priority. I'm not even sure the full range of Vanguard LS funds were available through the TD account anyway.

Now of course this is hyperbole, but there is no reason people emigrating to the UK shouldn't pay an extra 5% (or whatever number) national insurance add on first the 5 years (or whatever number) of their residency to make up for their lack of payment, or their lack of payment by their parents (because their parents didn't live in the UK), to cover and sustain the NHS's functionality.

I think his defending needs to be improved, particularly his positioning if he is going to be a part of a centreback partnership. But again, this may come with time, and he has several other qualities, like being a good passer, good in the air and a vocal leader that could be very useful for us, if he improves some of the weak parts of his game.

I was in the chippy on Montgomery street about 10 years ago and someone came in with a bag of cash the size of a melon that he converted to notes.. I think it was aobut 150 quid but obviously this is going back a bit.. when I spoke to the chippy he told me ""that was nothing, he came in here with 600 quid after a saturday night before""

that was the unpleasant guy that used to sit at the top of Broughton Street on the corner with Picardy place - next to the cash machine. Chippy told me they share the spot and they have a flat and they use the money for heroin.. Another friend told me she say the same guy in one of the fancy bars on George street wearing a suit. She was confused where she recognised him from until it dawned on her that this was the prick that always gives you lip if you walk past him without giving money.

I reckon the best way to do something about this is to contact the council and ask them to take action.. Other cities must have found methods of dealing with this. 

Putting up fixed signs telling people to give to homeless charities instead of to pan handlers would be a very good thing. signs on the trains and buses, on the lamp posts.

The NHS works by people who aren't using it paying in a lot of money, these people are 18-60 year old working age people, paying in thousands a year and only taking out hundreds, if that, they then are supposed to have added enough to the system that when they get to old age and actually need the healthcare system it balances out at a breakeven point. Of course currently the ageing population has meant this isn't occurring, the old people didn't pay enough in when they were working and are now living too long often with debilitating medical conditions that cost a lot and taking too much out, that is why the system has become unsustainable. But their is nothing politicians can do about that end result as old people vote, so you have to screw over the people that never caused the problem, because they vote less, even if they were never the cause in the first place. 

What will make it worse is having young and middle age immigrants coming in and using it, or even not using it, and then having access to it, as they haven't paid enough in to reach a breakeven point. Coming over to the UK and starting to pay, shouldn't get you access to the NHS, the NHS is sustained by people paying for years, decades, and not getting their monies worth out of it, so when they actually need it they can. It is a statistical system that requires X number of people to pay in X amount of money for X number of years. When immigrants come in, say at age 25 and lets say the average person in the UK starts paying in at 20, the immigrant is now X-5 in number of years paying into the system, for it to be sustainable (assuming they stay in the UK), they need to make up that -5. Or more realistically when you take a statistical representation of immigrants including the amount of tax they pay, their usage of the NHS, how long they say in Britain, how many stay permanently, you average that all out until you get a number of extra pounds that on average an immigrant to the UK has to pay to make immigrants use of the NHS at worst breakeven in cost, and realistically, not even breakeven, as with the ageing population, just like every citizen of Britain is having to sustain the NHS above their own costs or what their future costs will be, so should immigrants.

Currently British citizens are paying more into the NHS than they are going to get out, because old people didn't pay in enough to sustain themselves for as long as they are living.

He has had some less then spectacular moments, but he is consistently in the lineup (rarley injured) which is key and in my opinion is very well rated and as good a CB as anyone else in the EPL. Doesn't have the flair that some CB's have but solid would be a good word to describe him.

I agree with Terry leaving (in a year presumably) we need a CB but I am not sure it is the key position to address this summer. I think in the 4-2-3-1 formation we play we need to add to the 3 ""attacking midfielders"". I really like Oscar and Willian but there is no denying we have needed a little more from them in the 2nd half of this season (maybe fatigue has played a factor?) Cuadrado has yet to show his form, but Hazard is the best player in the world (maybe a little bit of a reach) so were still strong in the midfield. I think Cesc and Matic are deadly together and I like Rami and Mikel as backups (an upgrade here would be great - but hard to convince star players to sit most games). Costa and Remy are as good up top as anyone else but a 3rd Striker is needed (Drogba based god is ready to ascend to the heavens). At goalie we could use a backup assuming Cech walks. I think our outside backs could be addressed as well. I love Iva and Dave, and I think that Luis is very good (as a backup) but would not mind another player coming in to compete.

Back to the topic, imagine, for a second, what happens to the debate when someone has been reported to the secret police. And they are secret. These reports are made in secret and even their existence is secret. But as you know, there aren't really any secrets, so people find out. What are they going to do then? Are they going to go back to have the debate.

No. The debate will be completely closed down.

Imagine, these are people who have freely shared their youthful and heartfelt ideas and beliefs within an institution that is supposed to nurture them, by answering questions in the spirit of debate. Then the open and free principle under which the believed they were exchanging ideas has been betrayed, and, for whatever reason, not always a noble one necessarily, they have been handed over as a danger to society.

Do you really think they'll be back for more debating?

It all seems so easy. Track down the people with these nasty ideas so they can be watched and the public protected. It's mad nonsense. No one will be protected. ""Yes, I do like blowing people up and here is my home-made device"", just isn't a contribution people make to a debate. Those who sincerely and honestly participate in a debate, no matter how mistaken (and we always need to remember they may even be right) are the ones whose cherished sincerity and honesty needs protecting.

Yet I also don't do a lot of British things.

My dad feels the same way. He's been away from his homeland for so long it doesn't feel like home. He bought with him a tiny slice of culture from the 1960s to the UK along with many others. This culture is a snap shot of Asia in the 60s. His peers shared this slice of culture with him. It kind of didn't develop or grow in anyway. So as a result the 60s slice doesn't exist any more except amongst his peers which are dying off.

I remember the first time I went with him in 92 after he'd made his UK life stable enough to be able to return for more than a splash and dash. I was stood in the middle of Kowloon with him, he looked around and wondered where the beach he'd played as a child 22 years prior had gone. About how he'd swim to Stone cutters island (it's not a peninsula).

My own life is built of snap shots of the places I've lived in for a couple years at a time, as we moved around a lot. Perhaps the only things which haven't changed much are Cornish towns he lived in. So really I don't feel at home anywhere.

What a match that was, we looked brilliant in attack up until we started to get really sloppy with possession. I haven't been that nervous when watching a Wolves match in a while.

I thought that Dicko did really well to score both of his goals, I don't know how he managed to get that first goal in, it was such a tight angle.

Iorfa was very impressive as well, he's so ridiculously tall and fast for his age and for a right back, when he goes on one of his runs he almost reminds me of Yaya Toure. 

Dave Edwards is still one of my favourite Wolves players, I can see why Jackett likes to bring him on when we're starting to lose a hold on the game like what happened at Derby. What a header though, it reminded me of McAlinden's against MK Dons.


It's good to finally be in the playoff spots, if anyone said that we'd be challenging for promotion to the Premier League at the start of last season I think most of us would have been laughing.

null,false,Psyc5,null,null,null,"Because your average worker doesn't use the NHS, I can't believe how many people in this thread don't understand basic economics. 

This is how the NHS works, young and middle age workers pay into it through taxes, and then don't use it, at all, or if they do they add net gains, you as a average wage worker pay in £2.1K a year, you get ill once in the year, you go to the doctor, get some useless antibiotics that they prescribe you for a cold that won't work but will get you to shut up, that costs £200 in doctor and pharmacy time you put in £2.1K you took your £0.2K. 

You have just paid £1.9K for something you didn't use, and that is what the average young to middle age worker does every year, they pay for the NHS for everyone else, the old, the sick, the unlucky, so they have access to it when they need it. 

So they pay all their life so when they become old they can then take back out again, with your average person adding in exactly the same money they take out in a perfect system. In a perfect system there is no deficit or profit, everyone pays in on average, say £80K, between the age of 20-65, then from 65-90 they take out their £80K and all the books balance. 

Now less say you have your immigrant, I have also explained this in other manners in other comments, they come over here at age 25, and start paying taxes at the exact same rate as a UK citizen, the average rate was £1778 a year to pay in your £80K, but they didn't start paying at 20, they started at 25, so now, instead of pay for 45 years, they only pay for 40, so they only pay £71.1K back in, the problem is they still from age 65-90 use £80K in healthcare costs, that is a net loss of £8.9K.

And for all the dumbasses out there who are going to whine on, these are theoretical numbers, based on a average of the entire population, and do not reflect the financial complexities of the system, other than in an extremely simplified form.

In the end it comes down to this X - Y = 0, that is what your average person pays in and your average person takes out and that equals 0, if you turn up late (i.e. in middle age), you no longer pay in X, you no longer pay in too much for 45 years so you can take it all out again for 40 years after that, because you weren't here paying in for the 45 years, you were in another country.

null,false,bustedracquet,null,null,null,"Sold/Let Go:

- Petr Cech - ONLY after he breaks the clean sheet record.  

- Ramires - I love Ramires for his work rate and his attacking runs, but we can replace him with a central midfielder who brings an element of creativity and can actually make consistent passes. 

- Marko Marin - Bye bye German Messi, it's been real.

- Victor Moses - He's been doing well at Stoke, we'll probably allow the move permanent.

- Christian Atsu - He's a nice player and all, but I really don't see him ever having the potential to play for Chelsea at any point, especially as I see Traore as a superior prospect.

- Tomas Kalas - Yeah yeah I know one great game against Liverpool, but I asked a few Middlesborough fans how he's been doing, and they say he's been quite bad at CB, but he's pretty decent at RB. If he can't start for Middlesborough at CB, I don't see how he's ever going to have a future here at CB, and since we're already set on full-backs, I think we should move on from him. 

Buy: 

- Rob Green - GK - QPR - He's English and he's good enough in case of emergency, nuff said. 

- Aymeric Laporte - CB - Athletic Bilbao - Real Madrid are not going to sell Raphael Varane, he's off the table. But Laporte is not a step down at all, he's every bit as good as Varane is, and still gives us that optimal French connection CB pairing for the future with Zouma. He's also a left-footed CB so that's an extra perk. Laporte's release clause is 42 million euros, which with the fall of the euro, is 30.8 million pounds. If we throw in a season long loan for Oriel Romeu, that could probably push that figure down to 30 million pounds, which I think would be a coup for a future world class CB.

- Luka Modric - CM - Real Madrid/Joao Moutinho - CM - AS Monaco - Modric is only on the table if Real Madrid buy Pogba. But who knows whether that's going to happen, so I'm not gonna bother considering Modric. Modric and Moutinho both have attributes to fit well as a 3rd CM with Fabregas and Matic. They are both excellent passers and can control the pace of the game, but also, both are much better with the ball than Fabregas is, they are able to dribble around in tight spaces like how Cazorla does for Arsenal. They could also contribute to our pressing style, and they are both more than capable defensively. Also both are flexible, in that they can play in the double pivot, in a midfield 3, or as the No. 10. Monaco might be willing to sell if they don't end up making CL. 

- Roberto Firmino - CAM - Hoffenheim - If we can't get Moutinho/Modric, then I wouldn't mind going after Firmino and leaving the duties of backup CM/CDM to a combo of RLC and van Ginkel. We all know that Oscar has had a patchy 2nd half now for 2 straight years. IMO it's fatigue and nothing more, but I think it'd be silly if we didn't bring in some competition for him/somebody to rotate him with. Remember Oscar's going to be playing in the Copa America as well this year. Firmino is probably the closest thing there is to Oscar in a player. He's more physically imposing than Oscar, and probably has a better shot, but Oscar's passing is better, although not by much. Hoffenheim isn't going to be able to hold onto him for much longer, and since they aren't a very big club, they probably wouldn't be able to resist an offer if we come knocking, he'd probably be a lot cheaper than a lot of other options out there.

- Christian Benteke - ST - Aston Villa - Let me preface this by saying, I wouldn't be surprised if we don't even bother to try replacing Drogba and get another striker. Since Cuadrado can play up top as a 2nd striker, I think Jose wouldn't mind having another AM/winger to have on the bench to be able to rotate more with Oscar. That's why I think we've been linked with Douglas Costa so often. However, if we were to actually replace Drogba, then I see few better options who are as cheap and viable as Benteke is. Benteke is fabulous in the air, and is a brute, extremely strong, and his hold up play is decent enough, he's a really good finisher when put in front of goal, he just has no support at Aston Villa right now. His value is probably at it's lowest because of his lack of scoring the last few years and because Villa are likely to sell. It's also worth mentioning that he's really good friends with Hazard. 


Loanees: 

- Ruben Loftus-Cheek - He's not a loanee at the moment but if we get one of Moutinho/Modric, I'd like to see RLC be loaned to a PL side to get game time. If not, then I'd like to see him be stay with the team, and get more of a chance in games against lesser competition in the first half of the year.

- Marco van Ginkel - I still think van Ginkel has a future at Chelsea, and I'd like to have him stay here and train with the team. I think he could learn a lot from training with Fabregas day in and day out, and I think he's excellent cover for Fab if he ever gets injured. 

- Lukas Piazon - I still have high hopes for this kid, and since he seems to finally be settled playing in the Bundesliga, I wouldn't mind if we let him stay there for another year. Poor guy has been loaned out to 4 different countries in the last 4 years, I'd like him to have some stability for once. 

- Bertrand Traore - This guy has been tearing up the Eredivisie, and I think he's our most promising prospect (yes more than Bamford). I think he should stay at Vitesse for another year unless we can secure a loan to a PL side. I think PL experience is huge for players that are trying to break into our side at some point, and so even if he plays for a team like West Brom or something, I think the experience would be extremely valuable.

- Patrick Bamfordinho the GOAT - I love this kid. From the great finishes, to the perfectly executed knee slides, to the beautiful haircut, I want this guy to succeed with Chelsea so fucking badly. Everything he does, and I've only admittedly watched highlights and only seen him play a full game once or twice, reminds me of a young Torres. I think the best case scenario for Chelsea and for Bamford is for him to stay at Middlesborough for another year if they get promoted to the PL/secure a loan to another PL side. If Burnley stay up, I think he'd be a great fit there to replace Ings. 

 

TL;DR: If we can get Green, Laporte, and 2 out of Modric, Moutinho, Firmino, and Benteke, and we secure a PL loan for Bamfordinho the GOAT, I would be a very happy man with our transfer window.

1- Introducing/increasing tobacco and alcohol tax given how they're directly risk factors for a large number of comorbidities

2- Introducing a small standard fee (£5-10) per GP visit; a bit like a dentist. Granted, standard exceptions would apply to those whom are less fortunate, children, pregnant ladies etc...

3- If option 2 isn't as practical/ethical then certainly fining **WHO MISS THEIR APPOINTMENTS** since there is nothing more frustrating when it's the first/last person on your list and they decide not to turn up; *irrespective of their reason*, meanwhile someone else could've taken their place. I highly respect patients that have the common courtesy to call and cancel an appointment!

4- Back to the booze, why not charge patients that come up to the ED completely wasted in need of a bed and TLC. I just don't feel a bed in ED is the best place for them. If they paid to get in such a state, surely it's only fair for them to pay to get out of it provided they are otherwise medically stable?

5- Healthcare of the elderly. The majority of an individuals healthcare costs are accumulated in their last 10 years or so. We really need to re-think healthcare of the elderly and look into ways of integrating health and social care more. So many hospitals are on black alert at the moment due to a shortage of bed. I don't know any official statistics at hand, but from my personal experience, I would say 70% are over 70 and of those, 30% are medically fit for discharge but have no social support in place for them to be discharged to; so the safest option is for them to stay in hospital where they're at increased risk of hospital acquired infections etc...

After his first season full of injuries though? I think he is doing just fine in a completely foreign place. 

Also as far as the price, If we sold Kane for anything less than 26m at this point I'd be rightfully pissed off. Lamela was just as good for Roma as Harry has been for us. 15 goals and 3 assists in 30 games is pretty awesome for a 21 year old winger.

I don't buy this at all. At the very least, the is a non-obvious conclusion that really requires a source.

This assumes that the pool of tax paying immigrants take more from the NHS than they put in, which I highly doubt, given what you yourself said about usage through different age brackets. The funding of the NHS isn't a long term pension-like scheme, where each person's access to it is dependent on their total investment into it across their life. That defeats the whole point. It's a year by year money in minus money out scheme. As long as more comes in than goes out, it doesn't matter who has put in or taken out, as long as everyone involved is paying their taxes (or retired). Doesn't matter if you've been involved for a month, year, or decade. Otherwise you might as well go private and have each person save towards their own personal medical fund.

null,false,Bexie1989,null,null,null,"I went to both a Sixth Form attached to a high school and a college to do my A Levels (left Sixth Form during my first year, then went to college later to start over). Things might have changed from what I remember about them, though - I started Sixth Form in September of 2005, left in Febuary of 2006, and then went to College from September 2006-2008.

Tbh, Sixth Form was just like school, except you didn't have to wear uniforms. We had to be there by 8:45am for registration, even if we didn't have a class until the afternoon, and couldn't leave until 3:15pm when school ended, even if our only class was in the morning. You basically just had to sit about for hours in between. We also still had assemblies were we had to sit cross-legged on the floor to listen to whatever the teachers had to say, stuff like that. The work was obviously still the same level as what I did later at college, as it was still A Levels, but tbh that's all I really remember about Sixth Form.

College was a lot better in that respect. The college I went to did all sorts, not just A Levels - the A Level students were part of what was called ""The Academy"", centred in one part of the building, but there were also people there who did things like mechanics, hairdressing, health and social care, etc. There was also people of all ages there, not just 16 year olds just out of school - in my own A level classes there was a woman in her 50s. My mum also attended around the time I did, doing night classes in health and social care for her job.

Doing A Levels at college was very different from at Sixth Form. You only had to turn up when you actually had classes. You called all the teachers by their first names (shoutout to Dave the History God, lol), and in general were treated much more like an adult than a child. At Sixth Form, if you missed homework or something like that, you'd get in trouble, same as school. Don't do your homework at college? Well, that's your lookout, isn't it? There was much more of a ""This is your responsibility and don't come crying to us if you fail the exam because you didn't do the work"" attitude at college. They didn't chase you up or anything. I think if you were under 18, they'd inform your parents if you were missing too many classes, but that was about it.

At Sixth Form, we mostly hung out in the library as there wasn't really anywhere else to go. At college, there was the student bar, which is where pretty much everyone went during lunch or free lessons (unless you didn't have a lesson until the afternoon. Then you'd likely still be at home in bed). Technically you weren't allowed in the student bar if you were under 18, but this was rarely enforced. I turned 18 towards the end of my first year, and before then I was only asked for ID and then told to leave once - and that was by the Student Union president, rather than the people who actually worked in the bar.
I actually did my AS Psychology coursework sat in the student bar with a pint and a fag (this was just a couple months before the smoking ban came in in 2007). If we didn't go to the bar, we all usually went to someone's house after class. 

From what I remember of my time at college, classes were always double lessons lasting 3 hours, and there were two of them a day. You had two double lessons for each class a week (I think it was 2, anyway). So say I'd have History in the morning from 9-12, then there was usually a break until 2 (to the ~~bar~~ library!), and then I'd have Psychology in the afternoon from 2-5pm, for example. There were 2  days a week where I only had one class in the morning or afternoon. 

After my first year I dropped Psychology and just kept the other three, so then the time I would have spent in those classes, I would have had free (to be in the bar... lol)

Honestly though there were a few times where people (not me, honest) would go to the student bar in the two hour break and turn up for their afternoon class drunk. This wasn't accepted, though, obviously - if someone was obviously drunk they'd be kicked out of the class that day, and if they kept doing it they'd be kicked out of college entirely. There was however one time where we had a trip to London for a Government and Politics lecture - once it had finished our teacher took us all to the pub for a few hours before getting the train back in the evening. It was quite fun, sat in the pub having a few pints with your teacher. We all got pretty tipsy.

In terms of jobs, I had a part time job in a shop where I worked Friday nights 5-10pm and Sundays 9am-4pm. As I had a class on Fridays until 5pm, I had an arrangement with my manager that I would come in at 5:30 instead - which was still quite hard as my job was on the other side of town, so I had to carry my work uniform along with all my college work and books with me to college, run once class had finished to try and catch the bus to my workplace, and get changed in the loos at work. As I only did 12 hours a week, though, I didn't find it that hard to have time to still do all my work. The college recommended that students on full time courses did no more than 15 hours a week part-time work.

... I have no idea if any of this was helpful. I do tend to ramble and this ended up becoming more of a nostalgia post than anything else (sorry), but I tried to cover most of the things you asked. As I say, though, this was quite a while ago so I don't know what's changed. I know my old college has changed completely and moved to a new building. A lot of Sixth Forms attached to high schools, including the one I attended briefly, have been closed down, and instead there's now one really huge purpose built Sixth Form on the outskirts of town, which I believe is where most people doing A Levels straight from school go now.",null,0,null,1428370634,null,0,1428371004,0,cq3nan7,null,t3_31gm64,null,t1_cq3nan7,null,t3_31gm64,null,null,null,1432238031,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Awesome, so lets just import the entire of Africa and see how many days it takes for the whole NHS to collapse on itself, I am going to go with 1, 1 day. Hyperbole of course, but it is extrapolation of an event that is the problem.

Your fundamental miss understanding of basic economics just makes a rebuttal untenable as your point makes no sense, your argument boils down to ""the NHS doesn't need money to sustain itself"", which is just clearly untrue, the system is sustained by people paying in, young and middle aged working people, they pay for themselves, while barely using it, they pay for the poorer elements of society, they pay more than their fair share for the old as sufficient amounts wasn't taken off them previously while they were working, for many reasons. Facts are people who emigrant here weren't using the NHS, this point is irrelevant, because British tax payers were barely using it anyway, they are healthy and at work, they don't need it. So while your average British person has been paying in X and taking out maybe 1/5 of X, adding to the system the whole time, anyone from abroad has essentially being paying -4/5 of X. To extrapolate out from this point, what would happen if the entire old age population of Europe moved to the UK and decided to claim all their care on the NHS, if your answer isn't it would totally collapse, then go back to school.

The facts are it doesn't matter who you are you should get public healthcare, if you live in a magical fairy land where money doesn't exist, in the real world there is this place called the UK, has roughly 65-70 million people, this is what the system was designed to be sustained under, a dynamic but fairly steady system, we then join Europe, a fine choice, but to claim that if all 300 million Europeans came over here and decided to get treatment that the whole system wouldn't collapse, let alone anyone else who decides to turn up from around the world just passing through, is just quite frankly ludicrous. They are the facts of it, 10 people aren't going to break it, neither are 100, but at some point that number becomes thousands or millions, and if sufficient measures aren't put in place to normalise taxation of immigrants to allow for them to sustainably use the NHS, or legislation isn't put into place to stop them using the NHS until they are deemed a longer term resident of the UK, then at some point the whole house of cards falls down. I personally feel it is far better to allow access to it with a tax premium than charge them and require them to have insurance, I don't want that system, people in need should get help, but if you come over here you should be willing to contribute your fair share and to get to that fair share you have to pay more to catch up with everyone else. 

Facts are even if this is a relatively high number of people why should immigrants add less than British citizens to a system that Britain has upheld and sustained itself without any help from them for the last 60-70 years, is telling people they have to put in a bit extra to have access to one of the better and cheapest health systems in the world unreasonable, not at all, especially if they are short-term residents. I don't go on holiday to France without 3rd party health insurance, why would you move to a country expecting free healthcare when you have put nothing into their system? Is it actually unreasonable to ask people who presumable have come over here to find work to contribute before they take out?

An immigrant is immediately paying in from their first payslip and unless from the EU can't come here without a job, they never used the system without paying NI (unless they do before the first payslip!). And if from the EU you can recharge their country to a point anyways.

This isn't just one league we are competing in is many different ones. This isn't the mlb. My question is if the amount of money used in the mlb comparable to the epl? Wages and signing wise? Does he spend the same amount of money in wages as a team like city would or do they have a way smaller budget. Thank you guys.
