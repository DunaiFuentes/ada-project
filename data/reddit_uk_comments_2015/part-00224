&gt; I am just worried that I'm going to be the ""dumb American"" abroad and I want to know how to avoid that.  

Watch how everyone around you is behaving, and try to act the same way. Don't be all ""America #1"" or an ""Eagleland"" stereotype, and you should be okay.

If someone asks if they can ""bum a fag"", don't get offended; they're just asking you for a cigarette.

In pubs, most people stick with their friends.

Don't expect to be invited round people's houses, even for big sporting events. That's what the pub is for.

If you're with a group at the pub you'll probably be doing rounds. Each person takes it in turn to buy the drinks for the whole group, and it's rather bad form to ""coincidentally"" take a toilet or fag break when it's your turn. If you don't have the money to buy a full round, don't take part.

Do *not* call football ""soccer"". Here it's football and American football. Rugby is also quite popular, and it has two different playing styles; Rugby Union and Rugby League.

Make sure to find time to visit places outside of London. The UK is fucking tiny in comparison to America, and if you have a car you can explore most of Great Britain quite easily.

Swearing... it can be pretty casual, especially among friends. A lot of Americans I know online are shocked by how Brits just casually insult even their closest friends. An insult delivered in a friendly tone isn't really an insult.

Back to the UK being small... especially in cities, there is no real need to drive everywhere. There is probably a shop within walking distance of wherever you're staying. *Walk*! There's probably no parking anyway, or there's a horribly expensive charge for parking there. Personally I have an off-licence, two corner shops, two small versions of supermarket chains, and a proper supermarket all within about half an hour's walking distance, and I live right on the edge of a city.

If you see a pitbull in the UK, it's *not* a pitbull. They're actually one of four banned breeds here. It'll be a Staffordshire Bull Terrier. They're just as friendly as ""pibbles"", despite having pretty much the same bad reputation (I have a cross, who thinks she's a bloody lapdog).

Guns are fairly rare in the UK especially handguns, which were banned after the shooting at Dunblane school in Scotland. The majority of people won't have handled a real gun in their entire life, and won't particularly want to.

If you're bringing a kid across with you, be aware of film ratings. 12, 15, and 18 means that's the minimum age you have to be to see/purchase that film. 12A means kids under 12 need an adult with them at all times. These ratings, called BBFC ratings, are sometimes put on video games as well.

Drinking age is 18 here, not 21.

While we have some of the same fast food chains as you, the menu probably isn't the same. KFC is, I think, the one that confused my American friends the most. Also, portion sizes here tend to be a bit smaller than in America.

Tipping isn't generally a thing here. Most people will only tip at a restaurant, if they feel that the service deserves it (or they can't be arsed to faff about with getting change back).

ATMs (or cash points) are fairly common, and almost every British bank account comes with a debit card as standard, of the chip and PIN variety. *Most* cash points will not charge you for withdrawing money, even if that machine doesn't belong to the bank your account is with. Machines that *do* charge will tell you so upfront, and there's probably a free one within a short distance anyway. Sites like [this](http://www.link.co.uk/ATMLocator/Pages/ATMLocator.aspx) will help you find the nearest machine.

Growing up in the 90s I had a joy of watching us win promotions and cups. Then we became a team who just existed. We were never really going to get promoted from the Championship or relegated and it was kind of a 'meh' few years. I still went. Still sang. Still got angry when we lost. 

Then we got relegated from he Championship and since then we've been exciting to watch. Promotions. Playoff pushes. Relegation battles. It's been amazing. You're seeing the end of that now with our Premier League exploits. 

So... I don't really know why I support Leicester City. I just do. And always have. And always will.

We are a small country, but with 65 million people in so don't be the arrogant yank who assumes all the UK is the same - explore it and get to know it, London is great but very different to a lot of areas.

Meeting people is a real risk you have to live with, I meet people from time to time and it is quite harrowing. Ok seriously we are a lot more reserved than the US and strike up random conversations a lot less. I know NYC has a reputation of being unfriendly in the US, but I found them very exhaustingly friendly. It means meeting people is harder - but go to clubs that oractice your hobby etc were you can meet people. 

Tip less often and less in amount. Don't tip in cafes, pubs etc, in a restaurant you can tip around 10% if you like the service (please no more than that) but nobody wil take offence if you don't. Things like taxis I usually just say ""keep the change"" - eg £9 taxi give a £10 note, again not required. Also service is different here as your waiter will be less in your face and won't necessarily come and bug you, that isn't rude it is how we like it - some Americans interpret that as rudeness, it isn't, it is just how we do things.

null,false,PandaSymposium,null,null,null,"1) I'm procrastinating from packing to leave Albion House at the moment, so I can give you an up to date idea of Broadgate (Albion is one block within Broadgate, just far enough away from the main area to deserve a proper name. It's about 15 minutes from campus rather than literally across the road, but then it's cheaper. Remember, campus is pretty big in itself.) As others have said Broadgate is fairly standard. They've been quick to fix things that I've emailed them about. Have reasonable expectations and you'll be fine.

2) I'm not one for going out dancing, but Sundays at seven the Alternative Film Society (properly called Dark Celluloid because the people who created the society wanted to be edgy) shows something. Normally in Hallward Library (you will find out what and where that is) but we show enough foreign films to frequently use another room in the Portland building so we can see subtitles. If you're at all interested in deeper thought, arty films, cult shit, or whatever come along. After the films they always go down to Mooch (SU bar) and chart generally. It's a fairly small group, but they're all really welcoming and awesome and even if you didn't want to join the society they are a great in for any other weird shit that you want to do. They have members who participate in... Everything. Turn up and ask what questions you will. I realise that I deliberately derailed that to talk about one of my favourite societies, but I don't care.

3) The SU website (SU.Nottingham.ac.UK) has a full list of societies. Also, Welcome Week (because they fucked around with Fresher's Fair) will have various 'zones' around campus. Anything reasonably large would be represented there (in that you will be able to find them on your wanderings). If you want to find a smaller band of a particular type, there is a Battle of the Bands that a committee member of Dark Celluloid has been in so he could probably point you in the right direction. Feel free to ask around. You could always start a new one.

4) Throw yourself into random societies! Try It events are being encouraged by the SU this year, so you ought to be able to go to meetings and shit for free to see what it's like. Get involved with course specific stuff, so that you have something to talk about with people around you in lectures. I found sitting in the same area in lectures meant that I ended up with a fairly consistent crowd of recognisable people around me, even if I didn't know them all that well. Go to some societies consistently and be friendly to people who seem to know what they're doing. Only arseholes dislike freshers. We're just awesome. Don't stress too much about work, but keep up with it. Hey involved with CV boosting extra curricular stuff. If you can become active, you can reasonably become elected to a committee position. I'm really looking forward to mine next year. The SU is very supportive. Remember that all societies want you to join. And the SU wants you to join and run societies. If you want a very active society for random shit that has a lot of nothing to do with Quidditch, I understand they do a lot of socials and, well, everything. They can brand everything in the Harry Potter theme.

Contracts are almost entirely in the favour of the company. Any clause is there for the protection of them not you. That is why the wording is the way it is: it covers every eventuality, for them.

You know this is the case when you query it and they said ""oh that's just in there for if you trash a client's office"". If that was the case, it would be worded more like that! Instead it says ""ANY LOSSES CAUSED BY YOUR CONDUCT"". 

It's a typical HR strategy to downplay the wording and play on your ignorance (sorry) of ""scary"" contract wording. ""Oh we would never invoke that clause!!"" ""OK, remove it from the contract"" ""We can't do that""...

Basically, you have no bargaining power.

The Weeping Angels' activity had weakened the fabric of space-time in that physical and temporal area to the point where the Doctor would have risked irreparable damage if he used the Tardis to return.  



He also couldn't rescue Amy and Rory because it would have created a paradox: The Doctor and Amy only knew to go back to the '30s because Rory was written into the Doctor's *Melody Malone* book. The Tardis crew used the book to guide their actions because the story in the book mirrored the events that they were experiencing. That book turned out to have been written by River *after* the events of the episode happened, chronicling those events. Amy had written the afterword of the book towards the end of her life, establishing the fact that the two of them had lived out their lives in America without any further interference from the Doctor.

It's a bootstrap paradox: Essentially, something that resulted from the events of the story got sent back in time to prompt its own creation. It's similar to the events of *Blink* - Sally Sparrow wrote a journal that caused the Doctor to go back in time to prompt the events that caused Sally Sparrow to write a journal.

This helps an economy grow and develop the infrastructure it needs in the future to help it evolve, grow and help this nation compete.
Under osbournes plan, we can't build what we will need in the near future until we have the money, which depresses the growth we could have had. 
Forget about building nuclear power stations, new roads, towns, etc. And whilst other countries are not hobbled by this full retard policy we will fall further behind them. Well, not osbourne or his family, party and donors. They will be alright whatever happens, but everyone else will suffer.
Anyway, I'm sure he said the surplus would be used to pay for a tax cut. Upper rate tax cut mind you.

He's a politician first and chancellor second, people forget he is the tory party strategist. This is also about spin and politics, the current meme crafted by the Tories and their media is that ""labour spent all the money"". That the global recession is now the ""labour recession"" and that running the economy is like running a household budget, debt is bad, 
""if I have no money at the end of the week I can't buy a pint"" remember that bloke on question time telling a bemused ed millband that? 
That is the meme the Tories are spreading, that of labour oppose this they are still the party of ""economic incompetence"" and profligate spenders risking the growth the Tories have created as they are the party of economic competence.
This will split the left wing vote between a terrified new labour (tory lite) and the smaller snp, green, plaid parties that offer the alternative labour should be offering. A split vote on the left benefits the Tories hugely.

And the idea that the economy can be run as a household budget is laughable, if anyone comes up with that tripe ask them if they have a credit card? Or a mortgage? Then tell them to buy their house with only savings.

I don't trust anyone with the money, wouldn't even trust myself, but let's assume we're getting 45 for him. We've made 3 free signings, a midfielder (versatile), back-up GK and a striker. 

Aspas and other deadwood will be on the way out, so I'm going to say we have a kitty of around 50 million or so. First priority for me is a striker. I know we signed Ings, but if Sturridge still struggles like he did last season then Origi, Sturridge, Ings and Balotelli is by no means an improvement on the strikers from last season. I think we should cash in on Balotelli (or just keep him, I could care less tbh) regardless of the price and buy a good striker for 20-25 million. I really hope we can get someone to bang in the goals. 

Apparently the fee I just stated is the amount we're paying for Kovacic. I think he's a cracking player but I don't really think we need him. Apparently he plays a defensive midfielder who pushes forward (I'm sorry but we have Emre Can who is an absolute boss of a player and Kovacic arriving will only slow down his improvement or we'll see Can more at CB again) or as an attacking midfielder, where Coutinho and Lallana both excel. Again, I think he's a fantastic player but do we really need him with the amount of midfielders we have? 

Next priority after a striker is definitely a RB. I think we should give the 15 mil for Clyne hands down. He's a great RB, hungry, wants to play and English. It's a good deal for a RB who'll be with us for the next couple of years. Montoya for 10 million is also a good option, but I doubt Barca will sell. We should keep Manquillo as a back-up option (or Wisdom). A lot of people calling for a LB, but I think Brad Smith should be pushed up the order as back-up to Moreno. 

Moving onto CB, if Illori does exit as I don't see Rodgers giving him much of a chance, we need one, not really sure if we have interest in any, though. 

Lastly I don't think Sterling needs to be replaced. We have Ibe, Markovic, Coutinho, Lallana and Origi who can all play on the wing. They might not be as good or have the potential of Sterling but Ibe and Markovic can really make it far.

Two things to point out first of all.

1. Your situation sucks. Not because you are paying a large amount of money. But because you have no rights. She could take your money for 10 years, then turn around at the end of the 10 years and say ""screw you"". Until you are legally the father, you don't have rights here.

2. You don't have enough money to fight this. International lawsuits are always expensive. I'd imagine you'd have to pay a five-figure sum to get anywhere here. So you need to find a way of getting to an amicable solution.

My advice would be that rather than pay money to your spouse directly, to start paying money into some kind of escrow account with the conditions that the money will be available to your spouse only under certain conditions (you may need legal help here). That way, you are still contributing to your son's welfare, but she can only access the money by playing ball. The conditions I would suggest would be: i) your name is added to the birth certificate (that fact you are/were married may make this easier), and ii) you come to an agreement about visitation. That way, there is a massive incentive for her to come to an agreement with you (again, get legal advice over conditions for the agreement). If she doesn't come to an agreement (maybe add a time period?), make it so that the escrow account transfers into a trust fund for your child accessible at age 21, so that it benefits him, but not her.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"First off, I know a lot has been said about Raheem Sterling but I'm curious to know where it all went wrong. I feel like there's another side to this story. 

Generally speaking, I can break it down into three very broad reasons why a player would want to leave:

* Money
* Playing time
* Disagreement with coach(es) and/or ownership.

You can eliminate 'Playing Time' because Raheem Sterling would certainly get a significant amount of playing time at Liverpool FC and be a focal point of our attack. It's not so clear that he'd get that at clubs like, say, Real Madrid or perhaps even Man City.

Disagreement with ownership and/or coaches? I mean, aside from contract issues, has there been any serious issues between Sterling and the coaches and ownership? Both Rodgers and FSG have seemed to be at least publicly supportive of Sterling during any legal issue or whatever.

So, to me, that just leaves the issue of money: Sterling wants more; LFC doesn't want to give it to him.

And that's a shame. Sterling's representatives have seemed to force LFC's hand and demand more money and I think they were surprised when LFC declined and instead of accepting defeat, they seemed to fight even harder to get more money and threaten to leave.

It's a shame because I think Sterling and/or his representatives were unable to swallow their pride and let their ego get the best of them.

And now here we are.

And from a club perspective, it's frustrating after all the time and money we've invested in a young talented player to help him succeed.

If/when Sterling leaves, it's even more frustrating because that departure continues to hurt our leverage in other transfers:

* Every club knows we have Sterling Money.
* Every club wants to get us to overpay.

Credit to Suarez. When we kept him, he *still* played his heart out for Liverpool. Can we expect the same thing from Sterling? I don't feel as confident about that. So forcing Sterling to stay may not be the best option.

Therefore, I think if Sterling really wants to leave, we should sell him as quickly as possible and for as much money as possible so we have the time to craft an appropriate strategy for the money we have and have the time to do battle against clubs who want to try and get us to overpay.",null,0,null,1434184841,null,0,false,0,cs548kk,null,t3_39mx57,null,t1_cs548kk,null,t3_39mx57,null,null,null,1436961889,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Atleast that was the argument for austerity a few years back, now it's more kinda Keynesian in that we save while the economy 'grows' for the hard times.

The counter points being there is no need to cut spending because once real wages pick up the government will have the tax revenue it needs from income tax etc.. and cutting will just delay this. Actually there's like a bunch of counter arguments to this that would take a while to explain but tbh if you look over his last time as Chancellor you can kinda see he's not to bright on the economics front after realising cutting so deeply so quickly is a bad idea. 

The only thing we need to know is he prefers the incentive kind of economics... actually I'mnot even sure of that with the tuition fee raise, maybe he figures everyone would keep going anyway... which turned out to be true.. but not because of his doing.

I guess that's why he kept the whole 'normal times' thing in there as that is very open to interpretation for government borrowing. Then again any economist will tell you borrowing whilst interest rates on government bonds are low, about 2.1 percent right now is a good idea to invest for the future. However that opens a whole another can of worms because by the time HS2 is done will we even be using trains that much, overrun costs etc. 

Either way it's just a terrible idea to shit on welfare imo, Osbourne would argue it gives incentive to get into work and so tax revenue increases, I would argue that the worst off spend the highest percentage of their income and so boosts consumer demand which gives more growth. Tbh this doesn't cover most of the aspects of it but you can see how their is more than one side. 

Morally though, if you pay into a system through income tax, VAT whatever, which everyone does, then your damn right it should have your back or else it gives to much power to employers. That leads to bad pay weakening demand because people won't have the balls to ask for much and so weakens the economy and the business which refuses the pay rise. Then there's bollocks like low morale leading to less productivity, which is a big problem right now.

Tbh it would take an a few thousand words to properly get into any of these points and the up and downsides of any of these issues.

The original vibe inevitably is lost to some extent, but that doesn't mean that the 'newcomers' don't enjoy it, but the people that saw what it was at 'sub 2000 people' won't enjoy it as much, and might look for another up and coming festival.

The example I have in mind is The Big Chill, but I expect it might apply to all festivals that have grown over the years. People who went to early Glastonbury, I expect, would recognise this.

&gt;We HAVE to sell him now imo

Yes, absolutely agree there.

I was hoping that Sterling and/or his representatives and the club would all reach a happy resolution but it doesn't seem like that will happen.

The club has every right to retain Sterling (as he is under contract) but I have a hard time believing that Sterling would give his 100% to Liverpool for the remainder of his contract.

(And on a side note, credit to Suarez who wanted to leave, stayed for another season, and played his heart out).

So, yes, I agree. Move Sterling as quickly as possible so we have as much time as possible to figure out how best to use the money we get especially considering a lot of clubs -- knowing we have the money -- will try and get us to overpay for a player.

&gt; i still cant think who would be a suitable realistic replacement!

This is where I disagree.

I think too many times during a transfer window, supporters focus too narrowly on like-for-like replacements.

Sterling is out; New Sterling is in.

First off, I believe it doesn't necessarily work that way.

Second, while I firmly believe in Sterling's immense talent, significant potential and importance to our side from week to week, Sterling was not necessarily a focal point of our offense.

To be honest, we are not a complete, cohesive team yet. Most of our players aren't in their final form yet.

* Players like Henderson and Coutinho have shown significant improvements from season to season but they are not quite fully evolved yet.
* New Transfers have shown glimpses of brilliance but have still yet to fit in properly because of inexperience and/or a lack of familiarity with their teammates.
* Brendan Rodgers is also evolving as a manager as well. With the attacking prowess of Suarez and Sturridge, he is able to manage the side very well but he needs to be able to evolve to a point where he can still win *without* Suarez and Sturridge. I still think he can do that.

I don't think we're at a point where we can split hairs and say such-and-such player is the key to unlocking our potential. I don't think we're at a position of luxury where we can say we should replace this player with that. And from a business perspective, I don't think we're at a position where we can have x-amount of money and assume we can just go out and simply re-invest that money into a specific player.

And I think that's the frustration that a lot of us are having these days.

We *want* to believe we're just a player or two away. And speculating on a few specific players is much more entertaining in a forum like this one and with your mates at the pub.

The far more boring and frustrating reality is that we're not a specific player or three away because we are not a cohesive *team* yet. Heck, we still argue about what our best formation is from week to week.

All of this is difficult because we have yet to become a *team*. Too many players with loads of potential aren't quite consistent enough, have not grown enough, have not experienced enough.

To me, the question isn't necessarily ""who do we get to replace Sterling when he leaves.""

To me, I think we simply need to continue accumulating as much talent as we can get and keep pushing towards creating a cohesive team.

Of course, that talent may not be the sexy, marquee names... but I'd rather have a squad that plays like a cohesive team rather than a collection of marquee individuals.

Isn't the fact that they are not equal a bit of a problem with the system though? As a union of four countries, the UK is similar in concept to a federation of states such as the US. In most federations, special (and equal) representation is given to the constituent states themselves as well as to the citizens of each state, specifically to avoid the situation where the largest or richest states have all the power and the others go along for the ride. That's why each state in the US has equal representation in the Senate despite the enormous difference in population between the biggest (California with over 30 million people) and the smallest (Wyoming with under 1 million).

If you want to retain the union, the UK needs something similar.

Our problem last season was our defence. I think we have done a pretty good job of improving that, given that our players are young and hopefully will be more settled this coming season. Add a quality right back this summer and we're pretty solid.

Let's say your facial recognition technology is 90% accurate. The article says 120,000 people attended last year and 91 people were arrested.

90% accurate means 10% of the crowd will be mistakenly flagged as a criminal and 90% of the people who were arrested could have been identified this way. (We don't care about negatives because we don't follow up and therefore don't know if they were true or false)

    120,000 * (1-0.9) = ~~1,200~~ 12,000 false positives
    91 * 0.9 = 81.9 true positives

So out of ~~1,282~~ 12,082 people this tells you are criminals, only 82 of them actually are making your scan ~~6%~~ 0.7% accurate in practice.

Facebook, which carefully arranged photos of your friends, taken and re-taken to get the best view of everyone gets 97% accuracy in their facial recognition. So if you were to take mugshots of everyone as they arrived to ensure good photos, the same calculation would creep up to ~~20%~~ ~2% accuracy.

Your test has to be accurate on a scale of how common what you are trying to assay is. In this case ~~99.247%~~ 99.92% accuracy before your practical results are 50/50.

If I may, I'm going to offer up a different analysis.

When the road splits out into two lanes (just after the keep left signs) the bus is very obviously continuing in lane one and the two riders move out into lane two.

Now watch the buses brake lights. They're off right until the bus leaves the underpass, then they come on (just after the offside shoulder check) [This is very difficult to see because of the overall change in light levels, but I'm certain the buses brake lights activate just as the buses tail leaves the underpass]. This is the clue that folk should be looking for, riders and drivers alike. ""Why is that bus braking on a straight, clear stretch of road when there's a green light at the next ATS?"" My first instinct is to say that there's a push-bike ahead of the bus and the bus will want to get round it.

It's at that point you assess whether it's safe to continue your intended overtake or not. Personally, I don't know whether I would've gone for it or not. I think I probably wouldn't have purely on the basis of; not knowing why the bus was braking, therefore ""stupidity is about to happen in front of me, I want no part of it"" and the ""law of gross tonnage"".

My reading of the vehicles' relative positions and blindspots of that bus tell me that when the bike was behind the bus it *was* visible in the buses side mirrors. I see that as being true for about three seconds *before* the bus started it's manoeuvre and during those three seconds the bike was very, very clearly making ground on the bus.

I really am more inclined to blame the bus driver for this one. I think he knew there was one motorbike behind him, but I don't think he knew about the OP. So I think he waited for the one bike to go past and either didn't bother to check his mirrors, or didn't check them properly. Nor did he use his indicators at all. He basically manoeuvred blind and stupid. IMO.

@/u/miked12, I thought your reactions were good and you stayed upright which is always to be commended. Just be wary of things like that happening again. Unexplained braking from vehicles ahead is a good indicator that something stupid about to happen in your vicinity.

As others have said, a couple of honks of the horn can be a lifesaver if you're not sure if a heavy/large vehicle is aware of you or not. It's worked for me in getting buses and articulated lorries to cancel indications into my lane when I've been there, or been about to be. But I had the benefit of an indication, you didn't.

I also would like to point out that immediately afterwards backing off and putting some space between you and the bus is absolutely the right thing to have done there so good job. Also, the presence of mind to mirror and shoulder-check to your rear and near-sides is worth a bit of praise.

The three final blasts after you undertook him were silly though. You can't communicate what happened in three blasts of a horn. Better to have let it go because because it's just petty rebuking without any real meaning. The horn should be used to make other road users **aware** of your presence. Not to chin them.

I'm wary about suggesting this but you could e-mail the bus company with a link to the video. But be clear what you want out of this course of action though. My intentions would be to educate the bus driver, with no further consequences than that - not to have him punished, reprimanded or fired. So I'd be very **very** clear about that. I'd only want the driver to know what happened, from my point of view, so that they knew why I were annoyed and why what they did was dangerous. They pulled out into me.

I think this is a good example of reading what you want to read from an article rather than what it actually says. The closest the author gets to saying the 1981 statement was wrong was that they overestimated the severity of their predictions; in all other respects, they were correct and the validity of monetarism is yet to be proven (see the section *The statement in retrospect*). Thatcher's government got it right, it just wasn't from forcing deflation.

The real problem with the statement was that it appealed to the politics and emotion of rejecting Friedman and maintaining the status quo.

And that's *his* job. People keep thinking that the job of government ministers is to run the country in a good and sensible way. It is not: the job of government ministers is to get re-elected to government at the next election.

Anything which they do and which *happens* to be good is a happy byproduct.

I always advise people to start with the fifth (2010) season of the new series with the episode *The Eleventh Hour*. Then, maybe after a couple of seasons, think about doubling back to season one and seeing those stories.

It's a soft reboot of the show and is designed as a jumping-on point for new viewers. You don't need to know anything about the show to jump on with season 5, the premise is reintroduced to the viewer as if it were season one, episode one. Don't feel overwhelmed by the big 'Fifty Years' thing. Yes, the show has been going for fifty years, but the writers are very good at acknowledging the show's extensive history without making any of it required viewing. You will never find yourself in a situation where a story doesn't make sense because you didn't watch serial seven from the 1975 season, for example.

It's still the same show, but with season 5 the entire cast and crew changed, and the feel of the show just got *better*. That's subjective, of course, but everyone I know who has watched the show live or binged it has said the same thing - *""The fifth season was totally game-changing. It made everything before it look like a kid's show.""*

I mean, Doctor Who *is* a kid's show. But I'd say that from the fifth season they stop *treating* the viewers like kids. Again, very subjective, and there will be people who vehemently disagree with me, but I know I'm not alone in this opinion.

I say this because I feel like the first four seasons of the show are great in their own way, but a lot of potential fans are put off by their uneven tone.",null,0,null,1434194792,null,0,1434195529,0,cs56b99,null,t3_39oqyt,null,t1_cs56b99,null,t3_39oqyt,null,null,null,1436963337,null,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9,null

http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia_law#/media/File:Use_of_Sharia_by_country.svg

The majority of muslims live in those countries where Sharia law is followed entirely, and even in the ones where it's ""personal"" there is still often news about people being dragged into the streets and killed because they were merely accused of something against Islam, like somalia or even egypt, in those countries despite it not being criminal law it's still upheld by the people in a lot of places. 

http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/ShariaLawOrOneLawForAll.pdf

This says 61% of British Muslims think gays should be punished, that's BRITISH, do you think that number gets better in Islamic countries? If it was Afghanistan that number would be 99% only because you couldn't rule out the possibility of somebody being against it but you would never actually find that person.

http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf 

This shows the amount of Muslims that want Sharia law to be official law, in the countries where Islam is the official religion the lowest in favour of Sharia law is 56%, the three above it are in the 70's, then a bunch of more in the 80's and a few in the 90's, and surprise surprise Afghanistan is at 99%. And official law means it's entirety so killing gays and apostates is included in that. These polls are done by legitimate research groups btw and there is a lot more where they came from.

I can use ISIS because they exist for one reason, to spread Islam and create a caliphate while enforcing Sharia law without compromise, not to get rid of westerners like other terrorist groups did. They have support because people believe in it, if it was about the war why didn't other terrorist groups have support like ISIS do?

Islam is very clear on a lot of these bad things and it's set up in such a way that makes it seem like you have to believe it all or nothing and you can't question anything because that would be blasphemy and punishable by death, and you're reminded of these things every few hours when you go to prayer, and it has Sharia law that controls every part of peoples lives, it's not just things like ""kill gay people"" it has a lot about family matters, financials, marriage, etc. So how can the application of it be a problem when it's so clear about things, it's just the belief in it at all that is the problem.

Obviously a lot of people don't believe in a lot of those things but those are the good apples, the people that left Islamic countries and started to forget about things bit by bit. So the fact remains that Islam in it's current state is inherently bad and the good Muslims are still a tiny minority, it has a long way to go to be like Christianity.",null,0,null,1434196673,null,0,false,0,cs56r1h,null,t3_39kaqn,null,t1_cs56r1h,null,t1_cs55ojl,null,null,null,1436963616,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

He created and wrote the amazing kids TV show Press Gang in the early 90's.  Then he created what, in my opinion, is one of the best and most underrated British TV Comedies of all time in Coupling.  He then went on to write the BEST episodes of the RTD Era of Doctor Who with Blink, Silence In The Library, Empty Child, Girl In The Fireplace etc.  He introduced Captain Jack, River Song and took over as show runner of the show and took it from silly farting aliens and peter kay in the fat suit to intelegent, well written story arcs with complex storytelling techniques.  He brought us amazing Companions with Amy and Clara, he went into an era where everyone said no one could follow David Tennant but literally crashed in with Matt Smith who was epic and held his own, if not beat, Tennant's Doctor.  Now we're in a new era, I'm not sure about it.  I'm certainly not as high yet on Capaldi as I always have been on Smith but there was potential.    During the Moffat era the show became international, it's not just a British Drama it's an international sci-fi property with the reach and scope of a Star Trek and fandom of Star Wars.  

Bottom line is Moffat is absolutely deserving of this award.

Really doesn't add anything to the point and suggests that the commenter is somehow less because of the circumstances of his birth.

He's not suggesting that the Irish flag has an equivalence with a UVF flag by itself, but the manner in which it was used. 

I've no issue with any flag being raised over Stormont in line with protocol, if a dignitary was visiting by all means, if by some democratic means Northern Ireland was transfered into the Republic or some other change in sovereignty happened then that would be an appropriate occasion to raise the Irish flag over Stormont. 

But as we all well know that isn't the case here, its use in this instance wasn't to be representative but an attack on democracy and sovereignty. And I would be wary of anyone who thinks a flag used in such a manner is representative of them in the same manner I don't believe a union flag getting flown to tatters represents me.

Another point that needs addressed is that a shared future does not mean equality or neutrality, especially not in terms of sovereignty. Shared future means we accept the differences and we get on with it, not that we are overly accommodating to the point we deny what the practical reality of the situation.

In 1815 the war was over and Napoleon didn't have much hope of retaking all the territory he once controlled.

However, Napoleon had long since won by 1813 in the sense of the impact he had made. In Civ 5 terms, he'd won on a cultural victory. When he was captured after Waterloo he was held on a British warship while the Allies decided what to do with him and he ended up docked in a bay off the British coast for two weeks. Every day, crowds of people lined the cliffs to catch a glimpse of him, something like 150,000 people came to see him in the two weeks he was docked. There was even talk that the British had wanted to take him to London to have talks, but were so scared that he might incite a revolution in England they dare not let him off the ship. 

While he didn't write the principles of the French Revolution of equality, fraternity and liberty, he entrenched them into Europe's psyche. The old ways of the European order were crumbling and after hundreds, if not thousands of years of serfdom within 50 years of Napoleon almost all the major countries of Europe was turning into a democracy.

Drugstore brand 'Collection' do good, cheap, natural-looking false lashes. 
Bourjois is one of my fave drugstore brands. Both their powder and cream blushes are nicely pigmented. Their kohl and liquid liners have always worked well for me, and their Healthy mix serum and foundation are great drugstore foundations. Also their 123 CC cream has been my summer go-to so far.
Beauty UK (at Superdrug) has a good and cheap cream contour palette worth checking, if you're into that?

Some jokes are universal, some US sitcoms managed to achieve worldwide appeal (Friends...) but clearly Seinfeld didn't achieve the same success.

null,false,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,null,"What the other guy said is pretty stingy with the tipping if you ask me. I would say tipping is definitely a thing in the UK, it's just not such a big deal or as frequent. It's mostly constrained to paying for a sit down meal. Tipping 5% for passable service, 10% good/satisfactory service, and 15% for great service and you happen to be feeling generous. The only time I've known anyone leave no tip whatsoever is when the food/service was bad. I know some Americans feel obliged to tip even on poor food because ""it's not the waiter's / waitress' fault"" but there's no need to think that in the UK (also they are waiters and waitresses in the UK, server is not a term that has caught on and will lead to confusion.) 

That said there are situations where you can tip in the UK if you want to, for example I will tip my hairdresser by rounding to the nearest five and will regularly tell taxi drivers to keep the change if a journey costs 17/18 quid for example, although neither of these are required or expected and if I'm poor that month I won't.  

I think one important difference to note is that most places require you to go to the bar to pay for your drinks. Even in places that are restaurants as well as drinking establishments they'll have sections that are waited for diners and everyone one else will get up to get their drinks. There are some exceptions to this naturally, for example small restaurant/bar/café hybrids where they don't distinguish between people drinking and eating, but still it's not the  norm.

Another thing OP should note is that you'll want a debit/credit card with a chip in it, I don't know if they've been full introduced in the US yet. They're not even allowed to take your card away as they do in many countries, they'll bring the chip and pin machine to your table if you want to pay that way. 

Another thing Americans are always shocked by is people saying ""you all right?"" (y'right?) and ""that's all right"", because Americans tend to use the former purely for when someone appears sick or distressed whilst in the UK it just means the same as ""How's it going?"" and the latter is typically used for accepting apologies when in the UK it's more like ""You're welcome"" or ""No worries"".

I also think it's fine to speak to people in pubs but you have to learn how to do it. Lots of people go to pubs just to be around friends, but when the time is right it's ok to strike up a conversation with a stranger, I'd recommend Americans don't try this straight away though and get a feel for how things work lest they intrude on people who don't want to have a chat. 

I think it's important for Americans (and all ex-pats to some degree) to de-nationalise when they arrive in another country. Particularly Americans though. For example don't point out every little minutiae of difference to the locals and expect them to care, it will only sound like you're have a pop at the country. Don't assume the way your country does things is ""the norm"" and differences elsewhere are ""quaint"" and ""charming"". Think more internationally as if the world were your home and the ways of doing things in different country were second nature to you, even when they're not.

I think for many Americans, being American is big part of their identity, and while this exists in every country there's definitely less of it. Where you were born is just where you were born, a random act of fate, it's not who you are. Countries are just countries all with good and bad, all different. 

One thing worth noting is that America has a pretty unique attitude towards foreigners. Especially foreigners of countries they find interested whose countries don't provide a great deal of 1st generation immigration to the US these days. They tend to give them attention, and can lead to them feeling like some kind a rare specimen. They often say things like ""Welcome to America"" and expect you to be overwhelmed by the uniqueness of their society (when in reality it's much like everywhere else for the most).

This is not an attitude that exists in the UK, there are plenty of Americans in the UK and Europe as a whole, foreigners are incredibly common, many of us have visited America or different parts of the world, failing that most have a good idea what other societies are like, especially American society, so don't play up these notions of difference. Many Americans naively think they are vastly different from other parts of the world. Just assume you are another resident of England with all the same rights and entitlements. Sure your accent's a little strange, yes you are a foreigner, but given you speak English there's almost no barrier for you. Have a nice time.

null,false,Serex123,null,null,null,"Hanging up an anarchist flags and a sign that says ACAB ('all cops are bastards') doesn't help your cause, nor does destroying the inside of a building even if vacant, or letting off flares. There are better ways to go about raising asareness of homelessness, and many people do work towards this issue using far better methods.

Quite frankly, you look less like a group lf activists trying to help homeless people and more like a group of anarchists exploiting the issue of homelessness to promote your own anti-establishment and anarchist/socialist (or whatever) views.

Drop the anarchist symbology, the ACAB flags, take off the guy fawkes masks (they alone make you look like a bunch of clowns) and any other political symbology and focus exclusively on the issue. Volunteer for the YMCA. Collect and distribute food parcels. Anything that doesn't involve a stand off with the police really. Keep it seperate from the politics.

Also, don't hide your faces. There's no reason why you should have to. It looks intimidating. It looks like you are purposefully trying to cause trouble. It looks like you are exploiting a genuine issue so you can get in trouble with the police and courts in order to feed into an anti-establishment narrative. Show your faces: show that you wre proud, that you have some authenticity.

I'm sympathic to the anti-fascist cause, but don't fly antifa flags. If you do the police will always have to step in due to the risk of neo-nazis and groups like the EDL/NWI/BNP turning up. Essentially, campaign somewhere where the public can interact with you; otherwise you'll look intimidating and there's notjng stopping the police putting a fence around you. A website. An official spokesperson. A stall with information pamphlets (again, non-political - don't turn it into a SWP recuiting station). Points of contacts, even if just an email address help.

Don't take the piss out of other businesses. Pay for your own food, water, et, and accept donations. Don't let your supporters hijack the tables outside of cafe nero for example, even if that staff don't mind. Have a zero tolerance approach on drugs and drink.

they consciously reject such thought but seems clear to me that it gnaws them still, so then you get these quite extreme gushes of support for opposing ideas as if shouting it louder will make them a true beleiver (in a similar way that gays in the closet can be some of the biggest homophobes). so in feeling guilty about their own self perceived weakness and failure due to that remnant of free will thinking, they will champion any underdog due to identifying with their perceived oppression that group faces - they see themselves in all these groups and so will defend those groups in defense of their own view of themselves.

you can see them switch when in any narrative a group which in a different narrative was the underdog becomes the oppressor, they will tacitly contradict their own message as you see in this case, in rape culture narrative the oppressor group is males and victim/underdog group is females, in the wider left wing narrative on race relations/multiculturalism (which i'd say, to them, rotherham etc falls into) the oppressor group is white british society and the underdogs are muslims, despite it being almost undeniable that there is a rape culture in such places exactly like what they shout about, they are not interested in criticising anything there because due to them not perceiving muslims or whoever as an oppressor group in these situations, it wouldnt satisfy their emotional needs.

the immigration debate is another one, if you were to say ""the working classes are idiots"" the left wing rage would be massive (oppressor group - upper classes, victim group - working class), yet they will say prettymuch the same thing in other terms about the same people when it becomes a matter of immigration (oppressor group - native brits, aka ""the working classes"". victim group - immigrants), the whole ""well if the locals would turn up sober and on time maybe they wouldnt be replaced by poles"" or the whole ""british culture is shit, we need to become more diverse"", imagine if i said, ""working class culture is shit"", which is clearly what people mean by that, given the usual examples people give of it's shitness.",null,0,null,1434202764,null,0,false,0,cs58ic2,null,t3_39oxfc,null,t1_cs58ic2,null,t3_39oxfc,null,null,null,1437556909,null,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10,null

&gt;It is the most basic and lowest rank of a man who has been [knighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight) by the monarch but not as a member of one of the organised [Orders of Chivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_order). Knights Bachelor are the most ancient sort of British knight (the rank existed during the 13th century reign of [King Henry III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_III_of_England)), but Knights Bachelor rank below knights of the various orders.

&gt;There is no female counterpart to Knight Bachelor. The lowest knightly honour that can be conferred upon a woman is [Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Commander_of_the_Most_Excellent_Order_of_the_British_Empire) (DBE) – which, technically, is one rank higher than Knight Bachelor (being the female equivalent of 'KBE' or [Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Commander_of_the_Most_Excellent_Order_of_the_British_Empire), which is the next male knightly rank above Knight Bachelor).

But for whatever reason, at the end of the season before the last year of his contract the club came back with numbers that were lower than what they all agreed upon. Apparently, Macca didn't take that too well and made the decision to leave at the end of the season with Toshack trying to lure him to Real Madrid. Robbie was saying the club didn't help the situation and actually forced Macca to leave the club saying that there was no way that he was signing the altered contract after the what was initially agreed upon. 

Sad day when it happened. Though I always have the funny memory of Macca wearing two different style boots at the same time while playing for Madrid. Happy that he got the success that he had while playing abroad. If I remember correctly, he stated that one of his regrets that he rather have won the Champions League in a Liverpool shirt.

Classic series (1963-1989)
Doctors 1-7 
What started out as a black and white monster of the week series became Britain's most popular show for its terrifying monsters, endearing characters, and creative use of time travel. The main character, the Doctor, was a mysterious man who has a time machine called the TARDIS (Time and Relatively Dimesion In Space) that was disguised as an old British Police Box, and stayed that way be accident. The Doctor was revealed to be an alien, a Time Lord of the Planet Gallifrey, and due to the old age of the first actor, they came up with a biological process of Time Lords called regeneration that could save the Doctor's life if he was dying, but only 12 times for a total of 13 bodies, each one with a different face (actor), personality, and clothing choice. As the Doctor travels through time, he makes friends that he travels with that we call companions. This is how a show can ""run"" for over 50 years. 

The wilderness years (1999-2004) 
Doctor 8 only 
The show was unofficially canceled in 1989. In 1996, a TV movie tried to revive the series with the eighth Doctor, but failed. Not much happed during this era other than novels and comics for Doctor Who

Revival series (2005-now)
Doctors 9-12 so far
Miraculously, Doctor Who was truly revived and became one of the most popular shows once again. Using old and new characters made the show feel truly ancient and new at the same time. An off screen event known as the Last Great Time War ended with Gallifrey destroyed and the Doctor alone in the universe.

This series is NOT a reboot but a continuation of the old. My personal recommendation is to start here with season 1, Episode 1 ""Rose"". There might be better episodes to start with but if you can't pass here, there is little hope. The CGI might not be the best but it is in the characters and story telling where it shines.

Milner is a massive upgrade on what Stevie offered last year.

I haven't seen much of Ings playing, but from what I've seen he'll be a massive upgrade on the worthless performances of Balo. He charges down defenses and we suffered a lot this year from only having one player (Raheem) at the top of the line who did that well. Putting teams under pressure completely changes the nature of a game. The games we dominated in our second season under Brendan may have featured a lot of goals, but there were so many more opportunities because teams never got comfortable as Suarez, Sterling, Coutinho, and Hendo charged them down. Studge, for all his abilities, I think needs someone like Suarez around to make him fight. I don't even mean Suarez's talent, I just mean his graft. No one wants to look like the lazier player (except Balo of course).

As for Bodgan? WGAF? He's a backup keeper. Mignolet did enough to earn the spot another year. This mythological goalkeeper competition thing just doesn't happen. Where each push each other to be better. There are very few situations where that doesn't end badly. So, my expectation is that we'll keep Migs until there's an obvious better replacement within reach of a particular window's budget. This summer we've got more pressing needs.

Anyway, Brendan is very outspoken about how he wants to play the game.  He wants to dominate possession and strangle the life out of the other team by making them do all the work chasing the ball around.  We've really only had 1 decent run playing like that since he took over though and it was the tail end of his first season in charge.  Other than that we've looked our best when playing rapid counter attacking football.  I don't think Rodgers wants to play that counter attacking style though, which is why he keeps trying everything he can to move away from it.  

Unfortunately the results of trying to bring more possession into the strategy have resulted in lethargic, uninspired, slow, and unimaginative football where we have absolutely nothing going forward but we're still a defensive nightmare.  I think BR knows how he wants the team to play, but he doesn't really know how to get the team to that point (he's been trying to do it for 3 seasons now) and he's a bit stubborn about changing his ethos to suit what the team is best at doing.  He needs to really take a good, hard look at how he expects the team to play and adapt to the players he has rather than trying to shoehorn a bunch of players into positions that don't suit them and play with a tactical approach that doesn't suit them.",null,0,null,1434207698,null,0,1434207962,0,cs5ad77,null,t3_39ox6f,null,t1_cs5ad77,null,t1_cs58w3m,null,null,null,1436966117,null,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8,null

Behind the company is American luxury duty-free shopping pioneer Robert Miller, reported to have acquired UK citizenship but to reside tax-efficiently in Hong Kong. As with any property owned by an offshore company, the precise reasons for the structure are hard to discern – and Miller didn’t answer the Eye’s request for an explanation – but the American is perfectly placed to benefit from the inheritance tax breaks given to a “non-dom” on overseas assets and is likely to have escaped stamp duty when his company acquired the estate in 1998. None of this prevented the EU paying agricultural subsidies to the estate over a decade or so of €430,000.

I just don't like when either assist or key pass is thrown around to justify a player's ability or whatever. Sure, the more a player has the more likely he's a good player, but until you look at each pass or assist in isolation it doesn't make any sense. Just because Benteke had more key passes then the other strikers mentioned doesn't necessarily make him more creative.

I agree with not having either, but if we had to get one it would be Dzeko. Proven to score goal of all sorts for a big team.

After lobbying from Ireland's football governing body, the [Football Association of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Ireland), FIFA ultimately changed its transfer regulations in January 2008.

If we were rumoured to pay 40m for some young spaniard who had an up and down year but had loads of ""potential"" people who be losing their minds saying Txiki out. 

And yes, I do realize we need HG players, but there are other options that wouldn't sacrifice the quality of a side who could titles. Cresswell is one of those options, especially looking at the state of our LB play last year.  A very good English backup keeper could be another like Rob Greene perhaps. I'm making the case that when we pay for potential like Sterling and pay an English premium, then that's actually us sacrificing the quality of our side; we can't afford to plug in ""potential"" at such an important position like attacking mid/winger for a side that emphasizes attacking football.

When the application's are open you send in a form.  It asks the usual: why would you be good on, interesting facts about yourself, preferred subjects etc... Make yourself sound fun, interesting and competitive and you'll hopefully be asked to an audition. Be yourself, but make sure you hype yourself up.

The audition is a mini game of pointless in a hotel conference room with half a dozen other couples and a couple of production staff being the hosts. 

My sister and I acted it up a bit, I pretended to think of answers last second and during the team part I pretended I was guessing at a low scorer (got 2 points).  I tried to give them what I thought they would want to see on TV. 

We then had to answer some questions in front of a camera to send back to the main producer, acted it up again. Goaded my sister a little to show some personality. 

We got a call pretty soon after, wanting us to come to one of the first filming dates so they must have liked us.

I'll throw in my two cents.

1) If there's 1 things the Welsh love, it's drinking. And rugby. 2 things. Oh and singing.
If there's 3 things the Welsh love, it's drinking, rugby and singing. Especially all at the same time.
So come St.David's day, enjoying at least 2 of those is a must.
And welsh cakes. 4 things.

2) (northern) irish nationalism has always been a contentious, sometimes violent issue, fuelled by religious difference. Scottish nationalism has dominated the headlines recently due to some wanting independence. Wales has its own Assembly/local government which has done much to quell dissenting voices, but there are still many people who seem to believe Wales should separate from the UK. It's a touchy subject.

3) there is very little irish culture in the states from my experience, but a bizarre amalgamation of different Celtic cultures under the umbrella term 'irish' which is just an excuse to drink (which is great).
St.Patrick day corners the market in the public consciousness for a celtic celebration. Which is a shame, as the welsh impact on the US is hugely overlooked, from the huge mining communities, to much of New York's character (e.g Elis Island, Grand Central station) to many of the president who were from welsh stock (Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, even Obama apparently).

4) ""little nation""!? We're...perfectly formed, thankyouverymuch. 
Traditionally, the North is where welsh is more widely spoken. Having said that, I live in Cardiff and find myself speaking welsh a lot of the time as there's a strong welsh community here. Castles you'll find everywhere (I may be wrong but I think we have the most castles per square mile in the world). The beauty of being a ~~small~~ perfectly formed nation is everything is just a couple of hours drive away at most, whether its the mountains, the castles or the stunning coast.

So if you ever make it over here, let us know! The first 15 drinks are on us.

Iechyd da!

He rarely did this from what I remember? got any examples?

&gt;End balls are not necessarily chances created. I've seen Ibe on more than one occasion dribble past his men and lay it off to an open man who has continued play and not tried for the finish. That's an end ball and not necessarily a chance created.

That's not exactly a good end ball then is it? it's Ibe's job to create chances and score a few goals, he didn't do that this season.  If Ibe got past his defender then passed it back to someone like Henderson in space who then continues play I really don't see how exactly that's going to help us score? playing it back should be the last resort if there's no way to put in a good ball to a player in a good position.

I'm a teacher, and I teach kids not to rape every time I do sex ed. A shockingly high number of young people think that you can bring rape on yourself or that, once in a relationship, sex is an entitlement. Those attitudes don't just magically disappear when those young people turn 18, and given that the majority of rapes are committed by intimate partners, we can see what affect those attitudes have.

Teaching what consent is, and how to negotiate consent is teaching people not to rape. It might seem basic as fuck to you, but it's actually very widely misunderstood.

Some people retort that no one needs to be taught not to murder, but actually we do. The murder rate has fallen enormously over the last century and that's for a number of reasons including higher standards of living and *a greater respect for **all** human life* in society.

We're attempting to bring about a similar change, where there is a greater understanding of consent and bodily autonomy. We come from a legacy of women's bodies in particular being considered men's property and/or vessels for reproduction, and while 99% of the population don't believe women are property or vessels any more, there are vestiges of that way of thinking in our way of thinking.

In a successful turnover due to counterpress, the wingers start wide looking to cut in, and then the FB's comes forward.

It's still a problem in the midfield as Eriksen is not a terror defensively - I think Vert moves up a bit to help Mason choke off any midfield attacks, and Dier stays pinned back.  Hopefully they prevent far more breakaways than they allow.

It's high risk, but when you've got Lloris in the net, you get some breakaways cut off because of his sweeper keeping and general outstanding shot stopping.",null,0,null,1434213338,null,0,false,0,cs5cw9t,null,t3_39kj2z,null,t1_cs5cw9t,null,t3_39kj2z,null,null,null,1436967926,null,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0,null

I don't think you quite realise that the Free Mason conspiracy nonsense was part of his political ramblings. It wasn't dissident republicanism with a hobby of conspiracies on the side it was part and parcel of his political world view.

Here is an example of it:

&gt;Would any among our online community of friends and activists dispute the existence of a controlling one percent, a financial elite? That such a group exists has become accepted wisdom, with it also considered standard that within that one percent is a further one percent again.

&gt;This understanding and description of the so-called 'elite' today is shared by every strand of thinking from Marxists to anarchists and even to capitalists themselves. It could be no other way because at this point the evidence is undeniable.

&gt;But knowing such an elite exists - is real and holds vast power and the capacity to control others that goes with such power - would it really be a stretch of the imagination to assume such a group would form and abide by their own rules and regulations - their own 'ideology' if you will - itself to perpetuate their control and maintain their position as the elite?

&gt;For me it's the only logical conclusion to draw.

&gt;If we wish to get an idea of just what sort of ideological construct these sociopaths and predators would adhere to then look no further than occult Free Masonry. It's really the wood for the trees but then again that's what they depend on.

The majority of rapists aren't mad-eyed loons, they're normal people who have a messed up conception of what consent is. In sex ed we teach about what HIV is even though we know a tiny minority of kids will ever be in a high risk group for contracting HIV. In the same way, we teach about consent even though we know a relatively small number of kids will ever end up raping someone. When I do a lesson on addiction, I don't assume every child is an addict (which is the strange logic you seem to be following here), rather that addiction is something they may experience and face in a number of ways in their life. Consent and sex are things **everyone** has to deal with. It makes sense to teach about them.",null,0,null,1434215909,null,0,1434216371,0,cs5e51c,null,t3_39oxfc,null,t1_cs5e51c,null,t1_cs5dfpj,null,null,null,1436968801,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I abhorred Seinfeld and loved Friends, because I found the humour cheesy and predictable in both but Friends had decent acting and I cared about the characters enough to engage with the story lines. 

I never much liked the portrayal of Chandler's character in Friends and the fact that the actor obviously paused for laughter after delivering every line, but I could put up with it because I vaguely cared about the group dynamic and how he fit in to it . But to me Seinfeld was just a cast full of Chandlers without a reason for me to care. They weren't funny or likeable and they didn't even have good hairstyles.  Even in its most soap-like melodramatic moments Friends was still aesthetically pleasing. 

On the face of it the writing should be paramount, but for me the acting often matters more. I can find a joke hilarious delivered by one actor or nails on a chalkboard terrible delivered by another.

null,false,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,null,"Reading about what happens to lottery winners is really fascinating. I read something working out what indicates a lottery win will turn out good in the long, based on whether those people stayed wealthy and and what happened years down the line. Apparently if you don't go public it's far more likely for it to work out well for you. Having a small family helps and ironically the richer you are when you win the better it tends to work out.

There were all these crazy examples of how winning the lottery can actually mess up people's lives, they fall out with family members over it, get divorced, or get swindled out of the money or blow it all and end up broke. 

Apparently what you need to do is keep it as quiet as possible, don't go on ridiculous spending sprees, and make lots of trust funds. That is put a large amount for yourself in a trust, and then for every family member you want to share it with you create each of them a personal trust that will pay them every year. 

This ties the money up for both you and the people you give it to. Otherwise it's common for relatives to fall out years later when they've blown the first gift of money you gave them. Tying you own money up means you can't recklessly spend and if people come looking for hand outs you don't even have that money available. One thing people apparently do is when their relative gets super rich they come up with crazy business ideas, convince themselves of their workability and then expect the relative to foot the bill, it's much harder to reject something like that from a family member than simple asking for a huge sum of cash.

It's just fascinating to see the effects that a lot of money very fast has on people. People often fail to realise life is long and unpredictable, and you never know how being the super rich guy will affect that. Many naively believe that once they get rich all their worries are over, but it's surprising how things can fuck up even then.",null,0,null,1434217228,null,0,1434222335,0,cs5eseq,null,t3_39mw14,null,t1_cs5eseq,null,t3_39mw14,null,null,null,1436969320,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

That ranked alongside one of the more shocking facts we encountered.

We were warned that if she fucked up one more time, the lad would almost certainly be taken in to care since she was the primary caregiver. My brother, although not married to the mother, had a steady job and owned his own house, so we asked if he couldn't be named as the primary caregiver.

null,false,Jimmerhoft3rd,null,null,null,"I would recommend starting with episode one of Series 5 of the revival ""The Eleventh Hour"" because it's a good primer for the original run. Note, I'm not saying Series 5 on is perfect or better than any other era, I'm just going to explain why it has a bit more in common with the original run than it does with the first four series of the revival.

One of the biggest similarities between the two is that from Series 5 on, the show becomes more plot driven and the character work moves off to the side. The characters do grow and change (and not necessarily for the better) but that isn't placed front and center as often as it was in Series 1-4.

Another big similarity is the diversity in the stories it tells and the aesthetic it uses. Part of the show's longevity is that it hasn't been stuck in one particular style for too long. Different eras have had certain defining styles, like Base Under Siege, Universal/Hammer horror tropes and homages, sci-fi fantisy, etc. But even within the same era similar stories would be tackled different ways, one might be deadly serious, the other seriously funny. Now even though Series 5-7 get labeled as the fairy tale era, that's really only accurate for Series 5. In fact Series 7 which was the ""anniversary series"" had stories that in their general tone, harked back to different eras in the show's long history. For example; a story called ""The Power of Three"" is very much a RTD-era story, another called ""Cold War"" is very much a second Doctor B.U.S type story.

Now for the most obvious difference. From 2005 on, the show has mostly featured stories told in a single 45-minute episode, with the occasional two-parter (and even one three part story). From 1963-1989 (i.e. the original run) stories were told in a multi-episode/serial format. So you would watch a single story over the course of several weeks (usually 4 weeks). The episode lengths were also shorter (mostly 25 minutes).

Finally two things about jumping in to the original run.
1) Since the show was made before the video age, it was expected that these episodes would only be seen once. So to help keep the show accessible to new viewers, most stories can be seen cold. But the easiest jumping on points will be the first or second of a new companion. Since the character needs to be told what's going on, it allows the production team at the time to tell new viewers what the show is all about.
2) With a show this long running there's a lot of mythology that's been established, and these ""rules"" have affected decisions the revival has made. But during the original run the mythology was much more fluid and even contradictory, so you don't need to worry about knowing much mythology before starting, in fact forgetting what you hear/learn in the revival before starting the original run is probably a good idea.",null,0,null,1434218709,null,0,false,0,cs5fj00,null,t3_39oqyt,null,t1_cs5fj00,null,t3_39oqyt,null,null,null,1436969794,null,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2,null

But wouldn't that be a culture, or maybe a subculture in and of itself? 

Like you point out, this mindset was imported from Pakistan where it's apparently considered if not normal then broadly tolerated to take non-muslim girls and turn them into sex slaves. 

Are there rape cultures? Sure (the US prison system, where the term was appropriated from immediately springs to mind), is the broader UK one of them? No, I don't believe so. But I think the confluence of factors in these cases Rochdale, Rotherham etc could be argued that a rape culture was allowed to develop. 

That said, I utterly hate the term. Firstly it was appropriated from a very specific cause, with the people who were affected utterly dismissed by those doing the appropriating.

Liverpool delegates were watching the match between Croatia and Italy,and the main reason wasn't the game but Mateo Kovacic.

The only thing that remains for Reds is to talk to Croatian representative, for whom they've reportedly bid 22.6 million euros,plus two millions of some extra.

The club from Anfield finds Kovacic to be the perfect replacement for Steven Gerrard who has left for LA Galaxy.Inter wasn't playing well during last season,but the Croatian has scored 5 times and assisted 3,meaning he was one of the main players in Mancini's team.

Even though Liverpool has already signed three new players such as James Milner,Danny Ings and Adam Bogdan,the supporters would certainly be happier if Kovacic were to play at Anfield next season.

There are mistakes,but i tried to be quick.

Miazga also starts for the New York Red Bulls and I'm sure CC-V could handle an MLS attack.

I'd really like him to find a loan somewhere next season

Lets say if we point our camera at a criminal then the system flags them 100% accurately. 100% true positives. 0% false negatives. Well go 100% true negatives. If the system says you are innocent then you absolutely are. I hope you'll agree that is sufficiently generous.

Now we can look at the false positive rate.

Now we can take figures from [this PDF study of automated passport controls](http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Research/Biopass_Study_II.pdf) which provides a false rejection rate of between 4.25% and 5.2%. In our system this would be flagging someone as a criminal when they are not.

Now lets be clear: These scenarios are not the same. When I get scanned at a passport control, it is in my personal interest for the system to correctly identify me. I'm aware it's going on. I don't remember if I have to take off my glasses or not, but I do whatever is required to make it work. The environment is optimised as much as possible for accurate recognition. What I'm not doing is looking away. Jumping up and down. Yelling. Dancing. Wearing funky clothes, loud make-up, hats or sunglasses.

But we are stacking the odds. Take the lower number and run the calculation.

    120,000 * 0.0425 = 5,100 false positives
    91 true positives
    91 / 5191 = 0.0175

null,false,f1v3-4c3s,null,null,null,"If you can convince your sister to do it, then the best course of action for her might be to create a voluntary discretionary settlement.  That is a big if, but I have seen people who know they are really bad with money do this with their inheritance.  It stops them overspending, but adds a new problem that they now constantly argue with the trustee (the person appointed by the voluntary settlement).

In this setup, whoever was the trustee (say a solicitor specialising in trusts or a trust company) would have power to decide how much your sister received and when.  The trustee could decide to pay her the income generated as and when it is received, or they could decide to pay her nothing regularly, but make one off larger payments for more important items in her life when she requests them.

The downsides are:

* The solicitor's or trust company's services cost money, often quite a lot.  So the amount being settled needs to be decent to absorb these costs, but even in the long run costs will use up some of her money.
* There might be some tax consequences.  The less she already owns the less these would be.
* The trustee might not have a strong enough will to say no to her.  This can happen if she calls/visits them every day/week until she gets her way.  You could be one of the trustees if she trusts you enough, but then you could be in a position where you have to constantly say no which strains your relationship.
* You usually want to have more than one person named as the beneficiary of a discretionary settlement, but be careful about adding her children, as they might try to get money out of the settlement (see above re a strong willed trustee).

Just a reminder, your sister would have to meet the solicitor who is drawing up the deed, the solicitor would have to explain to her that she was losing control of her own money and that she doesn't have to this.  Then she would have to voluntarily sign the settlement deed and agree to this.",null,0,null,1434222181,null,0,false,0,cs5h7ny,null,t3_39pji5,null,t1_cs5h7ny,null,t3_39pji5,null,null,null,1436971096,null,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4,null

Martinez is gone, we should have bid but we didn't. If Aubameyang decides he wants to leave Dortmund then almost every top club in Europe will be after him etc.. our only hope in that list is Remy. And after what happened with Sturridge it would be silly of them to let him to go us unless it's a silly amount of money.

The reason Monty Hall isn't applicable here is because the Monty Hall problem askes for the contestant to choose 1 of 3 boxes (1 with the prize and 2 duds). it features a host that opens a losing box for the contestant and then offers the chance to switch. If you hold the other losing box (2/3 probability since you selected at random when there were 3 boxes) then that means the host has eliminated the other losing box, meaning switching will guarantee victory as the final box must be the prize, If you hold the winning box (1/3 probability) obviously switching will lose. So by switching you have a probability of 2/3 of winning (since that is the probability of holding a losing box to begin with), and by the law that says all possible probabilities must add up to 1 that means sticking would give you a 1/3 probability of winning.

In DOND Noel Edmonds doesn't have any insider knowledge and so the above scenario is not applicable since Noel doesn't reveal a losing box to the contestant.

And which state approved politicians want me to see private property and the capitalist mode of production as past its usefulness and in need of total replacement? Which is the one that wanted me to view the state and its enforcement as propping up capitalism and in need of being wiped clean? Or the one that wanted me to not see electoral politics as the primary means of social change?

&gt; enlighten me please with your views on local politics in regards to Stormont, power sharing and the GFA.

All the Stormont parties are a waste of time and only perpetuate the conditions that keep them elected and in their cushy position. Powersharing holds back progress and ensures everything stays in stalemate. The GFA helped bring some peace to the place and is welcome in that respect but it hasn't completely solved the problems here just calmed them for now and the Stormont parties are fairly content to pretend it's all fixed.

NI needs an independent cross community working class movement that being very optimistic could arise from organising resistant to the latest austerity measures. It needs something that could bring together the two sides to fight for their common interests for once. The national question comes secondary to these things. If Bosnia can unite its ethnic groups to fight the state, austerity and politicians who try to keep them apart for electoral gain despite the recent memories of genocide then NI can do it too.",null,0,null,1434225060,null,0,false,0,cs5ikb9,null,t3_39ai0t,null,t1_cs5ikb9,null,t1_cs5hvsu,null,null,null,1436972111,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

Legal highs are incredibly easy to get your hands on, horribly addictive and mind and life destroying. A sweeping ban has the potential - and probably will be, knowing this government - to be abused to mean just about anything on a whim, yes, but these things are evil. 

At least with illegal drugs you know what you're getting into. These things change their formulas six times a month, becoming stronger and stronger each time, leaving users - often with serious mental health issues to begin with - stuck in a cycle of addiction and fear with no available help whatsoever because medical professionals will not touch them as they have no idea what they really consist of. With known drugs there are almost always ways of getting help to get off of them but no one will even know where to begin assessing a patient who has an addiction to an unknown substance. 

They have blown up huge over the past few years to the point where they are openly sold in two or three shops in every major town in the country. It is genuinely a serious problem and banning these things one by one clearly hasn't worked because they just get replaced by something worse. 

Too many people on reddit are saying ""hurr hurr the government is putting a blanket ban on fun"" without realising how many lives are actually being destroyed as a result of these things.

Yes, 100%. I'm Irish, so I have always heard the stereotype that we are all drunks etc, but to be honest I see no difference in drinking culture between the two countries. Any town or city on a Friday/Saturday night, any holiday resort where Irish/British people go, any social event like the office party, people get absolutely shitfaced drunk in a way you don't see in other countries.

It seems people essentially think they can't have a good time without a drink. It's the cliché but if you go out in Italy or France, you see a café culture where people sit and talk... sober. Now obviously they have their own party animals who get smashed too, I'm not saying it's a utopia. But the UK/Ireland are next level.

And that's not even touching on chronic alcohol drinking throughout life, like a 6 pack a night.

That being said, I don't think Sharp is the answer to our goalscoring problems either. If Doukara can find his form again then I think he'll do well at this level, but it all depends on his willingness to put the effort in. Sharp got himself back into the starting XI by scoring goals.

The brutal advice for your personal finances would be never loan out money, not even to family or friends.  It's asking for trouble.

You should also download a finances app to your smart phone.  I did this 3 years ago and it has completely changed my finances.  Log every purchase as soon as you pay for it, put each purchase in categories (groceries, rent, mobile contract, electricity bill etc).

People will still hold property offshore (for estate planning, privacy, ease of admin etc.) but now HMRC will generate extra tax from it. 

For the beneficial owner of the property they will also incur a number of extra costs, the tax reporting could be 4/500+ a year, plus they have to get the house valued every so often so it could put a number of relatively but not super rich people off.

There are also a number of reasonable-ish exemptions, like for buy to let properties and ATED completely ignores commercial property. I expect a number of the properties in the article would be buy to let and what not.

It is also worth noting that properties can be held in an offshore trust, and then there's no ATED charge, capital gains or inheritance tax (although, to confuse the matter somewhat, trusts have a tax charge at the 10 year anniversary). At any rate HMRC are getting tougher on assets held in trusts, so that will likely change.

In all seriousness,  what I'm trying to do with the above sentence is make you see depression in a different light. It genuinely is a chemical imbalance in the brain, and doctors are able to effectively treat it in the majority of cases. The horrible thing about it though, is that because the issue is related to the brain, the depression affects the ability to reason about it.

Doctors (in my experience) are incredibly understanding and supportive with regards to depressive illnesses. They definitely can't tell your employer, and will not get you locked away.

60% of retailers will close shop by 2017? that doesn't sound excessive at all.

&gt; Even in the “best case scenario” there will be 8,073 fewer shops in two years time, putting 80,000 jobs at risk on the basis that the British Retail Consortium report assumes each shop closure costs 10 jobs.

Ass- assumes? can we at least know based on what? is it the average number of employees per shop plus the estimated number of connected jobs lost in other businesses (logistics etc.)?

&gt; The current business rates system is unsustainable

Based on what reasoning? the piece says that if this many shops close we'd lose this many jobs, it says literally nothing about the effect of taxation on how likely these shops are to close.

&gt; Since 2008, pre-tax profits for the largest retailers have fallen 32pc but their business rates bill has grown by 27pc.

27pc of what? of previous value? is it inflation adjusted? is it normalized for number of shops or economic size of the sector?

I agree, but I do think there is an underlying issue 

&gt;Since 2008, pre-tax profits for the largest retailers have fallen 32pc but their business rates bill has grown by 27pc.

This is where my economics falls down, but couldn't your argument be used against the 32pc downfall. 

I'm reading it as a basic profit/cost analyse? 

Edit: I think I'm trying to say, if profit margins are already so low in the high street which is widely reported, then a decrease in sales and an increase in costs is a bad thing? 

Everyone is bemoaning the collapse of the high street as it is, this scenario isn't helping.

You are unlikely to be put into inpatient treatment unless you're in a very bad way and have little to no support system. 

I would very strongly advise telling someone you're close with about what's going on. You don't have to be particularly specific but it is a good idea to have someone else be aware that you are starting treatment. My first attempt at anti-depressants fucked me up a *lot*. They can make you more suicidal. Be aware of possible side effects before you put any chemicals in your body and know that there are a lot of different pills you can take. If you feel they're not helping or are having a negative effect on you go back to your GP and they'll give you a different prescription. 

It might also be worthwhile to research charities or organisations in your area who might be able to find you counselling a lot quicker than the NHS can. 

Again, I *strongly* advise you to talk to your GP just be aware that it isn't an instant fix and there are risks with starting any treatment, try not to go it alone and don't wait until you're in crisis to seek help. 

Also, if you've never spoken to anyone about this before, try writing things down before you go.

null,false,Vikingstein,null,null,null,"Women in fact are not paid less than men. The median average income between women and men is higher for men, but that's an average. If we look at that average the gap is actually against men between the 22-29 age and the 30-39 age. The reason for the gap is due to very high earners on the male side, of which there are more, but in general women are not paid less than men.

Women may have more reported cases of sexual assault, however a lot of rape against men goes unreported due to the stigma and higher levels of men incarcerated where there is a real problem with rape. I do believe that even if more men reported rape women would still have more of a problem than men, however it's not privilege to not be raped. Sexual assault, is again something that we're not going to be able to get away from. It falls under the same boat as many other crimes like murder,victims of which btw men make up 69%. 

I will agree with casual sexism, there's a lot of nasty lad culture these days, but again I wouldn't so much call it privilege as just people being bad people, both sides do it.

I live in the West of Scotland, where I live you're a lot more likely to be stopped and searched if you wear a pair of trackies. Around here we have a very little population of BME, however that doesn't stop there being mass poverty and less opportunities, at a store that opened near me there was something like 1000 CVs for like 85 jobs.

These are problems, real problems, however I don't think it's quite as simple as your race that dictates your future, it all comes down to the gap between the poor, the middle class and the rich. We can't solve the problems for BME people or woman if we're jumping down each others throats calling each other privileged in some way or another, which is what it would eventually come to, we need to as egalitarians fight against the super rich who don't pay taxes, the companies that don't pay minimum wage, the politicians who are on their friends paychecks to push through things that hurt everyone but them. 

Privilege to me seems like a concept to distract us, to give us reasons why some people are treated the way they are. The real reasons are sitting in parliament, or in one of there nice houses in London.  Economic advantage is real privilege, anyone can be born into a rich household, the numbers may be higher for white people, but nothing can be done about it until we do something about the real problem.",null,0,null,1434232359,null,0,false,0,cs5m1n6,null,t3_39oxfc,null,t1_cs5m1n6,null,t1_cs5he5e,null,null,null,1436974785,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

&gt;Are you a republican?

In favour of a socialist republic but only as an means to a stateless end. I don't identify which what is usually called republican here but  

&gt;If so, are you opposed to armed struggle

Yes. It is nothing but counter productive to class struggle. Individualist terror does nothing but create a vicious cycle of polarising violence and increased state repression.

&gt;We're not in Bosnia, were in the occupied 6 counties of Ireland, where we have one of the most complex political situations in the world, so don't compare us to others please, stay in the confines of the Irish coast.

I'd argue Bosnia is more complex. They have a power sharing system too put in place after the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Incidentally Clinton was involved in both. They share power three ways within a dysfunctional state where nothing can get done and each side stokes up ethnic tensions come election time to ensure they get voted back in to keep themuns out. It gets them nowhere and the place became a basket case. Rather than Irish v British, Catholic v Protestant it's Bosniak v Serb v Croat and Muslim v Orthodox v Catholic. Just to add to it their conflict was shorter but far more bloody with actual ethnic cleansing taking place. Things were done that are a lot harder to forgive and forget than what took place here. 

Last year the people had enough of their bullshit and privatisations and burned down government buildings, kicked the police out, created popular assemblies and presented their demands to the government. Quite a few of them have since been fulfilled. It was an explicitly cross community effort. Just twenty years ago they were killing each other in their tens of thousands.

Bosnia is about the only situation out there in any way comparable to that of the north and it just adds to the argument Marxists have had for years that you need to unite working people on class issues if you are going to overcome these divisions and get anything done for the working class.",null,0,null,1434232369,null,0,false,0,cs5m1t5,null,t3_39ai0t,null,t1_cs5m1t5,null,t1_cs5jxoz,null,null,null,1437556315,null,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1,null

I can't recall any recent incidents of victims being blamed in the UK, if there are they are a minority and would be condemned by the majority. I am sure they are a few chauvinists around who would victim blame when out of ear range of a few. But does this make a 'culture'? The word culture suggests its something of significant traction. I don't see that. The type who would victim blame are dwindling and its an old view. Compare how far we have come over the past few decades. You can see that clearly.

I don't now where to go with that....This I would guess is porn? If more porn is around, more women would be raped. Well that has not been proven to be true.

null,false,easyjet,null,null,null,"OK slightly different view. My company used them (in Wilmslow) for recruiting a sales person. We needed a certain type and they offered an alternative to 'normal' recruiters.

By a very weird coincidence my company was two doors down from theirs (I think they have moved since) - we were on Alderley Road I think.

We were invited to watch the process via video - at least a few hours of it. I saw about 1.5 hours of it. 

There were about 12 candidates in a room and they were given certain tasks - individual and team. One of them was one I heard years ago when I worked at the BBC - you are all given 'occupations' - eg. Joiner, Doctor, Binman and told that only half of you can get on the last plane to an island where you will be saved from the impending end of civilisation. You have to decide who gets on and why. The process is more important than the result and most candidates don't spot that - all being eager beaver young sales types they want to be on the plane, despite their occupation.

Anyway, it actually seemed that the candidates enjoyed it - well they didnt hate it. The position we were offering was well paid for the right person. (we didnt recruit from this batch). 

So the facts are that they dont just recruit for shady door to door types, it will depend on the hiring client. We were serious - and I think we ultimately on this occasion went elsewhere.

This was 10 years ago I think (2006 probably).

Definitely not just cowboy jobs, remember they arent the client/employer, they're recruiters who actually give both client and candidate a different way to learn about each other.

Personally, I think you can learn everything about someone from seeing what happens when they have to deal with an unexpected flat tyre. I have been reprimanded by HR on several occasions for driving new recruits around for days on end hoping for a puncture.",null,0,null,1434235809,null,0,false,0,cs5noaq,null,t3_39m5ar,null,t1_cs5noaq,null,t1_cs4pb3b,null,null,null,1436976033,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

&gt;**However, younger adults were much more likely to binge drink than older people.** Almost a quarter (24 per cent) of men aged 16 to 24 admitted drinking more than eight units of alcohol in a single day, as did 25 per cent of those aged 25 to 44.

The reason I say this is because pace, dribbling, or power shots were tricks Soldado didn't show in his time in Valencia. He is a world class poacher, no doubt about it. He scored some amazing goals in La Liga, and I think he can do it again if he regains confidence. But his ability to score relied heavily on a midfield and wings that could provide quality service.

""We all felt it was the right time to go—we'd given it all we could—but at the same time we all knew there would be nothing else we'd ever do that would be quite like this. You might have real success doing something else, you'll work on other things, but whatever happens this is unique. There's nothing else like Doctor Who. In the world.

And to be fair, drunk people so don't look attractive or intelligent in any way. When I see them around, not a single bone in my body thinks ""yeah, I want to be like that!"". Not judging people for liking something I don't like, just saying, not my thing. 

I didn't grow up in The UK though, where I grew up people tend to go for a drink - often quite early - and sit around sipping the same glass of whatever they are having for hours whilst chatting.

null,false,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,null,"&gt;  Losing Gerrard will impact the team in a fairly sizeable way that we can't see right now

I think Gerrard's decline severely damaged our campaign this year. I think 13/14 near miss on the title killed whatever drive he had left here. It was evident he didn't come back the same player to this season and often was a glaring weakness.

He was eventually shoe-horned out of the squad and we looked better for it. Then he announced he was leaving and his farewell tour began. So many pressure filled games about doing it for Gerrard, all while the rest of the team was bent around fitting him in despite him being a weak link. It obviously had to be done, but it it was not good for the team. 

Emotionally and performance wise, I think Gerrard had a big negative impact on the club this year. He obviously has our internal gratitude, but we had already lost him last season, we just didn't know it. 

I think  actually having a fresh start without him now will lift some of the weight that's been on the team. We will obviously miss his aura, and presence, but I do think it was the right time to go. I wish he had retired and stayed close to the club, but he's earned a paid holiday in America.

A side note about goals. I really do like Ings. I just see big things for him. He has all the right qualities to be a great striker, and I think if given a chance this season, he will properly establish himself. I think he can get between 10-15 goals next season.",null,0,null,1434243255,null,0,1434245744,0,cs5r0ob,null,t3_39pgo0,null,t1_cs5r0ob,null,t1_cs59cuh,null,null,null,1436978726,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null
