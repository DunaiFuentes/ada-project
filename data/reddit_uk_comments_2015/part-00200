This legislation though completely misses the total re-evaluation of drug policy that's needed. Why is ecstasy, a drug provably safer than alcohol after decades of research, considered a class A drug alongside heroin? And why are cocaine and crack cocaine both classed the same, when one is clearly more damaging in every way?

I'm generally against the full legalisation of drugs. I have enough experience to know that all drugs have damaging effects (so does paracetamol, after all, and I wouldn't recommend taking that for pleasure) but blanket bans that prevent all medical and therapeutic effects is barbaric, when there are so many potential benefits to the use of many of these drugs.

The use of psychoactive substances should be decided by doctors, not ignorant politicians. If someone is already taking a drug, better the supplier be a doctor's prescription than a criminal gang. It's safer for the user and cuts off the criminals from profits. 

Merely approaching your doctor to ask for something will dissuade the straight and naive from getting into something they've never tried before. Meanwhile they'll be able to prescribe the correct drugs for treatment of addicts, PTSD sufferers, those with cronic pain, etc, and guide them through rehabilitation.

And those asking the doctor for more dangerous drugs could be persuaded to switch to safer ones. Drugs should be a public health issue, not a political one.",null,0,null,1432785219,null,0,false,0,crnazhb,null,t3_37ig37,null,t1_crnazhb,null,t3_37ig37,null,null,null,1433308469,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

What I do object to is the specific example of this specific person and her specific approach to this issue.

I see what you mean about worries of an overzealous police/justice system could stifle civil liberties and civil progress. 

But we've had telephone tapping for a long time, and I would guess that police are allowed to look through snail mail after production of a warrant (citation needed!).

Does this mean you'd be comfortable with a Snooper's charter that had to be accessed using warrants and probably cause? This way the police wouldn't have instant omniscient access - but something similar to older surveillance techniques that we afford them.

What do you reckon?

null,false,lamby,null,null,null,"&gt; It's completely reasonable to ban creationism from being taught as science because it isn't science. We wouldn't let somebody teach MacBeth as a faithful record of history or use a 15th century map to teach geography either.

Well, teaching from a 15th-century map—however incorrect—would enjoy an interesting and envigorating perspective on the world and would brilliantly demonstrate how, why, and the struggle it took to know we we know now, surely a fundamental lesson in science.

But even that's a distraction - you're making the mistake of seeing the issue as a question of fact (ie. whether you think X is a valid description of the world), rather than on the principle of allowing a government to decide what is historical or philosophical truth. If it helps, a concrete example of what happens if you let the state decide what we ""wouldn't let"" children be exposed to is [Section 28](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28).

There's always something counter-productive about stemming the free flow of ideas anyway. I don't know about you, but if I was told that I wasn't allowed to learn about something in a class that would be the absolutely first thing I would look up and give it more weight and credit as a result.

As I hinted in my previous message, we must really think extremely little of today's children if we think they need protection in this way, as well as it being insultingly infantilising.

I mean there's obviously a balance to be made. I don't want people being spied on for no reason, so restrict surveillance, but I don't want terrorists blowing us up so there should be surveillance of those who are a risk of certain crimes (such as killing/maiming/large theft etc), but then I don't want every Muslim man aged 16-50 under surveillance, so there has to be a REAL probable cause. 

It's very tricky, obviously or it would be easy. But what I'm talking about in my comment before is the reason that you can't just say ""oh well it doesn't matter, only criminals will feel the ill effects."". As in the idea that passive surveillance doesn't harm society, it only harms those who break the law. I think it DOES harm society, even at low levels, but that you need to allow some of that harm to prevent other harms, like bombings etc. 

I think CCTV in the streets prevents a lot of people doing things they would otherwise like to do, that don't harm other people *(I'll keep going back to weed not because I'm a massive stoner or anything, but because I think it's a fairly well understood issue whereby we have something banned that doesn't harm others and that people enjoy and provides some benefits to society (whether it's a net benefit is up to peoples view) but that people can't do as much as they'd like because of the law and threat of punishment.)*. I think that the police infiltrating numerous peaceful protest groups restricts the things that people say at those groups, and so stifles the discussion of how our society should evolve. I think the police bringing cameras to protests and often publicly showing the tapes prevents people going to peaceful protests. But I think that CCTV helps prevent knife crime, I think certain groups certainly do need keeping an eye on, and I think it makes sense to film a situation that might get violent, especially when the police might need to use force on civilians..... So it's not as clear cut as ban all CCTV/wire-tapping, or blanket the streets with CCTV/tap all the phones. Both options harm us in different ways, and we have to constantly strive for the choices that do least harm, and alter them as the fluid situation changes

As long as we understand that it is a trade and a balance of two harms, and not just a bit of annoyance being given for safety, then we can make a proper discussion as a country and hopefully a proper decision.",null,0,null,1432791144,null,0,false,0,crnd90r,null,t3_37j6eu,null,t1_crnd90r,null,t1_crnc2r0,null,null,null,1433309608,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Most Improved - Zaha, things turned around as soon as he chose to stay with us. Brings energy and versatility just about every time comes out.

The Freddie Sears Award for Most Bitterly Disappointing Player - Yaya SaNoGoal, a physically imposing player that cannot make a decent first touch to save his life.

The Johnny Ertl Award for Most Underrated Player - Dann, aka Dann the mann. Bruised but never battered, capable of magical headers, and exactly what you want a center back to be- reliable and consistent.

Goal of the Season -  
For: Puncheon free kick gem vs Man U
Against: Matty Phillips (QPR)

High Point of the Season - The Sunderland win, at that point I felt we were unstoppable. ""It's like watching Brazil!""

Low Point of the Season - Going into Christmas in the drop zone and with no real plan to work our way out.

The Liverpool Award for Favourite Opponents - Lester City. 

The Yannick Bolasie Award for Favourite Bit of Outrageous Skill - Yala is one of those special breeds that can't really shoot or pass, but is pure entertainment when he chooses to dangle.

Yes, this was disgraceful. Perhaps many left-wing supporters hail from Tony Blair's open-door policy on immigration - and many of them have no ties to Britain's past. Maybe none of them have grandfathers who fought in a war to protect Britain. So why should they respect the history of a country that gave them what they have now?

&gt; Should a moderate right-wing party leader be seen in a public house enjoying a Sunday lunch with his young daughters, that gives the extreme left (sorry, I mean hard right) an excuse to scare his children off with an outrageous display of terror and intimidation.

Sadly this has become acceptable behaviour. Even in my IT office at a higher end global institution we had one guy spouting off the f-word repeatedly when describing UKIP supporters - even though they make up the third greatest block of voters in the country.

We don't even blink twice when there are mass strikes, student protests involving criminality and criminal damage, and the London riots of 2011 were largely swept under the carpet, too.

The threats made against UKIP have made me wonder what would have happened if he would have been murdered. I think #jesuisUKIP is appropriate and I would print such a t-shirt and wear it.

&gt; Bahar, the disgraced 27-year-old who claims to represent diversity at some shit East London university student union, excludes men, and especially heterosexual white men, from her political nonsensical lectures.

Some kid can use the n-word in reference to an obscenely wealthy black footballer and go to prison. Yet an Asian person in a position of responsibility can promote the genocide of white people and... nothing? Doesn't even lose that position? Or get kicked out of university? When a lengthy prison term was entirely justified?

I agree with you 100%.

null,false,rockinghorseshit,null,null,null,"Hi! Glad you are looking forward to coming over to Scotland and good on ya for being very prepared ahead of time. So April in Scotland can still be pretty brutal. You can easily expect there to be snow as low as say 600m and it can still be very cold wet and windy. The best resource for forecasts and such is the Mountain Weather Information Service (MWIS) just google it, can't link I'm on my phone sorry. 

As for your jacket, I didn't look at the link but basically you are going to want something that can withstand a serious amount of rain otherwise your going to have a bad time. I know you want to fast and light but this also means (I'm guessing) you want to keep rolling regardless of the weather? In which case you'll need a gortex or event (or paramo if you have the cash) fabric which will breathe. I'd look at ultralight gear UK (website) for some starters or if you want to buy in Glasgow try Cotswolds, go outdoors, tiso, blacks or nevisport. They'll give you good advice there, about other stuff too.

Footwear. Ah jeez. The WHW is pretty rough. Most do it in leather/synthetic walking boots- because as you said, rain on your feet is a problem but also Scotland has a looooooot of surface water. That means mud and bogs, pal! So again a comfortable waterproof shoe is probably pretty high priority, especially in April. If your feet get wet on day 1 and don't dry out you will have a very bad time. So yeah consider a walking boot unless you are really trying to gun it and maybe get a walking/trail running shoe but you'll loose the ankle support and like I said it's tough terrain, and with a heavy pack that's asking for injury really. As for your shoes for the rest of Europe, are you sticking in cities, if so then just trainers will be fine. Avoid wellies at all costs, they are for farmers and shooters not distance walkers- you'll rub raw!

Running shorts may be a good idea while walking as you'll be hot but some fast drying outdoors trousers and a waterproof over-shell are pretty important. Scotland will make you her little bitch if you aren't careful haha, and it can get cold at night.

Your sleeping bag and pad sound fine, and I think a stove is a good idea for morale of anything. Have you considered making an alcohol/penny stove? I've made a really simple one and successfully made tea and even cooked on it. I burn surgical spirit on it, which you can get from Boots (pharmacy) 

As for your tent, look at Terra nova. They make excellent gear designed for the UK. Very reputable company. Something like the laser 1 man would be good.

Any more questions feel free to ask dude!

What they are trying to do is making it a legal requirement for ISPs and phone providers to record certain metadata for them for 12 months; the argument is that they are interested in who is talking to who rather than the content of any communication.  (That comes later...)  i.e. it's the difference between 'show me all telephone numbers that xxx has called in the last 12 months' rather than 'give me the recordings of all xxx's phone calls'.  This is a **whopping** difference, however still an invasion of privacy.  They kind of already did this with RIPA back in 2000.

I'm not defending it, but it is often blown way out of proportion, mainly because a lot of what they want to do actually isn't possible so long as the services in question are using encryption.

For example, Facebook uses SSL encryption by default.  Your ISP can only see that it's routing Facebook traffic to your house - they cannot see the contents of that traffic without tampering with your actual computer (specifically they would have to install a root CA certificate into your computer's trust store to get your computer to trust the spoofed certificates they would be generating when pretending to be Facebook.  This is not difficult to detect if you know where and how to look).  They could however see anything you published publicly by simply searching for you on Facebook like anyone else.  I am curious as to how exactly they plan on finding out who you are messaging on services like Facebook as they simply will not be able to see that data so long as everything is using SSL.

Despite having a beard and hanging out at a Mosque very occasionally (to practice my Arabic) - It turns out that I am a freelance web developer who used to run a small business organising 4x4 and climbing expeditions to the Sahara and other places.  I am luckily very white.

My problem is that I *KNOW* I was ""watched"" and probably still am due to a load of circumstantial evidence against me.  What I don't like the idea of is that I am automatically electronically tagged and investigated as a potential terrorist by a machine because, due to my life style, I have had all sorts of red flags thrown up.

One or more private companies compete for government business, no problem.  A private company sells a product or service to the government, and the company makes money, no problem.

A private company pays a government official to award them a contract, vary the contract terms, or gain some other benefit.  That's a bribe. Big problem.

(the similar kinds of rules can also apply when a private company puts a job out to tender, asking other companies to bid to do the work).

Obviously, there are grey areas,  at a minimum for example say 2 friends (one government official, one contractor) go out after work, and 1 buys a round of drinks for both.   Or what if the company wants to reimburse  an official to visit an important business meeting - but what if the meetings in Bermuda, etc.?   To avoid even the appearance of impropriety, there are often limits on gifts and reporting rules in large organizations and government in such situations.   But I don't think we are talking about grey areas here - it's alleged that millions of dollars were being distributed to various people in return for things, in other words bribes.

You're not using your imagination if you don't see how this can apply.

Here's a fictional example:

Imagine the government is building a new airport.

Person G is a minor government official who is involved in the design of the runways.

Person P works for a construction firm C.

Person P talks to person G, and gets him to vary the specification of the runway design so that construction firm C is pretty much guaranteed to win the contract.   He pays G a large sum of cash to do so. .  

After company C wins the contract, person P &amp; G then starting over-charging the government for various costs.  Again G is bribed using C's money, and and now G shares some of the bribe money with P personally.

So P &amp; G are both enriched at the expense of the government, and possibly partially at the expense of C too.",null,0,null,1432798592,null,0,1432798981,0,crnfjjn,null,t3_37fbfb,null,t1_crnfjjn,null,t1_crn5llm,null,null,null,1433310688,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

I see your points, and I totally understand where you're coming from. It's a view I've seen from quite a few (although probably not a majority) of people who are well informed on these topics.

 I agree that it doesn't change things that far away from what they are at the moment (although, I'd say there's a slight difference between knowing a letter can be opened in transit or a phone can be tapped with authority, and metadata from any of your online actions over the past 12 months can be accessed by more people, presumably with less trouble). 

However, there are a few things that have changed because it was concluded that ""the way they are at the moment"" was a violation of human rights (e.g. EU Data Retention directive). Are you specifically in favour of these new laws, or just impartial?

I feel your view (and partially mine) is almost a little defeatist though: *""I already have no privacy, so this won't change anything""* sort of mindset. Nothing wrong with that: I agree with it to some extent, but I've been raised and told my entire life never do anything on the Web (or phone/letter) that you wouldn't be happy with your nan seeing on the front page of the news the next day, and so try conduct myself accordingly. 

However, opponents of surveillance laws might argue that, actually, the fact that me and you already (potentially) conduct ourselves differently under the pretence of surveillance is evidence that impinging on our privacy is directly affecting our freedom and expression. 

Although some might argue the sacrifice of some privacy is necessary or justifiable, in the name of creating a safer society/children/freedom/buzzword.

The moral dilemma though is how much do you tolerate someones freedom to be, for example, a racist?  Do you call them out about it? or do you just silently tut and go on your way?  Personally I will call them out about it as I would any sort of anti social behavior, including defacing war memorials. 

Now, if UKIP doesn't (rightly or wrongly) want to be perceived as a racist, homophobic and sexist organisation, it is up to them to change their image.   So far in UKIP's brief history, it would seem that they court approval and support from this type of bigotry rather than reject it.  It is up to UKIP to attract candidates that even if they hold these views, they are at least bright enough to keep them to themselves.  

Unfortunately, until UKIP is shown to be a bit more ""caring and sharing"" and intelligent, the general public, my self included, will see it as little more than a bigoted far right organisation that appeals to the lowest common denominator.  And that, quite frankly worries me as much as the far left does and deserves to be called out.

More annoyed at Labour's lack of response to this and the media who has decided to focus on the EU ref over minor increase in wages after 13 years.  Major U turn on the anti business line. Tories have waited so long before acting great just great yet nobody going to say a word. 

Anything this is why people get turned off you demonize a policy but do it.  Don't say Labour had a good policy lets borrow it or allow any real debate.  

This is a drop in the ocean compared to what is required to repair the damage done to wages.  Bitter sweet victory in my eyes.

&gt;

&gt;A __joke__ is something spoken, written, or done with [humorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour) intention.  Jokes may have many different forms, e.g., a single word or a gesture (considered in a particular context), a question-answer, or a whole [short story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story). The word ""joke"" has [a number of synonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:joke), including *wisecrack*, [gag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag), [prank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prank), [quip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quip), [jape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jape) and *jest*.  To achieve their end, jokes may employ [irony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony), [sarcasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm), [word play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_play) and other devices. Jokes may have a [punch line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_line), i.e., an ending to make it humorous.

&gt;A [practical joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke) or prank differs from a spoken joke in that the major component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example placing salt in the sugar bowl).

null,false,lgf92,null,null,null,"Your American undergraduate law degree probably won't count here as a qualifying degree for legal study, meaning you'll have to study two qualifications: the GDL (Graduate Diploma in Law, a one year crash course of English and EU law and general jurisprudence) or the LPC (Legal Practice Course, the standard pre-qualification course for solicitors). This takes two years and is quite expensive unless you've secured a training contract with a company which will pay for it. 

You then do a two-year traineeship at a law firm as a trainee solicitor and after this time has passed you can apply to the SRA to become a solicitor officially. 

That's assuming you want to be a solicitor - remember in the UK we have two main separate legal professions: solicitors, who generally represent their clients' interests outside of court (legal advice, contracts, dispute resolution, purchasing etc) and carry some of the functions of a notary public; and barristers, who argue their clients' cases in court. Solicitors were given new powers in 1990 to speak in courts and they can gain qualifications to become solicitor advocates, who are eligible to plead even in the higher courts, and they make up the majority of the legal profession here. If you wanted to be a barrister you'd take the BPTC instead of the LPC. 

But in truth I think that while you would be able to study those courses no problem, getting a work visa would be nigh on impossible, especially as they got rid of the post study visa, as you wouldn't qualify under Tier 2. Your best option might be to get a position with a major U.S. firm that has a presence in London and hope for a transfer - there are plenty of Americans working in corporate law in the City at Jones Day, Meyer Brown, Hogan Lovells etc.

That's more like it. Roger Hunt scored 4 of his 31 league goals in Liverpool's 1963-64 title winning season. Hunt didn't even finish as top goal scorer in the league; in that year Jimmy Greaves scored 35.

In 1963-64 Roger Hunt and Ian St John scored 52 (!) league goals, Liverpool's highest ever partnership total in a title winning season.

I saw Hunt play once, what a player. He is third in Liverpool's *most goals in a year* table with 37 goals. 

I'll just get hold of that time machine and notify the transfer committee that he is available. Perhaps get Benzema as backup for Sturridge for good measure.

 [**Angry Dad**](https://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Angry%20Dad) (from Simpsons wikia): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;__Angry Dad__ is a fictional comic, 
turned internet series created by [Bart](https://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Bart_Simpson). It is just [Homer](https://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Homer_Simpson) when he does something stupid or when he is angry, or as Bart puts it, ""A little of my dad, [your](https://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Lisa_Simpson)  dad, bit of [Maggie](https://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Maggie_Simpson)'s dad."" Bart originally made Angry Dad to be a comic book, until a man from a fictional website offered to make it into an animated series. When Homer tried to give up rage, Bart devised a plan to get him mad. Unfortunately, the website that cast Angry Dad went broke, making the trap Bart set redundant. It is to be noted that the Angry Dad character seemed to have at least a bit more common sense than the man he originated from, Homer Simpson, as while angered at the headline of a newspaper (You Suck, Angry Dad), he accurately stated that that was an opinion and not news, something that Homer would not have deduced. Homer eventually allowed Bart to continue making episodes of it, although under the condition that it is semi-based on events in real life.

Kind of. The SNP were in the distant past a centrist party not too dissimilar from the LD's. The one thing that united the party was independence. In 1979 the first devolution referendum takes place and by some bullshit shenanigans by Labour it fails and the Labour government of the time puts devolution on the shelf.

The SNP, understandably rather pissed by all of this decided to get revenge on Labour by voting against Labour in a subsequent vote of no confidence which toppled Labour and brought Thatcher to power. 

The fallout resulted in the SNP getting absolutely destroyed at the next election and a rebuild in the 1980's where a more left-leaning faction in the party, led by Salmond took power.",null,0,null,1432804945,null,0,false,0,crnh23c,null,t3_37g53q,null,t1_crnh23c,null,t1_crmquql,null,null,null,1433311402,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

------  
  
There's a huge inequality there, where only men can be convicted of rape (as you legally need a penis).  
Semantically, rape had become synonymous with sexual assault and vice versa, yet the punishments haven't changed.  
  
A man can feel like he has (I suppose, metaphorically or spiritually) been 'raped', yet the attacker will only be charged with Sexual Assault (a lesser crime).  
  
I'm in no way wanting to detract from male on female rape victims. Rape is a horrifying, disgusting and deplorable act of the worst nature.  
In my views, all sexual assault should be should be treated under a blanket charge, with special higher charges raised if the victim suffered physical or mental harm. This is regardless of the sex of the victim or attacker.

If somebody has lived in a community for 20, 30, 40 years, there is a negative effect on social cohesion by kicking them out. You also increase ghettoisation as council houses become homes for *only* low-income people (reducing proximate economic opportunities). Large estates could become black holes for economic activity. Finally, you could potentially damage economic growth as residents intentionally sabotage their ability to maximise their economic potential so they can stay in their home.

But you don't reward those people who stayed even after they made it by selling them their house on the cheap. Plus for a party that worships private property, there is something incredibly pernicious about selling people it against the current owner's will. Eventually Labour or another party will realise there's a lot of votes to be won by extending right to buy to all private property and then we'll be living in very interesting times.

They are fattening the club up nicely and will try to turn a nice profit in the medium to long term, when they sell. They have gotten the football side of things massively wrong. The club lacks experience on the pitch and off it. Too many visionaries thinking they have the found the magic key to football success(as a recent article put it) while the club flounders from one mistake to the next.

People always compare FSG to H&amp;G but those were owners who nearly destroyed the club. Is that how we measure the successes of our club? Is the bar that low?

FSG have a chance this summer to rectify many issues in the club which need attention. The transfer policy isn't working. Whatever you think of the Sterling situation, and most of us are agreed on that, it is the loss of another of our best players. How can any project work when the best players leave every season? There is a lack of ambition that is seeping into the playing squad.

This is where FSG show their limitations where Liverpool is concerned. They have no attachment to Liverpool, beyond an investment on their portfolio. Hell, they have no knowledge or love for the game at all. 

This is why the constant comparisons with the Red Sox are pointless. John Henry has a deep emotional feeling for that club. He is often there, hands on, enthusiastic about the success of his baseball team. If people think Liverpool are equally important as the Red Sox to FSG then they are sadly mistaken.

The Liverpool project will lead us to be a top 7 team with occasional pushes for the top 4. To move beyond that I think we will need to move beyond FSG. I hope they get the stadium expanded, hold on for a year or two and sell us on. Good luck to them if they stabilised the club, maximise our revenue streams and leave us in good hands but I feel we won't have a chance of consistent success until we move away from FSG's model for running the football side of Liverpool.

null,false,haloraptor,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"That's reasonable. As someone who isn't Welsh or Scottish I honestly wouldn't expect you to understand - the current situation is just completely normal for you. Some of the problems are historical and some of them are current.

You'd know about historical population resettlements in Wales, things like the Welsh Not, the Tragedy of the Blue Books etc (those go a long way to explaining why the dissatisfaction came about in the first place). Other things include symbols of Britain being the same as symbols for England - bull dogs, to give a silly example.

Our national anthem is God Save the Queen, which is also... England's national anthem. For such a long time ""England"" was synonymous with the rest of the UK, even within the UK. It still is for many English people. EVEL, 'English votes for English laws', is a particularly dangerous proposal - on paper it's great, but what it actually does is lock Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish MPs from voting on proposed budget changes to their devolved administrations. Essentially our budgets are going to be set based wholly upon what English MPs want for England. I'm sure you can see why this is problematic, especially when Scotland turned back only 1 Conservative MP and Wales primary went Labour; our budgets are going to be set by English Conservative MPs, basically.

For a long time everyone you saw on TV was English. Not even from the north of England, just the south. Regional accents are something people joke about. I've been told, quite seriously, that a presentation I gave was 'too Welsh' that it 'distracted from the content'.

Historical wealth extraction. It might sound a bit like I'm harping on about old news here, but the mines closing and nothing being done to help out afterwards STILL has a major impact on Wales and the Welsh economy. We already have a £1.2bn shortfall in funding. The Conservatives are now planning to cut budgets even further and we don't have a voice to oppose it, not if EVEL gets through.

English people complain about 'English money' being sent to Wales. Okay. Fair enough. But the issue is that without that money we're going to continue getting poorer and poorer, but the debate doesn't really seem to address that ever. It's always ""we're all in this together, we need to make cuts"".

Debates are always focused on England and what England needs, and that's fine most of the time because most of the people live in England after all - but where's the voice for Wales? We have different, specific, needs. The Assembly addresses some of those and was a good move.

Blair's 'We're all middle class now' was just a completely laughable statement across much of Wales. Wales is one of the poorest places in the EU. I don't mean 'it's the poorest part of Britain so it's one of the poorest parts of the EU', I mean 'it is one of the absolute poorest parts of the EU, even in relation to Lithuania, Latvia, Croatia etc'.

We're different. The Welsh are different from the English. It isn't even about language really, although there is some of that. That's the thing about culture - sometimes you can't explain why, it's just something you feel. Although we share a lot of culture and history we're on completely different sides of it - when an English person thinks of Empire and the past, they think of British naval superiority, the rise of industrialism, the spread of English as a global language.

When a Welsh person thinks about history we remember forced resettlements overseas, forced settlement of English people in Welsh areas, the attempted eradication of Welsh language and culture, the dismantling of our legal system, that one time everyone in Wales was declared illiterate and innumerate, or when Thatcher closed the mines and literally destroyed many communities.

So - we have the same history, certainly. We just experienced and continue to experience different sides of it.

EDIT: I should add that it isn't completely black and white. I see myself as Welsh, but I also see myself as British. I have a difficult relationship with historical Britain for some of the reasons I outlined, but I also can't deny that I am absolutely a product of some of the good things about Britain as well as the bad. That's why I want to remain part of the UK. It's not because I want to continue receiving 'English money' (for the record, the idea is that wealth transfers would **stop** once they're no longer needed, but we need more money consistently in order to make that happen), it's because I feel like Wales is part of the UK. I want it to remain part of the UK. I just want a better constitutional set up that reflects and actually values the cultural diversity that has always been present here. Instead of botched attempts at cultural eradication and a rebranding of Englishness as Britishness.",null,0,null,1432806294,null,0,1432814684,0,crnhczd,null,t3_37hzi0,null,t1_crnhczd,null,t1_crngkie,null,null,null,1433311545,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

The Japanese PM simply requested the heads of major car makers reduce their US exports and they did.  No laws passed, no regulations, no threats.  Just a request from the PM and they put the national politics ahead of personal profit.

That's why private trains, nuclear power etc works in Japan:  everyone there is united in serving the people, the nation, society and behaving honourably etc.  They like profits, but it's a distance 5th place to the other items.

Do they?  Have their parliamentary candidates been preaching a war on the rich or somthing?  I don't know - I don't support Labour and it hasn't been well publicised if they have.  However, they do not have a reputation that I am aware of for being openly racist and homophobic.  Quite the opposite really - sort of ""nicely inclusive"" centralist socialist maybe?

Anyway - I googled [""labour party violent thugs""](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1CHWA_enGB625GB625&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=labour+party+violent+thugs) and it looks like most reports are about Labour councilors / candidates and supporters being attacked by UKIP and EDF type thugs.  Interesting though.

&gt;Have you also taken into consideration funding models?

No.  THB I hadn't.  I realise that Labour receives funds from some unions and the Torys receive funds from business and personal donations.  That however has nothing to do with perceived racist and homophobic tendency of an organisation has it?  I don't understand the relevancy of your question?  

However, it has got to be better than saying that the flooding in Somerset was divine retribution for allowing gay marriage or Ken Chapmans comment of “Islam is a cancer that needs eradicating. Multiculturism does not work in this country. Clear them all off to the desert with their camels, that’s their way of life.” or Joseph Quirk's comment of “Well, I reckon dogs are more intelligent, better company and certainly better behaved than most Muslims.”  

You make a moral choice when you side with these people.  In my opinion it is a poor and amoral one.

&gt;can you face up to the reality of what Labour is?

There seems to be a lot of rhetorical questions - which will pretty much stop an argument dead if someone's answer is 'yes', and then disingenuous examples.  The idea of a random bloke at a party going through your phone is firstly, a completely different scenario.  One's opinion of someone socially inept and morally ambiguous enough to steal and search a stranger's phone is likely to be drastically different to a government agency which has obtained a court-ordered warrant for a specific purpose.  If I was given a choice about which of those parties gets to look at my private information, there's a clear choice, and I think that undermines the point.

Furthermore, the ripostes put forward centre around issues like 'well why do you lock your phone' and 'why do you close the curtains when you get changed'.  The answer to which is in fact because I don't want people sending messages on my behalf and because of the social stigma if I didn't, respectively.  There are some people who *genuinely* feel they have nothing to hide, and rhetorical questions which seem based around assumptions of shared opinions aren't likely to convince anyone.


I'm not suggesting there isn't a point to be made here - I certainly understand people's concern.  It seems to be an underrated factor, however, that this isn't people consenting to an invasion of privacy because that's what they fancy doing today, but because they have legitimate, if exaggerated, concerns about their wellbeing and national security.  This entire debate is centred around a balancing act, and the assumption that people might support these measures because they're fine with it and not because they've traded it off as the lesser of two evils seems to undermine the arguments being made.

When we first arrived my friend (who isn't the brightest spark) tried to get a picture of Kasper but the knob left his flash on!

He did later pocket Wes' tie when he threw it to the floor to start play fighting. It is now hanging on my friends wall at home.

All anyone can do is see that you're running an encrypted stream. 

The only ways you can really monitor someone using a vpn is by either them having malware on their computer which send you details of what they're browsing, or by getting the logs of the VPN provider. So, if you want to maintain privacy you need to get a VPN provider that doesn't keep logs, of which there are hundreds.

In China they try to block VPN access by blocking VPN providers websites, however I can't imagine the UK would go that far, also it doesn't really work in the same way that blocking TPB doesn't work.

NB. you cannot maintain anonymity using a VPN, the VPN providers log will usually contain info like what amount of traffic you're using and when you're using it and what your billing details are, but you can have privacy.

I mean I only really use a VPN because its good when I'm travelling (I use [PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/)) as you can set your location to anywhere in the world, also I go to China sometimes and its more or less a necessity there. But also its super useful if I want to download a torrent or something, so I use it then too, you get a slight reduction in speed, but nothing major.

This is why the whole thing is so completely pointless, its so, so easy (and cheap) to get around this kind of thing. When I'm in China I set up my VPN to connect on startup on my laptop and phone and I can use the internet like I am at home, this is what every foreign person (and a lot of clever Chinese people) are doing, they can't ban VPNs outright because they have so many business uses.

You can also set up a VPN to work off your router, so you don't even need to bother about having it set up on your PC.",null,0,null,1432808313,null,0,1432809289,0,crnhtdx,null,t3_37i13i,null,t1_crnhtdx,null,t1_crnhksd,null,null,null,1433311760,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

&gt;#Aston Villa Review: Episode 121 - FA Cup Final preview interviews
With the FA Cup Final between Aston Villa and Arsenal just a couple of days away, we sent Steve on a mission: talk to a handful of diverse Villa supporters and ask them a bunch of questions about the big game. Being a diligent sort he did exactly that, and this bonus podcast is the result. It features interviews with Robert Lintott of 7500 To Holte, Carl Chinn, Jamie Cutteridge and journalist Sam Tighe.

&gt;Later today we'll be releasing our regular show which is, unsurprisingly, a full FA Cup Final preview.

&gt;&gt;The issue of people working on zero-hours contracts is a tricky one. The ONS has published figures suggesting that 2 per cent of people in employment are on a zero-hours contract – or about 622,000 people. But we don’t know whether that is more or less than in 2010.
Last year the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir Andrew Dilnot, gave Labour a slap on the wrist over a dodgy press release that claimed there had been a “huge increase” in zero hours contracts under David Cameron, when there was no evidence of a rise.

More current data:

I've also seen studies the ONS have done on zero hour contracted people and the majority are not looking for more hours and the overwhelming majority are not looking for another job.

&gt;The __Socialist Party__ is a [Trotskyist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism) political party in England and Wales which adopted its current name in 1997. It was formerly known as the [Militant tendency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militant_tendency) within the [Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK\)) in the latter half of the last century. It stands under the banner of the [Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Unionist_and_Socialist_Coalition) (TUSC) in elections.  The Socialist Party argues for a policy of trade union struggle against austerity, claiming members in executive positions in a number of militant trade unions   and gives prominent support to the work of [Youth Fight for Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Fight_for_Jobs).

I'm so overjoyed by this by... My happiness simply overpowers me. This is our first chance of something happening, a tiny ray of hope and then I see our alternative is the Jordanian prince... Then my thoughts turn to the fact this one question. 

Why didn't any of the EU police forces deal with this? One would have thought, hoped, hell I actually prayed for it. That the UK Police or the BKA or someone in a position of authority and power would have investigated FIFA. But no, it took the FBI to do it. I'm not trying to denigrate the FBI here, even if it may sound like it. I applaud their hard work and dedication in engaging in such a massive undertaking. But really, I ask again to myself and now to everyone here why didn't the police forces in the EU do this? Why wasn't the City of London police (supposedly experts in financial crimes and bribery and corruption investigations) involved the instant the first Times article about a corrupt Qatari bid? Hell there were even articles in the British press at the time when the British Sports Minister at the time said and I quote:

&gt; 'The sports minister when the English Football Association launched its unsuccessful £21m bid to host the 2018 tournament said: ""We bid on the basis of that assurance, only to find we didn't have a chance because the whole process was corrupt.""'

http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/02/russia-2018-world-cup-vote-rerun-qatar-gerry-sutcliffe

This isn't some kind of tabloid rag and this isn't some tiny fringe lunatic either. So while I'm ridiculously happy that the FBI has done something, I'm also tragically disappointed that it took the guts and the wherewithal of the US to do this and that it wasn't instead a European police agency leading the charge.

You are also missing some very pertinent issues, the DoJ investigation is primarily focused on CONCACAF and CONMEBOL and do not touch UEFA, CAF, OFC or AFC at all. While you could argue quite easily that CONMEBOL isn't within the USA's jurisdiction at all, a lot of the financial transactions were funnelled through accounts held/controlled within the USA and considering the RICO act this puts FIFA's bad actors well within the scope of the DoJ. I hope that helps with your question.

A Stocks &amp; Shares ISA sounds like a sensible idea, assuming you already have an ""emergency fund"" in your 123 account.

Yes you can transfer shares into a S&amp;S ISA but you need to do it through a process known as Bed and ISA: https://www.tddirectinvesting.co.uk/help/faqquestions/what-is-a-bed-and-isa-and-how-much-does-it-cost/

Strictly speaking no.  In general you can only put cash into a S&amp;S ISA - you must purchase the shares, funds, etc. inside the ISA via whatever method(s) your provider supports.

What you can do is sell your shares, put the cash into an ISA and re-buy them.  This will potentially cost you in dealing charges although many platforms will offer a ""Bed and ISA"" deal to do the sale and re-buy cheaply.  The profit from the sale would also be liable to Capital Gains Tax but that's only a concern if the proceeds (plus any other chargeable gains you make this tax year) will exceed your £11,100 CGT allowance.

There is one exception to the above which might be useful to you down the line.

Er, no actually. The underlying fundamentals of the business are going to dictate its value if and when it comes to sale time, not intangible assets like trophies.

Trophies may have an indirect impact on finances, but in themselves they're not that valuable.

Steadying the ship and investing in players with a strong resale value is a far sounder strategy from a business perspective than spending money in the hope that you'll win trophies.

Look at Arsenal; they've concentrated on stability in order to maintain the finances needed to pay off the Emirates, rather than spend in the hopes that the prestige of trophies will find them that cash.

If you want to donate money to any other political party you have to make an effort to do it.

Unite doesn't even make it as easy as a tick box on the application form, you have to request, fill out and return a different form once you're a member. What if you want the union to lobby politically on a non-partisan basis?

The idea of calling it a ""political fund"" is a tad misleading if it's really going to be used to prop up one party

Doesn't seem terribly fair - and it's not surprising that Labour List will moan about it because it could lead to a loss of revenue (from people who weren't aware / couldn't be bothered to opt out)

1. Diversify your investments by buying shares in a fund that invests in a wide range of companies, this will in theory average out any fluctuations seen by certain sectors.
2. Go for passive over actively managed funds. Active funds charge much larger fees which erode your investments and in the long run rarely give an advantage.

There are many tracker funds available there are ones that attempt to track the top 100 or 101-350 companies on the LSE (FTSE 100, FTSE 250 etc...) All are slightly different and each assign a different weighting to various types of companies (you should read up on smart beta if you havn't already). You can also buy funds that spread investments around the world or in specific countries if you would like to be exposed to a particular market.

One last thing I will mention is that tracker funds and ETF's (Exchange traded funds) are essentially the same thing (to my knowledge) but ETF's are as the name states, shares that are traded on the market so it is just like buying shares in a company. HSBC FTSE 250 (HMCX) is one example of this. 

It may be possible to transfer across from one broker to another or S&amp;S ISA but when I did it with mine there was a small fee associated (£12.50).

The authorities gave such exemplary workers the title of ""Stakhanovite"", and these Stakhanovites were given special privileges such as more generous rations. The movement was generally not favoured by the majority of the workers, since it was dividing them up into haves and have-nots, and those who pulled their weight and did not (in the eyes of the authorities).

You bought an 8 year old car. You didn't say how many miles it's done, but the average number of miles a car does is around 10,000 per year, and the average number of mile a clutch lasts is around 80,000.

The ""Which"" report which someone else has linked to says the car must:

&gt; be of satisfactory quality (taking into account its age and mileage)

Taking into account its age, and an assumed mileage of around 80,000, I'd say it's not unreasonable to expect a clutch to go at this point in its life.

Also, I'm no mechanic, but I believe that a dodgy clutch is something it's hard to hide, so it may be - assuming the problem wasn't there when you test-drove the car and collected it - that it genuinely has just gone.

Because this is in line with normal wear and tear, it's quite likely that it's not covered by a warranty, but you'd need to check the terms and conditions of your warranty for that.

Also, you don't say exactly what the relationship is between you, the garage and the warranty company, but if the garage have purchased a warranty from a third party, then there's a good argument to say that they've done their bit, and that your complaint now is with the warranty company, not the garage (unless you believe the car was faulty when it was sold to you and the garage knew about it).

&gt;

&gt;The __Nendrum Monastery mill__ was a [tide mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide_mill) on an island in [Strangford Lough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangford_Lough) in [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). It is the earliest excavated tide mill, dating from 787 AD. Its millstones are 830mm in diameter and the horizontal wheel is estimated to have developed 7/8HP at its peak. Remains of an earlier mill dated at 619 AD were also found.

Blair and Brown have led Labour for 15 out of the last 20 years and neither was the preferred choice of the unions. Burnham is the ""union choice"", but he's hardly bought and owned by them. 

The Blairites problem is that they are a minority of the Labour Party, trade unionists make up a bigger proportion of the party they do and many activists in the party who aren't TU members often lean towards their position rather than the Blairites.

Is booze allowed in The Arb? A crisp beer/wine in the sun might be nice, not that alcohol is mandatory.

For me it would have to be a fleeting visit due to the mutt. I could bring him to the park I guess, which would let me hang around for longer but I wouldn't want to impose His Hairiness on people with allergies/phobias.

Other possibles (assuming city centre is a requirement):

* Organ Grinder at Canning Circus, I *think* they have an outside area. Could be wrong. No food though.

* The Falcon, also at Canning Circus, they have an upstairs area you might be able to snaffle for nowt. Bar snacks only, cracking Scotch Eggs though.

* Newshouse down near Broadmarsh; people can learn how to play classic bar games and they also let you order in food. No outside area.

* Canalhouse/Fellows, Morton &amp; Clayton? Actually, there's a few places near the canal in that area.

Further possibilities (selfishness set to maximum):

* Victoria Inn, Star Inn, Crown Inn; all in Beeston. All have outside areas, serve good beer, first two do good grub as well whilst the Crown does bar snacks (pies etc).

* Hop Pole on Chilwell road is nice. Heck, throw a stone in Beeston and you'll hit at least two good pubs!

Mad idea:

* Have multiple locations.
 * Start at, say, the Arb/Lincolnshire @ 1200.
 * Walk to the Grinder/Falcon for 1600.
 * Bus it to The Star @2000.
 * Go home.
 * Or some other route/timings based on who says ""Aye"". Be a total pig to organise, but would mean that you capture folks geographically.

If they hadn't been put out, they could sit on the house until its value returned to 200k and then sell it and move on elsewhere without any shortfall that they need to make up.  The death threat, timed with a recession has forced them into selling and accepting the negative equity as a loss.


I've heard unfounded rumours of some policemen abusing the scheme but there is unfortunately a genuine need for such assistance(cos norn iron).  If you were in the private sector and received unavoidable death threats as a direct result of your job then there would probably be some duty of care owed by the company to look after you, maybe assistance with rehoming, using insurance to make up the negative equity.

null,false,hughk,eu,European Union/Yorks,null,"I'm sorry if you already know this but to quickly revise how typical message encryption works.

We normally split cryptosystems into symmetric systems and asymmetric systems. A symmetric system is where both sender and recipient share the same key. An asymmetric system is where there are two mathematically linked keys, one used for encrypting and the other used for decrypting. One key of the pair is published and is known as the public key, the other is kept private and is known only to its owner. The link between public and private keys must be very difficult to determine.

With an asymmetric system, we would normally both have each other's public keys. This can be done by prior knowledge, a trusted introducer or established via a prior exchange and checked using another channel (i.e., reading key finger prints to each other).

The Iron Age - 500 B.C - Gaelic and Celtic [I really don't like the term Celtic.

So for 7,500 years there was no Gaelic culture in Ireland. There was definitely religion, culture and tradition, but it wasn't Gaelic. 

There could have been human settlement on Ireland even prior to that - but there is no evidence of it because the entire surface of what is Ireland now was beat shitless by big ice cubes - this, not St Patrick is the reason we have no snakes. As the glaciers receded the water they left made a sea and this stopped a lot of migratory animals and plants heading our way.

null,false,PuddleOfCrud,null,null,null,"According to Uber they're not a taxi firm, they're a service that facilitates between drivers and passengers.  This is why black cabs and other cab firms are subject to regulations that Uber aren't which is why Uber can offer comparatively lower fares.

Uber's advertising is mostly word-of-mouth because when you're in the unique position to offer lower fares (because you're skirting regulations) you don't need much else since lower fares is all anyone cares about.

The lower fares wont last though; Uber have a provision called ""surge pricing"" which means the price of your fare can double or even triple during ""high usage"" hours.  More and more Uber drivers are cancelling trips until they can charge the ""surge"" fee meaning a lot of Uber journeys cost *more* than a black cab would have.  The drivers are pretty much forced to do this as Uber keeps taking a higher percentage of the fares.

Uber drivers are not subjected to proper regulations either which is why half of them have no idea where they're going and can't even effectively use Sat-Navs.

Uber are a god-awful company run by god-awful people (google ""Travis Kalanick controversy"") but they offer comparatively cheaper fares (for now) so everyone rants and raves about them.

If you're curious about just how shady Uber are go to their website and try to deactivate/delete your account - that's right, there's no option to do that.  What web company doesn't have that option in 2015?

Edinburgh is an all-year round destination, it's always a good time to visit. August is however the most expensive time. It's the peak period because of the Festival, where Edinburgh gets busy and rather expensive for a tourist. Other months are more economical, but you will miss out on the Festival. It really is down to what you're looking for in a trip.

Hope this helps.

Very few providers are interested in small pots (BestInvest, who also charge 0.3% PA, require a minimum of £10k also). Their admin burden doesn't particularly scale with funds under management, and such a small pot of money may well represent a loss.

0.45% PA is pretty low cost for an occupation pension, and will be the total cost including investments, where-as any of the D2C SIPP providers quoted costs exclude investments.

I know Hargreaves Lansdown would accept a £4k transfer; their limits are incredibly low. Their fee is 0.45% PA.

At the lowest end, you could probably arrange investments for &lt; 0.2% PA, meaning total costs with Cavendish/BestInvest (if they allowed a transfer) would be ~ 0.5%, HL would be ~ 0.65%.

Saving up an emergency fund is a good idea, but I'd do my best to build up a buffer of ~£500 if you can before going at your plan full pelt. I mean, you've got 6 months to save £2000 at £500/month. You'll manage to make the time-critical things (September overdraft + insurance) quite easily.

(Assuming a June start to the job)

|Month | what do |
|--------|------------|
|June| £500 to overdraft (now at -£1500)|
|July| £500 to overdraft (now at -£1000)|
|August| £500 to overdraft (now at -£500)|
|September| £500 to insurance (now at £500)|
|October| £500 to insurance (now at £1000)|
|November| £250 to parents, £250 to overdraft (-£2250, -£250)|
|December| £250 to parents, £250 to overdraft (-£2000, £0)|
|Jan| £250 to parents, £250 to overdraft (-£1750, £500)|
|Feb| £500 to parents (-£1250)|
|March| £500 to parents (-£750)|
|April| £500 to parents (-£250)|
|May| £250-£500 to parents, depending on agreement with them (are you offering/being asked to pay interest) (£0)|

This leaves you with a £500 starting value to an emergency fund/rainy day fund. I'd give yourself this buffer, because without it, you're banking entirely on your car not blowing up between now and November, because if it does, you're back in that overdraft and paying interest. AND trying to pay back your parents.

Taking the company match is a good idea, because it gets you started on the footing of having a little less in your paycheck, which gives you no opportunity to miss the ~£50, and even if it means a couple fewer nights out, you'll thank yourself later.",null,0,null,1432817798,null,0,false,0,crnksgg,null,t3_37l3bh,null,t1_crnksgg,null,t3_37l3bh,null,null,null,1433313230,null,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2,null

And the same applied to Labour in the 1980's - the SDP lot were content with the status quo (Thatcher) which is why they felt comfortable pursuing their own thing, it was win-win for them.

It's also interesting to look at the Conservatives because what happened to them is a mirror to what is happening in Labour.

When Blair was in power, they were comfortable - nothing bad was happening to the centre-right. So they felt they could pursue ""pure"" un-electable right wing politics (Hague, IDS) and there was no downside, because if they didn't win, and they were never going to with those policies, comfortable old Blair was in power and life was not so bad.

Then Gordon Brown comes to power, and they *hate* him. They are acutely *uncomfortable* with him being in power, and they suddenly got interested in having a moderate front man (Cameron) in order to get back into power - they even made compromises and went into coalition with the LibDems who were restraining them on all sorts of areas (Human Rights Act, spying on citizens etc). Being uncomfortable was what made them take getting into power seriously.

At the moment, the left is comfortable with Cameron, so they feel able to pursue their own ""pure"" policies whether Green or SNP, and if they don't win, no matter, comfortable lazy old Cameron is in power.

It will only be when Cameron leaves and the Conservatives elect someone *uncomfortable* as leader, that the left will wake up and make a real push for power (which always involves compromises).

However, I bet if you told purists who vote for Greens, SNP etc that the real reason they're doing it and refusing to compromise is because they're comfortable with Cameron, they'd protest loudly.

They will be with the Tories changes as well, but the Tories want to base constituency size on the number of registered voters rather than the actual population. This subtle change will benefit the Tories, as Labour voting areas tend to be more deprived areas were fewer people bother to vote or register to vote. Whether you call this gerrymandering or not, it will undoubtedly favour the Tories.

As for making union members have to opt in to make a donation to the Labour party rather than opt out, studies have shown that if you force people to make an active choice to do something rather than make it the default it massively changes people's behaviour. They can already opt-out if they don't want to support the Labour party, so this change doesn't give them any more choice, it just biases the choice away from supporting the Labour party.

Look to America though for the reality, where the federal government used to be weak and left everything to the states, however, slowly the federal government accrued more and more power at the cost of the individual states.  That will happen to us.  The (largely) sovereign states of today will eventually be utterly powerless in the face of federal power in Brussels.

Right at the end you mention letters (I don't know how to do the blue quote thing sorry!): ""In the end, I need help in finding out these answers and/or writing up letters to the owners/future owners in an attempt to get clear answers."" 

Which was the main bit I was confused about- what you're actually wanting to do! I understand the whole finding out what the businesses are and their ethics and am fully behind it!

Moreno got a decent run and Lovren did too, albeit out of necessity when Sakho got injured. But neither player did very well. Moreno doesn't seem to know how to defend and Lovren just seemed completely overwhelmed.

Markovic was never played in the correct position, being force to play wing-back when we played 3 at the back. He looked ok in spells played but Rodgers didn't go out of his way to accommodate him and he failed to make the bench towards the end of the season.

Yes. They absolutely are.

However, these trips are basically vacations. They will have a few light, brief practices, followed a few games where they aren't expected to put out a lot of energy. They will be staying in the nicest hotels, and many of them have family coming along for the trip. 

Remember, these guys are professional athletes. They are used to spending 6 or more hours training and working on their game nearly every day. For this trip to Thailand, I can't imagine that they will spend more than 90 minutes each day focused on football.

the focus, first and foremost, needs to be on attracting a striker who we think can score lots of goals for us. simultaneously, we'd be well to nail down ings and milner on frees. my next priority would be to sign a rb, janmaat being my personal preferance if he's available...after that, a marquee CM signing would be very welcome, but i would be happy enough with that window and continuing to develop players like jordan williams, jordon ibe, sinclair and teixiera next season...

now with all of that said, let me loop back around...sturridge is never a guarantee to stay healthy for more than 15-20 matches per season, really hes not. i can't trust that, which is why we need another striker who can score goals. if sterling does in fact leave, i actually see origi and markovich being the guys to get a chance to take up his helm. if that is not the plan, i wouldn't mind seeing us utilize milner in that role regularly and let marko, ibe and origi develop underneath him/alongside him. as for the CM, if lucas does in fact leave, that player needs to be a deep lying cm who is adept at breaking up play and turning that into momentum in attack. don't know who's realistic, but i am a big fan of kondogbia, gonalons, xhaka and think players like that would be the right fit...and hell, who knows, maybe tiago ilori could actually slot in there with his pace, defensive prowess and comfort on the ball. finally, the signing of ings is fascinating to me. it is an absolute no brainer to sign him. he is almost an english international, 22 years old, scored 10 goals last year in a struggling burnley side. his upside is immense for us, and if he never earns a spot, his profitiability is guaranteed to be over 100%. If he doesn't work out, we could sell him anywhere between 10-20m...if shane long at 27/28 can get moved on after scoring 24 premier league goals in 3 years with west brom/hull for 12m, ings is certainly worth at least 15 in the current transfer climate because he scored 10 for a team that got relegated and is only 22. anyone who thinks that's a bad signing is delusional, it is literally the steal of the transfer window from the EPL.

I don't think it's ever a reasonable expectation for people other than the manager to dictate who should play. 

The fundamental problem right now is there's no hierarchy with the committee and the manager - do they exist to find solutions to his squad needs, or does he exist to play the players they identify? If what Evans is saying is true, then FSG want it to be the latter - a very baseball-esque model that quite frankly won't work in football. It really must be the other way round - have the committee, because they are better at identifying talents than Rodgers, but make it clear that if a player is signed and then not played, then that means they've not chosen the right player for the manager's requirements.

Once you no longer require wealth transfers you become a net contributor. Or, well, that's the idea.

We're a net contributor because, in the main, we can afford to be. But we also benefit from other EU things not just financially but socially, in scientific partnerships and exchanges... top scientists from all over the EU usually choose to bring lots of funding with them to UK universities because we're pretty damned good at science. 

Certain regions also benefit from EU policies and programmes designed to help the poorest parts of the EU - such as Wales and Cornwall. 

I like the EU project. I like that we're standardising all sorts of things across the EU. I like the element of wealth transfers. I like the EU's commitments to science, and to climate change research, and other things. I think there are problems with the EU but you can't reform something from outside of the thing.

For the NHS - I actually worked for them in IT for a time. I found a lot of the practices wasteful and outrageous compared to my private sector jobs. So it is important to point out the NHS budget is not being reduced at all, but they are trimming the fat from some areas to push it towards frontline care. Frankly, having experienced the waste - I could see a lot of areas where that applies. So my opinion on the NHS is clouded by that experience.

Few years ago left for Japan and lived there for over 3 years, which was awesome (and seeing the word 'xenophobic' bandied about by someone else downthread is just... well wrong basically, and actually they're also not indifferent, they're very curious and eager, for the most part (which is legalise for saying I too can't say that to every last person they're *not* xenophobic but in the circles I was lucky enough to be in.. no.. no they weren't). 


Leaving was a Bride From Kill Bill level of grim determination and intent.  So glad I did.  But as others are saying it was a double edged sword (pun?  pun!), in a way because of the personal growth and sheer fun on one hand, and a regret I couldn't have discovered that at home. 


Nonetheless the thought of coming back was daunting.  Then Boom, got back, and having also seen fair share of America (lots of US friends made in Japan and travelled to stay with them in their home towns many many times) I was ready to be mildly disappointed... 
 

But it was wonderful to see things like the (slightly hipster-ish? :P) craft beer trend coming over.  There was even some karaoke booths for a while on Lisburn Road at Zen Two.  The new bars, the activities that await people who want more than just a visit to Winemark and watching Saturday night TV or Youtube vids with friends at home is really nice (there's an 'escape room' activity which is hopefully is as fun as the ones in America).


And whether it's a rainy Cathedral Quarter in Belfast or a neon sanchome in Japan it very much depends on the social support net of friends you have around you.  Cos that's one thing you learn too going away, (And in the case of Japan REALLY away and in a very different culture).  The community and friends you make vastly affect where you live.  It can make or break it.  At the moment, here?  It's kinda breaking it.. but then I realise that's my fault to a very large extent.  Basically gather together the right group of friends who want nothing more than to enjoy whatever it is that gets the oxytocin flowing and ( barring obvious small-print asterisks) anywhere, certainly Belfast, can be quite fulfilling.  


(the one thing I find sucks the air out of any eager attempts to explore/try new places/eateries/activites/whatever is an overly critical/cynical naysayer, which is a rich vein running through manys a person here, that's the only broadsweeping 'hmm, yeah, less of this please' that I'd hazard to say about here. It's kinda off putting, to myself as well as foreigners (trust me many get our irony and sarcasm, its just less fun when it comes from a very cynical or judgemental heart...).  Again though, many really 'genki' people here, just need to befriend them more and keep on exploring)

And lest my rambling have made you forget, I'm honestly feeling a bit meh at the moment, and though that's due to more personal things I can sympathise readily with people finding it a less than fulfilling proposition and wanting out.

null,false,MaisondeMoggy,null,null,null,"The main reason we have for not using cats from shelters is that it is just impossible for us to accurately know their backgrounds. We feel that putting a group of rescue cats together in our cafe would have been unfair on them. You will commonly see on descriptions of shelter cats that they are best suited to a home with no other cats.

If we were to take cats in from shelters and encourage their adoption we would feel that level of unrest and moving around for the cats would be unnecessarily stressful. The cat being moved would likely be anxious, but not only that, it would mean bringing new cats into the cafe environment with every adoption causing serious unrest each time.

We would only ever bring very young cats into the cafe environment. Our cats have been together since they were kittens in order to be socialised with one another and also with people. While in future a rescue kitten will be a lovely addition to our family to begin with we needed the predictability of the litters our beautful cats were born into. I'm sure you'll agree that using rescue kittens would not have given us this chance.

Yes, in the early days of setting up the cafe the owner did meet with some shelters to discuss the matter. When setting up a new business it is always a good idea to examine all your options before moving forward with a decision.

Our cats are all pet cats belonging to the owner. If for some reason we were to close they would continue to be her pets at home. The same goes for if any were to need to leave Maison de Moggy.

Afraid I can't help you with information about Cattitude - you'll need to contact them directly.

You can complain - you have a right to think that marriage should be opened up to the gay community - that is however an aspiration. 

The right of gay people to marry is not a human right - not is this legislature - and as of the time of writing that is still compliant with the Code of Human Rights. 

You may say NI is embarrassing itself. The RoI is the first country in the world to do what it did. Everyone ought look backward by comparison. 

Germany, Italy, Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Gibraltar, Jersey, Isle of Man,  Denmark, Switzerland, and many other states do not recognise gay marriage as a human right - including the USA, Japan and Australia. 

You called someone stupid for being factually correct. Gay marriage is not a human right - not in Northern Ireland and our legislature is not breaking any Human Rights by legislating the way it is.  You're projecting your agenda as if it is a fact - it is not - but by all means campaign for equality.

EDIT: I still maintain you are being stupid by calling someone else stupid for being factually correct. 

EDIT 2: I fucking hate arguing with people who obviously want special privileges [marriage - don't take me wrong on this - I think both the idea of same sex marriage and heterosexual marriage gives undue privileges to people simply for taking an oath they can legally break at any time. Why should the children of married couples be better off than those of single parents, why should married couples have more benefits than a single person?] for their own, who then turn round and say the legitimate appeal of a party through the judicial system is a ""joke"".

They arbitrarily decided that the banks needed to lend more money to people seeking to buy homes.  That included people who would otherwise never be eligible to be able to take out a mortgage.  

This artificial expansion of credit led to the bubble which led to the crash.  It was the US federal government forcing dodgy loans into the financial system  ultimately caused the crash.  We got hurt because these mortgages ultimately ended up getting caught up in our own finance industry. 

The fact is that it was an American problem.  We got hurt not because of a lack of regulation because when America goes down so does the entire world (and of course, we have a large financial sector, so we were particularly badly hit).

* There's barely any pace or creativity in that team when you remember that this is a game we have to win, not draw.

* Rodgers had played Lambert for 6 or 7 90minute games in the 2-3 weeks before this game, Lambert had looked absolutely knackered in the last games and understandably so, still Rodgers started him again with neither Balotelli or Borini on the bench.

You just accused FSG of only being about the money, yet you are looking to attract new owners with the prospect of making money instead of having love of the game.  Most of the owners who care about football or a certain team don't have billions of pounds to spend and those that do rarely do so.  Look at QPR and Newcastle who have 2 of the richest owners in the PL.

Everyone is acting like Liverpool has all of a sudden become a selling club.  When was the last time Liverpool was an actual buying club, as in a final destination for talented players?  Even Gerrard considered leaving Liverpool to join a ""bigger"" club during his career.

I am not saying everything FSG does is perfect, they definitely need to sort out their transfer committee and probably get a better wage structure(which is a very good one for an ideal world, but unfortunately the current state of football isn't working in an ideal world).  The main point is everyone always thinks the grass is greener some where else, FSG hasn't taken any money out of the club or used the club as a personal checkbook like countless other owners have.  It has been pointed out by lots of people yet everyone tends to ignore the fact that Liverpool has squandered their opportunity to grow their global brand since the induction of the PL and now are trying to catch up to the teams that have done it properly.

null,false,Irmuhlay,,Sixth Form,null,"Nope, not at all! I'm in Year 13 and I do Maths and Further Maths (plus Physics and Computing... so, four calculator-y subjects). Of the ~150 people who do Maths at my sixth form, I can only think of three who have graphical calculators.

My weapon of choice is the [Casio fx-991ES PLUS](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0034BAQS8/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=569136327&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B0009FHRPW&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_r=1CBZ2CV8M8DX31H23T41), which sells for about £15. It's not graphical, but it has some other advantages compared to the 85/83 GT calculators which you may have already used at GCSE.

I didn't buy my calculator until after Christmas in Year 12 - before that, I was using an fx-85 GT PLUS. It had everything you need for the A-level course, but I upgraded to the fx-991ES PLUS for the added convenience of using the extra functions (numerical calculus, equation solving, vectors, etc) to check answers. 

A graphic calculator usually has the same functions as the fx-991ES PLUS, as well as graphing. This adds a bit of convenience for graph sketching questions, but I don't think I've ever seen a graph-sketching question that's worth more than about 4 marks on a 75 mark paper. They're all fairly straightforward without a graphic calculator, as long as you're solid on the maths. Also, if you're wanting to do maths at uni, graph sketching without a calculator is a good skill to develop.

That being said, some teachers focus more on calculator skills to pass the exam, so having a different calculator to your peers might make some parts of the lessons irrelevant to you. If you know anyone who already goes to the college, ask them about how much emphasis is put on the calculator by the teachers.",null,0,null,1432824206,null,0,false,0,crno5q4,null,t3_37kx62,null,t1_crno5q4,null,t3_37kx62,null,null,null,1433314817,null,3,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,3,null

In short, the only time that you could argue that 'everything was left to the states' was in the colonial era and in the early 1800s. States did have more power, but it was because there was a massive amount of land and a lack of technology and infrastructure that would have been necessary to administer such a place. The federal government was weak because it had to be. In the 1700s and early 1800s it was hugely difficult for a new country to have an effective federal government that could govern in places as disparate as Georgia in the far south and Maine in the far north near Canada. 

The Civil War, the bloodiest conflict in US history, happened when Southern states took their 'rights' to extremes, keeping their agricultural economy afloat by the brutal treatment of slaves. As technology and infrastructure developed the US expanded to the West Coast and the federal government became more powerful, but the states still had a lot of power to govern themselves.

Flash forward to today, where are you getting the idea that states in the US are 'utterly powerless'? The US states have a tremendous amount of power to dictate their own laws and budgets. I can't think of anything comparable in Europe, the amount of power the states have to dictate their own affairs makes even the most devo-maxed Scotland look paltry in comparison. Have you ever lived in the US or even spent any time there? The states vary hugely because the states have a hell of a lot of power.

I don't know how you could compare any of it to EU integration, which is 100% different on every level. I mean it's not even close, and your idea of some kind of future 'EU superstate' isn't backed up by facts either. If you're going to bring the US into it then at least study some US history before you spread this kind of misinformation.",null,0,null,1432824335,null,0,1432831022,0,crno8ia,null,t3_37kzfx,null,t1_crno8ia,null,t1_crnl6n6,null,null,null,1433314854,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

In England and Wales, over English was the main language for over 92% of the population, with Polish at 1%.

* Once those powers are transferred, there's no getting them back, you cannot vote for any party in the UK to undo something in a treaty.

* So the most important point is NOT what the EU deal is today because when people got to vote in 75 it was on an EU which was wildly different to what it is today. The question you have to ask is not what it is now but what it will be in 10 or 20 or even 30 years time, because *this* referendum will likely be your only direct chance to have say on the issue.

I do get your point about comparing the shows but I have only watched a few episodes of each (apart from Getting On where Capaldi wasn't a major character) and in each show I only saw a short acting part by Capaldi and I think he gave brilliant performance.

These moments are few and far between in Doctor Who so I honestly think it is the writers' styles in Doctor Who not matching up with in tone of other episodes as well as the range to which Capaldi is allowed to, not really improvise as such, but have more freedom as an actor in a scene.

It's here! It's here! The FA Cup Final is here and Aston Villa are bloody in it! Chris and Steve are very, very excited about Villa's Wembley meeting with Arsenal on Saturday and who could blame us? In this week's Aston Villa Review proper we dedicate the full show - obviously - to a preview of the match as the end of the 2014/15 season draws near.

&gt;We discuss Villa's approach and previous games against the Gunners, look at the available personnel options and talk about what the FA Cup Final actually means for a club like ours. A mediocre Villa side and a rookie manager stand on the edge of history and we'll be right there with them this weekend. Come on you Lions!

let me put something in context for you, dortmund have a 81,000 seat stadium so stadium revenue is flowing for them, in 04-05 and 05-06 they were 7th and dropped because of bad management and bad season but have historically been one of germany's most successful clubs..the 90s were ""their golden era"" 

now as you already know, the jump from 13th to 7th is not as difficult a gap to bridge as 6th to 4th, 3rd, 2nd or the title would be. he almost certainly would not win a title in his first 3 years. i can almost categorically (lol BR) deny that claim. while i do think he has a capacity to achieve 4th in his first season, that sentiment is equally shared by me for BR...i know br could achieve 4th next year. while i boo hoo jerk it about the transgressions of last season, i do get this ""fuck rodgers, he sucks"" mentality...but in reality, taking emotion from the last month out of this, rodgers showed a lot of resolve and ingenuity to get us back ""on track"" to be fair, up until chelsea, we were technically still in that race. had we beaten hull, cp, and stoke, had results for man u held, we would be 4th. the last month was the big fuck up. i can't fathom how the team imploded...which i believe is on BR. but we were in that thing, and we are firmly in a good position to challenge again next year if we hold strong and don't cave for raheem (but if someone wants to bid 50-60m, he's gone...bye byeeeee) and add players. 

anyways, im just saying im not sure klopp is the undoubted step up that people keep hailing him as. let me caveat this by saying, even though im a huge supporter of rodgers and think he could get a job done and win silverware with us, i wouldn't be unhappy if we started a new project with klopp (in fact i would feel good, b/c he has german connects which would be huge)...anyways, looking forward to your feedback...thanks for the discussion mate

Three days - for £50 a day. Actually £50 a day no matter what. Working shit tonnes of overtime for no extra cash and having to work over xmas no matter what.

Sanchez is more of a striker/winger. He's the target man and the one who is receiving from the midfield. He's a great player at what he's doing but I'm quite sure he couldn't take on hazards role at Chelsea. Comparing Sanchez to Neymar is much better than comparing him to Hazard.

He's shown a willingness to play youth, and understands the importance of it (even if Dortmund's academy isn't great).

He's a fantastic personality who the majority of players would love to play under.

What they are fighting for isn't any right of theirs, they have to make a cake not suck a cock. A win for them and the support of what you call their ""right"" is a win to allow open discrimination in this country, therefore if that was passed then I to could also open a business and refuse catholics if I want or Protestants hell I could even refuse people of a different race. 

See man your talking such bureaucratic bullshit yur just someone who thinks because something is written in law that it is infallible. That is just stupid, are you saying then that Gays have no right to get married? In the USA slavery was grand for the most part was it? Until they made it illegal yeah? 

My ""agenda"" is caleld common fucking sense, I am not looking special privleges, is it a specal privelee that we should live in a world where the government choose who does and who doesn't get discriminated against? I've lost you one the rights of single parents and married couples, what the fuck are you talking about? There is no rights, you are showing how obviously marriage doesn't matter to you as an institution then why the fuck do you care who gets married?

Human are allowed to marry yeah? Gay people are humans yeah? So they should have human rights....it is as simple as that. 

Yes those other nations are fucking stupid as well, and states within the US do allow it, it just isn't on a federal level yet. In two years all these nations will come by my way of thinking. 

I'm not even gay, I just believe that human rights should not be voted in and out of existence, I do not think the introduction of a law should eliminate a human right, and most certainly don't think a human right should be based on sexuality. 

So calm your tits. I will always fall on the side of fairness and equality. Live in the past if you want, just fucking realise that because something is law makes it right.

They have a regular monthly series that bounces around from Doctor to Doctor and then they have special series on the side. For instance, the 8th Doctor had a whole lot of stories in the main monthly range before getting his own series called the 8th Doctor Adventures dedicated just to him.

I'm particularly a fan of the 8th Doctor's run, especially his time with companion Lucie in the Eighth Doctor Adventures series. If you watched the 50th anniversary short prequel ""Night of the Doctor"", she was one of the companions mentioned. I actually listed to this series first before going backward and seeking out all the stories he had already done for the main range.

Ok first off you're missing some key points here. No-one in the UK has ever been indigenous, this is an island that has supported mass immigration for centuries.

Secondly the role of a capital city is to provide the means for Internatioanl Trade to take place. This usually means that people from all over the world inhabit them and broker connections with their host countries to enable trading of goods. Success in this means that more people come to stay; often they marry, locals or otherwise, have kids and on we go. Fifth and sixth generation Jews are now commonplace since the mass immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The reason that East Anglia and London are like different countries is, well, because they are. Multinational metropolitan cities are the future. Pick any capital city and you'll see the same trend. New York, Berlin, Paris, Vienna. The greater number of non-indigenous people you find in your capital the more successful you are clearly being in your role as international trade broker.

Being someone from this type of background, when I hear complaints about how foreign this City is I am only able to draw one conclusion about the person making the observation.

Zero-hours contracts do not seem to me to offer flexibility for workers. In fact, the opposite is true among the zero-hour employees I know. They are constantly ""on-call"" and don't have any advance knowledge of when they'll be asked to work.

Another major downside is variable earnings month to month, which can lead to difficulties keeping up with rent or mortgage payments. That's not flexibility, it's a lack of income security.

Genuine flexibility would have the business shoulder some of the burden caused by infrequent or variable working hours. Zero-hour contracts push all of the obligation onto the employee, so that the business doesn't ever have to risk paying someone when there isn't enough work.

I remember reading back around January I think it was where ""the owners"" (which I think translates to Gordon) had expressed concern to Rodgers that we were spending a lot of money on players, but those players weren't playing, and that it was expected for the Academy players to be used more than they have been.  The result of this (supposedly) was we acquired no one in January and recalled Ibe.

Frankly I can't blame the owners (if the supposition above is true) for being a bit unhappy.  Rodgers/the committee/whoever you want to apportion blame to has bought an awful lot of players over the past 3 years and hardly any of them have had a proper go of it.  Ilori has never played, Yesil got 2 cup games, Aspas, Alberto were marginalized, Balotelli dropped, Sakho dropped, Lovren dropped, Borini banished, etc.  It also makes little sense to me why we haven't seen more of our own youth being played, although I am happy to see Ibe getting a bit of a run even if turns out it was forced on Rodgers as I think our U-21s have been massively underutilized by BR.

Now if the players are being bought against BR's wishes and he doesn't rate them- I don't honestly care.  He needs to figure out how to use them anyway or at least give them a shot, that's the way this works.  There are very few managerial positions where the manager has 100% control over all transfers with the only one I can think of being Wegner.  Pellegrini has to deal with Txiki, Mourinho has Emenalo, Klopp has Zorc, etc.  Quit whining about it and figure it out- if the acquired players not of his choice turn out to be awful after being given a chance, then fair enough and at the point the manager has every right to take the issue to the owners.",null,0,null,1432828262,null,0,false,0,crnqplq,null,t3_37l3n3,null,t1_crnqplq,null,t1_crnplzm,null,null,null,1433316020,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

From my perspective the only difference is in one case we see them as a victim of grooming by a sick pervert rather than as active participants with free choice, but in the ISIS case we see them as active participants with a free choice rather than victims of grooming by sick murderers.

I don't want to waste your time by launching into a huge defence of privacy off the bat, but, if you're willing, it'd be great to hear a little more on your particular opinion as it's by no means uncommon. It may inform a post on www.reinst8.org to address the kinds of oppositional claims which are most commonly levied at digital rights campaigns (such as the one linked to in the OP re: 'nothing to hide, nothing to fear')!

Two points then:

1. I don't think that precedent is a good argument for 'value', 'correct-ness', etc.—I assume that no communications I send/receive are private, but that doesn't make it a good thing that they are not.

2. This is essentially the 'nothing to hide' argument which we attempted to address in [this article on our website](www.reinst8.org/opinion/nothing-to-hide-everything-to-fear). It's a little ponderous a point, but my own feeling is that we have to move away from the teleological consequences of privacy invasion ('you caught one terrorist by spying on every one, well done', or 'you missed ten terrorists by not spying enough, you idiot') to the *act* itself of violating privacy. The mantra I return to here is that **privacy is not an admission of guilt**. This is to say that it privacy violation isn't bad for us *if and only if* something which we would rather keep hidden is uncovered; it's bad *per se*.

Let me know what you think about the article (which goes into more depth and is probable more readable than me rambling at you), and we'll continue from there, if you're interested in further discussion!

Because you've accused me of ""talking such bureaucratic bullshit yur just someone who thinks because something is written in law that it is infallible. That is just stupid, are you saying then that Gays have no right to get married? In the USA slavery was grand for the most part was it? Until they made it illegal yeah?""

Yet if you actually read what I wrote - or even took the time to realise I wasn't the person you were originally arguing with you would see I clearly stated: ""The national law in NI is that men and men, women and women do not have that right - ergo it is not a human right - not yet anyway. That may change - as all laws a mutable.""

I've told you I understand that all laws are mutable, I'm not a fucking idiot - and you're bringing up slavery? Bah. 

If you're siding for fairness and equality surely you understand it is fair and equal for the bakery to have the right to appeal, no?

You haven't understood anything I've written so I wouldn't expect you to understand that democracy is meant to be an inconvenience. 

I'll put it in laymans terms - There is a Code of what is and what is not a human right. Article 12 states that depending on the national laws of a place - men and women can marry - even gay men and women. So in some places Gay marriage is a human right and in others it is not [above I've pointed a few out]. I've also pointed out that laws are mutable and marriage laws in NI may change. 

Here's the inconvenient bit - for what you say IS a human right to BECOME a human right you have to CAMPAIGN for it. Which is your democratic right. And the Bakers have a democratic right to try to have a decision made by a judge overturned in a higher court. But to simply say it is a human right before it becoming one it a tautological argument. Its just self serving. 

Hypothetically - say the bakery do get the decision overturned. Will it be a ""joke"" for that decision to be appealed by Gareth Lee and taken to the ECHR? I'm sure there's a court in between but I'm a bit hazy.

Please stop being stupid and just read what people write. 

You called someone else, and me stupid, I called you stupid, you had a wee fit and didn't really read what I wrote. Stoopid.

Going to repeat some of the things others have said, particularly the ones that come to mind when I reminisce about come back.


Firstly I know weather is a very British thing to moan about but over the past few years it's been actually quite good with lots of heatwaves (small print asterisk about heatwaves not *technically* being a 'good' thing aside!) so all being well there should be plenty of chance to enjoy the many new beer gardens that have sprung up.  


Happily enough there's a local brewery called Hilden which has a festival around then, and their drinks are rather nice.  Take the train to it for an afternoon of frivolity (the local trains also are ridiculously nice and even give Japan ones a run for their money... timetable wise though... maybe not so much :P)


Spekaing of travel, the distances involved getting to the beach whenever there is very nice weather is trivial when considering the distances involved living in Japan / America which means just about anything that strikes your fancy is an impulse drive away.  Dublin is about 2 hours away, which raises the (expensive) possibility of a day trip driving even!  Gosh knows we did the same going to Sendai for the day and loved it.  


And if Uber sets up shop here it'll hopefully be even cheaper/easier to get around while slightly drunk to all these different places.  


Nowadays there are lots of food festivals and beer festivals which remind me of America in very good ways.  And there may be naysayers about the usual tourist attractions like the Titanic but the workmanship and skill we (once) had is something that the Titanic exhibits touch upon nicely and ultimately is what we should be proud of.  


And lastly, you may be lucky enough to spot some film stars milling about!  I saw Little Finger, and was suitably terrified and amazed.

The failures of the Russian revolution and the rise of stalinism is still widely debated in historiography. One plausible reason from the some marxist camps is that the Bolsheviks forced State Communism (an oxymoron) upon Russia and the successor USSR, BEFORE either had properly modernised. Surely if you know your Marx you would know a classless, moneyless, stateless society cannot arise from a not-yet modernised, heavily agrarian State. Surely if you knew your history you would know of the mensheviks and other non-bolsheviks who argued against imposing a regime upon Russia and wanted gradual reform, liberals and socialists alike! Why? Because the social antagonisms necessary for communism cannot/do not exist in a pre-modern State.

Have you ever actually been on zero hours?

As someone who has been on zero hours for almost quarter of a century...

&gt; Zero-hours contracts do not seem to me to offer flexibility for workers. 

I get asked every week when I'm available and I'll give them a list of days. Every day I'll get a text saying what I'm doing the following day. Sometimes something comes up and I need additional time off so I'll tell them I'm not available for the following day and take it off. Wife is going away this weekend. She decided that she had a lot of stuff she needed to get done before she went so announced to her boss that she wasn't going to work tomorrow. Going back to working nights I missed going to a club I've been a member of for 5 years so I just told them I wasn't working Wednesdays any more and now I don't unless I choose to. In fact its got to the point where they just take it for granted I'm not available on a Wednesday now.

&gt; They are constantly ""on-call"" and don't have any advance knowledge of when they'll be asked to work.

Its pretty much going to be Mon-Fri so you don't plan anything for those days and as I said, if you definitely want a day off for something you just tell them you're not available that day and they don't ask.

&gt; Another major downside is variable earnings month to month, which can lead to difficulties keeping up with rent or mortgage payments. That's not flexibility, it's a lack of income security.

Yet as a truck driver I own two houses so it can't be that bad. Yes earnings are variable but when you've been doing it long enough you know when the busy and quiet periods are and you build up a buffer. For me it usually drops off in September and February. In October it goes absolutely mental so I work all the hours there are in October and the first week in November and use that money to help get through February. If anything it is a good thing because you learn to live within your means and not spend everything in the bank just because its there.

That's a nice thought and everything, but it would *never happen in a million years* and is such an impossibility that I doubt FSG have even considered it.

I think that the key problem we face in getting people to care about the issue is the asymmetrical trust relationship between the electorate and the elected officials: we seem to value trusting the government, but the government has no trust in us.

One of the most common arguments for this kind of untargeted, warrantless spying/data retention is 'well, it could be bad if *X* were doing it, but it's *the government*'. This kind of 'what could possibly go wrong' is a total failure of imagination. All sorts could go wrong, and indeed lots already has. The truth is *we just can't know the extent* because we, as a nation, default to blind trust that 'they know what they're doing'.

Who knows if embarrassing details about Politician Y haven't been used to blackmail them into voting one way or another, resigning, defecting? Who knows what information is routinely stored about people in pressure groups, or how that information could be used to quash their efforts and discredit their organisation? If it all sounds too conspiratorial—which, granted, it may well be—, then consider that some government in the future less virtuous than we have been 'blessed' with in our age could trivially harness mass data retention to *do whatever they like*.

&gt;In one speech, the Government – using the Queen as their mouthpiece...

It's a silly bit of pomp and ceremony, but it's one of the features of how government works here. It doesn't really add anything, but the Queen reading out the government's plans isn't significant.

No one was saying, 'The Blair government - using the Queen as its mouthpiece... ' a decade ago.

I'll preface the next bit:

In theory I'm ** very much** in favour of unions. I day in theory, because every one I've been a member of has proven to be self-serving and entirely worthless to me.

&gt;In their Trade Unions Bills, the Tories announced that they would impose a 50% turnout threshold on strike ballots. 

This is a good thing. The right to strike is important, but it's also important that a strike is called with the fullest support of the strikers.

&gt;And for people working in “essential public services” – that’s anyone working in health, education, fire and transport – they have to be supported by 40% of those entitled to vote in order for a strike to be considered legal. 

An overwhelming mandate is needed before people in essential services strike. Sounds like a legitimate balance between the public good and the right to strike. I'm ok with this.


&gt;This they say is democratic – from a Government who just weeks ago won an election with the support of 24% of people eligible to vote.

Irrelevant. We **desperately** need electoral reform (in my opinion), but that fact doesn't mean something else is off the table. You could use the same stupid argument to claim the same government having only 24% support has no mandate to raise the national minimum wage.

&gt;And last year the TUC urged then Business Secretary Vince Cable to allow electronic voting in strike ballots – a measure they’ve been asking successive governments to push through for years. But the Tories aren’t interested.

Fuck me, that's a valid complaint. Who snuck that in?



&gt;Buried in the details of this bill is a proposal that wasn’t fully explained in the Tory manifesto: “a transparent opt-in process for the political fund element of of trade union subscriptions”. While the Tories said there’d be an opt-in process for union subscriptions, they didn’t specify the political levy.

Again, this is a good thing.  It's entirely unacceptable that a portion of the union dues of a Green, or UKIP, or Conservative voter's union dues are used to fund Labour. Promote union membership, publish interpretations of government policy (better interpretations than this, cheers), set up a political donation fund, of that's sheet you fancy. It **should** be optional and it **must** be transparent.

Aside from all the above, it's not like Labour are making much of an attempt to be the party of the workers anymore anyway. ",null,1,null,1432830872,null,0,false,0,crnserv,null,t3_37knnk,null,t1_crnserv,null,t3_37knnk,null,null,null,1433316889,null,-2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,-2,null

null,false,jaffa56,null,null,null,"I used to work for a car warranty company so might be of some assistance. If the car is over 3 years old the dealer doesn't have to give you any sort of warranty, but most will through extended warranty companies like Warranty 2000. Sometimes you might have to pay extra for this (did you?) sometimes they'll throw it in for 'free'. It should be listed on your invoice (especially if you paid extra for it) or in your paperwork. 
  
It's their responsibility to speak to warranty 2000 to set your warranty up, and they should have provided you with your policy information when you took the car away. If warranty 2000 are saying they have no record of the policy it's probably because the dealer has been slow to set it up, so speak to the dealer and get them to do this asap. 
  
As for what Warranty 2000 cover, this is down to their terms and conditions and is really up to them. If you paid for the warranty then you should have been given a copy of the terms and conditions first to peruse before buying. If it was 'free', then maybe not, although you should still have the policy documents. A manufacturers warranty on a new car will cover almost everything, but a used car warranty usually won't cover 'wear and tear' items like clutches, unless they suddenly break before they're expected to. 
  
The warranty company's terms and conditions will probably tell you which garages they will allow you to take the car to. So read that, and take it to another garage if necessary. Again, you *should* have been given this information when you bought the car. 
  
If they deny the claim you can take it up with their complaints process, but how much power you have depends on whether their warranty is an insurance product, as thus governed ultimately by the FCA and Financial Ombudsman, or an unregulated product and therefore entirely down to them. 
  
Hopefully that is of some use, but pm me if you have more questions and I'll do my best to help you out because all of these companies are unscrupulous at the best of times. 
  
The other option is to park your faulty BMW outside the dealership with signs in the window telling other customers of your problems with that dealership..

null,false,IfICanShootRabbits,null,null,null,"&gt; Compared to some English cities it's not very diverse - about 8% of the city's population is non-white Scottish/British as of 2013[1] 

I think there's a distinction to be made between diversity and multiculturalism. A diverse (by which I presume we're meaning non-white Scottish) doesn't necessarily mean a highly multicultural society; it can just mean a population or collection of monocultures. Parts of England are like that - you'll have a black area, an Asian area, a Chinese area, a poor white area and a rich white area, and none of them will mix. 

In Edinburgh, things seem much more integrated. Maybe it's just because we're a small city so things have to be, but where the likes of Manchester has things like its China Town  or the Curry Mile, both of which are pretty much exclusively Chinese or Asian, we've got the likes of Gorgie/Dalry, where a similar sort of footprint within a similar socioeconomic spectrum gives you Chinese, Polish, African, Indian, German, and British supermarkets, takeaways, hair dressers, and etc, all with a very mixed clientele. By the measure of white-Scots vs Other we might not rank especially high, but I think Edinburgh is a pretty excellent example of true multiculturalism, certainly in terms of mix and presence, if not volumes.

UKPASS (UK Postgraduate Application and Statistical Service) is run by UCAS (the UK's centralised undergraduate university application service) and includes many but not all postgraduate courses in the UK.

Normally, I wouldn't recommend looking at University league tables,  but it might be worth [familiarising](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings) yourself with the names of the various UK universities for your search. Don't feel be intimidated by their ranks or feel limited to the bottom 10 or 20, the table is incredibly subjective, and anywhere bar the top 30 will still usually accept people in some fields when they have lower grades.",null,0,null,1432834043,null,0,false,0,crnuhoo,null,t3_37m4ry,null,t1_crnuhoo,null,t3_37m4ry,null,null,null,1433317870,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

Borini: £5 million; Balotelli: £10 million; Lambert: £2 million, Aspas: £5 million; Alberto: £4 million; Coates: £4 million; Jose Enrique: £4 million. That's £34 million, and I think I'm undervaluing a few of them; fire sale and all that. I doubt Enrique will be sold and Balotelli won't want to move because he'll be stepping down again most likely and the wages will be less.

If they start dragging women out of cars then fair enough, throw the perpetrators in jail, but as it stands the most likely outcome is that women will weigh driving against their membership of a religious community and decide which is more important to them accordingly.

It's conceivable this will lead to some leaving the Chasidic tradition (though unlikely), but it's a very insular community and I struggle to think of examples of Chasidic or Charedi men or women who could *function* in the real world.

I'm perfectly on board with criticism, but I personally cannot think of a satisfactory way to resolve this, though I encourage any suggestions.

You can write a message without endorsing that message. They were not asked to endorse or agree with the concept of gay marriage, simply to write the words on a cake.

null,false,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"Pensions should be means tested. If you're on a basic pension it's not a lot of money but of course if you have your work pension plus your state pension you get off pretty well. The idea that my mother &amp; my uncle receive the same pension seems rather stupid to me, him having a private pension worth over £1 million &amp; her having no private pension at all. He obviously doesn't need that extra money. He's also receiving other benefits like the fuel allowance which seems equally ridiculous.

Of course this is all based on the idea that if you pay your NI contributions you should all receive the same benefits. I don't know where this idea came from because it's not the case with other kinds of benefits so why should it be so with pensions? National insurance should be seen as what it is, a tax on earnings, not as a pension fund. 

It's also not sustainable in it's current form. Government spending on pensions has increased from [2% of GDP in the 50s to over 8% that it is today](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_1950_2016UKp_14c1li111mcn_00t). How are we suppose to sustain these increases in spending as our population becomes more top heavy? How is it fair that previous generations could get by with low taxes while the current &amp; future generations have to pay higher taxes to pay for their pensions? They're not paying for these benefits, we are, the working age population. That's the problem with seeing it as a pension fund, if it actually was a fund then the burden wouldn't be on future generations but on the one receiving the benefit. 

If you look at what budget has been squeezed to pay for these increases in cost it is [primarily defence spending](http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/spending_chart_1950_2016UKp_14c1li011mcn_00t10t30t20t40t). However there's only so much defence spending can be cut, and we're getting towards the limit now. So where will the cuts come to pay for it? Welfare is likely, as we're already seeing, then probably the police budget, then education &amp; the inevitable tax rises.

&gt;The [Japanese Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Japan) states that ""there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race."" At least one native people-group (the [Ainu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people)) was formally recognized by the Japanese government for the first time in 1997. However, [foreign nationals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_national) who were born in Japan or elsewhere can be legally restricted from certain services and activities.  [*[not in citation given](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)*] According to census statistics, 98.5% of the population of Japan are Japanese, with the remainder being foreign nationals living in Japan.

I think this is key.  We've all seen how Rose went from a fairly average left back last year, to arguably one of the best in the league after he finally got some realistic competition for his spot (there's always the question of whether this is just a chance correlation, or if buying Davies actually caused Rose to up his game, but let us go with the popular narrative for the sake of argument).  In the same vein, Vertonghen's looked complacent to the point of inadequacy for a significant part of this season, and he wasn't exactly brilliant last year either.  If buying someone who looks like he could be a serious challenger for that left CB spot is what it takes to light a fire under Vert's ass and get him back to where he was a couple of seasons ago, it means we could be getting back the guy who has shown that, at his best, he can be one of the top centre backs in the league.",null,0,null,1432838128,null,0,false,0,crnx6rl,null,t3_37lwyv,null,t1_crnx6rl,null,t3_37lwyv,null,null,null,1433319141,null,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5,null

&gt; how much interest I'll be paying if I'm £500 overdrawn on 16.8% EAR?

16.8% is a per year rate, so one month is 1.168^(1/12) - 1 = 1.3% (roughly equal to 16.8 / 12). So you'll pay £6.50 per month on £500.

null,false,BenW1994,null,null,null,"Seems like a generally decent plan. I would do things ever so slightly differently:

*  You should aim to have an emergency fund at all times, in case of an unexpected and urgent expenses. While it seems like you can borrow money from your parents 1) that means it's not immediate 2) are you comfortable borrowing money from them to pay off a speeding ticket, or whatever? I'd recommend keeping £500 easily accessible at all times.

* Your overdraft won't start charging you until September. So don't pay off the debt until you have to - they've given you a free loan until then, keep it for as long as possible. As long as you're switched on about it (which you seem to be), there's no point giving them money before you have to. Perhaps set up an automatic payment to go out of your account so you don't forget - but this gives you a little more flexibility if needed. You could follow this advice all the way to 2016 if you want.

* Take the pension match as soon as possible (assuming that you need to contribute to get their match?). It's automatically going to make 100% profit - very few debts will cost that much, so it's almost always preferable. It also sets you up into a good habit.

* Just as a general point, I'm assuming you use a debit card from your old student account as a day to day card? I would recommend opening a second account, and setting an automatic payment for the £500 to go there. Then you know that that money is not for spending, it's for putting to one of your goals. This means you never 'see' it, it's always going straight where it needs to, making paying debt back less painful.

Liverpool went 4 years without champions league football and still managed to finish 2nd(and to attract the players necessary to do so) after that.  Also I think everyone is over estimating the revenue stream from champions league football.  Yes it is a great boost, but the money can be made up in different ways.  

Liverpool made 2 cup semis this year with a chance to win both(with a flawed team).  Is that not challenging for trophies?  Like I said before I do think Liverpool need to change their transfer committee and adjust the wage structure to allow them to sign some higher wage players once in a while.  I however don't believe that there is a magical date that if Liverpool doesn't do xyz by they will fall into mediocrity forever.  Liverpool has failed to expand their stadium,  capitalize on the global revenue streams or have a great transfer record for what 10-15 years?  Yes changes will help, but if Liverpool doesn't make the top 4 next year its not the end of football in Liverpool.

ISTR the outgoing message is encrypted several times - with the public key of every device that's registered for iMessage - and then sent. You can see if you register a new device, it doesn't get your old messages - only new ones. That's because your old messages were never encrypted with its key.

The police could calculate the known distance between a certain combination of cameras on the road, and the time taken, and from that generate an average speed for the journey. 

Comparing that to other vehicles on the same road wouldn't be in the least bit helpful. She either is, or is not, above the average speed. 

If she is above it, then it doesn't in the least bit matter what the other drivers were doing from the point of view of her prosecution, she cannot possibly have obeyed the speed limit. But it tells us nothing of how far in excess she was at any given time, which is largely what an accident investigator is going to want to know. The speed limit may be 70, she may have an average speed of 85. But that doesn't tell us whether she spent 10 miles at 40 followed by 5 miles at 160, or the whole distance at 85. (Figures pulled from ass by the way, to illustrate the point)

If her average isn't above the speed limit, then its still entirely possible that she was still speeding, but that at some point unseen during the journey she must have slowed down to such an extent as to balance out the average speed.

Also the minimum wage is recommended by the Low Pay Commission which is independent, the government has actually increased the minimum wage above the recommended amount.

given your age, its the best time to come. you'd have to have some balls to move here alone AND go into that kind of work at a young age as your first job, esp in a new country, but provided you're an outgoing person, just do it.

one day, you'll be 40 and unable to, cos you have kids, and uni, and a mortgage and a cat and oh my god, where did my life go?

do it now while you've none of that.  dont like it? fine, its not for life. move back to NSW. no dramas.

can you find ut whether there are jobs in other laces in the uk? if so, you could move somewhere smaller (cheaper, friendlier) here, like brighton, aka, london by the sea, cos so many londoners move there and commute back. its a cool seaside city, w a large student population so feels younger than london.
bristol, exeter, manchester, newcastle~  (they’re all uni cities, so have a  ton written on them) are worth a thought too.
if it were me, id opt for a smaller city, as being easier to find my feet in a new country, as well as friendlier. if you like london, you can then move here.

if you regard it as work for a year, 2 years, its less intimidating than thinking its for 5 years or life.

https://www.reddit.com/r/aussieexpats/ ask some aussies about life here.
expensive, cloudy, sure, but also worth it. you're young. do stuff, have adventures, make mistakes; just get out there (but like, safely).

london itself? variable.i love it; i have total freedom, its endlessly varied. if you're from a small town and like a close knit circle of friends on your doorstep, head for a smaller city. one of the main reasons people love london is for the career opportunity; that kind of thing makes the downsides worthwhile. so for you, thats less of an issue.

you dont really have to worry about job prospects as there are always jobs for you, but lack of jobs creates a depression in those around you, so it will effect you a bit. the recession isn't hugely noticeable in london; its worse up north, but improving. the rest of the south is recovering. if you hear people your age here complain about lack of jobs, remember its different to your situation.

He missed training due to minor ailments, why does the tweet make it look like he's just missing training? Lack of application can mean that he doesn't make the correct runs. It isn't lack of application like he's just skipping training sessions.

The lack of rotations made the team very tired in the second part of the season, especially Kroos. Also, he has made very bad substitutions in the matches IMO, and he lets the media control the team (a thing that happens a lot in Real), unlike José, he does whatever makes happy the media and the president, for example, making Casillas play every single game, just like Ramos and Benzema (I'm not saying they are bad, just that they almost always are in the starting 11, even if they are in bad form).

You didn't put MvG as the 10 but you did put him in a more advanced position than MvG, it just makes very little sense considering MvG is a box to box midfielder whilst Charly is naturally more advanced, yet you have them in the reversed positions and then have RLC has an MR?.

Tammy is not a winger lmao. The only time he plays on the wing is when him and Solanke play together.

Exactly. It's all very well saying you trust the government now (why you would say that I don't know but hey) but that's not the most significant risk. The gamble your taking is that there won't be an authoritarian crazy person voted in before the laws are repealed and as the laws seem next to impossible to repeal your talking about many many successive government's maybe over 50-100 years. How do you know you can trust them all? How do you even know what political party they will belong to and what values they will hold? They will have all the power Cameron has, all the power he's going to give himself and all the power the other successive governments are going to give themselves over the years all stacked on top of the past power, all at their disposal.

null,false,zephyrus-,null,null,null,"re the working hours; afaik, you can also work full time in holidays (vacations), which’d allow you to earn bit more, but even so, its mega expensive for international students. have you emailed any units to ask them about this??

this is the international students page from bristol uni~ http://www.bristol.ac.uk/international/countries/usa.html you'd earn a minimum wage of £6.50ph upwards in subway, macdonalds etc. thats about $10 an hour :/

i cant imagine the 20 hrs in term time law changing, but the holiday job rules may change before you arrive. you get free healthcare, optical and dentistry work while you're here, too, which’d take costs down a bit if you're calculating things right now. its always good to plan ahead : )

bath and brizzle (local pronunciation for bristol) are really nice; bristol over bath, for being cooler, friendlier, more fun. they're a short train trip apart, so you can have tea at the roman baths in Bath every weekend if you like ; )

have you thought which area of law you'd like to enter?
if you're considering international law, or something pertaining to that (human rights something something) it might be viable to study here, but yeah, as everyone has said; our law is our law, so irrelevant in the states.
in medicine you'd just do a conversion course to become licensed back home, but law is contingent, not universal, so a trickier transfer.

if you want to enter a specific area of law, like music rights, or work in the arts or something, you could chose music, art history etc as your course here, without hinderance.

finding jobs would really come down to finding stuff *while* you're here. your uni will help a bit, but cant place everyone. get a british driving license when you come, have a clean criminal record, and you'd be safe for baby sitting etc.

the other popular money raiser for students is medical research. its controlled by the government, so its not like you'd be heading off to organ stealers in some sketchy warehouse. when i was a student, my flat mate paid his way through uni doing this; some trials’d be a few 100, others were £2k, tho scary drugs like heart transplant ones, over several weekends. relatively easy money, tho.

the other option is market research. its unpredictable, so regard it as pocket money. you can get up to £50 for an hour, being asked about a web sites, or your shopping habits. search for ‘research’ on the gumtree.com for whatever area you move to.

gumtree is house/flat rentals, sales etc, as well as the rest of life. the jobs section is huge; thats what you want. tbh, i cant imagine many people hiring someone they've never met, esp for unskilled work, so yeah; get an idea from it, but expect to interview once you come over.
university departments also conduct research, esp psychology students, so you can earn about £8 an hour untaxed for looking at faces on a computer etc, or doing weird tests.

for better advice on law, ask your current tutors about studying abroad. there is a british student site, the student room, which has subs by subject- so ask in ‘law’, as well as advice for internationals, so ask there re jobs.

Please can we not be naive about Isis, salafism has coalsed into a state its making *serious* gains in Syria now and seriously might come out ahead of a few other groups in victory.

Then you have Libya, which is getting worse by the day.

Only relatively good news is that since Boko haram joined up, Nigeria started getting its shit together. 

These are not some foriegn threat a bazillgion miles away. Brown people on the news problems.

One remarkably resistant to airstrikes. 

They are winning a multi front war, with the U.S bombing them, they sure as hell are aiming to attack outside of their territory, we are definitely seeing that in Libya already. Are they motivating enabling attacks in places like France or Belgium. Probablly not much if at all at the moment. But are they ideologically willing and logistically capable of doing so. Yes. It's a state, it can fund epsionage. States like Gaddafi's Libya did this well in the past. It's totally doable. 

It also has commanders capable enough, again to stand against Hezbollah, guys who can give the Israeli army a run for its money. And to contiually out manuver the Iraqi (shit morale, corrupt as fucked, but well equiped and lots of training from USA and us) to the point where swathes of territory are being lost and regiments almost entirely lost. 

Let's please get real about how fucked this all is. These people are a threat moderated by their logistical capacity to hurt someone at any given moment. It's not some Fox news invented threat.
