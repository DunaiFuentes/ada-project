- Well who knows what goes on behind the scenes but there are likely agreements in place that Greece will get further extensions (essentially debt relief) if they follow the terms imposed by the troika. 
- Greece has money, they just have to choose what to cut to pay off their obligations. 
- It's not. Greece actually hasn't received much money from the troika to fund government spending. Almost all of it went on restructuring the debt &amp; paying off private banks. If the troika were to fund Greece's 15% deficit it would have cost substantially more. Plus as I said before it's not politically feasible, so it's rather pointless to talk about. I never said this austerity was the best option just that it was the only option. 
- Not necessarily, default does not mean the debt disappears, it is still there, waiting to be repaid. Perhaps there would be a restructuring after default though who knows, they wouldn't be in the EZ any more either way. Talking about past German debt isn't helpful, this isn't their debt this is EZ debt, they just happen to be the largest single guarantor. Besides the EU states have already paid vast sums to Greece. Let's not forget that since joining the EU they have received 104 billion Euros, more than any other country.
- The IMF doesn't have to deal with the EU electorate. Just because something is the right thing to do doesn't mean it's politically feasible to do it.  

I feel like this is rather pointless to argue over. All I'm saying is that debt forgiveness or gifting money isn't politically feasible.

I love Lamela and i know he's very good, he's one of my favorite players for us and I'm really hoping this year he'll really show what he's made of. 

I didn't call Werner a failed signing or someone that won't bed in. I just said if we go for him we need to be prepared for the possibility of him not bedding in his first year. We can't have two strikers (assuming Ade &amp;amp; Soldado out, Werner in) and think we'll do well.

It's bizarre how different Doctor Who was that first Pertwee year compared to what had come before, and what was to come throughout the rest of his era.

Maybe it wouldn't have been as popular with the kids at the time as the Master stories coming down the road (I don't have access to ratings to confirm) but it certainly spun the show in a whole new direction at a time when the-powers-that-be at the BBC felt the show needed to either get its act together or be rested.

Failing that, I have a real soft spot for Season 18 (Tom Baker's last). I'm not sure if that's because of how old I was at the time, or whether it's the Bidmeadian hard-science that was weaved throughout.

I certainly remember as a youngster not enjoying Season 17 much at all because of its OTT jokiness (even as a ten year old I was wincing at Horns of Nimon) and was longing for a return to the Hinchcliffe era of scares.  So Season 18 was very refreshing.

There's been a new housing development built to replace the old derelict terraces, but it's only been open a year or so and already there's plywood over smashed windows, overgrown gardens, litter, graffiti, old sofas and washing machines left on the pavement. some new office blocks have been put up in the town centre but they're mostly empty, as are the old ones that were already there.

There's plans for a big redevelopment project for the docklands which theoretically will see lots of shiny new flats and businesses built, but I'm not getting my hopes up yet.

First match in the Prem:

Stoke City (which we won)

My thoughts are that while it kind of looks like a more difficult pre-season, I think it's about equal to what we've done this season. Obviously, the first half is essentially equivalent. Olympiacos was Gerrard's testimonial and while treated like a normal friendly, still featured Fowler, Carra, etc.

The loss away to Celtic seems the only real difference, but the starting team was Mignolet, Enrique, Wisdom, Toure, Johnson, Lucas, Gerrard, Allen, Downing, Aspas, Coutinho with subs being  Jones, Alberto, Assaidi, Henderson, Sturridge, Coates, Borini, Sterling, Kelly, Flanagan, Ibe.

* people who aren't having to worry about getting kicked out of their jobs by a vote.


* a broad spectrum of people who know about the world

The question is whether having random people is effective as a check. I argue it often would be because there's no way that a random selection of people will vote in favour of certain laws - they will weigh the pros and cons more effectively than whipped politicians.

The trouble with the Lords at the moment is that its being stuffed with political appointees and ex-politicians (along with a smattering of experts for show). The end result will be a political house which is as big a mistake as having an elected house (which depending on the majority would end up either agreeing with everything the commons says and not fulfilling its role, or disagreeing with everything the commons says and obstructing the commons, neither of which are useful).


What would sortition do badly though? As you alluded to, a random selection of the population might lack expertise in particular areas. Also you might argue that they might be too easily lead by the press. Still I'm not convinced that this is worse than an elected house - I'd rather get rid of the Lords completely than have an elected house.

Granted, our major expenditure is his nursery but we're fortunate to have salary sacrifice schemes at wok which work in our favour. He's in for 4 days a week and it currently comes in at £590 per month, minus the SS.

Once he hits a smidge after 3 we get an additional level of free childcare from the Govt which will be a nice wee rebate. Once he starts school we just have to worry about getting a decent childminder for pick ups and it's all gravy.

Little dude eats pretty much what we do, we buy his clothes from nearly new sales. Days out are easy at this age as he's happy feeding the ducks, razzing round a free museum or hooning about the park. 

I have no doubt that he'll cost me a quid or two in the future but the payback's immeasurable. I get a ready made little mate who's always up for a laugh, thinks I'm amazing and can turn a dogshit day around with a ""Hi Daddy!"".

In relation to the article, I guarantee you that I will be that parent. I have a rather dogged disposition and was planning whilst he was still in the womb - Every option at my disposal will be employed to ensure that he gets every opportunity over someone else's kids.

But that's where the good ends.

Shithole. Not much to do if you aren't into country activities, closest cinema is 20ish miles away for example. The shopping centre they opened in 2007 still has at least 4 unused units and it already looks run down and poorly maintained.

The Tesco is always busy and has the most poorly thought out entrance I've ever experienced and getting to and from Anglesey at rush-hour is oddly difficult thanks to traffic and a terrible merging system on one bridge and the obvious limitations of the other (nothing compared to other cities, but considering the population of the area).

If you've committed a crime and want to know what your criminal record says, I imagine that would be different. But you'll have been told what you were charged with. 

Disclosures rarely actually tell an employer anything that isn't relevant to the job you're applying to. For example, if you work in a care home for the elderly, your employer can ask for a disclosure, but the disclosure will not contain any information that wouldn't be relevant to working with the elderly (e.g. if you had abused a minor) because it would be illegal to unnecessarily disclose that information with no clear indication that it's relevant to your job. (Having said that there's a human in the police force/disclosure service deciding what to disclose, so that does vary).

If you are applying to a job and they tell you they need you to ""have"" a DBS certificate, you need to prompt them to put your application in. It isn't your responsibility to check, but more than that  - what they disclose is tailored to the job. So whatever they disclose it needs to come from them, with their description of what the job entails.

Also, if you do get a check done with that company, other companies shouldn't ask you for it/use it. As I said, it's tailored to the job so even if the jobs are similar, DBS tell people it should always be done again for the different job.

Source: used to process DBS checks for a charity.

Edit: Just to clarify, LOADS of employers don't know about this and don't bother to find out the rules around DBS. A lot of them will ask you to have a DBS without ever checking whether they are legally allowed to check you. If you're not working with vulnerable groups e.g. elderly, children, you don't. If you might ""bump into some kids during work"" but it's not actually your main job (e.g. working in a shop and kids come in) that's still not requiring a DBS.

Logitech Harmony Touch remote control (£80) - sealed never been opened, 

Blue SnowBall Omnidirectional (£45)- used occasionally but picked up a headset with mic and haven't used the snowball since. Still have the original box. ***Reserved for RedstoneOpenDoor pending meetup to trade items***

Logitech G13 gamepad (£35) - purchased it secondhand but the seller never indicated it came from a smoking home as such it's sat in a the box, 

Saitek X55 Rhino (£120)- purchased to play Elite Dangerous but then GTA V came out and only used it maybe 3 times. Still have the original box and extra springs

Sennheiser HD 449 (£40)- sealed and never been opened.

Postage to be added on top of the above prices, and payment to be done via Bank Transfer, if you have any questions let me know! If anyone wanted to trade somethings let me know, ~~I'm looking for a K70 RGB with Cherry MX Browns or a Ducky Shine 3 MX Browns.~~

Prices can be negotiated these are just a ball park figure that I've taken from the lowest price on Amazon. 

I'm based in london so collection is an option. 

Thanks for looking!

When I was growing up in the areas around the main high street (Holton Rd) it was prosperous and the community was great. You knew everyone, and although there were a couple of thug families around who loved to cause trouble, it was one of the best parts of my life.

20 years ago, being a chav was starting to be a thing, crime stats rocketed, businesses moved out and now it's a [run-down shithole](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.408216,-3.257832,3a,75y,134.9h,77.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1syJwvDtHT6-cTDBLn-sPG6A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).

There's some development going on towards the waterfront but it's mostly your typical new-style houses with tiny rooms.

The new housing will become more of a problem in the future because Barry has virtually no jobs except the Dow Corning silicon implant factory, and there are only two main roads into Cardiff, both of which have miles of traffic jams every weekday morning.

It's fucking grim, and the only good thing to come out of it was Gavin &amp; Stacey.

In Britain we've got a media that's nothing better than elite propaganda, that wants to narrow the terrain of acceptable ideological opinion down to a few approved positions that offer no threat to the powerful or well-to-do. 

When someone says ""he's not electable"" in the press you should translate it as ""he's a threat to our class interests"" because that's what they're saying. To even countenance the potential existence of another way of thinking is impossible for them, and is a threat even to the right, because it undermines the [TINA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_no_alternative) that they rely on. 

In order to accept neo-liberal austerity as normal, and everything outside of that is irrational and extremist, it's better for the Tories to have a Liz Kendall type who accepts the fundamental premise of Tory ideology and just wants to implement it in a more socially responsible way. That means that the centre ground moves more to the right, and that ultimately strengthens the Tories and the vested interests they represent, and weakens the left, in the long-term (as Blairism found out sometime in the mid-2000's)

Nah, you're just misinterpreting my post. I never said you said Werner would be a failed signing, I said your reaction and likening him to the signing of Lamela shows little faith and a whole lot of reluctance.

27 years old is not a veteran. And those players you're talking about that are in our squad like Vertonghen, Dembélé, Lloris, (Lennon) ALL have been with us since before they were 25. I think the word your looking for is experienced not veteran. 

We can and probably will deal with only 2 strikers, assuming Bobby and Adebayor leave. Last season we basically relied on Harry after November, it was nearly like we only had one striker. It's not ideal, but Jesus fuck it's better than signing Louis bloody Saha for the piss of it.

If I had to pick one out of the bunch, it would be Gomez. I personally hadn't heard much of him before he signed for Liverpool, and I didn't expect much from him. Actually said in some previous thread that he would be sent out on loan with Ilori staying as the backup. At this point though, Gomez looks lime someone who can compete for a place in the starting XI in cup and EL games. His composure in defense for his age is great.

Ibe has a lot of hype around him, and the preseason has just kept the hype levels up. I'd place my money on this season being his breakout season, if given a decent amount of game time.

Milner and Lallana are both ""veterans"" of sorts, having been in the game for a while now. Milner is proven class, but Lallana had a bit of a stop-start season last year, mostly due to his injuries. But he's brilliant, can score, assist, beat a man with skill, and keeps possession. Also fantastic hair. If he stays healthy this season, I can see him starting in a attacking mid trio of him, Couts, and Firmino,  or in the wings in a 4-3-3, and bag about 6-10 goals.

null,false,colinsteadman,null,null,null,"I bought that book.  One of the first things I remember cooking was her [meatballs and spaghetti](http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/cuisine/european/italian/meatballs-with-spaghetti-and-fresh-tomato-sauce.html).  It took me fricking hours (all afternoon and evening) and I used every pot and pan in the kitchen.  By the end I was really stressed out and aching from tiredness.

These days I can make the same dish in about 45 minutes flat and only use a bowl, couple of pots and a frying pan.  I also dont read the recipe, and only glance at it to see what ingredients I need and in approximately what proportions.  

For example it says use 225g of pork mince, I just use whatever is in the pack of minced pork I buy.  It says 95g of mortadella bacon.  I just chop up 4 rashers of smoked bacon (or whatever bacon I actually have) and lob that in.  2 tablespoons of grated Parmesan... I just break off a thumb sized lump off the block of parmasan, grate it and throw it in... no idea how many tablespoons it is.  

And as for the tomato sauce... thats what took all the time last time, removing the skins, making it into a sauce ect... These days its a nice tin of chopped tomatoes, olive oil, salt, sugar... some kind of acid (lemon juice, wine vinegar, balsamic... ect) and some tomato puree, brought to the boil and simmered for a few minutes until slight thickened.  

The results are always better than my first try and it feels effortless.  A friend of mine once told me, if you use quality ingredients and dont do anything stupid, the results are always going to be pretty good!  So just get in there and give it a shot.

Also, some insights I that took me a while to figure out.  Use ingredients like you use salt on chips or fries.  You dont measure the amount of salt on chips, you just put the amount on you need for the quantity of chips you have.  If you were making a cheese sandwich, you use the amount of cheese appropriate for a sandwich.  Or sauce on a hotdog.  Do this with every ingredient and you'll start to instinctively use the right amounts for what your recipe needs!

Two.  Heat!  If you're frying something in oil you want to see some bubbling around the sides.  Not to fast, not too slow.  This took me an age to figure out because watching cooking shows they just talk about, have a medium heat or a high heat... what does that mean?  I think watching and listening to the food is a better indicator of how much heat you need.

Good luck and all the best of your journey.  I dont have an ounce of natural skill or affinity with cooking, and I dont particularly enjoy doing it.  What I do like is eating really good food, so I always try my best to get better and better.... and after 20 years of it... I'm OK.  All the best!

Couple of griddled chicken breasts, cooked with some butter, garlic and parsley (even shop bought garlic butter will do) buy an £8 griddle pan from Asda and a £1 meat thermometer if you want to be cautious. Cook your chicken in there.

Make a jacket spud, (5 mins in microwave, 40-60 mins in the oven)

Make rice and peas to go with it, I prefer frozen petit pois because they're sweeter. Stick them in a bowl of rice with a knob of butter. You can also add mushrooms if you like.

I made this for our kids one day when they asked what the first thing I made their dad. We now have it once a week! It's really filling, and dirt cheap to make.

The first thing my SO cooked for me was, a packet of bachelors savoury rice, cooked and then some bacon bits and scrambled egg mixed in, with a sweet jacket potato. 
Also 'pizza toast' which was basically a garlic and coriander shop bought naan bread, with (insert whatever ingredients you want) and some shredded cheese.  You could try this with some just-roll while learning.

You can do a basic tuna pasta salad by mixing a tin of tuna, tomatoes, cucumber, red pepper, red onion, sweet corn mix it all together with mayonnaise, black pepper and lemon juice, and then add warm fusilli pasta. I make huge tubs of this, it will go with most things and can be eaten hot or cold.

One tip, is to go get  and buy a kg pack of chicken breast (£6.50 last time I looked) buy a packet of rice, a packet of pasta, 5 herbs, 5 spices, stock cubes some potatoes and just experiment! 
The stuff I mention is really basic, and lazy but it's a place to start if you aren't confident. 

Also, my guilty pleasure is roasting bags. I usually use them for joints of meat, but they have other uses. Stick some seared meat (chicken, pork, diced beef)  and a load of vegetables into the bag, and put it into the oven as a cheap sort of crock pot.

As others have mentioned, BUY A SLOW COOKER/CROCKPOT! Put stuff in, in the morning, come home to a cooked meal and your house smelling awesome!

I'm on mobile, so this is probably formatted horribly, but there's a lot of good tips in this thread.
Also check out /r/food. Lots of recipes, and not all of them complicated.

One last thing. Buy a cast iron pan. About £25-£35 from Amazon, you absolutely won't regret it.

Edit: figured I might as well throw in tonights dinner.

I'd be in favour of a vast redistribution of the world's wealth so that the incentive to move, point a), is weakened. I'd also be in favour of not intervening in places like Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan since that has increased the number of refugees from those countries immensely. This coupled with a proper legal process for legal citizenship is the best way to deal with mass immigration, which unfortunately for some is a fact of life now. The old Britain of 99% or so white ""anglo-saxon"" is gone forever and you might feel a twinge of nostalgia for it but it's never coming back, the days of having ethnically exclusive nation-states is a relic of a previous age.

Simultaneously I don't have a problem with immigrants, foreigners, non-British, non-white people etc living here at all. I don't care for any sort of arbitrary cap or limit, and I certainly don't support deporations and imprisonment I think that's inhumane and disgusting. We should be willing to take in as many people as we can feasibly manage, and have proper processes in place to deal with large-scale immigration, since this is something that's only in it's early stages it's only going to be more intense as the 21st century progresses.

null,false,scottish_beekeeper,null,null,null,"I was originally uncertain about the introduction of presumed liability for motorists, but having reviewed the available literature and considered the arguments for and against, I have to say I am now in favour.

The main argument that swayed it for me is the potential harm that can be brought about by the different forms of vehicle.

Currently, in an accident where neither party is 'at fault', each bears their own costs. For the driver, this is almost always financial - painting and panel-beating but for the cyclist or pedestrian, this is much more likely to be physical injury and perhaps death.  It seems unreasonable to say ""that's life"" and not in some way make the driver more responsible for the greater injury they can cause.

If the change in law makes it so that for motorists the change is 'drive much more defensively and more considerately around vulnerable road users or risk having raised insurance premiums' and for cyclists and pedestrians the change is 'be much less likely to die' then I'm all in favour.

Bear in mind that this is not just a car versus cyclist issue, it's also potentially a lorry versus motorbike, or cyclist versus pedestrian issue. The more dangerous vehicle takes the brunt of the cost of damaging the more vulnerable one. This could lead to other changes that would make road use safer for everyone - cyclists taking out insurance against hitting pedestrians, lorries avoiding busy town centres, etc.

Exact opposite of TL:DR; but this blog post also covers some of these issues (possibly doing a better job than me!) http://www.happycyclist.org/?p=429

Interestingly, the more reputable an outlet was, there were fewer, if not a handful of eyewitness reports which later turned out to be false. The ones that did turn out to be untrue were attributed to reporting from other outlets. 

Also, given the bombings a few weeks before, and the attempted bombings earlier that day, I believe the eye witnesses drew assumptions about Jean Charles because of the media's negative portrayal of Muslims generally at the time (which hasn't necessarily abated) and told journalists what they wanted to hear. For example, the reports of a man jumping over the ticket barriers may have actually been a police officer, as it was not Jean Charles. There were huge untruths, such as the person who reported seeing someone wearing a heavy padded jacket with wires coming out of it, which was the hollywood interpretation of a terrorist, rather than fact.

I also felt that the 24 hour news cycle was to blame for a lot of the speculation and misinterpretations of the day - news which will come as a surprise to no one who has any interest in current affairs.

--
&gt;Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable.

&gt;...the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums.

I do think that second point more applies to the US, however.

That's why I don't think it will happen, but even if it did I honestly fail to see how it will ever succeed. The sad fact is that, regardless of economic system, there will always be inequality as Orwell critiqued in Animal Farm. ""Everyone is equal, but some are more equal than others.""

Also, competition and the free markets are a big driving factor for innovation. It's why, to this day, drug companies are largely US-based rather than in the more socialist Europe, for example. Competition between companies is what leads us to our improving smartphones, the development of better drugs, etc. Socialism or any form of Marxism often detracts from that.

Finally, however heartless it might sound, the fact is that we're not all equal (or at least none of us perceive ourselves so).

You do realise this vision of the 70's as a place where the dead don't get buried and where there's never any electricity are based on Sun headlines, don't you? The story about ""the dead piling up"" for example was based on one strike at one graveyard in one part of the country and which was then turned into a massive media campaign by the Sun. 

The sort of version of the 1970's you're talking about has absolutely no relation to the actual history - it's a narrative that's been cobbled together out of decades-old Sun headlines, not one based on an accurate history. 

For example for all the strikes we had in the 1970's (which I'm quite fine with tbh) employment didn't once, even during the peak of the winter of discontent, go above 5%. Unemployment today, after 4 years of Tory recovery is higher than it was uner Jim Callaghan. We had full universal education to PhD level that was free of charge, fully funded public services that excluded no-one, we had nationalised industry that could provide jobs that was dismantled not because it was unproductive but because Thatcher wanted to destroy the trade union movement and replace our manufacturing economy with an economy based on finance capital and the City of London. We had the strongest trade union movement in our history, with 13 million members at it's peak, which led to high real-terms wages for workers as well as reducing inequality down to it's lowest levels on record. We had council houses that were cheap and available to all who needed them, as well as public infrastructure that maintained a basic level of welfare for all citizens.

Quite frankly, speaking as someone who when they left university in 2010/11 to a world with double-digit unemployment, 25%+ youth unemployment, staggering on from the worst recession since the 1930's, with a broken safety net, zero-hours contracts, terrible working conditions and shit wages, no council houses and extortionate rents, sub-standard public services that have been outsourced to private sector parasites, not to mention we have things like climate change and environmental degradation to cope with as well, compared to all that the problems of the 1970's are fucking quaint.

Quite frankly the economic and social problems our generation is having to deal with are much, much more severe than the problems of the 1970's. I'd wish we had those kinds of trivial problems, the problems of working-class people being too powerful rather than the problems of the banks and the City being too powerful, which is what we have today.",null,0,null,1437947107,null,0,false,0,cth2ik9,null,t3_3enf3a,null,t1_cth2ik9,null,t1_cth1ht8,null,null,null,1440101199,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Thats a ridiculous thing to say when you consider that its virtually impossible to meet a native Londoner down here (I'm exaggerating, but you know what I mean). I've lived in a few places and regularly visit cities up and down the country, and London is miles ahead in all the metrics that I care about. I could easily move to many other cities in the UK and have a perfectly happy life, but London is bloody amazing if you do it right and you are into the things it is so great for. I'm a little bit lucky though as my flat looks out on Victoria Park, so it's mega peaceful and calming and in a cracking part of the city, I felt very differently about London when I lived in Camberwell.

But yeah, the idea that everyone who loves London has never left London... don't be silly.

The Conservatives have a few built-in advantages to their position, that's why they are so good at winning.

Firstly, the basic psychology of aging - people are generally prone to become more resistant to change and favour the status quo the older they get, this being a big advantage for the Conservatives, as conserving the status quo is generally what they're about. Ever wonder why people have spent the last sixty years talking about how the Tories will fall from power when the current generation of pensioners die? Because they keep being replaced with new Tory-voting pensioners. Older people are also far more likely to vote, with massively higher turnout than any other demographic.

They have also managed to successfully manufacture a false perception of them being a ""safe"" party to have in charge at times of crisis. People equate them with ""things will be ok"" and trust them to keep us safe (for some reason).

Interestingly, from a recent conference I was at, there was a superb talk from an analyst who showed one very clear thing - that actually, quite a few people with left-wing ideology *actually vote Tory*. It was suggested that this was for the reason of them being considered a ""safe option"".

So, you have the elderly vote with their massive turnout, and people finding them safe.

The best bet to be noticed? **Be different**. Nobody is going to suddenly think ""wow! what a great movement!"" from just carrying on with the same Blairite policies. The momentum comes from the change. The momentum comes from **something new** being put forward. To most people who can be convinced to change their stance, this is very much something new.

Just take a look at social media. Look at the momentum building behind Corbyn. There's a reason he is the one everyone is talking about. There's a reason he has triple the facebook likes of any other candidate. If you don't elect him, that momentum will disappear, or likely even transfer to another party willing to take that step.

null,false,mitch1975,null,null,null,"I am a bit behind on redditiquette and don't use TL:DR, I assume it means simple explanation here. The link took me to another cyclist blog and I read arguments I had heard before, similar to yours.  
I still disagree on a basic level that it shifts the burden of proof from ""innocent unless guilty"" to the reverse, but to further the discussion I will address your points. I don't see how it would lead to a change in driving style.  
I ride a bike, own a car (used to own 2 and will do again soon), and drive a HGV for work. So there are three scenarios...  
When I am on my bike I avoid pedestrians as I am human, and so are the pedestrians. I understand mistakes happen and occasionally contact occurs (not to me ( so far)), how would someone prove the cyclist wasn't at fault? Nearest witnesses will almost certainly be accompanying the pedestrian and hardly likely to blame their mate. Are helmet cams going to become standard equipment? I don't have bike insurance (its a cheap bike) so would I be liable for damages myself and lose my house just because I couldn't prove someone walked out on me?    

When in my car I drive according to my natural style, 1 blameworthy accident in 29 years of holding a licence means I cant be that bad. That style doesn't change according to my insurance premium, it changes according to location, the traffic level, road condition, weather, etc. I only consider insurance costs at time of renewal. Also I have no cameras on my car, if this came in would I have to buy front and rear just to protect myself from a invalid claim?  
When at work in a HGV again I drive according to my natural style, I am assessed by each site I work at monitored by the onboard systems which report back heavy acceleration, heavy braking, speed (and location so speed limits can be monitored). I get a report on my MPG but I don't really care as I don't pay for fuel. Nowhere in that list is insurance cost, I don't know the cost and I don't pay it, its irrelevant to a HGV driver and negligible to a company (£15per hour for me, 9.5 mpg, £100k for truck and trailer, a few extra hundred a year for insurance is nothing). Also I have limited control over choice of route. I go where I am told. Trucks will be where they need to be, its a working vehicle.  
  
.  
I don't see how this change would make a difference to peoples behaviour, if a person is only going to be careful around others to save themselves a few quid once a year then they are not a human being. Now we both know people like that do exist and they should be punished by the law more than they currently are, but don't accuse everyone of being one just because they are in a car.  
Also as I said before, it switches the fundamental basis of UK law from innocent unless proven guilty around. That's wrong, and if you are accepting that in traffic are you going to accept it in other areas?

&gt; HARRIET HARMAN has been urged to suspend the Labour leadership race after evidence emerged that hard left infiltration is fuelling a huge surge in party membership.

&gt; More than 140,000 new activists are projected to have joined by the deadline for registration to vote, a rise of more than two thirds since the election, with many signing up to back the hard left candidate Jeremy Corbyn.

&gt; The Communist party of Great Britain has called on supporters to join and back Corbyn as part of its revolutionary “strategy” while Green party activists have also been discussing how to vote for him.

&gt; Labour MPs say their local parties have been flooded with new members, most of them supporting Corbyn, the MP for Islington North, who polls have suggested is the frontrunner in the leadership race.

&gt; Some of the new members have previously stood as candidates for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, an electoral alliance including the Socialist Workers’ party, founded by Bob Crow, the late hard left leader of the RMT rail union.

&gt; A veteran of Labour’s ruling national executive committee said: “It is pretty clear that what is happening amounts to infiltration of the Labour party.” Shadow cabinet ministers have privately admitted they are worried about those who are joining.

&gt; John Mann, the Bassetlaw MP, said the contest was “out of control, it is totally out of control” and called for Harman, the acting leader, to suspend it so proper checks could be conducted on new members.

&gt; “It should be halted. It is becoming a farce with longstanding members . . . in danger of getting trumped by people who have opposed the Labour party and want to break it up, expressly want to break it up — some of it is the Militant Tendency types coming back in.”

&gt; The call came as the Labour donor Assem Allam warned that the party would be out of power for at least a decade unless David Miliband returned as leader.

&gt; “The only way I am prepared to accept it will be five years is if David Miliband comes back and wins his seat in a constituency and is elected leader of the party,” he said.

&gt; Allam, who gave the party £200,000 before the election, said he would not donate again if Corbyn won. “I don’t believe I would join what amounts to a criminal action against the country by supporting any hard left trade union figure.”

&gt; John Hutton, a Labour peer and former cabinet minister, said the party would split if Corbyn was elected leader.

&gt; “The Labour party has got too much common sense to choose him as a leader because he can’t lead the Labour party,” he said. “He would immediately split the party.”

&gt; The leftward lurch of Labour is partly blamed on the reforms introduced by Ed Miliband in the wake of the Falkirk vote-rigging row. The projected figure of 140,000 new voters is based on the fact that 52,000 full members have joined since Miliband’s defeat, to push membership up to 253,566.

&gt; Assuming people sign up at the same rate, another 14,000 will have joined before the August 12 deadline to take part in the leadership contest, taking the number of new members eligible to vote to more than 66,000.

&gt;Another 17,830 people have paid £3 to become “registered supporters”, a category that was introduced by Miliband. This is set to climb above 22,000 if they continue to join at the same rate.
&gt;
&gt;Unions have also signed up 25,338 “affiliate members”, who do not have to pay a penny themselves under the new rules. Another 30,000 affiliate applications are being processed, taking the total number of new activists who can vote to about 140,000.
&gt;
&gt;Many have been recruited by the union Unite, which is affiliated to Labour but also includes members from hard left groups on its ruling executive council, which has endorsed Corbyn. All have an equal say in the leadership election.
&gt;
&gt;The Communist party of Great Britain (CPGB) chairman, Jack Conrad — whose real name is believed to be John Chamberlain — called in a podcast last Sunday for people to sign up. “What makes sense from our point of view as revolutionaries is if we’ve got a strategy as regards Labour, just as in the same way we’ve got a strategy as regards the trade unions, then what we need to be doing is encouraging people to join the Labour party to vote in the Labour party, to participate in the Labour party,” he said.
&gt;
&gt;An article in the Weekly Worker, the official CPGB paper, also urged people to join Labour to turn it into a true party of socialism under Corbyn. “The aim should not just be electing Corbyn but transforming the Labour party from a bourgeois workers’ party that serves capitalism into a workers’ party that serves the working class to the cause of socialism,” it said.
&gt;
&gt;A shadow cabinet minister said the increasing numbers of new members from the hard left “is a source of concern”.
&gt;
&gt;“There are Greens and [Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition] and all sorts of people joining,” he said.
&gt;
&gt;One worried MP said: “MPs that I have spoken to who have represented their constituencies for 20 years say 70 people turn up for a nomination meeting and 35 of them — around 50% of them — are unrecognisable and have never been to a Labour party meeting before,” the MP said. “Some who are recognisable are vociferous opponents of the Labour party from the left. In my own constituency we have had people sign up as members who are Greens, who stood as Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition candidates.”
&gt;
&gt;Neil Findlay, Corbyn’s Scottish campaign manager, has urged leftwingers opposed to austerity and nuclear arms to “put aside differences for a short period” to become a registered supporter for £3.
&gt;
&gt;A Labour source said several thousand new members had been rejected for administrative reasons, such as not being on the electoral roll, but just a handful were turned away because of their political affiliations.
&gt;
&gt;A Labour spokesman said all applications were verified against the electoral register and those not sharing the aims or values of the Labour party were denied a vote.

Tens of thousands of people are signing up to Labour because of it. If that sort of response happens just from an internal leadership election, with thousands offering to volunteer for him, how much momentum will be built up by the time of the next GE? This massive surge in support, with huge numbers of new members, should send a pretty clear message.

It doesn't seem that those 62% have no understanding of the feeling of offence that the killers experienced. In fact 78% agree with the statement that ""It is deeply offensive to me when images of the prophet are published"". 32% said that they understand the motives of those who launch attacks when Islam is insulted.

of course it matters little for the odd strike (strikes are at a historic low), but the in 1970s many in the British government, civil service and military even planned [a coup against the government](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/mar/15/comment.labour1) over the issues of striking, industrial relations and the power of the unions. Of course it never needed to come to that, and indeed much of those involved had been paranoid over loyalties of the Labour Party, completely wrongly. Nevertheless it show that when crisis emerges and class struggle reaches a high point power is totally willing to abandon any façades of democracy and liberalism in defence of it's class interests. This is totally predictable and natural. 

&gt;they wouldn't use water canon against the rioters in 2008

they didn't have the right to. nor did they even have water cannons. The Met only got their water cannons a couple of weeks ago and so far hasn't been allowed to use them.

&gt;they aren't going to declare marshall law and shoot on site just because people are protesting.

why are people so easy to forget history. We aren't at a high point of struggle at the moment so such an act would evidently galvanise protesters when the government was under little threat. But take a look back to the 1960s, in many western 'liberal democracies' the police and army were deployed and did kill unarmed protesters (i.e. in the USA, Germany, Italy, France...) - and in fact often carried out assassinations of political opponents and so on, just look at [COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO) or [Operation Gladio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio). It should be noted that these programs and operations are **always** justified on the basis of 'public security' or 'order'. Similarly the police has been waging a campaign against all sorts of peaceful political groups, their undercover agents featured in the media prominently recently. But of course those who disagree fervently with socialists, animal rights activists and environmental activists are all to happy to accept such. 

Simply put: educate yourself a bit. [Have a look at Noam Chomsky tearing Andrew Marr and new one over propaganda machine that is the mainstream media](https://youtu.be/GjENnyQupow?t=4m1s)

mate you sound like the 14 year old. Do you know any history? Were the military and police not involve in the systemic suppression and murder of blacks in America and over the anti-war mobilisations of the 1960s and early 1970s? Did similar is less extensive uses of the police and military not occur in pretty much every European 'western democracy' at that same time. Did not your equivalents then say exactly what you say? Oh but these are *things of the past* righttt

you also seem to have no conception of how fraught with history the word 'civilised' is

but yes in these cases the military and police did indeed have a purpose: defend the status quo etc. The police and the military are necessary components of any capitalist state. But ask a white liberal in the USA and they'll give your sanitised government-sponsored press release. Ask someone from Ferguson et al. who've had to experience the police and military (who are increasingly similar) and they will give you a very difference story and experience. Similarly ask some Kensington residents about the Met and you'll get a very different version than those from Tottenham. But yes between both the police etc. serve a purpose and the oppression and regulation of certain peoples and communities is necessary for the preservation of 'civil society', i.e. the status quo.

null,false,lgf92,null,null,null,"As so much of your income in London will go on rent it depends massively on your living circumstances.

If we take £60,000 as a starting point, first we deduct tax and NICs. Your take home pay will actually be just over £42,000, or £3,510 a month, minus any pension contributions or salary sacrifice you make.

Aiming to spend 50% of income on rent + bills, that limits your maximum rent limit to somewhere around £1,500 a month on a £60k salary. That could, of course, be increased if you're willing to have less disposable income. 

The easiest way to adjust your rent in London is to move around the city. You can get a nice [1-bed flat](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent/property-53709968.html) in Greenwich for that price, or [something smaller](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent/property-53708549.html) even closer to the centre, or [a bigger place half an hour from the middle of things](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent/property-50921815.html). 

That leaves you with around £1500-1700 a month in disposable income, with deductions for your transport and food. Let's say £1200 (~$2000) in ""purely"" disposable income a month. If that's enough to support the lifestyle to which you're accustomed then £60k would be enough. If you think you'd need more, then negotiate upwards.

Personally I think £60k is a salary you can live on, even in London, incredibly comfortably. It's almost double the average London salary. It's not a champagne-and-tailored-suits-every-weekend-salary but you should never be wanting for much with that much disposable income.",null,0,null,1437952242,null,0,1437952490,0,cth5efu,null,t3_3epbbs,null,t1_cth5efu,null,t3_3epbbs,null,null,null,1440102559,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

My main issue is that there is no community feeling about the place, nobody who lives here seems to give a damn about it, the amount of rubbish you see around town and in some areas in particular is just unbelievable. An unpopular viewpoint on this sub maybe but it's hard not conclude when you walk around the town centre that immigration isn't a very big part of that issue. 

Communities are disparate and not integrated with each other in any meaningful way, and there is definitely a perception that some areas of the town are essentially ghettos. 

There are some fairly nice residential areas but they are away from the town centre so an outside visitor won't see. 

There are decent jobs to be had, some very large travel firms are head courted around the airport site but most of my colleagues commute from surrounding towns and villages, an example of ""white flight"" perhaps.

Now I do have problems with changes to the repayments system, but that's not at odds with my support for the current system.

I want the wealthy and the large corporations to be taxed more, but I don't think that needs to go into reducing repayments for graduates that go on to have higher incomes.

I don't mean just for clothes or restaurants. I mean for most general expenditure. Food, entertainment, clothing, transport, it's all more expensive (in my experience) in London. Not necessarily 50% more, but a lot of things (eg; seeing a film) will be £8 for a ticket. When I was in the U.S. it was like $10? So still cheaper in the US.

The only thing cheaper I can think of is rent - but I don't know much about the NYC rental market as I said, so even that may not be as cheap. I have no idea what prices of electricity, heating and water etc. are in the U.S. though, so those may be cheaper here too. 

As you said, I can't imagine them giving you £100,000 if you're on $100,000 (hypothetically). The conversion to pounds is roughly £65,000. But as I said, I'd push for £70,000-£75,000 if possible.

Bradley Wiggins is a hugely talented rider, but climbing mountains is the closest thing he has to a weakness.

Now both the MPs and union members were within their rights not to vote for him because they had character concerns (valid ones too - did you see his cringe-worthy performance after the election, there is just no way a cold character like David M would have won against a cuddly character like Cameron).

The problem with David Miliband's supporters is that instead of saying, ""Those were the rules the election was fought under, both the MPs and union members were within their rights to vote as they saw fit"", they had a hissy fit. They blamed the unions, even though there's an equal case to be made that it was lost in the MPs college, by six MPs. And they demanded a change in the rules to suit themselves - with the following shambles in this leadership election.

Part of democracy is the losers accepting the result as valid under the rules. 

What I'm arguing is that a) the Miliband supporters behaved undemocratically in the way they sulked after the result (much like the SNP in refusing to accept their loss in the referendum with grace), b) they acted like they were entitled to win - they weren't, you have to fight for it, and if David M hadn't been such a cold unpleasant character he'd have done better amongst both the MPs and union members (Blair and John Smith won the unions easily) and c) changing the rules of an election in a fit of pique just because you've lost results in something worse...

Do you disagree with any of those points?

While this is true, it's worth pointing out that Scotland has some of the best potential for ROI in renewables anywhere in the world - especially wind and tidal power, not to mention the hydro pumped storage necessary to balance a grid with a large renewable mix. 

It's a rugged coastline with plenty of wind. Truly excellent for onshore and offshore turbines, world-class in fact. Pumped hydro needs mountains, to provide lakes at varying elevations; Scotland offers plenty. 

We've started to hit an interesting tipping point in the past year or so where renewables are coming down in initial purchase costs so steeply that they're almost economically superior for an investor to building a new fossil fuel electricity station; this trend is only likely to accelerate as the engineering gets better and cheaper. Volumes of scale, yo.

While it's no replacement for the fabulous oil wealth that the Yes campaign promised Scotland, they could still be a world leader for renewable tech with some slightly less backward policies than Westminster is currently providing. There's a lot of high-tech jobs and money at stake. An independent Scotland could make a fortune selling wind power to England and the rest of Europe, *and* selling us the large-scale pumped hydro storage necessary to balance a renewables-heavy grid (currently, we're building an undersea electricity cable to Norway to fulfil this second need) 

We lost a lot of potential for wind turbine manufacture to Europe, primarily because governments like the Netherlands were more supportive and captured that entire supply chain.

Again!  The idea that because someone disagrees with you that they must be talking nonsense, or lying.  I'm disingenuous for pointing out that up to 100 million people have died because of revolutionary communism?


&gt; The question is whether communism, as an ideology, is comparable to Nazism. 

Well, I was specifically responding to one sentence in the OP's comment.  It would get too messy to discuss Nazism as well.  Let's just accept that *any* ideology which results in tens of millions of deaths is probably to be avoided.

&gt;You have made claims without providing any evidence

Um, well - again - would youy like to provide a figure for how many people you think died under communism?  I just went to Wikipedia, which is usually a pretty good first stop for these sorts of things, but perhaps you have better data.

&gt; clearly without having the first clue about Marxist theory

Yup, same tactics the muslims use.  You don't know everything about our ideology, therefore you can't criticize us, even when our ideology causes problems for everyone else.

&gt;As soon as you provide some arguments for your position, I'll happily tell you why they're rubbish. 

I'm sure you will.  Cognitive dissonance will do that for you.

But here goes - I essentially agree with the historian I quoted in my first comment.  One of the main reasons why communism so often ends in tragedy is because it is a *utopian* ideology.  And the problem with utopian ideologies is that true-believers are often willing to cause any amount of harm to others in order to achieve their goal.  Same goes for Islam.  Same goes for many disastrous ideologies.

&gt;unsubstantiated (although I'm sure he makes an argument in his book) claims about Marxism that don't correspond to what Marx wrote.

As I said - I'm sure the founders of communism didn't intend for their ideology to cause so much misery.  It just so happens though, that *in practice* it does.  We've seen revolutionary communism destroy millions of lives time and time again - and yet its defenders *still* won't accept that it's an unworkable ideology.

Of course, you can retreat into the 'that wasn't true Communism' defense, but I don't buy it.  At the time, communist sympathizers in the West were quite happy to support states like the Soviet Union.  It's only when it becomes *obvious* to the rest of the world how horribly people suffered that the communist sympathizers back off and use the 'not true Communism' excuse.

You can also experiment on your own. The most basic part of cooking, before you learn how to cook things, what seasonings to use, which flavours go with other flavours, is to observe how different foods change consistency and colour when you cook them.


One of the most useful things I did when I started cooking (Mum started teaching me when I was seven) was notice how the food changed the longer it cooked. Putting four eggs in boiling water and removing them at staggered two minute intervals, then cutting them open was a good one. You can easily see how the two parts of the egg change with more or less cooking. Making toast, too; seeing the colour change with the length of time it stays under the grill. Also putting chopped onions in a frying pan and watching and feeling the colour and texture change as they cook is useful.



Learn how to cook very simple things like toast, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, mashed potato, before you try anything else, as there are things you need to get right with timing to get these right.

null,false,Oxshevik,null,null,null,"&gt;Again!  The idea that because someone disagrees with you that they must be talking nonsense, or lying.  I'm disingenuous for pointing out that up to 100 million people have died because of revolutionary communism?

No, you're disingenuous because you're trying to pretend this is an argument about whether or not millions died under Stalin and Mao - which nobody is disputing - when the whole discussion started because you essentially claimed that the deaths are the result of what Marx wrote, which is clearly nonsense.

&gt;Well, I was specifically responding to one sentence in the OP's comment.  It would get too messy to discuss Nazism as well.  Let's just accept that *any* ideology which results in tens of millions of deaths is probably to be avoided.

Marxism did not result in millions of deaths. That's the point of this discussion and I'm glad you've finally found your way back to it. For you to claim that Marxism results, or resulted, in millions of deaths, you have to back it up with a bit of evidence. Given you've never read Marx, it doesn't surprise me that you've so far failed to provide any.

&gt;Um, well - again - would youy like to provide a figure for how many people you think died under communism?  I just went to Wikipedia, which is usually a pretty good first stop for these sorts of things, but perhaps you have better data.

How many times do I have to tell you that I don't dispute the figures? I'm no supporter of Stalin or Mao.


&gt;Yup, same tactics the muslims use.  You don't know everything about our ideology, therefore you can't criticize us, even when our ideology causes problems for everyone else.

""The Muslims"" Jesus wept. You give yourself away here. Anyway, the problem isn't that you don't know everything about Marxism, it's that you appear to know nothing.

&gt;I'm sure you will.  Cognitive dissonance will do that for you.

The thing is, I'm a Marxist, so I'm quite familiar with what Marx wrote, and this isn't the first time I've heard people make these inane remarks. They're never ever backed up by a knowledge of Marxism though.

&gt;But here goes - I essentially agree with the historian I quoted in my first comment.  One of the main reasons why communism so often ends in tragedy is because it is a *utopian* ideology.  And the problem with utopian ideologies is that true-believers are often willing to cause any amount of harm to others in order to achieve their goal.  Same goes for Islam.  Same goes for many disastrous ideologies.

Utopian in what way? What do you think communism is? What is utopian about it? Usually, when asked this, the ""communism is a utopia"" crowd tend to refer to the idea of total equality, which isn't actually something communists advocate, so spare me that.

&gt;As I said - I'm sure the founders of communism didn't intend for their ideology to cause so much misery.  It just so happens though, that *in practice* it does.  We've seen revolutionary communism destroy millions of lives time and time again - and yet its defenders *still* won't accept that it's an unworkable ideology.

In practice it does? Where was it put into practice? Are you aware that the Soviet Union never claimed to have established communism? If you want to understand why the regimes of the Soviet Union and China killed so many, you actually have to study the history of those regimes. It's moronic to say, ""they called themselves Marxists so it must be Marxism wot done it"", which is essentially what you're saying.

There have been child companions before, like Susan (who was 15) and Adric (I can't remember what age Adric was but he wasn't *super* young. On a side note, your description of the character does sound like Adric), and I do like them but that's because they either fit with the tone of the show at those times or weren't played as children.

But the problem I have with child characters of that age is that they are just so dammed annoying. Courtney Wood(s?) from *The Caretaker* and *Kill the Moon*, for instance, is just such an annoying character, for me. Or maybe that was the writer's intended effect, then that would make this comparison redundant. 
I think it is because there isn't usually anyone if their own age to interact with. With adult companions, it would make sense that they would usually meet other adult characters and their interactions would be normal. But it wouldn't make sense for a child companion to meet child characters all the time, thus they would meet older characters and the interactions would always be the adult talks down to the super smart kid and then the kid shows how smart she/he is and it would get annoying quickly. 
That is perhaps not the most clear explanation of that point...

Also, it would make it appear as a child show, which it isn't, and would put off a lot of people from watching it. Heck, the idea is putting me off watching the show. I personally don't want to watch a program about a kid who had a magical friend who has adventures after he has done his homework. 

Finally, it would limit the writers on what they could do. I spoke about this not long ago when it was about blind characters, and the same could be said, some what, about child characters. Yes, you could have the kid exposed to countless deaths, confronted by his of the universe, and captured by maniacs, in a story but you would have to she the effect of what those events had on the kid for it to be a good story and that's probably not something you can do on a family program that is shown at 7pm on a Saturday on BBC One.
You couldn't really have the kid put in any kind of danger either because you know that in this day and age that they won't show the death of a kid on screen so we know he is always going to live. 

But that's my thinking on the matter.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; Maybe you're too young to care about things like not being able to afford a house

Are you for real? I'm not even that young. I'll never afford a house I mean this is Britain mate owning a house is a luxury that I'll never be able to afford.

&gt; but when we have 700,000 new people living here a year and only 130,000~ new houses a year you get a problem.

Build houses to meet demand. Create jobs and stimulate the economy in the process. More people, more economic activity (in fact a large part of the reason why the economy picked up again after 2012-13 was high levels of immigration. Increasing population increases baseline growth in GDP even if overall GDP per capita goes down.)

&gt; People are fed up of seeing their culture being eroded and I really can't blame them.

What do you mean by this? Specifically? Sounds like a euphemism to me. 

Cultures change. No doubt my culture is vastly different to that of my grandparents, and their grandparents. Arranged marriages for example were a hallmark of traditional British culture for a very long time up until the 18th and 19th centuries when it started to get phased out, and I don't feel we're any worse off for that.

&gt; We do not have infinite room. I don't want to see our countryside be concreted over for new houses. 

This is weak. Less than 2% of Britain is built up and although it's a densely populated country it's not like we're living in the Gaza Strip or something. This space argument has no basis in fact.

&gt; I don't want to see our countryside be concreted over for new houses. 

Who's saying that we should do that? Plenty of brownfield and undeveloped wasted land we can use for new houses. And I like the British countryside too but I also like shelter even more. 

&gt; Sorry, but it sounds like you live under a rock.

Just to deal with this that nationalism you're talking about is civic nationalism, not a return to blood and soil nationalism. Likewise politcal concerns, such as Scotland and Catalonia having vastly different political preferences, are also far more significant than some vague notion of cultural difference or language difference, or even ethnicity (which is especially daft when you're talking about people who are very very closely related in genetic terms)

Yes I'd argue that states based on ethnic groups isn't an idea that's going to last. It was always a highly debatable topic anyway - especially as since the discovery of the human genome we can actually track that in quite a specific way, so that for instance someone from Westphalia is more likely to be ethnically similar to someone from Alsace in France than someone from Leipzig, but because they don't share a language they don't feel part of the same poltical unit. 

I'm not suggesting they'll disappear overnight, but a mixture of globalisation, mass immigration, the internet and so on is undermining it. Likewise people's don't culturally come to some arrangement based on geography - I have more things in common on a cultural level with people who live in far flung regions of the world than I do with half the people in my street! People in a ultra-connected world, where spatial differences don't matter as much, where we don't live die and work in the same village we're born in and our parents were born in, aren't people who are going to strongly identify culturally with these things which people a century or two ago used to identify with. We're seeing this already in say the USA and Western Europe, we're seeing in in parts of China and Japan, we're seeing it in the middle-class areas of India and in South America, and we're only at a very early stage what are things going to be like in 50 or 100 years time when these trends have had such a long time to bed in, when it'll just be considered normal to be mixed race and being any sort of distinct ethnicity will be a weird kind of throwback?",null,0,null,1437959980,null,0,false,0,cth9lue,null,t3_3eoozx,null,t1_cth9lue,null,t1_cth92p2,null,null,null,1440104606,null,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

I'm not comfortable with the idea of presumed liability in civil cases on the driver, for a few reasons.

First, I don't see a problem with the current system of the burden of proof being on the claimant. It has always been this way and it has worked up to now. 

Second, there is an established duty of care between road users, so proving breach of duty and loss not remote from breach should not be particularly problematic for the claimant.

Third, insurance premiums will sky-rocket for everyone. This will lead to more uninsured drivers.

A better alternative system, if one is necessary, would be for no-fault damages. Instead of bringing a claim against a driver and proving their liability, the injured party makes a claim to an injury compensation scheme like the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, which is paid out of a central fund.

The situation you are describing, the reduction of party politics to pure tribalism, would, it seems to me, be far more likely to occur under any other labour leadership candidate. Over the last twenty-thirty years there has been an enormous convergence between Labour and the Conservatives; the combination of the Blairite adoption of neoliberal tenets like privatisation and a populist stance on immigration, combined with the conservatives softening on certain social issues (such as queer rights) have eroded much of the distinction between the parties, at least on the broadest levels. Corbyn is by far the most ideologically distinct of the candidates, someone who actually offers at least some promise of challenging the consensus, and disrupting the conservative narrative which Milliband so foolishly played into on the economic issues. Some element of what might appear on a surface reading to be tribalism will of course always be inevitable given the historical and cultural situation; however, personally, I feel that Labour, if anything, needs to fall back on its cultural distinctiveness, to provide a counterbalance against the middle-england pandering, upper-middle-class run, London-centric Tories. It was the situation of Labour too far inside the Westminster bubble that caused them to lose so terribly in Scotland, and it's also what caused them to lose out on so many marginal seats. Of course, the real test of an anti-tribalist opposition leader would be to throw their weight behind voting reform, perhaps following the principled example of the SNP, even though such reform might reduce their parties power in the future; though I would argue that Labour would be in a much stronger position in a proportional system.",null,0,null,1437962465,null,0,false,0,cthazzn,null,t3_3eoeqs,null,t1_cthazzn,null,t1_cth9o2x,null,null,null,1440105263,null,7,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,7,null

&gt;Transfers:

&gt;What do you think of our dealings so far?

Smart. Until the stadium is built I don't think the club can truly sustain a push for 4th without one of the others doing terribly. I also think, for the same reason, that EL is very important for us. Transfers thus far provide stability for years. 

&gt;What positions still need to be looked at?

As everyone knows. Bentaleb partner and a replacement for one or both of our underperfoming strikers. 

&gt;Do you have any realistic suggestions for those positions?

Lucky I'm not a scout I guess. 

&gt;Should we look to sell anyone else?

Soldado, Adebayor, Dembele and Chiriches. Probably the only one in the list that would surprise people is Dembele, but I don't like how injury prone he is and is seemingly unsettled due to lack of game time.

&gt;Players:

&gt;What do you think our best XI is currently?

Lloris, Rose, Vertonghen, Fazio, Walker, Bentaleb, Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli, Kane.

I only gave 10 as the gap next to Bentaleb is glaring. Dembele isn't consistent enough, Mason isn't good enough and a formation change would either bring in Townsend on the wing (4-3-3) or Pritchard behind Chadli/Kane (4-4-2 diamond) - neither of which sound particularly appetizing. 

&gt;Who do you think will improve on their last season?

Lamela has been improving exponentially. Very slow starting out but leaps and bounds in the closing few months of the last season. I can see him continuing on like this and ending the season as our largest contributor.

&gt;Do you think anyone will regress?

Kane and Rose had amazing seasons, I doubt they will keep it up.",null,0,null,1437974597,null,0,false,0,cthh1b0,null,t3_3e0bed,null,t1_cthh1b0,null,t3_3e0bed,null,null,null,1440108173,null,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1,null

http://www.lemonde.fr/tour-de-france/article/2015/07/24/le-tour-des-mysteres_4696759_1616918.html

Why that photo? Because his calves are apparently so thin that he couldn't possibly be a good enough cyclist to win the TdF.

The whole article is about how Sky is angry about being asked to publish its mechanical data, and yet according to Le Monde, how cycling ""isn't about people any more, just about technology"".

Other sections:

&gt;Il a suffi d’une accélération de Chris Froome, dans le col de la Pierre-Saint-Martin lors de la 10e étape, pour que naisse dans l’esprit du public le soupçon vertigineux, alimenté – peut-être involontairement – par les consultants de France Télévisions   : Laurent Jalabert s’est dit «  un peu mal à l’aise  » devant la facilité du Britannique quand tous ses adversaires étaient à la peine, et Cédric Vasseur a eu « l’impression que le vélo pédal [ait] tout seul ».

Basically ""At one point Froome accelerated and the French public - ""perhaps accidentally"" with the help of its TV pundits - became suspicious. Laurent Jalabert felt ""uneasy"" because the Briton had such ease climbing while his opponents were having trouble, and Cédric Vasseur had ""the impression that the bike was pedalling itself""

And then:

&gt;Il n’est visiblement pas le seul. «  Les retours qu’on a du peloton, que ce soit des coureurs ou des directeurs sportifs, c’est que tout le monde est dégoûté, que tout le monde gueule contre Sky  », confie au Monde un expert de l’antidopage qui doute de l’efficacité des contrôles des vélos tels qu’ils sont effectués par l’Union cycliste internationale (UCI)   : «  Les moteurs ne sont pas là où ils cherchent. Ce ne sont plus des batteries, mais des systèmes avec des aimants qui se rechargent avec l’énergie de la roue.  »

He's clearly not the only one, ""what we got from the peloton, from competitors and sport directors alike, is that everyone is disgusted and angry with Sky"", an antidoping expert, who has doubts in the effectiveness of the International Cyclist Union's bike checks, confides in Le Monde. ""The motors aren't where they're looking, they aren't batteries any more, but magnetised systems powered by the energy generated by the wheel"".

The rest of the article talks about the doping claims etc. etc.

I started in a fairly poor area with lots of council estate stereotypes well established and present. Eight year olds smoking. That kind of thing. I remember fights breaking out between kids, more behavioural issues. Thanks to my parents being on the governing body, I can confirm my recollections that kids got suspended and expelled fairly often. Average grades were fairly low. Provision for gifted &amp; talented started well but plummeted dramatically when they changed head teachers, the new one saying ""everyone should be treated equally and have exactly the same lessons irrespective of ability"". She didn't last long because their grades plummeted shortly after. I was taken out almost immediately when she banned the gifted and talented programs, my family citing moving as the reason. It...wasn't. The few people I kept in touch with are now working jobs and generally haven't grabbed degrees or apprenticeships or any other education beyond compulsory. 

Second primary school was a tiny village primary school where the average price of house was 3-4x higher. Class size was about half as big and average grade on a test was about double. There were no behavioural issues. In four years there was one suspension that I can recall. Of those I've kept on touch with most are becoming teachers, doctors, lawyers, civil servants. Nearly all have degrees. 

These two schools were less than ten miles apart. 

Same again with secondary schools. First was a council estate mania. Kids getting pregnant, drunk and high. Sex behind the bike sheds. Fights and expulsions common. Relatively low average grades, struggling people even in the highest tiers. Poor extracurriculars. School is now in Special Measures. 

Second one was quiet rural town. With straight As, you'd barely have been in the top third. Extracurriculars were frankly amazing. Sports, drama, music, etc. More school trips to a wider variety of places (as prices could be higher). They were buddying up with the local private school last time I caught up with them and they're amongst the best state schools in the country according to Ofsted. 

Money talks in all kinds of subtle ways. Having parents who only work two full time jobs between them and can afford to offer you endless opportunities will create a better learning environment than a household where you see your parents once a week because they're both struggling with working 90 hour weeks. 

Parents are part of education, home life affects what you can get out of education. These aren't even badly known facts. Everyone just doesn't really have comparison points to other families or an appreciation of why schools make the requests they do.

Ideally we'd be in a meritocracy where social mobility is consummate, but to deconstruct the society we currently have just..wouldn't work.

Of course better teachers want better pay and migrate to where they can get that. Of course better teachers want better working conditions and move to schools that offer well behaved classes, good subject support and fun extracurriculars. Of course better teachers want better students with a good support system, which ensures they do their homework and turn up on time and breakfasted. 

So the better teachers will nearly never be where they're ""needed"" unless they're idealistic, machoistic or overtly loyal to a school for some reason. 

Even personally, I don't work in schools in areas with social difficulties. I don't get employed by companies in those areas. The money I get paid for my work (which is in youth performing arts and music) creates a client cost beyond the majority of families in poor areas, but well within the grasp of established professional couples. I'd love to go and do Performing Arts workshops and music lessons in low income areas. But they can't afford to pay me my rates, and I can't lower my rates without downgrading to a smaller flat in a worse off area. And why should I do that?

Yet, it wasn't an especially political house, and as there was no obligation to turn up, those who turned up were (probably) doing it out of a sense of duty for the public good.

So despite it being completely undemocratic it was clearly better than the current system of stuffing the house with political appointees.

But time moves on and the system is no longer tenable, so we need to find a new way of filling the house. Election won't work because it will make the house strongly about party politics. Even if PR is used instead of FPTP, the majority of the Lords will either match the majority of the commons (in which it will be a rubber stamping process) or it will not match the majority of the commons (in which case it will obstruct as much legislation as possible, forcing all legislation to be defined as budgetary legislation to bypass the house).

So as hereditary peers are out, and electoral politics are out, sortition is the only remaining system that I can think of. 

Onto the key point of my comment: I would be very happy with filling the house with non-political experts, though I wonder if the selection process would not eventually become political.

The solution isn't to force rich kids into state schools in the name of ""ha ha your parents can't help you now, cunt!"", it's to find ways to improve *everyone's* social mobility, be they kids from the 1% or kids from below the bread line.

Make Nursery compulsory. Pay teachers more. Create ways to remove disruptive children from the classroom environment. Fund after school provision so kids can stay on and do their homework with tutors/teachers there to offer the help and guidance that well-off kids would get from their own parents. Put careers services into secondary schools so children from families with no experience of higher education or professional employment can get the information they need to make the right course choices.

&gt;Wiggins would have had no chance in this tour

Winning the Tour is about being more than just a climber. It takes endurance. Being able to climb a mountain as fast as Froome is no use if you're knackered after 2 weeks. Geraint Thomas was dropping Froome on some of the passes.

&gt;Froome should have 3 Tours and a Vuelta

And Wiggins should have 3 Tours. He was beat by three dopers in 2009 and would have blown everyone apart in 2011 if he hadn't broken his collarbone. Froome should have a Vuelta because Cobo was a doper who won by bonus seconds. Yes, if Sky was pulling for Froome from day 1, he would have won. But they didn't know he was the best for them at that time. And they had good evidence to support their view. At that time, it was thought Froome didn't have the endurance to stay on top for three weeks when they knew that Wiggins did.

&gt;Wiggins was the golden boy and Sky were unwilling to look past him.

Wiggins was their best hope for victory. You don't change horses midstream. Once he had won the Tour though, they definitely did look past him. He was pretty unceremoniously dumped by Sky.

* Don't assume that the professionals (estate agents, solicitors, bank etc) are doing their job's competently and have your interests at heart. Our first house purchase was difficult because the bank (RBS) made a total arse of our mortage, the estate agents sent the buyers pack to the wrong solicitors (who happened to be on the opposite side of the street to them ffs), the solicitors didn't chase the land registry (or whoever) for the searches, so they took ages.

* Go on http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/ and read, read read.

* Get buildings and contents and decreasing life insurance, no doubt. Be careful however with ""protection"" insurances such as sickness/redundancy cover etc. If you go to an adviser they will up-sell you stuff you don't necessarily need in order to get the commission. If you have a good job your employer may provide sufficient cover for your needs.

* You may need to pay a mortgage adviser now. They used to get paid purely on commission, but I think the law has recently changed.

* A fixed rate mortgage will allow you to budget each and every month as you know exactly what your mortgage is going to cost. It's not for everyone but they have worked well for us. I would recommend a 5 yr term as a minimum.

* Get an overpayment mortgage if you can and make overpayments, even if it's just £20 a month. It will make a big difference on the amount of interest you pay.

If you play Lucas and Allen as a double pivot, Lucas is a DM, Allen is a HM. Holding means holding on to the ball through passing and movement, even though he will be putting in the tackles and breaking up play as well. DM means Lucas will be bulldogging the ball carrier of the opponents, and intercepting passes as much as possible. In a way, the HM refers more to what our team are doing, and DM refers more to what the other team are doing.

The best players in these positions (Makelele, Busquets, Matic) blur the roles so that they do both incredibly well. You need a player this good if you want a single pivot. I think most at LFC realise that unfortunately with the players we have, we essentially have to play with a triple pivot (to include Hendo) because neither Can, nor Allen, Lucas, or other squad members are up to the job of controlling the game by themselves, at least as far as the rest of the squad is laid out.

The west has plenty of dirt on it, thats a given. I also sympathise with the view that targeting journalists in an active war zone is reprehensible. 

However, while horrible to talk in such impersonal tones, there is quite a difference between targeting 'them' in an active hot conflict, than 'us' in a normalised scenario. I don't enjoy writing that, but there is a difference within the context of the quote from this Guardian journalist.  

We are talking about a guy who witnessed - likely - evidence of a botched counter terrorism trial, and has been gagged from talking about sensitive information about abuses of the security services or information that could put other trials or investigations at risk.

Since the Guardian went close to bankrupt a few years ago, it has followed the Daily Mail down the shock jock click bait route and while the paper should be applauded for much of what it has done, it has become a parody of its former self. 

If we were to compare the Russian conflict in Chechnya and the war on terror in the UK, you can see a very distinct difference. In Russia, journalists critical of Chechnya ended up in body bags. In the UK the media has at times been gagged. Even during Putin's reign, journo's are still getting dealt with... On the flip side, Glenn Greenwald moved to Brazil and set up a truth seeking news portal.

Now... if you would have said Jill Dando. Now then there is a good example of a journalist, *reputedly* on the verge of exposing institutionalised Paedophile rings in the British political establishment, and she got shot on her doorstep.... thats one example.

NATO (read US military command) during a war zone - not really comparable at all... sorry.

Anyway, whether gagging or bagging, its all awful, but if we exaggerate and bullshit about differences, we end up in a fantasy world echo chamber.

In 1997, when Labour won, it seemed they had stolen all the popular things about the Tory policy and the Tories had no way of winning again.

Now it might look the other way.

It's far too simple to say the Tories won because people were scared of a Lab-SNP alliance. In fact, this was above all Tory campaigning stuff- vote for us or you will get Lab + SNP i.e don't vote Lib Dem or Lab.

There are many other reasons - the top ones are that the Lib Dems, by going into coalition and making several symbolic compromises esp on tuition fees, no longer looked a credible party for anti-Tory votes, and that Labour, both in its leader and its campaign, did not look very good to voters. It's been a difficult time for the world economy, and people tend to trust Conservative more on that issue.

But the biggest point is what others are saying to you- except in the loosest sense, you cannot compare politics of today to those of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Yes, you could argue that there is a vein of traditionalism about British thought,but that is not as simple as voting Tory. Traditional working-class people tended to vote Labour. One argument that Labour is less strong now concerns the erosion of the traditional working class because of social and economic changes. New Labour grabbed the centre ground and was attractive to a lot of previously non-Labour voters. Now Labour is kinda stuck between old and new approaches, neither one on its own enough to win.

An MZ from 80s is unlikely to be stolen even if you leave it with the keys and engine running, an R125 will be gone in seconds.

I see a lot of very insecure 125s all around the place. Since they are so light, no wonder they get nicked so easily.

For riding, I find CBTs reasonably priced, I don't think you will find a school doing a training less than £75 a day. If you're so skint, you might try to find a willing MotoUK member or a knowledgeable biker to take you under their wing for a day or two.

You might start watching [RoadcraftNottingham's videos on Youtube, he's a professional trainer](https://www.youtube.com/user/RoadcraftNottingham) and his videos are excellent, his advise is spot on.

Reducing the price? There's not a lot you can do apart from having an insurance, riding, not having any accidents and getting older. I pay a fraction of what you're quoted for comprehensive cover for both of my bikes.

null,false,ChrisBartWilliams,null,null,null,"People on here like to believe that it's because there has never been a genuine left wing alternative to the mainstream political parties but it's because the population has moved increasingly towards the centre and centre right. In England at least. The last overtly left wing Labour leader got decimated in a general election. The Labour Party hasn't won a general election without Tony Blair for forty one years. And even then it was with a majority of one.

The reality is that the middle class has exploded in this country and people by and large want to see things that will affect them positively. Labour effectively made a rod for its own back by appealing so convincingly to 'Mondeo Man' and the centre ground. The 'aspirational' middle class that Burnham, Cooper and Kendall keep going on about. The problem is that advocating a move towards electability to that middle class is now to make yourself open to accusations of being a Blairite. As the words ""Tony Blair"" are usually followed by the words ""war criminal"" Blairism has become anathema to the Labour Party despite its core values, messianic sense-of-destiny foreign policy aside, being pretty popular with the general public at large.
