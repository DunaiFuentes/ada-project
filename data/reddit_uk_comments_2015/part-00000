Never mind overlooking that schools like Eton and Harrow are the tiny percentage of public schools in the country in how they are, that hedge fund manager's son doesn't get anywhere near Eton unless he's really really intelligent. 

It's notoriously difficult to get a place there, probably the hardest 11+ exams in the country and an interview. Also they weed out Boys who get Bs from first year to sixth form. That's why 95% of all their GCSE grades are A/A* and 83% of all A level grades are A/A*. Of course wealth goes a long way, but when people dismiss them and attribute all their academic success to it it's ridiculous. The 45 boys a year that Eton send to Oxbridge are legitimately extremely intelligent and hard working and deserve their place there.  

I went to a top 50 independent, we had about 4000 applications a year with 150 places after examinations and then a interview with about 3 kids a year loosing their place because of low grades. Pretty much everyone in my year bar some of the drama, music and sports scholars (own talent) were legitimately very clever. I'm from a working class background, yes there were quite a few wealthy people at my school but it's greatly exaggerated by the mindset that every private school is like Eton. Most are not, most kids from my school came from your fairly average middle class family who made a lot of sacrifices to send their kids to private school.

null,false,TylerZip,lfc12,,null,"I think it's a bit harsh to say he doesn't run after the ball and is static because he's not, he picks and chooses when he makes a run and when he closes down an opponent. He doesn't always choose the right moments, but there was a perfect example of it against United when Markovic played him through. He made a great run in behind the centre back, but he doesn't make it every time, coming short instead. You see Sturridge make a run like this pretty much everytime we have the ball but Balotelli doesn't do it. Some people might see this as him being lazy, others see it as him keeping the defenders guessing as to what he's going to do. Depends on your point of view. We haven't exactly been great in an attacking sense in the majority of games he's played and so it has been hard to judge properly how often he makes runs, but I would like to see if he makes more runs in the new system we've been playing. I think then we can judge him properly, as we've clearly been creating more, and if he still can't perform or show signs of improving then the problem is definitely with him and not the team 

When tracking back he only seems to put pressure on the defender when he thinks he can actually win the ball or the other team could counter. He's not like Suarez who would chase after the defenders constantly. Again you could see this as him being lazy but personally I would rather him only chase the ball if he can actually get it. My problem with people that call him lazy for this is that Sterling does exactly the same and doesn't get criticised for it. But thats another matter.

I think this is one of those games that we decide what type of squad we are.

I want our strongest team tomorrow. Which definitely means Kane, Eriksen, Vert, Fazio, Davies, Walker, and Lloris. Beyond that, I'm not entirely sure. I'd put Chadli in that line-up and probably Lamela. However, I can see the case for Lennon. 

My prediction is a 2-1 loss. My optimistic prediction is a 2-2 draw.

He regenerates: we reincarnate, 2000-3000 yrs or more for all the lifetimes it takes to for a single soul to actually learn this planet, and somewhere up ahead, if we don't just blow the whole thing to a black cinder, lies ""all of time and space"" for us to explore.

Of course, in the end it's over, sort of . . . although, since energy cannot be created or destroyed, the universe pops itself inside out and blossoms out into another one, and on and on ad infinitum. Given the scale of such events (which can only think about in a tiny and abstract sort of way -- but reading Olaf Stapledon (sp?) helps), the whole bundle of concerns pretty much goes to pinpoint size pretty quickly.

I also think that time moves in only one direction (at least on the physical plane of our reality), so that every event is unique and once past is gone for good, or preserved for a while in memory (although from a God's eye view, which maybe becomes possible if should your soul evolve far enough, it's probably timeless and all happening at once).  But each time the same ""thing"" happens, it's new, because everything continues to change around it and within it, on every level. 

I'm not a ""you only go round once"" kind of person.  I think it all takes a whole lot longer (whatever ""it"" turns out to be) and is massively more interesting -- kind of like the Doctor's own travels.  I also assume that we have souls, of course, which is just about as subject to rational proof as the rest of my notions of all this.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"&gt; That's an impressive strawman you've built up. Nobody argues that all the world's woes would be solved if Islam went away, just as I imagine most people didn't argue that defeating Nazism during WW2 would create everlasting world peace. But of course that wasn't a good excuse to leave Nazism alone in 1939, just like it's not a good excuse to ignore Islam today. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good as they say.
&gt; 

Well to say that Islam is the only religion that is an issue is just stupid and wrong. Is islam a threat? Yes. Is it the only threat out there as far as religion is concerned? No. To ignore Islam's threat is stupid, but to then say we should ignore all other religions or dismiss them as harmless is just as retarded. Every time someone brings up violence in other religions the same response is called out ""HURR DURR IT'S NOT ISLAM!"" 

&gt;And just because Hitler used rosy, religious language to galvanise the German people doesn't mean he was a Christian extremist, that's so absurd it's almost not worth mentioning. You might as well argue that Thomas Jefferson was a religious extremist because he talked about God and a creator in the American Declaration of Independence, even though by all accounts he was as secular people got back then. You should read up on Hitler's religious views.. Most historians agree that he allied himself with Christianity when it was politically useful but in his private was a deeply secular person. As the historian Laurence Rees concluded ""Hitler's relationship in public to Christianity - indeed his relationship to religion in general - was opportunistic. There is no evidence that Hitler himself, in his personal life, ever expressed any individual belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church"".

As a history buff myself I can say that Hitler, Nazism and indeed Neo Nazism is very much Christian. The argument that Hitler wasn't religious and used religion as a way to garner more support simply doesn't hold water with many people. He was, by all accounts very religious, traditionally so, even. He justified his acts using religion and his acts were religious, they were wiping out the foreign, non christian influence in favour of Christian influence. The only documents that support that Hitler was non religious was his ""Table talk"", a document that to a lot of historians is controversial. The table talk, which was recorded ""for posterity"" also recorded Hitler as saying the Holocaust was not happening. I do not believe a lot of the table talk is that trustworthy.

&gt;And finally, I'm not really interested in talking about religious extremism that occurred 500 years ago. Christianity has grown up like most other religions and divorced itself from obnoxious piety. It's not a coincidence that Buddhists and Mormons aren't flying planes into office buildings in the 21st century.

Has it? I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. Religion hasn't ""matured"", it's just learnt how to use PR. Lets have a quick look at the clusterfuck that is Uganda. The Ugandans, with encouragement from religious leaders both in Uganda and the USA, are trying to pass a law that would see not only gay people put to death, but effectively anyone who didn't report them. This law was the result of talks, visits and campaigns from Christian pastors from the USA, some of whom have links to the US Government. Now the reason why this law hasn't passed yet isn't because ""it's a fucked up law"", no. It's because of a technicality in the constitution which is quickly being remedied. 

You know the Anti-Gay propaganda law in Russia, you know, the one being used to arrest people for holding hands, raid people's homes and even dismiss rape cases, guess who's behind that? The Russian Church.

Ireland, with the help of it's church, have basically turned pregnant women into nothing but incubators. One woman was killed after being denied an abortion for a baby that was already dead, one woman who died was kept on life support to the point she began to rot because she was pregnant at the time. They cut open women's vaginas rather than give them caesareans. Why? Because religion. No other reason.

In the USA we have laws that make having a miscarriage an arrestable offense. There's a law that require doctors to shove an ultrasound dildo up you and actively lie to you on medical matters. In one state, you have to lie to children about homosesxuality being legal. Michigan is passing a law that will allow EMTs to let people die on religious grounds. In one state, you can bully someone on religious grounds in schools and teachers can't stop it. There's states where a pharmacist can deny you your meds because their imaginary friend told them to, Louisiana is funding a science program that teaches the Loch Ness Monster exists and all of this is due to religion. There are pastors and churches calling for the death of homosexuals, people of different religions amongst others, and indeed, people doing just that and everyone just ignores it. Christianity isn't as violent as Islam because it's better, they're less violent because they don't have to be violent to get their way. If they want something or want to do something, they can do it with impunity. Christianity is in a place Islam can only dream of, they can pass bullshit, theocratic laws and get away with it. If these laws were passed through pressure from Muslims, they'd be riots. And lets not even get into people like ""Crusader for Christendom"" Anders Brevik and the like.

Even Buddhism, fucking buddhism, Mister ""I'm so fucking peaceful"" itself, is getting in on the act. In Myanmar, Buddhist mobs are raiding Muslim areas and villages and killing Muslims there. Men, Women and children are being killed by this apparently peaceful religion. 140,000 people have fled their homes because of this. Oh, and you know how Muslim countries arrest people for insulting Mohammed? People are being arrested for insulting Buddhism, as bizarre as it may seem.

But of course, all of this is OK, it's Islam exclusively that's the problem, we should actively ignore *all* other acts done in the name of other religions.

Am I being an apologist by saying this? No, I hate Islam as much as every right minded person. It is violent, it is authoritarian, but guess what? So is pretty much every single mainstream religion both currently, previously and in the future. Religion is a mental illness, a cancer that must be wiped from the world no matter what. It's like putting the guy who believes the voice of God is calling him to kill everyone in a secure unit whilst letting another guy who believes lamp posts wants him to kill everyone go free, even after committing acts of violence. We shouldn't be fighting religion with an exacto knife, we should be using a claymore and we shouldn't give a fuck about what part of the monster is the liver and what part is the spleen, it's all the same fucking monster. Lets kill it, bathe in it's blood and piss on it's fucking grave.

A lot of it was to do with Chiriches' failure to stop Young cutting in (something which he should have been warned about pre-game), but Townsend's pressing game is not close to as intense as Lamela's is and needs to be noted.

I just don't see us breaking them down and scoring unfortunately.  Possibly an Eriksen wonder-freekick, but even then Courtois is probably too good to be beaten from a dead ball easily.  If they score more than one goal, I don't see us taking any points from this one.

Their backline is very, very solid, and Azpilicueta will have the number of whoever we put out on the right, whether Townsend, Lennon or Lamela.  His positioning is too good, and our right midfield is arguably our weakest link at the moment.

Matic will shut down a lot in the middle of the park, which makes me think it might be best springing a surprise and starting Eriksen on the left of the attacking midfield band.  Give him a bit more space away from Matic, and it will allow him to come inside and overload the middle if Chadli/Lamela/Kane is doing their job properly.",null,0,null,1420080253,null,0,false,0,cnawbjm,null,t3_2qyrjp,null,t1_cnawbjm,null,t3_2qyrjp,null,null,null,1425122383,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

And way to completely ignore every other point I've made. 

&gt; We have no fucking God-given right to top 4 until we spend on top 4 quality players. 

And did I mention that we have a right to finish top 4? In case you cant comprehend, the MINIMUM goal for any manager here should be the top 4. How he does it with the budget he has been given is his job. And let's remind ourselves once more that Sir Brendan had 120 million to spend, of which he made a right hash in some terms by not signing a top quality player. Not world class, just someone who can slot in straight away and bring goals here.

&gt; Part of me almost wants BR to go so you can see just how unfeasible it is to go top 4 with no financial change

We've managed it before with a manager who knew how to win, in case you want to discount that as well......and he was under pressure, the pressure that Rodgers will never know. 

&gt; You just can't seem to understand that.

I do. What you seem to not get is that there is no guarantee of success with longevity. Arsene Wenger has not been out of the CL since I dont fucking know when. Rodgers, seeing his performace till date, will not make it every year since there are financial constraints on him according to you. So why not get someone who can actually manage with that budget then? And extract the maximum out of his players? Someone who can, you know, win things? 

Anyway, like I said before. Rodgers finishes top 4 this year, and I will never criticize him ever again.

I don't use a spray on poly, though, I brush on with sponge brushes, so that could make a difference. 

I also do two sanding passes before any stain or poly - first with 220 grit, then 600 - so the wood is already smooth to the touch, before the first poly pass.  Then I wipe them down with a cloth damp with mineral oil (to get rid of all sanding dust and dirt) before staining. 

Anyway, I can get a really nice gloss with just two passes now, and it saves me a bit of time.

Thameslink, past: a railway between Brighton and Bedford (also including Luton and Gatwick airports) but mostly associated with (wasted on?) london suburban trains pootling around a loop to Wimbledon

Thameslink, future: as above + Peterborough and the East Coast mainline, Cambridge, Guildford, most of Kent etc maximising N/S national connections across London

Past resident of (eg) Peterborough: I want a train to Gatwick, guess I have to stop and change in London, _sigh_

Past resident of (eg) Eastbourne: I have a business meeting in Bedford, guess I have to hack across the Tube, _sigh_

Future: I'll just get a direct train there without everything having to involve London

current work tl;dr - the tracks are all tangled up around London Bridge, they're tidying it up so ""through"" services are all on one side and stopping/commuter London services are all on the other side, and the key junctions/crossings are grade-separated, so the trains don't get in each other's way.

You could have just referred to Chipping Norton as a small town in the west of England and gotten the same message across.

And (though I am not 100% sure on this), I believe every public school (government school) student in the UK must study ancient Greek and Roman history, and learn modern Greek and Latin. Combined with a strong Shakespearean theatre tradition, it's no wonder UK shows can be sharp and highbrow. I can't remember the last time Charlemagne or the Byzantine Empire or Hammurabi's Code was referenced on a US show. References to classical history are very rare on a US show and usually done for comedic effect (a scene set in ancient Rome might have fake-Latin names or play up Caligula)

On Top Gear they were testing a UK-built supercar, the Ascari A10. When the Stig was doing his power lap, Jeremy called the A10 ""Brunellian Fury"", referring to Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the famous Victorian-era engineer. But I wouldn't know this until I looked up who the heck Isambard Kingdom Brunel was. Honestly I misread it as Islam Kingdom Brun*ei* and thought it was another name the tiny oil rich country near Malaysia (Oh, I'm sorry, *Borneo*), with the absolute monarch who buys supercars to let them rot in the jungle. 

This can be extended to British media in general, including radio and literature. George Orwell, in ""Down and Out in Paris and London"", recalls what a Roman emperor, Marcus Cato, said about slavery--""A slave should either be working or asleep"". It turns out there were *two* Marcus Catos, and it took me some serious Googling to figure out that Orwell was quoting Cato the Elder. We only studied Caesar in my schooling, and the few Roman emperors known in North America are Augustus (was emperor when Jesus was born), Nero (emperor during the Great Fire of Rome), Marcus Aurelius (from the movie Gladiator), and Caligula (from the movie Caligula, also a metaphor for hedonism and debauchery)",null,0,null,1420093441,null,0,1420106646,0,cnb0ogr,null,t3_2qzi80,null,t1_cnb0ogr,null,t1_cnb0hmh,null,null,null,1425120328,null,10,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,10,null

&gt;

&gt;The __Cat Stane__, or __Catstane__, is an inscribed standing stone near [Kirkliston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkliston), on the outskirts of [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh), in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). It bears a fragmentary inscription dating to the fifth or sixth centuries and was formerly part of a funerary complex consisting of the stone itself, a [cairn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairn) and a series of [cist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cist) burials. 

&gt;The stone's [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) inscription is interpreted as a dedication to a deceased woman whose remains were interred near the stone. Dates have been ascribed to the stone and its inscription by considering the script used and the results of several excavations conducted in modern times.

&gt;The stone appears to have been erected in the [Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age) while the inscription was added in the fifth or sixth centuries AD. During the latter period the area around modern Edinburgh was controlled by the nation known as either [The Votadini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votadini) or [The Gododdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gododdin).

He's done very well for a 36 year old striker who many thought was just a leadership signing, but I think Remy would've put away all the chances Drogba has so far and probably a few more. It's not just his pace too you notice his decline. His shot is still strong, but it's clearly lost quite a bit of power and accuracy behind it. Poor Remy has done his role perfectly when he's got his few chances and the one he did start, he scored early but got injured celebrating. Really don't know what more he could be doing to get the occasional nod over Drogba. I guess I can't criticize Jose too much though until it ends up hurting us though.

Where have you got that from? That's the kind of thing Britons would say are learnt in a private school (which we confusingly call public schools). A little bit of Roman history might be learnt, mostly in relation to their invasion of England and influence on early English culture, but I don't recall I or any of my siblings being taught any Greek history. Languages taught in schools are more along the lines of French, German, Spanish, and increasingly some form of Chinese.

Isambard Kingdom Brunel is a very famous figure in the UK. Some people actually do learn about him at school, and if you asked most people to name an engineer, he's the *only* one they could come up with. They're also not likely to have an in depth knowledge of Charlemagne, the Byzantine Empire or Hammurani's code; I've never even heard of that last one.

Besides *Top Gear*, which has the only reference I actually would expect most people to get, the only work you've mentioned is *Down and Out in Paris and London*, which is not something I'd have expected many people to read. You've found a highbrow reference in a relatively highbrow book. However, is it possible Orwell knew he was using a relatively obscure reference? Is knowing the man important, or is the quote and the fact that he was a Roman Emperor sufficient to understand Orwell's point?

I'm thinking of the kind of person who has good A Levels and possibly an undergraduate degree (though obviously not in literature) who reads something like one book a month and has titles like *Pride and Prejudice*, *Midnight's Children* and *Dubliners* under their belt, as well as Orwell's own *1984*.

I've not yet been able to pick a favourite overall, but I have favourites from each season:

**The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances** - Because it genuinely creeped me out and because it's when Nine is the most fun.  
**New Earth** - Because I love a little shop.   
**Blink** - Surely this needs no explanation.  
**Midnight/Turn Left** - I have to take these as one episode because of the Doctor-lite/Donna-lite nature of them. And because I feel like their messages really tie in with each other: the idea of the Doctor powerless in Midnight and Earth lost without him in Turn Left. The oppressive amount of fear in those episodes destroyed me.

null,false,PROFESSOR_CORGI_BUTT,irish,null,null,"TL;DR: White, upper middle class men have an inbuilt advantage in the job market (in America, Canada and the UK) unrelated to ability. This has been studied and shown since the mid 1980s,* and is compounded by the belief that the dominance of white, middle class men in the upper tiers of most career paths is solely due to merit. 

Being from the same social background and sharing a gender with the people hiring you, or the section of society that dominates high status, high pay jobs carries an inbuilt advantage in the hiring process. There have been many sociological studies on the disadvantages of being an outgroup in the job market, right from the name and address on your CV to your voice and appearance. An applicant who looks and sounds like John Humphries against an equally qualified applicant who doesn't is more like to be hired. It isn't down to explicit racism or sexism, either- just a set of societal assumptions that favours those already in an advantageous position, e.g. 'This guy is just like the guy we already have and like!' 

Do you really thinking that the upper strata on most career paths is dominated by white, middle class men because they are inherently more talented than non white males and women, or that non white males and women are hugely less ambitious? 

Initiatives like Creative Access are addressing an existing unfair advantage in favour of upper middle class white men in the hiring process within the anglosphere. An advantage exacerbated by the widespread belief that there is no advantage, and that the dominance of middle class white men in the highest levels of many careers is purely merit based, and nothing to do with assumptions on the part of recruiters that applicants who look and sound like the existing employee base are a better fit for their organisation (or that the applicant's Dad is a great mate so their son will fit right in). 

*I'm not near my computer to link to the research papers right now. 

I'm from Northern Ireland, and as I was growing up I got to see first hand how societal assumptions that 'Catholic' and 'Protestants' were 'naturally' better at certain things can distort the job market. Thankfully due to government legislation it's nothing nearly so bad, but I'm sure there's a lot of 'the person not of our cultural group just wouldn't be as good to work with as the person from inside our cultural group' still happening.

He is impressive going forward, but think about other attacking fullbacks: Alves, Jordi Alba, Marcelo, Clichy, Piszczek - they work so well because they have a solid defence behind them to leave and go marauding forward. We're not quite there as a defensive whole. Manquillo looks good in that regard, but has the opposite problem of not being aggressive or clinical attack-wise. I supoose this can only be good in the long run thouh if they get extended match time together, and they can play off each others strengths.

I remember watching [Gary Neville's analysis](http://youtu.be/dt702DSqn04?t=5m08s) on Migs. He basically reckons that Mignolet is often crouching too low when awaiting a shot which reduces his reach. 

In this case, it seems that being so low makes him unbalanced and the dive almost looks like a fall. If it was a shot that was a bit higher, it seems unlikely that it would have been saved.

Here's a quick summary of the options I have, from my perspective:

* Lib Dems: As someone who entered university last year, I previously would have voted for them, almost entirely due to their policy to scrap tuition fees. The first thing they did, the moment they got an ounce of power, was to triple tuition fees. I swore I would never vote for them again.
* Labour: apparently represent the working class, and a lot of people up north (where my uni is) are Labour voters. Blindly followed America into a pointless invasion, the only goal of which being to turn a failed state into a *slightly different* failed state, spending hundreds of lives in the process.
* Conservative: least aligned with my political views, currently taking the turn of driving the country into the ground. Trying to silently destroy the NHS; one of my favourite things about this country is that no matter what happens, the NHS is always around to save your life. Banned female ejaculation. Currently trying to legalise fox-hunting. And a million other things that makes me not want to vote for them.
* Third parties: I would vote for a third party, but all I've ever been told is ""a vote for a third party is the same as not voting, and not voting means you hate the country"". The vast majority are racists, single-issue parties on issues I don't care about, or joke parties. The only party I like (Pirate Party UK) I can't vote for because they're not running in my area.

- Meanwhile, the honours list for Northern Ireland included an MBE for a Ballymena councillor who stated that hurricane Katrina was God’s revenge for an annual gay event called the Southern Decadence festival.

On the 2005 disaster which killed 1,300 people and left tens of thousands homeless, Democratic Unionist councillor Maurice Mills said: “The media failed to report that the hurricane occurred just two days prior to the annual homosexual event called the Southern Decadence festival which the previous year had attracted an estimated 125,000 people,” said Mills.

“Surely this is a warning to nations where such wickedness is increasingly promoted and practised.”

Mills also blamed the spread of Aids in Africa on gay people. “This abominable and filthy practice of sodomy has resulted in the great continent of Africa being riddled with Aids,” he said.

The gay rights organisation the Rainbow Project demanded that his party reject Mills’s comments but the DUP declined to do so.

null,false,Womb_Raider_69,king,,null,"&gt; What do you believe is the strongest starting 11?
LLoris
Walker Dier Vertonghen Davies
Capoue Bentaleb
Lennon Eriksen Chadli
HurriKane
I have chosen Lloris for the obvious reasons as well as Vertonghen Eriksen and Kane.
Walker has just came back from injury and is already outperforming Naughton, Dier and Chiriches in the RB role, but i do believe Dier is the stronger of the CBs when compared to Fazio and Chiriches as i think they both seem to make way too many mistakes on a regular basis despite Fazios high rating. the choice between Danny Rose and Ben Davies was a very hard one as i think both have has a good season so far.
As the CMs go this was one of the hardest positions to chose from as no one has been above average on a regular basis there thats why i chose to leave out players such as Dembele and Mason, i would like too see Paulinho get more of a change but its clear Pochettino isnt too keen on him, so i doubt we will be seeing that anytime soon.
I have  decided to pick Lennon(RM) and Chadli(LM) on the wide flanks instead of players such as Lamela and Townsend due to Chadli having very good goalscoring form this season so far scoring 7 goals and assisting 3 in the premier league alone. while lennon hasnt been that inpresive the the few games he plays i think he is a key player for our attacks due to him being a very wide player that keeps width, this combined with his pace and crossing ability trumps Lamela and Townsend on the right so fat this season. Lamela has been good but very inconsistent while Townsend has been utter Sh*te.

&gt; What player(s) have impressed you most this season, why?
I as many other spurs fan would have to go Kane, he has quickly transformed from a  striker that wasn't starting 11 quality to a striker who is a potential for the England national team and probably one of the futures of the national team.

&gt; What player(s) have failed to impress this season, why?
Townsend, after his fantastic start to last season, he unfortunately picked up a long tern injury and seems to have never been the same since.

&gt; What position on the pitch is the club STRONGEST in?
The attacking midfielders, Erisken, Lamela and Chadli has played very good together and they seem to have gelled very well, i would like to see lennon bet more of a change thou.

&gt; What position on the pitch is the club WEAKEST in?
Central/Defensive Midfield, no one can play consistently enough there, i think letting Sandro go was a terrible move from Pochettino
ST, only one striker that can score goals on a regular basis, Ade and Soldado both need to go.

&gt; What transfers OUT need to happen next summer?
BAE, Adebayor, Soldado, Capoue, Kaboul, Naughton.

&gt; What transfers IN need to happen next summer?
either Lacazette, Berahino or Icardi, also a player we've been after for a while in Schneiderlin or maybe Cabaye if Schneiderlin isnt possible.

What they need in a nutshell: The spine of a team

Window shopping: I looked at Reds boss Brendan Rodgers' Anfield transfer record before Christmas. It is poor but, if he gets the right backing and gets the right men this time round, then his side can still make the top four.

Rodgers is all right in midfield but he needs a goalkeeper, a centre-half and a centre-forward. Up front, Wilfried Bony would be my choice - he has got power, he works hard and is mobile.

Davies has impressed me the most, he's better than I thought. Kane has been our best player so far though

Lamela has failed to impress me. I thought he'd knuckle down this season and be a team player but he plays for himself  

We're probably strongest in midfield but it doesn't feel that way because our best midfielders aren't getting games.  

We're weakest up front, which is a shame because that's usually our strongest area. We need to find a way to play to Soldado's strengths because it'd be a shame to lose him because of impatience.  

I don't know about specific players but I think we need fewer midfielders. I don't want to see Lamela or Paulinho go but they're not really playing. Even Mason and Bentaleb are getting ahead of them in the pecking order. I wouldn't be sad if Townsend left but the guy has potential, he just needs a manager who'll work with him to make him more productive.  Adebayour is the only one who really needs to go.

I think we probably need another striker. I don't like playing one up front and I'd like to see Soldado, Kane and one more.

I'm a bit frustrated with Poch. Some of his decisions are baffling. I'm all for giving youth a chance but like Sherwood it's over the top. You can't treat young players, even the good ones, like you would an experienced player. As tempting as it is, you have to tread carefully but Poch has been going all in.

I don't think we've been that good this season but we showed improvement at the end of autumn. Over Christmas we picked up some good points but performances were worse. If we continue to improve we've got a shot at top 4 but I don't think our players are good enough. It's going to be tight so it's anywhere from 4th-6th

Best chance of success this season is the league cup. It'll be a tough final but we've got a good chance. Can't see us getting to any other finals this year. Out of all cups by April.  

Top 4 will be Chelsea, Man City, Man Utd. 4th place will probably be Arsenal but it's really open this year. I think West Ham and Southampton will run out of steam leaving us and Arsenal to fight it out.

British people get British references. 

&gt; George Orwell, in ""Down and Out in Paris and London"", recalls what a Roman emperor, Marcus Cato, said about slavery

He went to Eton - not a typical state school, the most prestigious school in the country.
&gt;.We only studied Caesar in my schooling, and the few Roman emperors known in North America are Augustus (was emperor when Jesus was born), Nero (emperor during the Great Fire of Rome), Marcus Aurelius (from the movie Gladiator), and Caligula (from the movie Caligula, also a metaphor for hedonism and debauchery)

That's ~~probably~~ definitely more than the average Brit knows about ancient Rome.

The most popular British TV shows are X Factor, which we gave to you as a lovely gift, Strictly Come Dancing - which we also gave to you as Dancing With The Stars, and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here - I don't think you have that - a load of 'celebrities' in need of publicity get taken to a campsite in the Australian bush, and eat insects and kangaroo genitalia for the amusement of the public.

The PRC claims that there is only one China and will not hold diplomatic relations with any state that recognises the ROC as a state.

In this day and age though it doesn't make much sense to decide the future of millions of people and a major world economy on the basis of a century old treaty signed by people who are no longer alive. If the UK really wanted to make a case for HK remaining a BOT then it should have held a referendum asking the population what they wanted, overseen by an impartial observer. If a substantial majority were against the handover, that could have been presented to the international community as the population of Hong Kong expressing their will and the PRC acting as the imperialist aggressors.

Been looking around to see who else we could go for, all the good names I can think of are either on loan or just moved clubs. Really frustrating.

Can only really see the ""budget"" options at the moment. If we do go down the ""sign another striker"" route, Lasse Vibe is capable on the wing as well as up front, a bit like good Andi, actually. Fabian Schar might be an option to replace Vlaar long term if he goes. Christensen is being talked up as a potential Delph replacement (though I'd like to see them together, tbh) ... none of the three would cost more than 3-4m I reckon. If either Delph or Vlaar goes, that money could feasibly get in at least two of those guys, assuming they were interested.

Honestly, I just want to see us sign an attacker. Anyone who *might* bridge that gap between defence and attack and I'll be excited.

Probably because of your attitude. You really can't buy any property worth investing in for £80k -- that's a fact, so there's no point getting sarcastic about it. If you can't invest in an area with strong house-price appreciation, then invest in the stock market.

&gt; I literally have nothing.

Ever heard of 'don't expect something for nothing'? Put the money you have in a New ISA, focusing on low-fee stock-market index trackers. Until you have more, worthwhile property investment is a pipe dream.

I can drive it in 2:45, leave whatever time I want all for around £50 in diesel.

We normally don't do well outside of a regional level but you know what, my team deserves me because I was born in Trinidad and Tobago.

Every time they step out, depending on who they put I'll shout for them.
Because they represent me (albeit poorly, really poorly at times)
But to me being a football fan isnt always about glory. Its about being able to celebrate that one time when your side wins (or in TT's case draws) against all odds.

I started supporting city when the only sides that existed to my country were manUre, Assenal, and Liverpool.
There was no money, no possible chance at glory and a lot of shit talk from my friends who said that city will NEVER win anything in my lifetime. Did I hop squad, no!
I stuck with my side and fate led us to glory.

Being a city fan has taught me that no one man makes the side and that people may take you for a joke at one point but if you persevere then you'll get your last laugh.

If you wanna hop ship or condemn football because of this one setback, then do so.
If you wanna be angry about this situation but rally around your side so that when they lift a cup you could say that you never lost fate that'll be even better 

I pick option 2.

So many of you guys are so upset about a perceived disrespect that you'll are willing to throw away a great thing.
That's not fandom in my book.

Can: My homie! This package of german engineering is unbelievbly cal;m in defence. Toure: Still a little rigid but he gets the job done. Sakho: Another impressive display of defensive work coupled with some sly passing. 

Hendo: Easily one of the best players on the pitch. Hendo is definitely the new engine of this team - he thrives to play his best, even out of position. Gerrard: Solid 2 penalties, needs a little work on the long range passing (he should accomadate for the wet pitch, the second/third long balls were much more accurate than the first). Lucas: Great defensive work and good interplay with the centre halves. Moreno: Getting better with every passing game. His attacking and defensive work rate are exemplary - a good example is when Sakho comes to the by-line to stop the winger and Moreno cuts into the box to defend in his position. He's able to make up for his flaws and that shows both experience and confidence. 

Coutinho: In a seriously good run of form. His dribbling and passing are inspired and hopefully he can keep this up. Another element of his game has been the constant pressing which really puts Leicester's bulky defenders under pressure. Sterling: Also getting better in the #9 role with each passing game. Great dribbling and pressing. Lallana: Super impressive - deserves a goal today.

I have yet to see Martinez actively do anything to improve our form; hell, it's been a year since we came from behind to win a game. This is further evidence to support my theory that Martinez relies too much on the confidence of the squad and is pretty inept at changing the direction of a game once it goes against him. You've got to question whether we'd be doing any worse if we had no manager at all.

However, I do still believe we should see this season out with Martinez. But with the very real idea of a relegation battle looming, questions have to be asked of the manager.

If you can get a better return on your diversified stock investment than you can on the property, then it makes sense to rent. Although you will not gain ownership of the property in 25 years' time, the return on the money which would have been tied-up paying for it would have produced a greater return than the value of the property.

This might not ring true in areas which have experienced heady levels of appreciation, but as we've already established, you cannot afford a property there anyway.

Stock investing also offers you freedom, and the ability to change track and to move abroad with ease. If you lose your job and you have a huge mortgage, you could easily lose your house -- if you've been investing in stocks, you can draw upon that wealth almost immediately.

That's theme of the day, I guess. I was disappointed in our effort, disappointed in how quiet the crowd was, disappointed to give up another easy counterattacking goal, disappointed not to get anything but a point from a team in the relegation scrap that sacked their manager this week.

I don't think anyone on our side played particularly well, or with any sense of urgency. Amalfitano and Sakho played okay in spurts. I suppose Collins was solid all day.

Our lone tactic today was ""swing it into the box"".... not a good tactic when Carroll is invisible, as he was today.

We got one, didn't deserve any more from it than that. I said a couple weeks ago that my biggest fear wasn't that we'd lose two straight at the end of December, it was that we'd lose two straight then not be able to recover immediately.

...I guess my fears were well warranted. We were shit today. We needed this three points after not getting anything from the last two. European qualification is slipping through our fingers now. Now I have to wait 9 days to see if we can turn this around.

null,false,SuffragettePizza,null,null,null,"I don't think British TV shows are of a higher class than American ones, just that only the good ones really manage to get over the pond so it gives you a skewed perception. For example, you've probably heard of shows like Spaced, QI, Broadchurch, Black Books, Black Mirror, Father Ted and The IT Crowd but you're much less likely to have heard of shows like Keith Lemon, Mrs Brown's Boys (Which is terrible, but was the 2nd most watched TV show this Christmas, only beaten by the annual Queen's Speech!), Hollyoaks, Made In Chelsea, The Only Way is Essex etc. which are all very popular but considered to be trashy/generally rubbish. I'll admit we have produced some amazing TV shows but so has America - The Good Wife, The Wire, The Sopranos, Friends, True Detective, Game of Thrones, just to name a few are all incredible TV shows that have been highly acclaimed.

Coleman: got some decent looks in the first half, we were hitting them hard on the right, and then what? Fucking nothing.

Baines: decent in his Lahm role I thought. Regular Bayern Munich we are. Damn near had a beautiful assist. Terrible at left back though. 

Besic: probably would've been sent off. Not his best performance, even in the first half. Looked like he cared though, unlike some people.

Naismith: another one who actually cared. Got beat to shit and still kept at it. 

Barkley: another shit game from him. Should've easily slotted it home that one time. Invisible in the first half.

Kone: took over for Barkley on being invisible at the half.

Mirallas: another shit part of a terrible first-half attack. Utterly awful first half for the whole team.

Lukaku: did pretty well, probably should've scored but he was getting involved.

* Gerrard shouldn't see the field until we lose without him. He offers nothing, absolutely nothing in shielding the back, and lately to be honest he doesn't do much in the attack.

It sucks he isn't what he used to be, but the team looks so so so so much better with Hendo in the middle and Gerrard on the bench.

* I pray Lallana isn't out for any time at all, he's been great and the team just fell apart once he came off.

Manquillo out, Gerrard in and Henderson out wide just didn't work. He left Can open to attacks too often because it's just not a natural position for him. Might work when you have him in a free-er role where he can come inside or stay further forward but he is completely wasted as a wingback.


Lallana injury is a blow - he, Coutinho and Sterling seemed to be striking up a serious partnership. If it were me, I'd have brought Markovic on instead of Borini and kept Sterling up top. 


Lucas for Markovic was odd, reverting back to the old Hendo-Gerrard holding mid when Lucas has arguably been our best player since he's been brought in. Left big big gaps which Leicester exploited by filling the space around Gerrard. The amount of free kicks they got in that area was very frustrating.


Can must have had word from Rodgers to push up because he was essentially a central mid for the last 10/15 minutes. This left us with a back two when Moreno came off and Can went forward with Gerrard in front.. That was never going to work and it didn't. 

Borini doesn't move like Sterling when they play that front man position which you could see resulted in a lot of plays stuttering and having to be reset because he was demanding the ball rather than making intelligent runs. Then when he got it he missed, but on the whole was a bit unlucky. Lambert didn't have enough time to really make an impact so no judgement on him but the stuff he did was generally good.


Easy to say why didn't we just line up like we did against Swansea? I'd have subbed Manquillo and Markovic on for Gerrard and Lallana and maintained shape. There were a lot of tactical switches during the course of that match and they didn't really work out for us. Moreno was found out a few times out of position etc. but I think he needs time to adapt.

Players who last season seemed incredible as they fearlessly took on possession in tight areas before switching it out to thunderous running and verve whilst this behemoth natural goalscorer up top ate goalkeepers for breakfast.

Now those players seem ponderous, with control and touch having deserted them, the thunderous runners seem tired or disinterested and that natural goalscorer wants to be Dennis Bergkamp and is not deterred by being cursed with the touch of Mikael Madar.

Worst of all are the memories of a manager who seemed to bring something new every week. Who pulled down the pants of every top club at some stage or another last season with inventive changes, and a real, club lifting bright spot after years of dour entitlement from you-know-who.

There are mitigating circumstances, there always are, but it doesn't stop the league table being reality.

Mane! I screamed at my monitor for him to cross, and was sure the ball was going to be no where near the goal. How wrong I was! I really like him as a second striker behind Pelle. His pace isn’t wasted there, whereas on the wings, he can beat them to the corner flag, but then does fuck all with the ball. 

Gardos did a brilliant job at centreback imo. Yeah he had that questionable fould (lucky to get away with a yellow), but he was able to handle everything Arsenal threw his way.

Bertrand with Tadic was beautiful to watch, the number of chances they created down that left hand side was astounding.

Wanyama was an absolute bully in midfield, just shoving players off the ball like they’re little school boys!

JWP, great job moving into Mane’s position after Mane had to come off with that injury. He was in some great positions, though not a clinical finisher, I think that will come with time. He’s proving to be really versatile.

One thing I’m still bothered by with this team is the finishing. So many chances, but we never seem to capitalize. JWP 3 chances to put the game out of reach, and Pelle with a sitter, hit it straight at Debuchy’s head. If you look at the games we lost to the better teams, we had more shots, and shots on target for the most part, but the other teams (Chelsea, Man Utd, Arsenal @ Emirates) capitalized on their chances. Doesn’t help if you play like shit, but I think the problem still persists, except now we create more chances. This game could have easily been 5-0.

On another note, my new favorite word is shambolic :)

I'll start by saying it did seem like we were playing slightly better than we have been at the beginning. 

Hull deserved to win, I think. 

Our defence (what defence) was borderline non-existent most times. As a defender it was embarrassing to watch.

Barry today was awful. I can think of only one occasion where he was useful and it was near the end of the game when he blocked a shot with his back. He's fine for getting stuck into a challenge as long as there's no running involved. He is either too old now or just fucking lazy because he doesn't run unless he needs to, and we all saw with that second goal that sometimes he won't do fuck all then either. I'm torn whether or not he can't do it any more or just won't do it. Or both. We'd have been much better keeping Besic on and taking Barry off. 

I think Besic was good today. He has pace and gets stuck into everything. You can see the effort he puts into playing.

Naismith today was 10 out of 10 for drive. He was everywhere. He wants it and proves it by putting in the maximum effort until the very end. 

Jags was good. He seems to be the most consistent player we have atm and he's reliable.  

I think first half Baines wasn't great. When Oviedo came on and Baines moved into midfield, he was so much better. He played some really good balls and got stuck in.

I imagine Robles will get some stick today but I actually thought he did alright. It's hard to be decent when it seems like your defence is playing for the other side with their incompetence. 

Kone was nothing special today, although he didn't get the ball often when he did he just seemed to keep it too long and eventually lose it. He could have played the ball earlier almost every time.

Barkley was alright too, although it baffled me how someone who can fight through 3 or 4 players can go down as easily as he does.

For me, the best player we had on the pitch today was hands down Coleman. Was a bit quieter at the start but the second half he was brilliant. He seemed to be both our attack and our defence. He made some excellent attacks, opting to go slightly central rather than up the wings I noticed. His attacks didn't seem to compromise his defending though because he was able to get back too. 

Other positives include less static passing, less passing back to the keeper and a lot more movement I think. 

Overall though, not good enough in my opinion.",null,0,null,1420133497,null,0,false,0,cnba8r5,null,t3_2r0kzm,null,t1_cnba8r5,null,t3_2r0kzm,null,null,null,1425115785,null,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3,null

&gt;If you receive, or are granted the title of Duke of Whatchamacallitshire, what does it actually mean for you

* Congratulations!
* No, seriously, congratulations. There's not been a non-Royal hereditary peer made since 1984 (which was exceptional), and there's not been a non-Royal duke made since 1874 (the astonishingly-rich Dukes of Westminster).
* Your name changes. If you used to be ""Bob Andrew Smith"", you're now ""The Duke of Whatchamacallitshire"", in full legal terms ""His Grace Bob Andrew, The Duke of Whatchamacallitshire"". You're no longer ""Smith"" anything. Good luck with the banks *etc.*. Note you might be ""Bob Whatchamacallitshire"" in some rarer situations, like semi-formal and less formal titles as used inside the military. (Prince Harry of Wales is ""Harry Wales"" when serving, for instance.) Lots of people will be confused.
* If you're straight, male and married, your spouse is now the Duchess (but only because she's married to you). If you're not straight, male, or married, this doesn't apply.
* Your non-bastard children get special titles (or get to use subsidiary titles if you have them).
* When you die, your first born non-bastard son or (if you're really insistent when the draft the Letters Patent and you convince them to overturn tradition in the name of sanity) your first born non-bastard child will be the Duke (or Duchess) when you die.
* You'll generally get very preferential treatment at the shockingly-rare occasions anyone gives a damn. :-)
* You have to go and have custom made your ducal robes and coronet for the [State Opening of Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament) which will cost you about GB£30k and only be useful to you when HMTQ dies.
* That's about it.

&gt; and for the good people of Whatchamacallitshire?

Nothing. We don't do Duchies, just Dukedoms. (Lancaster is owned by HMTQ and Cornwall by The Prince of Wales. No-one else gets them.)

&gt; Do you get a stipend from the State,

No. Being a Duke is pretty expensive, actually.

&gt; or first choice of seats at formal dinners,

No (at formal dinners, seats are assigned; you'll get the most prominent place there, assuming there aren't any people ahead of you in the [Order of Precedence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_precedence_in_England_and_Wales) – and note that that changes depending on whether you're in England &amp; Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, or a Commonwealth Realm.

&gt; or maybe the right to drop by the Queen and say hi every now and then

This theoretically exists, and you'd certainly get to see them quite often given the things to which you'd be invited, but no.

The worse players are supposed to get coached in game by the more experienced players and helped as long as they maintain a line of communication at any point and that is key. You refused to use your microphone, refused to listen and I assume this is only because you believe you didn't have to try in the IHL or that you were above or at the average skill level? I'm not actually sure, but we have people below 1000 IHL MMR that have not been banned because they maintain a line of communication, talk to their team and they don't simply feed and stay silent. Without naming names, we also have 3-4 2k rated players that play here and yes, the games with them in are harder but they talk to their team, ask what they don't know and listen.

This IHL is not just for you, it is for everyone, you can't just show up and guarantee the loss of the game for your team with apparently lack of willingness to be a part of your team wholly. 

We want to create a positive environment for improving whilst also maintaining a reasonable skill level, to put it frankly being positive and achieving a skill level where you can listen and follow instructions or even climb above the 3k mark is not an insurmountable task, it's probably one most people would consider easy. If you don't feel like you don't have the time well I'm sorry, this is a competitive IHL where the standard of play is important and that's the stance I'm taking and it's a stance that has been justified to me from direct feedback from large portions of the community that regularly plays IHL, keeping it alive and going, the players that we want to reward.",null,0,null,1420134353,null,0,false,0,cnbamgs,null,t3_2qsk8u,null,t1_cnbamgs,null,t1_cnb6b2x,null,null,null,1425115609,null,3,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,3,null

Obviously, this is just my very subjective experience, but from where I sit, it's been an increasing trend.

With the cost of education rising so fast and a degree no longer guaranteeing any kind of employment, it seems like would be students are seriously considering that time spent networking and developing skills on the job, may be a better use of their time.

Back four + Guzan looks solid defensively, Aly is crap going forward though, every time he got the ball he froze.
Okore was my MOTM as hecompletely shut out Bolasie in the second half.
Sanchez again is the most composed player on the pitch glad he is playing like he does for Colombia.


Also, for the short time they came on I thought Grealish and Cole (On for 5 minutes but played more attacking balls than the rest of the midfield) played well. Jack better cut out the diving though, we don't need to see that.



Right, now for the bad,

Andi ran a lot but I only remember him touching the ball about three times in the whole game. Gabi is useless at playing with his back to goal and only ran onto the ball a couple of times in the game. Benteke was frustrated from the time Vlaar went off till the end of the game. 


Just like the Sunderland game though, until Grealish came on, no one looks like they want to take on the fullbacks or at try to get the ball past them.


This season is a crock of shite at the moment and our only saving grace might be that there are 3 teams worse than us.

What if we played today's Liverpool team against Swansea? The main thing we had against Swansea was the energy of the midfielders. That's where we won the game. Lucas was the one with defensive responsibilities. He is always better when he doesn't have to share these responsibilities with Gerrard. That sharing of defensive duties is causing confusion - who goes where and marks who? The first goal (against Swansea) was direct result of Henderson's energy. We won't score goals like that with Gerrard in the team - he isn't pressing the midfielders and he isn't pushing forward. We looked shaky in the second half until we got that third goal. Who knows what would've happened, if Moreno hadn't scored that first one.

Leicester played with midfield 5 today - it was clear that they want to beat us in the midfield. We play with 3 CBs and that means we had to sacrifice one of the midfielders (or attackers, if you like). But Gerrard hardly makes up for that, does he? In that formation he has to. If he go forward with this formation, there is no space for Gerrard. Play him in attacking midfield in similar formation what we played at Leicester or don't play him at all.

I want him to turn this around and be brilliant again, and the good news is that both he and Everton have a track record of improving massively in the second half of the season. Unfortunately, Roberto's record comes from several seasons of escaping relegation. Or *almost* escaping relegation in one obvious case.

We started this season badly (pissing away points against Leicester and Arsenal, then getting spanked by Chelsea), and now at the halfway point we're significantly worse. We've done well in the Europa so far, but we're not just playing in the Europa. We're genuinely struggling in the league. This is our month-by-month record in the league (not including January, because I imagine people would just jump all over me if I did):

* August - 2 points from three games 
* September - 4 points from three games 
* October - 6 points from three games 
* November - 5 points from four games 
* December - 4 points from six games

October is the only month where we've managed more than one league win, when we beat both Villa and Burnley. We have 21 points from 20 games. In the 2010-11 season, we had 22 points at this point and still finished 7th, and that was with a much worse squad than our current one (top scorers were Jermaine Beckford and Louis Saha, who each had 10), but this is still our lowest number of points at this stage since the 2005-06 season. We finished 11th that year, the last time we ended up in the bottom half. We're supposed to be moving forwards.

We've had three clean sheets in the league, against a Swansea side who took Bony off after an hour, and played the last 20 minutes of the game with ten men, against West Brom, who are in a genuine relegation battle and against Villa, who have only scored 11 goals this season. But are still above us.

We've conceded three or more goals in five separate games so far - Chelsea are obviously a top side, but the other four were against Palace, Swansea, Southampton and Newcastle.

Last season was great. But so far this season has been the worst in quite some time. There's plenty of time for things to get better, but with every bad result, the ceiling lowers a little bit on just how much better it can get. There's also time for things to get much worse, and after four defeats in a row, where we've conceded nine goals and scored two, I think there's a valid argument to be made that we're not heading in the right direction. It's not like we're only just off the level of last year, either. It's been a pretty huge drop-off both in results and the quality of football, and ultimately questions have to be asked of the manager. It's up to him to get the team in shape for the next match - tactically, mentally and physically. Something's going very wrong somewhere, and to one degree or another it's been that way since the summer.

On average, over these last four games we've had 55% possession. We all know this is the gameplan. But the gameplan isn't working, and Roberto isn't doing anything to change it. Is that commitment to his ideals, or is it foolhardy? Worse, is it a lack of ability? The possession game is great when the team is confident and winning matches, but our team is a long way away from that and without that confidence, how is the same old plan supposed to turn things around? Are we supposed to just hope we come up against a team even lower on confidence than us? Because we've got overachieving West Ham next, followed by title-challengers Man City before we get to the games against West Brom and Palace that we *should* be expecting to win.

I don't want him fired. I want him to do well. But he *isn't* doing well, and the signs over the last two months are that Roberto isn't willing to compromise his footballing style for the sake of getting a result, and that's been costing the team significantly. Nine points from our last eleven matches is shocking form.

Refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine.  
Refrain from using economic pressure on Ukraine in order to influence its politics.

Brighton property moves fast, especially the nice locations. For a general idea of what you'll get for your money, look on RightMove and Zoopla rentals (pop Brighton into the location search box) or the Argus (a local Brighton newspaper)

http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent.html
http://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/
http://www.theargus.co.uk/homes/homes_for_rent/

If you want a short term rent it'll be more expensive. Flats are apartments (normally one floor), houses are multi-floor or (semi)-detatched properties.

There's loads of local estate agents (letting management companies) in the Brighton area - they are the ones you'll likely end up dealing with even if you start with RightMove or Zoopla.

You can maybe find something cheaper if you flatshare or houseshare - just be very careful about handing over any money to someone before you sign paperwork and get keys.

http://brighton.craigslist.co.uk/

You can get swindled unless you're careful, so be careful!

Jobs - I'll leave that for someone else to help with.

&gt; E-cig discussion general I suppose

Alright! Am an ecig user / 'vaper'. In about a fortnight I'll have been vaping (and not smoking) for 2 years, but have been vaping in conjunction with smoking for 2 years prior to that.

One of the things that everyone asks upon seeing that I use an EC, is whether or not I'm using it as a tool to give up smoking.

No. I'm not. I like nicotine, and I feel this is the least harmful/most convenient way of enjoying nicotine. Smoking is terrible for you, no argument there, but the harm is caused by carcinogens and tar. Yes, nicotine is highly addictive, yes, addiction is bad, but it's far better to be addicted to something which doesn't harm you as much.

*But wait - it hasn't undergone proper tests - the research still needs to be done!* etc etc.

E-liquid generally contains 2 ingredients: nicotine liquid, and propylene glycol or vegetable glycol. The glycol is there to create the nice fog and is used to dilute the nicotine to a strength appropriate to your tastes. Other uses for these two glycols? Smoke machines, used in clubs and theatres.

Getting your nicotine fix from an ecig over a fag *has to be* healthier.


*So it's all good?* Mostly:

* It's far far cheaper (£6/week after kit-costs) to vape than smoke. 
* You can vape in more places than you can smoke.
* You won't smell, and if you do, you'll probably smell of cherries, at least until the novelty of these flavours wears off.
* Strictly in terms of volume you'll carry less gubbins. (Lighter, packet/papers, tips 'n baccy)
* If quitting nicotine is your aim, assuming you don't find vaping unpleasant (the vapour will initially feel harsher), then you can used the various strengths to ween yourself off. I'm enjoying nicotine at a very mild level now.
* Fags oblige you to finish them or be wasteful. There's no waste with an ecig.

However...

* Fags have a start-point and an end-point; sparking-up = start, ember approaching the filter = end. The only limiting factor in smoking an ecig is the battery capacity and the reservoir capacity. What I'm saying is fags have a fixed duration, whereas ecigs don't, so you have to decide when you stop. It's possible to vape for far longer than you would have otherwise smoked, and you can make yourself feel queasy if you over-do it with the vape.

As I see it, my nicotine use is probably one of my least damaging vices now. Caffeine, alcohol and the internet probably do more harm to my life. 

That's my experience as an ecig user.",null,0,null,1420136543,null,0,1420136958,1,cnbboow,null,t3_2r0qgl,null,t1_cnbboow,null,t3_2r0qgl,null,null,null,1425115112,null,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15,null

1. We're getting close to relegation, and we shouldn't be.  It feels like his style is leading us down that path.  It feels like the whole of the team is not greater than the sum of its parts.  I can't help but think that some of the players are actually being brought down by this.  At this point, I genuinely wonder whether Roberto Martinez is better than playing the odds and seeing who is available.

2. I don't really know, to be honest.  With all our history, we can't be that enticing of a prospect. We just don't have the same money as other top teams.  Inheriting an Everton team with 21 points after 20 games isn't much better than inheriting a Stoke, Villa, Swansea, etc. team.

but if he can learn from lamps how to move in the box, find space for headers and tap ins also, that would help him a lot more.

We're suffering for having him in the XI.

I don't know whether I want it to be Rodgers being clueless for changing a winning formula for no reason from Swansea, or Gerrard selfishly forcing his hand. Neither bode well.

When we got hammered by Arsenal before Lescott left showed what happened when this was spirit was challenged IMO. Moyes had the reputation for dithering in the transfer market but I appreciated he wanted to get the right personalities in the team. There maybe something in having a smaller, tighter squad that brings a bit of togetherness. Moyes also was a no nonsense guy, he was like that teacher who you didn't mind was strict because he taught you well.
Martinez has a really big squad compared to Moyes, and a real mix of personalities and backgrounds, I fear he is losing that togetherness that Moyes spent so much time developing. 

This article pretty much sums it up re: Moyes, especially his quote saying the players passionately believed in the team.

The compensation scheme wasn't great. Firstly, even &lt;30min late is bad, if it happens a lot on what should be quite a short commute. No compensation at all if the train is 25 minutes late every single day.

Then, for each late train you get 1/14 of the weekly ticket (7 day ticket even though most people only use 5 days, deliberate to reduce the compensation) if the train is 1 hour late. Less if it is only 55 minutes late. And you have to fill out a massive form to get it.

The problem for me with all these players is that they all seem to need other people playing well to shine, but instead they are the best we have, and it hasn't been enough to convincingly beat anyone but a sub-par Tottenham and Swansea. In the same way that Delph can look the outstanding player in a hapless villa team, or Berahino can be West Brom's biggest attacking threat.

Don't believe it!  :D

I've got 2 pencil cases with my ""main"" gubbins in that I keep around me.

I keep the liquid one with me basically all the time, in the glovebox in the car i I'm out for the day kind of thing.

Then, if you dare, take a look at my kitchen drawer.. Bits and bobs of all kinds, kanthal wire, couple of dripper bottles, bottles of VG/PG, bags of sterilised cotton wool, syringes, bits of battery.. 

Of course, shinyitis does not help. Every time I go to one of my local shops I come out with something else to play with..  Still a shedload cheaper than the fags though...

I don't regret a single bit of it. Even with buying lots of shiny things, various juices to try and sample, I've still saved a hell of a chunk of money, also I'm not coughing my heart out when I wake up, not blowing for tugs as much climbing the stairs and more than anything I can smell smokers a mile away now, and to think I used to be like that. My fingers are flesh coloured again, and I'm no longer trimming slightly nicotene-stained face fuzz.

When it comes to money, I will have some funds when I move. That is I am in the process of gathering some funds since I don't intend to move there penniless and because I've been told before that when I start renting there will be a required deposit and payment of the first month at least.

Cahill has shown he just isn't good enough. He falls to pieces in crucial games and we just can't have that. Either Zouma needs to step up or we need to bring in someone who can do the job. I'm tired of seeing him screw up every game, he's costing us too many points. 

Everyone was off today, Fabregas couldn't pass at all, neither could Dave. Matic seemed to be off the pace, Oscar might have been recovering but he did nothing. The only player showing some kind of passion was Hazard. If it wasn't for him we could have lost by a lot more.

Ivanovic cost us the penalty not Cahill why the fuck was he passing back then, if Cahill didnt foul then Kane would have scored anyway. **I heard we should have got 2 penalties is that true? Dowd is in charge the cunt anyway hes made mistakes since ive been watching**. Matic made a run as he does turned players massive gap for costa to run into and all hes got to do is slot it past the goalkeeper for an easy goal, guess what no run is made and this is a problem weve seen time and time again he played well against West Ham but hes gone back to poaching fucking great.

Chances we had in the last 5 minutes. 

*Ramires: should have scored but it was a whisker wide and its his first game back

*Azpillicueta nice try good shot, unlucky Ramires for it not to fall for him

*Terry just scored

*Salah scuffed it and should have scored

Abysmal defending and average attack. Our attacking in every game is too systematic and even we are down by 3 we play like we are 5-0 up fucking passing the ball back. If we were gonna get a point we needed to press all out at 60 mintues. If the match is lost at 3 goals down go all fucking out. Maybe we are trying to conserve goals for GD but shit defending didnt stop that when we went down they got 6. Fucking hate Harry Kane hes having a good spell, but hes not going to become a top striker or hold this up, its nothing less than cock shit fucking defending from cahill all game that gave him his goals. I saw a replay of his first goal. absolutely fucking pathetic. All started at Sunderland when we couldnt adapt properly and it carried on being shit from there. Citys level and we will throw away the title if we carry on playing like this when we are down.

Just like Leicester will have heroes from today's game that are getting 10/10 from their fans, but if those players could reach those levels more often, they wouldn't be bottom of the league in the first place The consistency and ability to dominate and outplay all kinds of opponents under different circumstances is the distinguishing characteristic of any top level player, and right now I fear Sturridge is the only player of that calibre we have left :( (although Sterling is on the fast track to becoming one, but if things don't change soon I could see him leaving :/)

Kane MOTM for me. Not just involved in 3 goals, but he kept creating chances on his own and for Chadli, Eriksen and Townsend. It's almost amazing as to how this guy has no particular weakness.

Vertonghen was solid today. Eriksen had the tendency to disappear for long periods of time but when he appears, he really appears with a bang. Chadli was pretty amazing as well. Bentaleb did really well today as well.

I feel like Fazio had a pretty bad game today. His misplaced pass led directly to Chelsea's second goal and he was caught off guard by Azpilicueta near goal.

Townsend looked good until the second half. His fancy backheel attempt nearly cost us a goal as well. And he was invisible for the second half. It was really day and night between the two halves he played.

I think we should give Paulinho a second chance. He was brought on to shore up our midfield and help our defense but despite that he still managed to create chances from what little time he had on the ball.

we all know our defend is shit and need to be improved ,also Hazard can't be a winger alone .

we need to keep fighting !

Offensively we were superb today. can barely pick a fault, we didn't get that many clear cut a chances but we still banged in 5!

Defensively we were not as tight as last week, Vertonghen was a rock and is looking his best again, Fazio was decent but made a few mistakes, one which led to their third, but overall i'm not too worried about his place in the starting 11.

People moan about the winter period, saying its too physically demanding on the players, but we've shown them how its done. We've given everything for 90 minutes and once we cut out the silly mistakes and the lapses in concentration, we can seriously start pushing for greater things. COYS

- Kane runs past just about everyone on our right hand side before scoring the first.

- Ivanovic runs across to cover Chadli(?)'s shot that eventually hits the post, and both Cahill and Terry are so slow to notice Rose's run. They're both culpable in my opinion, although it's ultimately Cahill's fault as he's a) closer to Rose and b) it's his side of the pitch.

- No explanation needed. Cahill takes Kane out when he's running away from goal with no visible danger.

- Again, look how easy Cahill gets beaten: Kane spins him like he's not there. Then Terry doesn't do a great job of dealing with it, though Cahill's still at fault initially.

- The fifth is effectively the same pattern. They exploit that little pocket of space in the vicinity of Ivanovic and Cahill, and then, low and behold, like just about every shot today, it ends up in the back of the net.

I posted this before: 

People, in real life coaching, defensive coaches don't exist. And I'll give you an anology of why they don't.
Everyone here would like a mould of Hyypia or a Carragher. But what they don't realise is that 1) Being a great player doesn't make you a good coach, as in the case of Hyypia who was sacked recently and 2) Carragher talks a good game, but in reality, a person who holds a 
UEFA B license could do just as good an analysis if not better.

What people fail to realise it transitition. And transition from defence to attack. A simple way is this. Say we brought in Hyypia to coach defense. He would 'hypothetically' say to Markovic and Henderson 'Guys, don't go to far forward, we need you to track back and form the 5 man defense'. Rodgers would say 'No, I want to attack and my system and set plays are based on the wings, so you need to go forward'. You see, this is a very very basic idea of what would happen. There would be disagreements on how to play.
There are no 'defensive coaches'. Like I've mentioned before, if they did exist then I'm pretty sure every club in the world, including Madrid and Barca, Bayern and Dortmund, Man Utd and Man City, would have one.

This is coming from personal experience. I once coached at a team where I was responsible for the defending and another coach for the attacking. From a naturally defensive coach, I wanted my team that I was coaching to drop off and defend from the 18 yard box and out, whilst the attacking coach wanted to hold the line and press. I wanted to play on the counter. The attacking coach wanted to keep the ball.

Do you see the problem now guys? It's about being in sync with one another. You'll have to be incredibly lucky to find a coach which not only understands how you want the team to play, but also PREFERS the team to play like that. And what I mean by that is that the defensive coach has to understand the attacking play and vice versa. It's incredibly lucky if you find coaches like that. Simply put, they don't exist. And one way of seeing this is seeing Liverpool under Dalglish. Steve Clarke did the coaching for that team. And that team went through the patch of hitting the post 32 odd times. That wasn't purely down to being unlucky, it was down to Steve Clarke coaching the attacking aspect of our game.

The OP mentioned that we don't coach defending a lot. I can see that. I don't think we practice set piece defending a lot if not at all. I think Rodgers just tells Skrtel to mark this guy and Sakho to mark him etc... Tommy Smith once said that Liverpool never practiced a set-piece under Shanks or Paisley. I don't think Barcelona did much practice on it under Guardiola and Vilanova.

It's not that we don't coach defending that is the problem, it's how we coach it that I don't like. And that's a whole different story. 

In the case of Steve Bould, I was told he was doing basic coaching rather than being clever. You want to be better at set pieces? Well you can fire in crosses at the defender and tell them to head the ball away for 40 mins. But in a coaching session, you can do so much more and Wenger didn't like that. That, however, isn't verified.",null,0,null,1420141217,null,0,false,0,cnbe3py,null,t3_2r0yy3,null,t1_cnbe3py,null,t1_cnbdt9x,null,null,null,1425113985,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

I think we're tired.  I also think that we haven't played the same type of game we started the season with.  We've allowed teams to set up more for the last 6 weeks, especially vs Southampton last week.  We've played slower and not had as many quick balls to Costa.  That may because they're marking him heavy, but we still haven't been playing with much of the same quickness and fluency as the start of the year.  Hazard really carried us today.

Depending on the manor, the seignory can be as little as a few pigs and a horse every year from the village or as much as the right to wear a hat in the presence of the monarch.

As for unofficial preferential treatment, people are far more likely to be rude to you than anything else.

null,false,megauploader001,eng-northumberland,Frog in the North,null,"Yeah, there is a pretty clear answer. Rail services in England are amongst the worst in Europe. They're are very very expensive, they're slow and late whereas countries which didn't privatize their entire rail services have better quality services.

A monthly ticket in London costs roughly £126 (more or less depending on where you commute) and a ticket in Paris (and its suburbs which includes, metro, rer, bus), a city which is known for its excellent public transport costs 60 euros (£46). Nevermind regional trains because they're even worse, I travel often between North Engand and France and the cost this side of the channel is disgraceful, trains are filthy, take double the time to travel the same distance (also somehow almost always late) and also cost twice as much.

Honestly, you can't really say there is no clear answer about whether it's worked or not. Privatisation being good is a myth, it's never worked in any situation because corporations don't give a fuck about people, they want money and they want more and the only way they can squeeze it out of you is to gradually make their services shittier and less efficient.

Complaining about public transport is people's favorite thing everywhere you'll go but having lived in a few different countries, I can assure you that there is plenty to complain about here in the UK.",null,0,null,1420142100,null,0,1420154660,0,cnbejys,null,t3_2r050n,null,t1_cnbejys,null,t1_cnbdt3i,null,null,null,1425113774,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

null,false,oatcrunchie,null,null,null,"&gt; So you really believe that Russia will invade the UK?

I don't believe that's what I said, no.

My point is a wider one about not wanting to be reliant upon other nations for our own defence, coupled with the fact that we live in a changing world and cannot know what the geopolitical situation will be five, ten, twenty years from now.

When the Soviet Union collapsed I couldn't imagine Russia invading ANYONE and I thought that it was a spiffing time for the world to get rid of it's nuclear weapons.

Twenty years later the world is a very different place; who knows how it will look in another twenty?

&gt; By using this argument, you should be equally afraid of china because they annexed Tibet and fucking terrified of Israel because they have very war like tendencies.

What makes you think I'm not afraid of either of them?

Look around at the world we live in. The era of Pax Americana has passed and China is in the ascendancy, a trend that's only going to continue over the next few decades as China's power grows economically and militarily.

Aside from the extra effort that goes into playing any top team, clubs seem to pull even more against us than any other team. Be is because we are somewhat he new boys on the block, jealousy of instant success in a sense and our funds, or hated of mourinho/abramovich. On top of this the officiating in Chelsea games is abhorrent on a game to game basis. Any neutral supporter can tell you Chelsea is denied at least one questionable penalty call every game. Also, teams will chew the clock to an excessive extent. When Chelsea is winning and they chew clock the ref is much much quicker to brandish yellow. We act like popularity only affects things like high school prom voting. But these officials grew up with traditional powers like united and Tottenham and arsenal to an extent. So they are going to naturally be biased. When people try and argue against this you are trying to explain an imperfect world in a perfect way. The only way to fix this is to actually start punishing refs, removing them from leagues, or taking retroactive action on a match. Also, when nobody is allowed to say anything negative about the refs... That is extremely unsettling no? It is something that is CRUCIAL to the match and should constantly be being improved.

Second goal he comes out, makes himself big and forces the shot wide. Hits the post and poor defending from Cahill allows Rose to score the rebound.

Third goal was from the penalty spot, it's a 50/50. He even dives the right way but couldn't keep it out.

Fourth goal was poor defending from Ivan, Cahill and perhaps more importantly Terry as he turns his back to Kane rather than making himself big and getting a foot in. Kane's shot rebounds off Terry's open legs and sails past Courtois who would have otherwise saved it.

Fifth goal, exact same thing happens as with the fourth goal. Literally the same thing, go ahead and watch it again. Rebound off Terry's leg and it sends Courtois the wrong way.

I know it can be seen as ridiculous to say the keeper did no wrong on the end of a conceding 5 goals but this is one of the rare cases where it's actually true.

null,false,robdabank,JE,jersey,null,"&gt; Because it seems like he has stayed at City to win trophies

Reasons Lampard could have stayed at City other than trophies:

- He doesn't have to move to a new country

- He doesn't have to adjust his living situation with his Fiance who is hosting that morning show on ITV

- He's probably gets to see his Dad pretty regularly by staying in England

- He gets to stay and play in (arguably) the most competitive football league in the world

- They're paying him more than Chelsea intended to

- He's making more at MCFC than he would at NYCFC

- He gets to bank more large weekly wages and extend his lifestyle further beyond the end of his playing career

And then you can also tack on the whole ""he's still at a domestic/continental competitive football club"".

Even if Lampard came right out and said ""the issue was money"" I wouldn't be upset. Athletes have a limited shelf life, their earning power goes down as they get closer and go over that 30 year old hump. Lampard's 36 and has a whole life ahead of him - cash in, enjoy your life. Obviously the clubs that are challenging for league titles are the only ones who are going to be able to pay his wage bill. If Chelsea wasn't willing to, really, who else in the league could step up and pay? 

Osgood wasn't a one club man. Tambling wasn't a one club man. Wise wasn't a one club man. Why are we holding the club's top scorer, a guy who has already cemented himself into Chelsea history, to this weirdly high standard.

He is consistently worthless in the final third and I don't give a shit what anybody thinks about his tracking back. A fucking winger's (stop giving him the excuse that he's an attacking midfielder, he plays at the winger position the opposite side to Hazard) best trait shouldn't be defending and running like a headless chicken. 

Sure he had one decent final pass to Costa early in the game, but the rest of the season has been the same deal. Terrible final passes that either go straight to a defender or behind the recipient slowing the play down. God awful shooting that's either with no power, on the ground and straight to the keeper or sailing 10 yards above the crossbar. Never takes on defenders and passing it backwards or sideways. Even does this on counters where he stops, does that stupid right leg pass fake and passes it back to whoever's behind him. I feel like sometimes Ivanovic has to come forward because otherwise there would be zero production from the right side of the field.

I hope Schurrle regains his last season form soon because I'd definitely sacrifice some of Willian's work rate (Schurrle tracks back pretty hard too) for at least a threat offensively at right winger.

Also, the transfer window is open, time for Salah to go, find a sub for Matic, ie. Someone who can actually play football, since Mikel goes for AFC and hopefully never comes back, and buy a new defender. Cahill was just like always, a tragedy. At this rate, I'd take Berbatov as a defender, standing at the same spot for 90 minutes he would do less damage than Gary. Zouma HAS to play instead of Cahill..

Well done by Spurs, this fucking sucks, but they played well. Kane was great, hopefully plays for England. We created chances, could have very well been 6/7-5 to us if we had a little more luck, so that's not worrying. 

Don't get why Mourinho always makes subs when they do absolutely nothing. Like, does he know that he can make subs whenever he wants, not just at half-time and at the fucking 90 minute? we are 4-2 down, get Remy, Drogba on. The fact that he only made 2 subs today is fucking criminal, on top of that, one of them was Salah..

January wish list : Anything that breathes to replace Cahill, Salah -&gt; somewhere far, far away, Mikel off to AFC and staying there. Reus? Don't think he'll move yet. It would be interesting if we recalled Bertrand, Azpi to right and Bertrand/luis at LB. Maybe Khedira to sub Matic, as he needs to rest some time too ?

1. Hazard was amazing as he's always been for us and I love he's taking up the responsibility to carry Chelsea even more.

2. Cahill is amazing on his day but his recent performances have been really disappointing.

3. You can't put all the blame on Cahill, because Freaking Ivanovic makes Cahill's  work super hard at that right hand flank. He's a good outlet when in possession in front but he's not half as good as Zabaleta going forward (because bad crosses + not really fast) and thus, it's difficult for me to justify his defensive lapses. (Maybe a workaholic like Dave will do both jobs better on the right)

4. Talking about Dave, We all love that he gives absolutely everything and leaves nothing on the field, even in days like this. Second to Hazard today.

5. Matic -I don't know what to say. The beast (and his attacking sidekick) really let us down today in the middle of the park. Let's blame fatigue.

6. We all still don't know why Mourinho is very hesitant to use Remy. As an armchair coach, I'd like to think the real coach knows what he's doing.

But now, I want to bring up discussion that I never see anywhere (and seems to be unpopular when I bring it up with my Chelsea friends).

**OSCAR** 

   Am I the only one who thinks he's been under performing really badly for us. I hate to bring Mata up, but since he left, I've been expecting Oscar to come out of his shell and become the super amazing player we all know  he's capable of being, and which we see glimpses of from time to time but lack a great deal of consistency. 
I love his heavy pressing and tracking but I want to see continued brilliance from him, when it comes to dribbling and giving great passes in the attacking third. 

I don't know if maybe I'm expecting a little too much from him, but given I expected him to be a really close second to Hazard in terms of performances, I have to say I'm very disappointed. 

**Then probably what might my most unpopular opinion**

We all agree **Courtois** is amazing, but I've been thinking, not just today but since earlier in the season when we let in many goals. 
I was as excited as any other Chelsea fan to see him between the sticks this season, but after all the inItial euphoria died down, I began wondering, **I got to love CECH so much because he continuously saved a ton of goals that should've definitely been scored and that's what separates good keepers from amazing keepers really. However, it seems that although Courtois had made many top saves, when I see a clear chance for our opponents and I think ""That's a goal"", it's mostly been actual goals and that leaves me somewhat dissapointed.**  Maybe I need to see a video of all his saves to season to change my mind, but I can't help but think that while pretty much all the goals have not been his fault (I think he should've saved Kane's first goal), I feel like Cech might have saved a couple of the goals Courtois has conceded this season.

I want to know what you guys think, especially on Oscar and Courtois. Do I have a point or is nostalgia messing with my mind?

There are 5 principles of defense. Depth (which is also an attacking principle), Pressure/Delay, Cover, Balance and consolidation. 

Playing the higher line = more pressure, less cover. Playing a deeper defensive line = less pressure, more cover.

PRESSURE/DELAY: More closing down, higher pressing = more pressuring the opposition to win the ball back, quicker as well as higher up the pitch when you lose possession. Preventing penetration.

COVER: This is picking up runners, opposition off the ball runners but not closing them down complete whilst keeping your shape/formation. Using an American term, it's 'half pressing' 

Playing the higher line = more focus balance, less on consolidation. Playing a deeper defensive line = less focus on balance, more on consolidation.

BALANCE: Keeping your shape/formation. This is to ensure that width - the opposition stretching your defense, does not create central space through which the opposition can penetrate.

CONSOLIDATION: Very similar but more focused on the opposition and their mobility and off the ball movement... this is mainly of their attacking players, making sure their off the ball movement does not destroy the shape of your defense.

A team that wants to win the ball early will focus on the defensive principle of Pressure, with Cover as a secondary principle. A team that wants to focus on penetration will usually have a target player up front to play up to with runners from midfield attempting to get beyond the target man. A team that wants to focus on possession will need to focus a lot more on Mobility to ensure passing options for the man on the ball at all times, while a team that wants to cut out passes will focus on Balance, ensuring the weakside of the defensive zone is always covered. It is within these principles of play that teams assert their identity as much as in the skills of the individual players. So a 4-4-2 for Rodgers is a different 4-4-2 for Simeone. A vastly different 4-4-2 infact.

Rodgers identifies himself with pressure and cover. But having in players like Gerrard who don't press doesn't make sense. Which is why his criticism of Balotelli didn't either, because Gerrard doesn't press. So firstly, you have to sort out individually, who you want in your team. Cissohoko, for all of his faults, was a very solid defender. Sakho is a solid defender. Johnson isn't. And Skrtel turns his back onto the ball, pulls shirt etc.. So we know the faults of all the players.

So we need to sort out who we want in our defence. 

Then we practice that partnership out. We put crosses for them to head away. We control the space infront of the ball. It's standard defensive coaching, nothing special. I can't go into detail why Rodgers coaching session doesn't aid our defence, it would take far too long. But it's important that we get this defense sorted out. I predicted when Rodgers came in our attacking would be good and defensively we would always struggle but I didn't expect this. 

To me, the best reference points for how we will probably end up playing under BR are Ajax from the md-90's, and Romania from the early to mid-90's. And I will finish my speech now.

For those who support the introduction of said legislation in NI if you are really to be honest and consistent in your reasoning you must,(if your opinion is to have any consistent value) follow it through to its conclusion.
If it is ""right, fair &amp; just"" to legislate for gay marriage because it is ""a  union of people who love each other"" the the definition of marriage MUST also be changed to include sibling marriage, Islamic multiple wives marriages and of course marriages of more than two people (bi sexual arrangements). You will also need to reconsider the age at which marriages can take place, ie marriages for younger teenagers.
Marriage is by definition discriminatory, traditionally it has been between one man one woman above a certain age and not too closely related.
It appears to me that gay activists and supporters do not desire equality for loving relationships, they simply want a different form of discrimination that suits their cause, however their case is presented as a cry for fairness and quality, which of course it isn't.

Manquillo (A typical product of Simeone's coaching!)

Sakho - He's as close as we've got to the ideal defender. 

Toure/Lovren- Although he's prone to errors. But the best we've got ATM. I still maintain Lovren is a good defender in the right system.

Enrique - Hard to bully him off the ball.

Now obviously, Rodgers wants his full backs to attack. So for Rodgers. He would drop Manquillo for Johnson, for his 'supposed' goal threat (!!) and would play Moreno over Enrique because Moreno contributes much more to attack that Enrique. He would also drop Sakho/Toure for Skrtel. Because of his goal threat at set pieces.

So you see, the back 4 largely depends on how you want to play. But if we have the right personnel in place, then our back 4 will improve a lot.

Rodgers defensive coaching is lacking. I don't think he spends enough time on it, although that isn't a huge issue and I certainly don't think that the time he does spend on it is effective. He's a manager who stems from attacking principles and is a coach who would tell Sakho, Skrtel and Can before the game to mark X, Y and Z on a corner.

What I am trying to say is IF we put Azpilicueta on the right and put Filipe Luis on the left, we still have the balance between offense and defense, just on a different side. Luis is so much better at delivering crosses than Ivanovic, while the right side (arguably our most vulnerable side) is covered by a workhorse Azpi. Only thing that will be missing is Ivanovic's physical presence. Just a thought.

When men do fight for custody, they win 63% of the time

&gt;When fathers contest custody, however, studies consistently document that they win at least half of the time. A Los Angeles study showed that when fathers contested custody, they won 63 percent of the time; a Massachusetts study found this to be so in 70 percent of cases. And a 1997 article reviewing custody laws from the 1920s to the 1990s concluded that “when fathers fight for custody they have always had about a 50 percent chance of winning, no matter what arguments or what experts they employ.”

http://povertylaw.pbworks.com/w/page/17976115/perils%20of%20joint%20custody

&gt;We began our investigation of child custody aware of a common perception that there is a bias in favor of women in these decisions. Our research contradicted this perception. Although mothers more frequently get primary physical custody of children following divorce, this practice does not reflect bias but rather the agreement of the parties and the fact that, in most families, mothers have been the primary caretakers of children. Fathers who actively seek custody obtain either primary or joint physical custody over 70% of the time. Reports indicate, however, that in some cases perceptions of gender bias may discourage fathers from seeking custody and stereotypes about fathers may sometimes affect case outcomes. In general, our evidence suggests that the courts hold higher standards for mothers than fathers in custody determinations.

Yeah, what would a professional sociologist with a PhD in sociology who has published in major sociological journals and is an active member of the American Sociological Association know about the sociological definition of racism, right? 

[This](http://www.raceandhistory.com/selfnews/viewnews.cgi?newsid1024893033,80611,.shtml) is a neat article on why there's no such thing as reverse racism. [Here's another](http://feminspire.com/why-reverse-racism-isnt-real/) if you don't believe the first. 

&gt;They blame some problems on uncontrolled immigration, but exclusively those where rapid population growth is a reasonable explanation for the problem. 

I just don't accept this, however I don't think it's an assertion that can be proved or disproved. It seems to me that they *do* blame as much as they can get away with upon immigrants.

&gt;Their proposed solution is to treat all immigrants the same, regardless of their origin (the opposite of a racist policy, which would yield superiority and privilidge for some, say, the residents of EU countries, who are over 95% white, while discriminating against others, say the rest of the world's population, who are majority non-white)

Well yeah, I guess I sort of agree with you here. I would like to see a total open door immigration policy, irrespective of the origin of the immigrant. 

But it's absurd to say that only allowing uncontrolled immigration from the EU alone is racist. It theoretically could be, but at the same time it's obviously not.

No, it discriminates based on geographical location. The only reason we have the free movement of people is because the free movement of goods couldn't work otherwise.

Chadli and Eriksen were magnificent today. Who would have thought that the two supposed ""after thoughts"" to last years' Super Seven would be our feature players.  

The youth is the future and I know never to trust ITK, but the one about Lennon, Ade, and Kaboul being against Poch seems legit now.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are sold this January.

I have flip-flopped back and forth on Townsend, but if he can be a traditional right winger who's first instinct is to cross instead of cut in, then he could lock that position down. 

Rose helped Chadli have a monster game, and he played well enough to be in rotation with Davies for the LB spot.  On the right, Walker seems to be regaining his form. 

There is no question anymore Kane is a star striker. It's time to sign an understudy, not attempt to land a big name. (Berahino not Bony)

And finally, I think Lamela is good, but we were better today without him. Chadli, Kane and Eriksen were better with a winger to get the ball in to them instead of a fourth playmaker like Lamela trying to score.

Unless you're a troll, you come off as an abrasive, unhappy person, but I'll try anyway: if Cahill were to break his leg, he'd be out at least a couple months  if not the rest of the season. I like Zouma a lot too, but we really haven't seen that much of him, especially against better competition. Would you really be comfortable with him taking over CB responsibilities in all competitions for the rest of the season, with only Ivanovic as backup (with any experience)? We are already very thin in defense; I cannot see how a bad injury helps our team. I guess you could argue an injury now would leave us the entire transfer window to find a replacement, but that's an uncomfortable situation that drives prices up if a team knows we are desperate. Cahill is in a bad run of form right now (not sure if its all on him or having to cover for Iva is taking a larger toll than we thought; seems like teams have found a weakness and are exploiting it) and I agree with the argument that he is not as quality without Terry next to him, but lets not forget he was in the team of the season just last year and a stalwart in the best defense in the league.

A little shaky in the first half but generally a very physical and gritty performance from him in a battlefield of a midfield. His use of the ball improved as the game opened up in the second half. 

Without any context I think his use of the ball looks sloppier than it actually was, however. 

You see that Bentaleb completed only 80% of his passes, but Dembele was the only central midfielder on the pitch who completed above that. The center of the pitch was a war zone, with Fabregas and Matic completing 71% and 68% of their passes respectively. No one had any time or space. 

What I like about Bentaleb is that A) he never hides and B) he's far more physical than people give him credit. If he bulks up a little he is going to be an absolute beast of a ball-winner in addition to his composure on the ball. 

I think he and Dembele arguably won the midfield battle against two of the best players in the league. Mousa was very tidy and didn't give the ball away, Bentaleb brought the energy and aggression.

&gt;women are significantly less likely than men to participate in campaign-orientated activities, such as contacting a politician and donating money to, working for, or being a member of, a political party. (p.7) 

There are less women who are politically active.

&gt;Overall, a statistically significant activism
gap by gender exists in the UK (p.7)

More needs to be done to encourage women to be more politically active. How can you expect equality of outcome when there is not equality of participation?

&gt; men are consistently more active than women across all age groups. (p.10)

This is probably why: 
&gt;Women also express less interest in politics than men, are less likely to regard politics as important and less likely to trust a range of political institutions. (p.11)

My problem with affirmative action/positive discrimination is that it does not address the root causes of behaviour, and it denies individual agency. It's a short-term, band-aid solution to much deeper social issues. The solution is to encourage more women to become active politically, and to put themselves forward for election.

Her air carrier might have asked for confirmation that it was a normal pregnancy without any expected problems - but she may have been just outside of that window.

However she should have declared the pregnancy to her insurer.

Either she did and she's worried because insurance companies like to drag their heels.

Or she didn't and in which case she was acting irresponsibly and will owe the money.

I think it's extremely unlikely that anyone would travel while pregnant without sorting out their travel insurance properly, so it seems like it's a scaremongery story with hack journalism and her insurance company will sort her out.

It is sad that even after I took the 5 minutes to reply to this customer in detail (rather than send a template message as most companies do), explaining why the requirements are strict and giving advice on how to achieve better quality images, their response is not to try again or take the advice but get 'revenge' by posting something bad about BitBargain on Reddit.

I get the frustration part, but coming up with 'they sell your data' out of thin air just because you didn't get verified is close to a criminal matter.

I'm probably lucky because you are very easy to discredit. You claim to know that we're ""selling data"" but you still sent us your information and documents? That is nonsense. As soon as you gave up with the verification (which is a pity, the image quality wasn't completely bad but not quite good enough to be accepted) you decided to post this rant on Reddit. Even to someone who doesn't know what we're about and hasn't verified themselves this story will be suspect to say the least.

Complaining publicly about the strict requirements we have for verification is one thing. Coming up with a lie to make your post hit harder is very unethical and probably illegal too. Please imagine for a second that you have a business, you go the extra mile even against profits to be reasonable and friendly and honest, and one day you see someone you tried to help spread a lie on a public forum.

&gt; other photo's you sent where 'BLURRY'


Zoom in at 100% and tell me you see the lines in the background clearly. You don't. You'd have to zoom out and look at basically a lower resolution to not see the blurriness (and also not see the lines). We look at the 100% version.

Edit: here are the OP's last 3 uploads, and 2 others that were recently uploaded and accepted.

https://bitbargain.co.uk/s/img/quality_requirement.png

This image is now shown on the verification page as reference, to explain the requirements. Hopefully this will reduce the number of frustrated people who are not sure what 'clear' and 'high resolution' means.


&gt; they'll never verify you 


Here are the **actual** statistics:

    Users: 72,197. Traded: 28,684. In the last 30 days: 3,083 buyers.
    Verified Phone: 20,121 users. ID: 5,752 users. Bank: 856 users.

**Bottom line: there are over 5,000 (close to 6k) verified users.**


You did not even need to verify to buy bitcoins on BitBargain at all. All this nonsense for nothing :-(


&gt; Trust me since i witnessed this myself i have stumbled across countless debates on forums regarding the sincerity of this firm and what they do with your info.

By all means if you witnessed it for yourself that we sold anyone's information, please warn the others and provide some kind of convincing proof or evidence. I'd be interested to see even the 'debate' you are referring to but didn't link (not that it would be proof of anything if it existed - by that logic, your rant on Reddit is proof).

Obviously I know for a fact I've never sold anyone's details and I personally have sole access to the database. It feels wrong even to be talking about this and defend myself even though I never did anything to be put in this situation except reject your uploads.

We have a very good reason to require clear and high resolution images. We have plenty of fake ID's (and even selfies!) that were sent to us in an attempt to get verified status. And some of them are very convincing. I think we did a great job so far having a **0%** fraud rate from verified users, but we couldn't do this with low resolution or partially blurry images.

In short: you could have spared yourself the frustration if you took the instructions and the advice seriously and looked at the images at 100% resolution before uploading them.

He is very similar to cech, a very good keeper, behind a good defence, but most ""unstoppable"" shots would beat cech, there are keepers however that do  stop them. Have a look at this and look at how similar the coming and not being in control of the one one was similar to the southampton goal.

then look at this one, most people would say ""unstoppable"", but the reality is, Courtious is making mistakes, small ones, like the examples I used but they make the difference. I don't think with Neueur in net, or even Cech, that Chelsea conceed 5 today

However, the morning train is an hour's difference in departure time - an hour and 30 minutes if I can arrive a bit after 8am instead of needing to be on-time - and that's significant inconvenience for me, just to save my employer some money. Like many employees, I'd expect recompense for that, which means that it's cheaper to run the private hire for me and a colleague than it is to pay me for the hour's overtime that having me hang around in London for 75 minutes would cost you.

null,false,Crimsoneer,eu,London,null," The argument about the current rail system has been argued by umpteen hundred economists, and there has been no clear answer.  Is our rail service very expensive, comparatively?  Undeniably.  But the equation is far more complicated than that.  Rail travel dropped enormously under BR - it had been dropping consistently since the rail service was ""agglomerated"" during the war, and has since increased dramatically to an all time high.  Between 1998 and 2011, the UK saw a rise in average rail journeys of 62%, compared to 33 in France and 16 in Germany.

There's no arguing SNCF is better than our system, but unlike SNCF, if you don't take the train, you (mostly) don't pay for it.  The French state is very bigger and more expensive.  You get perks such as great healthcare and transport, you pay for it with a big state, higher unemployment and more striking and nepotism (I say this as a French person who was educated in a French school whose teachers inevitably went on strike three times a year).  And taxes.

 Prices have gone up, but season tickets have gone up, but season [ticket prices have actually kept up with inflation, give or take.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21056703)  

In the meantime, consumer satisfaction is pretty damn close to an all time high.

Rail infrastructure has always been very expensive in the UK - there is no good evidence that's to do with privatisation.

First, ""Script kiddies"" are very common in the Middle East. Bit like you get more hackers in China. It's just a geo-demographical thing. It's ""cool"" to be able to 'hack' websites down there in the same way it's cool to be able to do a hand-stand. Speaking from first hand experience. Those are not serious hackers, like you say, they're probably just teenagers with Sub7 and a few other shitty tools sitting behind a VPN via a primitive ADSL connection.

Secondly and **more importantly**, the website (from what I can gather by investigating the cached version) was built on an outdated copy of WordPress and was running multiple 3rd party plugins, all of which are very easily hackable, including a geometrics plugin, a cache plugin, and an anti-spam plugin, all of which are ports into the MySQL db. So chances are the website was brought down using a stock script and was not specifically targeted. But still, this really grinds my gears because the vast majority of the public won't deduce this - People will just take a quick glance and assume that Arabs/Muslims are all arse holes. (And I don't blame them - This is a fair assumption considering the circumstances)

Note that it says on p10 ""if you want to apply for less than the maximum available to you, please state the amount"" - so it is easy to choose to reduce the loan. According to a studentroom thread giving advice to a Muslim student (some of whom aren't allowed interest-bearing loans), there is apparently a note on the online version of the application form as follows:
&gt;Then, on the penultimate page of the online application, it asks you whether you want to apply for either of the loans. It explicitly states that your application for the grant will be processed even if you don't want either loan. It also states something to the effect of ""If you only want to apply for the grant, but not the maintenance loan or tuition loan, select 'no' for both questions"". If you select 'no' to both loans then it recalculates your estimated awards - zero for both the loans, and whatever the amount of grant you're eligible for.

Depends on how people get the link, I think.

If you start here:  
http://www.johnpye.co.uk/project/public-auction-marchington-viewing-monday-5th-jan-preview-online/ 

and click on the ""CLICK HERE FOR LOTS, PHOTOS &amp; ONLINE BIDDING"" link it will take you to this cover page:

http://www.auction-solutions.co.uk/auction_details.asp?saleid=1548&amp;siteid=1

which states in red: 

&gt; + Buyers Premium (bp):	20%
&gt; + VAT (on top of bid &amp; bp):	20%

It's possible one could be sent a link directly to the auction like this one:

http://www.auction-solutions.co.uk/lot_list.asp?saleid=1548&amp;siteid=1

But if you click on ""bid"" you get to another page which states that VAT and the Buyer's Premium is payable - a [total of three times](http://i.imgur.com/1kP1gpc.png).

On top of that, not ONE provider did better than the average unemployed person left the hell alone, in finding work.

Just fire the lot of em for being incompetent, and put maybe 10% of that budget into non profits and charities who help the unemployed find work, because volunteers are there to help, not just because they have to be to get paid.

Today, Gerrard played 90 minutes needlessly when we've just cracked a formation/line-up that has long term possibilities, utilises our players' strengths well and made us look effective in attack. Meanwhile, Frank Lampard came on at 70 minutes against Sunderland, scored and won Man City 3 points. 


Rodgers has had this deluded idea that he needs to constantly reinforce Gerrard's ""crucial"" nature to the team to the point where it's like we can't do without him. He's put pressure on an aging player who likely knows himself that he isn't what he used to be and put himself as a manager in a needlessly awkward position. He's talked himself into a situation where it's almost impossible for him to leave Gerrard out without an excuse of ""resting"" him. The end result is, we're playing him in matches that don't suit him, starting him far too much and also limiting the development of really promising players like Henderson.

Here are the posotives, he's tall so he's good in the air. He has good reactions and is a good shot stopper. 

Now here's what been happening all season as everyone has been sucking his dick.

* He rarely plants his foot forward and dives toward the angle cutting down the size of the goal. He's likely gotten away with it growing up because of his height. Next time a replay comes in of him getting scored on watch the foot on the side the goal goes in. He either goes directly sideways or drops it underneath him and goes to a knee, neither of these things cuts off an angle.

*    He has bad hands. More so than Llorris or de gea or other better keepers in the league he rarely will hold on to a ball off of a save, he's a rebound machine. I can't remember the last time I saw him smother a ball instead of let it hit into his legs. Sometimes you cannot hold onto a ball, fair enough. Compared to other high level keepers his rebound often go to direct to where the opposing team is running in. An example of a good keeper using a strong hand to push the ball awat was LLorris pushing ceasar's shot hard away to the outside so it took the rebound away from ramires. It's a necessity that he doesn't do when he should, a lot of our goals were rebounds up the center (man u, man city off the top of my head) that sometimes he gets away with because of our cb's usually being up for covering it.

*  I see our defense not being organized by him. Every other keeper even on teams at the bottom of the table will be pointing and yelling after a goal or ideally as a team is coming at him. I rarely see the kid opening his mouth. I think I see more distrust from the back line because of this. But that's something I can't describe unless you've been a keeper and you can see them drop back further when they should know their keeper has it. Or trying to be in dover position instead of leaving him to do his job which leaves other areas of the box exposed.  

* he makes the saves he's supposed to and that's it. I rarely see him make a save that takes a goal away from the other team. That's what world class keepers do and he does not do that. There are keepers on other teams that do this. When it comes down to the title he wont do this for us.

If he doesn't make his peace with that soon, he won't be getting another contract offer.
