null,false,agaybabby,null,null,null,"The amount that you pay on tuition fees isn’t dictated purely by what tuition fees are set but more by what you earn after you leave university.

After leaving, students repay 9% of everything they earn above a £21,000 a year threshold. And this threshold is set to rise with average earnings from 2017 

A graduate would then continue to repay until they had cleared what they borrowed plus interest, or until 30 years had elapsed since the April after they graduated – whichever comes first 

In practice, all but the highest-earning students after university will be repaying for the whole of the 30 years.

Reduce tuition fees to £6,000 and only high earners gain

So let’s examine the real impact of this policy. The only people who would gain from it are those who would clear their entire loan for tuition fees plus any loans for living costs, plus the interest, within the 30 years. To do this you’d need to be a high earner.

To see the exact amount, go to my student finance calculator and play about with different scenarios – watching the impact of reducing tuition fees. It shows that only those with a STARTING SALARY of at least £35,000 – and then rising by above inflation each year after – would pay less if you cut tuition fees (we have assumed the student also takes out £5,555 in maintenance loans per year).

That’s a very high amount, mainly only City law firms, accountancy firms and investment banks pay that much as starting salaries. Is that really who Labour wants to target with this plan?

Thus, while it seems counter logical, cutting tuition fees this way risks being a regressive rather than a progressive policy – in other words it benefits those with more rather than those with less.

NB. The student finance calculator makes some assumptions over future rates of inflation and average earnings growth, changing those changes the answers – which the calculator allows you to do. Yet I’m using some pretty standard assumptions here.

There is a psychological gain to cutting tuition fees

The one positive of this plan is that cutting tuition fees is likely to reduce fear among those who don’t understand the system. Yet instead of spending billions to do this, why not spend £100 million on financial education for potential students and their parents to fight unfounded fears?

This is something I did with the Independent Taskforce for Student Finance Information that I chaired and we achieved fantastic results explaining the system with less than £100,000, never mind £100 million.

If I were in charge I’d up the repayment threshold and change the name

Much of this whole issue centres around the confusion over who is “rich”. Who is more/less deserving of help: a student from a wealthy background with a low income after university, or a student from a poor background with a high income after university?

We should ensure those from non-traditional university backgrounds aren’t unnecessarily put off university by the fear of debt. Yet we shouldn’t be doing that by pumping in extra cash to hugely affluent graduates.

If you want a more progressive system – and to stop the marketisation of universities (ie, different courses, different prices) – then make them all £9,000 but increase the repayment threshold, for example to 12% of everything earned above £30,000 (that’s a rough example, not a fully worked figure). Though of course that’d cost the Exchequer billions too…

And just as importantly to fight off fear – change the name! Student loans are as much a tax as a loan, in fact they’re somewhere between the two, and as I’ve said before (see student loans aren’t a debt – change the name to avoid a national tragedy), calling it a graduate contribution would both be more accurate and promote better understanding.

Not wanting to be a naysayer, but I work in personal injury claims, and you can't rely on the above statement holding true forever. The number of times people say they are fine but then get chatting to a 'bloke in the pub' or get hassled by a claims management company, dollar signs flash up and the minor whiplash claim duly follows. 

You might want to consider this, as it could transpire that you pay privately for the minor damage to preserve your NCD and then some time in the next three years your insurer gets an injury claim in, (which despite the minor nature of the accident they will probably agree to pay) and you will be left with the option of either paying the injury claim out of your own pocket (with costs, perhaps 3 grand?) Or alternatively still being out of pocket for the damage that you paid for AND having the claim against your policy anyway.

You met the third party, so you will be better to judge whether they are sincerely not going to make a claim, but be aware that this sort of scenario could catch you out.

I deal with this sort of thing all day so if you've got any more questions give me a shout.

Edit:  I should add that this was not my perception during the first season.  The first season felt very ""story first, sex second"" to me.  But then, at some point, it was as if someone decided that all anyone really cared about was the sex, so it was all centered around that going forward.

So it is not perhaps 'fully' costed, but it has definitely been estimated somewhat accurately.
 
The manifesto will include the entire the budget. Which is what really matters:

I don't like the idea that each policy has to have a single matching 'number' to pay for it. That isn't really how our tax system works, it *pretty much* all goes into one big spending pot...

As long as the overall budgetary position makes sense and the cost of the policy (and savings is brings) has been calculated properly then it is 'realistic'.


It is also much more difficult for the greens to cost policy as they have no access to the civil service, the ""main"" opposition (so only Labour) is provided with pre-election access to budgetary numbers and the conservatives and lib-dems obviously already have these.

Oo, here's an interesting page, http://www.rospa.com/leisuresafety/adviceandinformation/playsafety/trampolines.aspx

&gt; Most research on outdoor trampoline injuries is from the USA where, due to the high injury rate the American Academy of Paediatrics, their use is not recommended by them. Most serious injuries are to the head and neck and often occur when children try to somersault and land on their head or neck instead of their feet.

&gt; It is appreciated that whilst not common in the UK there is an increasing trend to provide these, particularly at commercial play centres. **Both RoSPA and British Gymnastics advise against their use unless a properly qualified British Gymnastics Coach is present. The risks of successful litigation in the event of an accident are high.**

I lost all my confidence in my riding ability (partly thanks to macho idiots with arms like christmas hams telling me ""it's all in the technique"" and insinuating I was just being silly).

Anyway, I got another YBR about 3 months ago because it was cheap and the last time I remembered being happy and confident on a bike was with a YBR. It was a good call actually, because it really did bring my confidence right back, but I also remembered how frustrating the lack of power was. The fazer was an awful choice for me back in 2010 but the Ducati on the other hand is ideal. Low centre of gravity, low seat, nice riding position. It's heavy, and I really don't want to drop it ever but I feel a lot more confident handling it on the ground because it's just so compact.

Sorry, that turned into an essay. I was looking out for used ER500s on gumtree for ages because they've got the same things going for them... but when the Ducati turned up... it was just meant to be.",null,0,null,1424899968,null,0,false,0,cox42yg,null,t3_2x56yr,null,t1_cox42yg,null,t1_cox3n6w,null,null,null,1427454659,null,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1,null

It is a bit far out of the city, but there are bus stops just around the block that take you directly to the city center.

It would be worth contacting them directly about getting a ground floor unit.  I stayed my first two nights in another dorm closer to the city center and ended up with a 5th floor walk up room and had to drag all my luggage up the stairs.

Also, don't presume that any flat or room you rent will have air conditioning.  While it wasn't very hot while I was there, it can get pretty warm during the day and there isn't always air conditioning around.  Keep this in mind if your grandmother is sensitive to the heat.

The UK wide parties could use deputies in the regional debate, or leaders. Depends on how big a flag they want to show.

The ""English"" debate would essentially be the main show. Whether four entire debates is logistically manageable, I don't know. Certainly for the parties it would be a preparation nightmare, and Cameron / Milliband might implode due to the amount of arguments they have to remember.

The conspiracy theorist in me thinks that the Tories don't want a debate at all, because they will bleed support to UKIP due to the public being morons. They tried to push for regional parties, in the hope the debate wouldn't happen. Now it is, they've roped in the DUP to throw a spanner in the works and have the whole thing called off.

Although we do get to see more of his past and get to know more about him, there are a couple of episodes that deal with that which I enjoyed a lot.  
  
The other characters of TW vary, but you're bound to find one or two that you like at least. The stories also vary in quality, a lot of people were put off TW by the first couple of episodes, and IMO, those episodes are pretty terrible.

You can help get more firms fined by reporting your nuisance calls - we've [made a tool](http://www.which.co.uk/campaigns/nuisance-calls-and-texts/) to direct you to the right place to report them.

The term ""white genocide"" can generally be considered to be on our shitlist, yes- for fairly obvious reasons. ""Ethnic cleansing"" in the context you were employing it in earlier was absolutely out of order- it's a term with *extremely* loaded historic baggage, and to employ it with reference to a context as innocuous as interracial marrage and immigration from non-white countries is, frankly, the sort of naked propaganda I'd expect to hear from a National Action pamphlet. You're better than that. 

We're cutting you slack because of your track record as an excellent poster in the community, long history of great contributions, and the fact that we *like* you. But please, don't push things? You know why this place was set up- it's flat-out *not* a place where right-wing positions are forbidden, by any stretch- we're open to all. But the anti-racism/dogwhistling/white nationalist ruleset exists for a reason- it's possible to discuss these sensitive issues (and, like it or not, they matter to people- so discussion is warranted) *without* descending to the point of implicitly equating non-white immigration with the Bosnian genocide.

Some Sympathy. Some. For the Motives. That's not ""sympathy for the terrorists"". That's not support. In fact, that figure should be higher - 78% of the respondents found pictures of the prophet deeply offensive. So clearly they do sympahtise with the terrorists motives. If someone murdered thousands of people based on their incorrect use of their they're and there. I would sympathise with their motive, but it wouldn't stop me thinking their fucking nuts and completely condemning their actions. 



So setting that aside for a moment, the rest of his article is a fucking travesty. Criticising the BBC for its headline when you're headline is a complete misquote of the data? The whole Stephen Lawrence canard -there's literally no comparison, a crime with no real motive, whose newsworthy status was mainly to do with the police response rather than the crime. He then goes on to claim that his imaginary poll about a completely unrelated scenario *totally* backs up what he says. Nuts. 

&gt;a large number of British Muslims think the Charlie Hebdo attacks were in some way justified.


Again, conclusions in search of data. The truth is that there's no data to support that. What there is, is data to support *far* less reaching conclusions, which Dan would like to conflate. I don't agree, and frankly, the prejudice he's clearly bought to these numbers reflect on him rather than anything else. It's frankly quite ridiculous he goes on to say that is a ""fact"".

Here are some additional things I've learned about this issue since then or just left out last time due to boredom/exhaustion:

* In 1983, Labour ran on a platform of withdrawal from the EEC. After the referendum on EEC membership in 1975, this was the second time in less than a decade that the British people had the opportunity to vote against immigration from Europe. Labour lost.

* The Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, was signed in early 1992. Later that year, John Major's Conservative Party won the highest number of popular votes by any British party *ever*. That is, the electorate voted hugely for a party that had just locked them in to a political union of which immigration was a core pillar.

* In 2005, Michael Howard's Conservatives ran on a strong anti-immigrant campaign which included the slogan 'It's not racist to impose limits on immigration'. They lost.

My point, which I thought I had adequately demonstrated last time, is that the British people have had countless opportunities to demonstrate their antipathy to immigration at the ballot box and quite routinely failed to do so. Had they voted for anti-EEC/-EU/-immigration parties, their issues would presumably have been addressed. They didn't. Your notion that 'We Weren't Asked' about European immigration is false. Your notion that all parties have always had the same attitudes towards European immigration is false. Stop saying things that are demonstrably false.

null,false,mallardtheduck,null,East Midlands,null,"The thing is, the main ""source"" for information about possible child abuse by official figures in the 1960s-80s was the security services. Remember that the cold war was ongoing at the time and that the climate in which the security services operated back then was very different from now.

As a matter of routine, the security services will investigate any possible ""vulnerabilities"" that an official with access to sensitive information might have. This is so that the security services can do their job in ensuring that such information remains secure.

In the cases where the security services found evidence of such abuse, there was no way that they could release thus to law enforcement, even if they wanted to. Not only would that be outside of their mandate, but the quality of the ""evidence"" would not meet legal standards and the methods used to obtain it would almost certainly make it inadmissible in court and unusable by law enforcement. The security services are looking for possible ways in which the official could be influenced by hostile agents, not watertight legal proof. Not only that, but making such ""vulnerabilities"" widely known would go directly against the purpose of the security services investigation - it would ensure that hostile agents would know how to influence these officials and would provide motive for them to defect (taking national secrets with them) to escape prosecution.

In some cases, it's clear that the security services were so concerned that official channels were used to alert ministers of potential criminal activity. This itself was unusual, so it's clear that such allegations _were_ taken seriously. However, issues such as the lack of usable evidence and the very real risk of compromising national interests during the heights of the cold war were the likely reasons that things were kept quiet at the time. This also explains the possible use of ""D notices"" in cases where security service dossiers were leaked to the press.

Was it right to ""cover up"" such things? No, but it's understandable that those in charge felt they had not alternative.

Not necessarily. Even if you do pay for it yourself, you are required by law to state, if asked, you had an accident when it comes to renewal time regardless of the fact you went through your insurance or not. It would come under ""Accident at fault, NCB unaffacted"" on most websites. If you don't tell them you're committing fraud. Whether or not you get caught out is a different matter.

Also protected NCB doesn't mean your insurance doesn't go up if you have a prang. It still will go up but what they will do is if you had 60% NCB before, they'll apply 60% NCB to the new policy. Basically how it works is that you enter all your details, your accidents etc and a policy price is decided. You are then given a percentage off that price depending on how many years NCB you have. 

Example:

Cost to insure car with no NCB is £1000 with no accidents. You have 60% NCB so you pay £400.

Cost to insure car with no NCB and one declared accident is £1500. You have 60% NCB so you pay £600. ",null,0,null,1424907785,null,0,false,0,cox8zm4,null,t3_2x57nn,null,t1_cox8zm4,null,t3_2x57nn,null,null,null,1427457021,null,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3,null

She is correct. They are both treated with the same weight in law. However if it comes to it, in a civil court which is the one you'd go to with such a dispute, you are asked to prove a contract.

BHAs almost always contain drying alcohol, both acids and alcohol are not recommended in rosacea and are not great for dry skin either. There is a form of salicylic acid that is water soluble but I have only ever seen it for sale as an ingredient on Skin Essential Actives. I am currently experimenting with enzyme exfoliants (see the AHA/ BHA mega reviews) and use mild physical exfoliation in the form of a muslin cloth, 5% urea is another option (see the moisturisers mega reviews).

Retinol is slightly photosensitising and photosensitive itself so can break down/ degrade in light, so is better for night or when you are getting minimal sun/ exposure to bright lights. Vitamin C is better for morning use because it is photoprotective and of course ticks your anti ageing box. We now have three articles on different forms of vitamin C in the ingredients Wiki as well as the mega review threads on retinoids and on vitamin C.

My own routine is somewhat up in the air, but I have not had any issue introducing 1.5% encapsulated retinol to my reactive skin: now on my fourth bottle of Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM, soon to test Ishtar Skinlights 2.5% (they also offer 1%). As a rosacean YMMV of course.

Vitamin C wise it is looking like I will settle alternating an L-ascorbic acid serum with a non acid form to minimise irritation. I am playing with using the L-AA as part of my summer exfoliation to avoid the photosensitivity and irritation associated with glycolic acid.

Is a micellar water definitely enough to shift sunscreen and make up? Could that be contributing to any gunkiness or congestion?

null,false,Vorsa,eng-lestershire,Leicestershire. Ex - Wales,null,"I think people are underestimating the power tuition fee levels have on families from poorer backgrounds. 

It's pretty simple, if you raise tuition fees, the total amount of debt you accrue increases and to parents from poorer backgrounds, that's the major figure they will concentrate on - The higher the value, the more of a de-motivational factor it becomes. 

It's an unfortunate reality, but parents who have never engaged in the higher education system do not understand it. They see thousands of pounds worth of debt at the end of it, and the buck stops there. 

Lowering the tuition fees will not make the poorest graduates any better off and yes, it can be seen as a boost to the higher earners, but if you consider this from the angle of getting students into higher education, it's a step in the right direction. 

A catch all answer is it not, but under the current system it's the best thing they could do to motivate people from all backgrounds to strive for a deeper education, and it's likely the best policy we're going to get from a party that has a fighting chance of gaining a majority government...

You all have the exact same format of entertainment except you are already known by two qualities; having the best song sung by the fans and having a rich history.

Now, focus in on the potential customers. Older ones who care about the history will watch but are unlikely to buy kits. Younger potential customers will buy kits and are easier to turn into life long passionate customers (fans). The TV turns on, the game starts, a weak version of the song barely is audible, the commentators make fun of the silence in the stadium, the away team sings their song louder, you just lost the chance at earning a life-long customer.


OOOOOORRRRRRRR you could keep you tickets cheap, be known for having vociferous fans, sell a hundred thousand more kits over the next decade, and get regular praise from pundits about keeping the prices fair.

(edit: I'm a fairly new fan from America. NBCSN picked up the most popular league for a sport I played in High School. I started watching games here and there. One day I was watching Liverpool and heard YNWA. Soon enough I searched it online and watched everything about Istanbul. Boom, new life long fan. God knows I hated hearing the commentators talk about how timid the Chelsea crowd was. Really, it was the fans of Liverpool who made me love the team. Also, finding out about the Red Sox association helped. Don't like baseball but I do like Boston.) Phew, that was long winded... sorry.

Ah! So if Suarez were a more handsome guy, he might be hated less? I think we're onto something here.

On the flip side, it would also help explain how Cristiano Ronaldo can get away with some of the stuff he pulls. I like this theory.

If he can excel in an entirely dysfunctional side, I see no reason why he can't once the side starts clicking.

And I completely disagree with you about Mason being better than Capoue at attack.  There was an article posted on here about a month ago analysing Mason's play and why Poch is so keen on him, and it said that the only CM player with a higher forward passing percentage, long passing percentage, and completed passing percentage than Mason was Capoue.

Capoue has an incredible long range passing ability.  People on here seem to think he's just a CDM destroyer in the mould of Sandro, and whilst he's tough in the tackle, he's got a lot more to his game than that.  He would regularly spray accurate long balls all around the pitch, and was often our only midfield player trying to get the ball forward consistently.

null,false,I_need_time_to_think,null,Taco Sauce Cunt,null,"You're spot on about practical class demonstrators. There was actually a formal complaint lodged by our year as a whole. I even wrote a letter of complaint after graduating. Students deserved better. Watered down version:

* The level of feedback and returned marks throughout the year was awful and in many cases I’m sure it broke Queens Assessment policy. The biggest culprit for this was Dr. ______ in the CIT Enterprise module. After first semester we were never given back our results for our individual components (development diary and report, both worth a good percentage of the module). At first we were told that we would receive them at the beginning of second semester. As time came to pass people enquired to Dr. _____ again when would receive them and the response was *repeatedly* “within in a few weeks”. Ultimately we never got our results or any kind of feedback. Given we had to have another development diary and report completed by second semester, how could we possibly improve on our original diaries if we never received feedback? It was a similar experience across many modules. 

* The Agile module is not weighted appropriately considering the amount of work involved.

* We were allowed to use online mock exams using QuestionMark for the Multimedia Systems module. However there was often an incorrect answer in the mock exams (the correct answer was marked as being wrong), leaving many students frustrated as to which was right and wrong. If it wasn’t for the group Facebook page set up by students we would never have figured out the “correct” answers. This raises the question ‘Could there be incorrect answers to questions in our final exam’? Also, given that the mock exams were actually exams from prior years, does that mean students from previous years missed out on a few marks?

* Another problem with said module was the appalling assistance provided after Prof. _____’s absence. There was little support provided to us, which could have been arranged as it was known long in advance he would be absent. We were offered a couple of demonstrations where we were told a couple of demonstrators will be able to assist, however there was only one demonstrator (who was not well educated on the subject) and only a small number of students were seen to. 

* So many lecturers were out of office at very inappropriate times throughout the year, especially during exam period.

* For Information Security Systems, a lot of the lecture slides were blatantly copied from Wikipedia, word for word, and most ironically was a lecture on plagiarism (I'm not joking). We out of the blue told we needed a cover sheet for one assignment, just two hours before hand in. By this time most students in groups had already gone home apart from the person tasked with handing it in.  

* **The biggest issue:** I would strongly recommend revising what the Computing and Information Technology course entails *as well as its description in your prospectuses*. It felt as if this course couldn’t decide what it wanted to be.  It states in its description that “This degree is ideal for students who are interested in all aspects of IT infrastructure specification maintenance and administration”. Computer hardware and servers/management was a subject completely neglected bar a single module in level 2, a module which itself never went into much depth about it. Hardware/servers was the primary reason for me joining the course, as well to learn some programming. Had I known the degree would rely so much more on programming I would never have enrolled for it, a sentiment shared by many.

...a year later I seen that the course description was changed, so at least I know they got the letter! Other shitty things include modules which made up 70% of our workload not weighted fairly enough against our degree. For our project (basically the CIT equivalent of a dissertation) we had to give a presentation, you know the *big one*, and the lecturer had his head in his phone most of the time.

I could probably go on. That degree was not worth £3k a year.",null,0,null,1424912064,null,0,1424912359,0,coxb7yu,null,t3_2x0md4,null,t1_coxb7yu,null,t1_cowo3p8,null,null,null,1427458062,null,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3,null

null,false,HorriBliss,null,null,null,"&gt; A 26-year-old who began an affair with an independent school pupil after **kissing him at a leavers' ball** has been banned from teaching for three years.

&gt;Ruth Vaughan, who taught design and technology at Oakham School, Rutland, **kissed the student and swapped numbers with him at the event.**

[...]

&gt; Miss Vaughan also **bought drinks for two pupils who were under 18** in a pub near the school and then **asked them to lie about it when she realised she was facing disciplinary action.** 

&gt; The National Council for Teaching and Leadership found her guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and banned her from teaching for a minimum of three years. 

[...]

&gt; It said the **misconduct findings were “serious” and that Miss Vaughan's actions were sexually motivated, bringing the profession into disrepute by abusing the “uniquely influential role” that teachers hold.**

&gt;Imposing the ban on behalf of Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary, Alan Meyrick, NCTL deputy director, said: **""This is a case in which the teacher has breached acceptable boundaries and has also been dishonest about her actions. These are both serious matters.""**

&gt;However, he noted that **her conduct was “at the lower end of the possible spectrum,” that the incidents did not involve grooming and that she was young and inexperienced.**

&gt;He stated that with time, she might acquire the ability to define boundaries with pupils and so **recommended that the banning order could be reviewed after three years.**

Sounds entirely reasonable.  I'd rather teachers didn't actively talk to students on Facebook until after they've left.  Rumours surfaced that she was flirting with the student before he left school.

Nothing to go to prison over (and she did not), but definitely something to have a stern word to someone about and tell them to fix up (maybe a 3 year ban is exactly what she needs).

null,false,iNarr,null,null,null,"I also can't seem to find anything in the way of credentials on that website. 

For starters, why is everything couched in this vague language that seems to fail to communicate anything essential? Nothing is specific, and there's enough weasel words in all of those descriptions to start a small muskrat farm. What's more, there's these snake-oil promises that claim students will study in ""one of Oxford's oldest colleges"" under the tutelage of an esteemed and ""Ivy-league""-educated teacher, which set off all kinds of alarms for me. If the credentials were of the advertised quality, why not list them? And yet a quick look at the about page (which tellingly reads like yet another sales pitch) reveals that they have no official connection with the University as far as I can tell. If I had to guess, I'd honestly say that this might be a scam. Proceed with caution.

Secondly, they're charging upwards of 2,800 pounds for a 20-day summer camp? That seems like an ungodly sum of money for what you're getting. Also, speaking as a graduate student studying at the University, I've noticed that Oxford keeps a lot of doors closed to visitors. And not just tourists, mind you, but anyone who hasn't matriculated into the University to become a full member of a college. Your mileage may vary of course, but I'm not convinced that 20 days in Oxford as a 'guest' of sorts would give you a very good feel for how the University operates. 

Are you living in the UK already? If so, I'd suggest taking a weekend trip to the city to give your son an opportunity to look around. It'd almost assuredly be as instructive as this program, and it'd be a hell of a lot cheaper, too. I'd actually recommend this route over any summer school in general, since many of these institutions just try to cash in on the Oxford name without offering the authentic experience they're promising.

null,false,AuntieSocial,null,null,null,"This. Hubs and I ended up having to give up two dogs we had when a sudden, unforeseen change in finances forced us to move back in with family. The dogs were great where we had been living - 35 acres of country to run around on and go nuts while we were there to keep an eye on them, with a nice fenced in yard for when we weren't home. But a teeny-tiny fenced in mini-yard in the middle of the city barely big enough for them to trot around in? Yeah, it worked out about as well as you might think. One of the two was fine - chill as fuck, no cares in the world. But her sister was terribly smart yet ridiculously neurotic nutcase (may have been abused before we got them, she had all kinds of fear-response signs pointing to it) and basically spent the whole night *EVERY* night whining in that super-loud way only a dog can and continual barking because of all the cars, people, squirrels, wind...who the hell knows...until one of us would come down (at 4am or so) and personally quiet her down. Otherwise, she'd just keep it up. (FYI, no we could not have brought them inside - we were living with my gran, who's a hoarder living in a small house...there's barely room for people to walk, let alone two medium-sized dogs to move around) I know we had to be keeping everyone on the block up all night, night after night, because of it but nothing we did helped - she knew that if she kept it up, eventually one of us would come out to ""play"" (because really, our other option was to be breaking every noise ordinance law on the books, not to mention being ""those assholes"" with the endlessly barking dog), and she was too smart and neurotic to convince to give it up. The final straw came when she jumped the fucking fence and went after a little yappy lapdog the neighbors continually let run free and that had spent a week or more running around outside the fence harassing the fuck out of our dogs. Luckily, we only ended up paying for the vet bills and weren't legally penalized, but that was *only* because the neighbors were clearly letting their dog run around and ours had been fenced in, so it was a no-clear-fault situation. After that, it was obvious that she was never going to adjust to life in the city, and the two were so strongly pair-bonded that they would both have mini-nervous breakdowns if they were separated even long enough to put one in the vehicle before the other one, so separating them wasn't an option. We ended up tracking down a no-kill shelter in the hopes they could find a better situation. If we'd kept them, the nutso one would have ended up getting shot by some irate sleep-deprived neighbor or euthanized by court order within a very short time, since once she realized that she could get over the fence, it became another way to get our attention (too damned smart for her own good, sadly) and of course the neighbors just went out and got another yappy dog and went back to letting it run around loose (we took to calling it ""Snack Pack"" because it was basically a big-dog snack waiting to happen - ours weren't the only dogs in the area and more than one larger animal roamed the area freely as well...it was literally a matter of time).

Believe me, as a nearly life-long pet owner that decision was one of the hardest I'd ever made, because I don't take on animals if I can't give them a good forever home. We just never saw that particular financial situation coming (in fact, all signs had been pointing in the other direction for a while before disaster hit). And the situation we were forced into was simply untenable for them, us and everyone around us. I still fucking wonder what happened to them, and it tears me up every time that I had to give them up. I just hope it worked out well - they were good, well-trained dogs when they were in the right environment (big yard, lots of room to run, plenty of playtime, and some way for the nutcase to burn off her neurotic energy and occupy her stupid-smart brain with things *other* than getting out so she can play).

null,false,ZippyDan,null,null,null,"A simple thought experiment can determine how real your ""beliefs"" are.  A human and a dog are about to get hit by an oncoming vehicle.  You only have the time to save one.  Which do you choose?

It is actually the same reason you give this mystical greater importance to family: genetic similarity.  So, yes, to any creature, creatures more closely related *should* be more important to them than creatures that are dissimilar.  However, most animals can't really comprehend your question, nor the ideas of importance and similarity.  This lack of comprehension, understanding, and awareness is one reason one someone *might* value a human over an animal, and indeed might value certain humans over other humans.

The ability to love ""unconditionally"" is *useful* to us as pet owners, but is not necessarily a *strength* from the perspective of the animal.  I know a girl who loves her abusive boyfriend ""unconditionally"" despite the fact that he treats her like shit, sleeps around, and makes her feel like a terrible person.  The ability to evaluate whether a person is actually deserving of love is another reason why someone *might* value a human over an animal, or even certain humans over other humans.

Furthermore, your idea of ""family"" seems similarly emotionally blinded.  Just because someone is family doesn't mean they become worth more than your own happiness.  Lots of people have shitty family members that aren't worth their time, energy, or emotions.

That said, you do have one good point, and that is that it all comes down to your own happiness.  Is a life without happiness or the hope of happiness worth living?  Probably not.  If having a dog or cat in your life brings you greater happiness than whatever opportunity you passed up, then that is your own personal decision that I have to respect, because only you know what makes you happy.  However, I also think it is a very short-sighted decision with regards to happiness.  If the opportunity you discarded could provide increased happiness to your future genetic lineage, and you could ensure that your pet is well taken care of in another home, then in the end you are trading some years of happiness in the short term for, possibly, ages of happiness in the long term, especially with regards to your *actual* genetic human family and not your adopted nonhuman family.",null,0,null,1424920208,null,0,false,0,coxfrgz,null,t3_2wv408,null,t1_coxfrgz,null,t1_coxf87p,null,null,null,1427460192,null,0,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,0,null

I had three cats growing up as an only child, and they were very important to me.  But they died by the time I was a teenager, and though I have wanted to have pets since, I also move and travel a lot so I don't want the responsibility.  The pets I had as a kid will have no real effect on my future life, or the life of my kids, beyond the stories I might tell on rare occasions.

And I never meant to imply that pets are ""disposable"".  They are life and we have a responsibility to that life as to any life that is good and not harmful.  Owning a pet is also a responsibility.  My only point is that I would never let a pet determine my future, my happiness, or my success.  A pet does bring happiness, but if the owning of a pet is taking away more happiness than it brings, then it is time to get rid of it, just as I would rid myself of a ""friend"" that is holding me back.  That doesn't mean I would ""dispose"" of the pet, but that I would ensure it can continue to live its life happily and contented with another owner.",null,0,null,1424920535,null,0,1424920997,0,coxfxyw,null,t3_2wv408,null,t1_coxfxyw,null,t1_coxfwc5,null,null,null,1427460276,null,0,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,0,null

Not particularly, if they go into jobs which they could do if they hadn't gone to uni. The cost-benefit argument is tenuous. With a cheap labour force, the UK would have a stronger manufacturing economy, for example. There are too many variables at play to just claim that any degree is useful.

You say you know the ""names"" of your grandparents' pets.  So what?  Let's imagine an example similar to the OPs and lets use your ""forgotten"" great-great-grandparents as an example.  

Imagine you could send a message back in time to your great-great-grandparents.  Imagine your great-great-grandparent has the opportunity to take a job that would make him very wealthy, and your current family even more wealthy by extension.  Or imagine that he has an opportunity to go to a school to become a doctor, and that by his example all the sons and grandsons in the family follow his example, saving many lives.  Whatever the actual opportunity, it would require him to give up one of his pets to another family.  Your great-great-grandfather, whose name you might not even know, and whose pet you don't know, asks you, as the direct descendant of his decisions, which course he should take.  Are you going to advise him to keep his pet at the expense of the quality of life of all of his great-great-grandchildren?

To me, the answer is obvious.  Maybe not to you.  So when I say that pets are ""forgotten"", it is not just the names or actions of the pets, but also the effects.

Shocking? To you maybe, since that's not what I am ""supposed"" to do, what my genetic material ""has me coded"" to do. Sorry if I spoil it for you, but not all people use square logic in their life like you do.

So, the lack of comprehension, understanding, and awareness is one reason one someone might value a human over an animal, and indeed might value certain humans over other humans, right? So a child with autism shouldn't be as ""valuable"" as the ""normal"" human beings, right? A baby? A senior citizen with Alzheimer's disease? Not as valuable, let's discard them and get normal ones.

The same way tomorrow I will not abandon my child (adopted or not) just because it's not convenient to have him/her right now.

You're willing to argue that someone who works at starbucks ... a job with about 1 week of training... is demonstrably better at their job because of 3 YEARS of study in an unrelated field and the cost to the taxpayer (lets say approx £10k/year/person) is recouped in increased taxes on said person? Because if not, then it would benefit the average taxpayer for said person to not go to uni in the first place.

&gt;I'll bet you didn't know we're the in the top five of manufacturing and it's due to high tech manufacturing.

And where were we before that? I work in engineering, remember? Before things were outsourced, manufacturing was a great fairly low skilled job that morons could do which still produced exportable goods. Now that these have been exported to Asia, this is not the case.

&gt;Hell you don't know anything about the UK manufacturing industry and assume cheap wages boosts a manufacturing sector of a developed economy (Oh so wrong on so many levels).

Expand? Certainly not true in the construction sector.

null,false,ZippyDan,null,null,null,"Well, I didn't ask you what you would do if it was a stranger vs. a family pet; I was asking in the circumstance that it was a stranger human vs. a stranger pet.  That would determine whether you value humans or pets more, all other things being equal.

That said, I still do find your answer ""shocking"".  You seem to think you have the moral high ground, and worry about my happiness, yet I find your definition of happiness to be rather shaky as well.  Even if it is a case of choosing between a stranger human and a family pet, I would still choose the stranger.  That human is someone's son or daughter, possibly someone's father or mother (or future father or mother), and probably has many friends and extended family who value him/her.  The potential societal happiness that would be destroyed by the loss of any one random human individual, far outweighs the personal loss of happiness that I know would be experienced by the loss of a pet.

And yes, I *would* value the life of a fully functioning adult over the life of a senior citizen or someone with severe autism.  The baby is a tougher call, because it theoretically has a chance of living a longer life and creating more happiness and utility than an adult.  That is usually why we choose to save ""children first.  That said, nowhere am I advocating that pets, or Alzheimer's patients, or autistic children, be discarded.  Simply that the value of all things is definitely not equal, and that *if* we are in a situation where we have to choose, a pet is irrelevant next to a human life.  Thankfully, we don't often find ourselves in situations where we have to choose between humans.

As for your idea of commitment, well I would view this as a promise, and a promise is like a contract, and a contract requires mental competency.  Promises made to pets are irrelevant because they have no understanding of commitment.  Commitments made to other humans are completely different because they, generally, understand the difference between loyalty and disloyalty.  A cat or dog might be temporarily sad when you disappear, but they certainly won't have any understanding that you ""haven't kept your word.""

Now, a promise made *to yourself* is an entirely different matter, and I can understand how that then gets into the area of morality and right and wrong, but to that I would say I would never be so silly to promise myself to an animal because I know that life can be unpredictable and I wouldn't want to put myself into a situation where I have to choose between man and beast.

Owning a pet, for me, is a ""best effort"" kind of commitment, and it is certainly a responsibility.  But there are other responsibilities to yourself, to your immediate family, to your friends, and to humanity as a whole that must always supercede the commitment to a pet, if the situation requires it.

Nowhere would I advocate that pets should be discarded when they become inconvenient.  I would say that acquiring a pet requires that you make sure it is well-taken care of for its lifetime, but that does not necessarily mean it need be well-taken care of *by you*.  I think your mistake was in making such an unreasonable commitment from the beginning, knowing the uncertainties of human life.",null,0,null,1424923014,null,0,false,0,coxhai8,null,t3_2wv408,null,t1_coxhai8,null,t1_coxgn96,null,null,null,1427460905,null,-2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,-2,null

Also, I gave you two examples, only one of which involved money.  You conveniently ignored the other one.

But we can still use the ""money"" example.  Sometimes, wealth gets diluted through the generations.  If I start with $100,000, but I have four children who gain my inheritance, then they only get $25,000.  If they each have four children it is only $6,250.  Etc.

Let's say your great-great-grandfather was a well-off middle class man, without a college degree, but with a job good enough to support a pet.  He had an opportunity to go to college and become even wealthier, but he would have to give up his pet.

If he becomes wealthy, then four generations later, you and everyone else in your generation become middle class, also capable of supporting pets.  But if he never takes the college education, every generation after him becomes poorer and poorer until you and your whole family find themselves destitute.

Money can do great evil, but it can also be a force for good.  It is a tool, and as a tool it can represent the ability to take care of and help the people around you, family, and even pets.  Again, the pet has no lasting effect in terms of human life, but human actions can reverberate down the generations in many ways.",null,0,null,1424923493,null,0,false,0,coxhjoe,null,t3_2wv408,null,t1_coxhjoe,null,t1_coxgqbh,null,null,null,1427461024,null,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1,null

Cute.

They get their job by winning votes.

Providing some semblance of continuity over a given time-frame such that long term policies can be implemented and convincing people that they are actually being represented so that they don't bother revolting as this is generally best for everyone.

&gt;Nobody cares, if you can understand it is doesn't matter and the slap down continues. ""Honestly, its because that way you might learn not to let yourself look like a grade A moron. I used to be worse. Now I've learned... people take me more seriously.""

They really do. Try applying to jobs without getting your mum to check you CV for mistakes.

&gt;Any of them, give a shot at the cheap manufacturing one whilst I point at laugh at your explanation.

In construction, cheap labour costs mean that clients spend more on construction. As a brief example, at the moment bricklayers are expensive. Clients and architects are steering away from brick and using other materials if they can. This also means there has been a slow down in construction. Overall, the construction industry slowing down has effects on engineering, architecture, contractors, and labourers. It also affects the import costs of materials, as they are less in demand (except wood which is more in demand because people are shying away from brick). 

The overall outcome is a slowdown: less taxes are taken from the multi-billion pound industry. If, however, more people who would otherwise have gone to a shit uni and done a construction related degree had, instead, done an apprenticeship in bricklaying or another sort of trade (very common in Germany, for example, where they don't have the stigma of being a failure for not going to uni) then we would have cheaper brick layers and wouldn't be essentially outsourcing it to European migrant workers, who (while arguably a benefit to the economy) are less cost effective than home-grown brickies could be. 

This is a niche example, which is supported by discussions with people at my firm and also agreed upon by a plethora of construction industry professionals. I'd be interested to see how you disagree with it.

Personally, I get more benefit from saving my pet. Or, conversely, I would suffer more from allowing my pet to die than from allowing a complete stranger to die. Honestly, it would be easier for me to deal with the emotional aftermath of a stranger's death than the emotional aftermath of my pet's death.

I am not someone who undervalues human life. 

It seems like you're taking a public interest view because you've never fully bonded with an animal the way a lot of people have. This allows you to distance yourself from the animal, so you don't see it as much of a loss to give it up (just like I can distance myself from the stranger in your example). There are millions of people who don't maintain that distance and instead fully attach themselves to their animals, just as they fully attach themselves to their children or siblings or spouses.

- Our current manager was previously our club captain, but after Michael Laudrup was sacked, he took over. He has also been with the club since 2004 when he joined and helped us to promotion from League 2. 

- Michael Laudrup took over as manager when Rogers went to Liverpool . Rogers got us into the premier league and helped us survive the first season. When Laudrup took over, he brought in a lot of players, most notable, Michu and Ki. Michu scored a lot of goals and was the signing of the season at only £2m. We also went on to win the Capital One Cup against Bradford. Michu got injured and was pretty much gone for the entirety of last season. That's when he was loaned to Napoli and is still there. When Laudrup left, most of the Spanish players did too, also Monk sort of cleared them out as they weren't part of his plan. In Monks first game in charge, we won 3-0 over Cardiff who got relegated that season (big rivalry). 

- Bony was our biggest signing ever at £12m and our biggest sale at £28m (I think that's right). Bony was huge for us and scored the most goals in the 2014 year in the BPL (not the most in the season).

- 10 years ago we were out money and almost out of the the lowest professional league. On the last day of the season, a win against Hull kept us in it and then we made the rise to the BPL. Leon Britton actually played that game for us, on loan from West Ham. He's still in the squad today, which is why he is such a significant player to us. Not to mention that he is one of the most accurate passers in the world.

For where you seem to be now, I think you are at a great place to watch Genesis of the Daleks whenever you get the chance. That is a great episode that is very essential to the background of New Who. If you want more, the 2 episodes before that (The Ark in Space and the Sontaran Experiment are also good/relevant to the new show). After you finish season 3, I recommend checking out Terror of the Autons then watching The Deadly Assassin at some point before you get totally caught up. 

Before watching The End of Time specials (I think netflix shoves these in season 4) I recommend checking out The Caves of Androzani but that's not as closely tied as the others I mentioned. I also recommend watching the first episode ever, An Unearthly Child at some point before you get to the season 7 finale/specials. 

If you care about spoilers avoid wiki's like the plague until you get to the end of season 8 and happy watching. I tried to give you some here that I think will enhance your experience of NuWho but there's a lot more great episodes you should check out after you are all caught up.

We need a world class deep lying playmaker to replace him if that's what we want to do.  I think we could essentially put any attacking mid in yayas place and that would essentially be our style.  Even Nasri at mid next to Fernandinho would be better than dinho and Fernando together.  

We could even use somebody small like Omar abdulrahmen who has superb long balls and possession skills in that position.

As far as your question goes there is no right or wrong answer, mainly because of two things, which is positioning and systems. Oscar and KDB play slightly different roles, Oscar plays more defensive and a bit deeper, where KDB likes to play closer to a traditional number 10. If we were playing in a system with a number 10 I would definitely pick De Bruyne.

However, Mourinho doesn't use a system like this ( a system with a true number 10), and because of this I think Oscar would be more useful to us. He acts like a central midfielder at times, covering for others players and putting in a shift in the back. De Bruyne isn't made for that, because like I said he is a number 10. They both provide different elements to a team and slightly different skill sets, so it is really down to what the manager wants and how they play. For example, I can't imagine Mourinho wanting to swap Oscar with De Bruyne right now if he could, and inversely I can't imagine Wolfsburg wanting to swap De Bruyne for Oscar if they could.

This was after the notion of an actual 'TV Tax' collected alongside council tax [as I believe is the system in France] was briefly floated by a few different bodies, before being flatly rejected.~~

~~As someone who hasn't watched live TV for well over five years, I resent the notion of being 'taxed' for an entertainment platform. Having access to live television isn't mandatory; not does it improve peoples lives. Hence why I don't have one. Now admittedly I do use iPlayer and itv player as on-demand platforms to watch content **after** broadcast, but if that were suddenly rolled into the licence fee - i.e access to those services necessitated having a full licence, I'd simply stop and buy those programmes on blu-ray once they were available.~~

~~A few alternate suggestions:~~

~~* Put the live element of iPlayer / itv Player etc. behind a 'pay wall' of sorts, only accessible to folks who've paid for a licence. Either tie it into the licence directly - i.e. enter your licence number and a designated pin, or come up with some other system.~~

~~* One would assume the next iteration / replacement for Freeview is being developed for 2020 and beyond. Include - alongside MP4 compression - encryption, so that it's 'free to air', but only unlockable with a boxset / tv that can authenticate the purchase of a TV licence by the user.~~

~~* [tentative] A reduced licence fee for online only broadcasts. This could work in conjunction with the above idea - offer people the choice to say pay 1/3rd the cost of a full licence, but only to access live programming via the 'net.~~

~~Then there's the oft discussed idea: Make the BBC self-funded; remove the licence fee entirely and move to an advertising supported model.~~

It advises both pedestrians and cyclists to wear high-vis stuff so they can be seen. And it's advice only - there's no legal compulsion (so I'm not sure where you've got this bee in your bonnet from)  
  
It advises cyclists and motorcyclists to wear a helmet because they generally travel at higher velocities than pedestrians and are therefore more likely to suffer head injuries. It doesn't advise drivers to wear a helmet because they are supposed to be strapped into a bloody great lump of metal that protects their entire body on the occasion of a collision.   
  
And it requires both cyclists *and* other road-users (with the exception of pedestrians) to use lights at night so that (a) the road-user can see what's ahead of them; (b) other people can see them coming and take reasonable steps to avoid colliding with them.  
  
None of this has to do with singling anyone out - it has to do with taking reasonable precautions in order to make using the highway as safe as possible without imposing undue restrictions.

However, it is too convenient. Private Eye have been publishing articles about HSBC for about a 5 years on the tax scandal - the latest articles go some way to explaining why this whole thing is so fucked.

Under the last governments evidence was being collected of the huge tax fraud that HSBC was carrying out - it remains to be seen whether Labour would have pressed HMRC on prosecution but they've been quiet about it in opposition so probably not. Since the ConLibs entered government, the Treasury Tax Minister (Con) and HMRC bosses have had the list of accounts, people to be prosecuted, admissions from HSBC bankers themselves (!!) and stacks of 'compelling evidence', HMRC's own words, to be used to prosecute.

In the US, their financial fraud authority went after someone who had joint US citizenship. They got him easily and they had so much evidence they actually labelled the HSBC banker a 'co-conspirator' and said it was one step from money laundering. 

So what did HMRC do? They offered these guys an amnesty. A fucking amnesty - probably for the exact reason you have put and because a lot of the people facing prosecution are powerful and are 'friendlies' and HSBC keep threatening to move out of the UK and their chairman actually works for the Tories in government as trade minister!! No prosecution and a small fine at a fraction of their actual gains from the fraud. They have now offered this amnesty three times because hardly any of the arrogant bastards are taking it. Some have and in the words of Lin Homer, HMRC Chief Executive, it 'removes themselves from prosecution'. 

We all know that rich and powerful people getting away with stuff is nothing new but to take the moral high ground about the internal workings of other countries and their corrupt regimes (China, Russia, India etc.) yet at the same time allow people here to 'remove themselves from prosecution' in the face of overwhelming evidence stinks right to the heart of government.",null,0,null,1424939176,null,0,false,0,coxndou,null,t3_2x642b,null,t1_coxndou,null,t1_coxkcu5,null,null,null,1427463818,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

London would not be my choice of location if I wanted a low-stress life.  It would add more stress than it would remove.  

&gt; So hypothetically, if it were possible, moving to London could be good for my health and could ultimately help me to get out more.

Listen, I really think you have a hopelessly romantic view of the city based on a couple of short visits.  Get out more how?  Transport is expensive.  So you'd be limited to the areas around where you live, which are likely not going to be great.  Unless you can get yourself a bicycle - but if you're too ill to work sometimes, how are you going to be well enough to deal with Kamikaze London Traffic (tm) ?

Council tax, transport, energy costs, rent - all these things are far, far higher in London than they are elsewhere in the country.  Food from delis etc is more expensive.  A night out?  You're going to be paying upwards of three quid for a coke or a fruit juice, and depending where you are that cost could double.

Sure, summer will seem ok, you'll be able to lurk in parks etc - but winter in the city is grim and cold, and if you're in cheap accommodation and prone to getting ill you are going to have a miserable time of it.

I'm not trying to be an arsehole - I understand your desire to get a fresh start somewhere, but I really cannot underline this enough - London eats people up and spits them out.

null,false,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,null,"If you go by the dictionary definition then sure. However I very much hold the view that it's often much more subtle than that. Having seen (and experienced first hand) various stages of discrimination - with no obvious superiority / inferiority being invoked - I would say that racism is manifest in many, many ways, some of which cannot be noticed by casual observation.

Hell, all forms of discrimination should be discouraged, be it race, sexuality, gender or lifestyle choices. The only time any form of exclusion should be enforced is when other people are at any kind of risk. Drugs in the workplace for example are rightfully not allowed, but I would not personally discriminate against someone who took drugs outside of work as long as it didn't interfere with his / her day to day role.

So if we were to take literal definitions of *anything* then the world would be a very unpleasant place. And for that reason, going by a dictionary definition of racism does little or nothing to eliminate racial discrimination in the world.

I find it interesting that in several posts you say you see a black man and think ""a British man"", which conveniently masks any other prejudices you have. But had you been born one or two generations ago would you have thought the same? Would you feel the same if you were born 30 years from now when seeing someone obviously of subcontinental ancestry? And, seeing someone with that background today do you think ""Middle-Eastern"" or ""Muslim"" or both, regardless of religious persuasion or birthplace?

I won't call you out on your beliefs. It's our actions that define us, after all, though it also defines what others think about us. Hell, many people believe I'm a pompous wanker, and they're probably right. I do very often behave like a pompous wanker so that belief is probably justified. So where you come in is this: though I've not seen these videos you've mentioned they are probably watched, liked and passed on by people who are commonly called racist because of their actions and beliefs. Therefore if *you* start posting these videos people, like it or not, will assume that you too feel the same way. They will assume that you take part in white supremacy marches and engage in threatening behaviour towards minorities.

No matter what you believe, that you aren't (by definition) racist, your actions, your posts, will lead many to believe that you are.

Mobile phone coverage can vary a lot in the UK so it's easier if you state where you are moving to so a local person can possibly advise on which network *not* to go with. Some areas are blackspots for certain providers. 

Which plan/provider? Depends what you want. Do you want to download a lot via mobile, or just make lots of phone calls? 

EE and Three are both pretty good, and offer 4G speeds. For £15/month you can get a Three account with unlimited download. That's what I use and I'm in Cambridge.

EE will send you a SIM for free with 50MB of download. You can test the reception in your area.

Landline phone services: they're all about the same, choose the cheapest.  Depends what you want to pay and what speeds you are happy with. e.g. fibre vs ADSL. 

Use http://rightmove.co.uk to find your house/postcode and check the broadband speeds for the area. Their speed checker will show both fibre and adsl speeds.

I get 10Mbps on ADSL, and I'm paying £13/month with EE broadband for my phone line and ADSL. I've not seen cheaper than that.

Landline + broadband + cable TV: shop around. Lots of the providers offer all sorts of special offers all the time.

&gt;

&gt;The __Full Members Cup__ was an [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) cup competition held in [English football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England) from 1985 to 1992. It was also known under its sponsored names of the __[Simod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simod) Cup__ from 1987 to 1989 and the __[Zenith Data Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith_Data_Systems) Cup__ from 1989 to 1992. 

&gt;The competition was created after the 1985 [Heysel Stadium disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium_disaster), when English clubs were banned from [European competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA#Competitions), as an additional competition for clubs in the top two English League divisions.  The competition's name refers to the clubs that were *Full Members* of [the Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_League), with full voting rights; teams from the lower two divisions were *Associate Members* and were only eligible for the [Football League Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Trophy) (then known as the *Associate Members Cup*). The initial Full Members Cup did not include the six teams that had qualified for 1985-86 European competitions, as these played in the English [Super Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Cup_(English_football\)) instead.

&gt;While the European ban of English clubs was partially lifted for 1990-91, and fully lifted for 1991-92, the Full Members Cup survived through the end of 1991-92, its seventh season. The competition was cancelled when the old [Football League First Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division) became the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League).

The thing is, cup football is inherently a luck-based thing, as opposed to the league.  The league's best teams usually rise to the top over the course of a season, overcoming any isolated incidents of bad luck, poor patches of form and short-term injuries.

Cups are much different.  A single poor giveaway goal, bad refereeing decision, sheer dumb luck or hit of the post can make all the difference between progressing or being dumped on your arse.  Considering how patchy our form has been over the last few months, I think it's pretty long odds to think that we'll magically get it together and make it to the final when we can hardly scrape out of a home tie against Fiorentina (or West Ham for that matter) with a draw.

Sacrificing one cup (Europa) to focus on another (COC) may be foolish, especially if we can pumped against Chelsea.

To be honest, we were quite angry - hasn't she learned her lesson yet? We're not going to sell kittens to a home where they are likely to die before their time. I can't remember where I read it, but the average life expectancy of an indoor cat is around 13 years, and it's about 4 years for an outdoor cat. If someone is living on a farm, then we're happy to consider it, but we want our cats to live happy, long lives.

There's a few more minor reasons. Bengals get into places they shouldn't, like garden sheds, and then can't get out. They get lost. They get stolen. Infections are also more common for outdoor cats.

Could be Newmarket/Soham way - Bury SE is a little further out than that. 

OP, where will you be working/studying? If you're working **anywhere** inside the Cambridge city area I absolutely recommend that you consider moving nearer than 25 miles away if your budget will allow you to. I lived in Soham for 6 years and commuted down the A14 every day. It took at least 50 minutes in the morning rush hour and about 35-40 on the way back, which is such a waste of life! If you're able to move somewhere which is only a short commute or bike ride, all the better. 


Again, if it's Newmarket/Soham way, I wouldn't recommend EE. They're my carrier and they're dreadful out in that direction, with lots of dead spots. Again, I speak from experience!

So it's important to differentiate between help from their MP and their MP voicing their opinions in Parliament.

The speaker is allowed to do constituency work for his constituents, so this could be helping them get visas, writing to people on their behalf etc.

However, if his constituency says ""We want you to raise this issue in Parliament"" then no, he can't. 

In reality though, this doesn't really make much difference, an MP who isn't a senior party political figure has little hope of influencing party policy anyway. If you get a backbench MP to raise an issue in Parliament, in reality they will probably do it in a debate with only a handful of people present, or they will formally ask a minister during minister's questions (also with a handful of people present, but more than for a debate). It won't really achieve much.

So hypothetically yes, the speaker does rob his constituency of their ""vote"" in Parliament, but seeing as it makes little to no difference in practice it seems like a non-issue.

The bigger issue is that since other major parties don't stand against them, the constituents don't have a choice to not have the speaker as their MP. Again, you can argue that since to be speaker you realistically need to be an experienced MP which usually means you're already in a safe seat, but if the other major parties don't even attempt to stand if the seat became ""unsafe"" it wouldn't make a difference as he's already almost gaurenteed victory every time.

Still £40 might be very competitive compared to carpet cleaning companies, I don't know.

If you do use it be prepared to be grossed out as to how much animal hair comes out of the carpets! We had a flat with cream carpets and a cat with black hair. I hoovered every 3 days or so and the carpets looked immaculate.

However since we weren't really meant to have a cat in the flat, when we moved out I decided to hire a carpet cleaning machine. It pulled huge balls of black cat hair out of this already clean looking carpet. I had to keep stopping it to clear it all out.

The end results were awesome though.

The town was founded by a Viking called Grim and 'by' is Norse/Danish for village so it's a contraction of the Danish for Grim's Village.

A very quick Google turn's up the 'Ugly Town' story, but it's all 'a Danish mate says....' rather than an actual source.  Google Translate gives 'Ugly Town' as 'Grimme By' in modern Danish though.

Edit:  Just came across a Dane in [another sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/2x6npx/you_know_what_i_got_a_five_minutes_until_my_crew/coxosfu) and posed the question, here's his reply:

&gt;Almost but not quite.

&gt;Grim means ugly in Danish, and by means town or village (sidenote: all towns in England that end with by do so because they were founded by danish settlers/vikings - we did more than just rape and pillage), but the s changes the meaning to the village of the Grims.

&gt;You can also be named Grim as a surname - even in Danish, although you will probably get teased in school.
Grimby would have meant Uglytown, but Grimsby means Grims Town.",null,0,null,1424945633,null,0,1424948773,0,coxoqhc,null,t3_2x7kf4,null,t1_coxoqhc,null,t1_coxo5zp,null,null,null,1427464451,null,18,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,18,null

So let me get this straight. There is some sort of natural bias against women in modern society that mysteriously prevents them from achieving the same success as men.

However the percentage of [women in Universities](http://www.theguardian.com/education/datablog/2013/jan/29/how-many-men-and-women-are-studying-at-my-university) is significantly greater than that of men.

null,false,thatcambridgebird,null,null,null,"&gt; Try to visit at least one of the University colleges as these are central to the what the city is. You can get a punt (riverboat) tour which will take you down the college backs and give you a bit of history.

Have a go at hiring a punt yourself if there's a few of you visiting. It's so much more fun and you'll have a great time. You can also stop off at a local supermarket and pick up some beers or wine and snacks to take on the punt with you, if that's your thing and the weather is nice enough to warrant a boating picnic. 

Restarants: off the top of my head...for a typical 'touristy' view try The Chop House on Kings Parade, which is directly opposite King's College, so you get a nice view while you eat. That's at the pricier end of the spectrum - £20+ per head for mains, not including drinks etc. It's very meat-centric and its selling point is the locally reared beef/pork etc which is served in the restaurant. 


One of my favourite budget places to eat is Little Seoul, a Korean place on Regent Street. It's down a set of stairs next door to another restaurant so you could walk past it and never know it's there. It's delicious in there and the food is reasonably priced at around £7-8 for a main course.  

To get around, you could think about hiring a bike. However, please don't cycle on the pavements (unless it's a marked path for bikes too), in a huge group down the middle of the road, and please ask the bike hire place to give you lights if you're going to be cycling in the dark!

null,false,joethepro36,null,null,null,"Well I'm a firm believer in free speech and the idea that to actually experience life you must try and experience as many things as possible. In political terms this means being open to many points of view, seeing the arguments of all kinds of people. When it came to the video in question, I found it to be well researched, reasonable and with good production values. It had little bias, just stating the facts of the matter. However the mods saw the title and pulled the video in a heartbeat. It really showed me the mentality behind the left these days. If something falls outside of your worldview, just pull it down or avoid it entirely. I don't like seeing all the pro-immigration stuff everywhere or the endless amount of poorly thought out left-wing opinion that is often touted as fact since upvotes determine who's right, who's wrong. Still I accept such things because the plurality of opinions and political thought is more important. Sometimes you need to see or hear something outside of your usual views just to shake things up a bit.

How can I possibly believe that posting such things is not racist? Well for one, reverse the ethnicity posted and it would be perfectly fine. Funny that. Then people will tell me ""oh they're oppressed minorities"". That's also kind of funny given that whites make up less than 20% of world population, blacks are slightly less but not by much and Asians are about 60%. Going by worldwide trends, whites are in the minority. Is that bad? Not at all. The problems arise when you look at demographic trends of birth rates in white countries where its plummeted rapidly. Combine that with massive immigration and in a hundred years or so whites will be in the minority. Now people tell me here why does it matter if someone has a different skin colour? Well it doesn't, its not about colour. With immigration comes cultures and differing beliefs. You'll find ethnicity and culture are quite linked if the immigrants do not assimilate to the native culture. When you have a majority of the population being from other parts of the world, the tyranny of the majority kicks in. This is my fear here that democratic process will be undone by immigrants who do not assimilate *and* displace the native population. Maybe I'm just fearful but I think it wise to prepare for the future and to see where you are headed before you get there. I really don't want to get to old age to be that reactionary saying to my kids after they ask me why the country isn't majority white ""I told ya so, back in my day all the other kids were saying this couldn't happen"".

I really wouldn't even argue with it if people weren't so hypocritical and self-hating. I just really cannot stand the left right now. Anything that impacts whites in a negative way is practically celebrated whereas anything good for any other ethnicity is championed in this weird race doesn't exist for whites but does for other ethnicities. I just don't understand this double-think. It's stuff like this that pushed me away from the left. It stopped being about economics, the working man and helping out people at the bottom and has changed into a crying match over who's more victimised.

null,false,miomike,null,null,null,"I've pondered this a fair bit. The problem with me pondering it is I don't have a great knowledge of European football at present, so I can't name the exact player I'd like us to have.  

I can say that I'd not like to just get any old striker. We've got Pelle, we've got Long, we may have Rodriguez again eventually. What we need is the next step up. Rodriguez may have been on course to perhaps being a top level striker before injury, but now we don't know. He is (or was) the exact type of striker I'd have liked though, or like to see us get in.  

We've had the ""big man"" up front for a long time now. I'll not do Lambert or Pelle the injustice of not qualifying that statement with the fact that neither are simply a big guy to loft the ball to, both have good build up play and good finishing (when in form!). But I really think we need a more all-round striker (with some actual pace!). I'm pretty sure Rodriguez fits that bill, or at least could do.  

But, as Rodriguez is such an unknown quantity these days, I honestly have no idea. I'm not sure there are any in the PL that are necessarily a perfect fit for us. Ings might do well, not sure if his all-round game is up to scratch yet, but he's young so might be able to take it all on. Someone like Berahino I wouldn't really want, he's coming across as a typical spoilt footballer at present, and I feel like he'd maybe want more than Saints (undeservedly so). Not sure there are many others floating around that would a) be an upgrade, b) fit with our style and c) come to us.  

That'd leave some European option. But sadly I don't know many of the strikers that aren't already at top clubs and therefore would not be too likely to come to us.  

Had the conversation on reddit somewhere or another before and people linked a few, but I don't remember them and none of the jumped out at me as names I knew so could be excited about signing. Guess we'll have to wait and see.  

Goddamn Rodriguez and his injury.

I'm not in the Police. But I count enough retired and current Police in my Family and close friends to have a reasonable view into their world.

&gt; I think the options are not a binary.

Of course they're not. No one ever said they were. Every situation is unique. The officer has to make a judgement based on the prevailing circumstances of whether the subject is armed, whether they intend harm to themselves or to others (and whether they have the means to carry that out), along with exacerbating factors.

That then informs their decision to draw a baton, unholster their taser, bring the taser from a down-position to the aim, or ultimately to deploy it.

If you've got someone cornered, you can afford to stand and talk to them. If there's a casualty in play, then the subject's welfare is now a secondary consideration. So they're a child? Tough shit, they're over 10 - they know stabbing someone is against the law. You need to secure the situation so the paramedics can move in.

That's why, of 400 incidents where tasers were drawn, they were NOT used in 367 cases.

Put it that way. In hundreds of thousands of incidents, tasers were not drawn. Of the 400 where they were, they weren't actually fired in 367/400 cases.

367/400 doesn't sound to me like the Police are using them as anything other than a last resort.

And as I say, in some cases you have Borough Support piling in in riot gear and basically pinning the subject under their shields (which isn't a whole lot better than deploying a taser. You're certainly coming out with bruises and scrapes after that).

Operating systems for a long time now have been clever enough in how they load their binaries as to not actually re-load it.  As a result people often complain that they've got two or more processes that are using a lot of memory, when in fact they are not, they are sharing the common data.  Most operating systems also get sneaky, because in legacy world devs didn't mark something as immutable, even something which people assumed would be, some sneaky guy would mutate it, so the OS has to out sneaky that guy, by creating a new copy as soon as they make that change, however, the OS will only do that with a small segment of that data, the size of which is going to be based on an efficient page of data that a CPU can optimise for.

you can actually determine passwords and PC input purely from an audio recording in close proximity (a few metres) to your CPU by reverse engineering the acoustic signature of processes.

you can also reconstruct monitor screens by the electromagnetic inductance/interference from a phone in proximity to the monitor cable.

i.e over time i could see what was on your pc screen despite no internet access just through a phone call in close proximity (like an office phone on the desk)

Also any audio recording made in the UK inside a typical building like an office can be timestamped.

so for example say you take an old 80's style tape recorder into work and sit at your desk after everyone has left so its completely silent and no audio clues about where you are etc and you make an audio recording they can immediately determine the exact second you started and stopped that recording.

alternatively if you edited a recording in two parts (or more) no matter how good you were or how seamless it appeared they can tell its edited and tell you exactly when they were recorded.

Thank you.

&gt; I have no....Talent favours men.. I see.. well that's enlightened me.

I'm sure you wouldn't have entered into a debate on differences between the sexes without understanding that women's distribution along the Bell Curve tends to be statistically more centralised, whereas men's distribution statistically tends to be more spread. This is the reason that there are so many more male criminals, just as there are so many more male geniuses. It also means that at the top sphere in any endeavour there should statistically be significantly more men than women if a meritocratic system is used.

&gt; Drive is a masculine trait..

Drive is certainly a masculine trait but it is NOT an exclusively masculine trait, it is just that men have drives to succeed in the workplace that women don't. Success in the workplace brings far more benefits to men than it does to women irrespective of career advancment. Men and women can both have drives to succeed, but men have more drives to succeed because of the additional benefits they get from doing so. Women are attracted to men because they achieve high earnings, whereas men are not attracted to women because they achieve high earnings, for example. Similarly men's self image is more attuned to their career success, and they are more likely to be judged according to it.

&gt; As to how old I am, old enough to have been going to pubs when there were still Stag Rooms where women weren't allowed.

Then you've had more than ample time to research both sides of the issue and really no excuse not to.

&gt; I'm [sure](http://sports.westway.org/because-all-women-are-worth-it) there [must](http://www.thesorority.org/club.asp) be a word to describe a [situation](http://www.swimming.org/go/get-started/women-only-swimming/) where a [class](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/women-only-train-carriages-could-introduced-4349573) of people is [barred](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/student-funding/financial-support/trusts/female-students/society-training-women) from doing [something](http://girlsleadership.org/girls-leaderships-girl-meets-world-professional-development-training-rachel-simmons/) but for the [life](http://thebeautylodgelondon.co.uk/) of me I can't [remember](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/bbc-has-greater-responsibility-than-other-broadcasters-to-recruit-women-in-news-and-current-affairs-report-says-9980042.html) it... it's on the tip of my [tongue](http://www.lwn.org.uk/all_women_shortlists)...

I'm sure you'll recall it soon.

&gt; So let me get this straight. There is some sort of natural bias against women in modern society that mysteriously prevents them from achieving the same success as men.

No, there is no natural bias, just different preparedness between men and women to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve success.

&gt; However the percentage of women in Universities is significantly greater than that of men. 

Ah, the benefits of switching to more female friendly teaching methods. By all means, please do research why this is the case.

&gt; Or maybe my role as a parent should be more discouraging so she realises that society is skewed against any possibility of her really succeeding in her chosen career path, and that perhaps the best strategy should be for her to latch on to an alpha male to provide for her future needs.

I'm sure that both yourself and society have already (whether inadvertently or not) [imparted the latter](http://www.businessinsider.com/princeton-women-husbands-princetonian-2013-3?IR=T), but even mentioning the former reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of both my side of the argument and the status quo. You don't discourage an individual from striving for their dreams because of their sex unless you are a sexist. You do however understand that the reason that so many people of both sexes don't reach the very top is because of the massive sacrifices necessary to do so and that society expects men to have to make these sacrifices but not women.

there is delight in and satisfaction upon taking action to restore what you see as a significant wrong.

Hand on heart if I was ever tortured by someone or attempted to be tortured like in the film ""hostel"" and i managed to get free etc, i would genuinely delight in hurting them back as painfully as possible (torturing a torturer).

its no different from taking satisfaction from punching a bully who goes around punching people for no reason. its just higher stakes but the same principle, restoring what you see as major injustice an the will of inflicting suffering onto those that believe they can inflict it on innocent people.

This is why the PM used to have to answer that question repeatedly until Parliamentary convention changed so it was assumed that everyone asked the same thing, and he only needed to give the answer once.

You can still submit a different question for PMQs, and in fact I watched once as a member was called and he had submitted an entirely different question (which surprised everyone), so the PM answered that, and then the follow up.

  **The interesting background bit:** 
  
 There's a company called Richer Sounds.  
  
  Owned by a guy called Julian, 100%.  
  
  He also founded a company called Audio Partnership which he owns 51% of.  
 
  Audio Partnership buy Cambridge Audio.  
  
  Richer Sounds, owned by Julian are the only place in the UK to buy Cambridge Products, so this guy has a load of stores where he exclusively sells a brand that he also (mostly) owns. They also happen to own Mordaunt, which RS also like to push people to buy.  
  
 Staff actively encouraged to sell CA/M products for obvious reasons. Therefore, the customer is given hyped options for products that all the staff are really excited about, because they are of course very happy to sell them at a decent sized mark up, seeing as the parent company are sold them at a pretty low unit cost where the profit is made buy the same buy regardless.  
   
  **The bottom line, however:**
    
  All of the things above removed, CA actually sell some really good decent products for the price point, and are generally quite well regarded, and generally sold by staff who know what they are talking about because they have a direct line to the parent company who can tell them everything they need to know about the product.

Free speech is all, of course. It’s what the West prides itself upon. And I do see the inherent paradox of “stand up for free speech but don’t offend people.” Of course, that conflict is very much something that causes a great deal of turmoil for me. I don’t like people to be offended or upset by what I have to say, or by what anyone else says for that matter. Yet freedom of speech is very much about being able to say whatever you like regardless of what others feel.

Surely the only way for this paradox to be resolved is for everyone to accept free speech, and understand that this is exactly what it is without being offended themselves. Which is nigh-on impossible, of course. If some random internet stranger attacks my world view I ought to accept it, at least until it becomes a personal attack. But this sub is prone to forgetting that, and /r/ukpolitics has ignored it for ages.

So where does this leave us? Well, I wholeheartedly disagree with your opinion but I understand it. I certainly appreciate that there are concerns throughout societies that certain cultures may overwhelm others. I am well aware that group A wants their own way of life and worries that group B may squash it in group B’s own quest for *their* way of life, yeah. I get it. But I don’t necessarily think we need to be overly concerned by this state of affairs.

Now I understand why the left is reviled by the right, and vice versa. I certainly understand where you’re coming from, given the thought and coherence that you put into your reply. On another day I might even agree with some of your points, especially those in the last paragraph. And here’s where I differ from the “traditional” left: cultures rise, cultures fall. One culture need not be championed by another (in the way the trad. Left appear to do), and while I don’t like the thought of one culture destroying another, I’m enough of a realist to know that it happens. It has happened since civilisation began, and will continue to do so. It wouldn’t be right for me to take sides because I would most likely be wrong.

This doesn’t make me some enlightened guru, far from it. I’m just an old, fat bastard with a passing interest in the world around me and its history. I know that our own culture has plenty of flaws, more than enough for me to think that we have no right to preserve it in favour of another. But I’m also aware of the flip side: why should we allow, I dunno, a bunch of Afghanis to set up their own little Kabul / cabal (ho ho!) in the outskirts of Coventry or wherever? Why can’t they adapt? Sure they could, and probably should. But then I feel that bringing different people and cultures together has frequently ended up with some of humanity’s greatest advances, despite the pain that some clashes have caused.

Anyway, bringing it back down to earth: in recent days I have felt fully supportive of you, as you have been for the most part expressing your opinions in a clear, polite manner only to have a large boot placed upon you. I say again, I don’t agree with your world view, but that’s just me. But it is fair to let you have your say, and fair to let you say it without fear of an aggressive rebuttal. The reactions that you have received are, IMHO, mostly undeserved and I think many other people would have buggered off long before now. So thank you for carrying on as well, especially given the dignified responses you have made. And given some of the responses you’ve received your view of the left is actually fully justified.

Right, I’ve prattled on long enough. I’ll love ya and leave ya, though I will make one final wry observation: it’s quite amusing to think that the ideas of a champion of the left (Orwell) once used to attack the right are now being associated with the deeds of the left.

null,false,Hemmers,null,null,null,"&gt; it makes me much less likely to believe that there is a need to taser children.

There is no need to taser anyone. Unless they pose a threat to life. In that incidence, their status as a child, adult, or indeed vulnerable adult is of no relevance. Te question is ""Are they going to hurt someone?""

If the answer is yes, then regardless of their age or status, they must be rendered harmless.

&gt; And I still maintain that threatening people with weapons is not a great way of de-escalating a dangerous scenario.

Sometimes you don't get a choice.

If you want to talk down a paranoid schizophrenic who is convinced everyone is out to get them and is in a position to harm an innocent person then by all means, try to talk them down. But if they make a move against the innocent party, are you planning to carry on talking whilst they murder an innocent individual, or are you going to intervene?

Sure, in many cases the ""You don't want to do this, you've done nothing that can't be undone. Yet."" line works. Maybe even the majority of cases. And that is absolutely where the Police start - and in most cases it's where it ends, with a hands-on arrest or the subject surrendering.

In a minority of cases, the subjects themselves force you to take direct action, and I don't see why anyone would object to that direct action when it's necessary. If you can't imagine a scenario where it would be appropriate to deploy a taser, then you obviously haven't spent very much time looking at the subject.


Discharging a taser is only a step away from discharging a firearm. There's a whole chain or scrutiny that they go through, just as all Police shootings go through an IPCC inquiry.

It's actually a hell of a lot *more* accountable than using a baton (of which there is no paper trail - only the Officer's and witness's statements. There's no evidence of a baton's use - unlike a taser where you have to go and sign for a new cartridge).",null,0,null,1424953722,null,0,1424953938,0,coxqgh2,null,t3_2x39lc,null,t1_coxqgh2,null,t1_coxq827,null,null,null,1427465254,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

This is kind of the thing with hindsight though, you could always argue that we should have bought Villa, Moutinho and Hulk, but the aforementioned two could all easily have flopped just as hard as Soldado and Paulinho and who knows if Hulk had been an upgrade on what we've seen from Lamela so far. Valencia's Soldado, Confed Cup's bronze boot winner Paulinho and Roma's Lamela were all very highly touted at the time. Add on the fact that none of Villa, Moutinho or Hulk have played in the PL since and it's impossible to guess what would have happened.

Given where we are situated now and where we are headed, it is however possible to compare our current situation and trajectory under Poch to the one under AVB at the time. AVB seemed to not value youth development as much as the managers that have replaced him, and our current model of promoting youth to the first team is paying dividends and seems to be a much more sustainable long term plan. It might have actually been for the best to have the Bale spending yield mixed results in order for it to facilite the demise of AVB/Baldini.

Not much between Hangeland and Delaney either in my opinion.

Zaha, Bolasie, and Punch all viable on the wings, I don't think we should keep playing Gayle there however. He strays into the middle too much leaving his full back exposed and just looks a bit out of position (which he is) in general.

I think against the more physical teams we need a target man near the front, Muzza up top or in the hole, Chamakh same. McArthur or Ledley could also play that cham role, Punch didn't look bad there either.

Perhaps something like this vs West Ham:

             Speroni
    Ward Dann Hangeland Souare
         Jedinak McArthur
     Puncheon Chamakh Bolasie
              Murray

    Subs: Hennessey, Ledley, Gayle, Zaha, Delaney

Would hope not to need Hennessey or Delaney, and use Gayle and Zaha later on to take advantage of tired legs. Ledley can come on for Chamakh when he gets injured.

Souare has been disappointing so far but I really think he has more to offer than we've seen, would like to see him get a chance to show it.

The bench is mostly interchangeable with various starting positions too, and I prefer Gayle starting but I think Muzza will do better against West Ham.

I don't watch TV (but I do watch iPlayer and torrent stuff).

I don't want to pay for [insert tv program I don't like].

The BBC is completely useless because of [insert tv program I don't like]. Even the fact that they make that program that I don't like shows how completely crap they are, even though it probably sells well outside the UK and pays for its self.

I never use any BBC services (but I do read the BBC news and I prefer to ignore that their high quality of programming forces other broadcasters to actually put some effort into quality entertainment to compete).

It should be advert subsidized (even though I always time delay skip adverts or torrent).

Private companies should be involved (even though Sky makes sure we can't see any sport unless we're willing to pay 1.5x the whole license fee just for access to the sports channels and will do literally anything to maintain their stranglehold).

Oh, I forgot, they do make one programme I really like. Actually, there's two, no three but I'd wait for them to come out on Blu-Ray (no I wouldn't, I'd just torrent them).

I once saw a report on the BBC that seemed a bit biased. Also, I hear Rupert Murdoch saying the BBC biased and that guy knows his shit. In fact, if Rupert Murdoch sorted our news channels for us it would be much less biased - like Fox News. Also, there's also literally no way to make sure the BBC isn't totally biased by the Government.

I haven't grasped the fact that paying individually could actually cost substantially more since the license is per household for as may TVs as you like.

Dude. There are 120,000 plus officers in the UK. I can claim to know 6 of them, and can tell you that making a broad, generic statement like that about them marks you out as clueless. 

But also, how often do you actually hear about police brutality or serious incidents?

Couple a year? 10? 100? Show me a town of 120k people that has less than 100 crimes/yr. In any community there will be bad apples, even pre-vetted ones.

Moreover, 37 kids getting tasered sounds quite serious. 400 drawn tasers in a year? Wow that's a lot. Isn't it?

37 child-taserings in a year means that of those 120,000 officers, *one* of them fired a taser *once every 10 days*.

Well done to your mum for talking someone down. Guess what, that's what 120,000 officers do *every single day*.

And once every 10 days, one of them gets the shit call when one of the 60million people in the UK is going so mental that they can't be talked to and needs to be forcibly apprehended. And the other 119,999 officers manage to deal with their subject without using a taser.

What angers me is that instead of doing this, Tory members of the government are going around panicked that they didn't keep a pledge (A PLEDGE, not an aspiration) that they should never have made in the first place. Migration is unequivocally a good thing for Britain, for our economy, and for British people, it creates more jobs and they pay more tax than they take back in benefits. The Tories are senselessly chasing a populist vote that says exactly the opposite, that ""they take our jobs"", they ""they come here to scrounge"". It's just not true, and it reinforces the populist narrative and creates the social discord that many white working class people buy into. Instead of leading the debate and seeking to overthrow these lazy and incorrect ideas, they run along with them no matter how dumb they look doing it or how much political capital they stand to lose in the long term because ultimately they can't control the level of inward migration, whether from within or outwith the EU.

Barry is back and available for selection so he will certainly figure in the starting line up in which ever position he wants. Sitting in front of the defence and playing sideways passes seems to be the least physically taxing position possible so I imagine he will hang around there again. Expect him to allow opposition players to jog past him with the ball whilst he attempts to foul them.

Besic will start next to Barry but Martinez will sub him after 15 minutes so he can run to the Gwladys, cup his ear like a celebrating Hulk Hogan and take in the boos. Naismith and Barkley aren't wingers so I expect at least one of them to feature out wide. 

In terms of tactics, Martinez is determined to prove that it's possible to do the exact same thing over and over again and attain different results so I expect us to set up exactly the same way we have for the past 30 odd games despite poor performances and results.

You assume too much. You aren't looking at the facts of the situation but rather making assumptions and therefore prejuducing your opinion on the man and the situation.

I have two very similiar experiences, though not involving the police, where a court judgement was made without my knowledge. So yes I can very well believe he wasn't aware of it.

Case one, my car was towed by bailiffs and I got a bill for £1200. It took two weeks before the council realised they had made a mistake and had the court order struct off and my car returned. I had paid the £50 parking fine 5 months prior but they processed it through the court anyway. I didn't have any knowledge of this until two arseholes knocked on my door asking for a large sum of money.

Case two, someon managed to secure a county court judgement without me having any knowledge of the matter or having any ability to contest it. First I heard of it was when I got a credit alert that my credit file had changed due to the application of a CCJ.

Took about 3  months to sort that out, eventually got a court date rescheduled, drove 300 miles to represent myself before the judge agreed in my favour and I even got my costs paid for.

null,false,thatcambridgebird,null,null,null,"&gt; Housing is as expensive as London. Rents are 1100+ GPB for a tiny 2 bedroom terraced house in the city. These houses were originally built for railway workers so you get the idea of how cramped they are.

But you don't have to live directly in the city centre. Cambridge has very good transport links in terms of local rail, bike networks, buses, the guided busway to name just a few. I live in a 3 bedroom semi about 4 miles from Cambridge and have the option to cycle every day or get the train if my bike's off the road. I agree, though, some of the one-bed cupboards I've seen for rent around £1k per month are just horrible for the money. 


&gt; Housing shortage and high prices lead to majority of people working in Cambridge to commute in. There's no integrated transport system so the roads are all gridlocked in and out of the city.


Congestion is dreadful, I will agree with you on that one. It's not so much about an 'integrated' system though, and more about a poor road planning network. 


&gt; The railway is a total joke. It's completely over subscribed and over priced.


Welcome to the UK. This is not Cambridge-specific news. 

&gt; It's not a very healthy city to live in either. There aren't many green spaces available to the public, don't be fooled by the collage greens, they are private. There are only 2 25 meter swimming pools, again completely over subscribed. No ice rinks! no thermal baths, 2 small cinemas, no decent music venues.


I can only agree with what others have said. There's a *shit* ton of green spaces, it's a lovely city to be in all year round. I've no idea what you're expecting in terms of the swimming pool situation - if they're popular for public swimming, I fail to see how that's a problem. I'd be more concerned if public amenities were being closed from under-use. There's a campaign to get an ice rink to the area, so hold your horses on that one. Complaining that there are no thermal baths is just plain bonkers, so i'll skip over that one. It's like moaning that there's no local theme park, or go-kart track round Parker's Piece, or something. The city wasn't built to cater to your personal tastes! Cinemas and music venues have been covered by others. 


&gt; Lots of historical cities in Europe have decent integrated transport links so there's no excuse.

Cambridge is not pitched as a tourist town, though. It's a university city which happens to attract a large number of sightseers because of that fact.


&gt; Oh the other most important thing is the University of Cambridge doesn't pay a Cambridge living allowance even though everything in the city costs as much as London. So most other businesses also do not pay for a Cambridge living allowance hence people can not afford to live in Cambridge.

How is this a 'most important thing' ? Again, it seems like this has got your goat because presumably you work for the university and are irked that there's no cost of living allowance? As I've said elsewhere, there's plenty of other very local villages within an easy bike ride of the centre to move to, if you're concerned about rental costs. Everything definitely does not cost as much as London - a Friday night out in Cambridge doesn't cost me upwards of £60-odd quid which I've spent in the capital. 

&gt; Such a mess!

I suspect you're new to the area, have ended up living somewhere like the new developments round the station which is why you haven't seen much greenery, haven't explored much and just haven't found your feet yet. 

If it turns out you were born and bred here, then what the hell? Have you been living under a rock?!

But it's also worth noting that in the latest figures the larger increase was from outside the EU. Net migration from inside the EU was up 32,000 while net migration from outside was up 52,000.

Looking very briefly at the graph it seems that the gross immigration is only now just getting above 2010 levels, with the suggestion from the academics (who unlike politicians may not have as much of an agenda) that this relates to the improving economy rather than any changes in migration policy.

As for the £18,600 figure, based on [this data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/percentile-points-from-1-to-99-for-total-income-before-and-after-tax) 42% of people have an income less than that before tax, down from 60% ten years ago.

Based on [this data](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/376801/Income_tax_receipts_statistics_July_2014_bulletin_141119.pdf) the total income tax collected in 2013-14 was £154bn, or with a population of 64 million, around £2,400 per person, or an average income of £21,440 based on 2013-14 tax rates.

Are you actually serious?

There are 120,000 Police officers in the UK - how many cases of brutality or misconduct do you hear about a year? The evidence that they are maintaining their scrupulous standards is that misconduct is sufficiently rare that when it does happen it's a *really big deal*.

&gt; Which for me represents a series of failures.

But few, if any of them by the Police.

They've been called in when Child Services or the parents or whoever have lost control of the situation. You have to remember that they're *already coming in at the bottom*. They're containing the damage, providing backup when talking is on the cusp of failure and the situation is already dire - *they're dealing with people at their worst*.

You don't seem to understand the role of the Police.

When the courts, child services, schools, foster parents, whatever have fucked up - when they have failed a child so completely that they've picked up a knife and stabbed their teacher, THAT is when the Police get called in, and if they are forced to go hard-tactical to bring that situation to a close and stop anyone else being hurt or killed, then that's *not* a failure.

When they get called to a domestic, or an assault, they're dealing with a crisis situation. You can't criticise the Police for having to use strong tactics if they're dealing with someone else's series of failures.

*They're not responsible for the long-term well-being of that child*. They're responsible for closing out the current crisis, ideally with everybody coming out safe and unharmed.

You seem to be taking all the failings of Child Services, YOIs and our Criminal Justice System in general - all the people *actually* responsible for child welfare, and blaming all their failings on the fact that the people at the bottom of the pile, mopping up the worst incidents, very occasionally choose to use a taser instead of breaking someone's arm with a baton.

They wished to move back to the UK, and he was able to secure a job (with a salary substantially above this threshold), but they were refused a settlement visa for him as a spouse, as she could not prove that she would be able to support the family herself.  This meant that my sister was effectively asked to chose between living in her country of citizenship, or living with her husband.  

When I wrote to my (cons) MP, his response was ""yes, this is wrong, but I don't care""' when I wrote to the Home Office, the response was ""fuck off"".

Both products I would keep away from the rosacea, unless your doctor advises you otherwise.

Retinaldehyde is also useful in acne but it's practically impossible to find products here with that active unfortunately. That and retinol can both be used on rosacea if your skin tolerates that.

It is fine to use a lot of products if they all add something to your regime, don't add piles of unnecessary ingredients like fragrance, fits in with your lifestyle and keeps your skin calm and healthy. Lots of is into Asian beauty have quite long routines. Having said that you might not need several new products, a prescription retinoid might do the trick.

More potent glycolic products are photosensitising for up to a week after ceasing use, so morning or night application is not that relevant.

&gt;Jimmy Savile’s former PA last night branded the disgraced TV star a manipulative bully who was sly enough to cover his tracks during his sick campaign of abuse against young girls.

&gt;The 70-year-old spent 32 years as Mrs Fix-it to Savile, becoming one of his closest confidantes.

&gt; Janet initially stuck by him when the allegations of his perverted past surfaced. But as the trickle turned to a torrent, she conceded that even she may have been duped.

&gt;""He was a very, very clever man and if he could keep something like that covered up he was even more clever than I gave him credit for.""

Excerpt from the report:

&gt; He would put Victim 13 across his knee, pull down his trousers
and underpants, “grope his backside” and spank him. This happened on about 10 occasions. Savile always told him not to tell his parents. Victim 13 reported that on one occasion Savile’s Secretary Janet Cope (née Rowe) walked into the Porters’ Lodge and found him assaulting Victim 13. She just turned around and walked out. 

&gt;Victim 20: Twenty years following the attack (in 1997), she wrote to Savile’s Secretary, Janet Cope, (née Rowe) explaining what had happened to her. When she got no reply she wrote again. She never got a response. 

So much for her innocence.

I dont think many people realise how fucked up war actually is, this isn't Call of Duty where you can Rambo your way through with just a few scratches to show for it. These guys will literally cut your head off or burn you alive.

Whilst a bunch of IS are from the West and other countries, a significant amount of them from the wartorn Middle East and the horrors that they are committing now aren't much different to the shit they've had to deal with themselves. They kill and torture without any emotion because its almost the norm for them.

Whilst its important to fight this barbarity its not the job of ill equipped Brits that have nothing to do with the politics behind the fight to get involved. Our government has just come out of two wars that weren't exactly a huge success so I can see their reluctance to get involved.

This is also a point for the Muslims of the West that are getting involved (usually second or third generation immigrants), they too don't have any idea about the reality of war, they've been raised on a steady diet of PlayStation and Action Films so everything seems cool and badass for them too.

Even then it is all relative. If it was a slave revolution which was organised by slaves used as teachers or something, the point still remains. The masses generally can't organise a proper successful revolution with direction from the educated classes (which is usually the middle class).

Yes, to win the Europa League we would need favorable results in 8 more games, starting with tonight...but I think the payoff is worth the investment.  Further, qualification of a Champions League spot through a top 4 finish is most likely a bridge too far for us this year (as much as I don't want to admit it) but I think we should be concentrated on building squad chemistry (and retaining key players...e.g. Kane Lloris, etc.) for the future (next season) anyway.  

That said, this would be my game plan...to start: 

Lloris

Dier-Fazio-Vertonghen-Davies 

Bentaleb-Strambouli

Eriksen-Dembele-Lamela

Soldado

We should start somewhat defensively keeping compact when in possession and not pressing too high when out, being patient when on the ball and not ""killing"" ourselves to win the tie in the first 5 minutes.  Further, the defensive presence of Strambouli and Bentaleb will need to limit their central midfielders time on the ball.  After the first 15, we should test Fiorentina's fullbacks, running at them whenever possible, if nothing else just to wear them down a bit.  I believe we will get our goal(s) (scored in 10 straight...16 out of last 17)...the question is when.  If we are still in need of a goal after halftime, we have Walker and Townsend fresh on the bench (to further attack the fullbacks) and I would like a double substitution sacrificing Fazio (push Dier over) and Strambouli (Push Dembele back, Eriksen over).  Then obviously as a last resort we have our ""get in son"" Kane...either in a straight swap for Soldado or pulling off Dembele to go with 2 strikers, and one holding mid.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"A spray is not a moisturiser, and watery products alone do not hydrate skin for any length of time. You need occlusives/ lipids and./ or the major emollients (fatty alcohols/ cationic sirfactants) to help your skin hold more water.
 
A strong skin barrier (keeps water in) start with diet and lifestyle choices: up to four servings of oily fish a week, whole eggs, seeds like pumpkin and chia to supply a variety of lipids. Also plenty of mineral rich foods (beans, lentils, seeds again).

When you have the right fats and minerals look at your water intake from wholefoods, low sugar fruits and non starchy vegetables are especially rich - many countries now advocate seven to nine servings a day, we are way behind with *at least* five a day. If you are eating right you don't need gallons of water, that will just make you go to the toilet all the time and possibly flush out minerals/ electrolytes that help your body hold water.

Skincare wise a strong barrier begins with your cleanser and exfoliant, if these are damaging the barrier then basically they are fighting your moisturisers instead of working with them towards the same goal. Avoid harsh anionic surfactants (sulphates, olefin sulfonates), anything alkaline, drying alcohol, never scrub at your skin.

Products containing urea or AHAs both hydrate as they gently exfoliate, enzymes are another gentle exfoliating method. See the AHA/ BHA mega reviews linked to in the sidebar.

Moistursers look for skin identical lipids and Natural Moisturising Factors (includes urea). These give your skin the ingredients it can use to help it hold onto water. You might prefer to use NMFs like urea in the day, and heavier lipid rich products at night. See the moisturisers mega reviews linked to in the sidebar.

If all the above still is not enough you can also include ingredients like niacinamide, lactic acid (an AHA), aloe vera or glucosamine. These all boost the skin's own production of components that help it hold water like ceramides and glycosaminoglycans.

But remember that almost all the TV and radio that's made in London or other parts of the country is available to the midlands too. It's not as if we're paying for Londoners to get lots of telly that we're not - it's 'national TV' not 'london TV'

null,false,sb452,null,null,null,"The short answer is that we can't. We want our cats to live long happy lives, and we believe that letting them roam free in urban areas is incompatible with this. That's our view, and if you don't like it, we won't sell you a cat. We talk a lot to prospective owners about responsible cat ownership. This is more than just keeping them inside - for example, we don't sell single kittens to families where no-one is home all day, as we believe bengals need regular stimulation during the day (similar to dogs). This is specific to the breed - not all cats need this, but bengals certainly do. We had one working couple buy a pair of kittens from us (usually okay as they play together), and within 3 months they were uncontrollable. I don't think the couple did anything wrong, but it didn't help that the cats were alone in the house all day. Overall, we say no to about half of all inquiries.

The long answer is that all kittens are sold with a pet contract, and this states that breaking the contract (including letting the cat roam free) means that the owner forfeits the kitten to us. Is this contract legally enforceable? Is it practically enforceable? We've no idea. But at least it is a piece of paper that the new owner signs that they will be a responsible cat owner.

Anyway, you can disagree with us on the specifics, but we (and all other responsible breeders) only sell kittens to people that we are confident will treat the kitten responsibly.
