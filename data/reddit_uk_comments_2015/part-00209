Holding a grudge about it now is pointless - you can be as pissed off as you like, never vote Labour again and all the rest of it, but the establishment aren't ever going to suddenly swerve and start locking up Blair's cabinet for war crimes no matter how many protests or petitions take place. Chances are we won't get to hear the real truth about Iraq until most of them are dead in about 50 years' time.

People blaming Labour are just assigning a scapegoat anyway. The Tories would've gone to Iraq just as readily, and it'd be Iain Duncan Smith who'd be the poisonous pariah of politics.

Rather than obsess over the past, why not think about what can be done for Iraq in the future? You could make a donation to [Warchild](http://m.warchild.org.uk/what-we-do/iraq), or any of the charities set up to help the victims of the war.

Every time my daughter cried I thought I would be judged but in fact most of the mums are lovely. Maybe a bit cautious at first but I soon stopped caring. I was there for me and my little one and I knew I was a dedicated, caring father. 

I would try to get out once a day at least and mix it up:
* swimming
* paid for baby groups, eg sing and sign, Talking Tots
* free baby groups like 10am Wednesday's at the central library. Great group that one
* baby cafes, eg playful cafe (my fav), kudacan, bubba hub, hungry caterpillar 
* play dates at home. Can be so much more relaxing.

I digress, we're in a precarious situation that we do need one or two big names but contrary to popular belief I don't think it's a problem of the club not having enough status to attract these players. At the end of the day they just have to flex their financial might and pay a little bit more in wages to make us seem a more attractive destination. I'd argue that the types of signings we have been making recently (with the exception of Sturridge and maybe Countinho) are a very inefficient way of improving a squad because they need time to settle and develop, and neither of these things are guaranteed to happen from player to player. 

I do feel a structure needs to be in place for dealing with transfers where the choice isn't wholly down to one person, because that puts too much pressure on a single individual. But I think it needs to be more streamlined more like a DoF model, more so that we can act quickly and decisively without the need to consult a Committee before making transfers.

I came back from holiday last week and while coming through passport control discovered I had one of those new-fangled chip passports so I could use the new e-gates. Sweet, swipe and go, right? No.

1/3rd of a fucking plane full of people stood in a *completely stationary* line while the other 2/3rds with conventional passports filtered through the regular eyeball passport control gates while some poor airport worker walked up and down the line asking us all to make sure we had the chip symbol on our passports and to watch the goddamn instructional video when we got to the gate.

So you get to the gate and when the green arrow shows you step into this plexiglass gate type deal, put your passport face down on this scanner and look at this camera for like 5 seconds and then, eventually the gate opens in front of you and you can step through.

They had 3 or 4 of these things in a row. Twice as many as the two eyeball guards on the adjacent side of the gate, but because the damn thing spent 5+ seconds scanning your face or whatever it was doing instead of the 2 seconds it takes the eyeball guards the whole entire process was almost *exactly the same speed*.

As someone who loves seeing how technology can make life more convenient it was goddamn infuriating to see these things take just as long to put half the number of passengers through than the eyeball guards did. British bureaucracy in action, you should never allow ANYONE to do design by committee or this is the kind of shit you end up with.

That's just on the way BACK! On the way out they have like 20 security scanners and stuff and only about 6 or 7 were open for a 9am flight! They literally had to pull about 20/30 of us out of the queue and put us through a specially opened security gate because if they had just carried on at the same pace we all would have missed our flight in the queue! The airport as-is is decidedly NOT a beacon of efficient management. They have tons of space and tons of capacity and nowhere near enough resources to effectively utilise it.

If we had gotten Sanchez, I'd have no problem, even now, with the window from last summer. I think the current Chelsea model of transfers (god help me for saying) is the best way. They buy one (or two, because they're super rich) top players, and then supplement with top youth players who haven't quite made the step up in a top league. They've been able to sell these players for more money later, despite their relative lack of impact in the side, and continue to finance the purchase of top players under FFP.

However there should still be an emergency stop button or something of the like.  It will not randomly jolt the passengers, it'll just stop them at the next break/lift.  

Either this ride was ran poorly, or the system was not in place.  I've not been on the Smiler (or been since it opened, only reason I've not been on!) but it seems as though there are basically two separate sections.  The second car should have had ample time to stop.  It should never enter the second section until the car in front is in a safe zone.  Similarly, the second car should never enter the ride unless the first is fully clear of the first section.

So it's either manufacturing error, as in, this safety precaution was not in place or if it was, it messed up.  Or it was human error, as in, the system requires manual input for the ride to come to a halt.  It's only my experience, but most rides have a mix of both (and should, never rely too heavily on the system to work).  They will have the autonomous sensors to make sure the ride is running smoothly, we ran into issues on one of our rides were the sensor kept fucking up and not picking a car going through so one car would regularly get stuck on a break.  This was the system working, but not working because it kept malfunctioning.  

It's likely human error though.  Emergency stop should just shut down the system and in my opinion, the second car should never have been in any danger of collision.

It just seems to be a giant fuck up.  I wouldn't let this put you/anyone else off coasters though.",null,0,null,1433271398,null,0,false,0,crtabrv,null,t3_387unb,null,t1_crtabrv,null,t1_crt3voi,null,null,null,1436672234,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

My point was far simpler than that, someone asked why the LDs get blamed, the mindset I'm describing, and the logic used to support is why they get blamed. Whether you agree with it or not.

If you look very closely you will see that at no point have i actually said whether i support the view or not. Just that the view exists. 

Do i support it? To some extent yes actually, but whether i do or not doesn't really matter to the basic point i was making which is why people blame the LDs, not whether or not its justified.

If we were to widen it out, as you have, to whether or not that stance is justified - Personally i think you are being VERY kind to the LDs in your assessment. The issue they found themselves addressing was exactly the same issue whether they won a majority (lol) or whether they were a minority partner in a coalition. 

They were expected, based upon their promises, to oppose any rise in tuition fees because they stated their position that it was the right thing to do. Instead they voted for it. This issue is not whether the rise passed parliament, the issue is whether the LDs adequately opposed it, as they promised to. 

If Labour were prepared to vote with the Tories to pass it without LD support, your position might hold some water, but they weren't. The Tories absolutely needed the LD votes, and the LDs could have stopped it from happening, short of an electoral miracle (That the Tories elect to dissolve the coalition, run another general election and then somehow win a majority from where they were - lol). 

That means that the LDs ultimately held a veto over whether this could pass. If they said no, the Tories would have backed down, humiliating or not because they had very few other options that weren't political suicide. The LDs were used to the wilderness, the Tories had far more seats to lose. Not only that but the LDs would have likely stood to gain from going back to the country. They could easily and truthfully claim to be the party of the underdog, the British Bulldog who stood up to the nasty Tories to protect your kids rights to an education. There is virtually no scenario where they don't increase their vote share in these conditions, to some extent.

Courage? This isn't the wild west. This is Westminster. The Conservative party might have been the majority partner, but if the LDs dug their heels in, what exactly do you think the worst case scenario outcome would have been? Nick Clegg taken out by MI5 in the night and shot?

No, they would have simply lost their place in a coalition government, and been back to being an opposition 3rd party, right where their vote share said they should be, and either the Tories would have tried to run a minority government (In which they would have little chance of getting the rise passed) or gone to a general election. 

Refusal to stick to your principles because of fear, or threat - That's a lack of courage

Refusal to stick to your principles because you stand to gain by it - That's a lack of integrity

Let's say Liverpool wants to get some players who can get them to Top 4. By virtue, that means that these players must therefore be good enough to play in a current Champion's League team. Now Liverpool can't afford to pay wages that many of those Top 4 teams can afford due to the stadium and lack of CL earnings. They can't offer Champions League competition, and as Alexis Sanchez showed last year, they can't even compete in terms of location with London. Now even if a player can look past all that, what kind of player would choose to play under Rodgers as opposed to Wenger, Mourinho, van Gaal and the likes? You're probably going to answer either those who can't be guaranteed a first team place in those teams, or young players who want to be developed. Which is exactly what undiscovered gems and unwanted stars mean. Remember that managers like Wenger and van Gaal have a history of developing young players and what do you have left? A very small assortment of players. 

Now imagine you're holding the purse strings. You're faced with players who would be either young prospects or older squad members in a Champions League team. None of whom are bonafide stars.

null,false,DrDuckSays,null,null,null,"I agree, I think this law is very scary to individuals, the amount of companies effected depends on whether you include companies that use encryption (I.e all of them) that would have to let the government in via a backdoor (there is no secure way of doing this as it undermines the encryption itself) or just those providing services to order companies / users.

&gt; Could you give me a hypothetical example of a product which could be effected and how?

A product specifically? Backups to cloud providers (there are several UK companies but the American Dropbox is the easiest example). Companies don't like the personal version of Dropbox because Dropbox holds the encryption keys - this means Dropbox can decrypt their user / confidential data or a hacker could - all beyond the companies control. Company friendly backup tools (I.e crash plan) let the Company set the encryption key. This means crashplan cannot decrypt your data or anyone else.

Now this law would require a backdoor undermining the encryption and allowing the government to snoop on your data (and anyone else that discovers it). This for many is a dealbreaker, a leak could expose corporate secrets (market sensitive) or expose them to massive fines and lawsuits under the data protection act. This company cannot now securely operate in the UK.

Now any foreign business / customers that use UK services - any website, or company that is UK based that hold their data. Their data will now be readable by a foreign government and be a security risk.

This is a very scary law, but I suspect after lobbying it will be end up in a state where only an individual's data must be accessible - and maybe only communications (like whatsapp messages)

Ok i'm staying away from realistic because pretend land is more fun. I am also staying away from the traps of Bale, Ronaldo, Messi and other obvious candidates because lets make things more interesting. 



Fabio Cannavaro circa 2006

Esteban Cambiasso circa 2009

Philip Lahm circa 2009 (first year at RB)

Miroslave Klose in a Germany Uniform circa whenever

Rafael Van der Vaart circa 2010 (as a new Spurs fan I never got to watch him play and I want to be selfish and have some of that for myself)

Mauricio Pochettino Circa 2000

Solidify up our back line. Solid killer in the midfield to play along with Nabil and teach him the ropes. Kane playing with either Miro or Rafy. Play Pochettino in Europa's. Who better to captain the young lads on the field during the campaign than the man picking the XI?

Why would we include those? The bill hasn't even reached draft stage yet and DRIPA and the CDB did not contain any encryption-busting provisions. Let's not get carried away on comments issued by the technically illiterate until we see the law.

&gt;Now this law would require a backdoor undermining the encryption and allowing the government to snoop on your data

Per your example, Dropbox is not classified as a Communication Provider and would not be effected by this law. No backdoor would be mandated. But even if it were, it is only the metadata which would be required.

&gt;Their data will now be readable by a foreign government and be a security risk.

This is already the case through RIPA.

&gt;This still means you have no chance of creating an products like whatsapp, snapchat, gmail, iMessage, Skype etc from the UK that the world will use.

This law will do very little to no damage to such an unlikely prospective firm. Yes a communications provider would be required to keep metadata logs, but very few users care about such things enough to stop using them.

Henderson plays so much better when he's not always looking for Stevie G's approval on the pitch. He's entering his prime years now and is becoming a top class centre mid.

Sterling will still be here because I don't see the club selling him. He'll sign a new contract with a big-club release clause and stay another year or two. He'll get better too.

Coutinho has progressed immensely and is already one of the best attacking midfielders in the premiership. Can see him being a key player for years to come.

Lallana will have a proper pre-season and with his injury problems hopefully behind him he's looked really good lately too.

Markovic, Moreno and Can have had a year to settle and can press on this year. Ibe has come through the academy and looks like he could be a real gem. Origi coming in gives up more options in attack.

Sturridge might even play a few games next season and he might even get a strike partner that can score goals!

Milner is a great signing and so is potentially Clyne. With all this going on I don't see how we can be worse than this season. The only way is up.

We went to various attractions all over the UK but mainly it was alton towers because it is only about an hour away. When I say mainly alton towers I mean we went at least once a month, sometimes twice, on birthdays, fireworks night, in the last 2 mouths of having the cards we went 6 times just to get as much value out of the cards as possible.

Every time we went one of the *big six* (nemesis, 13, rita, smiler, oblivion and air) broke down or wasn't working. There was a big sign saying something like ""dare you do the big six""...yes, I dare. If only they could get some form of consistency.

Only air and oblivion was always working when we were there. Nemesis was down once, in fairness to it then they were planned repairs, not a breakdown. 

13 was down a few times. 

Rita about 5 times. 

Smiler, ahhh the smiler. Maybe I'm being disingenuous but it seemed that the Smiler had issues every time we went. It was usually working but it would break down for 20 minutes here and half hour there. 

Now it looks like I'm getting at alton towers, I'm not. I absolutely love alton towers, I love all the rides. Only the other day we were swithering on whether to get another merlin pass or not. And this incident ***probably*** won't personally put me off going back there or going on the Smiler again.

Ferguson made united what they are today - because he was given time. Wenger has guided Arsenal through moments of absolute dominance and a series of big rebuilds, but they have always remained a high achieving Premier League side. We can't do what Chelsea and City can do, and the modern day United to a lesser degree. 

We have two comparable clubs around us: Arsenal and Tottenham. Both have managed to do consistently well in the league with differing approaches to keeping or sacking managers. Arsenal (with other advantages) have achieved more and with greater consistency. 

Clubs like Newcastle, Leeds, Aston Villa, Everton, and occasionally others, have tried and failed to break into that top pack. For some of them it broke the club. 

I think consistency may be a more important target for the owners than immediate success, partly because it is more likely, and partly because from a business perspective it's lower risk.

The bad PR that comes from stamping all over someone is an investment in making sure people know they **will** be punished for speaking out of turn, or not staying on message.

Osita Mba *(former HMRC solicitor)* blew the whistle to the PAC on the Goldman Sachs deal. He was accused of selling the story to the press, suspended and investigated under RIPA and when the accusations proved unfounded, bullied out of his job. Hayley Dare, blew the whistle on NHS bullying and harm caused by cuts. Basically bullied out of her job *(though unless they finished recently appeals are ongoing)* and received threats the police arrested her manager in connection to. *(Although insufficient evidence was found for a prosecution.)*

When you see a video of an American policeman beating the shit out of someone, the public outrage isn't the enduring message. The real message is, ""We can do this and get away with it. Don't cross us.""

Chelsea finished the season with 2.29

City had 2.09

Arsenal had 1.97

Man United had 1.84

Spurs had 1.68

We had 1.64.


So 2.0 this season would land us third. However next season can be different. Fourth place in 2013/2014 got 2.08 per game.

In 1975, the IRA had a ceasefire with the British security forces and was having secret talks with the government. This upset the diehard loyalists of what is now called the Glenanne gang (which was a mixed group of UVF guys and various members of the security forces, ranging from ordinary RUC cops and UDR squaddies through to, apparently, mid-ranking British Army spook types like Robert Nairac). The loyalists decided that the best way to deal with this was to launch a wave of sectarian assassination (so that the Provisionals would either not respond, causing the kind of crisis that split the IRA in '69 in the first place, or they would end up retaliating, which would put the talks in jeopardy. History shows that it was the latter that happened, and given the timing, Kingsmills was probably the last straw - the ceasefire was called off about 2-3 weeks later).

Between the security forces who actually outright sided with the loyalists (e.g. those guys in the Glenanne Gang), and those hostile to the government (such as the actual British Army press office who were planting forged news stories against British and Irish politicians, including Ted Heath and Harold Wilson), and the guys in 14 Intelligence Company who had a policy of deliberately inciting loyalists and republican paramilitaries against each other (Robert Nairac, for instance, from multiple accounts, was running about with the UVF, and was later killed while trying to infiltrate the Provisionals in Armagh), you had multiple groups inside the security forces all with a motive for letting Kingsmills happen. Your mistake is to treat the security forces as a single homogeneous unit instead of realising that there are multiple factions inside them, often mutually hostile or distrustful. I don't think that the British government proper (i.e. the politicians in the Cabinet and anyone honestly carrying out their instructions) would have had a motive for having anything to do with Kingsmills, but there are elements in the British state that might have.

Whether they did of course, is a completely different matter. That's what inquiries and investigations are for, and as I say, there are now serious allegations of British government involvement.

And of course, it has to be pointed out that the IRA members who perpetrated the atrocity are the main culprits of the atrocity.",null,0,null,1433278560,null,0,1433279126,0,crtf587,null,t3_384gau,null,t1_crtf587,null,t1_crtdwxm,null,null,null,1436675613,null,5,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,5,null

I only thought of it because a bisexual mate of mine was sent to prison for 6 years and apparently they ""forgot"" about his parole or whatever, so he had to do the whole stretch.  It was for selling class A's and he was caught with slightly too much of the stuff for it to be a slap on the wrist.

However, he's a big black guy who I wouldn't dream of messing with.  He told me that within a week of being inside he was in a relationship with another guy in prison and it helped smooth things for him.  

Apparently he bottomed for this guy, and was occasionally even loaned out for use by other prisoners for whatever reason.  My mate is bi, but in no way would you ever think he was a bottom.
And that said - I'm gay myself, I know all about the ""man of steel, boots of helium"" thing - the more muscly and hard they look, the quicker they throw their ankles in the air... but this guy just seemed too alpha for me to picture him taking it.  I wonder how much is true and how much he might be embellishing the story.  Fuck, maybe he was trying to see if it turned me on!

Key (Mike related) Points:  

* Final Score Le Tissier et al 11 - 6 Invisible Cow Samurai Warriors (Miomike's team)  
* Miomike setting up the first goal with a pass that got a ""nice ball"" from Le Tissier.  
* Miomike scored a goal that included battling, a nice trick, and a finish by giving the keeper (Le Tissier Junior) the eye then putting it in the other corner.  
* Miomike tackling Le Tissier multiple times, including when he would have been through on goal, causing a wail of despair.  
* Miomike being nutmegged by Le Tissier.  
* Miomike being done by Le Tissier but kicking him quite hard in the shins.  
* Gordon Watson telling Miomike that Le Tissier will ""see him out front after"" for the kick in the last minute.  
* ~~Miomike punching Le Tissier in the face and knocking him out in one~~

edit- another important failure of rodgers: i can't count the times last season that he substituted a player at half-time. it's ok to happen sometimes - when a player is at a bad day - but the rate that it happened, at least, leaves questions about his game planning.

Can you expand on this?  What about them is much better?  I mean, obviously I'm aware that hydroponics and home grown weed have radically changed the cannabis market, but does that make modern cannabis strictly _better_?    I mean, back in the day, if you knew where to look and who to ask, you could always get hold of Manali say, which was top quality draw, and many people much prefer hash to weed which is all there seems to be these days.  As for other drugs, I suppose each would be different, but surely dexamphetamine would be far preferable to many people than methamphetamine say, which again has not necessarily been a positive shift.  I don't claim to be any sort of expert, and the purity of some drugs has clearly gone up, some have become easier to acquire, some harder and fashions have changed; but I'm not clear that there has been a uniform improvement in quality.

Most should have an autonomous system to prevent this.  Such as in the example I gave, there'd be a sensor that tells the main system the next car can be sent out and then the operator would be okay to send it.

However I have no idea how The Smiler is set up. By the looks of it, either this system is in place and messed up (still, the operator shouldn't be sending the next car out in my opinion!) or it has nothing of the sort in place, which would then be on the training and operating of the ride. 

Another thing I'm going to point out.  Which is making me think the front car wasn't a test.  Why would you load when a test is ongoing?  You wouldn't.  It makes no sense.  You'd have to unload if there was an issue and you'd just get angry customers.  I feel like the first car was just a lazy attempt, and more than likely seems to be because the operator didn't want to reset the loading procedure and just sent it round empty after the tests had already been done.  I don't know quite how to explain that.  But some rides are just faster to send a free train round and bring through the next one, then it is to reset the loading mechanism on the one already in station.  It just makes little sense to me that they'd load if that first one was really a test.

Well, that's great.  However if it takes 2 years, costs 20,000 pounds and results in the Mum needing to invent allegations of rape, violence and sexual abuse of children to justify herself, then that's not really acceptable.  

Even if at the end 'there is no bias'.   If Mum shuts of access and starts throwing mud, the burden is on the Father to prove himself innocent.   At the end of it you end up with a violently hostile relationship between the parents and little kids entirely unable to understand the hostility.

There is a misconception in society that things like 'contempt of court', 'perjury' and 'witness tampering' exist.  The fact is, if a woman invents claims of rape and sexual abuse of children then bullies her own children into lying to CAFCASS (the social workers on the side of the courts) so she doesn't look bad then the punishment for all these things is .... nothing.  She'll still get a settlement favourable to her.  

The real issue isn't always the outcomes.  It's about a message that shutting off access to kids and calling someone a pedo to justify it is unacceptable to society.  Unfortunately the courts are fine with it.  They just want to settle the matter and move on to the next one.

He averaged 3.4 interceptions per game which is the fourth highest in the league (after Coquelin, Koscielny and Jedinak - two defensive mids and a CB who is, frankly, a lot better) and the 12th highest average of clearances per game. Of the 11 above him, 8 played for West Ham or relegated teams (so were naturally more under the cosh) and the other 3 were Phil Jagielka, Martin Skrtel and Ashley Williams - all great leaders who had very good seasons (yes, even Skrtel).

He also averaged the highest number of blocks per game, joint with Jason Shackell of relegated Burnley.

^NB ^These ^figures ^are ^based ^on ^20 ^league ^games ^- ^a ^slightly ^smaller ^sample ^size ^than ^some ^other ^players.

Of course, stats aren't everything. Is he perfect? Jesus fucking Christ absolutely not, go wash your mouth out with soap before Ledley gives you a hiding. But is he a very solid, old-fashioned big-bodied-yet-immobile centre-back in the mould of, say, John Terry? Pretty much.

If you constantly put him on the back foot by letting the opposition counter attack and run at him all day then naturally he'll fuck up - we saw that several times last season.

The £2000 was a upper reasonable limit - during the interview I've mentioned a total cost between £1k-£2k for the full length finished tram, not the section you know from the photos. 
There are a few factors why cost of bespoke creations is higher than the LEGO set of similar shape/size, mostly down to the build quality and bricks availability. Basically the building style of the tram is different from the original LEGO models, even their tram/train - I'm not making sacrifices to fit within a budget or something - if the brick is needed - it's added to the model.

Willy mcgrath was the Nonce that worked as house master at Kincora. He was at the centre of the pedo, rape business but also ran a *far right loyalist group that worked with loyalist paramilitaries/terrorist groups* called **TARA**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_%28Northern_Ireland%29

If this isnt ringing alarm bells I dont know what else will. 

Mi5 would have had extensive dealings with the loyalists as they were a useful ally in the war against the republicans. 
It looks like its pretty apparent that Thatchers Tory government and MI5 had no problems working with Loyalist, terrorists that were running a paedophile network.

I just heard an except of it on a video on the bbc news website, it and it motived me to come back here and convert that downvote to an upvote.

""Charles Kennedy on form, on a good day, when he was feeling strong and healthy, had more political talent in his little finger than the rest of us put together.""

Clegg's delivery, emphasising the *on a good day*, rang out like a bell, and the way he then casually slips in the ""when he was feeling strong and healthy"" just stinks.

His message translates - to me anyway - as ""Charles Kennedy could be a great politician on the one or two good days that he had in his career"".

Maybe Nick feels the need to justify voting him out in 2006 after his alcoholism revelation; maybe he feels aggrieved that Charlie was against the coalition; or maybe he just isn't aware how it sounds, but I totally agree with you that it doesn't sound great.

It's a form of SIPP where essentially you buy units in a managed fund (much like shares) and it's the value of your holdings that dictates the value of your pension, hence it can go up and down.  This is obviously **not** the same as a bank account and holdings may vary - some pension funds do it that way, others do weird shit like buy and sell property.

Anyway, let's assume you're in the 16-29 category.  What should happen is that your monthly *gross* pay will be reduced by 2% (your contribution) and the company will match that with 4% of the original amount.

Example: 

* You earn £2000 a month gross.  
* Your 2% contribution (in this case £40) is deducted at source, hence your monthly gross pay has dropped to £1960.  
* The company's matched contribution is 4% of that original £2000 (in this case £80)... hence your pension will receive a payment of **£120pcm** (which will probably be used to buy £120 worth of units in the fund)
* The £1960 left over is subject to the usual income tax and NI calculations and deductions as if that £40 never existed.  It has, thus, reduced your tax bill.

It's a fantastic system which basically offers you free money and trust me when I say you don't notice your contributions missing, as you don't miss what you never had.  Bear in mind that these are *percentages* of your monthly gross income, such that the exact amount contributed will adjust in line with your salary at the new percentage.

These contribution amounts do seem very low, if I'm honest.  I don't want to give the amounts that come off my pay because it could very well identify the company I work for, but they're much higher than that.  

My employer will also increase their contributions (to a certain limit) if I increase my own - is this something you can do while inside those age bands?",null,0,null,1433286384,null,0,1433286576,0,crtjvub,null,t3_38a0fj,null,t1_crtjvub,null,t3_38a0fj,null,null,null,1436679178,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

The deal you're being offered there seems good in terms of matching - they're always contributing twice the amount that you are, so you get an immediate 200% return just for taking part. In your place I suspect I would quite definitely take them up on that. Whether you then also invest more is really up to you and what you can afford. 

Or another way to approach the problem would be to ask how much of an income you expect to need in retirement, from that derive how much of a pension pot you need (either to buy an annuity or to slowly withdraw from over the course of what could be several decades), and work back from that how much you need to be saving now... all of those calculations are fraught with assumptions about rates of growth and how your income changes, and what you'll need, but if you try a range of optimistic and pessimistic figures it would give you a range to consider.",null,0,null,1433286727,null,0,1433328404,0,crtk2nw,null,t3_38a0fj,null,t1_crtk2nw,null,t3_38a0fj,null,null,null,1436679331,null,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3,null

It'll definitely still be more expensive than Newcastle though.

In terms of the culture of the city, I really like Birmingham - the people are much friendlier and laid back than down south, and there's been a lot of regeneration of the city centre recently. There's theatres, lots of bars and restaurants, SeaLife, more canals than Venice, really good shopping, some excellent museums and art galleries, pretty much anything really! And the NEC is nearby (10 minutes on the train from the city centre) which hosts loads of events and gigs.

The university isn't in the city centre but there's a train station on campus  with direct trains to the centre which take about 7 minutes and cost maybe like £1?

&gt;No. A default is when someone breaches the terms of their debt repayment, and the lender does not receive what they are entitled to. This tends to make it extremely difficult to borrow more.

Sure they might get back their nominal amounts but devastated purchasing power.

&gt;Regardless, an investor in government securities wants to buy a product subject to the risk of inflation and currency devaluation. The possibility of making little gains in real terms is the cost of having an extremely certain nominal return in that currency. 

Look at pension funds the past 10 years or Brown's 2nd bottom of -26% growth on pensions. Pensions are forced to buy such things. 

&gt;Calling the fully intended and anticipated events affecting a security ""default"" is totally stupid.

Again they lose purchasing power, people lose faith. The end result is the same. Saying money printing isn't a form of default is pretty dumb.

Honestly, some of these guys could pay rent if they didn't spend their money elsewhere. Some of the guys who sit outside the shop I work at make more money a day than me. But they've got other priorities. 
There's also a fair number who work rather than beg. I know a guy who was working as a builder and sending all his money home to Romania to take care of his Mum. Again, other priorities, and I guess just acclimatised to the privation of sleeping rough.

Assuming you don't know about it, we played a match several years back and as a result of a lot of screw ups by the police mainly, 96 fans lost their lives. The story is terrible and gets worse when you hear the truth behind what happened. And it's STILL not over. ESPN did a 30 for 30 documentary on it last year and it's wonderful. I highly recommend you watch it. It's important.

Well there's my 2 cents!

How was he stubborn in his tactics?  He switched formations throughout the season as well as personnel as befitting the situation, like adding a CB to hold onto a lead or taking of a more defensive player for an offensive one.  

Transfer wise I'll admit there is something to be desired but Sahko was been great, as well as Can.  

For me Moreno and Markovic get a pass because aside from some positional mistakes they to be good players and are still very young. 

Balotelli and Lovren were mistakes, granted, but every club makes those.  And Lovren could still come good, I don't think he will but I've been wrong before.  

While the rest were just average signings.  

The two (possible) signings of Milner and Ings seem to be regarded universally as pretty solid additions.  

Aspas has already been sold and Borini looks to be on his way out as well.  Johnson, Gerrard, Jones and (hopefully) Enrique will most likely be gone, if anything BR is good at trimming the fat from a squad.  Those wages will save LFC a ton of money.  

Look with Klopp taking a year off and Frank De Boer wanting another seasons with Ajax the best thing to do is wait another year.  I admit that Rodgers has his faults, every manager does, but I think this will probably be his last year regardless unless he wins the Europa or Prem title.

I say this as an ARDENT supporter of Rodgers. None of you lot would accept us being in 8th. It doesn't matter if we were playing like Barcelona. Fact is you cannot be in 8th, at any point in the season, if you're creating chances, have an identity, a steady lineup, etc. You would be higher. There are not 7 clubs capable of doing all those things better than us.

My expectation is that a lot of our fans are going to be embarrassed to have underestimated just how important it will be for our signings from last summer to have been bedded in for a year. They also underestimate how beneficial it will be to actually see Gerrard go.

In a strange way, and I know this from my experience watching sport and as a player, there are players who respond to getting increased responsibility by playing better. Basically there are those that rise and those that fall. We have some fiesty fuckers in our side. Coutinho, Hendo, Can, Lallana, and even Sturridge would all fall under the category of people who are extremely determined.

While everyone talks about the potential lack of leadership, I think the real issue is that we have a number of young leaders ready to step up but Gerrard's presence, somewhat understandably, stifled their ability to set a tone themselves.

Anyways. My expectation is that we will be between 2-5 come January. Carragher and everyone else can laugh at that, but Carragher also said that if he thought we'd be in with a chance to win the title in 2013-2014 he wouldn't have retired. Being in 2-4 in January doesn't mean we own any of those spots, but most of you underestimate how easy it is to go through dips in performance. 

It is very unlikely Arsenal, Chelsea, City, or United are going to invest heavily. They'll look to consolidate gains. But no one has any real momentum going into next year which means we very well could be in 2nd come January and still finish 5th overall.


Some people are going to have to realize that a battle fought strongly for 5th is not cause to fire Rodgers or any manager.

Of course if you're unhappy with the show in general, it makes sense to blame the writers *because* Capaldi is clearly an excellent actor.  In my view, the audacity of writing an entire arc of unique episodes devoted to the new Doctor's deep and difficult existential crisis has put off viewers who were expecting something else, so that they feel unsettled and disappointed and need somebody to blame.  What I've been seeing a lot of in discussions, though, is comments from fans who've done a couple of re-watches of S8 and have, it seems, gotten past their disappointed expectations and realized what a great Season it was if they looked at what it does instead of what they've been upset that it didn't do.

In the first season of BR, we tried to play possession football. In the second season, we played counter attacking. In this season, we tried both and failed in both.

And this season, it was expected that smaller opposition teams will sit back and counter. So they were letting us have all the ball and marked Coutinho from producing anything. And bigger teams were able to maintain possession and still win against us as we were not good enough in counters and our defense was bad.

If we are going to play, counter attacking football, we need a better defense. Or a Suarez led strikeforce. Our defense is not good enough to stop others from scoring goals. 

I think Brendan should create a balance between attacking and defending. We cannot out score opponents anymore. So if we defend as a team, it would be better.

That's because most people are idiots when it comes to the national debt. We have a high national debt because we have socialised private debt, ie bank debt. In 2008 the state took over a black hole when the economy crashed because of private debt. That was what the whole bailout was about. The Tory solution is austerity, or more specifically to force the public debt back in private hands again. 

Their whole policy is to increase private debt - which was what cratered in 2008. I can only conclude that the government is deeply incompetent.

null,false,Liqqeh,null,null,null,"My issue at the moment is that it's hard to identify what a classic ""Liverpool goal"" looks like for us. Chelsea relentlessly dances around the box, whilst United have recently been successful having Fellaini knock down balls to the on-rushing forwards. Much like what a lot of others have said, we first need to define the style that we want to play. Whether it's possession based tiki-taka, counter attack, non-stop pressing (somewhat our style this season), hold up play in the final 3rd, etc... 

Rodgers clearly isn't a fan of defensive midfielders, as evidenced by his limited use of Lucas and his avoidance in signing a new one. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as the rest of the squad is able to pick up the slack defensively. What has been our strength and our weakness has been our ability to switch formation, and at times inability to later on adjust when needed.

Call me a traditionalist, but I like the old school 4-4-2 in the ""diamond"" shape, a lot like what we played with Suarez and Sturridge. Obviously we don't have Suarez, but the beauty of the formation is that it allows two forwards to rush the box, and limits how often we need to send in crosses, which is something we are abysmal at. Something like:

         Studge    Ings/Balo/whoever
        Coutinho/Lallana
         Hendo       Milner
             Lucas


I know it isn't perfect, but its impossible to find a solid formation to fit all of our midfielders, and at time Can, Lallana, Allen, Ibe will be benched but obviously rotated in based on form. My ideal Liverpool would play a hard pressing game, particularly to take advantage of the talented midfield engine players we have/may have in Hendo, Can, Milner, and even Allen to some degree.

Bollocks, absolute bollocks mate.

There's a huge difference between being spooked by another animal  and being relentlessly pursued across the countryside. Foxes have no natural predators that are going to chase them.

Would you be equally as traumatised after jumping because of a loud noise as you would if you'd been chased through the streets by a lad with a knife?

No, no you wouldn't. Don't be fucking ridiculous.

&gt;he dogs are trained to put the fox down quickly. They go for the jugular and kill it instantly.

Again, there's plenty of evidence to say that this frequently doesn't happen.

&gt;Okay, well clearly your opinion is infallible despite being completely baseless.

Baseless? That doesn't make sense. 

It is my *opinion* that killing animals for sport is wrong. I don't need evidence for that. 

That's also the position of the vast majority of the people in the United Kingdom.

They've already started - it's even more restrictive than the smoking ban. You're not allowed to wank in public places or in most workplaces. You're not allowed to wank on public transport (remember the 1980s when everyone on the top deck was either smoking or wanking?), or even in your own car if you can be seen from the road or there's a child in the car with you.

This tactic would also favour the playstyle Martinez wants to implement since it is a safe tactic with a lot of flexibility. It is perfect for possession based plays and you can still use a Besic or Barry at DM position who puts long balls from deep if that would be needed. Both players have nice abilities to do that as well. 

If more offensive power is needed then use the same CM duo(Barkley, McCarthy but have Naismith play a deeper role together with Lukaku up front. 

Both formations give a nice flexibility and good rotation options with Gibson McCarthy and Barkley rotating in the CM role and Barry Besic in the DM.

choose whether to have intercourse on the relevant occasion, she is not consenting, and subject 
to questions about the defendant’s state of mind, if intercourse takes place, this would be rape. 
However, where the complainant has voluntarily consumed even substantial quantities of alcohol, 
but nevertheless remains capable of choosing whether or not to have intercourse, and in drink agrees 
to do so, this would not be rape. We should perhaps underline that, as a matter of practical reality, 
capacity to consent may well evaporate well before a complainant becomes unconscious. Whether this 
is so or not, however, is fact specific, or more accurately, depends on the actual state of mind of the 
individuals involved on the particular occasion'*

TLDR Translink won't give out timetables in any format, won't license those timetables for use in commercial apps (and they believe all app projects are commercial, I tried that whole ""open source"" angle), and don't know where their stops are for mapping purposes. (They blame LPS for that last one)

In a vaguely related note, biggest problem with Moovit is that it's hell-unreliable if any timetable or route changes, and Translink are in the habit of shuffling the chairs on the titanic fairly regularly to make sure they appear to be doing something useful. And that's the first thing they'll do once they get wind of any meaningful app. So yeah, I wouldn't invest too much time in this.

null,false,Chilton_Squid,,I don't have a bike,null,"First up (and I'm sure you probably know this), but don't even consider your road insurance valid, because it's not. One company (MCE I think) offer ""inclusive track cover"", but it has a 50% excess and most importantly, you're putting a claim against your road insurance if you crash. This you have to declare every time you renew, your premiums go up. 

I insured a car on track a couple of times through Moris (not sure if they do bikes) and because there's no third-party aspect involved, the premium is essentially just a percentage of the insured value. Most importantly though, it's not a road policy so you don't have to declare it when you renew your insurance each year. That's the biggest advantage. They have a few options such as ""do you want fairing cover"" which affect the premium, up to you what you want to do there. 

Unless it's a valuable road bike you couldn't afford to lose, personally I wouldn't bother. I crashed mine at Snetterton yesterday but it was only fairly low speed and it's a track bike so I don't care about fairings etc; it's only really if you have a high-speed crash (which are very rare) that you'll generally do enough damage to warrant it. 

At the end of the day, it's up to your personal circumstances. If you're taking a valuable bike you can't afford to lose, then by all means insure it - but it'll cost you at least the track fees over again, if not more. If you have the money and knowledge to fix it up yourself, or the bike isn't worth much, don't bother.

This is not true.  Employers are required to give you at least 28 days leave but they are not required to allow you to take all (or any) of it at times of your choosing.  They can, and to a greater or lesser extent most do, require you to take your leave at specified times.  An extreme example is teachers who get substantially more than the minimum but generally have no control over when they take it.  

I currently get 33 days paid leave which is made up of  25 days which I can take at any time (subject to business requirements) plus 8 bank holidays when the office is closed and I cannot work even if I wanted to.  This is compliant with the law.

My previous job started with 20 discretionary days plus 8 bank holidays which again was legal because it satisfied the minimum.

Now the money goes to the school and they can spend it how they please.

Of course, they no longer have the support services the LEA provided. They need those support services and they can't provide them on their own. That's why the academies band together into trusts. The trust is essentially a replacement for the LEA.

So the upside is that schools are now fully in control of their own destinies. If they don't like a trust, they can leave it and join a different one. They couldn't do that with LEAs. It's a similar idea to putting GPs in charge of commissioning in the NHS, I suppose.

There are a number of downsides, however.

- Trusts are not very accountable and there seems to be a higher level of corruption and poor spending decisions.
- There's a big question mark over whether trusts are better than LEAs.
- Trusts tend to be run like businesses.
- Finally, in the last parliament, certain heads of trusts were ""given the nod"" from the government that they would be able to break away from government control and privatise. In the end they didn't do it as they felt it would be politically difficult, but unquestionably this was the original intent. This is why some trusts expanded so rapidly, grabbing any school they could - they were on an asset grab in the run up to privitisation.

This had the twin effects of decreasing tax receipts and increasing unemployment claims.

After the crisis, firms and households need to repaid their balance sheets, and are generally more circumspect.  This means that the private sector wants to net save, by accumulating safe financial assets, namely government debt.  This can happen in two main ways.  Either through an increase in the government spending, so as to make more safe financial assets available to the public by actively increasing the deficit.  Or, if the government tries to keep spending low, it happens through a slowdown in economic activity and a decrease in tax receipts, which is what happened a few years ago.

I want him to do good, but as I said, there is no sign that he will get better. He is that manager from isles, whose knowledge of players, of tactics and etc. is limited by British isles and as he said, even him playing Champions League, his biggest success will be getting Swansea into PL.

null,false,DOMO71,null,null,null,"Exactly. We do not really have a style of play, and same it is with preferable formation. There is no stability in the tactics nor the formation. Rodgers was just randomly changing throughout the season and to our best formation, which was 3-4-3, the system invented and brought here by Van Gaal, was just copied. This was also the reason, why they beat us in, from my point of view, the most important match of the season. 

For me were the best formation 4-3-2-1 or the standard 4-3-3. We really need the system, which will get the maximum of our current offensive force (which is not really) on one side and secure our defence on the other. Of course that is a little bit buck-passing approach, but I think that the most crucial position and the most needed player is the modern CM. Kovacic, Kondogbia are those kind of players. Players, who can dribble and get the ball upfront, who can inteligently pass, but who are also defensively disciplined. This would massively improve our centre-backs situation, especially with the horrifying promise of Lovren playing next season.

Easier and less expensive on time and money to skip this one out and see what people say than to go to an event a second time expecting better.

I was also not in the main hall as I didn't plan on playing Dota originally, but had to move after several hours of postponement as there was completely 0 connection where I was, lan or otherwise.

Everyone has had their own experiences, mine just happened to be particularly shit. I series is run off of a LES whereas epic has only promised FTTC - my job is in the telecom and IT industry so I'm all too aware this means there are no assurances of fix times if things break. Ethernet over FTTC is a product that assures SLA ontop of a base product provided by BT wholesale (as it runs on the openreach copper and fibre network between the exchange and site), therefore I'm not convinced.

If I had been to an epic before that didn't have a laughably poor IT setup and it worked just fine, I'd probably go. I'm putting my money where my mouth is here and not going this time round. 

It's less of a complaint than a nod to the admins for acknowledging the issues, but I can't say they're addressed fully from a technical standpoint. It's expensive to put in place what should be there - I series pulls it off (they have a LES with a diversely routed failover) as its a bigger lan. Maybe I just prefer bigger lans?

null,false,WakingWoes,null,null,null,"&gt;Foxes have no natural predators that are going to chase them.

You're not quite right, birds of prey are the largest predator for fox cubs. Birds of prey will give chase to young foxes, but the adult fox is all but without predator and that is why they require population control. They're vermin. They slaughter chickens and rabbits by the dozen, simply for fun. Do their lives matter to you?

&gt;Again, there's plenty of evidence to say that this frequently doesn't happen.

There's plenty of photos of roadkill or 'we found this dead fox by the road and think it must have been hunted', but never anything solid. If the huntsman cannot control the hounds, the fox might be dismembered, but this is only after the fox has been killed by the leading hound. It doesn't suffer.

&gt;Baseless? That doesn't make sense.
It is my opinion that killing animals for sport is wrong. I don't need evidence for that.

You do need evidence to support your opinions if you want people to take them seriously. It could be my opinion that the proper thing to do is wear a cod on your head, but a cursory amount of research into headwear suggests otherwise.

&gt;No, elaborate on how people are supposedly misinformed. Misinformed about what?

They're misinformed about what actually goes on during a hunt. How many times have you heard things like ""the animal collapses from exhaustion"" or ""the terrified animal is ripped apart""? They're copied word-for-word from PETA posters and leaflets, and anybody blessed with the gift of critical thought knows that PETA are not above exaggerating and outright lying about animal welfare in exchange for money. Take [this](http://www.peta2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jona-weinhofen-wool-ad.jpg) poster, for example. You know what a lamb really looks like after shearing? Like [this](http://rusticranchwife.com/uploads/3/5/8/7/3587107/4224134_orig.jpg). PETA aims their propaganda at people who live in cities and suburbs and haven't spent enough time around animals to understand why they are treated the way they are. Sheep are bred with the purpose of wool production and need shearing to stay healthy. The Fox evolved to quickly kill small mammals and birds in large numbers and needs culling to maintain the ecological balance of the countryside.

Killing animals for enjoyment isn't condemned when it comes to fishing, or a new pair of leather boots or a steak for dinner.

null,false,OriginalLamLam,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt;You're not quite right, birds of prey are the largest predator for fox cubs. Birds of prey will give chase to young foxes, but the adult fox is all but without predator and that is why they require population control.

So when you said that relentlessly hunting terrified foxes through the countryside was normal for a fox, that was indeed bollocks.

&gt;They're vermin. They slaughter chickens and rabbits by the dozen, simply for fun. Do their lives matter to you?

Blood sport =/= population control.

&gt;There's plenty of photos of roadkill or 'we found this dead fox by the road and think it must have been hunted', but never anything solid.

Um, no, there are plenty of photos of foxhounds with bits of fox in their mouths.

&gt;If the huntsman cannot control the hounds, the fox might be dismembered, but this is only after the fox has been killed by the leading hound. It doesn't suffer.

There are also plenty of images and videos of foxes being attacked by foxhounds in which the fox most certainly isn't being killed quickly.

&gt;You do need evidence to support your opinions if you want people to take them seriously.

I'm sorry, what evidence are you looking for? Do you not understand that what you're saying doesn't make sense? It is my opinion that blood sports are wrong. I don't understand how you'd like me to evidence that.

&gt;They're copied word-for-word from PETA posters and leaflets, and anybody blessed with the gift of critical thought knows that PETA are not above exaggerating and outright lying about animal welfare in exchange for money. Take this poster, for example. You know what a lamb really looks like after shearing? Like this. PETA aims their propaganda at people who live in cities and suburbs and haven't spent enough time around animals to understand why they are treated the way they are. Sheep are bred with the purpose of wool production and need shearing to stay healthy.

I don't give a shit about PETA, sorry. They have no bearing on my opinion.

&gt;The Fox evolved to quickly kill small mammals and birds in large numbers and needs culling to maintain the ecological balance of the countryside.

So kill them humanely?

&gt;Killing animals for enjoyment isn't condemned when it comes to fishing, or a new pair of leather boots or a steak for dinner. Why is fox hunting so different in your opinion?

With these acquisitions, Mason could be used as a backup for his current position and for Eriksen, which we desperately need, and Pritchard could also be used for. For me Stambouli also deserves a run next to Bentaleb, which I think may be why we don't seem to be intending to sell him, though I wouldn't be overly upset if we did and bought another DM. Also, although he has shown his delivery is excellent, Dier is not a RB, and should be used for what we bought him for. I still have faith in Townsend and Lamela, so I think we're alright on the right wing, and if Ayew has indeed signed for us, then we have the backup we needed for Chadli on the left. I also think it'd be worth giving Milos a shot at taking the spot next to Bentaleb, as he seems to be highly rated and wouldn't cost us any extra.

As a UK resident, you will be liable to tax on worldwide income and gains as they arise. However, there are sometimes special allowances you may be entitled to (if remain non-domiciled) such as the Overseas Work Day relief. And if you have overseas income, it may be wise to look into the remittance basis of taxation which would only tax foreign income if it's remitted into the UK rather than on an arising basis. However, this may cause you to lose your personal allowance.



There are also other taxes, for example, if you have a car you will have to pay an annual road tax which is based on car emissions (paid online). Other taxes include council tax (based on the value of the property in April 1991), Capital Gains Tax (however reliefs such as PPR may be available) etc. Of course there are many exceptions, such as ISA's that allow for tax-free interest on savings and pension funds that allow for tax-free contributions and also lower your taxable salary.

The parts you posted doesn't really seem to say 'if she's drunk its rape or assume no consent' it even mentions itself it goes down to state of mind of individual and the situation which can vary when it comes to rape. So breaking down with alcohol it can be a complex situation to determine what happened.


&gt;'If, through drink (or for any other reason) the complainant has temporarily lost her capacity to choose whether to have intercourse on the relevant occasion, she is not consenting, and subject to questions about the defendant’s state of mind, if intercourse takes place, this would be rape.

Is drunk or for another reason (drugged, sleep etc) the person clearly was unable to consent it can be considered a rape took place. 

&gt;However, where the complainant has voluntarily consumed even substantial quantities of alcohol, but nevertheless remains capable of choosing whether or not to have intercourse, and in drink agrees to do so, this would not be rape. 

When they have consumed voluntarily lot of alcohol and given consent and is able to continue to give consent, this could be considered as not rape. 

&gt;We should perhaps underline that, as a matter of practical reality, capacity to consent may well evaporate well before a complainant becomes unconscious. Whether this is so or not, however, is fact specific, or more accurately, depends on the actual state of mind of the individuals involved on the particular occasion'

Takes into account the person may at one point say yes but then later be in a state where they loose the ability to continue to give consent so like loss of consciousness. This could remove the ability and choice to remove consent. Like how well someone can function when entering state of being black out drunk, visibly losing speech and mobility skills. They conclude this is down to the individuals state of mind in those instances and might risk rape conclusion.

TL;DR tabloids making up conclusions. Report doesn't seem to say 'courts should assume drunk women can't consent' but instead seems to highlight different complex circumstances around giving consent and keeping ability to remove or continue consent when it comes to rape or sex involving alcohol or other reasons.

The notion of training foxhounds is not ridiculous. You're not understanding.

You were asked why you hunted. One of your responses was that it is good training for the dogs. That's not answering the question. It doesn't make any sense. 

Your reason for doing something can't be that it makes doing that thing easier. 

&gt;The hunts in themselves have little effect, but the training the foxhounds undergo in preparation does. The hunt propagates the training which in turn propagates the hunt.

This also doesn't make any sense. I'm struggling to grasp how you think that this makes any sense.

Foxhunting has little effect on fox populations. But it trains the foxhounds to hunt foxes, which has little effect on fox populations.

In terms of culture, the hunt has the prior claim. The practice of hunting has occurred in it's current guise for several centuries. The practice of banning things you dislike on a left-wing moral crusade was regrettably spawned by New Labour in the 90s.

Have you ever seen an Eagle or large owl pursue its prey? 

&gt; Blood sport =/= population control.

I really don't know how to respond to you here if you can't put together the concept of culling and population control.

&gt; Um, no, there are plenty of photos of foxhounds with bits of fox in their mouths.

I've explained this previously, the hounds will only ever dismember the fox if they are poorly trained, and this occurs after the fox is stone dead.

&gt; There are also plenty of images and videos of foxes being attacked by foxhounds in which the fox most certainly isn't being killed quickly.

How can you tell if the fox is dead or dying from an image? I'd also love to see a video where the fox is maimed before death.

&gt; I'm sorry, what evidence are you looking for? Do you not understand that what you're saying doesn't make sense? It is my opinion that blood sports are wrong. I don't understand how you'd like me to evidence that.

Your opinion on hunting is marred by a lack of evidence and a startling dependence on PETA nonsense.

&gt; I don't give a shit about PETA, sorry. They have no bearing on my opinion.

Not directly, but many of the phrases you've repeated here entered the public consciousness via PETA campaigns. 

&gt; So kill them humanely?

It is humane.

&gt; Because of the manner of the killing. This should be fairly obvious.

If we're talking about the reception of Foot in 1983… that was three decades ago, after the Falklands (which was a big coup for Thatcher's popularity).  He was so far left of Ed that it misses out a huge chunk of more-pragmatic socialism in between, and the manifesto wasn't exactly the most well-written-and-marketed thing in existence.

Perhaps we're working on opinion polls.  But they've been shown time and again to be inaccurate, and keep painting different pictures.  One of the other articles on this subreddit (I can't remember which) pointed out some opinion polling (heh) that actually suggested that a lot of our more progressive policies were quite well-received.

And if it's anything to do with how the media is portraying a right-wing message, then that's probably because they're funded by people with vested interests in a Conservative or UKIP government, by (excuse my inner Owen Jones) people who want the working class to turn on itself and ignore the man behind the curtain.  The media want us to believe that how you eat a bacon sandwich is reflective of your competence in government.  Why should we treat the media line with anything other than a well-voiced contempt?

I think it's more the advertisement than anything else: turns out that if you shape your message to be a loose bag of ‘screw the rich’ stabs, and miss the boat on convincing people you're credible on the economy, you lose elections.  Ed wasn't exactly left-wing to begin with, he just managed to get painted as dangerously lefty by the right-wing media, and their message wasn't strongly challenged.

Electable or not, there _should_ have been a left-wing candidate in the election.  Not necessarily to get elected, but to keep the debate lively and two-sided, and not just the centre-right echo chamber that it's become.  We needed a Diane Abbott, or a Tony Benn, but not necessarily a Michael Foot. :P

EDIT: yeah, I know it looks like I've built up three straw-men here, but I'm not sure of what the reasoning for the perception of anything beyond Ed being unelectable is here, so I'm covering the bases I can think of.",null,0,null,1433325949,null,0,false,0,crtzqim,null,t3_389njh,null,t1_crtzqim,null,t1_crtzgby,null,null,null,1436689153,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

null,false,WakingWoes,null,null,null,"&gt; You were asked why you hunted. One of your responses was that it is good training for the dogs.

No, I didn't. I said that the process of training the hounds kills more foxes than the hunt does. Without the hunt, there would be no reason to train the dogs, which would lead to unsustainable numbers of foxes.

&gt;Foxhunting has little effect on fox populations. But it trains the foxhounds to hunt foxes, which has little effect on fox populations.

I really don't see why you're having so much difficulty understanding this. The Huntsman cares for the hounds on a permanent basis. One of his jobs is training them to follow a scent, and before the ban he would train them to kill the fox efficiently. This is what keeps fox populations down in roughly 2/3rds of the country.

So whilst the hunt may meet only semi-regularly, the hounds are always in training for the next meet. If foxhunting was banned outright, there would be no reason for the training of hounds to continue, leaving the population unchecked.

&gt;Or the fox could just be shot like my local farmers do?

And how do your local farmers find the foxes to shoot and chivvy them from their dens? They use beagles.

I think we actually have two halves of the team who are good at playing two different styles of football.

Our forwards are quick, technically well rounded players, who perform best when there is space in front of them: classic counter attack characteristics.

Our defense and keeper perform best when there is less pressure on them, and they have more time to limit mistakes: lending itself really to a high pressing game/high possession game.

The problem is how do we reconcile these and mould an effective team? I don't think we can counter attack effectively, for the simple fact that most teams will not allow space behind them, as they will park the bus and allow us possession.

I think we have to follow the Man City style of play: bring our ""wingers"" inside the centreback/fullback channels, and create overloads with our attacking fullbacks. They can then combine to get to the byline and attack with LOW crosses, which people like Sturridge/Sterling/Lallana/Hendo/Milner can attack.

We will need to monopolise possession with this approach, but the crucial part is that it has to be positive, rather than for it's own sake.

I think that 4-1-2-2-1 would work in this situation, with Lucas holding, Milner and Henderson acting as runners/passers, with Coutinho and Lallana behind Sturridge.

Yes indeed, I regularly visit my local falconry centre. I know much about raptors.

Firstly, such animals are extraordinarily rare to the point that the vast, vast majority of foxes will never, ever encounter or even see one.

Secondly, owls hunt with stealth; they do not pursue prey.

Thirdly, eagles hunt via surprise; they pursue prey incredibly rarely.

I'm not sure how this is a response. Culling an population control are acceptable. Violent blood sports are not. They are not the same thing.

Because you can literally see them still struggling.

Which phrases would those be? And don't spout your usual 'terrified animal is torn apart' - because remember that it was you that put those words in my mouth.

No. I'm completely against this too. I don't know what makes you think I would be.

With less money, because all the schools who don't need things like PRUs or SEN help have basically been doing the whole ""I'm alright Jack"" routine, so goodbye completely to their contributions.  I mean sure, there's definitely the argument that schools can do these things more efficiently than the local council, and to a certain extent that's probably true of a brain-dead maggot's left armpit, but schools don't have time for these sorts of thing.  Already there're headteachers now needing to take an active role in helping to set up these services, not because that's their job, or because they have skills in those areas, but because they care to much about the children they're trying to teach to watch as the whole thing goes to pot.

The worst thing is that this is going to make the local council less efficient rather than more.  I mean, if this streamlining really did help someone, I could understand the whole process.

A few teams have been linked with him so far this window but it looks like most teams are rather reluctant to pay that much.  I'm sure that Liverpool have inquired about him but unless he wants to go down some I wouldn't be surprised to see them pass.  

I don't know how important a winger is to them with Ibe, Markovic, Origi, Lallana, Milner, Sterling (?) Coutinho all vying for space in the side on the wings.  If they paid him that much every week he'd probably have to be a starter.  

I don't think that LFC are going to spend a lot this summer.  Striker, RB, back up GK and maybe a CM is what I see.  

The Arsenal rumors of trading Sterling for Gibbs and Walcott is pretty interesting.  It would probably be a good trade for everyone.  Walcott would likely be a striker in the system.  

Gibbs would probably start at LB and Moreno would go to RB which I know BR gets killed in this sub for playing players out of position but I think Moreno would be good on the right, his left foot is awesome and he could cut in like an inverted winger.  Usually he is ushered wide on the left making him either pass away from goal or put in a difficult cross.

You also need to consider that shelters are not safe for a number of people sleeping rough, due to past issues with other shelter residents. Where are they going to go, even if the shelters have capacity?

I would agree that chucking lots of money at the problem would solve a lot of issues, but this is the UK, where as recent elections show, people care more about themselves than the welfare of others, so it won't happen until the tide of squalor comes lapping at the doorsteps of the comfortable. Another things that would solve a lot of the issues is a change to drugs policy, but again that'll never win votes from the large number of people who haven't got the first clue about drugs, but know they just want to make the drugs issue go away and think legislation is something that works.

Your argument seems to boil down to society needing to have an unselfish and charitable outlook that rarely extends to anything that isn't fluffy or pretty, when it comes down to it. Again, I agree.

Anyway this point is moot, VAT registration is done by considering either historic turnover or expected turnover. Case 2 is not relevant here unless this person expects turnover to exceed VAT threshold in the next month, ie makes 82k of taxable sales in 1 month.

Case 1 is more relevant, it is done on a rolling 12 month basis so even if OP stops selling for 1 month, he'll still have to register in 2 months.

OP you sell second hand goods right? There is a scheme called the second hand margin scheme where you only pay VAT on the margin between selling and purchasing, rather than on total turnover.

It's denying your children a balanced diet and guaranteeing them an inflexible eating habit. Hell? My parents later realised that my vegetarian diet was harming me and swapped out. 

One of the major problems in India with starvation is due to a vegetarian diet. Veganism would exacerbate it as many children don't get enough protein, iron and calcium to the point that in many parts of India, anaemia is endemic. 

The NHS clearly states that children on vegan diets require medical supplements which indicates that vegan diets are insufficient and require medicine to actually work. Normal diets are hard enough to balance without simply amputating half the diet and children have it difficult enough in the real world without having to adopt a dietary choice that literally destroys any ability to travel or adjust.

I found advertising stimulating, and tried to convince myself it wasn't pointless and destructive. Sometimes I still try, but it's pretty hard. I have friends in finance, not one is crazy happy by going to work, take the money element out of it and they would all quit. Take the 'challenge' of outsmarting the competition (our other mates) and they would quit. Everyone is either taking boxing or going crazy on coke, the thought of escaping the City comes often, everyone has their 5m/50m fuck you money target, a few have cashed out, but they aren't as cynical as my adland peers. Of course I'm generalising here, one close friend is super happy on M&amp;A and when we talk about happiness, money, dining, traveling and partying is enough for now, then you question about the people that lost their jobs due to her deal and things get sort of interesting but dismissed, others would do the deal, she's happy she moved in first, besides, if people lose jobs, perhaps they weren't great to start with...it goes on.

And I disagree it's only Barcelona where he could have an impact because the opposition isn't focusing solely on him.

I mean we have Hazard and Costa on a good day. Willian centrally. As long as Sterling is willing to work back into the right position. It would be a really really good option. It doesn't add much to our first team, but it certainly creates a lot less of a problem when one of Willian or Hazard (and kind of Oscar) is missing. It would help our squad out but would leave no place for Cuadrado.

The main thing imo, is that we won't see a traditional 4-5-1 with both full backs pushing high and a wide expansive formation as long as week keep Terry and play a low line most of the time. That mainly expresses itself through also only pushing Ivanovic up first as the rest of our forwards all lack height. 

Anyway, tactically Sterling would work in our current system fairly well as long as he tracks back, he's hardly going to be worse than Cuadrado and would challenge Willian to the point he might just play centrally when Oscar is having his annual form drop.

null,false,WakingWoes,null,null,null,"&gt; Secondly, owls hunt with stealth; they do not pursue prey. Thirdly, eagles hunt via surprise; they pursue prey incredibly rarely.

If they fail to take their prey the first time, they continue attacking until they succeed, and no fox cub will stand still in that time. In a bird sanctuary, an owl is unlikely to pursue anything. In the wild, a Tawny is very likely to chase after an escaping fox cub or vole. 

&gt;Culling an population control are acceptable. Violent blood sports are not. They are not the same thing.

So in your mind, killing the animal is acceptable, but enjoying the process is not? There is no difference in suffering between shooting the fox and having the hounds take it, except for the certainty of the hounds and the uncertainty of the shot. 

&gt;Because you can literally see them still struggling.

It's likely that the hounds are responsible for that, or that the nervous system is causing convulsions. The fox is certainly dead, but if it isn't you should mention that to the Huntsman so he can better train the hounds.

&gt;I'm not depending on PETA for anything. 

Excepting your argument, of course. 

&gt;Which phrases would those be? 

""relentlessly hunting terrified foxes through the countryside""
""violently killing animals for sport""
""hunting purely for sport is vile""

&gt;The RSPCA, the world's largest animal welfare organisation say it isn't.But I'm sure that you'll claim that they're crazy, uneducated sabs because they don't agree with your opinion.

No, I'd say they're a charity who exist to care for animals. They'll never support the death of any animal even with solid reasoning. Thanks for trying to form my opinions for me, though.

&gt;No. I'm completely against this too. I don't know what makes you think I would be. There is also the fact that fish have vastly less mental capacity than foxes.

Fish don't feel pain, foxes don't feel fear; at least not in the way that humans do. I suppose you're a vegetarian? If so then congratulations for having the conviction to put your morals into action. 

&gt;Where they aren't, I and many others object.

See above.

&gt;Your argument here is that because there are other inhumane things, the inhumane thing that you do is OK.

No, I'm merely pointing out the hypocrisy of most of fox hunting's opposition. Whilst you might abstain from meat-eating or unethically sourced produce, the 75% statistic you produced most certainly do not. My argument is that the culling must happen anyway, and that deriving pleasure from the sport is not objectionable.

But of course it's better you did what you did and avoided a crash.

It happens all the time on the roads that people drive badly, and people who drive more carefully have to adjust to avoid the crash.

Imagine you are at a traffic light-controlled crossroads, and the light is green for you. A car going across you goes through the red. If you let it hit you as you go through the green, it's clearly the other car's fault, but it's better for you to avoid the accident and let it go.

With local knowledge, as here, I think one just learns to take extra care at 'bad' junctions.

Saddam's history as a brutal dictator is no justification. As I've said earlier he was a brutal dictator when he was our ally and other brutal dictators are still our allies. 

You might not have seen my edit regarding the UN. Could you address that?

You also dodge the WMDs hitting us in 45 mins thing repeatedly. Your selective rebuttals say a lot.


Edit - I wonder if, by your logic, an illegal act contravening the UN charter is justification for other UN members to act unilaterally (without UN security council approval) and invade?",null,0,null,1433331196,null,0,1433332171,0,cru111r,null,t3_387656,null,t1_cru111r,null,t1_cru0yyx,null,null,null,1436689973,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

I think there are more factors in play here than a clean left-right divide.  A lot of people who would position themselves in the left area of politics simply don't vote, for instance (and we should be looking at giving them reasons to feel re-enfranchised, not clubbing them over the head with more of the same).  And Labour were strung up in ways that aren't necessarily only going to wash with the right-wing (Labour crashed the economy, Labour will get in bed with the SNP, Labour are just Red Tories anyway, the list goes on…)

I don't doubt that we need to attract Tory voters to win (obviously).  I just think that a clearer, all-inclusive campaign goes a long way even before we start thinking about the ideological bend.  Let's face it, Labour didn't provide a clear message to the left _or_ the right _or_ the centre this year.",null,0,null,1433331272,null,0,false,0,cru11te,null,t3_389njh,null,t1_cru11te,null,t1_crtzvi2,null,null,null,1436690005,null,2,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,2,null
