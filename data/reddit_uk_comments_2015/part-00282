They don't even serve much of a military function since they were an extention of the World War 2 stategy of carpet-bombing civilian areas, and we don't engage with such tactics today since we prefer precision strikes.

I don't think it's ""outdated"" at all; Chelsea were the most dominant force in the prem last season and they use a holding midfielder like Matic or John Obi all the time. Guardiola's Barcelona is also regarded as one of modern football's greatest teams of all time and they used Busquets as a holding midfielder as well. Man City was so successful because they had Yaya Toure locking down the center of the pitch. Bayern Munich used Javi Martinez or Schweinsteiger. Madrid used Khedira. Juve has Vidal. You cannot ignore that all these great teams had/have something in common; they owed a lot of their success to having a *quality* holding midfielder. The position isn't *only* about defending per se. It's about controlling the game, dictating the pace, distributing, making long passes, organizing players around you and locking down the middle of the field aka the most important part. They're not flashy or dazzling offensive players like Pogba. Their primary job is still to defend, but, they are also tasked with keeping the entire team together and without them the team falls apart. The position is so crucial yet underrated because everyone gets distracted by the spectacle of flashy, pacey attackers these days and fail to appreciate how integral the holding midfielder is.

I think Ed almost got close to the narrative of offering a hopeful alternative with the One Nation Labour project, but it had all but fizzled out and disappeared by the time of the election.

Perhaps part of the problem was that we gave our own brand of doom and gloom by warning of the dangers of Tory government rather than really offering anything exciting as an alternative. The Tories we face today are very different to 1997, 2001, or 2005. They've been working hard to detoxify and have seized a lot of the Blairite ground, meaning simply warning of the danger they pose no longer works very well.

aaaand, from a Daily Mail article at the end of the 2013-14 season

&gt; Liverpool and Manchester United would have both received more than £70million extra in Premier League TV money had the cash been distributed based on audience.
&gt; Brendan Rodgers' side collected £97.5m in television money last season, the most in the Premier League, but they would have been in line for £172.3m if the distribution was based on the number of TV viewers - a difference of £74.8m.
&gt; Manchester United would have received £159.5m if the Premier League split their money more evenly based on UK audience. As it was, United picked up £89.1m, more than £70m less.

Apparently there were allegations of child abuse in Islington and he feels Corbyn didn't do enough? Is that right?

&gt;In his letter, Mr Mann claims that Mr Corbyn was contacted by abuse victims in the early 1990s and he promised to raise it with a health minister, but it was unclear it had done so.

What was unclear what had done so? Did he follow it up? Everything is either really vague or I have terrible reading comprehension.

Corbyn's answer;

&gt;A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: 'He called for an independent inquiry into child abuse in Islington at the time and has taken this strong line ever since.

&gt;'He has called for the terms of reference of any inquiry to cross local authority and international jurisdiction to ensure as thorough and wide ranging investigation as possible.


&gt;'He has commended the Home Secretary's intention to publish interim reports throughout the process.


&gt;'He has also proposed additional steps such as a standing commission.


&gt;'He has supported Islington Council working closely with the Home Office on these issues.'

In practice, they serve a few purposes. They're a pressure group and think tank that campaigns for Labour to take on policies around mutualism and syndicalism. They're also a major source of funding, being the main route into the movement for money from the big commercial co-ops (like the Cooperative Group). They use the money to sponsor MP and Council candidates who support their ideology, who get to run as Labour Cooperative candidates.

The example in this video, for example, is the New North Main Line which connects the Chiltern line to the Great Western main line at Old Oak Common in west London. How could a suburban rail line in west London be that unprofitable? Because alongside it, you've got the Central Line. Every station that the Parliamentary train can serve is already served every few minutes by a tube train which goes all the way into the parts of London where people want to go. There is really no public transport for the line to need to exist, other than for a few freight services and when they need to either turn a Great Western train around. However, reducing the legal status of the line to just allow those two uses costs more money than it costs to continue serving it. The cost of running this Parliamentary service is then offset by the fact that for other passenger trains to be able to use it once in a blue moon when they need it, they would still need to have their drivers trained on it, and for that to be the case there still need to be relatively regular services along it.

In this case, the Parliamentary service has only a couple of years to go before being closed. The track connection at Old Oak Common is being removed, and the line legally closed, as part of the HS2 project. Originally, HS2 was meant to surface west of the Old Oak Common station and take over the space used for these tracks, but over the years after the scheme was initially announced they decided to put more and more of it in tunnel until they reached the point where the entire thing will be in tunnel and it won't affect the NNML at all, aside from needing to sever the connection during the construction period.",null,0,null,1437679455,null,0,false,0,ctdpbpg,null,t3_3eb50f,null,t1_ctdpbpg,null,t1_ctdh0pa,null,null,null,1438129072,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

null,false,mooli,null,null,null,"&gt; The last 30 years. Seriously, do you have any evidence that the UK as a whole is interested in nationalisation of things? I appreciate the reddit echo chamber finds a lot of similar souls but the real world is quite different.

Well, [60% support the renationalisation of the railways](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/05/11/why-do-people-support-rail-nationalisation/), [70% think that government should be redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor, and support a 7% top rate of tax on those earning £1 million a year](http://classonline.org.uk/docs/YouGov-Class_Polling_Results_120522_Economic_Policies.pdf).

In fact, even among conservative voters it is popular - 42% for / 42% against rail renationalisation.

Indeed all the things that the original article mentions a Corbyn government might do actually seem to have huge popular support if you look at polls.

&gt; If they don't vote then surely that is their problem? There are left wing parties out there why dont they vote for them? It's not Labour or nothing.

Except that - under FPTP - in the vast majority of cases it really is Labour or nothing. I detest what the Labour party have become and only vote through them through gritted teeth because I live in a marginal constituency (that went Tory) and the alternative is so much worse for me. I would love to vote eg. Green without feeling like I'm handing the Tories a win. The reality of the system fosters cynicism and despair that anything will ever change, so people just don't bother voting - which plays right into the hands of the Conservatives, whose base always turns out to vote.

This is exactly what happened for many people in 2010 - the Lib Dems were riding high on an (allegedly) centre-left platform, and there was genuine optimism that they could actually use that momentum to get a Liberal/Labour coalition, with a promise of voting reform. Instead, FPTP scuppered much of the Lib Dem advance, and we got 5 years of Tory rule and the pathetically botched AV campaign. 


&gt; how would you feel about a Tory/UKIP government? That is a very likely outcome with PR-based systems.

I would feel terrible about it, but if that is genuinely representative of the voting proportion then I am still in favour of it. That UKIP can get as many votes as they did, and get on MP, is simply wrong. I'm in favour of fixing that, in spite of my loathing for UKIP.

However, that's not necessarily a likely outcome - tactical voting is rife, and a significant proportion of non-voters don't bother because they live in ""safe"" seats where they have zero influence on the outcome. Boundary reforms will only make this worse (or better, if you're a Tory).

&gt; There's no reason and little to suggest that the State is somehow more wonderful at provision of service than the private sector.

Oh I don't know, the history of privatization in the UK is a pretty shoddy one. The railways are a great example - once privatized, they cut back on maintenance to increase profits, and lo and behold scores of people died in avoidable accidents. 

I actually heard a Tory MP on the radio a while back arguing that we didn't really need inspection of schools or local authority oversight because parental choice will drive improvements, which is possibly the dumbest and most ideologically blinkered thing I've heard a politician say in relation to education.

&gt; [The wild land areas are the result of a three phase analysis.
Phase I applied GIS analysis to map the relative wildness of all of Scotland, using four physical attributes: perceived naturalness, rugged or challenging terrain, remoteness from public mechanised access, and visible lack of built development and other modern artefacts.
Phase II analysed the data to identify the largest and most wild areas (producing a long list of possible areas of wild land).
Phase III used informed judgement to select wild land, and define their extent.](http://www.snh.gov.uk/protecting-scotlands-nature/looking-after-landscapes/landscape-policy-and-guidance/wild-land/mapping/)

Is that single cherry picked example representative? When I first heard of these ghost trains the report gave the impression that the majority were on rural lines and that this was essentially a stealth round of Beeching-like cuts. The reporter took a ride on one, the whole thing was in the countryside, not some inner-London route already served by several other routes. 

&gt;  However, reducing the legal status of the line to just allow those two uses costs more money than it costs to continue serving it.

They seem to want to have their cake and eat it. By the sounds of it this line sees occasional use from re-routing due to maintenance etc so the ""ghost status"" is irrelevant. It seems there is an operational need to maintain that particular line regardless of its status in carrying regular scheduled passengers.

I'm pretty sure that the procedure for de-listing a passenger route would not include an absolute mandate that the lines need to be destroyed beyond use and not used for freight or any other purpose. The notion is nonsensical, the idea that they *need* to run ghost trains doesn't stand up to any scrutiny. They just want to avoid the bother and potential rejection risk of following the proper process of officially ending the passenger route status of the line. 

Do they receive subsidies for running any of these? That would not surprise me in the slightest. ",null,0,null,1437680821,null,0,false,0,ctdqa0j,null,t3_3eb50f,null,t1_ctdqa0j,null,t1_ctdpbpg,null,null,null,1438129748,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

null,false,atheistmil,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,null,"&gt; In fact, even among conservative voters it is popular - 42% for / 42% against rail renationalisation.

Give the cock up on privatising it this isn't too surprising, it has been a well documented failure in every form. But what about other services? That would be a truer litmus test of the desire to nationalise? 

&gt;  70% think that government should be redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor

We already do that, like I said many social policies have been a great success. We have a welfare system. Perhaps a better question would be to understand how far that redistribution should go?

&gt; and support a 7% top rate of tax on those earning £1 million a year.

56% not 70% support that, I agree popular but not quite a runway thing.

&gt;  Except that - under FPTP - in the vast majority of cases it really is Labour or nothing. 

I really dont buy that. We have had UKIP, the Green party and the SNP - admittedly in special circumstances - all gained MPs. Sure UKIP would have got more under PR  but they all go to show that you can have MPs from different parties should they get support.

Also, under any PR-like system I seriously doubt you'd get a socialist government, you'd probably get a centre-right coalition for most of the time. UKIP + Tories counted for a majority of the voting public and it's hard to see many of those wanting a left wing party.

&gt; tactical voting is rife, and a significant proportion of non-voters don't bother because they live in ""safe"" seats where they have zero influence on the outcome.

I doubt it is anywhere near the level that would make a left wing government more likely. And with so few seats getting over 50% of the vote anyone claiming to be in a safe seat is self-delusional. Perhaps if those ""silent lefties"" got out to vote there'd be a lot less safe seats. people have only themselves to blame.

&gt; The railways are a great example

You do realise that pre-war the entire network was privately owned and reasonably successful? It was nationalisation that killed rail in the first place followed by a botched privatisation in the 90s.

A lot of other industries have been privatised successfully.

This is mainly why I'm so indifferent when it comes to renewable energy, because unless primarily China gets its shit together we're pissing in the ocean and making next to no actual difference. 

Not to mention I think we should just go nuclear which is much much cheaper, provides more energy, more jobs, and just as little if not less waste (due to turbine/panel manufacturing methods). 

I am extremely impressed and surprised we're at 22% which is fantastic and amazing.

#

&gt;In August 2011, Samer Allawi, Al Jazeera's Afghanistan bureau chief, was arrested by Israeli authorities on charges of being a member of Hamas. Walied Al-Omary, Al Jazeera's bureau chief in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said the military court accused Allawi of making contact with members of Hamas's armed wing. A co-leader of The Committee to Protect Journalists said ""Israel must clarify why it continues to hold Samer Allawi."" 

&gt;Allawi was held in prison over a month, he was charged $1400 fine *after pleading guilty to having met with Hamas, a militant group seen as a terrorist group by Israel and most of the West*

null,false,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,null,"I'm going all out here and expecting an unexpected title challenge. Hear me out: 

1) there is no expectation -- last year we were attempting to live up to the impossible highs of the season before. Realistically, it was never going to happen, but having come so close to tasting glory, I'd imagine the players could feel the weight of pressure on their shoulders. No weight or pressure this season, just an expectation of finishing higher than 6th. 

2) not as much bedding in period -- we made loads of signings last summer, and most were from other leagues (Moreno, Markovic, Can, Manquillo, Balotelli). The players from the PL (Lallana, Lovren and Lambert) bedded in fairly fast but it was only Lallana that took to our system straight away. Lovren looked lost without Fonte by his side and Lambert didn't play all too much. 

3) no Gerrard -- don't get me wrong, I love Gerrard as much as anyone on this sub, but we can't deny that the end of the 13/14 season, and World Cup defeats, really broke the man and his confidence. He wasn't the same player last season, and it wasn't nice to see him like that. That was a sentiment shared by the whole squad, I feel: the hangover from the previous season, the severe come down from the best high. Lethargy took over. 

4) we have a striker who can actually score goals -- regardless of your opinion on Benteke, he's proven that he can score goals in this league. With better service, he could be our true saviour. 

5) we might get lucky with Studge -- I know he's out already, but we can't be as unlucky with him as we were last season. If he stays fit for 70% of the season, we know he'll score the goals that can get us up the top of the table. 

6) Finally...we look like a proper team -- pre-season isn't everything, and maybe we could have used a LB and DM, but we have a team that has good depth, players who are bedded in and some fantastic talent (Couts, Firmino, Lallana, Milner) and new goalscorers (Benteke, Ings).

With such a gifted young player, it's easy to see the future in place of the present.  

That said, I do think most users around here do recognize that he is not a sufficiently strong DM to play that role in a successful partnership.  

But he could certainly become so.  In a few years he may well be a magnificently complete midfielder capable of succeeding in any role he is assigned.  The question is, what role do we want him to grow into?  Pochettino could mold him into a defensive rock, but I'd prefer to see him focus more on the attacking side of his game, to compete with Mason rather than partner him.

Bottom line is that he and Mason often make mistakes as a pair.  I think they'll both be better this coming season, but I still think they're not really suited to partner each other (even though they are comrades).

Can't believe they're boasting about a million homes by 2020. That's 200,000/yr or 0.8% of the UK housing stock. They don't even say what measures that will be, it's hardly going to be whole house retrofit, probably just a few lofts and cavities here and there. 

The efficiency of the UK housing stock is a national disaster. That being said, I don't see any solution that doesn't involve 10's of £bn. There are no shortcuts to bringing an old home up to a modern standard of energy efficiency. I've seen some eye-watering costs of projects I've been involved with. Like £30-50,000 to save yourself £500-1000/yr. If it doesn't make economic sense in a sub 5yr timeframe. It won't happen without extensive government support. Which has just been withdrawn. 

I've spoken directly to some of the UK's leading experts on this topic. Looking for possible answers and solutions. I've come to the conclusion that the only way it's possible is to basically knock down everything built before about 1960. Chances of that whilst not even building enough to house our growing population is basically zero. So we're stuck with what we've got. 

The average person has no idea of the raw amount of energy required to heat an old home to what we now consider an acceptable standard. The peak gas demand in winter is 300GW. Which is about 5 times our entire installed electrical grid. 

We're already having problems whilst still paying 4p/kWh for gas. Those days won't last forever. Not to be pessimistic, but the future of life in the UK is appalling cold and damp for the vast majority. And there's nothing we can do about it.

&gt;While Al Jazeera has a large audience in the Middle East, the organization and the original Arabic channel in particular have taken criticism and been involved in several controversies.[109]

This is the first line. Why the need to mention Arabic channel? It implies that the non-Arabic language channels are not involved in several controversies. The list of controversies confirms this, it's mostly on Arabic version of the channel. Also, most of controversies are about countries taking action against Al-Jazeera Arabic whether justified or not.

The difference between Arabic and English version of Al-Jazeera are massive.The difference is big enough to treat both channels separately when considering reputation. One example is that a lot of journalists working for Al-Jazeera English are ex-BBC or other English news channel staff. This isn't the case with the Arabic version.

null,false,thrillerv,lfc55,,null,"* 1 - Benteke. I've said it a lot on here, I believe he will be an absolute hit for us. The #9 we've needed, he's going to have an incredible season. Goal worries are done as far as I'm concerned. I'm **extremely** confident about him. 

* 2 - Clyne. We haven't had a good RB since Johnson's decline, it's been years since we haven't had a weak link there. Fullbacks these days are thought to be rampant, marauding, crossers &amp; while he is more than adept in the opponent's half, he's a defender first and foremost. Something forgotten among too many FBs for my liking. 

* 3 - Milner. The experience we needed. A pro's pro. I'm excited about the partnership of Hendo-Milner in the middle, but on the flipside, I also hope he doesn't have to exclusively play in the middle. I'd like to see him on the wing here and there too b/c he's excelled there over the past couple years &amp; could allow Coutinho to play deeper, which is where I enjoy watching him most. 

* 4 - Firmino. I'm not entirely convinced whether he'll be a hit with us as I am with the aforementioned names, but he's the most exciting behind Benteke for me. I think he has the potential to bring that star quality to us, but him being this low is not so much about him but more so about how great our other signings have been &amp; how necessary they were in filling gaping holes. 

* 5 - Ings. Seems like he's got that Henderson/Suarez type determination. He strikes me as the type who always has a chip on his shoulder, just look at the struggles he had early in his career &amp; where he is now, says it all really. Just turned 23, eager, exciting, hard working. His movement is great &amp; he'll feed off our MF, a great rotational ST to have. 

* 6 - Gomez. Even before preseason, I did quite a bit of reading up on him, highlights, anything I could get on &amp; something about him clicked. I had a strangely optimistic feeling about him. Preseason has done nothing but added to that optimism. I genuinely think he'll have a bright future w/ us. Composed, technically astute, physically ahead of his years &amp; from his interviews &amp; others' quotes, seems a very level headed, ambitious young man. 

* 7 - Bogdan. I've heard some say they think he'll be our #1 GK by the end of the season. I doubt it, I love post-nervous breakdown Mignolet. Everything you want from a GK, he had in the second half of the season. So his kicking isn't great, alright, I can settle with that so long as he pulls off those incredible saves. 

Not counting Origi, since he was bought last year. I'm excited to see him develop though, I've been disappointed to see how many people have seemingly written him off just based off his preseason. Kind of silly tbh, he's just turned 20. 

Honestly, all of these guys really fucking excite me. Sorry for the wall of text, just too much hype on my part, can't wait to fuck up Stoke.

Not at all, it's fair enough to want some backing up of claims. That said, I'm not exactly a supporter of hers so I won't be as completely familiar with her policies (or maybe focuses would be a better word at this point) as Corbyn's, but there are a few that stood out to me.

- Focusing on education and trying to fund it without micromanagement. She offers some support for work of the Tories with free schools etc but I get the impression that she'll empower Ofsted also. She would also maintain tuition fees as they currently are.

- Supporting small business (and broadly business as well). This one has actually been disappointingly vague for me given how often she mentions it. She's got the support of the other 'financially responsible' members of the Party like Umunna and Hunt and seems to be on board with keep the low taxes and incentives that are currently in place for business.

- She wants to stay in the EU and seems to want address Islamic extremism and Russia using that stage. I believe she's also said that Labour should rescind its support (or should not have supported it in the first place anyway) of Palestine's recognition as a state.

- She's put some focus increasing efficiency in public services. Obviously, it's something everyone would like, but she's the only one I can remember saying anything about it. My mum actually has some experience with her through Kendall addressing her at a few speeches for work and she does seem to have something of a passion for social care (bear in mind this last bit is purely based of my mum's impressions, I wouldn't take it as anything more than an aside).

- She backs the 2% defence spending target. Lots of talk of weakening the country and becoming meek on the world stage.

Now this is just what I have garnered and I've tried to keep it as non-biased as possible.

I mainly think it's too early for her and, as much as I wish it wasn't true, leadership qualities are very important and need to be at a higher level then she currently has shown. As I say, I don't agree with quite a lot, but I'd feel better supporting someone that I often disagree with if I know where they stand than Andy fucking Burnham.",null,0,null,1437686682,null,0,false,0,ctduan4,null,t3_3echjk,null,t1_ctduan4,null,t1_ctdrm38,null,null,null,1440464231,null,4,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,4,null

**The whole point of polling is that it's unfortunately the best way of judging public opinion. It's far from perfect and polls can vary in their validity and accuracy, but again, what else is there? Maybe you know of something better? (That was my point...)**

However, what you seem to be doing is discounting someone's argument by saying their evidence is poor, without suggesting anything better when pressed. Then you call out assumptions (to which they at least claim to have some evidence for) and **then** make your own counter assumption without anything to back it up, which makes you look rather silly.

So do you actually have anything to add to the discussion because I'm really tired of people on Reddit who use critical thinking as some sort of cheap device to pick holes in people's arguments without any respect to it in their own discussion.

It's worth noting that predictions say that the average life expectancy of people born in the UK today is 100 years.

I'll try an annuity calculator. I'd originally discounted it as I was hoping to have most of my investment in ISAs and pension (so I can take a lump sum) so I can pass it onto my children.

null,false,Sir_Bantersaurus,null,null,null,"&gt; Not sure I agree with this too. 74% of the people able to vote did not vote Tory. That is easily enough people to convince without convincing any Tories.

I think it's dangerous to assume that people who don't vote this time will vote next time. The idea is that someone could motivate them to turn out but that assumes the reason they didn't vote was because they disillusioned with the political system. /r/UnitedKingdom has taken that theory to heart. However in my personal, albeit statistically useless, experience there are a lot of people who simply don't care about politics. It's not that we can't reach them or that they have fallen off the path. It's that they don't care. Any attempts to make care won't work because they're not listening to you. Why? Because they don't care. 

There will also be a number of people who don't vote because they're in a safe seat and their candidate will win.

I think people overestimate how many possible voters are in that group of non-voters. I think their also overestimating how many in that former group will turn out for Labour over the Tories too. 

&gt; I think the only argument supported by this article is that social media gave us a false impression of how the election would pan out.

This was because people assume their arguments are more popular than they are. The danger is that this is prevented the left articling an argument that resonates with the wider electorate because they're only exposed to people like themselves. 

I think this line best sums up my feelings on the issue:

&gt; The American writer Matt Bruenig calls this “purity leftism”. As he wrote in 2012, “When purity leftists do actions and organising, their interest is not in reducing oppression as much as it is in reducing their own participation in it. Above all else, they want to be able to say that they are not oppressing, not that oppression has ended.”

I think a lot of people on the left lack the stomach to make painful concessions to get some of the things they want.

You don't really need to worry about waste with a long half life as it isn't particularly radioactive. The nasty stuff is that which decays in less time than it takes to exit your body if you were to ingest it, such as iodine isotopes. Then again being highly radioactive it means it has a short half life so you don't need to worry about it for a long timeframe.

A good analogy is getting rid of a litre of water with either a bucket or a dripping tap. If you empty the bucket over yourself at once you'll get drenched instantly whereas if you stand under a dripping tap you'll barely get wet at all but it will take a lot longer for the water to run out.

Proof of this? Also, consider that Al Jazeera was only founded in 1996. So is there any proof of similar age news sources having more controversies than Al Jazeera?

&gt;This is the first line. Why the need to mention Arabic channel? It implies that the non-Arabic language channels are not involved in several controversies.

Nah, that's just a persecution complex.  We both know this isn't true. 

&gt; The list of controversies confirms this, it's mostly on Arabic version of the channel. Also, most of controversies are about countries taking action against Al-Jazeera Arabic whether justified or not.

The point is Al Jazeera (English or Arabic) has controversies and imo is not trustworthy. 

&gt;The difference between Arabic and English version of Al-Jazeera are massive.The difference is big enough to treat both channels separately when considering reputation. One example is that a lot of journalists working for Al-Jazeera English are ex-BBC or other English news channel staff. This isn't the case with the Arabic version.

They are all under the Al Jazeera name. I personally believe they should therefore all hold the same standards.

Finally, a lot of those arguments are basically flawed and the deceit has been spread by the Tories and the press for years. Maybe we can persuade people of the truth in these matters.

Load factor is still the main weakness. Having an energy source only function 25% of the time is pretty poor. I'm all for ""renewable"" sources but we also need to back them up with something that can keep constant high output.

These two have special functions in rituals and their sons can never become kings. The first wife must be a member of the Matsebula clan, the second of the Motsa clan. These wives are known as tesulamsiti.

&gt; In traditional Swazi culture, the king is expected to marry a woman from every clan in order to cement relationships with each part of Swaziland. This means that the king must have many wives.

Next step is to contact the estate agent or whomever is managing the property. Remember if it isn't written down it didn't happen. So make sure all is written down and communication is via email only. Tell them if they call you, specifically you would like all communication via email and send them an email to that effect.

If that doesn't get any immediate response next step is to contact the council. They will come and inspect the property and if it's not in a safe state, that landlord is going to get his ass handed to him. You are going to be asked to move out ASAP. They won't allow you to stay in unfit property.

I would also very strongly recommend you check where your deposit is and request the details for the deposit protection scheme it is with. They have to provide you with this by law. If they haven't put your deposit in the right place they are liable for several times the amount.

Withholding rent can be used and is a bit of a last ditch effort. I wouldn't recommend it as a first step. They cannot just chuck you out (no matter what they threaten) if you don't pay it.

I've been spreading the no DM idea for a while now, so this is my 2 cents. The players who are definitely starters are Hendo, Milner, Benteke, Coutinho, and a back 4. we're gonna have kamikaze right and left back to get us more width. The best formation that brings the best out of everyone is having milner and hendo play behind Coutinho and those three behind another three(Benteke, Lallana, someone else). Coutinho is our best player and he plays best behind a front three. What will then happen is Hendo and Milner take turns pushing while the other stays back. The only thing Lucas brings is that he would always stay back while the other (Hendo) pushes. Now lets say you think Coutinho should be in the front three, That means you have lucas behind Milner and Hendo, and Coutinho up top with Benteke and Lallana/Firmino/other forwards. The problem with this is you're dropping lallana/Firmino for the added benefit of allowing Hendo and Milner to push all the time. Please realize, in a counter attack, you're assuming a defense of Hendo and milner will push all the time, but in actuality they will take turns. While not in the counter attack we'll have people who are not as good as Lucas, but to be honest we don't need them too because the team would be better.

The reason is, landlords - being kind hearted money driven souls, are already charging market rates. It's not like they set their rent based on their mortgage and yields... They set rent at whatever the maximum is they can get from their local market, and THEN calculate the yield for posterity. So they can't just increase prices by say 5% because their local markets won't handle those increases. They'll start losing tenants. You could argue ""what if they all do it""... But what you'll find in those situations is people start condensing into flatshares. 

Basically landlords are hostage to the market as much as anyone else, and this talk of just increasing prices is simplistic. few will be able to increase their prices by the amount they get in tax relief. Perhaps more importantly, it's a sign that the government (and by extension the taxman) has become interested in their incredible profits (largely by capital gains).

null,false,Monztaa,lfc68,,null,"I'm not sure if this was a retort to me, because if it was then I just want to clarify that I never suggested that the holding midfielder role is outdated, just that there is a preference for most managers nowadays to angle towards players that can attack and defend to a good demand rather than do one of those aspects to a really high degree.

Every so often, you find a blossoming manager that comes out of no-where and they achieve some remarkable feats. Rafa with Valencia, Mourinho with Porto, Klopp with Dortmund and Simeone with Atletico. They all have one thing in common, in that they both believe in having specialist positions, that having one footballer who can do one thing to a superb degree is better than having someone who can do multiple things to a fairly good degree. Sacchi and Rodgers disagree.

Rodgers is like Sacchi. He wants all the midfielders to be able to play any role in the midfield at any time. Gerrard is not a defensive midfielder for example. But he can turn, get the ball, and ping long balls and through balls like a number 10 would. Henderson is a workaholic, he'll press and hassle you until you lose the ball, but Rodger uses him as a forward runner (sometimes as a dummy runner as well). Rodgers wants Henderson to run, dribble and take shots like a number 10 would.

Rodgers wants those types of midfielders. However, like I suspected when he first came, to do that you need lots of money, because players that fit into that way are of Pogba calibre, one who is a very good all rounder. Not just attacking or defending, but both. Or you need a well oiled and functioning youth system to supply you with it.
It's hard to find players that are adept and fit into Rodgers' way. That's why Rafa's way was easier. You can find pure defensive midfielders (Mascherano) and pure attacking midfielders (Gerrard) and a specialist forward (Torres).

I've always said that Rodgers should stick with 3-4-3 for the defensive solidarity it gives him but the 3-4-3 is a lot better with specialist players rather than all-rounders. Unless you have tons of money to spend, it's difficult to acquire them. You have to be really good in the transfer market as well, which we are not.
That's why Milner is good. Because you ask him to defend, he will defend. You ask him to link up, he will do so. You ask him to create or score, he can do that to a capable standard as well. Ditto with Can. He can be used in Midfield or in defence. He pops up with goals and assists too.

Rodgers believes a player should have more than one skill set, but those types of players are hard to come by, even harder if you don't have the money to do so. That's one gripe I have with Rodgers, in that it took him a long time to figure out that Lucas would be very beneficial to our team. The defensive solidarity he gives is invaluable. Don't get me wrong, it's a great ideal to have, but unless you have a lot of money, you're not going to find players that are superb in one thing and very good in another. It's normally superb in one thing, average in the others - and that for Rodgers isn't acceptable.

If we throw talent aside, if Rodgers could buy either Pogba or Matic, he would choose Pogba simply because Pogba has more than one skill set in that he can attack and defend to a good degree than Matic, who is purely a defensive player. The players you've mentioned are/were world class players, and they had multiple skill sets that were very very good. But for teams like Rafa's Valencia/Liverpool, Klopp's Dortmund, Mourinho's Porto and Simeone's Atletico, they acknowledge that they couldn't get these multiple great attributes players because they are rare and cost a lot and set about with the specialist position.",null,0,null,1437688496,null,0,false,0,ctdvhqv,null,t3_3ec1f9,null,t1_ctdvhqv,null,t1_ctdo4my,null,null,null,1440046018,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

Also, there are two big facts about the '97 cohort that you need to take into account. Firstly, that vote came after 18 years of Tory rule. After that long with any one party, the grass is always going to look a lot greener on the other side. *Of course* centrists and some on the center right were prepared to give Labour a chance. *Of course* in 2012, after 13 years of Labour, and only two years of the Tories, some of them have switched back. Secondly, they are all 15 years older by 2012 - their incomes are higher, they are more likely to own property, etc etc. It's pretty well documented that [people tend to get more conservative with age](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/07/you-are-probably-becoming-more-conservative). Given these two factors, '97 deserters are going to be some of the most difficult voters for Labour to win back - and why focus on them when, as the polls at that time showed, a win is possible without them?

Can we stop fetishising '97 and the Blair years as if they contain some kind of unique magical formula for winning? Not only has the political landscape changed immeasurably since then, rendering comparative analysis much less fruitful, but Labour had a significant lead in public support for much of the last parliament.

Thankfully, as ever Wikipedia has a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_train#Examples_of_extant_.22parliamentary.22_trains) of most, if not all, of the Parliamentary services in Great Britain with descriptive notes on each. For example, the Dearne Valley line service is Parliamentary, but the only truly Parliamentary station on the line is Pontefract Baghill, which is the third and least convenient passenger station in Pontefract. All other stations have other services which take people to where they want to go.

The number of rail passengers is growing faster and faster than anyone in the industry had anticipated, with new stations opened, old ones reopened and even old lines reopened across the country.

Thing i've noticed is you often here stuff like ""TORY SCUM"" and ""Fuck the tories and anyone who voted for them is a cunt"" etc etc but you rarely hear people saying ""LEFT/LABOUR SCUM"" or the equivalent. 

Its just weird to see so many politically fuelled personal attacks from the left directed towards the right but you rarely here them the other way. Sure the right can be unaccomodating but its to the point of dismissing the left as a bit immature or stupid rather than going after them personally.

You're right about the papers in general being right leaning but thats the way it happens to fall, in a parallel universe murdoch would be leftist. It does however stovepipe left leaning ideals in to a single place where it quickly produces a rather echoey chamber for example The Guardian is probably the most Left leaning paper whilst still having some journalistic ability but even the readership of that is obscenely biased (more so than any other paper) and you can just shitpost guardian links in /r/uk and have them go to the top",null,0,null,1437689636,null,0,false,0,ctdw7n6,null,t3_3ed51k,null,t1_ctdw7n6,null,t1_ctduogd,null,null,null,1440046357,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

Go read [Salman Rushdie's Guardian piece today](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/23/salman-rushdie-on-islam-we-have-learned-the-wrong-lessons) about the stupidity of the Islamophobia meme.

&gt;The novelist told the French magazine that he believes “we are living in the darkest time I have ever known”, with the rise of Islamic State of “colossal importance for the future of the world”. He argued that the taboo surrounding “supposed ‘Islamophobia’” must be brought to an end.

Not even necessary. You could simply ignore any controversies before 1996 when comparing. After 1996 would be good enough as an comparison point, not perfect but good enough.

From [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera_controversies_and_criticism), AJ has ~ 30 controversies and criticism. They're not even all controversies and not even all the controversies are valid - e.g. being accused of flouting Bahrain's laws when reporting on the poverty in that country.

Let's start with American news:

[CNN news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_controversies) has ~50 and a lot of it is condensed into single issue.

[Fox News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel_controversies) (Yeah I know, but gotta to list 'em) has way more than 50 and I stopped counting.

As far as I could find, only MSNBC news has controversial page bar to the above.

Now, onto British news:

BBC has WAY more [controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_BBC) and [criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_controversies) combined than AJ.

It seems that BBC is only the one with controversies page.

You need to consider the fact most English based news media are based in countries where free speech is highly regarded. A lot of AJ's controversies revolve around governments of heavily free speech restricted countries shutting it down when it doesn't like what they reported.

Lastly, if you consider AJA and AJE as one, then you should consider CNN news belonging to TBS, Fox to 21st Century Fox, etc which has loads of news channels, newspapers, etc which has all sorts of controversies attached.

&gt;Nah, that's just a persecution complex. We both know this isn't true.

Not at all. You know how wikipedia works. If you put a filler that doesn't mean anything except to increase word count, it'll get removed. If it's there, it's there for a reason especially on more popular pages.

&gt;The point is Al Jazeera (English or Arabic) has controversies and imo is not trustworthy. 

Then you should consider all the popular news channels mentioned in this post so far to be not trustworthy as I have shown they have far more controversies.

&gt;I'd like you to answer why has Al Jazeera done this? A clear and open bias that shows their true colours? I think so.

This was on Al-Jazeera Arabic news. IIRC Al-Jazeera English showed no bias in this case.

OK.  Good for you?

&gt; Not political point scoring and generalised attacks on a singular conceptualsation of Islam.

Virtually ALL of this Islamophobia nonsense comes from the left.  I should know  I'm on the left myself.  I'm not point-scoring here.  I'm speaking what I think is the truth.

&gt;The fact that someone can have a very good standard of oiving in the UK compared to other places in the world doesn't excluse the existence of discrimination .

What discrimination?  Muslims aren't being discriminated against.  They have every opportunity that everyone else has!

&gt;Yes. islamophobia does exist. criticising Islam is not Islamophobia.

So why dear God do they call it Islamophobia?  And why do muslims complain of Islamophobia whenever their religion is criticized?  

&gt;When I think of the term ""islamophobia"" I think about people setting fires to mosques and leaving pigs heads out of them

And how often does this sort of thing happen?  Not very.  And when it does happen, there is *outrage* and the police do everything they help, and if the perpetrators are caught, then they are prosecuted.

Again - the UK is just about the most tolerant nation in the world.  It is *not* a nation of far-right bigots - much as the more paranoid left make it out to be sometimes.  

&gt;I'm not getting into a genralised debate with you about islam, the left, or whatever.

- walk over bridge of sighs to cross river, head straight

null,false,hexapodium,null,null,null,"If you're a practicing lawyer in the UK (I'm not, by the way), you *really* need to stop dispensing something that could be considered specific legal advice to strangers on the internet, because at the very least you are probably voiding your professional liability insurance by doing so, even if you are fully correct on the points of law. If you're under the aegis of the SRA then you're dancing on the edge of their handbook, and if you're a barrister then I have literally no idea how  you could be commenting about this sort of thing without alarm bells going off in your head (and, because barristers are barristers, without citing about twelve interesting cases). 

On the point at hand: being under the influence is not evidence of (criminal) possession because there are trivially reasonable ways to doubt that someone under the influence had actual possession of drugs: a good lawyer could even argue that something like coke or heroin was not ""in possession"" if their client might have taken them at the urging of a third party who provided them, and so did not have exclusive or joint actual control of the drugs at any point until they were in their nose or vein. Something like weed is even easier since it can be trivially argued that someone was in the room with other people who were sparked up, and thus got a passive buzz. For things like MDMA, if there is no other evidence, it can be argued that the client didn't know that the drug they had was a controlled substance rather than something legal. All of these are somewhat implausible, yes, but they are not *unreasonable* and that's the relevant standard here. 

As this is a criminal matter, the reasonable doubt standard applies and so it's evidentially meaningless to bring up the fact that someone was under the influence, since it doesn't help establish the fact of possession. What *is* evidence of possession, is *actual possession* which is why we see the zero (possession) cases brought on the basis of some drugs someone had in the past and then took, and more than zero cases brought on the basis of drugs someone has in consumable form when they are searched or a warrant is executed. More broadly in the UK we don't see many cases brought on simple possession charges *anyway*, partly because the intent-to-supply limits are often very low and set without much regard for how much an average user will keep in their stash, and partly because making a simple possession charge stick is not that easy (for the reasons set out above) in proportion to the public benefit and rarely worth the bother for the CPS.

null,false,Combinho,eng-Surrey,Surrey/London,null,"A very interesting interview, and I feel that it shines a light on the popularity of UKIP as well. Both Owen Jones and Douglas Carswell identify the same problems that affect our society at the moment, but offer diametrically opposed solutions. Whilst I am very close to Owen in my political beliefs, I have plenty of time for Carswell because of this.

I think that it goes to show, that the election, and politics in general, is no longer a left vs right paradigm. Instead, it feels to me that it is about change vs the status quo. As such, UKIP were the party that identified our issues the best, and so won public support, whereas the Tories and Labour reinforced the status quo. 

Thus, my conclusion is that Labour's problem is not one of being too left or right wing, but of being a part of the establishment, and as such not connecting with those who feel left behind and disenfranchised. If Labour is to win power again, as I would prefer, it needs to step away from the left vs right paradigm, and instead identify the problems which affect real people, and put forward a coherent vision of how to change this.

It's not about simply opposing cuts to the working poor, but about acknowledging that the levels of reliance on benefits are a problem, and putting forward a vision of a high-skilled, high-wage workforce. Not attacking the poor or defending benefits out of a knee-jerk reaction, but offering an alternative third way.

It is interesting to look back on how the goal posts of what is defined as *Socialism* have shifted. You don't need to go back too far in time to find a state of affairs where concepts such as national healthcare, maximum working hours, pensions, *equal pay for equal work*, collective bargaining, equality and the separation of church and state.

Look back half a Century and you'd find a sizeable part of the political establishment struggling to approve many of the above aspects. Look back a whole Century, and they'd be vehemently opposed to nearly all of the above. And yet at present they are, to varying degrees, defining characteristics of Western society.

For some it is convenient to use the *Democratic Socialist Republic of Somewhere-or-Other* as a strawman to indicate that ""Socialism is bad"". Yet socialism's greatest influences and changes didn't need a state to start flying the red banner and adopt* the Internationale* as its anthem. 

Thus the successes of socialism are closer to home than we often think. ",null,0,null,1437694446,null,0,false,0,ctdz2f6,null,t3_3ebmus,null,t1_ctdz2f6,null,t1_ctdv9l7,null,null,null,1440047703,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

I'm extremely wary of the concept of things being self-evident generally. What is obvious to one person may not be to another, and as such everything should be given some degree of justification. Of course, I am not demanding that you do this now, I am simply stating that I can't accept anything as ""self-evident"", I need to understand where it comes from.

As for all that Snowden stuff, I got so fed up of reddit talking about it that my eyes just glaze over (is that the right phrase?) whenever it is mentioned. My basic understanding is that there are some very serious concerns, but it's impossible to separate those from the reactionary ""NSA is literally Hitler"" type stuff that reddit spouts. I should probably try and find some sort of unbiased, purely factual summary of all of that stuff. I also have the tendency on reddit that when politics is being discussed, I ignore any link to a website that sounds like biased niche-blog-news type stuff (I've never really thought about classifying exactly what stuff I ignore before, so that's the best description I can give I'm afraid). On an individual basis, this makes me a bit of a dick for just dismissing you outright like that, and I feel kind of bad. Realistically though, so much bullshit gets posted on those kinds of sites, and there's just so much text to read through, and...

I have a tendency to go off on a tangent and start ""typing aloud"" my thoughts like this. On another such tangent, it would be really interesting to see some studies on possible connections between personality and political views. I'm really not capable of concentrating on discussing one topic today am I? Why is that? Perhaps it's because I need food.

Anyway, in an attempt to return to your comment:

&gt;unless you're saying it's all faked

I am not saying it's all faked. I *am* saying I find it extremely difficult to believe that the security services rig polls. Surely if the security services had been found to be rigging polls, and the evidence was sound, this would be reported in the mainstream media? I don't ever remember this specifically being reported. Maybe I was living under a rock, who knows.

They all follow a similar format - the Labour party's members, being the stupid children they are, must be scolded and bullied back into accepting a ""realistic"" and ""electable"" position - ie a pro-cuts, pro-austerity, pro-war, anti-welfare, anti-trade union position that's ideologically exactly the same as the Tory party's position but with a slight pink twinge. This follows on from 3 seperate articles published in the Guardian in the space of a few hours today attacking Jeremy Corbyn in the most withering terms possible. You have [this](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/23/jeremy-corbyn-win-could-cause-sdp-style-labour-split-says-donor) pretending to be a news story, with [ultra-rich Oxbridge twat](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10310722/Rich-private-school-Oxford.-Meet-John-Mills-Labours-biggest-donor.html) John Mills threatening to bankrupt the party if the Labour members don't fall in line and do as their masters instruct, you have [this](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/23/labour-back-from-brink-unity) atonishingly insulting piece from Martin Kettle and Anne Perkins has shat out [this](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/23/jeremy-corbyn-understand-labour-new-members-change-party-fortunes) abomination. On top of that you have Tony Blair coming out attacking Corbyn and you have a Labour MP John Mann writing a letter accusing Corbyn of being complicit in covering up peadophilia in the 1980's ( one can't help but wonder where his principled objection to sexual abuse was in regards to Rotherham over the last few years, but I digress...) This is just the last 48 hours, if you go back a few more days you can find even more nonsense including people being called morons for daring to choose anyone who's not a Blairite Tory-lite careerist and instead having the temerity to pick a principled and articulate left-winger who believes passionately in socialism and the values of the Labour party. Madness!

What we have here is the left-wing of the British establishment closing ranks and trying to discipline the Labour party's membership. If you ever thought the media existed to be a check on those in power, rather than nakedly partisan propaganda to further the interests of those in power, then the last few years in British politics have been a revelation. We had Project Fear in Scotland, where all the political parties and newspapers put their superficial differences to one side to campaign for their shared class interests against the Scots, and using the most brutal combination of fear-mongering, lies and intimidation to secure the result they wanted. As a result the Labour party could no longer pretend to be an opposition party that differed in any significant way from the Tories, and they were subsequently smashed to bits. Then we had the General Election, where the media campaign to attack Miliband was frantic and sunk the British media to new depths. All pretence of objectivity was discarded with as the vested interests who run the country, including a lot of Blairites who were against the idea of Miliband winning the election, used fear of Scotland, whipping up of hatred against the unemployed, the disabled, immigrants, muslims and other undesirables, to get the blue-rinse pensioner brigade who make up the most important electoral demographic to vote. Fear is the only political currency that exists in Britain. Fear is the only thing that be relied upon to keep people in line. Fear is the only motivator to get people to participate in the performative ritual of voting in what is increasingly becoming a post-democratic state. The EU referendum will see another big dose of fear ""sell your sovereignty to an unelected German-led institution or *lose your job/pension*"" all the newspapers, in unison, will cry with the possible exception of the Express. Both major parties, all the papers, will drop their ostensible differences and unite around their shared class interests and their commitment to manufacturing consent. We already had Obama directly trying to interfere with a referendum in a sovereign nation tonight, and that's just the start. Get ready for another dose of Fear. This is just another tale in that sorry saga.

By the way I recommend doing the Furka pass and stopping to walk into the glacier cave! I did that today and it was amazing. I was literally riding over and through clouds. I also recommend going to Zermatt (but park your bikes in nearby Tasch and get the train, vehicles aren't allowed in) and going up the Matterhorn. Just hope that the weather is clear. There's also the Jungfraujoch train. I planned to do it but it's expensive and the weather has been too cloudy.

Col de l'iseran is also a great pass and is the tallest paved road in Europe.

I'll hopefully be making my way through the Stelvio pass tomorrow.

The Troubles is history but recent enough and significant enough to warrant more detail and time than, let's say, the crusades because someone who knows very little about the crusades is better able to function in modern day society here than someone who has no idea what the Troubles were.

&gt; If the UK was concerned about teaching students about current issues via their history classes, every king before Elizabeth I would be mentioned in passing instead of covered extensively.

They don't cover every king before Elizabeth extensively. Just the important ones that particularly shaped the UK that exists today.

Get your fucking head out of Washington's poxy arse. The American Revolution gets as much coverage as it warrants.

We know about Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, the thirteen colonies, the minutemen, the declaration of independence and all that jazz. It's all covered fairly short and quickly without much detail because no one cares enough about how they did it only that it happened.

On top of that, I don't think you realise, your culture seeps everywhere. You pick up plenty about the details of the American Revolution through references in your own media.

And you'd think if the Brits won't teach it because they lost then the Irish would love to teach it because they didn't lose and it gave a boost for independence. But no. I did history in the south. It was one small chapter in the massive world history book at the Junior cert level(ages 12 to 15 or so) and of course less than the troubles got. Because it wasn't important enough.

null,false,strolls,null,null,null,"Well, the reason I asked that is that you wrote a lot of things which are solid basic economics.

Folks that regurgitate basic economics in political debates on Reddit frequently appear not to have paid attention in the first class of term, in which it was explained ""as economists, we don't make any moral judgements - we just study economies. If the forester sells some wood to the carpenter, or we talk about the commodity grain market, we don't ask how the forester came to own the woodland, or if the grain farmers stole the land from an indigenous tribe. When we study the spending habits of the rich and the poor, we don't, as economists, say 'that's not fair'.""

Additionally, the basic models that economists talk about are just that - *models*. The purpose of them is to develop an idea - such as supply and demand - and then to go out into the world and see where reality defies the theory. Then we adjust the model.

I think you just described [trickle-down economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics), and it's not clear to me that [trickle-down economics is proven.](http://qz.com/429487/a-new-imf-study-debunks-trickle-down-economics/) That's one thing about science - these assumptions that appear to ""make perfect sense"" often turn out to be wrong.

There's certainly no such thing as a free market, at least not in the way that many redditors imagine it. [prize_winning_economist.pdf](http://theorwellprize.co.uk/wp-content/files_mf/hajoonchang.pdf) 

So if someone is earning a higher income - my ""flat amount paid is much higher"", as you say - then it's probably because society has facilitated that in some way. And higher taxes in return are probably perfectly fair. 

This comment is a bit disorganised - the first thing I opened with was how ""that's not fair"" is not the role of economics. Now I shall return to fairness - not the role of economists, it is instead the job of government and politics.

We are, when we discuss politics, allowed to say ""it's totally immoral that those [rent-seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) fuckers should live a life of ease of the back of our labour"".

We do not elect our parliament ""to advise the king"", or whatever it says in the magna carta - the purpose of a modern democracy is to meet the common needs of the people.

When the French and Russians were beheading their aristocracy, we were given the vote in exchange for our compliance. But the peasants were not revolting simply to vote for which baron would become king - they were rioting rather because they wanted an end to the whole system of hereditary inequality.

We give people free money all the time - but only the right kind of people. Every day our state gives money to those who happened to win the lottery of life, who were born to rich parents, and if you understand what property is (most people assume they already know) then you will realise that there's [no moral reason why it shouldn't be distributed more evenly.](http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson?language=en)

Wealth inequality and social mobility are indeed two different things, but they seem to be fairly well-coupled, and it would be quite dubious to pick out a single thing, like grammar schools, and say ""that's the cause of all of it"". 

Libertarians like to make out that the contract between Tesco and the shelf-stacker is a voluntary contract which both parties have entered into freely. This is not true - the shelf-stacker only took employment because he'd be evicted if he didn't. The state enforces the landlord's ""ownership"" of the shelf-stacker's home, and will evict him if he doesn't play ball. In politics we are totally entitled to question the legitimacy of these arrangements, in a way that first-year economists (supposedly) are not.

File all the important docs away immediately.

If it's a new build, check to see if it's got any warranty period (forget the name) still to go. Our house has a NHBC policy attached to it still, so if something goes wrong because of defects in materials or workmanship, then I can try to claim.

Read the meters immediately, then tell the gas/electric people what the number say. Record the values somewhere.

Get the property insured.

Meet and be friendly with the neighbours.

Find out what to do with the mail for the old tenants. Generally, if you don't know, mark them with ""NOT KNOWN AT THIS ADDRESS, RETURN TO SENDER"" and dump them back in a postbox.

Find the stopcock. Test it. Show everyone in the house where it is.

If there's an inventory of sale, make sure you got everything you paid for.

Check the heating's working, especially the boiler. Know who to call if the boiler goes on the fritz.

Personally, I would buy a complete set of matching (keyed-alike) locks for all the entrances and the garage with about 10 keys in total. Ensure you size appropriate locks - they're not all the same and it's quite likely that you'll need several different sizes. Replacing all the locks shouldn't be too hard - you'll only need a screwdriver and some common sense.

Check all the door seals before winter comes round, if they're leaky see if you can get some replacement tubing of the same size.

If you're doing some decorating, invest in a decent set of brushes.

Invest in a decent set of allen (sp?) keys, screwdrivers, some pliers, etc.

Check the inner door mechanisms - ours where cheap rubbish and the central sheath round the bar tended to crack rendering the door inoperable. This is not a problem you want to be fixing in week one, especially if someone gets trapped on the other side of the door.

Find the fuse box. Show everyone where it is and how to recover from a blowout.

EDIT: Freecycle and the like can be extremely useful during the first few weeks.

(1) that the UK would be able to get free trade and harmonisation of standards with a very large English-speaking market, which would allow our exporters to get much more sales abroad, and to more easily achieve scale on the world stage
(2) we would be able to reduce the cost of living on things like food and electronics goods, which are much cheaper in the US than the UK and could be cheaply imported.

Cons:
(1) The less efficient UK companies and sectors could be undercut by better performing American imports, which is good for consumers but could cause job losses in the short term as we adjust to the new landscape
(2) there's a danger that harmonisation of standards reduces some of the protections we currently require of businesses
(3) there's particular issue with an investment protection clause, that means US companies could sue the UK government if they feel they have not been treated fairly.

null,false,[deleted],null,null,null,"As for Lewis's argument, it's nonsense. Let's start with this:

&gt;It sounds bonkers, doesn’t it? But look at it like this: “political Twitter”, the small subset of the social network that isn’t tweeting about One Direction or surfers being ­attacked by sharks, is undeniably skewed to the left.

This is true to an extent but it's also true that the mainstream media, which the Oxbridge and private school educated Lewis is a leading part of, is much more of an insular echo-chamber than social media. This someone who makes a living running a low-circulation political magazine meant for a tiny number of professional insiders and their hobbyist fans! She used to host the ""[Booze and Schmooze](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/10/secret-of-networking-talking)"" networking event, not sure she still does, where the upper class twerps who make up the the media elite in Britain make their connections and build up their class consciousness in a way that would make any Marxist blush. Perhaps it's not so much that twitter is left-wing but that the British media is very right-wing? Twitter is quite lefty on the basis of the demographics that use it, but the media in Britain is incredibly right-wing, narrow, and drawn from an extremely privileged strata of Oxridge educated professionals, who think of themseles quite consciously as people who have a sacred paternalistic duty to control the public discourse, to navigate it away from terrain which is unfavourable to their class interests. We're seeing a masterclass of this kind of propaganda right now in relation to Jeremy Corbyn. And don't be embarassed to call it propaganda, it's an insult to real journalism to call this shit journalism.

&gt;Partly this is an advanced version of the “shy Tory” phenomenon that has long led pollsters to underestimate the Conservative vote.

The thing is it wasn't Shy Tories this election, it's Lazy Labour not turning out to vote + Scotland. You can see a lot of studies of this ([here](http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-resources/why-did-the-polls-go-wrong-by-jon-mellon-and-chris-prosser/#.VbF9ePkr7Bp) and [here](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=wide)) and you should assume that she knows this but is quite happy to leave that out to push the narrative she needs at this point in time. 

&gt;Instead, a large number of constituency parties are nominating Jeremy Corbyn, even though he doesn’t want to be leader, has never held a leadership position in the party and could never find two dozen fellow-travellers to form a shadow cabinet. Clearly, these CLPs don’t think that Corbyn is their best shot at beating Osborne, overturning his unjust policies and enacting Labour ones instead. They are doing it to signal that they are on the side of right and good

To try and dismiss the notion that Labour members are voting for Corbyn on the basis that they, shock horror, agree with his principled commitment to Labour values, she instead patronisingly suggests that the only reason anyone would possibly vote for this incompetent extremist is to show off to their friends on facebook how left-wing they are.

But let's look at the facts - Jeremy Corbyn is an incredibly committed and principled socialist who has dedicated his life to fighting for the working-class. He had the lowest expenses of any MP in the whole House of Commons, [claiming a mere £8.70](http://www.islingtongazette.co.uk/news/politics/islington_north_mp_jeremy_corbyn_is_the_country_s_lowest_expenses_claimer_1_748369) for a printer ink cartridge whilst the sensible, grown-up, leadership quality MP's were robbing people blind. He's been a sincere and popular MP for over 30 years and been involved in countless grassroots campaigns. Unlike every single other Labour leadership candidate he actually answers questions, and doesn't speak in cliche's and platitudes, he challenges people rather than panders, and he has earned the respect of the membership (and many in the country) for doing so, whereas the rest of the candidates treat their membership with open contempt. In the mind of a true propagandist being a careerist New Labour hack is ""principled"" whereas being a marginalised backbench socialist isn't, as we're about to see...

&gt;But I’ve had enough of people describing him as “principled” as if it were a synonym for “holds opinions I agree with”. Liz Kendall, who has been relentlessly called a Tory in disguise – a Facebook Q&amp;A she did was particularly testy on this front – is also principled. If you acknowledge that Corbyn is giving voice to marginalised opinions, you must also acknowledge it takes lady-balls to go to a meeting of Labour activists and say that you support the two-child benefit limit or the 2 per cent defence spending commitment. Kendall is booed at hustings while Corbyn is cheered. Her campaign is faltering precisely because she is saying what she believes.

&gt;As it happens, I disagree with her about the two-child limit – in the words of The West Wing’s Josh Lyman, Osborne apparently wants a government just small enough to fit into our bedrooms. But it is undeniably popular with exactly the people Labour was founded to represent.

This is the most disingenuous and appalling section in the article. For an expert spin-doctor and propagandist like Lewis lining up with the Tory party to attack children who have more than 2 younger siblings counts as a courageous choice, whereas Jeremy Corbyn publicly advocating talks with Sinn Fein in the 1980's makes him a performative ""ideological purist"" whose stance is purely for showing off to his friends on facebook how edgy and left-wing he is. Let's get it right - attacking the most vulnerable in society, cowardly rolling over to accept Tory party policy that contradicts the very heart of what Labour exists as a party to defend, is no kind of bravery. It doesn't take bravery for someone in a position of immense privilege to hit downwards and cosy up to those in power to do so. Oppose it takes courage. 

And Helen Lewis hasn't got the guts to defend the 2 child policy that the Tories have brought in, nor has she got the decency to take Liz Kendall apart for supporting such a vile policy, so she sticks up for her in the first paragraph then cowardly runs away from it in the second. She wants to be able to attack Labour members for not supporting this policy, but not have to take any of the flak for publicly endorsing it herself. Nice move. 

&gt;Ultimately, in the secrecy of the ballot, when there’s no more virtue signalling to be done, Corbyn will fade away.

And ultimately, in the secrecy of the ballot box, I have no doubt that Helen Lewis votes Tory. It might be her job to spout New Labour horseshit in the staggers but someone of her wealth and background knows which way to vote at a general election, I mean she's got house-prices to think about! 

&gt;But the country will have taken note of a Labour Party that seems to prefer the purity of opposition to the compromises of power.

It's very easy to talk about the compromises of power when you're Helen Lewis - it won't be her family that suffers. It's easy to talk about compromises when it's someone else that pays the price. These compromises are life and death to many people, especially the disabled and ill, which is why someone like Lewis can only approach them in eupehemism, but she knows deep down.

Great argument that. Just guessing. You've took the position that you don't like the monarchy and have childishly made up your own conclusions as to why, without doing any real research.

The Royal Family costs £40m to maintain. The Prince's Trust (charity made by Charles) made in 2008 £20m and employs nearly 700 people. And that's just one out of there many charities. 

This of course doesn't even take into account that while the Royal Family costs £40m we get £200m back from their lands. This also doesn't take into account the fact that Britain earns £7bn from tourists alone, hmmm I wonder what those profits would look like if you got rid of the first thing people think of when they hear ""Britain"": The Queen.

Tuition fees: expensive but you get a loan and you pay back after you make enough money so that's fine (I suppose).

Maintenance Loan: A loan to help you survive at university. This used to be a grant (so basically those from disadvantaged backgrounds were given pots of money to enable them to thrive at university), now it's become a loan and it's a small loan aswell (if your parents earn less than £25,000 then you're going to get roughly £3300) so poorer students are going to have to work alongside their studies in order to make rent and feed themselves. Students with rich parents aren't going to have to work because guess what? Mummy and Daddy can bank roll them so there's nothing to worry about.

Who's going to get better grades and come out with a better qualification? Student from poor background that has spent all his spare time trying to make rent or student from wealthy background that has spent his spare time studying/enjoying university life.

Then it comes to paying the loan back, the rich student probably didn't get the loan but if they did then they can pay it back whenever they fancy (because they finished uni with a good degree so whatever debt they built up is small change) but the poorer student (who perhaps didn't do as well for reasons explained earlier) is going to have to stretch out the repayments and thus incur interest and will end up paying back more.

Final point: The system is broken, if all these students from poor backgrounds don't earn a lot of money then they don't pay their loans back and then guess who has to foot the bill? (tax payer), this is an unsustainable system. I wouldn't be surprised at all if the government decides to increase the interest/remove the 30 year limitation on these loans (and this is a genuine fear) so that those on lower incomes are essentially handed a lot of debt that they didn't think they'd need to worry about.

**Veljkovic**: Was good at the U20 WC for Serbia. Could fit the CDM role we've been lacking.

**Carroll**: Not really youth at this point but if he isn't sold or we don't bring in a new CM I think he will see some significant time this year.

**Alli**: Lit League 1 on fire. Could be the partner for Nabil we need.

---

Players that *could* make some appearances depending on the situation:

**Winks**: Barring he doesn't go out on loan we may see him get more first team time.

**Onomah**: Probably needs some league football somewhere but could see some more time this year.

**Oduwa**: I wouldn't have listed him until I watched some of the pre-season footage and he looks damn good. He's also fairly large.


---

Long shots to appear:

**Kyle Walker-Peters**: Would need some injuries at RB to appear probably but he looks good.

**Cameron Carter-Vickers**: Is a monster but still quite young. Definitely in need of some league football somewhere to see how he stands up.

**Shaq Coulthirst**: He is #1 on our striker youth depth chart but I really don't rate him for us. With some injuries or striker sales we could see him but it would be desperate.

**McGee**: Our third GK going into the season so with some injuries we could see him. Hopefully we don't have to but I like him for the future. Great shot stopper.

---

Players I like but don't expect to see this season:

**Cy Goddard**: A veritable midget but so quick and good with his feet. I think he's still looking for a set role.

**Will Miller**: Super quick again and decent on the ball. Also very small.

**Ismail Azzaoui**: This kid seems to score in every youth game I watch. I expect him to be close to the first team next season.

**Luke Amos**: I haven't seen much of him but I liked what I did see. Seems to be well bellow Winks and Onomah in the pecking order though.

**Kenny McEvoy**: Follow him on Instagram for pictures of his bird. Don't actually expect to see him play for us.

I recall it flaring up badly when I was doing sit ups once, and then when I skipped afterwards, every time my feet met the floor, and gravity came down on my back, it felt like someone was jabbing a dagger into my back.

Eventually, I had a scan, and it turned out I had a bulge on one of my discs, which had been pressing against a nerve.

A bit of physiotherapy later, a correction in my posture, and laying off the weights for a while, and I was right as rain.

If it'd got worse I could've had a full blown herniated disc, and that's a terrible injury.

Don't just top up on pain killers mate. Your body is telling you something, don't ignore it.

null,false,Jotun90,null,null,null,"Ah, I see what you mean. No, I've never studied economics beyond Youtube lectures &amp; wikipedia articles as part of other conversations. When you skirt around the edge of Libertarianism you inevitably come across Friedman or Sowell links on Youtube. But I'd never claim to have any real understanding, I just take things that sound logical and present them as I did to try and invite criticism. I'd like to put my thoughts into a coherent order so I'm going to take the basis of each point:

a) trickle-down economics - the rhetoric of what I said was certainly in that vein, but not the context - the ""four pillars"" of Reaganomics were Austerity, cutting taxes (Income &amp; CG), lowering regulation &amp; 'tightening the money supply'. I'm talking about the immediate effect of a single one, the lowering of taxes, though it would take place within an austerity framework. (from basic Google searches I understand that tightening the money supply is effectively controlling the interest rate &amp; keeping it high). I don't see the lowering of tax across the board as an example though because we're talking about a relative increase in spare cash, 

b) the myth of the free market - absolutely, I'm with you 100%. I personally feel like I'm a social libertarian in the sense that I would like to see as much of the 'meat' privatised and generally deregulated (as the link suggests, I don't want to see 9 year olds in factories, but I do think regulations can be kept to a sensible minimum), to keep taxes lower and to preserve the amount of money we have to keep social programmes in place. Generally it seems to me that with excessive free marketeering you find huge inequality, and with excessive socialist principles you find a more content society but far more inefficiency in spending (I read in private eye recently how GPs, in order to pay rent on their surgeries, have to run it by something like 4 NHS agencies plus their landlord). On a philosophical level I would like to see people have the maximum possible avenues to succeed without losing the core social safety net. Thank you for the link by the way, don't have time to read it all now (I read enough to understand its relevance) but I'll certainly get back to it at a less unsociable hour.

c) free money / property / social mobility / landlording - We have a huge social welfare system so I'm not sure we can say that we only give money to the right people. I see rent-seeking as a tricky subject, because on the one hand rental property can be very beneficial - some people simply don't want to buy, some people can't afford to for various reasons, not just economic - you may be seriously considering moving abroad, you may be a student etc. It is a service that is beneficial to people in that sense, and so the wealth that is being created is effectively by proxy because you're enabling people to be more productive in a situation or environment that they otherwise would not be able to. What is not clear is whether the amount of potential renters is being inflated by private landlords holding housing and stopping them from buying, and whether the rental sector acts to inflate mortgages etc. My instinct is to say no, because my impression of the housing market is that it is tied down by planning regulation, lack of schemes to convert unused land, and the private hoarding of buildable land. 

On the distribution of property, I'll either edit something in later or I'll have to concede because it's 2am and I need to go to sleep. 

And on the social mobility point - absolutely, its a much more complicated issue. I did try to limit it to one example though, academia - and I do think we struck a serious blow to social mobility in that area when we gutted grammar schools in favour of a 'level playing field' comprehensive that gives no method of getting ahead due to merit unless your teacher really cares. And incidentally, I did notice in that Reaganomics report, the study the article cites mentioned the biggest benefactor for wealth equality in ""advanced economies"" are skills, which is why apprenticeships are so important. I actually think an unpopular part of the budget among the left (from what I've seen) will relaly help in this regard, the minimum wage hike, because it gives under 25's preferential treatment in the hiring process. But its a big issue, so you're 100% right to say that there are more points to consider.",null,0,null,1437700362,null,0,false,0,cte2aur,null,t3_3eax0i,null,t1_cte2aur,null,t1_cte06f8,null,null,null,1440049291,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

A 4231 has two central midfielders playing deep, with the 3 attacking midfielders and a front man up top. The two centre minds share defensive and attacking responsibilities relatively equally.

In a 433 there is usually one solely defensive midfielder acting as a pivot in front of the back four. He'll rarely get forward, and he'll do most of the covering at the back. In front of him will be two central midfielders who have much more licence to attack or defend, they operate under more freedom and less restriction than the pivot does.

Then you have three front men rotating as they see fit. Some systems have it more as two attacking wide players and a number 9, and some have it as 3 front men rotating all over the place.

Personally, I think we're more suited to playing 4231 at present.

&gt;-More deaths in police custody than at any time in the last five years.

I know correlation doesn't equal causation, but I think the case can be made that other agencies are unable to handle the extra workload/lack of resources and the police make a poor substitute for the medical care that the mentally ill need.

And yes, it is the tories that have made these cuts. I know it's been rattled around so much that it's almost become a meme, but Teresa May calling an independent review into the deaths is a token gesture from a woman who knows, more or less, that there is next to no provision for the mentally ill in this country and gives zero fucks. Maybe Labour would have made these cuts too, I don't know - but the current government is failing about a [quarter of the population of this country](http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/help-information/mental-health-statistics/) while it relies on the police as the primary agency to deal with mental health.

As for some idea being 'unthinkable', that's just the way things are.  Communist and Marxists viewpoints aren't banned.  I hear university lecturers and radical academics, not to mention people online, spout them all the time.  Paul Mason just wrote a piece praising Marx and heralding the end of capitalism that made it to the front of the Guardian's comment/opinion section- these ideas aren't unthinkable- they just aren't supported by most people.  

As for Snowden's leaks, nothing in them hadn't been widespread general knowledge since 9/11.   Everyone I spoke to knew security services monitored all phone calls and emails for references to terrorism, I remember joking about putting the word 'suicide' and 'bomb' in an email circa 2003.   That the man fled to the West's two greatest geopolitical rivals with a massive cache of stolen documents makes me far more inclined to believe he cut a rather dirty deal than that he is some kind of noble martyr anyway.  

It is unfortunate that Marx wrote about agitation the way he did, because it has led to generations of middle class socialists attempting to preach the word of the prophet to the working classes when really, they couldn't care less.

null,false,joethepro36,null,null,null,"I have to agree on his sentiment that Miliband's policies did not appeal to the traditional labour base. Such policies as the mansion tax seem more about punishing those successful in their lives or who happened to buy a house in London 50 years ago. The working class don't care too much if the rich are rich,, it's more about just eking out a damn living and providing for the future children. If you want to have the working class's votes you need to help them out directly or respond to concerns such as immigration instead of punishing others.

Still I think it a bit naive and of wishful thinking to claim that people turn from Labour to UKIP on the grounds of more power to the people. It's primarily about sovereignty and immigration and better put, needing sovereignty to tackle immigration. That UKIP wish to put more powers in the hands of constituents to recall MPs and apparently initiate laws is really a bonus.

I think the real issue about Labour's left wing ideology is an adherence to the old style of centralised government mandating a collectivist ideology on the people. A lot of economic control and central planning. That was all well and good back in the early 20th century when the horrors of Communist systems had yet to be seen, but people these days are generally fairly liberal and capitalist by default, even modern Conservatives are very liberal by the last century's standards. People these days tend to want more negative freedom and this is one of the more subtle reasons why UKIP has done better. People like myself have grown tired of the apparent hand up that society wishes to give in place of responsibility, hard work and choice. The patronising attitude that such things give aside, it's often the middle classes who are more predisposed and readily able to use such help anyway. 

The real issue with Labour's inability to organise these ""grand designs"" is just the track record still fresh in people's minds. The public debt is responsible for all of the cuts the Tories are making. Even being cynical and claiming its just Tory ideology taking advantage of the national debt situation still doesn't wash away the fact that the debt is hanging over our heads. Labour have given the Tories an excellent chance to enact whatever cuts and selloffs they want and the Tories can just claim ""oh but the debt"" *every single time*. To be fair to the Tories they seem to be doing okay with the economy so far and as much as people like to think cutting debt isn't an issue, many voters older and wiser than most here chose economic competence for certain from the Tories over a ""maybe it'll work out"" approach from Labour.",null,0,null,1437707999,null,0,false,0,cte6evz,null,t3_3edplg,null,t1_cte6evz,null,t3_3edplg,null,null,null,1440051228,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

null,false,AmerieHartree,,Democracy is the most revolutionary thing in the world,null,"Yes, very much - I feel like typing so I may as well expand upon my point, and the ones you have raised. On the point of Germany, many regard the response of the German administration to the spying scandals as a bit of a song and dance, whilst the administration continues to fully cooperate. However the German people are not having a song and dance, and there is no guarantee that the current administration, or an administration with the same policies as the current one, will continue in the future. Whilst Germany is certainly one of the most powerful members of the EU, it is worth remembering that it is one state out of 28, and it's population is 80.6 million out of 503 million - and without the agreement of other member states and the democratic support of a majority of the people, the USA will not find it easy to establish new trade deals (such as TTIP or TiSA). Since the 2000s international relations between the USA and France have been somewhat warmer, but there is no guarantee that this will continue*, and without the soft power exerted by Germany, France and the UK upon the rest of the EU the USA will not, in my opinion, find it easy to have a whole lot of influence in the EU at all. The UK seems to me to be the most consistently pro-USA country out of this western european bloc of three, and with our exit from the EU, I imagine the USA will find itself in a more precarious position concerning europe than is perhaps immediately apparent.

*To talk further on this, what really seems to matter in this regard is the French attitude towards the current regional conflict in the middle east and, more specifically, their attitude towards ISIS/Daesh. They are participating in air-strikes in Iraq against them, but the French government has already ruled out doing the same in Syria. As of now, the general strategy (if it can be called a strategy) of the forces involved in the war against ISIS/Daesh is to have western coalition forces and iranian forces cooperating with the Iraqi military inside Iraq, and for the US to lead a coalition of different countries from the region, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, etc to perform airstrikes in Syria ([this article](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/inherent-resolve.htm) is a helpful guide to the current operation), excepting things such as the recent disclosures about UK pilots embedded in US forces performing airstrikes in Syria. As I previously implied, I have rather serious doubts about whether the current state of operations there can be considered an actual strategy, and it is my opinion that the actual strategy for defeating ISIS/Daesh will be revealed sometime after the US presidential election - and indeed, it will probably include the goal of eliminating the Assad regime as well, if it does not deviate from the goal held several years ago by the US, the UK, and Saudi Arabia. It is at this point - and forgive me for the rather lengthy exposition - that France, along with other countries, will have to make a decision as to whether it favours a stronger pro-interventionist approach, or whether it favours the same as it did during the Iraq war. My immediate suspicion would be that they would take a similiar approach to the Iraq war, and this would again lead to a similiar souring of relations between the US and French administrations - however, this is not definite by any measure, and the terrorist attacks in France could certainly exacerbate any pro-interventionist feelings the current administration may have. The alternative to this scenario is that the next american administration does not favour a more pro-interventionist strategy in the middle east, which is certainly possible, but which I consider rather unlikely.

&amp;nbsp;




EDIT: several minor edits. Also, to lend some weight to my comments on the strategy against ISIS/Daesh, this is not just my view but also the view of various journalists from all sides of the political spectrum, Obama himself, and the view of the last government's own defence select committee, as shown in the seventh report on 'The situation in Iraq and Syria and the response to al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq al-Sham (DAESH)', delivered on 27 January 2015. To quote:

&gt; Although a UK intervention has been authorised by Parliament and, we were told, would be legal under international law, it is immensely difficult to define the nature of the UK strategy. Indeed, in evidence to the committee, the Service Chiefs implied that there was not an overall military strategy or campaign plan, at least as yet.

Yes it's busy and yes you might well have to wait but it does a good job of prioritising and treating despite ever growing demand.

Primary care however... too hit and miss.  My town only has one GP practice and a rapidly growing population which means it's very difficult to see a doctor.  Phone lines open at 8:30 but are normally so busy (""you're number 57 in the queue, please continue to hold"") that you become quite discouraged and despite niggling health issues I'm finding it very difficult to get treatment.

What contact I have had with various GPs, as a patient, has always been good though and I've never been left feeling that I'm not being listened to or treated appropriately.  They are trying to improve the appointment issues with introducing some bookable online appointments but now you're looking at 4+ week waits there too.  Professionally I find GPs to be very willing to take on work that may have ended up in our hands inappropriately, routinely making home visits and assisting me.  Doctors from all backgrounds have always turned up to help when I've asked for them too and always seem very willing to pass on their knowledge and experience when asked.  

Short answer is too many patients, too little staff and too many people living with chronic conditions.

The Ninth Doctor speaks in what I feel are pretty clear terms.

From The End of The World:

&gt; Doctor: You think it'll last forever, people and cars and concrete, but it won't. One day it's all gone. Even the sky. **My planet's gone. It's dead. It burned like the Earth.** It's just rocks and dust.

In this he is distinctly referring to the way he saw Gallifrey destroyed and compares it to how the Earth just got destroyed. It is burned, just rocks and dust. This is pretty specific.

And then later in Dalek:

&gt; Doctor: They're never going to come! Your race is dead! You all burnt, all of you. Ten million ships on fire. The entire Dalek race wiped out in one second. 

&gt; Dalek: You lie! 

&gt; Doctor: **I watched it happen. I made it happen.** 

&gt; Dalek: You destroyed us? 

&gt; Doctor: I had no choice. 

&gt; Dalek: And what of the Time Lords? 

&gt; Doctor: Dead. **They burnt with you.** The end of the last great Time War. Everyone lost. 

He specifically refers to watching it happen. Not being there one minute and then everything was gone the next (which he likely would if he had memory issues). Not everything being gone in the blink of an eye.

Even in the 50th Ten and Eleven show it is pretty clear that they know they are changing events:

&gt; Tenth Doctor: You're not actually suggesting that **we change our own personal history?** 

&gt; Eleventh Doctor: We change history all the time. I'm suggesting far worse. 

&gt; War Doctor: What, exactly? 

&gt; Eleventh Doctor: Gentlemen, I have had four hundred years to think about this. **I've changed my mind.**

He doesn't think at this Moment oh maybe I never destroyed Gallifrey because we saved it, he thinks I am going to change my mind. I am going to change the decision I made.

&gt; General: Which it isn't, why would you do such a thing? 

&gt; Eleventh Doctor: **Because the alternative is burning.**

&gt; Tenth Doctor: **And I've seen that.**

&gt; Eleventh Doctor: **And I never want to see it again.**

And as with Nine both Ten and Eleven refer to ""seeing"" Gallifrey burn and don't want to ""see"" it again so obviously what they are about to do will look nothing like what happened then. They obviously have a memory to compare it too and it was not an explosion. It was burnt.",null,0,null,1437711390,null,0,false,0,cte843a,null,t3_3eea16,null,t1_cte843a,null,t1_cte4bbe,null,null,null,1440052030,null,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5,null

What I would argue is that the ethos of the entire episode was based on the idea that treating the Flesh as disposable, non-living technology was flawed and irresponsible.  The ethical concerns raised did not extend only to the seemingly very rare circumstance where a ganger or group of gangers become autonomous, but to the idea that they were constantly imbuing the *living* substance of the Flesh with human memories and feelings, only to strip this away.  

I'm not trying to be nitpicky, nor do I believe that I am just reading too much into it. These concerns arise pretty explicitly within the text of the episode itself--through discussion of the damage done by the constant rewriting of the Flesh's memory, through the discovery of discarded raw Flesh material clinging to life, and through the survivors' insistence on speaking out against the entire practice of using Flesh to create gangers.

2) I will work in C London as a consultant on long hours.  Living in Stevenage, Northampton or Coventry would a cheaper way to enter the housing market, but fuck that commute if you don't leave the office until 8pm most nights.

3) I don't have a bare minimum of £40k spare as a housing deposit.  If I did, I'd have bought a fucking flat already, wouldn't I...

So many people already on the housing ladder have no idea what level of housing deposit is required and how tough it is to build one (when you ain't getting payrises above inflation and don't have a bank of Mum and Dad to tap).

---------------------------

(Rant over, seriously, congratulations OP, that's awesome.)

My suggestions

1) Look for any kind of mould/damp and get rid of it first

2) Over time you will want to do stuff up.  Before you do, build up a slush fund of £2-3k for when shit breaks.  Especially the boiler.  They can cost horrendous amounts of money to fix.

3) Once the slush fund is sorted out, start saving.

4) If there's a garden, consider converting it into your own allotment.  Gives you something to do, you can see verifiable results and you save £ on the food (plus it tastes a lot nicer than supermarket food).

5) Start tarting up the lounge/dining room/bedrooms for quick results.  Tiling is one thing, but anything more serious in the kitchen/bathroom maybe you wanna leave to a pro.  As someone else said, get local recommendations for a good one.

Here's our transfers of the 14/15 season with transfer fees listed if you'd like to see for yourself: http://www.transfermarkt.com/manchester-city/transfers/verein/281/saison_id/2014

&gt; Even his apology was a cop-out. 

&gt; ""After making that long solo run [against Germany] I was so tired when I got to the goal area,"" Ayew said, per Samuel Ebo Kwaitoo at Graphic Online. ""I didn't make any mistake, but when they told me I made a mistake, I accepted it and apologised to the team.""

&gt; Ayew's flagrantly selfish attitude was just one example of the disharmony in the Ghanaian squad.


&gt; The cynical way Ayew conducts himself on the field is a red flag.

&gt; * World Cup performances showed Ayew's blatant disregard for his teammates.
&gt; * Two minutes after then-Sochaux teammate Edouard Butin scored, Ayew relinquished his team's momentum by lashing out at Monaco substitute Andrea Raggi.
&gt; * Ayew took one minute and 51 seconds to receive two yellow cards against Evian Thonon Gaillard.

This is because when the state is the only player it has to be seen to be fair, since there is no chance of competition. 

Also, when the state controls a company many positions are politicized which is not a good thing. Imho the state should focus on removing externalities and being there as the actor of last resort and controlling one of two public goods (army, police etc).

It is well known and documented that having protected industries (e.g. black cab drivers) pushes up costs as the higher barriers to entry reduce competition. How can you argue for such a highly regulated industry when there are better and cheaper ways for these services to be provided to consumers? 

The recession of 2008 was nothing compared to the aftermath of a war which saw cities flattened and millions displaced. To compare the two is frankly astounding. The list of casualties from 2008 aren't even a rounding error to the atrocities that were seen between 1939-45.

The issue of 2008 was not growth but debt shocks, yes ok the government could have printed money and continued spending but at some point there will be a default - or rather serious devaluation which is a default in all but name. Could it have worked? Yes, most likely. Would it solved all the problems that we see now? No, not at all. Wages would still have fallen, the cost of living would still go up.

Even countries like Japan and Italy which have high internal savings which allow them to maintain high debt to gdp ratios will come unstuck unless they reform which Abe in Japan is trying to do. Italy well, they'll be Greece 2.0 and then we will truly see disintegration of the Eurozone unless things change (including fiscal transfers from the North).

Also, compare the social welfare that exists now to that of 1949 the two are quite literally worlds apart. We have benefits and services now that were unheard of in 1949. The left has been incredibly successful and this is conveniently forgotten. Even the most market minded Tory would acknowledge that there's been great strides in the social sphere. 

While collective ownership/communism may have lost the cold war social democracy won the peace; at least in Europe. In order to sustain this quality of life we need to work hard and advance our economies  and realise we can't have everything.

Education in University when it was ""free"" was for the absolute elites, so few people went to university from working class or even middle class families. Now the opportunity is open to pretty much everyone. Is this a good thing? Yes, probably. We need an educated workforce. But that comes at the cost of the individual bearing more of the overall cost in the form of an incredibly generous student loan (graduate tax).

I mean, for example, you could say that the tenant has to pay for window cleaning, in their block of flats, in addition to the rent. That's £100 a month per tenant. The landlord gets £80 of it as a finders fee, the window cleaner gets £20 for £5 worth of work. 

You can try to get rid of loopholes, but as has been found with tax, it's not all that easy to do, and the final response, if you ever did, would be for landlords to simply stop maintaining the properties entirely.

I can get to most of the components easily and it's a relatively simple machine. If you can identify the issue you can go around asking for quotes to fix the issue and you can try to gauge how much people are messing you around. Even if you don't know what's up it's good to get quotes, as people will see a Duc coming (or maybe it's because I look more like a blonde bimbo than somebody who has a basic knowledge of mechanics) and try to rip you off. For example, a simple valve adjustment at one company was quoted at around £1,000 and the guys I went with did it for £240. So far I've done 1,200 miles (of 8,700) and it's only needed it's valves done and a carb clean. I need to replace the back brake pad, too. Bear in mind, it's an old girl so this isn't really bad going.

The newer ones? I honestly have no idea. If you can't get to the components, parts are expensive or they require special tools or they are particularly weird, it's going to be harder to maintain and you're more likely to need the shop.

null,false,ADozenNeverNudes,null,null,null,"Just to check your boyfriend is a tenant not a lodger right (the landlady lives at a different address?). If so there are two situations here - either your boyfriend is on a fixed term tenancy, or he is on a rolling tenancy, and which it is makes a big difference. 

If he is fixed term the landlord cannot serve notice during the fixed term without cause. They need a reason (eg not having paid rent) and to apply to court for an eviction order. Until this happens your boyfriend need not do anything. Subletting/allowing someone to live at the property unauthorised is grounds for eviction, and you should have got the landlady's consent first - you were probably in breach of the tenancy if you were there for more than a week or two. However, you did move out when asked and the lack of an HMO works in favour. A court would make their own decision, and you boyfriend could argue his case, but in any event proper notice needs to be given and then the court process would take some time.

If the tenancy is rolling the landlord can give notice for any reason. They must give two months notice ending in a rental date (that is key - tell me if you want that explained). The notice is called a ""section 21"" notice, in the case of a rolling contract it must be in writing and state it is a s.21 notice. A s.21 notice is not valid if served whilst a house that should have an HMO licence does not. 

The key thing to remember is **a landord cannot end a tenancy**. Only the tenant or a court can end a tenancy. A landlord gives notice of their *intention to seek posession* not to terminate the tenancy. If you do not leave after the notice expires (which you are not required to do) then the landord can go to court for an order. The landlady saying she is going to evict at the end of the month is meaningless - she cannot. Either of the methods will take time and effort in her part, you are not required to leave a property until ordered to by a court. Maybe the best approach is to let this rest for a time and hope she calms down, or until you got some more official paperwork. In the meantime discretely talk to your local council and call Shelter.

This is interesting. The voter turn out drop off started in Blair's first term and has continued since then.

So since 92 we've not had a real 'left' candidate and the debate has been centre or centre-right. This coincides with a drop off in the vote particularly from the youth, who traditionally are normally left leaning and are constantly complaining about being unrepresented in the debate. No one under 40 years old has had a chance to vote for anyone with a sniff of power more left than Ed and then we wonder why they don't vote? We tell them if you get out and vote then politics will swing towards you, but if they get out and vote they either get ignored at the fringes or further prop up the centre that they want to see a swing away from. You can see this in Scotland, obviously the results are confounded by info issues but a real left alternative pulled out more voters and stormed the place.

Tl;dr in contesting the centre with the Tories labour have left behind a huge traditionally left demographic, who are currently sat around not voting because they feel unrepresented by anyone that matters. Whether that's enough to counter the votes lost by ceding some of the centre to the Tories I don't know.

There is a distinctly London-centric and pro-UK Gov stance in their reporting and the way they handle Scottish news and issues is a total embarrassment, acting like a state broadcaster rather than a public one.

When [less than half of Scotland](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/14/bbc-scottish-coverage-independence-row-referendum) thinks the BBC does well in representing Scotland in news content then there is quite a clear issue.

I hope the BBC becomes a devolved institution like it should be and moves away from being fully centred around London.

For the amount of money that goes towards the BBC from Scotland (~£300m) an £86m annual budget is pitiful and leaves little room for local content and is ridiculously more expensive when you compared it to programming in Ireland ([RTE for example pays 21m for BBC channels each year](http://static.rasset.ie/documents/about/2012-english-annual-report-for-the-web.pdf)).

I'm hoping to sell all this stuff in one go. I'm guessing it'd come up to about £1,000 (around 63% original sale value).
All this stuff was bought and assembled in February (aside from the Asus wifi card, which I got because the mobo's onboard wifi wasn't up to the job).
The CPU has been moderately overclocked but not used for anything very intense - same deal with the graphics card.

Arctic silver 5 thermal paste
Stock i5 cooler, replaced by the Noctua one
A mostly full can of air
Antistatic band
A tin of  alcohol for thermal paste replacement (not to drink!)

I would prefer the buyer to collect from near me (Maidenhead, Berkshire) but I can drive out a short distance if this would be helpful. However, I would remove the CPU cooler, as Noctua recommend against having it on during transportation owing to the weight.

All packaging and warranty info for the parts included. None of the warranty schemes have been registered.

It seems to me that a lot of those are government policies already (Free Schools, defence spending, staying in the EU, increasing ""efficiency"").

I've just remembered one thing I read before the leadership contest that I think would be interesting for her to expand on.

She talked about the future of health care being big data and personalisation. I completely agree with her here and would like to see her expand on this with actual policies. For example: video chat GP appointments, linking data from FitBits and the like to the NHS, giving people more control over their health records.

I think it's a nice, positive message that excites people about the future and can be at worst cost neutral with efficiency savings.

I'd be interested to hear about small business help as well. I wonder if we could get a slate of policies around supporting small business, especially with wages and regulation, allowing us to toughen up on big business and low pay. 

Some ideas I had: either reduced regulations for businesses of a certain size, or a government support service for things like compliance or payroll to help small businesses access the economies of scale large businesses enjoy. Along with a move to a real Living Wage, offer support for key small businesses with wages. Obviously not hand car washes and the like, but maybe in key industries or for key workers.",null,0,null,1437729671,null,0,false,0,cteeagl,null,t3_3echjk,null,t1_cteeagl,null,t1_ctduan4,null,null,null,1440055007,null,1,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

They're around £15 - £40.

Now you've got your TV plugged in, what do you want to do with it?  If you want to watch cable or satellite TV, play video games, etc you'll be fine.  The HDMI standard is worldwide.

In practice of course they don't save, something always comes up - but we could mandatorily divert a part of National Insurance into the pots (forced savings in other words) and strictly control how people draw it out (when unemployed or sick) so they don't blow it all on a flash car and then have to go to their council for help.",null,0,null,1437729988,null,0,1437730425,0,cteedbd,null,t3_3efc38,null,t1_cteedbd,null,t3_3efc38,null,null,null,1440055044,null,3,false,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

The stores were locked into expensive high street rental agreements, most of which had 2.5% annual rent increases, making their overheads jump and jump. At the same time, the company was being squeezed by the supermarkets' growth into non-retail goods (this was before the move away from giant supermarkets) and the first wave of discounters like Wilkinsons. The decline in CD sales had a massive impact too, as this was one of their most profitable items.

In the aftermath of the de-merger, the management of Woolworths did too little to re-imagine and renovate the brand, leaving stores and sales stagnant.

Woolworths' share price was on the slide as early as 2006 and generally, if you can't make money in a booming economy you are going to the wall when a recession comes around.

That happened in 2008. Consumer spending took a hit and retail became more competitive than before. Woolworths was still locked into those rising rents, and had to deal with a different landlord for pretty much every store, meaning they were unlikely to be able to negotiate much. Because of the crunch on credit, banks and creditors were very unlikely to offer them any grace periods and so they were unable to build the capital to keep going through the lean times.   

The result was that they had overheads they couldn't keep up with, and administration was the only answer.",null,0,null,1437730339,null,0,false,0,cteegg1,null,t3_3ef5ov,null,t1_cteegg1,null,t1_ctee2j2,null,null,null,1440055085,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

* you're [on a low income](https://www.gov.uk/apply-tax-free-interest-on-savings/tax-free-savings) - if you have a taxable income excluding interest of less than £15,600 then you can get some or all of your non-ISA savings interest tax free

I don't personally believe that welfare spending is as high as public perception makes it out to be. Especially not when compared to lost tax revenues from high tax avoidance.
Our benefit system is harsh and more driven towards internal targets (such as getting people off benefits, but not into paid work) than towards helping people develop themselves. 

My personal view is that we should plug the bigger hole in the economy before worrying about the small amount lost through benefits such as JSA.

Moreover, it is better for everyone if the system is implemented, and we need people to discover that for themselves. 

As for referendums, I think that people would love to have a more direct say. If I were elected today, I would announce a huge referendum day for a year from now and put lots on it. I'd ask them if they want in the EU, if we should legalise marijuana, if we should ban the burqa, if we should close faith schools, if we should get rid of trident and if we should elect by PR. A huge amount of Farage's support came from painting politicians as a Westminster elite who thought they knew better than the ordinary people. What more could disprove that and win them back by promising direct democracy on issues they know politicians are too scared to touch? Moreover, all of those are opinion issues, not science ones, so it's entirely right that the country gets to decide on them. Also, it's a great stick with which to beat the Tories - ""we aren't advocating either side, we just want the people to have their say; do the Tories not trust the people to know what's best for them?""

Downvotes are to be used on comments that do not contribute to the discussion or are off-topic. [That is the purpose of them according to Reddit.You should not download just because you don't agree with what the poster is saying.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

So far as I can see /u/backtowriting always contributes to the discussion. However his posts are frequently downvoted by some people. I haven't downvoted any comments on Reddit for months, but if I did I would explain why I think the comment deserved a downvote. I think that this reasonable and only courteous.

However I understand that many people on /r/UK just downvote when they don't like the content of the post and do it without explaining why. To explain why they downvote a particular comment would take effort and thought so some people may not be up to the task. I understand why someone who takes the time to contribute thoughtful comments to a discussion would get frustrated at people who just downvote without contributing a counter-argument.

The action of downvoting because you don't like what the other person is saying truly is childish. It's what children do when they aren't articulate enough to form an opinion. It's like stamping your feet and shouting. It's not the action of an adult.

I guess it's a matter of standards, some have them, others don't.

Inter connector to the nordic countires are all ready being built which also us acess to both there excess green, there energy markets and storage in there hydro system. We have our own hydro energy storage systems but there is not enought capacity for the entire nation. The next step is end user storage such as tesla which help end users store the own energy and let them store energy  from the grid when its cheap effectivilty inverting there energy usage, no more kettle rush, there are other energy storage solution such as sub station batteries which do the same at a grid level.

Then in development the is vacuum flywheel technology, capacitors and most importantly e-diesel which allows us to long term storage of electricity as liquid fuel.

Then there energy reduction like that insulation building standard which only requires heating for the towel rail, its used in Sweden and Germany to great effect and would drastically reduce our energy needs both on gas and electricity and if goverment funded would end fuel poverty in this country.

This is the danger with all policy - if you are not in office, your opponents can change things at will. If we had Hartz IV here, I've *no doubt* that IDS would be using it as workfare for private companies.

I've come to teh conclusion that we should try to design policy that's tamper proof by future govts if we can.

Which brings me to the idea of the private accounts thing. One of the issues of doing things via tax is that the next govt can just change the law and cut what you get, just like that. I mean, that's what the benefit cuts are really about, arn't they? People paying in and the rules then changing on them. But we have a 1000 year old common law system protecting private property (the words ""an Englishman's home is his castle"" were actually said by a judge in a case back in the 1300's when some local baron was trying to force his way into someone's house). So doing it via a pot owned by the individual would protect it from some future govt thinking this is easy money to be snatched, because British govts are scared to breach the ""private property is sacred"" part of English common law, because it's so embedded in our national psyche.

The downside is that the insurance industry is *notorious* for scams - pension mis-seling, PPI mis-selling, endowment misselling, they mis-sell everything - so we'd have to insist the money was in gilts (which are super safe, because the individual is effectively lending to the govt).

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"I'm trying my best not to be fixated on the number of goals that Benteke will score. Instead, I'd rather hope that Benteke is enough of a threat to open up the space others (like Sturridge) will need to score goals.

Is Benteke that player? I think so. I hope so. I don't see why not.

* 2012-13: Benteke scored the 4th most goals (19) in the League.
* 2013-14: He scored 10 goals in a season marred by injury (hip flexor early in the season; ruptured achilles in April '14)
* 2014-15: He scored the 9th most goals (13) in the League in what seemed to be an up-and-down season. But he ended ""up"" with Player Of the Month honours in in April. And he was easily the primary attacking threat for an almost-relegated Villa squad.

So, where does the 24-year-old Benteke go from here with Liverpool?

Well, first off, it's easy to argue that Benteke is on a better squad and while he has the pressure of making a good impression at Liverpool, he has also does not shoulder the burden of being the primary goal-scorer.

I have a loose theory that gives me a lot of optimism for this upcoming season and I think we'll surprise a lot of people...

In a broad sense, I believe that a player has to reach a certain age (25 to 28) to reach their so-called ""peak"" in their evolution as a player. And if you're an international player, I also think that the player needs three or so full seasons to really adjust to the rigors of the league.

Obviously there are exceptions to this idea but, like I said, it's a very broad, general theory.

But going forward with this idea, I think there are some very encouraging signs for not only Benteke but others in our squad...

* Benteke: Currently 24-years-old; About to start his 4th season in the Premier League.
* Coutinho: 23-years-old and a bit on the young side but he's entering his 3rd full season in the League.
* Henderson: 25-years-old. He has been in the League much longer but he has continued to grow in the last couple seasons and he is entering that ""peak"" age. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the season where he puts it all together and scores 10+ goals with 10-15 assists.
* Lovren: 26-years-old, entering his 3rd season in the League. And he should be helped immensely by his old Southampton teammate Nathaniel Clyne who is 24-years-old and entering his 4th season in the League.
* Sturridge: 25-years-old and seemed prepared to be a dominant goal-scorer alongside Suarez until his 2014-15 campaigned was ruined with injury.
* Lallana: A bit of a late-bloomer at 27 but he is entering his 4th full season in the Premier League.
* Mignolet: I suppose you'd give a bit of a longer leash to keepers so at 27 and entering his 6th season in the league and with a strong end to last season... you can even see Mignolet making another strong step forward in his development.

Now throw in old veterans like Milner, Skrtel, Kolo, etc. and hungry youngsters like Can, Ibe, Origi, etc. And then you start to see a promising season and future ahead.

I know, I know, we've heard this story before, ""You just wait, our young players are going to come good. We're building a core, a new foundation,"" blah blah blah. But the results have been poor, the progress, frustrating.

But with the aforementioned age and experience, I think the next two seasons are going to represent a remarkable leap forward in our progress and, ultimately, that will help us be able to focus on that *one* or *two* so-called ""marquee"" players who can bring everything together and help us start to challenge for a League title and Champions League much more frequently and much more seriously.

Summertime optimism? Possibly. But I have to say that I have generally been pretty cautious about our squad over the last two or three seasons but this season is where I am throwing caution to the wind.

I'm not suggesting that we'll win the League or anything like that. But I think a 4th place finish should be reasonable and, more importantly, I think we'll see a more cohesive and consistent squad week-in and week-out, and the development of an identity for our squad.

Caution is fully in the wind.",null,0,null,1437733290,null,0,false,0,ctef6wq,null,t3_3ef4tn,null,t1_ctef6wq,null,t3_3ef4tn,null,null,null,1440055431,null,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11,null

*Labour’s performance*

* Labour’s vote has been in decline since 1997. The 2015 
election reversed this trend with Labour gaining 741,000 
votes and increasing its vote share slightly. 
* However, these additional votes were concentrated in 
Labour seats, whilst there was a swing to the Tories in 
Conservative-held marginals.  
* Around one in five of the electorate considered voting 
Labour but didn’t. In the end, Labour won more seats from 
the Tories than they lost. But, continued its 14 year decline 
in seats won.
* The two party vote share remained the same in 2015 as 
2010, but now Labour competes with four rather than two 
smaller parties.

*Big holes*

* With the exception of London, Labour made few gains in 
any part of the country. It lost seats in the East Midlands 
and Wales and of course Scotland, which is now the place 
in Britain where Labour holds fewest seats. 

* Labour’s poor performance in the South was not 
particularly out of trend with other parts of the country 
when compared to 2005 or 2010.  The biggest failings were 
in suburbia, small towns and new towns. Labour also did 
poorly in seaside towns. 

* Labour’s vote by class remained similar to 2010 (the middle 
class vote held firm). However, Labour did poorly amongst 
blue collar voters - many of whom voted for the Tories and 
UKIP.

* Whilst Labour’s vote amongst working age people bounced 
back in 2015, those aged 65 and over continued to drift 
off. The Conservatives gained twice as many votes from 
over 55s as Labour.  Labour won just one in five of the ‘grey 
vote’. 

* Labour won around 450,000 more votes from women than 
men (mainly among women below retirement age).

* Labour did poorly amongst homeowners. But, it had the 
support of half of those in social housing and made gains 
with voters in the private rented sector. 

* Labour secured the vote of two thirds of non-white voters. 
However, it gained the vote of just 28% of white voters – 
11 percentage points behind the Conservatives. 

*Winning again*


* Labour faces an even bigger challenge in 2020, and (with 
boundary changes) will have to win over 100 seats to 
command a majority, compared with 68 seats in 2015.

* For Labour to win a majority at the next election it would 
need a swing similar to that of 1997 (although a 5% swing 
could be enough for a minority/coalition). 

* Most of these 100 seats need to be taken from the Tories 
(around 92 seats). They are spread across the country. The 
Conservative-Labour marginals will be in: middle Britain 
– major towns and outer urban areas; wealthier Britain in 
rural and suburban parts of the midlands and north; new 
towns, largely located in the south, and struggling seaside 
towns. 

* In the 92 seats only 10 had a combined Lib Dem and Green 
vote that was bigger than UKIP’s. 

*Policy implications*

* The most important issues at the election were the NHS, 
economy and immigration, with the latter two seen as the 
top priority. 

* Labour performed poorly on the economy.  For every 
person that saw Labour best on the economy there were 
two who thought the Conservatives were.

* For those who considered Labour but voted Conservative, 
the biggest worry was that Labour could not be trusted on 
the economy; that they would make it too easy for people 
to live on benefits and may raise taxes. Large numbers also 
wanted Labour to be tougher on immigration.

* To win again Labour will need policies which are attractive 
to winning the support of older people. 

* Labour needs to consider how it can reconnect with large 
numbers of blue collar voters. 

* Labour must do better in the South, but outside of London 
makings gains will be limited. To win again Labour must 
have an offer for places such as Scotland, seaside towns, 
suburbs and small towns. 

* Retail policy offers to one group or another will not be 
enough to win again. Labour needs to be trusted on the 
economy, on immigration and welfare. It must start by 
being a credible and competent opposition.


___

This is probably the most comprehensive look at our performance in 2015 so far published. It confirms the TUC findings that we failed on the economy, immigration and welfare. It also confirms the Fabians' point that we need to win more votes from those who voted Conservative than from any other group in order to win.

Those of the left of the party will be pleased to note that we need to win back working-class voters, as it forms a fairly key part of their platform, but less pleased to note that the way to do that, it seems, is to cut back on immigration and welfare, and be stronger on defence.

Blairites, on the other hand, will probably applaud the conclusions' call for 'reimagining the state' (i.e., public sector reform).

The conclusions seem pretty sensible, to me: Labour needs to move on from the spending debate and construct a new narrative about the kind of country we want to live in.
