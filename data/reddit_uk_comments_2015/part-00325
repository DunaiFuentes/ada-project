So they must be sectarian too.

&gt;I've never even heard of the Jesuits, but I bet they don't march through Catholic neighbourhoods in celebration of winning victories over Catholic armies hundreds of years ago. 

Let me get this straight. It's only sectarian when Catholics aren't the people celebrating?

Either way you've just deviated from your flat 'protestants only = sectarian' line you've been using to criticise the loyal orders probably because it's just been easily debunked.

&gt;An example of my ""nationalist bias"" is saying the Orange Order is a sectarian organisation. You don't have to be a fucking nationalist to think that, 

But you do have to be a bigot that uses a negative stereotype to generalise an entire community. Again, this is all one way criticism from a guy who initially got annoyed at nats getting generalised...

Cleansing your skin with a product is an important part of skin care. To help clear acne up you need to remove the day/nights sweat, dirt and all the bacteria that it creates. Sadly we sold aweful advice my big box companies like neutrogena who put terrible reactive chemicals in their products, that mostly lead to 15 years of me wasting money and ruining my skin :( 

I've learned that products without the drying alcohol and other unnecessary chemicals really help remove bad stuff, whilst not breaking down the acid mantle. (That's the good bit of your skin) 

I'd really suggest looking into buying a good quality, low chemical cleansing wash. There are many good products at acceptable price ranges. I'm now using eucerin purifying face wash. It's very gentle. Also no 'exfoliating' beads which we all know are aweful. Your chemical exfoliation is the best option. For more cleansing options check out the side bar. The same with moisturisers. Very important part of skin peeling. I'm currently using super drugs gentle range light moisturiser and skin serum with great results. 2 for £3.50 at the moment. 

My last photos update my skin exploded as I was oil cleansing, but I've dropped that from my everyday regime, I'm taking antibiotics and I've started chemical peel - my skin is really happy. 

I hope this info isn't to much blah. Xx love to hear and see the results in a few weeks. Xx

And then when/if he completed the diploma which takes an additional year to do, he got another certificate as this is probably equivilent to a full A2. 

So the SD is a prerequisite to the diploma like in the same way you have to pass an AS to do A2. The diploma supersedes the other one, so he would just say that he has a diploma, not that he has both as they're both level 3. In the same way that I have A2 biology, chemistry, geography and psychology and AS maths. I don't also say that I have AS chemistry, geography, biology and psychology. But I would say that I have gcse chemistry, biology and geography as they're completely different qualifications.

&gt;The Regulatory Policy Committee – an independent body appointed by the government which verifies the costs and savings of proposed changes to businesses and civil society – has today (Friday) slammed the government’s trade union proposals impact assessments as “red – not fit for purpose”.

&gt;The RPC found that the government had not made the case for any changes in the law on trade union picketing and protest – including proposals to make unions give 14 days’ advance notice of whether their members will use Twitter or Facebook during protests. They said that ‘there is little evidence presented that there will be any significant benefits arising from this proposal’ and 'the definition of the problem currently appears weak and must be substantiated'.

&gt;On agency workers being allowed to replace striking workers, the RPC found that the government's impact assessment undermines its own central assumption, as 'it provides reasons why it might be more beneficial to the employer to take the short-term costs associated with a strike instead of seeking temporary workers'.

&gt;And the RPC suggested that the government had been too hasty in pushing through their proposals, and called on the government to consult further – including specifically with those unions and employers affected by the additional 40 per cent threshold requirement for industrial action.

&gt;TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said “The government’s trade union bill threatens the basic right to strike – and it’s being rammed through with unseemly haste, without a proper case being made.

&gt;“We’re pleased that the Regulatory Policy Committee has exposed the lack of consultation and the unfair imposition of excessive red tape on unions and employers. This is an opportunity for the government to take a step back, recognise that they were wrong, and drop these proposals which threaten the democratic right to strike.” 

&gt;NOTES TO EDITORS:

&gt;- The RPC’s full judgements are available here

&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/red-rated-impact-assessment-opinions-since-may-2015

&gt;- The RPC is chaired by a business representative who used to work in the energy sector, and it includes members who work for PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Tata, as well as two economists and a City lawyer. In addition, two members of the RPC are members of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties respectively. There is one trade union representative who was not included in discussions around these assessments so as to avoid a conflict of interest. The membership and register of interest for the RPC is available here:

&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-policy-committee-members-register-of-interests-2014/members-register-of-interests-2015

&gt;- The RPC enjoys support from government and business. The Small Business, Industry and Enterprise Minister Anna Soubry recently said of the RPC:“...[the] Regulatory Policy Committee has an important part to play. They are a strong independent body and their scrutiny of our work should give businesses confidence.”

&gt;- Sajid Javid has also endorsed its work. Many employers’ organisations have also endorsed the important role of the RPC – see for examplehttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/regulatory-policy-committee-appointed-as-the-independent-body-verifying-the-costs-and-savings-of-changes-in-law

&gt;- The government’s trade union proposals threaten the right to strike.

&gt;Employers will be able to break strikes by bringing in agency workers to replace strikers. This could risk public safety and impact on the quality of services. Major new restrictions on pickets and protests will mean that striking workers will have to tell their employer all their plans – including what they will post on Facebook or Twitter or whether they will use a loudspeaker - two weeks before the strike.In ‘important public services’ (fire, health, education, transport, border security and nuclear decommissioning), 50% of members must turn out to vote and 40% of the entire membership must vote in favour (that amounts to 80% of those voting, on a 50% turnout).",null,0,null,1440232125,null,null,false,0,cubmud1,null,t3_3hvb4s,null,null,null,t1_cub59k4,null,null,null,1441401182,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

Million Poker for Kevin De Bruyne. Yesterday Bayern Munich also jumped suddenly back in the dance. Earlier in the morning Wolfsburg managed to agree with Man City with the last bid of 72 million euros. On one condition: that they got two days to think. The ultimate step to keep De Bruyne (24) in Germany. Reported Het Laatste Nieuws.

Bayern defender Dante would be potentially involved in the deal.

Manchester City and Wolfsburg had firmly negotiated in recent days. That led to an encouraging phone call from Germany with the message that Wölfe could find themselves in the transfer amount, including bonuses, of 72 million euros. An informal commitment to City, where there were conditions attached. Wolfsburg asked to postpone the completion of the deal until after the weekend. De Bruyne still be able to play against Cologne today, but mainly to give Bayern Munich a chance to put a similar proposal on the table. The bottom can be had from the. 

50 million + Dante? 

Bayern had already reported in May, but had then been no lay there and just resign as rejection applied to everyone. From then stood aside, no formal proposals. So offered a middleman De Bruyne again yesterday with the German record champion. It went on in there. According to sources close to the Bavarian club was among others the following scenario in the sleeve: Bayern would now be willing to pay 50 million euros, a player (Dante Sébastien Red?), Offer in return and also consider Kevin De Bruyne another year on loan in the Volkswagen Arena to leave. A proposal that Wolfsburg have looked bleak. Or Bayern succeeded in his coup, will become clear in the coming hours. 
 
Decision in this weekend

In Manchester, where they also have their spies, they smelled a rat last night already, but they worried little. They have a personal chord with our compatriot and make themselves strong that Bayern financially race can not cope with them. But still ... If Bayern and Wolfsburg are yet to recover from the next few days, De Bruyne can unexpectedly choose between two options. This weekend is the decision: Bayern or City.",null,0,null,1440232141,null,null,1440234389,0,cubmui5,null,t3_3hy6dj,null,null,null,t3_3hy6dj,null,null,null,1441401184,null,2,null,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2,null

 I grew up going to stands, but then when we moved to the U.S. In 92, I didn't attend another match at Anfield until the 95/96 season. 

Since then, I've been to a few matches spaced out every 3 years or so, as often as I can get back to England. 

Here's the thing - the atmosphere the last time I was there in 2011 was pretty dire, and it feels like the trend has largely continued. 

I think it's because there's now a generation of fans in their teens and twenties (presumably a large demographic at Anfield) who haven't experienced success and don't know what to do with themselves apart from a few chants and songs. I could be vastly off base here but the usual excuses of Ticket prices and tourists doesn't quite add up for me. 

So my point is I don't know if standing seating will change the atmosphere at Anfield. The only thing it seems like the fans respond to is a return to attacking football and results as in 13/14. 

So given that I don't think standing alone will change the atmosphere at Anfield, I think the risk of upsetting or hurting the Hillsborough families, or going against their wishes, is just too high. 

If this is something that could be tested at other venues, studied  and slowly adapted with Hillsborugh family consent, then yes, all for it.

Added bonus is that you can go straight into Cannon Hill park afterwards (it's on the same patch of land), which is a cool park in itself, it just got a new mini-golf course (I can't say how good it is, I haven't seen it completed, but my friend reckons it's cool), and there's also the MAC (Midlands Art Centre), which usually has a few exhibitions on at any given time.

If you park in the car park by the Wildlife Park, parking is free. If you're on the train, I think it's just 1 or 2 stops out from the city centre.

[Personally, I'd go with this] (http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=8g7h)

ST change -- was really out of Maiga, Lanzini or Lee. Either that or push one back, play with 2 attacking mids and a lone striker. But I've chosen Lanzini to play there as I think he'd do well there if he was played as a False Nine or thereabouts due to (from what I've seen of him anyways) how he isn't selfish and can pick out some decent passes. 

DM change -- Nothing against Oxford, but he didn't exactly have a great game against Leicester did he? When Obiang came on he looked quite good imo

GK change -- Randolph... didn't want to have it come to this. Hopefully he'll prove us wrong.

null,null,coriacea,null,null,null,"The point of a PS is to say why you want to study that course and to convince the lecturers to pick you to teach. Remember this with every sentence you write. You don't get many words, so if a sentence doesn't help towards that goal then get rid of it. You don't have space to waffle on. This might mean it's more difficult to get the whole thing to flow, but just write several fairly short paragraphs rather than long paragraphs that start on a topic and drift onto another relevant thing.

Look up things which you would study on those courses and mention why they interest you and why you want to learn more about them and any knowledge you already have of them if they're not covered at high school. Try and find something that all the courses cover or at least you could pick to do a project on. If you've read a certain book about a topic covered at uni but not school then this shows that you're keen and interested and passionate. Although make sure that if you get an interview, you have actually read that book as they may ask you about it. I was only half way through a book I had 'read', but by the time I would've had an interview, I had finished it.

You don't really need to mention hobbies or clubs you go to unless they're relevant to the course. Or unless you've managed to do exceptionally well at something out of school even if it's irrelevant. For example if your team makes it to a national event. I went to sea cadets and got cadet of the year for my unit so mentioned that (although sea cadets is vaguely relevant to my course). 

You can briefly mention slightly irrelevant things if they show that you've got a transferable skill or something that's useful in a lot of situations, including at uni. Such as working to a tight schedule. In my second year of uni, I had 5 weeks in November and December where I had a deadline for coursework or exam each week!

I got 5 offers without any interviews. Although to be honest I wish i had applied to one or two slightly better unis. If I got rejected from the top one then I would know that I reached my limit with the ones that i actually applied to. But maybe a slightly better uni would've taken me. Although not many unis do my kind of course, so they went from asking for all Cs to all As maybe AAB with no course asking for BBB, else I probably would've applied to that one.

It sounds very ""right on, man"", but I think there's a reason why children seem so predisposed to drawing the same landscape vista; a valley made of two hills, a river, a few scattered animals and some trees. I think that we naturally yearn to see those aspects in places for us to feel comfortable (after all, running water, some wood and some animals essentially meant survival back in paleolithic times).

To improve the spaces in which we live, I think we need to:

1) Ensure that the scale of space between and around buildings is kept within the 'human scale'. For example, open plazas need be scaled such that the maximum distances are such that they're within the longest distance the human eye can identify a person at the far end.

2) Incorporate as much flora like trees and crawling plants as possible. In turn, this attracts fauna such as insects and small mammals like leporids.

3) Include running water features occasionally.

Their point is that outside of their studies, they have engaged in trips around the world to learn more about other cultures. Their evidence is an example: their month in India which they spent travelling and doing charity work. Their explanation is that this demonstrates their interest in other cultures which they hope to develop at university.

Only pick four or five paragraphs. I tend to organise them like this:

1. What course you want to do and why.

2. Why you're academically brilliant for this course.

3. Something outside of school you've done relating to the subject.

4. Optional - a hobby or two which show how you're a rounded person and hard worker (sports or clubs are good here).

5. Why this course is important for your future plans.

Don't go on about how amazing you are, let your evidence speak for itself. Remember that you're saying that you should be accepted as a student, not an expert, and your experiences and enthusiasm will make you a worthy addition to the university.

null,null,IanCal,eng-manchester,Manchester - City of Science,null,"I think it's a little lazy to just say ""tiny number of jobs"". The article just jumps to saying it's a small number of jobs *compared to the environmental impact*, the paper doesn't seem to be talking at all about weighing up the costs of pollution, it's there to show the consequences.

So how many jobs? There are 26 open pit mines in the UK. The first on wikipedias list is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ffos-y-fran_Land_Reclamation_Scheme which has 200 employees and it says creates 400 jobs in the local area. If the employees come from Merthyr Tydfil (UKL15 if you want the NUTS3 code for looking up regional stats), that'd represent 2.4% of the current number of employees there (https://statswales.wales.gov.uk/Catalogue/Business-Economy-and-Labour-Market/People-and-Work/Unemployment/ILO-Unemployment/ilounemploymentrates-by-welshlocalareas-year). What impact will that have? Can we reasonably easily cover increases in unemployment like that or are sudden shifts on that scale highly detrimental? I have no idea. There must be good case studies of factories shutting down in areas like these though.

So maybe we're talking about 5000 jobs directly and 10000 in local areas, and then how much in the supply chain required to shift 10M tons of coal per year? That also should be compared to additional jobs required to import the coal, and the EU should consider the knock-on effects of increasing demand elsewhere (so while we see job losses, other places may see growth).

I don't really understand what it is people want, do you want the government to *not* understand the consequences of potential regulation? Not know which areas are going to be affected and by how much? That'd be highly irresponsible. How is providing that information to the EU *lobbying*?

What should be the process, do they get shut immediately? Or should we simply refuse any new planning but let the others run through their original plan and lifespan? Do we need targeted support from the EU for those areas? Are there things we can do *now* to smooth over problems rather than wait until things go to shit in an area?

Just because you look into and point out downsides of a plan, doesn't mean you don't go ahead with it.

Before I get accused of supporting keeping the mines open, this is all these articles are based on, saying that this is *covert lobbying*:

&gt; This “would therefore lead to the loss of the principal market for UK coal and the closure of the UK’s coal mines,” the paper says. “The mine closures would also lead to substantial job losses – directly and indirectly within the supply chain – in areas of the UK with significant levels of unemployment and socio-economic deprivation.”

That appears to be entirely factually accurate. The only sticking point may be ""substantial job losses"" depending on what you think they're arguing, but I think job losses in the thousands in focussed areas seems like a pretty reasonable use of the word.

And it doesn't mean we should keep them open. I would like to see us move away from coal, and particularly away from coal which causes worse pollution. I think the downsides are outweighed by the positives, but it's utterly dishonest to suggest there are *no* downsides and it would be downright dangerous to **not even bother to understand what the downsides are**.

I've got more actual figures here relating to the ""confidential lobbying"" than either of the articles do, and it's not hard to find.

Left-wing teachers do like the ""but the institution generally is biased, I'm just balancing things by teaching the other side"" excuse which is of course utter drivel. Ideally, a teacher should *never* be biased and should always seek to describe all sides of a debate or issue.

Once Lallana, Coutinho, Firmino start getting on the same wave-length and intuitively going for that second ball off Benteke we will be firing for sure. 

The other thing is Benteke becomes the focal point of the defence, and he's smart enough with his movement to use that to create space for others.

1. So it's 60 miles each way.

3. My car does 45 mpg so 120/45=2.7 gallons.

5. Price per litre of diesel = 110.9 pence. So that's 1.109 quid a litre * 12 = £13.31!

Which areas are affordable depend on where you work/study - if you have to commute to zone 1 every day, travel will be expensive. If you want some area recommendations, it might help letting us know which tube station is closest to your place of work/study? Also, I like [Find Properly](http://www.findproperly.co.uk/) to find areas within a decent travel distance - it doesn't have a lot of flat shares on it though (I think it just scrapes flats from Zoopla and Rightmove?). As someone mentioned - travel can be cheaper if you are &lt;25 or a full time student: you can buy a monthly (or yearly) travel card at 30% discount. 

The cheaper properties might look too good to be true, but though rare, there are still some decent landlords (I had one!). If you've got time to find a new place, you can be picky and find a nice place. As someone else suggested: maybe stay in a hostel (or with friends?) for a week or two at first.

There was a post the other day about how shit Maidstone is, and it's surely an illustration of what Ian Nairn described 60 years ago as subtopia: 

&gt; ‘the annihilation of the site, the steamrollering of all individuality of place to one uniform and mediocre pattern’ ... ‘the legalization of the urge to dump on a national scale.’ ... ‘its symptom will be … that the end of Southampton will look like the beginning of Carlisle; the parts in between will look like the end of Carlisle or the beginning of Southampton.’ [[illustration](http://www.architectural-review.com/Pictures/web/d/z/n/1WE_636.jpg)]

http://www.architectural-review.com/ian-nairn-the-pioneer-of-outrage/8661937.article

I suppose maybe you shouldn't blame the signs themselves, which are well designed, but the degree to which they are over-used, and perhaps the principle that things like this should be the same everywhere in the country.

Edit: As an aside, one big rationale for standardization is safety - that you can see a sign like that anywhere in the country and immediately understand what it means - but this this concept that safety always follows from separation from other road users, and certainty on the part of the drivers, is being questioned. If you have a wide road, you can see ahead to avoid accidents, but it also encourages you to drive faster. You don't necessarily want people to be able to drive through a village as if it was any stretch of road in the country, you want drivers to enter it with a degree of uncertainty, slow down, look around them carefully, and so on. For instance, there's now a shift back (pioneered in the Netherlands) to [shared-use road space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_space), where cars are expected to work their way around other road users, as much as the other way round.

Alienating players isn't only a Rosgers thing either, just take a look at other managers to see how players been 'alienated' is part of the job when you have to pick who plays, and which players are 'favourites' for a position. Example Mourinho. Mata was one of the best midfielders in the league before Mourinho returned to Chelsea. Mourinho comes back, favours Oscar for his work rate and Mata leaves for United. That's just one example on how a manager picking a player because they favour certain attributes that they posses.

Just because Sakho hasn't played the first two games doesn't mean he will never play again or can't work his way to first team. So far we have had the least amount of shots on target against us and have kept two clean sheets. So far this season Rodgers picking Lovren has worked out. Besides if Lovren has shown more in training than Sakho then he deserves a chance to prove himself. Same with some other players who aren't guaranteed staters. If Markovic shows he deserves a chance in training then he should get one.

The Lucas situation is similar to the example I gave above at Chelsea. Talented player who is very good at certain things in Lucas' case reading and breaking up the game, isn't favoured because the manager doesn't see those attributes as a priority.

null,null,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,null,"""The Labour leadership debacle continues as party higher-ups seek to suppress far left 'infiltrators', defending the party's status quo from the spectre of evolution. But who gives a party its mandate? The party's members and supporters or its executives? Have Harman, Burnham et al stopped to think that perhaps it's not their right to 'protect' the party from those seeking involvement with it? It can be confounding when democracy pulls society or an organisation in a direction you don't identify with. But that's the very nature of the system. I'm reminded of Liberal PM Herbert Asquith, who opposed suffrage for women because at the time as a bloc they tended conservative. He lost, women got the vote, and there was never a Liberal government again. The temptation to maintain ideological purity within a party by suppressing opposition has a long and unpleasant history - ask Trotsky. This is one of the many reasons I'm an anarchist and oppose party politics on principle, but whilst we're stuck with what we've got, let's recognise that people on the far left hoping to be able once again to support Labour aren't seditious, they're using the party's own democratic process to try and help it represent them, and with a Corbyn victory, thousands of people (and a majority of leadership election voters, let's not forget) will find themselves with a voice in parliament for the first time in over thirty five years. The conversion rate from registered supporters to full members will surely be high, and the party will have evolved, for better or worse, by the will of the British people.""",null,0,null,1440243237,null,null,false,0,cubpcfb,null,t3_3hu68k,null,null,null,t3_3hu68k,null,null,null,1441402426,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,null,ZekkPacus,eng-essex,Essex,null,"Histrionics aside, what this article is pointing out is that we had a person who was providing care for his children, but who was told he did not qualify as a full time carer, and has now been forced to surrender his children to social services.

The cost of caring for a child with cerebral palsy through the care system is probably not far shy of six figures a year, and the other child will be costing the system mid five figures. That's a much higher figure than the cost of paying the man DLA, carer's allowance and income support - I worked it out at around £15k a year, and that's assuming he was going to be getting the highest band of DLA and a mobility allowance on top of that. Obviously there would then be housing benefit and child benefits, but even the most generous figure wouldn't put him much north of £30k (I'm not sure if the benefits cap triggers when dealing with disability allowances).

So he was costing the tax payer £30k. You may say 'how does he deserve this money for free?' and maybe he doesn't. But the vast majority of it wouldn't have been for him, it would have been for the children. And now those same children are still costing the taxpayer, but now they're costing the taxpayer an easy £100k a year. Nearly a four-fold increase. Children in care do worse at school and have worse long-term prospects than children who remain with their families, assuming the family is not abusive. That increases the chances that these children will go on to underachieve and continue the whole cycle of low-paying job, no ambition, and undereducation leading to large families.

At the root of this is the Tory preoccupation with being tough on being poor whilst being very, very soft on the causes of being poor. It would be so easy for society, out of self-interest, to leave the children where they were and continue to support them at a reasonable cost. But we can't have that because it means someone is getting 'something for nothing'. Net result - a higher cost to the taxpayer, a higher chance of underachievement, and a grown man who probably feels like an utter failure.

I don't exactly know why but I would imagine that it's the same reason most Cities tend to be left-wing. A mixture of poorer people and younger people. I can't think of a major UK city (London, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Birmingham) that isn't left wing. 

Although we associate London with the rich these people make up a pretty small amount of the population. Even the rich but not super rich live on the fringes of the City in areas where they may or may not be close enough to vote. The rest of the city is made up of poorer districts like Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Barnet and Tottenham and younger areas like Camden, Islington and Brixton. It's a city in which Diane Abbot can have a safe seat!

null,null,vln,null,null,null,"Style guides for UK newspapers tend to be rather less conservative than American ones. We find it rather odd to read about ""Mr. Obama"" or ""Mr. Cameron"" in the NYT.

Acronyms which have come into common usage as a pronouncable word tend to lose their all-caps status. Hence ""Nasa"". ""HIV"" remains capitalised, but ""Aids"" does not. ""ISIS"" has indeed become ""Isis"" with some outlets (e.g. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/21/white-house-confirms-key-isis-leader-killed-us-air-strike), but ""IRA"" remains the same.

The Guardian's style guide gives some straightforward explanations for their decisions, including historical context, and extensive examples:

&gt; **abbreviations and acronyms**

&gt; Do not use full points in abbreviations, or spaces between initials, including those in proper names: IMF, mph, eg, 4am, M&amp;S, No 10, AN Wilson, WH Smith, etc.

&gt; Use all capitals if an abbreviation is pronounced as the individual letters (an initialism): BBC, CEO, US, VAT, etc; if it is an acronym (pronounced as a word) spell out with initial capital, eg Nasa, Nato, Unicef, unless it can be considered to have entered the language as an everyday word, such as awol, laser and, more recently, asbo, pin number and sim card. Note that pdf and plc are lowercase.

&gt; If an abbreviation or acronym is to be used more than once in a piece, put it in brackets at first mention: so Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), seasonal affective disorder (Sad); alternatively, use the abbreviation with a brief description, eg the conservation charity the RSPB. Remember that our international online readership will not necessarily be aware of even well-known UK abbreviations. If an organisation is mentioned only once, it is not necessary to give its abbreviation or acronym.

&gt; Cap up single letters in such expressions as C-list, F-word, ""the word assassin contains four Ss"", etc


&gt; **capitals**

&gt; *""I am a poet: I distrust anything that starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop""* (Antjie Krog)

&gt; Times have changed since the days of medieval manuscripts with elaborate hand-illuminated capital letters, or Victorian documents in which not just proper names, but virtually all nouns, were given initial caps (a Tradition valiantly maintained to this day by Estate Agents).

&gt; A look through newspaper archives would show greater use of capitals the further back you went. The tendency towards lowercase, which in part reflects a less formal, less deferential society, has been accelerated by the explosion of the internet: some web companies, and many email users, have dispensed with capitals altogether.

&gt; Our style reflects these developments. We aim for coherence and consistency, but not at the expense of clarity. As with any aspect of style, it is impossible to be wholly consistent – there are almost always exceptions, so if you are unsure check for an individual entry in this guide. But here are the main principles: ...

https://www.theguardian.com/info/series/guardian-and-observer-style-guide

And, on the F-word, including a superb quote at the end:

&gt; **swearwords**

&gt; We are more liberal than any other newspapers, using language that most of our competitors would not. The statistics tell their own story: the word ""fuck"" (and its variants) appeared 705 times in the Guardian in the 12 months to April 2010, with a further 269 mentions in the Observer. (The figures for other national newspapers were as follows: Independent 279, Independent on Sunday 74, Times 3, Sunday Times 2, all other papers 0.) The figures for the C-word, still regarded by many people as taboo, were: Guardian 49, Observer 20, Independent 8, Independent on Sunday 5, everyone else 0.

&gt; Even some readers who agree with Lenny Bruce that ""take away the right to say fuck and you take away the right to say fuck the government"" might feel that we sometimes use such words unnecessarily, although comments in response to Guardian Style's blogpost on the subject were overwhelmingly in support of our policy.

&gt; The editor's guidelines are as follows:

&gt; First, remember the reader, and respect demands that we should not casually use words that are likely to offend.

&gt; Second, use such words only when absolutely necessary to the facts of a piece, or to portray a character in an article; there is almost never a case in which we need to use a swearword outside direct quotes.

&gt; Third, the stronger the swearword, the harder we ought to think about using it.

&gt; Finally, never use asterisks, or such silliness as b------, which are just a cop-out, as Charlotte Brontë recognised: ""The practice of hinting by single letters those expletives with which profane and violent people are wont to garnish their discourse, strikes me as a proceeding which, however well meant, is weak and futile. I cannot tell what good it does – what feeling it spares – what horror it conceals""


As for this complaint:

&gt; When people who have no idea what NASA is sees ""Nasa"", they wouldn't know what it would be.

If you're targeting such a readership, you'd need to spell it out as ""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"". And maybe throw in a bit of Copernicus, too, just to be sure that they aren't straight out of the middle ages.

I disagree. Money buys a lot of power. I don't want people with a lot of power when they might not use it for the good of everyone.

The wealth disparity between the rich and the poor is pretty huge. It's growing. Something needs to be done. 

I'm not saying this is the answer. But to say something as ridiculous as the rich can be as rich as the want I think is a little silly.

null,null,chochazel,null,null,null,"&gt;Erm, then you could try not using smartphones at all?

You could, but you were the one suggesting using smaller companies as alternatives to companies like Apple, I'm just pointing out why that makes no sense.

&gt;I fins this whole conversation bizarre by the way, that myself, as someone who is generally right-leaning is defending the concept of ethical consumerism against quite a lot of left-leaning individuals.

You're doing it really badly and making terrible arguments; that's why you're getting down voted. It's got nothing to do with whether people are right or left leaning.  Both are down voting you!

You're assuming that every Occupy demonstrator was anti-capitalist, but then argued nuance when someone applied the same blanket generalisation to right-wingers.  Of course you can be against the worst excesses of capitalism without wanting to dismantle it.  The demonstrators were clearly specifically targeting the financial sector and the actions that led to the financial crisis.  That's why they went to the heart of the financial sector, not the manufacturing sector, or the catering sector! If they'd have been demonstrating against the catering sector it may be a different story, but a smaller coffee shop is not necessarily going to be sourcing their coffee more ethically or treating their workers any better, so even then your ""use smaller businesses"" argument makes no sense.

And criticising people for the goods that they use was always a ridiculous argument - it's literally impossible to get by without using products created by capitalism, it's literally impossible to get by without using services created by public services and so it doesn't make sense to shout hypocrisy at anyone for the goods and services they use.   That's the point that was being made and that's the point you're failing to argue well against.  People from all sides of the political spectrum can agree on that wholly reasonable conclusion, and so the fact that you fail to accept it draws contempt from all sides of the political spectrum.",null,0,null,1440245117,null,null,1440245381,0,cubpur3,null,t3_3hw3ah,null,null,null,t1_cubpn3i,null,null,null,1441402667,null,6,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

From a purely business perspective a ""resource"" that costs £1 million per year is different to one costing £25 thousand per year.  In any other type of contract the £1 million deal would require much more scrutiny and protections to make sure that the company gets value for money.  

But hiring is completely different than that.  As salary increases the risk to the employee is reduced and the risk to the company increases.  You get a highly incestuous relationship where good performance is attributed to management and poor performance to the lower paid work force.  There is very little penalty for failure.  It feels a lot like a monopoly where a cartel try and increase prices through artificial scarcity instead of competing properly.

Beyond a certain salary people should be treated as a separate business with contracts that protect the company.  It should always be possible to fire those people without any cost if they do not perform. 

An interesting approach would be to treat ""corporate governance"" in a similar vein to accounting or legal services.  You engage a trusted firm with experience to provide ""CEO services"".

Three Biology subjects and mixing in Chemistry are popular options, and many people do well in both. However if you are a bit hesitant over Chemistry I would personally do Evolution, as the three Biology subjects can complement each other a bit.   
 
One reason for doing chemistry would be if you are certain of going on to Biochemistry, but I have often seen people change their minds on what they want to do. I wanted to be a Biophysicist at first, and ended up as a Plant Scientist.    

If you still want to integrate some physical science with your biology, consider having a look at Earth Sciences? From what I hear it goes well with Evolution.

Oh yes I do!  In fact I can truthfully say that I have infinitely more times more information than you (unless you're down voting yourself)!  That didn't seem to stop you assuming that they're all left wingers!  But if you want to delude yourself that this is the only reason you're being down voted, don't let me stop you!

&gt;Secondly, I don't want to go in to detail, but there is a broad correlation between the occupy movement and more general anti-capitalist and anti-consumerist movements. I don't think this is a controversial statement.

It's the very point you're supposed to be debating so by failing to engage with it, you're losing the argument.  Correlation is a very weak term anyway!  Of course some of them are, but then some right wingers are anti public services, but as you've already pointed out, that doesn't describe all right wingers.  It's like you're arguing against yourself!

&gt;I am not saying that people can get by without using any products of capitalism...I am saying that they can get by - by making ethical choices about which companies they purchase from. Again, this is not a controversial statement

Not particularly, but then that would have absolutely nothing to do with protests relating to the financial crisis which had precisely nothing to do with that.  

Lots of different people can hold a whole bunch of different views about lots of different things.  If the anti-tax protestors had been using Starbucks, you'd have a point, if people campaign against cruelty to animals and then eat a McDonalds veal burger, you'd have a point, but these people were specifically protesting the financial sector so you *really* don't.

You're basically ascribing a whole bunch of views to people in blanket terms, and then getting very upset when others do the same thing back.

So? We won the league, does it matter what kind of mentality took us there? 

&gt; Poor transfer period. Started with Cech leaving. Im not saying we shouldnt let him go, Im saying that the deal could have been done far earlier.

Why should it have been done earlier? We got Begovic in time for the preseason and, other than the preseason match against NYRB, he has been an excellent back up for us. 

&gt; We didnt have a complete team, and I'm talking about a team where every position has at least two players competing for it.

We didn't have that last season either, did we? In preseason, or in the league. Even so, Jose didn't even seem to want to rotate much. 

&gt; We sold Premiership's best left back in order to bring in expensive alternative. 

How can Luis be the best left back if a natural right back (Azpi) can keep him out of the team?

&gt; I mean, we had team so complacent from only winning the league that our greatest preseason performer was Moses. 

I would say lack of match fitness also played a factor. 

&gt; Ivanovic witch-hunt is completely legitimate. 

No. He has been such a great servant to the club for so long that a ""witch hunt"" is unfair. Yes, he has been poor this season but everyone has crappy games or gets worse when they're older, and the way this sub has crucified him for that is pretty low. 

I'm not saying he doesn't deserve criticism, and we can replace him with Azpi/Rahman, but don't go on a ""witch hunt""

&gt; He can not deal with fast left wingers anymore, at least not while having attacking duties.

Yeah, he's slow. So is Terry. 

&gt; Mikel could if he wanted, but he doesnt. 

Matic is a far stronger and better player than Mikel, so I don't think he can cover for the Matic role, but he's better than Ramires defensively. Which is why Jose brings him on when we need to defend a lead.

&gt; And what we do is we buy in the area we are completely covered. Attacking midfield.

Do you mean Pedro? I don't think we were completely covered in attacking mid before him at all. Fabregas isn't good playing as a #10, Cuadrado has been useless so far, Willian has no attacking creativity at all, so that leaves Oscar and Hazard. Pedro is a great purchase because he will give us exactly what we need, especially on the right wing. 

&gt; Carneiro saga just reflects the bad state of the club at the moment.

Handled poorly by the club and Carneiro, but everyone's moved on now.

null,null,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,null,"The 'build homes at any [social] cost' idea has been done countless times before. Every time there's a centralised push for rapid expansion of the housing stock, it ends with places no one wants to live in.

It happened in the 1950s with the post-war efforts to clear inner-city slums. Urgency to address a housing shortage, together with (misguided) optimism in the form of Futurism resulted in hostile piss-soden concrete tower blocks. They're such a resounding failure, they are today being demolished just 60 years into their estimated 250 year lifespan.

It happened again in the mid-to-late 1960's to address the baby-boom, but this time in the form of car-dependent suburban council estates. The density of urban housing was exchanged for the low-density swathes of semi-detached social housing that was ultimately occupied by only one social group (the less well-off in the working class likely to vote Labour). Today they manifest themselves as hotspots of deprivation for that very reason.

It happened in the Million Programme in Sweden around the same time; centralised planning targets on light, minimum distances from carriageway and public green space targets resulted in places like Rosengård that have turned a whole generation to depression.

What is needed is grass-roots building of homes by people with a vested interest to love the new places. This is done by creating general loose planning principles centrally, then delegating to local authorities the ability to craft the planning regulations to fit local needs, and then ultimately empowering individual families and small outfits to build homes as they feel they need them.",null,0,null,1440247802,null,null,false,0,cubqo6n,null,t3_3hy4kr,null,null,null,t1_cubpy0k,null,null,null,1441403051,null,15,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15,null

By a conservative estimate 2,000 customers come through my shop each day. I could poison each and every one of those customers.

Campylobacter has an incubation period of between 2-5 days, so I could theoretically poison 6,000 people before the first person even notices anything's wrong.

Campylobacter causes severe food poisoning and can cause death if not treated well. Imagine the knock on effect of the local economy if 6,000 workers are suddenly stuck at home on the toilet for up to 10 days.

And were I a chef, all I'd have to do to potentially infect a large number of people with campylobacter is not give a shit about the chicken I'm cooking. Or even worse not understand the guidance, and continue washing the chicken, and then use the same sink to prepare some vegetables.

EDIT: Or Norovirus. All I've got to do is catch that and go to work. Takes 12-48 hours to incubate.

**From a corporation.**

There's no such thing as ""ethical consumption."" It's not possible under capitalism.

Even if you do go into the woods and start your own hippie commune, you will have been forced at some point to purchase some good or service from a company.

That company will have purchased computer equipment, even if it's just a calculator.

That computer equipment will have been built in slave labor conditions by Foxconn or some other horrific Asian industrial company.

So by even purchasing seed so that you can set up your own hippie vegan commune free of any kind of interaction with capitalism, you will still have directly contributed to human slavery.

Applying your ethics to consumerism is an act of selfishness designed to soothe your own consciousness. So long as you recognize that you have no actual power or agency within the capitalist system, you're fine.

But we delude ourselves into thinking that we have some power or choice over what corporations offer us, some ability to punish or reward them outside of governmental controls. We don't.

Companies will buy stuff from other companies more than people will. Even boycotting can't really work anymore. If no individual person purchased anything from Koch industries, they wouldn't notice. Other companies will still stock their break rooms with solo cups, still buy industrial equipment, still interact with them. Because no corporation cares about the ethics of its purchases, it cares about having a competitive advantage.

Unlike you I am actually able to set my bias aside and think rationally. Look at my first response I don't agree with Rodgers not playing a defensive midfielder. You are clouded by your irrational hatred of our clubs manager and have never said anything positive about him.

&gt;I didn't hear you grumble about Sakho last year when he was saving Brendans arse.

Why would I moan about a player performing well? I actually want the team to succeed something I don't think you agree with because you would rather see us and Rodgers fail just to suit your narrative. If Sakho out-performs Lovren why would I have a problem with him playing? If Lovren doesn't deserve a start then he shouldn't, simple. But at the moment I think he's been playing well and actually does deserve a chance in the team.

Besides I don't get why Skrtel is somehow immune from all this as he's played worse than Lovren in the past two games. So I would actually rather have Lovren and Sakho playing instead of Skrtel. But like I said at the moment I think our defence has done well and deserves to get a run of games going. If one of Skrtel or Lovren starts performing poorly then give Sakho or even Ilori a chance in the team.

&gt;Great that we've won 2. Is it down to Lovren? You wish. An elbow on an opponent, clearances to opposition runners, getting caught out of space, nervous defending and a lucky call. Can do much better

Only early but we have the best defensive record in the league so far. Where's the problem in that? Why can't you just give credit where it's due? Not everything has to be a negative.

He brings innovation and players. There are players that would want to join City for the chance to play under Pep that wouldn't join for Pellegrini, and he keeps the opposition on their toes, which was obviously an issue for us last year. He also has experience with a club that focuses on youth development (look at how he got rid of some big stars early on at Barca). That being said, if CFG brought him in, they would be like putty in his hands considering how long they've wanted him, which would either mean he's in it for the long haul since he will have the reins to the club, or we could be devastated if he leaves early. As much as he offers, I think that stability is invaluable in the Premier League, and I think Pellegrini could very well be our Ferguson or Wenger. Even though Pep has used youth in the past, he has also almost completely thrown Bayern's youth out of the window to bring in ""his players"". I'm not entirely sure what we'd get with Pep, but whatever it is, it would be exciting. I'd hate to see him go to a rival club, since it seems like he won't be returning to Bayern after this year, but I'm not sold on what he could do for us.

Even Codeine (syrup) has some pretty killer withdrawals surprisingly, after a year or so of abuse. Got through it in once piece though. 

&gt;I'm not sure what the difference between codeine and codone is other than maybe how its suspended in a solution or pill form or maybe the addition of acetaminophen.

Codeine is derived from a natural poppy alkaloid and hydrocodone is a semi synthetic derivative of that and is much stronger. It metabolizes differently in the liver IIRC. Hydrocodone is roughly on par with Oxy from a pain relief POV, whereas anything with -codeine is much much weaker. 

Speaking on the UK/US thing, the US is rife with Oxy and other opiates in comparison. In the UK it seems ridiculously hard to get anything close to Oxy, even if you're in pretty bad pain.

Laptop is in used condition. A few cosmetic signs of use and a couple of scratches, but I thoroughly cleaned the cooling system. Runs at below 70c under extreme loads. It has no hard drive or OS but if you want I can grab a 750gb HDD for it and install win10 for the right price.

CPU: i7 4700MQ
GPU: GTX 765m
RAM: 16GB 1600MHz
Screen: 15.6in 1920*1080 matte finish
It also has two 2.5in HDD bays and 1 M.2 slot

I'm currently in South/Central London. I'd prefer not to ship as I don't have the original box so shipping will be kinda difficult. If you need me to ship I'll probably use an old GTX 970 box.

Accepting good offers. I will also trade it for an ultrawide 3440*1440 or a 2560*1440@144 G Sync monitor

Basically, we can suspend payments and terminate awards. Suspension usually happens to prompt a claimant into doing something, and are usually lifted. Terminations happen when we've decided that the claimant is getting money they aren't entitled to. The vast majority of times the decisions are correct based on the available information - but he decision may be overturned if the claimant then provides us with further information.

Say if we end a claim, but the claimant makes a successful appeal. That appeal process may take several weeks to several months. Meaning that in many cases people lose there only source of income. Though a lot also tend to have another form of benefit that is unaffected - JSA, ESA, DLA, etc. But some are completely dependant on tax credits. And we only end claims after a claimant has been given sufficient opportunity to provide us with evidence in support of the claim.

Most common reason for ending a claim? Couldn't say. Bit there are several remits that cover relationship status, children, childcare, work, hours of work, income, disability, etc. Some don't terminate - they may just take one of the 'elements' away. I'm 'undeclared partner' at present, and we don't adjust awards - if someone is claiming money they aren't entitled to we'll end the claim outright from 'the earliest date' - usually the beginning of the tax year.",null,0,null,1440252334,null,null,false,0,cubsdjs,null,t3_3hymbu,null,null,null,t1_cubs3vl,null,null,null,1441403855,null,3,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

TBH, I think the OUTRAGE over this one tweet is because Corbyn supporters desperately want to have it confirmed that the allegations linking Corbyn to antisemitism is nothing more than the product of right-wing smears.  But, I think these people are wrong.  There really is a link, and Mensch has been at the forefront in exposing it.

But either way, your impact is invisible.

If 80% of the human race coordinated in purchasing, our impact would still be minimal.

We don't have enough wealth to matter anymore. The corporations and the wealthy are the ones who have enough purchasing power to make a difference.

This isn't defeatist. This is recognizing the problem, so that we can actually solve it. That means ending these trade agreements and working together with other nations on the national, governmental, and international levels to restrict predator multinationals. First, by removing their influence over our governments, and second, by using a new wave of antitrust laws to break them into more manageable pieces, and forcing their wealth to work for all of us, and not just the few.

Only when we recognize the problem can we solve it.

Consumption is a major part of that problem. As is planned obsolescence, which exists to drive consumption. Mass consumption cannot be a method used to solve the problem, because it itself is part of the problem.

The difference between WW2 and the Troubles is that by and large the IRA didn't plant bombs in England, they did a bit but mostly it was in NI. They didn't go for politicians as much as civilians and at the end of the day they were attacking ordinary people of Northern Ireland more than anyone else. Like in WW2 everyone fought the Nazis. Yes there were bad things done, but they weren't done to the Allies (again generalising but I think it's obvious what I mean) they were done to the enemy. 

As for not seeing the difference between conscript and volunteer I have to believe that's just wilful ignorance.

First Half

MIN |  | Event |  | Player | | Description
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
||
7' || Misc || Davies || Davies has a poor touch and is seemingly sealed off the ball. [He doesn't give up, however, and dives around his man to keep the ball in play.](http://gfycat.com/SelfishElasticKiwi)
29' | | Chance for Spurs | | Dembele | | [Dembele beats two defenders and unleashes a nice and low near post shot that Schmeichel gets enough on.](http://gfycat.com/JauntyAdorableIbis)
29' || Yellow || Dembele || After being dispossessed, [Dembele fouls his man](http://gfycat.com/DampFatherlyDoctorfish) and earns the first yellow of the game.
31' || Yellow || Lamela || [Lamela is very late](http://gfycat.com/ChiefRegularAsianlion) on a challenge on Schlupp and is deservedly booked.
42' || Misc || Vertonghen || [Vertonghen puts hearts in mouths,](http://gfycat.com/JollyRemoteFruitfly) as he catches Mahrez's foot in the box, after pulling his shirt. Reminiscent of his play against Leicester the last time these two played at the King Power stadium.

Second Half

:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
||
48' || Chance for Spurs || Chadli || A great ball from Walker leads Chadli into some open space, but [he badly misses the goal from a moderately difficult angle](http://gfycat.com/BigBigheartedAmericancrow). He doesn't have to score, but he at least has to challenge the keeper there.
57' || Misc || Lloris || Schmeichel smartly takes a quick goal kick following a failed Tottenham corner while the defenders are out of position. [Lloris goes miles off his line](http://gfycat.com/CourteousScrawnyBluebottlejellyfish) to head the ball out of bounds.
60' || Yellow || Dier || After Lamela is dispossessed, Leicester break on a counter that's stopped by [a Dier professional foul](http://gfycat.com/CraftyConsciousFlee).
63' || Chance for Spurs || Kane || A dinked ball from Mason finds Kane, who nearly beats three defenders. [Somehow, he still gets a weak shot off](http://gfycat.com/AltruisticDrearyElephant) after being closed down by a fourth defender.
69' || Misc || Dembele || Some highlights of one of Moussa's best qualities, as [Dembele refuses to lose possession](http://gfycat.com/FirsthandImpassionedCrab), battling multiple defenders over the course of 10 seconds. 
81' || Goal for Spurs || Alli || Kane makes a great turn, finds Chadli, whose return ball to Kane is too long but finds an unmarked Dele Alli at the far post who [finishes with his head for his first Premier League goal](http://gfycat.com/LateHappygoluckyAfricanrockpython). [Alternate angles + celebration.](http://gfycat.com/FearfulExhaustedFennecfox)

Seeing as this is the situation we currently have I'd guess this is what has prompted this max  wage discussion.

Importantly this maximum wage should only really apply to  employees. If it's your business than you are exempt.

Larger companies where shareholders have little say in exec pay awards as the company shares are held by other institutions eg pension management are held to ransom by a network of directors all with numerous directorships sitting simultaneously on multiple boards engaging in an arms race of exec pay with no controls or checks.
This in turn affects the public sector where we have to offer ridiculous rates to entice council leaders, often earning more than the Prime minister over to ""run"" a council.

I think the primary incentive for a political career should be the career itself - what changes one can bring to issues that one cares about.

Take my city council's leader, for example. Now, disregarding the fact that our labour council is strapped for cash (perhaps as a result of the coalition government and the subsequent Tory one?), Nick Forbes is the embodiment of my point. The guy drives a cheap two door hatchback, and makes as much as a mid-level manager. Instead of T Dan Smith, whom drove around in a custom reg Jag, had expensive dinner parties and wore the finest suits. Forbes buys his clothes at the same supermarkets, high street stores and tailors that the rest of us do. 

The result of that? He cares very deeply about our city. He allegedly donated a chunk of his salary to one of our local public services *just so it could stay open*. That bag of change could have been a holiday, or a kitchen remodel, or some other personal means of physical self gratification. 

He gave an interview late last year, and spoke of the budget that had been allotted to us. Instead of distancing himself from it, he became physically ill thinking about the cuts that are being made to support the budget.

null,null,HasuTeras,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,null,"I mean, it's pretty funny and a good post. But seriously lets look at some of the fucking weird shit that Corbyn has done over the years. 

He was ahead of the times on South Africa, but I don't really think that counts for much given that at the same time the Tory government was lobbying for the dismantlement of Apartheid

&gt;in June 1984, the notes taken by Botha’s foreign minister show that she [Thatcher] told him “very firmly” that “apartheid had to be dismantled, Mandela and other prisoners released” and the “forcible removal of urban blacks had to stop”

This stance on South Africa, is used quite frequently by Corbyn supporters as a way to say that he was also ahead of the curve on the Troubles and his association with PIRA memebers. But he wasn't lobbying for a peace process in Northern Ireland, he was lobbying for the abandonment of NI such that it could be subsumed by the Republic of Ireland. Which is ludicrous considering that about half (roughly still that number today) of Northern Irish want to remain a part of the UK. Even if, even if for one second he was genuinely serious about the peace process (in a way that didn't involve complete surrender of territory), I still find the fact he invited convicted IRA bombers to parliament **two weeks** after the IRA had attempted to assassinate the prime minister (and actually killed and maimed several innocent civilians) to be incredibly fucking distasteful. Can you imagine if someone invited Anjem Choudry to give a talk about blasphemy, 2 weeks after Charlie Hebdo?

He does have a really fucking murky past about meeting with individuals / terrorists who perpetrate attacks on civilians. The Spectator article on him raised a great point, '*you could associate yourself with constitutional nationalists like the SDLP or you could pal around with Sinn Fein, the IRA and the republican movement*'. That point really does apply to his associations with Hamas members.

He buddies around pretty much only with terrorists who are politically opposed to the West. 

I've said it before, Corbyn belongs to a section of the left which is self-flaggelatory and believes that the West is *always* in the wrong, and he will always leap at the opportunity to point out some failing of the West while minimizing the failings of non-Westerners. Seriously, look up his comments on NATO / Ukraine. Or look at [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRqOQfSw8vA&amp;t=) and what he says about ISIS.

&gt;'**some** of what ISIS has done is **quite** appalling

and then launches into a tirade about US military conduct in Fallujah, conflating the two as if they are comparable. ISIS have created a literal totalitarian, theo-fascistic state which has codified sex slavery and legal rape of non-believers, where they execute and commit atrocities day by day. How hard is it to just say 'yes they are awful' and leave it at that? What is the need to bring the US into it?

null,null,Metal-Dog,null,null,null,"Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game with 3 factions.  Three ""home planets"" which are filled with various PvE areas for level-grinding and skill-building, as well as gathering resources for crafting.  A ""battle planet"" on which all three factions battle against each other to take control of various fortresses.

One faction would be exclusively Dalek.  Another would be Humans and friendly races.  The third could be a mish-mash of various other aliens such as Cybermen and Zygons, etc..  Each race or variation would have certain specialties and abilities and weapons.  Various ""quests"" on the home planets that would tell the lore of each race, and reward the players with fancy gear.

ideas for playable ""races"":

Medieval Knight: wears armor and deals heavy melee damage.  ranged attack with crossbows.  can craft siege weaponry and deploy it on the battlefield.  Can fight on horseback.

WWII Soldier: uses guns and grenades and mortars.  can craft and operate military vehicles to deploy on the battlefield.  Specializing in vehicle skills will eventually allow you to make tanks.  Specializing in marksmanship will give you sniper skills.

Time Lord:  carries a sonic screwdriver that can hack or destroy enemy technology, temporarily disable enemy weapons, reveal shapeshifters and dalek ""puppets"", unlock any door, and emit bursts of ""doctoring"" energies that restore health to allies.  also restores health and stamina to allies by shouting out encouraging words like ""Braveheart, [name]!"" and ""I have a plan!  Sort of...""  Is also equipped with ""time bombs"" that can either be thrown or set as landmines, which temporarily freeze enemies in a time lock.  If a Time Lord dies, when he (or she) respawns he (or she) will have a new appearance.

Silurian:  Because some players will want to be green.  Uses cloaking device to turn invisible.  Has weird Silurian weapons and can also do that tongue thing.  If you specialize in a certain skill set you can command a group of two or three Silurians at the same time.

Tetramillenials:  31st Century humans.  Rocket boots and laser guns.  Specializing in Gear Tech gives you better guns and better flying tech.  Can craft multiple K9 units that can be sent into battle or told to stay in one spot and defend it.  Specializing in robotics gives you better K9s and more of them.

Aliens:

Cybermen:  heavily armored to withstand a lot of damage.  can specialize in cybermat control and deploy an army of little drones into battle, or rank up the skills in weaponry and get bigger and better guns and melee skills, or specialize in armor tech and make various improvements to the mechanical bodies of yourself and other friendly cyberunits.

Zygon:  Shapeshifting allows for easy infiltration of enemy bases.  Can render opponents unconscious with a single touch and take their appearance.  Venom sacs in the tongue if they need to kill.  There would be two specializations in shapeshifting: one would involve the ability to remember the faces you've worn in the past, with higher training giving you a wider range of appearances into which you can instantly morph.  the other would involve being able to morph into any object and hide in plain sight, with higher training allowing you to recall objects that you've been before.

Sontaran:  If you specialize in Cloning, you can clone yourself and play as two or three Sontarans at the same time.  Specializing in Armor will allow you to improve your own armor as well as craft better armor for other Sontarans.  Specializing in weaponry will allow you to craft massive battle machines on the battlefield, such as missile turrets and tanks.

Siren:  ok, the aliens need a Healing class and the best I can come up with is the holographic nurse character from Curse of the Black Spot.  So, basically you could play as a holographic ghostly girl who floats around in a wet nightgown.  You can heal allies, defend yourself with a banshee shriek, teleport to any reflective surface, etc.

Archangel:  a slight variation on the Weeping Angels.  The Archangel is the male of the species.  While being made of living stone, their wings are actually useful for flight, and they can still move while being observed.  They do melee battle using stone weapons that resemble spiked clubs.  They can restore their own health by leeching time energy from opponents.  Unlike the female of the species, archangels can not move opponents back in time, but with the proper training they can eventually learn to leech enough life out of opponents to age them to death.  Specializing in flight will allow the archangel to fly faster and perform special aerial attacks.

Daleks:

Special Weapons Dalek:  Heavy armor.  Heavy weapons capable of mass destruction.  Incapable of any kind of levitation.  Can blast through walls and destroy enemy weapons, but has limited range.  Can either specialize in either weaponry or armor tech.

Aerial Dalek:  Sits on a flying battle platform for faster, longer, and higher flight.  Has long-range laser weapons and can drop bombs.  Can specialize in either flight or weapons.

Dalek:  Limited levitation abilities but it can get over a wall or up a staircase.  Disruptor ray insta-kills any organic beings.  Specializing in Troop Tactics allows the player to control two or three Daleks at the same time.  Specializing in weaponry allows the player to improve the Dalek gun, eventually being able to blast through doors or chain-exterminate multiple targets with a single shot.

Dalek Tech:  Deploys nanogenes to repair and heal nearby Daleks.  Can remote hack or destroy enemy tech and instantly unlock doors.

Dalek Puppeteer:  Leaves his shell and climbs into the corpse of an enemy combatant, taking on some of their skills and abilities and weapons.  Is easily able to infiltrate enemy fortresses in this manner.

Add to all this the ability to customize your character in many ways (except Time Lords whose appearance is always random, including their taste in clothing), cool gear and ranks and a decent crafting system.  The ""home world"" experience could closely resemble a survival game, in which characters must gather resources in various ways to build or buy their own houses, craft or buy their weapons and equipment, and supply themselves with food and water.  Various ""quests"" would be available, in which the player would be sent off to their own little single-player adventure that is pertinent to whatever class or race they have chosen.  There could also be multiplayer quests that train teams of players to work together.  There could also be competitive missions in which two teams face off against each other.

I would agree, but this is the sub that thinks voting Conservative is roughly equivalent to genocide and that Corbyn is absolutely perfect, so a long way from what the country actually thinks - and what actually works.

&gt; Though I must stress that the fact that people in this society get paid upwards of £200,000/yr while others are struggling to raise a family on £20,000 sickens me.

It's never good that people are struggling for money, but 'people earn lots' is a really shitty reason. Most of those people are highly paid *for a reason*, it's not that they just got to the front of the line in the job centre and were made CEO of Lloyds or something and the next guy works in Asda.

&gt; Often the people earning &gt;£25,000 work the hardest of all and have the toughest decisions to make.

If people are working overly hard for their money, it indicates that the pay is poor - **not** that we should take it out on the high earners.

And fairly sure that the tough decisions are due to poorer than needed pay; if you want to give people pay cuts **because they're rich** then that's stupid.",null,0,null,1440256505,null,null,false,0,cubua9y,null,t3_3hye47,null,null,null,t1_cubu40d,null,null,null,1441404754,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Sorry, city fan peaking at your pre-match thread. Kolarov's defensive weakness is massively overstated, we've kept 6 clean sheets in the last 8 games he's played, and he's played a massive part of it. Made a lot of last minute blocks and last week Hazard swapped wings to try and get at him and got absolutely nothing at all. 

With Kolarov, you get a decent period of fantastic form until he has nailed down his place over clichy, then he gets lazy and form goes down, but I don't think we're at that stage yet. 

2 of your goals came from down the Southampton left hand side though so it will be an interesting area of the game. ",null,0,null,1440257895,null,null,false,0,cubuzez,null,t3_3hvkwn,null,null,null,t1_cub3erv,null,null,null,1441405083,null,5,null,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5,null

null,null,Carlswaen,null,null,null,"Presumably they're saying 120 because either somebody else is doing 110, or they realise that if they say X amount is good, then people will consistently hit what is considered average.     

Sounds like they're deliberately setting higher and higher targets because people will work that much harder just trying to get close.  Can't see any problem with that.  The more pickups the fewer people you need to hire, the wider the company margins.  Say 120 and get 80.  Push for 80 and get 60.  Setting impossible expectations as a parent might be considered abusive.  Setting impossible standards as a company, contractor, or employer is a stratagem.

It's a warehouse job, the only way to make it semi-enjoyable is to allow people to not hustle.

I'm open minded and I'm listening, because I use both Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.fr A LOT and I would source elsewhere if I thought there was a genuine cause for concern but I'm not actually hearing anything why they aren't a stellar company.  If it's staff whose sole job is in the warehouse and their required skill is being able to get boxes, then of course they're going to push for more boxes faster and presumably it's the only reason why the job exists.  If you're not in the fastest quartile of box-picker-uppers, they should have an issue with you, and if someone is in the slowest quartile of box-picker-uppers then by rights the company should replace them.

You mean the one the eurosceptics refused to vote on and could've stopped?

&gt; Outside the European Union, the Government could use the money we pay every year to the European Union for membership for investment in policing

Yeah, the government totally took huge cuts to the police force *to pay for the EU*. And if we get back that however much we pay for membership, that'll clearly go directly into public service.

&gt; Big businesses have been able to lobby the European Union for their own benefit, pushing up your energy bills.

Wasn't it found the energy companies were ripping everyone off anyway? They're doing that independent of the EU.

&gt;  Being part of the European Union means that
&gt; food prices have increased because of the food subsidies given to farmers in other countries

they...have?

I also have no clue where this £933 comes from. It seems to say 'we should spend the bureaucratic money on services' (which is...fine, I guess? it's a tiny proportion though) but somehow get a huge amount of money for the household.

Unless that's £1000 of food price increases...

EDIT: An afterthought: The **major** issue always brought up with the EU is free travel. UKIP's main line was - IMHO - bringing everything back to immigration and our inability to change that easily whilst we remained in the EU. Regardless of whether this is a good or bad thing, surely a point that major would be a swing point for the no campaign?

&gt; 
&gt; The traveller asked the guard twice but later reported him to Translink claiming the G4S worker had twice told him: “I don’t know what you’re on about mate.”
&gt; 
&gt; The disgruntled traveller made a complaint to Translink about the conduct of the worker and said he had been sectarian. 

The full exchange itself isn't recorded in the article but the usage of ""Londonderry"" isn't being speculated upon by either the author or a third party nor the individual concerned. Rather the usage of ""Derry"" which was seemingly ignored by the individual. Now this is very nuanced and may be a little complex for someone with a fancy English Degree but as someone with a *solitary GSCE in Bellendry* it is really quite simple.

Credit to Bilic; he was able to turn things around after the half.  We weren't any good at that under Sam, largely because Sam never changed tactics -- but that's beside the point.

Apart from Reid (who had one or two shaky moments himself, honestly), the entire defense was abysmal.  They hung Randolph out to dry for every single goal (if you count the penalty Jenks gifted them).

Speaking of... Randolph actually MOTM for me.  More than a few crucial saves to try and keep us in it.

null,null,pastpresentfuror,null,null,null,"A few talking points


1. I've been one of Lamela's biggest defenders, but I'm ready to give up on him. He's finally given the number ten and he bottles it massively. There were times where I saw him walking in our third while the rest of the team was on attack. He made 2 or 3 bright plays, but other than that, completely anonymous. If anyone comes in with anywhere near 20m for him, he should go.

2. Davies is ostensibly playing because he is the better defender out of him and Rose and he had a huge challenge marking the form player in the league, but he was wasteful, made ill-advised runs forward, and made easy tackles look desperate. Hopeful that we'll see Rose next week.

3. Kane is immense. He was full of running, was by far the biggest creative influence on the team, and his turn and let off for the goal was world class. We need Berahino (and hopefully a third new attacker to replace Lamela), desperately.

4. Which leads me to my final point, the reason Kane looks so good is because he is surrounded by one dimensional underperforming players. Eriksen is very tidy, but he can and does also go completely anonymous for large parts of games and is a straight up defensive liability (both of which are fine in a good system, imo). The rest of our attackers are so limited. Chadli can bang them in, but don't ask him to ever beat a man. Lamela is bordering on useless. On the bench we have a host of also-rans and untested youth. This team is highly unbalanced, and is suffering from having to rely on underperformers showing something they never have. We are currently relying on Lamela to develop a footballing brain, on Dembele to start scoring, on Dier to play a role he never has in his career, on Vertonghen to regain his form from three seasons ago, and, as much as I hate saying it, on Harry to completely avoid the sophomore slump. That is too much up in the air. None of the sides above us or around us have that many question marks. Maybe the stars will all align and we will perform, but I don't have much faith in that, really.

null,null,rjm101,null,null,null,"&gt; Sometimes I think why should we bother saving anything as we have little control over our lives - such as a tragedy if you saved for your retirement all your life and died early.

Save enough so you have an emergency fund which should be about 6 months of expenses in the event for example you loose your job and need to keep up with the rent payments whilst you find another job or a whole bunch of other unforseen costs. This is essentially to keep you off the streets and should be plenty of motivation for you.   
Once you've done this then save your money into a cash ISA or stocks and shares ISA and work towards growing your savings where your gains will be tax free. Some aim to save for a deposit on a flat/house.   
Also put some money aside into your workplace pension which you should get from your employer. You will pay into it and so will your employer. Normally this is a small contribution that adds up throughout your working life into a decent retirement fund.

**Positives:**

- We have a striker, and a damn good one at that. 

- Ayew is an absolute pest in the box. Never looks marked.

- Siggy looking dangerous again. Unlucky not to score that left footed attempt.

- Fernandez was great, our only defender that seemed to keep his composure in the box.

- Shelvey and Cork are the spine of this team. They look confident and their play is consistent. Hope they stay for years to come.

**Negatives:**

- Passing. Not much to be said here it, it was shite.

- Fullbacks were dreadful. Fletcher and Lens might as well have been Messi and Pele. Lens carved us open about a dozen times

- Defensive organization. We looked like a mess at the end of that game and could have easily been punished for it by a better team

- Complacency. The lads didn't look like they were giving the effort they gave against Chelsea today. I understand it's harder to get motivated to play Sunderland, but they completely outworked us today. We aren't Bayern, we have to give that Chelsea effort every game to reach our lofty ambitions

- Referees consistency. Someone should have been sent off. Between Cattermole, Van Aanholt and Lens I have no idea how a second yellow wasn't given. Additionally there were more than a few dubious decisions. I recognize that we got lucky with the handball call, but I think the tackle of Eder warrented a penalty as well. Just dreadful officiating in my opinion. That said we were nippy as well and I don't think the awful refereeing targeted any team specifically.

Mason and Dier is a pretty poor midfield combo; they both lack technical ability and slow our game down a ton.  I don't know what Bentaleb has done to have lost his starting spot, but I'd really like to see him back for the next game.

I'm also not a fan of Dembele at right wing.  He has abysmal end product and is slow.He might be worth a shot a cm with Bentaleb, given his tackling, strength, and ability to keep possession. He's certainly got better ball skills than Dier.  

People are going to slam Lamela, but it's worth noting everyone in midfield was shit today. We badly missed Eriksen.

Vertonghen was poor today, but he has always struggled in one v ones, and Davies was pretty poor, both defensively and offensively.  Rose is much better imo, and I hope he gets the nod for next week (is he injured?).

I find that Liverpool has a lot more trees and grassland incorporated into places and it is very nice for this reason, my main complaint about living in London other than money issues was that all I could see was concrete and concrete wherever I went.

Both are, of course, better the further from the centre, but I really think Liverpool incorporates it better and it really has a nice effect on me (a large stretch of road that leads towards town near me is lined with grass and flowers and trees and it really is nice), however I find that rivers are more incorporated into Londons design so it isn't *too* far off, though it's harder to utilise this in the cheaper areas further from the rivers

London also generally struggles to use parks in the cheaper parts of the city, whereas I live in walking distance from ~5 parks, one of them being [pretty damn huge](http://liverpool.gov.uk/leisure-parks-and-events/parks-and-greenspaces/croxteth-country-park/) and there are also more random patches of grass between homes

London parks also seem to be more focused on flat patches of grass rather than nice areas with trees and animals and such where you can be more alone with nature, which is very nice, though I do get that this would be rather difficult to implement in London

That's precisely why these kind of subsidies are very hard to get rid off, for most people it's just a tiny increase in the cost of living, but for many farmers it can mean hundreds of thousands of pounds.

The link between the NHS and the EU is very weak in people's mind, it's largely seen as a domestic political issue.

Stand Up &amp; Be Counted is a campaign launched to encourage the global fan base of the 72 Football League clubs to register the club they support along with their country and city of residence via www.representyourclub.com. 


In return, fans gain the opportunity to be entered into a competition to win a trip for two to the United Kingdom, including flights, accommodation and match tickets to see their team play. More than 50,000 fans have already entered across 246 countries around the world, placing their teams on the map. 

  
The site includes a leader board so fans can see where their club’s global fan base ranks compared to the other 71 Football League clubs. The leaderboard currently shows Notts County at the top both, with a total of 6,154 fans signing up around the world, thanks largely to the unique connection to Juventus and the Italian Magpies. 


The highest team from the Championship is Leeds United with 6,002 fans registering, and the top club from League 1 is Sheffield United with 1,115 fans signing up. 


The site also features an interactive map displaying where in the world fans are from. The top three countries with the most sign-ups are Australia (8,139), the United States (7,203) and Italy (3,553). 


To be in with a chance of winning the prize and to Stand Up &amp; Be Counted for their club fans need to register on www.representyourclub.com before the competition closes on 26th August

First half, we looked like a far more tired version of the team we've been in our previous games. Cook picked the same team for the third time in the week, and they had a weariness to them. 

They undid us by exploring space on the right flank where Stevens was pushing up. All three goals came from that area, and it's something they'll need to work on for future games.

We needed the goal before the break, that gave us hope and kept the fans on the teams side. If we hadn't had that, we'd have been booed off. Needed a goal from nothing to make it 3-2. Just when we started to push for the equaliser, Stevens got stupidly sent off. If that hadn't happened, I honestly believe we would have won. We ended up with Clarke on the left wing in Stevens role, but not having the skill/confidence to cross the ball. 

Had a number of good opportunities, but luck and good keeping kept them out. We deserved the equaliser by the end though, after 20 minutes of pressing. That draw felt like a victory by the end, both teams have it everything they had. 

In all, some lessons learned. Cook needs a plan b to cover the left back if Stevens is attacking. They weren't better than us, they just found out weak spot and exploited it, like finding a glitch in FIFA. Cook needs to shuffle some more to keep players fresh, they just looked tired from the start. That will get better if he rests some against Reading, but it's a long season.

The GLobal War On Terror was an executive decision by the Bush administration. But there were American's who completely rejected this response. They saw 9/11 as a security issue, not some massive strategic threat. They wanted increased security and the military destruction of al Qaeda infastructure in Afghanistan. Others wanted the response to be conducted by the intelligence services - tracking, capturing and killing people.

Good atmosphere, you never know if these special days and visiting players returning things have legs but this one did. Chanting for Bowles and a good atmosphere in general. They even managed to pack the school end nicely. X Block still looked a bit bare. 

Some good performances all round. Special mention to Konchesky who was a workhorse today and looks like he might win out on the LB battle on that evidence. Hall and Onuoha for the most part OK, although Hall chooses some strange headers at times. Perch stung early and was badly beaten by his man but thankfully wasn't punished. However he had some good involvement in build-up play afterwards, including for the first goal. Faurlin had some lovely passes, including a lengthy beauty to Perch for the first, but seemed to flag and lost possession which led to their first. Chery proving to be worth whatever we paid for him. Henry does what he does. Luongo put in a repeat performance - tireless worker, hope he bags his first goal soon. Austin good, done his share of hold-up work, distribution and pulling the trigger. Phillips was ok, looked a bit more switched on than back at Charlton. Not sure I just watched a 10 million quid performance though. On that basis I hope he stays. Polter I really liked when he came on - went tearing into their box with the ball after their second and won that penalty that saved the day. Obviously nerves were buzzing a bit at that point. Also special mention for Doughty - I think he might be the first home-grown player in a while to claim a first team spot. Good pro and seems pretty trustworthy and dependable when the ball heads his way.

Like I have said - goal deluges. At some point we'll have to plug the holes - we're averaging 2 conceded a match, which is a horrific stat.

Edit: The celebration after the first goal was a bit odd - Chery headed off towards the corner flag by himself while Austin and Phillips celebrated behind him. Faurlin had to beckon everyone together.

Not sure what you do about their second. Set piece downfall late in a match once again.

And whose job is it to make them ready? Because they are far from ready. I never said anything about hand holding. I'm talking about preparing your players physically and mentally to play. Our back 4 are a complete mess. They look bamboozled; utterly lost. They are very much to blame for their performance, however, in no way shape or form should they be in a position to perform like this. You can tell by the way we've played in the last 2 matches that our soide is not prepared. That's on the manager and on the coaches. There's a big and very visible difference between having an off day and not being prepared and thus having an off day. Remember too, that in both of our home losses we played the first halves with the wrong formations. Tactical adjustments were made in both matches that helped fix the problems, but in both matches getting the tactics wrong in the first half helped put our side under severe pressure.

I'm not finger pointing here. I'm not looking to assign blame. It's very obvious to me that our side isn't settled, and I'd like to see our manager make his mark and sort this out. We have a decent side, but a losing streak at the beginning of the season can put a decent side under immense pressure. And this side started the season under enough pressure as it is.

I'm a little scared at this game, cautiously optimistic. Everton Played very well against southampton and they have the midfield muscle to try to stop silva. But, hopefully, the Silva focus will free some space for Sterling/Kolarov and Navas/Sagna so they can get in behind. Eventually, I think this pressure will alow Silva to have a little bit more freedom. If Yaya can support the midfield adequately and bomb forward, and, more importantly, Sagna keeps his defensive duties with some kind of line of 3 -Mangala covering the centre left side when attacking, because Kolarov always play high on the pitch- and sometimes can't recover fast enough (which is ok, IMO, he is a very useful attacking threat so Sterling can cut inside to support Silva, decoy defenders, etc.) On a side note, Stones is playing very well, despite how young he is. Still, I think Aguero's mobility will be too much for him.  

Everton will probably make use of Kone+Barkley (I really like Barkley, awesome player) to support Lukaku, this is a very threatening trio, as they showed against Southampton. While it's true that those are the main threats I think they are enough to cause some problems, as much as I'd like to keep another clean sheet, I think Everton will score at least 1, so my prediction is 2-1 or 3-1 to City.

On a side note, I think Roberto Martínez is a good manager, since he is pretty young I think he'll be pretty good in a decade or so.

You remember that?

IDS is that person for welfare. 

He isn't the one pressing for welfare cuts and efficiencies. That's Osborne. And you know why Osborne likes welfare cuts and the welfare cap and everything else? Because it polls better than pretty much everything else out there. Because the public want it. Because after five years of doing it, the Tories said they would find another 12 billion and the electorate in the swing seats said 'sure! That sounds like a good idea!'

Has IDS done a good job? No. He hasn't. Surprisingly enough, welfare reform is exceptionally difficult at the best of times, during a recession and with Osborne hitting him for cuts every year its even harder. But still he's lobbied for things like a higher minimum wage and he has made the greatest attempt at improving our welfare system since Beveridge. Yeah, it hasn't worked, but not because he hasn't tried. He has spent the last ten years of his life trying to learn as much as he can about getting rid of poverty and has suffered a massive amount of abuse for pretty much nothing in return. He is doing it because he is trying to make the system better.

Do people think that by signing this petition and getting IDS fired the Tories are just going to start ignoring the polling on welfare and become fluffy happy Lib Dems? Do people think that an Osborne creature cutting as much as he possibly can is going to be better than the status quo?

This is happening because, like it or not, the party advocating welfare cuts won the election.

IDS is doing the absolute best he can with the worst hand imaginable. He isn't the enemy here. ",null,0,null,1440261677,null,null,false,0,cubwyu9,null,t3_3hz87l,null,null,null,t3_3hz87l,null,null,null,1441406083,null,22,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22,null

Non sarcasm: because of market forces, basically. Some jobs are just going to be shitty because it's low skilled work that anyone with 2 arms, 2 legs and a few braincells could manage. Therefore there will always be more labour available to do the job than there is demand, and by the magic of supply and demand, that means the jobs pay badly despite being shit (whereas you'd expect the opposite - i.e. people to demand high pay to do shit work). On top of that, because generally the company needs to get these things done as cheaply as possible, and as I said, loads of people are willing to do those shitty jobs, the companies employing them have no incentive to make the job any more appealing (i.e. through high wages or extra benefits). And because we live in a society that values profit above well-being there's no social pressure on them either. 

Therefore the only way to make such jobs *less shit* would be to provide the companies with a strong incentive to do so.

However, while we more often than not wear our gowns at hall, it's not required. Clare is also one of the more modern and progressive colleges, being among the first to admit women. It's incredibly green with a lot of excellent policies towards sustainability. Most importantly, the graduate community (the MCR), is among the friendliest and is very active in college. You would not be seen as some old chap at your age here, even though our college caters to both undergraduates and graduates. The age range is quite wide, but everyone is incredibly welcoming and lovely. You're guaranteed a great time. Also, excellent whisky selection at the Clare MCR Bar.

Now, if I had to suggest another college, I'd recommend Pembroke. It's similarly quite old and traditional while still being very progressive. The food is wonderful, the people seem quite kind, and the grounds are gorgeous. Not to mention, it has an amazing location (not on the river, but still very central).

The Traffic Signs &amp; General Directions 2002 for signs and lines, The Design Manual for Roads &amp; Bridges and The Highways Construction Details for the horizontal/vertical design and material makeup of our roads. There's a Manual for Streets especially for residential and commercial zones. There's something to be said for cost implications where everything from kerbs to asphalt; street lighting to traffic signals are all standardised.

I'm currently stationed in the Isle of Man, where things have not followed UK guidance for some time. Things are heading that way more recently but there's a distinct lack of signage and lining compared to the mainland UK. The geometry of the roads here are also more extreme and where the 'de-restricted' road sign in the UK means 60mph limit, in Mann it means whatever speed your vehicle can manage. The island is a beautiful place and the islanders are right to want to keep it that way, but parts of it are starting to look a lot like the UK due to the adoptance of the standards given in the afore mentioned documents.

They are adopting the 'open space' method in the redesign of the promenade at Douglas which I'm glad about myself due to the character it will imbue the area with.

One wrunkle is registration, which was so difficult to get I gave up, and just paid bribes for five years. It's quite hard for a foreigner to actually legitimately own anything in India.

There are many people who do this, as a business, so they'll be able to tell you how to get around all these hurdles. Be warned though, it's more about relationships than procedure, so one person's answer may not work for you I'd you don't know the same official/police officer/registration clerk.

Tied with FotD has to be The Doctor Dances, right at the end where he figures out how to save everyone.

Oh yes, 'EVERYONE LIVES!!!!!'

Second to that has to be any major-plot Eccleston episode.

But we have plenty of reasons to be optimistic. We played well against Man U. For 60 minutes, we played incredibly against Stoke. Today was an incredibly hot day against a reasonable Leicester side that put 11 men behind the ball. It was always going to be a slow day, and we actually did what good teams do: we fought, we kept our heads up, and we scored what should have been the winner late on in the game. That we screwed it up immediately is incredibly frustrating and it's going to hurt us down the line, but it's not like our team is a pile of shit.

&gt; Do you really think that the 99% of people who currently don't earn 250k+, doesn't contain anyone capable of being a CEO in the UK, for the measly pittance of (e.g.) 250k?

It's human nature to want more than you already have. Thats one of the reasons people start businesses, with the hopes that they can build it up to the point they and their family never have to work another day in there lives.

If a 'maximum wage' is imposed, people *will* find ways around it.

&gt;The idea that the super-wealthy are in their privileged positions due to their inherent superiority to the rest of us is laughably foolish

I never said anything implying this...

null,null,ciaran036,null,null,null,"&gt; Let me get this straight. It's only sectarian when Catholics aren't the people celebrating?

How do you even come to that conclusion? 

&gt; You are simply blind to your own one sided stance. Look back over your contribution to this sub. 

Examples where I've exhibited a pro-nationalist stance please? I invite you to scour through my comment history, I doubt you will find many examples of me having a one-sided stance. I almost always give fair criticism to other sides where it is due when it is being discussed. 

I rarely even talk about issues related to nationalism/unionism, so I don't know what you're talking about. 

A recent example is Peggy O'Haras funeral, the only things I even mentioned there were common-sense rebuttals to idiotic suggestions like 'they should have sent armed police in'. In that comment thread, there were accusations of people being 'Republican sympathisers' for just talking common sense about it. 

I also recently got involved in a conversation about the footballer McClean. I made it clear that nobody should ever be forced to wear a poppy or take part in national anthems. That's another moment where I'm sure you probably lumped me in with all the other nationalists/Republicans. 

Previous to that, I've given barely a whisper to nationalist/unionist politics, so I seriously don't know what you're on about. You didn't like my opinion about James McClean and you don't like my opinion about the Orange Order. Neither of those opinions have anything to do with nationalism/unionism. On plenty occasion, I've made it clear what I think about parties like Sinn Fein and Republicanism in general. It simply doesn't interest me much.

You know yourself that there is a huge amount of people from Catholic backgrounds who simply aren't interested in a United Ireland, and I've mentioned that on countless occasions on this sub-reddit, and yet still there are people like you going about accusing people like me of being a nationalist ""bigot"", when that couldn't be further from the truth. 

I think perhaps part of your problem is that some of my opinions fall into general lefty Socialist thinking (most of the time) and you maybe associate that with nationalism/Republicanism. I'm also totally non-religious, and that would help explain why I'm not the Orange Order's biggest fan. I'd hardly be a fan of the Ancient Order of the Hibernians as well, but sure are they even a thing any more? 
Looking at my older submission history, I'd actually forgive you for seeing me as a nationalist as I did submit a few posts critical of the loyalist flag protesters in years past, but there's still plenty criticism of actions by hardcore Republicans and dissidents. And there's been nothing like that recently anyway.

I think he possibly needs to be bit more politically correct with his wording, instead of referring to it as Islam/Muslims, isolating the problem groups in Islam and use their terms specifically, even make jokes about them to highlight the stupidity. I realise he did actually mean this based on his whole talk, but it was getting little annoying to hear him refer to Muslims all the time instead of the key focal group which is damaging to the fight against it and what he supposedly represents. 

I also found it difficult to understand the one sided approach by the police, if this is in fact true, something seriously needs to be done there to. It's like the police/establishment are blindly ignoring a lot of the problem, but there may be a purposes with a more paranoid slant on it. Like the saying goes, ""Divide and Conquer"".

Traore was the right player to bring on, but it should have been a straight swap for Agbonlahor, who put in a 0/10 performance today. Utterly dire.

The final quarter of the game was Palace pushing forward through our midfield against a tired side who no longer possessed their midfield general. So frustrating after being reasonably solid for most of the match.

I know there's a widespread desire for stability across this sub, and I'm not arguing for his sacking either, but the honeymoon period should be well and truly over by now. I like the man and I still think he's got his fundamentals essentially right - he stands by his possession-based style, seems to encourage players to express themselves on the pitch and has consistently tried to bring youth through - but that's not enough if he's unable to translate his ideas on to the pitch, and he's had a full season to do it by now.

We lack collective creativity in the offensive phase, we're unable to build-up play and, above all, we look disorganized, much more than we ever did under AVB. People will keep blaming the players, but it's the manager's groundwork that should allow the individual talent to shine through. This is particularly flagrant in the defensive phase, if you think about how many centre-back pairings we've been through in the last year, without stopping leaking goals left and right. Far less talented players than Jan and Toby have shined in well-drilled defences, because when a defence functions as a unit it's easier for the players to interpret the game and  know the exact distances needed between them, their colleagues and the opponent according to the context in which he has the ball (is he facing the goal? under pressure? in the central corridor or on the flanks?). It's not just the defenders either, during the defensive phase our sectors are far too distant from each other, we don't look compact.

This has been a problem for a long time, particularly worrying during Sherwood's tenure. I'd suggest you go and rewatch our first game against Benfica during our EL run a couple of seasons ago - it's the perfect illustration of a lesser side working as a perfect unit and being lifted by a great manager who knows how to implement his ideas. I thought Poch would be a step in the right direction to sort this issue, but I'm beginning to grow disappointed.

Defendant, a first time offender in her 30's, asked to be sent to prison as she was struggling with heroin addiction. Magistrates basically said it isn't police and prion systems job to offer rehabilitation (rightfully so) but then the total costs equated to around £500 (£150 court charge), nearly £200 more than the stolen goods value, and without any probation order etc to help with addiction.

You know how it goes; the Mickey, the Rory, the Danny, the backbencher who seems to be invisible when their SO is with the Doctor. They'd have a perfectly valid reason to dislike the Doctor. But what if that dislike was picked upon by, say, a greater evil?

Let's just assume for a second that the Master/missy will be the one pulling the strings. She appears at his house at the end of a very early episode, and tells this person that the Doctor is evil, and takes said companion back/forward in time to show some sort of devastation the Doctor has performed. It could be the genocide of Gallifrey, or it could be something different...

But it works. 

The Master now has a pawn, a puppet who is on his/her side, that can try and make unexpected attempts on the Doctor's life when nobody else is around to see it. The Doctor will narrowly survive/miss the attack but remains oblivious until the very last few episodes where he begins to get suspicious, but says nothing to the primary companion, not until he is fully sure anyway.

1) No you have right of way. For everything, minor roads yields to major roads. However you should keep your wits about you as you never know what people are going to do.

2) In general, stay left if you can. Look at the road markings for lane indication. In your example, the left lane would have a left pointing arrow drawn in it, the right would have a right arrow etc. Not all junctions are the same though.

3) You do not need to periodically pull over for traffic. If you feel uncomfortable fair enough, but you don't have to legally.

General advice would be wear a helmet and lights and/or visible clothing and always look over your shoulder if you are moving right. They're called life savers for a reason!

Take your lane. You don't need to be aggressive, but don't ride in the gutter either.

Nothing is wrong with wanting (a bit) more than you have currently - it's one of the things that drives humans, but it's not the only thing. As social animals, we also want to care for other people - which includes much larger groups than our direct kin, e.g. larger society, and in many cases, the human race as a whole.

But... the preposterous notion that people should be able to exploit the labour of others to the extent that ""They and their family never have to work another day in there(sic) lives."" is staggeringly sociopathic! Why the fuck shouldn't they have to work? Everyone else has to! No individual has an intrinsic 'worth' that is so much greater than any other, that they should be able to live off the backs of other people's work. How would you even think that?

The people who amass vast billions of wealth DID NOT earn it! They may have set up a company with some hard work, a bit of talent, and almost certainly a lot of luck and pre-existing advantages, but they didn't personally do all of the work that running and building up that business required - they hired other people to do it.

As soon as you are more than a one-person self-employed business, you are depending on the work of others for your profits. If you earn billions, whilst your thousands of low paid workers can barely afford to feed their kids, then you're not a 'successful entrepreneur', or a 'pillar of society' - you're a morally bankrupt parasite.

""I never said anything insinuating this..."" - I didn't say you did, it was part of my point that CEOs are not (in almost every case) in their jobs because of the obvious recognition of their blinding talent - it's because of which university they went to, who they hob-nobbed with in the city, or who their parents were, etc etc.

If the 7 figure CEOs do leave - they will be replaced by people who will do just as good a job, for the new, lower, wages being offered. If you don't think that this is the case, because the current crop of CEOs represents the creme de la creme of all possible talent in the UK, then I think you're sadly deluded - which is ok, because the rich will continue to screw you (and the rest of us) over, but at least you won't be upset about it.

Capitalism as a pure form of market competition, doesn't mean 'pulling up the ladder' - that is anti-competitive behaviour, that distorts the ability of the 'free market' to allow for the entrance of new players with potentially new and better ideas!

null,null,prof_hobart,null,null,null,"&gt;If there was no immigration and if those areas were not often experiencing decades of economic stagnation, would they still be concerned about immigration?

If there was no immigration anywhere in the country, probably not. There has to be a grain of truth in the lies that are created - like with terrorism, without the occasional attack it would be impossible to create hysteria around threat.

The economic stagnation point is a very good one - the reason why certain people are so keen to push the ""immigrants are taking your job"" line is that it's a great smokescreen around the real reason that jobs are disappearing from some places - chronic underinvestment, offshoring, exploitative companies getting people to work long hours rather than employ more people etc.

&gt;As I said, mis-spending is as much of a concern as over-spending. I didn't say we were wrong to attack PFI, I was simply pointing out that the idea of Labour misusing taxpayers money was not confined to Tories or to post-crash analysis of Labour's record in government. 

I'm not going to disagree with any of that. The centre-right economic policies of New Labour were not vastly better than the Tories. But they were better, and that's what Labour has been embarrassed to say.

&gt;You can't at one and the same time claim that people are wrong to trust the Tories' spending commitments and go off on one about how bad Labour were at spending taxpayers' money.

I can when the alternative that was being sold (and bought by the electorate) was one that took the worst aspects of New Labour economics and built on them. 

&gt;I said austerity was not the major reason, which is what the study confirms.

It wasn't the only reason, but then austerity is far from the only difference between the right and left.

&gt;If SNP-voters distrust of Labour's economic credibility was a major reason for their desire for independence, all that show is that restoring our economic credibility is the key to winning all voters

By the look of the polls, the Scots were even less convinced by the economic credibility of the Tories. Is it coincidence that these were the only ones who were sold a message that there was an alternative to austerity?

&gt;Well, according to Cruddas, we reassure people that we won't spend so much and/or spend it badly.

I agree with the second part - don't spend it badly - but not the first. Not spending so much money is the austerity plan that's failed everywhere it's been implemented. But it's the one that the Tories have pushed and Labour has been to scared of coming across as profligate to argue against. That created a public perception that austerity was the correct answer, but many didn't believe Labour could deliver it.

That's vastly different from arguing, as Corbyn does, that austerity *isn't* the answer, here's why, and here's how we're going to something different.

Again, it's the same with immigration. Rather than arguing that immigration is, on the whole, nowhere near as much of a problem as the Daily Mail makes out, Labour accepted it was a big problem and then failed to look as strong as the Tories at tackling the problem.

The way to sell a different vision isn't to accept your opponent's view of what the answers look like and then make a half-arsed and unconvincing attempt at delivering those answers.

Because ideology.  Marxist leftists view the world as a manichean struggle between socialism and capitalism.  Islamists are also against the West, and so get a free pass.  And the IRA despise the British, and so they get a pass.  Oh, and of course Communism also gets a pass, even though it's perhaps the most lethal ideology which has ever existed.

&gt;The inference you seem to be pushing at is with naivety or he has malign intentions.

Trying to decode your mangled grammar - I don't think that Corbyn is some evil genius.  I think he's probably quite a nice guy.  But he is an ideologue - and that makes him troublesome.  It's certainly worrying that a potential prime-minister is unable to properly distance himself from antisemitism and holocaust denialists.

&gt;Either of which is wrong, and doesn't preclude him from high office.

Spurs are like a guy/girl who constantly finds themselves as a rebound partner. They are good looking, witty, smart, and well enough put together to seem like a good bet at the time. Hell they may even be able to keep some of these relationships together for months to a year or two. However, inevitably, the rebound person is let go once their SO (who is probably above their level to begin with) is over the rebound and picks someone smarter, wealthier, or just in general better. this sums up spurs, the team is just good enough that they can dream of glories that should be out of their reach and come tantalizingly close to getting them (or even getting them as that one glorious champions league year was). however the team almost always falls after 7 months of competing because they just can't keep up with the other better suitors for the glory.

I root for spurs because it's never fun to root for the best, but it is exceedingly fun to root for those who have a chance against the best and seem like they only need one or two things to break right for them to be up there. when those things break right (Bale, VdV, Liverpool falling off) it is all that much better for the team and us as a fan base because the team reached the potential we all knew it had, just like the rebound person finally getting a rebound relationship to stick.

Sure, 6-1 is unacceptable, but giving the circumstances it wasn't really as dissapointing as it should've been. Also, I don't really see what Klopp would do to make everything so much better. Klopp got time at Dortmund, and where at the bottom of the league for half a season last season. He also did well. BR almost won us the league and then he gets the same league spot as we have had the previous 3 seasons before he arrived.

Remember that FSG wants a policy where they wanted young players or they didn't want to pay the full price, leaving Rodgers to choose between players that weren't on the top of his list. This year he has gotten everyone he wanted. Ayre said so himself. We should expect him to do well now, and if he doesn't he might not have what it takes. I'm just saying that Steven Gerrard said that Rodgers was the best manager he's ever had and that it was a pity he didn't come in earlier.

People say Suarez got us 2nd place in 13/14, but who got the most out of him? Look how much better Suarez was under Rodgers than what he was under Dalglish.

In your scenario, use the correct lane for the direction you wish to travel. If it is a complex junction as you described, there may be an alternative protected cycle route, though. 

3. Only pull over for emergency vehicles with the blues and twos going. Anything else - continue on your journey.

Still, maybe we'll get another 12  months of great performances out of them before this happens again. 

This was always going to happen under new management. I mean not the thumping by Bournemouth, but the uncertain play and somewhat lack of direction. It should have been better, but we still scored 3 goals. 

The thing that really gets me down, is the boos at half time. I was sitting in a bar in Turkey watching the game, hoping for a win before my 1am flight back (wishful thinking) and I was embarrassed at the boos. Embarrassed. Maybe the fans that were there in person saw something I didn't, a lack of commitment, passion, I don't know. But that is not West Ham. And that really winds me up.

a) We start to address gross wealth inequality in society, b) start to turn society away from the wasteful pursuit of profit for its own sake, and c) will have businesses that don't waste vast sums on parasitic executive pay, which can be reinvested in better paid (i.e. more loyal and productive) workers, and / or R&amp;D, better customer service, etc. etc. - thus making these companies MORE competitive *without* the 7-figure CEOs, than with them.",null,0,null,1440267823,null,null,false,0,cuc0a2p,null,t3_3hye47,null,null,null,t1_cubzv88,null,null,null,1441407644,null,1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt;
&gt;___Rose Tyler: Earth Defence___ was the title given to a proposed, but ultimately aborted *Doctor Who* spin-off set some time after Rose's final parting from the Tenth Doctor at the conclusion of *Doomsday*.
&gt;Based on dialogue in that final story, the series most likely was intended to feature Rose's life on the alternate Earth the Doctor had dubbed ""Pete's World"", working with that reality's version of the Torchwood Institute.
&gt;The series had been commissioned by BBC One but abruptly cancelled by Russell T Davies, who decided that it would have lessened the impact of *Doomsday*. The spin-off was cancelled before Billie Piper had been formally approached. Reportedly the original plan was to produce a one-off special (likely for broadcast around a holiday, possibly Easter), followed by more specials if demand warranted, in lieu of a weekly series.

Flaky/ or itchy scalp can be a number of issues - seborrhoeic dermatitis, atopic eczema, mild psoriasis, allergic or irritant contact dermatitis and so on. What improves one can easily worsen another so random self treatment of a self diagnosis is unwise.

Most commercial 'dandruff' shampoos are formulated for mild to moderate seborrhoeic dermatitis but are much too harsh for atopic eczema, allergic or irritant contact dermatitis. SD is a chronic condition anyway, so it invariably does flare up when treatment is ceased. Most pharmacy treatments advise scaling back frequency of use once the flaking and itching is under control but not stopping.

Frankly I have been underwhelmed by most hairdressers knowledge of dermatology and formulation, I would not rely on them at all. They are qualified in styling and certain chemical treatments to level 3, they are not doctors, pharmacists or cosmetic scientists all of which are qualified to level 5+.

Lamela wasn't as bad as made out, the circlejerk has extended to articles now. 

Ironically, his point about pace is exactly what I said in my last couple of posts just now; Lamela finds himself in situations where nobody is making a run, nobody has pace and is stretching the defence. What more can he do against a team with 11 men behind the ball and NOBODY is making moves? He's *not* a 'toe punt past a defender, smash one in from 20 yards' type of guy. He's a AMC, shifted out to RW at Roma because of Totti, but I think his natural position is in the centre. 13 of his 15 goals at Roma came from inside the box. Good to see we're wasting such a talent though.

Radical Islam is global in a way Fascism never has been, Fascisms though they do have differences, generally tend to elevate the Nation-State over and above anything else. The People - highly racialised - take precedence over class and religion both. Radical Islam, and Islam more generally, has a conception of community which goes *beyond* the Nation, or particular Racial groups, towards a more global notion orientated around a particular interpretation of a holy book. Radical Islam has equally not arose out of crises of Liberal Democracy and Capitalism in the same way. I don't recall people being sympathetic to Radical Islam because it can provide a bulwark against this darn communists as the attitude was originally before the war. There are significant historical and ideological differences between the two. They don't all have to be ""fascist"" to be horrible, to be unpalatable. But you frame the clash with radical islam in false terms. It's unhelpful, we don't actually then end up understanding how such groups arise, how they think, and how to be rid of them if we falsely categorise them. This inflated notion of fascism is dangerous, we lose sight of what fascism really is, and fascism slowly becomes a catch-all term for authoritarians of all stripes.

Anyway, if we look at radical islam, violent wahabbists have existed long before Fascism. Fascism is a particularly strange word to use for such people, especially before fascism even arose.

&gt;Within 2 decades it's predicted up to 50% of jobs will be automated

Assuming that stat is accurate (there is no way of knowing that), 50% of current jobs. This does not mean 50% of people will be unemployed.

&gt; Before this transition happened over many decades and was gradual, whereas now the exponential advancement in technology is resulting in large-scale worker-displacement in both low and high-end jobs with a phenomenonally larger population.

Do you have any idea how disruptive the First and Second Industrial Revolutions were? And the first onset of information technology in the 1990s?

&gt;Within the next decade we will be seeing the first instances as automated restaurants, automated cars and automated call-centres begin to appear. 

Have coffee vending machines reduced the demand for cafes? No - in fact the barista market is infamously stronger than ever, as rich people (i.e. everyone in the West) pay ridiculous amounts of money for hairy strangers to draw Pikachus on their flat whites. The amount of stupid things people are prepared to pay other people to do for them is theoretically limitless, and this isn't even considering things which are actually useful.

This idea that automation = permanent loss of jobs is not borne out by history or the present day, and relies on a misunderstanding of how the makret for labour functions. Please unsubscribe from /r/futurology or /r/automate if you haven't already.

&gt;Please, for your own life and your future well being, do not EVER approach an airplane crash from downwind without a proper respirator.
The composite materials that make up a great bit of a lot of airframes are very dangerous. The epoxy binder is very bad on its own when it burns, but the fibrous material of the composite itself can easily be wafted up into the air by the heat &amp; carried along with the smoke.
These fibers can end up in your lungs. Imagine thousands of tiny bits of glass/carbon fibers becoming permanently stuck in the inner linings of your lungs. This leads to inflammation of the lung tissues, causing you to slowly suffocate. In instances when it is not fatal, it leads to permanent scarring of the lung walls and BAM you were a nice healthy 19 year old, now you are a 19 year old with chronic pulmonary fibrosis and possible lung cancer.
The video is not worth it.. Don't get too close, please.
You can refer to this paper[1] from the FAA
Here is a little exceprt from Mayo Clinic about Pulmonary fibrosis: Pulmonary fibrosis occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it more difficult for your lungs to work properly. As pulmonary fibrosis worsens, you become progressively more short of breath.
Imgine knowing that the next breath you take, no matter how hard you try, will always be a little shorter than the one you just took. fucking scary man.

null,null,E_mE,eu,"Berlin, DE",null,"I'd like to reference this definition of fascism here:

&gt; The term Fascism was first used of the totalitarian right-wing nationalist regime of Mussolini in Italy (1922–43); the regimes of the Nazis in Germany and Franco in Spain were also Fascist. Fascism tends to include a belief in the supremacy of one national or ethnic group, a contempt for democracy, an insistence on obedience to a powerful leader, and a strong demagogic approach.

Now the radicals don't conform to the national or ethnic concept here, but it's certainly a religious one, which in the grand scheme of things are pretty much the same idea. To assume you are superior based on a arbitrary information or so called truth based on a book is pretty similar to what nationalist do, attempting to take pride and credit in something which they had no involvement in creating in the first place.

I think the narrative of the EDL is pathetic, the language used ""English Defence League"" really sums up it's stupidity. Also the blind adherence to the military is also pathetic too. But the problems that Tommy Robinson highlights through his experiences in Luton are of  concern and I can see why his so angry about it. The fact that these Radicals want to travel all over the country (Even parts of the world) spreading this idea is also the same practices as the NSDAP did.  

I think the UAF ignoring the problems these people are creating based on narrative or public opinion is actually helping them, it's like proxy assault against the Radicals opponents. I for one don't side with the EDL or any far-right arseholes, but the Radical Islam situation is certainly an issue that has to be dealt with the same way we deal with Nazis. Their needs to be direct action against them since the police and establishment isn't really do.

Banks reach out to them to find out what you've been doing in other parts of the financial world. How would NatWest know if you defaulted with Santander? They check the credit rating agencies. You can get your report for £2 from them, or pay monthly and get a more comprehensive report.

The bank may score internally differently, but they use the credit rating agency score as a part of that. Each bank reports to one or more of these agencies.

So, if you apply for credit (a bank account) on 21st July, the credit rating agency may drop your score seeing you need credit. Then, the next bank, might run a check on the 28th of July (as per your question), and see that your score has dropped recently as a result of you opening a new credit account - which was in the last 3 months for example. This is a sign that you need credit urgently, so they may reject you on any of these basis.

This is just a very crude example of course, not saying this is exactly how it works, but banks do tend to work along these lines.

Having said that, I applied for a mortgage in July, credit check went through on July 27th, and just yesterday I applied for a credit card and got accepted instantly.

There's 101 different ways the footage could be used to help people in the future.. Even just as an example of how people react when presented with a disaster. Did people call the police? How many people just started recording? Did people try and move bodies? Did people inhale all that dangerous smoke coming from the plane? Etc, etc. All of that could be used to improve disaster response. 

No one complains when reporters film disasters, but as soon as it's an amateur with a camera phone does it everyone loses their collective shit and suddenly it's 'Oh, why aren't you helping?'

What, I'm not trusted to be an amateur journalist but it's fine for me to be an amateur fireman and an amateur paramedic? Where's the logic there?

At the start of the summer we were an improving team, just finished 7th in the league, in europe and with, what looked like, an excellent infrastructure for continued success.

We didn't buy any good players, the team was weakened massively and now players can see that. 

We should have thrown money around in June, it should have been all sewn up. 4/5 big players, 50 million spent. Players like Shaqiri, Toby, Payet, Austin and Nzonzi. 

Everyone and their dog knew Schneiderlin was leaving for circa. £25 mil. Clyne was also 95% gone for around half that. 

So hear we are, on the verge of going out of europe after being battered 3-0 at home in the second game of the season with a squad that isn't nearly as good as the team that started last year. 

Although Wanyama is good, I do not rate him too highly. Can we replace him? No, because we fucked up the transfer window. 

I have never been more fucked off as a Southampton fan than I am now.

Oh no they can't. Many of them are utterly fucked and they know it too. There is a war thread between 118 property tribes and HPC.

The problem is many of them have ALREADY spent their gains. A popular model on propertytribes where everybody worships Fergus Wilson. Was (note past tense) to take out an interest only mortgage. Then wait for property prices to rise using the gains in the property and reducing in LTV they borrow more money to buy another property. Rinse and repeat.

Therefore they can't sell because this will realise their CGT liabilities. Which they have already spent.

They also can't just keep it either as even with zero cash flow and zero 'profit' on rents they still have to pay tax. There was a £600K calculation somewhere where even though there were no paper profits there was tax payable on 100K 20K or 45K depending on the tax rate they paid. They can't raise rents to cover the additional tax due to the law of rent. If people are already putting in 60%+ of their take home pay as rent they can't afford more.

The only way out is to form a ltd company and or go overseas. Or go bankrupt.


Lastly you have to remember there are 4+ million BTL properties highly leveraged. If 4 million homes go on the market what happens? Prices collapse which means EVEN if they sell they still owe what was taken out in the loans. Which means bankruptcy.

Fergus Wilson knows this. He has 900 properties in one area. He knows he can't sell them in one go as this will cause a massive supply overflow and crush prices. Yet he knows he can't keep them. 

Therefore what is happening is BTLers are backstabbing each other and they are quietly selling but saying they are keeping hold to avoid being one of the rush sellers.",null,0,null,1440275343,null,null,1440275524,0,cuc46wh,null,t3_3i04gp,null,null,null,t1_cuc3p8h,null,null,null,1441409553,null,25,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25,null

If you're close enough that whatever you're filming is *so* unique, you're close enough to help. Find casualties, help the wounded -even if that's just holding someone's hand and talking to them while you wait for the paramedics. Hearing's the last thing to go, after all. I've sat with enough dead people to know that if my nearest and dearest were caught up in it, I'd like to think that they weren't left alone while scared and in pain, even if they weren't critically injured.

&gt;All of that could be used to improve disaster response.

But it won't be. This is a well understood type of major incident. Lessons will be learnt about the response, but that'll be through the emergency services' own protocols, not on the basis of a youtube video.

&gt;No one complains when reporters film disasters

People do complain. In the UK, most news organisations have a handle on the balance between reporting and intrusiveness. They don't always manage it, but at least they understand the tension.

&gt;What, I'm not trusted to be an amateur journalist but it's fine for me to be an amateur fireman and an amateur paramedic?

There's no comparison. If you're standing there gawping with a cameraphone, you're not an amateur journalist, you're a bystander. Nobody's expecting you to be an amateur anything. Just a decent human being.

Ok, well [here](http://www.afr.com/leadership/careers/jobs/technology-is-set-to-wipe-out-60-per-cent-of-rural-jobs-ceda-20150616-ghp5f4) is an article discussing one area of job displacement. Where will they go?

[Here](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) is an excerpt from Oxford university, suggesting:
&gt;According to our estimates around 47 percent of total
US
employment is in the high risk category. We
refer to these as jobs at risk –
i.e.
jobs we expect could be automated relatively
soon, perhaps over the next decade or two.

Again, you think 47% of employed people within the US can just move into a new job? 

&gt; For  workers  to  win the
race, however, they will have to acquire creative and social
skills.

What about those that can't? If they can't work? 
 
[Here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-santens/future-of-jobs_b_8011296.html) is a great article discussing the change in employment:
&gt; both middle and high-skill jobs are being steeply replaced with low-skill jobs, and have been since the 1970s.

These low-skill jobs are simple, and easily replaceable. So then they will be out of jobs and therefore cannot earn working tax credits, which is not as progressive as you make out.

So will we replace them with other meaningless jobs that can be automated? But then, why would we do that? Because as discussed [here](http://theconversation.com/any-job-isnt-necessarily-a-good-job-for-people-out-of-work-35217):

&gt; Those who moved into optimal jobs showed significant improvement in mental health compared to those who remained unemployed. Those respondents who moved into poor-quality jobs showed a significant worsening in their mental health compared to those who remained unemployed.

So should we put these people into meaningless jobs, as there won't be enough high-skill jobs. UBI allows a transition and movement away from 1. a bloated welfare system and 2. reliance on work for a liveable income. Both need to be addressed in the close future.

Coffee vending machines didn't destroy the labour market, but how about a robot that can put said pikachu on your coffee, and make it cheaper, better and quicker than your barista? Automation *does not mean* permanent loss of jobs, but it takes jobs away from certain markets. And these currently are unprecedented in their coming change.

And basic income both is not a silly idea, for example in a recent study in Nambia: 

&gt; The village school reported higher attendance rates and that the children were better fed and more attentive. Police statistics showed a 36.5% drop in crime since the introduction of the grants. Poverty rates declined from 86% to 68% (97% to 43% when controlled for migration). Unemployment dropped as well, from 60% to 45%, and there was a 29% increase in average earned income, excluding the basic income grant. These results indicate that basic income grants can not only alleviate poverty in purely economic terms, but may also jolt the poor out of the poverty cycle, helping them find work, start their own businesses, and attend school.

UBI increases creative business and entrepeneurship, which are both needed with the coming displacements. Working tax credits do not. This is also being reflected in India and other areas where a UBI is trialled. 

[HERE](http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/06/15/growths-secret-weapon-the-poor-and-the-middle-class/) is also an article from the IMF discussing how a change in 1% of income share to the poorest can increase GDP growth vastly compared to a negative impact of the richest. UBI is a distributive policy and will therefore improve the economy. Working tax credits does not do that to nearly the same degree.

&gt;Specifically, we find that making the rich richer by one percentage point lowers GDP growth in a country over the next five years by 0.08 percentage points—whereas making the poor and the middle class one percentage point richer can raise GDP growth by as much as 0.38 percentage points (Chart 2).  Put simply, boosting the incomes of the poor and the middle class can help raise growth prospects for all.

So yeah, not such a bad idea. I'll continue subscribing to /r/automate thanks!

Edit: UBI is also one of the few things supported *by members on all sides* of the political spectrum, which is an enigma in itself.",null,0,null,1440276144,null,null,1440276938,0,cuc4lnu,null,t3_3hz81k,null,null,null,t1_cuc1q2e,null,null,null,1441409746,null,3,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,3,null

As I said go look at propertytribes and 118 property. Many of them are stamping their feet and attempting to get a petition to Osborne to reverse it and calling it unfair. About how they were providing a service and were a huge part of the economy (rent seeking is not really making money merely diverting it to yourself) The petition has &lt;1500 names on it though.

Some of them are right bastards too. There was a LL who was a right cunt, he sent S21 notices to ALL his tenants and said if you don't want to be evicted vote for XYZ.


&gt; I wonder why all of these BTL LLs don't structure their operation in an LLC. Is because a lenders wouldn't lend to a LLC and want the security of the LL's personal liability? If that is the case, which I suspect it is, then there is no way LLs are re-structuring into LLCs. 


Bingo! Ltd companies can be closed down to dodge liabilities. There are also many LLs who keep it hush. Forming a LTD company is pretty much telling HMRC you're renting out property commercially. Ltd companies also come with fat fees.

 There are viable means to do it though if you structure it correctly. Been out of accounting in this area for a while so the details aren't clear to me.

&gt;AFAIK most BTL lending companies are chasing people with few properties not in an LLC as that is the safest market.

Exactly, we haven't been a consistently good team since Bale left. It hurts to say it, but it's true. AVB struggled after Bale as did Sherwood and as has Pochettino. At this point I think it's pretty obvious that it's not the manager.

That being said I think we're moving in the right direction, but we are having to completely overhaul the squad while building a new stadium. That's going to take some time and consistency is what we need.

We haven't been that bad either. It's obviously disappointing to be two from nine, but our loss was at United to a team that has spend ungodly amounts of money over the past two years. We played great against Stoke barring 11 minutes at the end. Even with Leicester I think a draw isn't a terrible result. Look at their form going all the way back into last season.

You should go and look up the causes of civilian deaths in the troubles then.

&gt;The IRA took greater pains than most armies ever have.

Not true. They avoided killing Catholics who they viewed as the same as them. They didn't give a fuck about anyone else. Most people avoid actively murdering their own people but unlike the IRA they don't make distinctions like that.

&gt; They chose guerilla tactics out of necessity.

Again I disagree. They chose the tactics that would get the most amount of attention and strike fear into those who opposed them in order to get them to cede to their political demands out of fear. You know, terrorism.

&gt;Whether some few went beyond the bounds of reasonable in their efforts is a mark against those individuals, rather than the IRA as a whole.

Funny that you don't apply the same logic to the British Army, even those who fought a war you can't possibly like wasn't legitimate like WW2.

Just changed case so now I have a great quality Air 540 knocking around, I'll provide 4 fans with it. 

It's a great case and there is a reason it's so popular because it's got a beautiful huge side window and cable management with it is an absolute dream. Selling it for a very reasonable  £60 but collection only as I couldn't possibly post this beast without it costing too much, I live in North London so PM me if you're interested in coming and getting it.

At work currently but I will post a pic and timestamp in about an hour.

null,null,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,null,"&gt; Yeah, the government totally took huge cuts to the police force to pay for the EU. And if we get back that however much we pay for membership, that'll clearly go directly into public service.

That's what always strikes me as strange from the Eurosceptic right. On one day they'll argue that something like the EU, or foreign aid costs too much money, and that money could be spent on public services in Britain. On another day, they'll argue that too much is being spent on public services in Britain, and we need to have cuts. 

Which one?

&gt; Wasn't it found the energy companies were ripping everyone off anyway? They're doing that independent of the EU.

And this is another one that baffles me. Many of the same faults they'll find in the EU, like lobbying or lack of democracy, are just as endemic in Britain. If they criticised these things in Britain as well, it would be fair enough, but it seems they're only using it as a stick to beat the EU with rather than trying to make a principled argument.

null,null,King_of_Avalon,eu,London,null,"&gt; I don't disagree with a lot of the CAP complaints, but I think this overestimates how much the average Brit cares about paying a few pence more for sugar.

Not only that, but with the price of most commodities at around six-year lows, the difference in EU agricultural subsidies is almost trivial at this point. I would also note that the EU sugar market is planned to be opened and liberalised in 2017, so beyond that date, sugar prices should continue to fall as international imports come in. It's a slight shame we haven't got that now, since global sugar prices are remarkably low, but EU sugar prices are currently a bit high due to the hot, dry weather we've had across most of Europe this summer.

I agree that I can't even see why they're focussing on police. It's such a tenuous link to suggest that national spending on local constabularies is in any way related to the EU budget. They might as well say that we should leave the EU and that will affect how many times your local park has new benches installed, because that's maintained by the local council, whose budgets are set by DCLG, who in turn has funds allocated from the central government, and that *might* be slightly higher if the UK left the EU.

Or alternatively, the central government could just decide to allocate more funds to local constabularies instead of many, many other things it spends money on. Perhaps closing that non-dom tax loophole would be a good place to start? This idea that one single source of payments (the EU) is single-handedly responsible for cuts in funding to **every other thing** the government spends money on is frankly a weak argument.

They *might* be happy with a compromise by the landlord, but then again the landlord could refuse them a tenancy. It's not worth it.

Because we as a nation have a unique group of shared values and history, because your community is made up of people who have managed to form a society with. I just find it odd you feel more at home with people who do not share your language, culture, history or values than you do with people who are much more likely to.

My concern is that we have no had a debate was whether we should be part of a single European nation and you consider it to already have happened and a default position which the rest of the UK must work to change.

&gt;We have practical problems that need to be solved; some of which are best tackled at a continental or national level.

I'm not sure which problems are best tackled by excluding the rest of the world, you seem to forget we have influence that spans across the globe and by staying in the EU we are losing that influence.

I think back to the leaders or players who demanded the ball, the likes of Van Der Vaart, Davids, Keane, Bale, Berbatov, King, etc.

We are just lacking that experience to help guide the team and calm the younger players when we are in the ascendancy so we can see games out.

The other thing which has worked against Poch is our transfer policy he never got his first choice signings last year (Schneiderlin and the Villarreal centre back). We have been left alarmingly short of pace when you consider the wingers we have had in recent years.

That's the whole point of people being in work in the first place, not so a company can do its business, so we all have the ability to enjoy life. 

A government saying that someone needs $10 an hour to live in society, they aren't trying to close down your business. It's trying to ensure that people, no matter to the skills possessed, circumstance of finance or even the family tree, have a decent quality of life. It means the government doesn't have to prop up the low wages and the deficit those people have to afford an existence. It means the government involvement is actually smaller. It means that people claiming benefits fraudulently are easier to find.

null,null,aeisenst,num5,,null,"I still think Poch is the future for the club. Unfortunately, just like AVB, he hasn't gotten the support he needs from Levy. Do you think he wants a team with just one starting quality striker? While it's a ton of fun when Levy makes one of his incredible deals, we forget that the reason we're always scraping for players at the end of the window is that he refuses to spend, even when it's necessary. Charlie Austin or Saido Berahino should be on this team by now. We never should be in the position we were in against Stoke, when Kane can't play and we just have no other option there.

Similarly, we should have a better option on the right side. I get that both ownership and probably Poch want to give Lamela more time to prove himself, but Dembele, whether you like him or not, is a lox on that side. The ball gets to him and the play just stops. We have too many slow, technical players in attack, and no pacey attackers that can push back the line. Until Levy invests in players like this, we will keep having attacking problems.

In the end, I think Poch's system can work, but we either need N'Jie to show up big time or we need to bring in another attacker with pace and an accurate pass. You watch our attack, and you see the other team pile guys behind the ball, knowing that all four of our attackers, Chadli, Lamela, Dembele, Kane, will push inside and start dinking the ball around. Since there is nobody running at the line, the defense can just pile up and force a deep shot. The forward press that Poch is so famous for is useless if the other team isn't afraid that if they make a mistake the other team will attack with pace. This game, the press was working. Leicester was losing the ball because of pressure, but once the turnover occurred, the ball went to Dembele, and the defense had all the time in the world to set up. You'll notice that the one goal we scored was because Alli charged the line and the attack moved quickly. Ideally, I'd like to see N'Jie start on the right, keep Chadli on the left, have Eriksen back in the middle, and Kane on top. N'Jie's only job will be to run diagonally at the line and push, push, push. Force them to move the line up to try to keep him offsides.

&gt; With the exception of those for Medicine and Veterinary Medicine (grade C or above in GCSE Double Award Science and Mathematics), there are no GCSE requirements for entry to Cambridge. Applicants have generally achieved high grades in subjects relevant to their chosen course, and most students who apply have at least four or five As or A*s at GCSE. However, there are always exceptions and one of the strengths of the Cambridge admissions system is its ability to assess all applicants individually.

&gt; Our research shows that post-16 examination performance is a much better predictor of degree success at Cambridge. While GCSE results are looked at as a performance indicator, this is within the context of the school/college performance and strong performance in Years 12 and 13 can make up for a less stellar performance at GCSE.

Absolutely zero quality, no movement off the ball, no ambition on it. We perked up in the second half after their first goal (their big Danish forward is pretty terrifying in the flesh, by the way, despite his ridiculous man-bun) but it wasn't quite enough. Hernandez sparked the match into life when he came on, and Hayden did well, but we really shouldn't be conceding two goals that essentially come from the ""aim it towards the big man"" school of thought. 
A couple of thoughts:
-- I was perplexed that Brucey decided to bring Hayden on for Huddleston instead of Meyler. That meant that the onus for creating attacking moves from midfield was soley on Meyler's shoulders (as I see Hayden as more of a defensive player), but that simply isn't a strong part of Meyler's game.

And once you're used to getting things on one day delivery it feels archaic to be waiting all those business days. Also now with a lot of Prime products you can get it delivered to your local post office which is a lot more convenient than having to go to the, in my case anyway, further away depot with ridiculously few opening hours.


Not to mention amazon instant video is actually really quite good and has a lot of shows netflix doesn't so they complement each other, bearing in mind netflix is £72 a year and they don't give you free delivery for anything.

&gt;Again, you think 47% of employed people within the US can just move into a new job? 

Yes. Because it's happened before.

I'm familiar with the Oxford study. It doesn't argue 50% of people are going to lose their jobs forever.

&gt;What about those that can't [get new jobs]? If they can't work? 

This is why it's important for a Labour Government to provide training, because the Conservatives are not very good at it and rely on sanctioning as they don't care about poor people.

&gt;Here is a great article discussing the change in employment. 

Yikes, moving from peer reviewed academic research to HuffPo articles?

&gt;These low-skill jobs are simple, and easily replaceable. So then they will be out of jobs and therefore cannot earn working tax credits,

That doesn't have any bearing on the effectiveness of working tax credits. Or on UBI.

&gt;Coffee vending machines didn't destroy the labour market, but how about a robot that can put said pikachu on your coffee, and make it cheaper, better and quicker than your barista? 

You mean better vending machines? Why would they make baristas obsolete? Don't you think people might pay baristas for reasons other than just acquiring coffees with anime characters on ([for which I would pay through the nose for, incidentally](http://otakumode.com/kokumaijp/suki/kill_la_kill_latte_art).)

&gt;Automation does not mean permanent loss of jobs, but it takes jobs away from certain markets. And these currently are unprecedented in their coming change.

You're contradicting yourself here, and making my point - yes, jobs in certain markets will disappear, just as most blacksmiths, lamplighters, and coal miners have disappeared. *This is a good thing* because the people who would otherwise have done those jobs are now working in jobs in which they are more useful as they produce more and for which *they therefore earn more* than they would as blacksmiths, lamplighters, or coal miners.

&gt;And basic income both is not a silly idea, for example in a recent study in Nambia: 

That's a developmental economics study, and has little relevance to British social policy. Almost certainly ditto the India scheme you mentioned. Likewise studies which show measures to improve education outcomes by giving people tablets to combat intestinal parasites are probably not going to be relevant in the UK.

&gt;HERE is also an article from the IMF discussing how a change in 1% of income share to the poorest can increase GDP growth vastly compared to a negative impact of the richest.

Which is why working tax credits are a great idea and UBI, which gives goodies to groups outside those you refer to, is not.

&gt; UBI is a distributive [sic] policy and will therefore improve the economy Working tax credits does not do that to nearly the same degree.

This is simply wrong. It's regressive in the same way a flat tax would be as it doesn't differentiate between different incomes. Working tax credits are the equivalent to progressive taxation here.

&gt;UBI is also one of the few things supported by members on all sides of the political spectrum, which is an enigma in itself.

Not really. The Right correctly see it as a chance to cut welfare spending, and silly leftwingers see it as a chance to increase welfare spending as they don't understand what good measures to increase the incomes of the poor actually look like (Working Tax Credits are an excellent one).

If I'd found this in the wild and was not involved in the drama, I would had to submit you to /r/badeconomics. The most tiring thing is I've seen all of what you've just said before from similarly ill-informed people.

Some links if you are genuinely interested in understanding this policy area rather than just repeating the memes of badly educated obsessives:

No.  Being over the age of 16 but under the age of 18, the only offence you need to worry about (again, assuming your boyfriend is not in a position of trust over you) is the prohibition of indecent images of children.  Indecent images depicting a person under 18 are illegal; to make, distribute, or possess them is a criminal offence, even if the person making or distributing them is the person depicted therein.

If he were lying about his age and he were younger than 16, then I believe you would be committing an offence of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity (s. 10 Sexual Offences Act 2003).  However, I have had a look at the case law on this and it is not sufficiently clear whether sending sexual written messages to each other constitutes ""sexual activity"" for the purposes of the offence.  The closest I can find is R v Grout 2011, which involved an 18 year old sending explicit messages to a 12 year old.  Though Grout's conviction was quashed on appeal, the court held that the act of sending messages was an ""activity"" and that therefore whether or not it was a ""sexual activity"" was a question for the jury to decide, so I believe that indeed inciting a child to send you sexual messages would mean that you would be committing the offence.

EDIT:  But you would only be committing the offence if you did not reasonably believe that he was over 16.  He's told you that he's 19, that's all the reasonable belief you need, so the offence is not committed regardless.",null,0,null,1440285637,null,null,false,0,cuc9izf,null,t3_3i0mes,null,null,null,t1_cuc985w,null,null,null,1441412114,null,1,null,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,1,null

I don't think that's necessarily true.  FWIW, I have said repeatedly that I don't think he's an antisemite, and I've seen the same opinion expressed in at least some of the articles which contain the allegations.

Of course you can always claim that there's an unspoken implication, but isn't that up to the British people to judge?  We can all have our own opinions on this matter.

So, why is this a big deal if he's not himself a bigot?

Because he has supported and allied with bigots.  Because, most people would want a leader of a major political party to be someone who doesn't pal it up with racists or terrorists.

There's also the issue that he's clearly attracting the support of antisemites - who presumably see him as someone who they can work with.  He alone among all the Labour candidates has become popular with leftist antisemites online.  Not really the sort of people I would want hanging around the Labour party, but I accept that you don't care.

A manager isn't the guy out on the field kicking the ball, but he is the guy responsible for those that are.  Why do you think Fergie was such a great manager with such an incredible length and stability to his success?  Because he knew how to motivate, coach, inspire, organise and drill his teams, no matter who they consisted of.

By your statement above, 'Fergie Time' must be some kind of bizarre good fortune where Utd always just happened to come back and score in the dying minutes of games, again and again, right?  Of course not.  He created a mentality, a ferociousness, that meant his players not only fought to the very end, but somehow had more self-belief at the end than any other team they were playing.

We may have some underwhelming players and some holes in our squad, but Tony fucking Pulis could come in tomorrow and have us playing better defensively by next weekend.  We are a bit of a shambles, both at the back and going forward, and absolving Poch completely is entirely ridiculous.

There may be limits to how much influence a manager can have once the first whistle is blown, but there is a distinct lack of mental strength, organisation and attacking coherency to this side that stretches back to AVB.  Poch's had two full preseasons, three transfer windows and one full season to address things, and we're not really playing any better or with any greater sense of understanding than when he first took over.  If Koeman can take over the cherry-picked remnants of Poch's old side and have them playing better football than us in a matter of weeks, then I don't think we can with a straight face argue that he just needs more time, or more players, or whatever.

There seems to be this bizarrely defensive denial going on at the moment where somehow criticising Poch means you don't really support the club and are calling for his head.  No reasonable person wants to see him fired.  We just want to see better football, and there's really only one person who can turn that ship around.

&gt;There is no hope of any solution to anything when you only listen to one side of the argument.


Did Corbyn also listen to the Ulster Unionists?  Did he sit down with Ian Paisley?  Did he even bother to give equal time to the DUP?  Of course not.  Why?  Because he wasn't interested in listening to both sides of the argument - he was clearly allying himself to one faction.  The faction which supported terrorism against British nationals.

While I'm editing I might as well go the whole hogg.  Fuck the down votes I'm accumulating.  This is a story designed to make you feel a particular way.  He shouldn't have left the home and the bedroom tax shouldn't have been applied in the first place, so it was a administrative mistake/oversight by the company AND council.  But even if it did apply they found a private place with a fully suitable setup, but the owner died and children sold it, so they went into council accommodation which doesn't exactly have a excess of speciality bungalows with adapted showers, so they got the next best, lest they go homeless, a bungalow without a adapted shower until something came up or they adapted something to suit the persons needs, then when something came up/adapted they were moved in.

Sorry, but I think this is just lame.  You're using this as an excuse to avoid dealing with any difficult issues.

&gt;Tony Blair for instance, who embraced Colonel Gaddafi.

Tony Blair was the prime-minister, not a rebellious backbencher acting on his own initiative.  I don't have a particular opinion on him meeting Gaddafi, but I assume he was doing it as part of his official duties, and not because he admired the guy.

&gt;Margaret Thatcher, who was best pals with the awful Pinochet 

I think this actually *is* a good comparison, and I seem to recall leftists getting very irate at Thatcher for her friendship with Pinochet - which did seem to extend beyond her prime-ministerial duties.  I know you don't care, but I think people were right to get upset.

The example was about G.L. because I wanted to have quantifiable examples. And because there are a lot of documentaries available explaining how the City of London is working to accommodate fastest underground trains, or how they are improving the sewer system.

Let me give you another example, this time with money: 

If you had the chance to raise your taxes voluntary, let's say 500£, would you prefer to use that money for:

1) Improve the condition in which illegal immigrants spent their time when they are in a prison in the UK  

2) Use the money to provide proper asylum to all the reporters and journalists from Iraq that are being targeted by the US army because they don't support the new regime. To help Snowden and Assange. ALL IMMIGRANTS    

I'm sure you'll probably pick the second option. 

This is another example of ""put your money where your mouth is""

Not really.  It does mean that his actions had more potential consequences, but we accept that governments have to take difficult decisions - and prime-ministers do have to meet with unpleasant people.  

Look - it's not that difficult.  If the Prime-Minister meets with a horrible head of state then that's one thing - but if you or I met with that head of state and posed together in photographs and made speeches in their honor, then I doubt that we could get away with claiming that we were doing this for diplomatic reasons.

No.  One of the main principles in law is that words have their ordinary English meaning - the [Plain Meaning Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_meaning_rule).  If you want to know what the law considers to be an image then check the dictionary.

&gt;and what about if we talk on the phone?

No different to talking face-to-face.

&gt;Is that also fine? Could it be different as it's technically a recording? Or is it a recording???

It's not a recording unless someone's recording it.  Even if someone was, that person wouldn't be committing an offence - not one under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 anyway.

&gt;Does that mean even if he was lying I'm fine? Since he told me? are you sure about reasonable belief?

I'm 100% sure, it says so [right here in the law](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1/crossheading/child-sex-offences/section/10).  Every single part of the definition has to be completed before the offence is made out.  So a person only commits an offence if they do not reasonably believe the other is over 16.

**Quick 'changelog' kind of thing/explanation of what I did and why:**

**Changed the formatting** - *Keeping everything ruled off and in sections so it's easier to quickly read through, and using bold/italics to make the whole thing more clear and easier on the eye*

**Changed the way the date/time is laid out** - *So people can quickly check the date, time, channel and venue and see it easily, prevents having to scan through text to find important info*

**Added a 'last time out' section with linked access to highlights** - *So you can see at a glance what the score was (plus when and home/away) without having to click through to something*

**Changed highlights link to the official one from www.mcfc.co.uk** - *Simply because the dailymotion version is liable to be taken down at some point*

**Put the 'head-to-head' on the page instead of linking to it** - *Again, so you don't have to click through into a link and search for the information.*

**Crossed out a couple of questions** - *Just because they feel a bit like padding it out tbh, but this is all subjective so feel free to ignore me - that goes for all of my changes really. :D*

**Contributions section for the opposition fans** - *So we know who said what, etc, and can maybe even discuss with them in /r/soccer or whatever.*

**Link to opposing subreddit** - *Again, just for pre/post-match discussion. This could be changed to official club website or something.*

Sorry for this text wall, I just wanted to get everything across in one post rather than having to explain all of the random, miniscule changes I made. Really though, I haven't done much at all, just some minor quality of life changes, it's a great idea (especially getting the opposition involved), so keep it up!

Dembele on the right is growing on me. Mason has been our best CM so far and I'd like to think Alli earned a start by scoring, just like Mason did in the league cup. Until we get someone new I think this is the best lineup we have.

That was one of the reasons why I believe that the salaries of a lot of IBs are justifiable.

&gt; It's completely subjective, unsubtantiable, 

What evidence do you want?

For me, 100 hour weeks and, what, a dozen high profile suicides (plus a higher than average suicide rate) in the field last year show the pressure and difficulties the jobs in this field present.

I never denied that what I said was subjective, anyway, it is down to the individual to classify how hard they think IB analysts work. I personally think they work the most gruelling jobs out of all white collar professions.


&gt; and a big insult to the people who do the myriad other highly demanding (and skilled) jobs for a fraction of the income.

Investment banking analysts don't make very much at all per hour. They get big yearly salaries because they work so many hours. If they do an excellent job, they get bonuses as well but there are very, very few who make the types of bonuses you hear about in the news and it's not analysts making those figures, mainly higher associates and VPs etc., that too in bulge bracket sectors. 

Do you mind listing skilled career fields which are as hard to get into and as demanding as IB? Don't say medicine, even as a med student I'd laugh at reading that.

Read up about it, as I have done. When IS militants first came to the forefront back in 2007ish, it was Sunni militias who took up arms to fight against them, with the promise of them being given roles in the next government, the US/western backed one. After the IS militants were driven away, they were given none of the promised roles, and many leading Sunni politicians and army leaders were removed or arrested by the US/western backed government. We did nothing to stop that whatsoever. 

Why should they trust us or the US? We have

* Invaded them on BS/trumped up charges of WMD 
* Not done anything to give them a role in government afterwards, and stood back and watched as they were not allowed the self-determination of their own country.
* Failed to protect them from IS militants.

  I personally don't see why 'hard to get into' is a valid ethical reason for why someone deserves more resources in life. It might be an inevitable upshot of our economy, but I don't believe that it's a good argument for how things ought to be. The marketability of one's skills, talents, and the opportunities to use them being something of a roulette. I think perhaps we may differ in the extent to which we'd agree on that.  

  When it comes to 'demanding', that is a hugely subjective metric. I can't give you a job that is definitively 'harder', since my point is that that is an insulting statement to present as fact. Any kind of heavy physical job will be demanding and straining on the body, will literally require harder work in calorific terms. Military, law enforcement, emergency response and care work are examples of careers that can be psychologically very taxing.

[Just going off last season](http://www.skysports.com/football/news/30385/9953129/riyad-mahrezs-leicester-success-is-a-victory-for-quality-scouting), he was one of the most creative players in the PL playing with a bang average team with a manager who did not utilize him properly and shackled him with defensive duties. 

With proper tactics that suit him and players (Vardy and Okazaki) that complement him, he is a beast. If you didn't see him today watch his games vs Sunderland and West Ham. Best player on the pitch both times. He has pace, silky technique, ability to use both feet, vision, poise, and now is quite effective with utilizing his vast arsenal at his disposal.

null,null,backtowriting,null,null,null,"&gt;You completely misquoted me, ignoring the bit about IS being the people who are there on the ground, and the US being some distant power propping up a sectarian government.

?  I quoted you verbatim.  I used copy and paste.  If your complaint is that I didn't quote your entire comment - well it's there for everyone to see.  

&gt;Why should they trust us or the US?

I'm not going to rehash the whole Iraqi debate at this time of night.  And whilst I don't have any problem with you or anyone else here criticizing US mistakes, I think that there are problems when a potential leader of a major political party appears to take the stance that there's not much for Iraqis to choose from between ISIS and the West.

Corbyn said: 

&gt;but also some sort of process where [Iraqis and Syrians] can feel a sense of security in their lives rather than being stuck between a war between the rather shadowy leadership of ISIS and the more open and obvious leadership of the USA and the West in propping up the government that’s selling off their oil resources very cheaply – it’s not a happy position to be if you’re a poor person stuck anywhere in Syria or Iraq.

And this is in line with his other remarks, in which he time and time again completely fails to point out the enormous moral difference between the two.  

Sure, if this were just one remark, then I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.  But it's part of a clear pattern.  He just cannot bring himself to unequivocally damn Islamist terrorism, and yet easily and naturally finds every fault there is with Western allies.

BTW - you also have to consider the context of these remarks.  They were said in an interview to a very fringe Australian political group, who have been accused of harboring antisemitism.  And again - this seems to be part of a pattern with Corbyn.  He's more than willing to meet and greet people with very fringe views - people who turn out to have very unpleasant antisemitic views.

&gt;The Rani is assembling a menagerie of sentient life-forms from throughout space and time, hoping to use them to gain control of all individual minds in the universe. She requires only one more specimen, a human from Earth. Knowing that the Doctor will act to stop her, she creates a temporal trap to ensnare the Doctor in all his incarnations.
&gt;The Rani has already captured the First and Second Doctors. The Fourth Doctor attempts to send a warning to his previous and future incarnations of her threat.
&gt;The renegade Time Lord seizes control of the TARDIS. The Seventh Doctor and Ace, en route to China, find themselves instead materialising in Cutty Sark Gardens in 1973. As they walk, Ace is shocked to see the Doctor turn into his sixth incarnation. He explains they must have encountered a ""groove"" in time. They continue their search. Ace finds a clothing stand and they are offered a discount by its owner, angering his wife. The Doctor is shocked to discover that they have moved to 1993.

My point is that referring to Leicester as ""a team that came in 14th"" does not do justice to the quality of that team.  They were unlucky not to come away with results in the first part of last season, and in the last part of the season they got great results.  Because they're actually good.

And yes, I too would certainly hope that we'd get better results than teams below us.  And you know what?  We did.

If we're to judge ourselves by performances, we should:

1. be relatively pleased (though not satisfied) with our performances in the final month of last season and in significant portions of this season so far, and 
2. recognize that the opposition has a say in how well we perform, and Leicester played their game plan well today. 

Also, we lost the lead today because of a mental lapse against a team with the quality to capitalize on it.  But we weren't shit overall.

In your example, when the you (bank) write the mortgage, you create a deposit - which is a debt obligation of yours. The act of 'money creation' just *is* a bank declaring that it owes someone (the borrower) money by creating a deposit in their name. 

Now, of course, nobody (whether human or bank) goes around declaring that they owe others money without something in exchange. In exchange for the bank declaring that it owes the borrower the money for the mortgage, it has the borrower sign a contract obligating him to repay the funds. What that contract represents - a debt obligation of the borrower - is an asset that goes on the books of the bank.
