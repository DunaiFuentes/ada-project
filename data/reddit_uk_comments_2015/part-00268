null,false,Atlascantakeit,null,null,null,"I grew up in a broadly nationalist home (mother English, father Ulsterman) in unionist areas on the north-coast, although I don't really consider myself religiously or culturally identifiable, given that politicians on both these islands are a class unto themselves and i'm religiously agnostic.

I'll admit that I have always viewed the 12th as a noisy inconvenience. I've lived in a few places - Coleraine, Portrush, Derry - where marching band routes have gone right past my home, but honestly I have never felt so put out by their presence that I felt threatened or angry, merely deafened and resolved to a day indoors.

That being said, in the early 2000's I don't remember there being much resistance to the marches, at least not where I was growing up.

In recent years the disputes between the Parades Commission, the police and nationalist communities have seemed to intensify, and this seems to always be in communities where both nationalists and unionists, catholics and protestants are living in relative proximity.

This is where we're seeing problems. When the OO are prevented from marching in an area where many catholics live, they are technically prevented from celebrating their culture in the town/city where they grew up and thus feel legitimately imposed upon. Catholics legitimately feel like they're being subjected to an ostentatious reminder of something they're already more than aware of. The media intensify this by highlighting the minority who behave like bigots; rioting, burning effigies and flags, who incidentally have no historical or political knowledge and are simply using the cultural and religious signifiers that they've been indoctrinated into adopting as a means of venting their anger and frustration.

My perception is that this country was established under division and we're seeing the remnants of our feudal past play out. Political and religious elites stood to benefit from a country divided and the working classes who have consistently had less inclusion in the democratic process, the economy and most other aspirational outlets are acting out, pitting their culture/religion against the other and suffering as a result.

Honestly, i'm bored to tears of all this. 'Your' culture or 'your' religion aren't 'yours' at all. They're circumstantial irrelevances that hold us back from identifying our shared interests. There are real problems in this country; addiction, homelessness, unemployment, and, in my opinion, a stifling, dogmatic religious and political conservatism that creates people who are simply unable to question the supposed value of their cultural identity.

I don't know if I have any particular point to make, or even a recommendation for how we should proceed. I just think we'd all be be better served by pursuing interests that aren't inherently exclusive. If you care about your culture, why not just care about your community instead? If they grew up in the same place as you, went to same kind of school, earn the same kind of money, like the same kind of sport, isn't that worth focusing on? 

There isn't a culture, nation or religion on this green earth so immune from inherent prejudice or 'us vs them' tendencies that i'd march through a fucking town centre for it, that's for sure.

Once upon a time, it was 'if all UK issues were dealt with...' But it's not any more, is it?

&gt;If you've no problem with that then fair enough.

Did Scotland or Wales have a problem with that?

&gt;So you do have a problem with certain members of the UK parliament dealing with the business of the UK parliament? 

No, (again) that's not what I said *or* the point I was making. The issue is with what counts as 'the business of the UK parliament'.

&gt;You want to tear voting rights away from certain MPs

'Tear voting rights away' suggests a loss. Can you describe why it's important for a Scottish MP to vote on something that's a purely English matter?

&gt;One makes Scottish MPs second class, with less rights than other MPs.

No, it gives them rights to vote on UK and Scottish matters. You're asserting that they currently *should* have the right to vote on matters purely to do with England or Wales, for example?

&gt;It's ""Scotland and Wales have too much democracy""

Is it still democracy when you're voting on something that's a separate country that you've devolved from, when the same isn't allowed the other way round?

&gt;You don't want more democracy for England you want less democracy for Scotland and Wales.

I don't see how having the ability as an MP to vote in another country on matters that aren't really anything to do with yours (and not returning the favour) counts as 'more', if you're going to consider redressing that balance as meaning 'less'.

I personally would see it as more democracy for England *and* Scotland.

Some come straight from the trains alternators on diesel services or are not hooked up to the trains batteries on electric services so when the train goes through a neutral section (you'll here the air con go off at these points) the power will go off. When the train goes to a depot, a shore supply will be connected giving steady mains electricity for the cleaners hoovers and other things.

This isn't really a problem for battery operated devices as they will just go over to battery power. Worse case scenario is really you will trip a fuse on an independent circuit, you won't stop the train from working but your plugs fuse might go too. (With most plugs these aren't user changeable like old ones). Basically I view 'Not For Public Use' sockets on trains as the company being able to tell me to get stuffed if my device or charger breaks whilst using this socket, which is fair enough.

The guy was actually on Jeremy Vine's radio show, he bought up the cost of electricity and the fact the train is already using it. It takes around 1kwh to charge an average phone from 0-100%. If I were to buy that from SSE it would cost 9.141p. A diesel train generates more power than it needs so that's basically free. Electric trains current is paid when Network Rail calculate the trains track access charge, so is not a metered connection, so he didn't cost London overground a penny.

I'd recommend asking the Guard could you use these sockets, if you're already using one and they ask you to stop- just stop, don't kick up and cause a fuss it's not worth it. Get one of these if your phone is always running low http://ee.co.uk/ee-and-me/out-and-about/ee-power (free for EE customers, £25 if not. The benefit compared to buying any other one is you can swap a dead one for a recharged one at any EE store.) and avoid over zealous time wasting PCSOs!

- If Conservatives are in power - the NHS is in crisis because of what the Reds did to it.

- If the SNP are in power - GPs probably have had their budget cut to fund a flagship new hospital somewhere that makes a good photocall.

I would assume that, for the most part, most people in the UK don't have particularly bad experiences with their NHS healthcare.

Yes, they did. So they made a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Parliament. Why don't you make an English Parliament if you have a problem?

&gt; 'Tear voting rights away' suggests a loss. Can you describe why it's important for a Scottish MP to vote on something that's a purely English matter?

There is a loss. Its important for members of the United kingdom Parliament to be equal in the sovereign UK parliament because if they are not equal it ceases to be the UK Parliament, it becomes a sovereign English Parliament. 

&gt; Is it still democracy when you're voting on something that's a separate country that you've devolved from, when the same isn't allowed the other way round?

But that's not how it works. Scottish MPs do not vote in the Scottish Parliament! All MPs are equal currently. An MP from Glasgow has as much right to vote on devolved matters as an MP from London. Do you have no idea how devolution works?

All members of the UK parliament should have the right to vote on issues which are the responsibility of the UK Parliament. 

&gt; I don't see how having the ability as an MP to vote in another country

It's not another country, it's members of the UK parliament voting on issues which affect the UK.

**Markovic** - His flair and composure is something I've been dying to see since he arrived and today he's been putting in some great movement as well. It's funny how a creative player looks so much better while playing a creative role instead of a defensive.

**Teixeira** - For a young lad just coming off a broken leg, his vision and movement today is excellent, his pass to Markovic was spot on, he reminds me of another certain little magician.

**Sakho** - This guy has been on and off with injuries since we've signed him. Near the end of last season was no different, however, now that he's back healthy he looks ready to be a tank at the back. Maybe it's the reinforced talent at the back making him fight for a position, idk what it is but I like it. Thumping headed goal as well.

no, because foxes don't have any natural predators. if this guy had actually read the burns enquiry he'd be aware of that. 

there's no great hypocrisy in eating meat, wearing leather and opposing bloodsports really, although I see the point he's trying to make, we should all be more engaged in animal welfare across the board.

not a bad article though, he's right about the class element - like a commenter said, if kids on estates in london all ballied up and went chasing urban foxes with bats and dogs for a jolly on weekends the ruling classes would ban it immediately and without exception. 

the only reason fox hunting survived similar bans on cruel bloodsports is because it's a pastime for the posh, part of the ruling classes 'culture'.",null,0,null,1436882746,null,0,false,0,ct2wo6y,null,t3_3d936o,null,t1_ct2wo6y,null,t3_3d936o,null,null,null,1437844138,null,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32,null

I've not heard of employers sponsoring visas for people who don't yet work for them. obviously the current system is different, and has already changed quite a bit in the past 5 years - but typically, you have to already be working for a company for them to care enough about you to sponsor you - you also need to fit the fairly narrow restriction on who is allowed to be sponsored, and whether or not the company has advertised the role to british people beforehand, and failed to find a suitable person to fill the role, to then justify then sponsoring and bringing in someone from outside the uk.

It's a fucking nightmare, I can tell you. My wife only just luckily fell on the right side of the cutoff for the post study work visa, and I have a few friends who have struggled to get sponsorship/visas even after working for a british company for a number of years.

Why does it need one? It's silly pretending that England is no different from Scotland or Wales - it's magnitudes bigger in every area; would it really be that difficult to make exceptions instead of creating a parliament for the process? I don't see why that has to be a problem or threat of any kind.

&gt;because if they are not equal it ceases to be the UK Parliament

But they're already not equal. Scottish MPs continue to help make laws that apply to England alone, although no English MPs can make laws on those same matters for Scotland.

&gt;An MP from Glasgow has as much right to vote on devolved matters as an MP from London.

See above.

&gt;Do you have no idea how devolution works?

Yeah, I put that badly.

&gt;All members of the UK parliament should have the right to vote on issues which are the responsibility of the UK Parliament.

But there's the rub - they're not equal any more, are they?

&gt;It's not another country

Scotland isn't a country?

&gt;it's members of the UK parliament voting on issues which affect the UK.

That's the goal. Currently the way it plays is;

&gt;it's Scottish members of the UK parliament having influence/ control over English laws which English members of the UK parliament do not have the equivalent of for Scotland.

&gt; The 26-year-old, who has made over 200 appearances for the Premiership club, has been out of action since the end of September. However, his hopes of a quick return have been scuppered by the news he requires a reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee.

&gt; ""It is desperately disappointing for him and for us, but it is a straightforward operation and he should make a full recovery,"" said Southampton physio Jim Joyce.

&gt;Breastfeeding Allegation In Leicester Response 14th July 2015


&gt;We have investigated this customer’s allegation which we naturally take very seriously indeed.

&gt;The CCTV footage, reviewed by store management, shows the customer in the Leicester store quite clearly during the time in question. We can see no evidence that she was approached by anyone during this period.

&gt;We have spoken to the security guards on duty. They categorically deny behaving in the way alleged. Furthermore the individuals do not fit the description given by the customer.

&gt;We have therefore concluded that the customer allegation is not supported by the available evidence to date. The company would obviously be happy to work with any police investigation into this incident, should this be needed.

&gt;We have tried to contact the customer to reassure her about Primark’s practice on breastfeeding.

&gt;At Primark, we work hard to provide all the comfort and facilities possible to our customers.  Our policy is quite clear. We do not prohibit breastfeeding. In addition, any customer can request a quiet or private area within the store to breastfeed her child and our staff will  do all they can to accommodate such a request.

If those exceptions involve disenfranchising Scottish MPs then yes, it is a problem.

&gt; But they're already not equal. Scottish MPs continue to help make laws that apply to England alone, although no English MPs can make laws on those same matters for Scotland.

But Scottish MPs can't vote on Scottish only laws either. English MPs can vote on the exact same things that Scottish MPs can vote on, they are equal.

&gt;But there's the rub - they're not equal any more, are they?

Scottish MPs vote on the exact same bills English MPs vote on. Scottish MPs votes count for exactly as much as English MPs votes. They are equal.

&gt; it's Scottish members of the UK parliament having influence/ control over English laws which English members of the UK parliament do not have the equivalent of for Scotland.

Scottish members of the UK parliament having influence/control over English laws but Scottish members of the UK parliament do not have the same influence/control Scotland. This is because English issues are decided by the UK parliament, while Scottish issues are decided by the Scottish Parliament.

Silent Joe and Action Dan have decided that Spurs should be fiscally rewarding and successful on the pitch at the same time. They own the only middle-class club in England: too small to be big, too big to be small.

Given that two plans must be executed:

1 - Embiggen the club financially

2 - Be younger (and cheaper) than the clubs you're chasing

Plan 1 is well-underway - new stadium, increased efforts at marketing overseas and at home, getting some NFL dollars, probably a bunch of other stuff I don't know about.

Plan 2 - It seems like they've finally come to their senses here - the Bale money might have actually delayed Plan 2 because, hey, who wouldn't think that all that money might buy you into the top 4? But it didn't, so now, buying stars 1 - 2 years ahead of their stardom is the new plan (which, of course, is a difficult thing to do, to prognosticate development of talent).  Buying younger players and locking them in (if you choose the right young players!) means you get more bang for your buck.

So........I'm excited.  I think this is the best plan - to acquire a lot of youth talent, and then explode onto the scene in our ""it's-bigger-than-the-Emirates"" stadium (you know that will be its unofficial name for many fans) with a cohesive team of fully developed talent entering their primes.",null,0,null,1436884630,null,0,false,0,ct2xs4k,null,t3_3d8mzt,null,t1_ct2xs4k,null,t3_3d8mzt,null,null,null,1437844529,null,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3,null

Silicones have the suffix -cone, -conol or -siloxane. -Siloxanes are volatile so they should evaporate off. The prefix PEG- or PPG- means the ingredient is water soluble, so those silicones may behave differently.

Every year on the 12th of July (or the following Monday, as they wont march on Sunday for religious reasons) they celebrate the anniversary of that victory by putting on orange sashes and marching.

One of the routes they traditionally march down goes through the predominantly Catholic [Ardoyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardoyne) neighbourhood, once in the morning and then back again in the evening. Catholics generally don't like the Orange Order and consider the marches to be a form of intimidation and triumphalism, so they don't want the marches going through their areas. In the past, residents and republican groups attempted to block or attack the marches in Ardoyne, which led to rioting. The Parades Commission, a body established to rule on contentious marches, decided on a compromise agreement where the Orange Order could march through the area in the morning but not again in the evening.

Because it's not the English parliament. You can use the facilities of Westminster to hold an English parliament (elected as such) if that turns out to be practical. I've got nothing against that. 

What I do have something against is elected Westminster MPs being barred from voting on Westminster matters. I have an issue with elected MPs not being elected equally. At the moment a Scottish MP is equal to an English MP. They can vote on Westminster matters, they cannot vote on Holyrood or *whatever the Welsh parliament is called* matters.

We were playing 4-3-1-2 ( or 4-1-2-1-2 depending on lucas' position) in the first half (Bentekers and Studge anybody?) and in the second half we were playing 4-3-3. 

I thought it was really interesting to see Milner in the middle, he's basically a Hendo clone (with better finishing) and i like the possibility of more goals from midfield. 

Any reasons why Moreno was left out? Tex looked really good too.. hope he has a place in the squad when the league starts.

I wonder who's going to give way if (when) Bentekers and Sturridge are both firing on all cylinders. Firminho? Coutinho? One of Hendo or Milner? Or we'll never play 2 strikers again?

If you do not need all of your NZD straight away, it might be best to lock some of them away with 1-month or 3-month term deposits so as to get a decent interest rate.

But if you want to make it about Labour vs Tories, the Tory governments have done vastly more deficit spending than Labour ever did. http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/borrowing-percent-gdp-2000-14-500x370.png

Also if you look at debt-GDP ratio from 1997-2008 (http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/debt-under-labour1-500x394.png)  it basically stayed level (actually slightly lower in 2008 than in 1997 although maybe starting to creep up) so  the deficit spending was balanced very closely by growth (so in real terms, it wasn't even deficit spending). Its only when the crisis hit and the banks got bailed out that the debt went up - and then continued to increase for the the entirity of the coalition government. Yet interest rates were so low during the majority of the post-crash period that the private sector was saying ""please take our money, we're desperate to lend it to you"", but the government was refusing to spend it. 

So if take more adult approach and move away from excusing the failure of one party by the failure of another, its pretty clear that Labour should have been reducing the debt-gdp ratio rather than keeping it steady, but the Tories practically caused a double dip recession by slashing public spending during the private sector bloodbath when they should have acted to prop up demand as the private sector was retreating while the banks were desperate to lend money to the British government.",null,0,null,1436888056,null,0,1436888351,0,ct2zze8,null,t3_3d8e35,null,t1_ct2zze8,null,t1_ct2z514,null,null,null,1437845584,null,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6,null

You could pay off your credit cards and and overdraft and make the repayments on the loan, when your salary goes back to normal the £200 you pay out will mean you just have a salary as you do now. 

Then save a little each month and make overpayments on your loan and can pay it off early. Then you can begin saving.

You said your current take home  is £1,400 (after the deduction for loan advance) you'd have the same amount to live on but without the monthly £100 payment to your cc, never mind the horrible overdraft charges you'll face once the 0% interest period is over.

You're contributions to this site have been thoughtful and honest and genuinely give me hope for the future. However, there seems to be a deep reluctance in the Unionist community for self criticism. Having more Unionists on this sub won't actually change the criticism leveled. *(This sub is actually evenly balanced it's just, a lot of them at this time are otherwise engaged in festivities or hungover)*. Bonfires are not simply offensive to others they actively damaging your own community. 

Some chap recently came on here seeking new [Republican music](https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/3cv8ct/does_anyone_know_where_to_find_new_republican/), i had a chuckle at that. It was archaic, of it's time. It's very rare now for ""new"" Republican music and bands. People simply moved on. It's an old tradition and most republicans aren't that keen to revive it. It was simply of it's time. 

Similarly with the August Anti-Internment Bonfires, which very few survive namely Divis and a few in Derry, it was recognised that they were corrosive to the community and ultimately harmful to it. They were replaced with community festivals like the Gasyard Feile or Feile An Phobail and they brought a vibrancy to the community through Arts Music and Dance. And they are still going strong. 

My Point is that the harmful and destructive aspects of culture should be critically analysed and done away with if necessary, replace them with something better.

It is isn't to be completly dissmissive of Loyalist Culture there are of course Positive elements, which i have spoken about in the past.

null,false,AbeltonSkive,null,null,null,"I spent Friday thru Sunday in the tranquility of Connemara and returned to Belfast on Sunday evening - but I still had Monday off work. My SO is from Louth and had never been to a parade...and nor had I. We chose to not sit in the house all day and headed over to the Lisburn road to see the return of the parade. 

We got our eyes opened. From Shaftesbury square to almost the Kings Hall was 1000s of people lined along the road in deck chairs, there was tents, burger stalls, kids loving it, pensioners that looked happy to be out for the day...and yes loads of people drunk but I can tell you all right now that it was nothing but a party atmosphere. I said to my SO that when we watch the images on the news later it won't be showing all of this and of course I was correct. Yes there was street mess and bottles, but no different than what i see at Feile an Phobail and St Paddys day.

The OO doesn't want me and I don't want the OO but as the OP states, it's not going away and must be reformed to some degree. There are over 3000 marches and it's always the same few that make the headlines for the wrong reasons. 

So how can it resolved? By fucking talking on a mature and balanced level between all involved. The reason why parades in Derry aren't as contentious nowadays is because they thrashed it out with the Apprentice Boys of Derry, it's as simple as that.
The Crumlin road parade is not a Drumcree, it's not properly through a nationalist area geographically the way the Garvaghy road was so in my opinion, with balanced and mature dialogue these 2 sides can come to a compromise. No one seems to want to give an inch though.

As for the bonfires, the only people that should be concerned is the people in loyalist areas in which they burn, in my opinion it has little to do with nationalists unless it's the environmental damage which pains you...if so stop driving your car, burning oil in your central heating system at home and every other damaging act which impacts the environment. The Effigies and posters are ridiculous, offensive and stupid and can be remedied very easily with community help.

I don't get easily offended because I have more going on in my life than getting wound up by cultural differences. My SO didn't get offended by going along yesterday for the craic either and she is from the South. Mud slinging and point scoring is a waste of time and too easy to get caught up in. Political representatives, community leaders and sections of the media stoke up tensions to some degree. Also members of the OO that goad and antagonize protesters in a triumphant and childish manner needs to stop. 

It's the same when an ex paramilitary dies, like Jock Davidson or the guy Bap last week. The fact he came from the loyalist community (Or Nationalist in Jocks case) and had a paramilitary history doesn't take away from the fact that he got taken away from his family. I'm sure they don't see him as an ex paramilitary. Yes I'm sure he got what he inflicted on others but people on both sides carried out horrific, gruesome shit through a horrific gruesome period here. Gloating and sledging every time someone with a history from whatever side dies is a load ballocks that creates more mud slinging and hatred on places like like this and facebook and whatever else.

Anyways, copypasta from my last reply:

I drive an '07 Alfa Romeo GT Blackline, with the 1.9 JTDm engine..


I like the looks of it, seats are the most comfortable I've ever sat in, buckets of torque from the noisy pedal and a load of low-down grunt so it feels like a fast car in the rev range you'd usually drive it, fairly nimble feeling from the steering wheel, returns decent mpg (averaging 50mpg), has a big fuel tank for long trips (about 750-800 miles from a full tank), has a big boot that my dog fits into comfortably, has a lovely cabin with nice quality dash area etc., and of course it's an Alfa...


I don't like, the noise the engine makes.. No getting away it sounds like a clattery bag of spanners... Nowt wrong with it, just these early 4-pot JTD engines have always and will always sound clattery.... Suspension needs constant attention because Alfa/Fiat cheaped out on it, hence bushes wear out, arms squeak, and the springs/shocks are so poorly matched it feels both wallowy and hard/crashy at the same time... the swirl flaps on the inlet manifold are know to detach themselves and grenade the engine and/or turbo.... the quality of the underseal seems to depend entirely on which shift were working in the factory in Itally when it was built, hence you can get one with a top seal job that'll outlast the car, and some that have completely rotted through in 5 years.... my local trusted specialist is a 90 min drive away... the paint seems to be one step up from butter on the hardness scale, so it's peppered in stone chips... there's wind noise and squeaking from the frameless door/window seals... Alfa pre-installed at least 5 unidentifiable rattles in every car (between the dash and the tailgate usually).... Camber isn't adjustable (remember the cheaped out suspension design?) so it tends to eat tyres.... Oh and it's a bit of a money pit that I can't help but keep spending money on...

If you define ""special importance"" as being able to meet our current requirements, yes, I am of special importance I guess :)

Well, tell that to our current government. You have to meet a minimum of £18,600 to be able to bring a spouse over. I guess you could define that as being productive. The rest is just proving you're in a relationship.

All they are saying with the externalities is that the activity of energy industry has a cost that is not reflected in the prices of goods or services. That does not seem too unreasonable.

Anyhoo. It's a 1.2 which drives like a 1.6 without the top end speed. Nimble as fuck with plenty of grunt from such a small engine especially when you hit high revs. Love taking it through country roads at speed and it's just as comfortable on long hauls. 

Doesn't feel like a 1.2 apart from the noise at speed, which is considerably quieter than our old Liana but still quite loud. Also averaging just under 50mpg which is damn good. 

It's just over 3 years old and we got it for £6500 with just over 6k on the clock 6 months ago. With all the gadgets, alloys etc to boot.

EDIT: Oh, slightly more lighthearted story from another comrade: Someone else I know was in the Labour Party Young Socialists around the time they were trying to kick Militant out of the party (1982). Their university Labour Club hired a bus to conference, stopping a couple of times along the way. At the first service station stop, the moderate members passed around word to all the Militants that the bus was leaving in 15 minutes, and to all the non-Militants that it was leaving in 10.

Result: Lots of Trotskyists got abandoned at a service station and Militant were declared ineligible for affiliation at the conference.

What I think the IMF are doing is very specifically using the term ""subsidy"" because they know it's somewhat loaded, and the subtext of the report that they put out is that they're advocating a carbon tax to try to make up for the unpriced externalities.  I'm certainly not against carbon taxes, and I think their framing of it in terms of a subsidy was deliberate because they knew it would get more attention, which displays a certain pragmatism.  Certainly if they'd said ""carbon tax"" most of the press would have crucified them, because people hate taxes, but they hate 'subsidies' to rich oil companies even more!

Passed mine today too!

Lots of weird things happened.

 The other guy I was with had his booking messed up by the company so he couldn't do the test today.. 

an indian guy came with two of his friends who were on a CBR and R1, he had a massive bike with a topbox and panniers which he did his mod1 on, no instructor with them, no hi-vis. He passed and afterwards took off the L plates and rode in a T shirt up to the entrance of the test centre right past the Test woman who was standing near myself having a fag. He stopped and put his gear on but still was riding illegally with no L plates and no insurance/no instructor... she called the cops on him after she just passed him for his test so they probably went looking for him.

Whilst that guy was doing his mod1 2 guys turned up with their instructor, when parking one of them dropped the bike in the spot next to the testers bike, hitting it on the way down.. she was mad but was doing a test at the time.

The instructor lied about how it went down but there were witnesses including myself. that instructor also dropped his helmet when he put it on his bike after that happened..

madness..

All went ok for me though with only a CBT and day+ morning of training for the mod1. 2 minors, both for going too slow first try on the emergency stop and hazard avoidance.

Mod2 time! Will need at least another day on the road before trying that.",null,0,null,1436890790,null,0,false,0,ct31vxu,null,t3_3d8q29,null,t1_ct31vxu,null,t3_3d8q29,null,null,null,1437846713,null,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2,null

The whole parades thing is a complete joke. The bonfires are bad but the parades are worse in terms of parading up contested areas illegally and nothing ever happens. Fuck sure the orange order is deffo on its way out they go around all farmers they know are protestant and up front out of the blue ask them to join the order for free to 'keep up numbers'. And if a farmer said no they will loose friendships over it. 

The more i read about history of NI, loyalists have been the instigators in seriously all the bad shit. The whole paisley civil rights movement stuff jezz... Most of these loyalists choose to ignore and or dont know anything about their own history. They should be ashamed of some of it yet their own community revel in being incredibly homophobic and racist.

As much as i hate telling people what to do. But they have to realise the years on years of violence that it cases and the serious insane amounts of money it wastes year on year is un-sustainable. Not to mention i would go as far to say greater than 50% of all people in NI are against the bonfires.

The true failing here is the the loyalists don't realise their elected representatives are basically taking the piss. They want their vote yet when anything goes on there are _no_ where to be seen in their well expensed fuel and high salary homes.

So really they need to realise its pissing people off so much. You cant make the majority of society walk around people like this for the rest of their lives.

Its pathetic. I am ashamed to be protestant by what the 12th is every year. My grilfriend's family is very much in this mentality of loyalism but they dont see what it is like in belfast and i just cant stand it.

Taking pleasure in keeping your rifle in good working order or enjoying being in the woods and learning the habits of different pest species and when your most likely to find them etc...to me is still a world away from donning a red jacket tooting your horn and going hells bells with 20 horses and a pack of dogs after one petrified fox whilst the followers of the hunt clog up the local road networks with their land rovers parked roughly and unconcernedly half on half off the grass verge. Taking a pride in and enjoying what you do and making sure you do the best job is an important part of a rangers job as it promotes clean kills.

If you make the comparison between a ranger and a member of the hunt. One ranger who is proffesional and skilled at his/her job can single handedly control the population of foxes within an area in a humane and responsible manner with little to no disruption to local residents or farmers beyond maybe a temporary footpath closure. Where as one member of the local hunt needs his or herself and however many others each with a horse, a pack of dogs and a whole entourage or folk following the hunt and then after catching a single fox go and have a booze up. So to me anyway...thats a completely different idea of fun. The rangers enjoyment revolves around what the purpose of his/her job is for i.e pest/population control. Where as the member of the hunt's enjoyment is capsulated in the theatricality and tradition of the event and not (the continuously defended rhetoric) that its beneficial for the local environment.

With a bike, you predominantly control your speed with the throttle and the clutch - and at low speeds it's 90% clutch, 10% throttle.

In a car, a slipping clutch is a bad thing (on the whole). On the bike, it's how they're designed to work (quite literally). So I struggled with the constant need to get into gear and get the clutch out, like I would with a car, when there's a lot more finesse and you're much better off with less clutch. It was primarily understanding that it's ok to be revving the balls out of the engine and just have the tiniest amount of clutch engaged so that you're only just moving. When doing all the slow speed stuff, my instructor kept telling me that it really didn't matter how much noise the engine made, as long as I was always in control with the clutch.

I *do* see an entire *organisation* being branded with the one brush and I think its a fair brush considering the foundation, purpose and practices of the Orange Order and the practices of loyalists (again, *not* simply protestants or even unionists) going out of their way to cause as much offence as possible - its not limited to offending nationalists in Belfast anymore, but everyone who isn't white and protestant. 

Like you say, things are different in the sticks, I think most people but the most bitter/diluded are aware of that and its pretty common knowledge. The problem for me is that I don't live in the sticks and chances are neither do they.

Don't wear Liverpool colours and don't show any support if you sit in the home end. That's culturally disrespectful. Remember we sell out every game and, particularly at a bigger game like one against Liverpool, you have to remember that if you manage to get a ticket you've got one ahead of a Swans fan. That kind of behaviour will harbour resentment.

If you do show colours in the Swans end, you likely would be quickly removed by stewards both for your safety and for the purposes of not spoiling the game for others. You'd be completely safe sat in the the West or South stands, but you would cause a lot of irritation and would be reported pretty quickly for that kind of thing. If you sat in the East end, I'd like to say you'd more than likely avoid getting into a fight, although if the stewards don't get you first a more boisterous fan might force you to remove your colours. Remember that fans here often don't see themselves as spectators, but as part of the club and as such a Liverpool shirt sat in the middle of the noisiest part of the ground is going to be seen seen as an attack on that concept. You'd be seen as actively hampering the atmosphere by many.

I don't mean the tone to sound threatening or anything, I just think you don't have a handle on the cultural side of the British game and you will cause a lot of problems for yourself and others if you aren't mindful of the fact that you're a visitor in a foreign country that is different to your own.

I'm *really* not a fan of your plans, the idea of someone in the home end actively being a supporter of the opposition doesn't sit well with me at all. However, if you're going to do it, be respectful and be invisible! I understand that as your relationship puts you and your partner on opposing teams its a bit more complicated, so I hope you can take what I'm saying as cautionary advice rather than an attempt to scare you off.

Also:

&gt;I swear I really do like the Swans, I just happen to love the reds a little bit more. Go easy on me.

null,false,SpaceboyMcGhee,,Misguided Glory Hunter,null,"Thanks very much for linking to your other post, very interesting.

I would offer though that I think distribution is an unbelievably hard aspect of a keeper's game to analyse statistically. As you point out pass completion is hugely affected by the team's style (if you're throwing out to a fullback every single time you're going to have a much higher success rate than kicking long) and I'd also offer the quality of player you're playing with.  I'm not entirely sure how they mark down a completed pass... if a target man gets his head to flick on a keeper's long kick and possession is then lost, is that a completed pass from the keeper's perspective? I would imagine it is.. and if that's the case then a keeper with a target man of Benteke's calibre for instance would generally have a significant advantage in that category as he's simply going to get his head to a lot more balls than most other forwards regardless of the accuracy of the kick itself. 

Perhaps someone could come up with a metric taking into account the difficulty/length of passes attempted weighted for the ability of the attended recipient to get onto balls regardless of who plays them or something.. eurrgh, sounds messy. Anyway in the absence of such a stat I think we generally have to stick to a more qualitative assessment.. and in that regard I'm still a bit sceptical about Guzan in this particular area. 

On a totally different point, but relevant to your other post, I wonder if anyone compiles a metric for keepers based on saves completed taking into account the relative position that the shot was coming from and hence how hard it was to save.  I've definitely seen something similar for strikers, called like.. weighted expected goals scored.. or something! So I know for a fact that one of the big stat agencies out there is logging every single shot in the premier league and where it's come from... and then assigning a value for how likely someone would be to score from it. 

If you DID come up with such a stat for keepers.. you could then feed that back into the one for strikers too to even out the fact that players are taking shots against different keepers, some of whom are easier or harder to score against.. anyway I appear to have fallen down a speculation rabbit hole, interesting stuff nonetheless!",null,0,null,1436895045,null,0,false,0,ct34wpd,null,t3_3d4v41,null,t1_ct34wpd,null,t1_ct2zzvm,null,null,null,1437848615,null,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1,null

- Expand stadium. Bigger capacity = more fans paying for tickets.

- 'Build the brand' in countries like the US. Adds another big revenue stream that clubs like Tottenham have benefited from.

- Shower players with money. Consistently make big signings ('big' as in good, not necessarily expensive).

- Break the legs of players who refuse to sign (hey, we're a mafia aren't we?).

FFP unfortunately means we have to play by the rules instead of buying our way into the CL. It's an uphill battle that could take us 10+ years to win. I think we are on the right track though.

York is a good suggestion if you like to visit museums and old style town centres and buildings, but I wouldn't visit as a single tourist, the locals are a bit aloof (one of the few areas in the north you'd describe as rich) and it tends to be more of a day trip location for groups - stag parties, racegoers, couples. Also a nightmare to drive around in the summer months. Better to base in Leeds, go on day trips to York (by train) and visit the much calmer Knaresborough, Yorks Sculpture Park, Harewood House by car and spend a couple of days in Leeds doing stuff like the Armories. If you want to see real Britain, go to Headingley and take in a cricket or rugby league match, both of which are in season now and attract very different crowds, both of which will be very accepting of a foreigner who speaks as good english as you clearly do!

Labour seem very quiet. Part of me thinks that nobody has suggested many sensible things because of a conflict of interests (Turkeys as we know don't vote for Chistmas).

All the career politicians would want to be Prime Minister of England. Not the UK. This whole things needs an apolitical investigation with viable options explored. Perhaps even a referendum.

&gt;[On Tuesday 5 September 1882, the Hotspur Football Club was formed by grammar-school boys from the Bible class at All Hallows Church. They were also members of Hotspur Cricket Club. It is possible that the name Hotspur was associated with Sir Henry Percy, who was ""Harry Hotspur"" of Shakespeare's Henry IV, part 1, and who lived locally during the 14th century and whose descendants owned land in the neighbourhood. In 1884 the club was renamed Tottenham Hotspur Football Club to avoid any confusion with an already established team called Hotspur FC.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.#Formation) 

And the origin story of our crest: 
&gt;[Since the 1901 FA Cup final the Tottenham Hotspur crest has featured a cockerel. Harry Hotspur (from whom the club is said to take its name) was famed for his riding spurs, and fighting cocks were fitted with spurs, which can be seen in the crests. In 1909 a former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football to be placed on top of the West Stand and since then the cockerel and ball have been the major part of the club's identity.](https://www.shelfsidespurs.com/forum/threads/history-of-our-badge.8352/)",null,0,null,1436896564,null,0,false,0,ct3606t,null,t3_3da03w,null,t1_ct3606t,null,t3_3da03w,null,null,null,1437849331,null,18,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,18,null

While this may sound bad at face value, it only works if quality players are used and the style/quality of football is at a high enough level to attract attention from bigger clubs. And to make the biggest profits the club needs to be playing in Europe regularly.

I'm of the opinion that it will make Saints a very entertaining and exciting side to watch for the foreseeable future, even if there are a few up and downs along the way.

In regards to the players that have left over the past few seasons, I think this business model has worked perfectly (Lallana, Lambert, Shaw, Lovren, Clyne, Scheiderlein, etc. all making big profits).

* Both have a better fitness record than Benteke - in fact over the last two seasons both have made more appearances than Benteke in league competitions and a striker who we can depend on to make appearances when Sturridge can't is essential.

* Both scored more goals than Benteke last season.

* Both are English but **still** cheaper than Benteke's asking price.

* Berahino especially is more suited to a ground based game, has a little bit of magic that makes him stand out in a pretty ordinary West Brom side. Austin is more suited to an aerial game than Benteke however, having spent most of his career in lower leagues.

Again, I personally **wouldn't** be particularly happy with any of them. We'll have to cut a corner somewhere, I do think we missed a trick with Immobile but he's away and gone to Sevilla. Yarmolenko is far too good to be playing for Kiev and would make a phenomenal striker, but whether he wants to change his position or would be successful even if he did are two completely different issues.

Truth be told there aren't any *top* strikers available this window and even though OP seems to be in denial, Lacazette might be attainable if we can throw enough money at him. Fine, he might fuck off to PSG or Madrid a few years after, but if he's the short-term solution we need, so be it. Only Ronaldo and Messi scored more than him last season. He's the real deal.

Personally when I was a student we just took one each; one person do gas/electricity, one person do water, one person do TV license, one person do broadband.

The fact is that Shodwell had one good game, and cost more than his transfer fee in physio costs (that's a sarcastic joke), and Sinclair was only good when playing at a shit club (that's not a joke, that's a truth).

We don't ruin English talent, we just have a much higher standard of quality so people don't stand out as well.

For example, if the average arbitrary skill value of players at Swansea is 40 and Sinclair is 60, then he stands out. If at City it is 80 then all of a sudden, he doesn't look so great, but moving to City does not change his skill value. The same goes for all players.

Economics are not my field, meh, sue me.

Funnily enough many of these forecasts turn out to be somewhat wrong - case in point the OBR revised down the forecast to 2.3 after last weeks budget and are forecasting 2.2 for 2016 i.e. Not only is our growth well below the historic average (3.8% off the top of my head?) its also slowing. 

Should I also mention that it is also contented that the EU GDP figures are higher than they should be due to a 2014 change in the methods used to calculate GDP?

Anyways, my main point was that if we don't learn from the economic mistakes of other countries we are bound to repeat them. I don't care if its Tory or Labour in power, what I care about is are they competent to govern.

null,false,toomanyairmiles,null,null,null,"'Apex Fallacy' is basically an example of trying to shift the argument and sow doubt, following in the well trodden footsteps of creationism, and as an argument is just about as ignorant as the idea that the Earth is 6000 years old.

MRASJWs would like to *assume* that the feminist concept of patriarchy relies on the idea that all men have the same power as those at the top of a given power structure. It doesn't. In feminist thinking a definition of patriarchy is this:-

&gt;Patriarchy is an unjust social system that enforces gender roles and is oppressive to both men and women. It includes any social mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. 

Feminism isn't claiming that the men at the top of any given power structure have the same power as all men in that power structure - hence the fundamental idea behind the Apex Fallacy is complete bollocks.

Essentially what you're trying to claim by the use of the term is that feminism's concept of male privilege doesn't acknowledge the suffering of the poor downtrodden men at the bottom of a pyramid of power - who, as they see it, have no power or privilege, therefore there can be no such thing as male privilege or the patriarchy.

The fundamental argument as expressed by Dr. Helen Smith herself in an interview on the topic is this:-

&gt;The error in their thinking arises from a collective refusal to acknowledge that the vast majority of male workers toil in the nether regions of our economy. These hordes of men-who make possible feminist lives of leisure-are totally invisible to the harridans who compare women, on aggregate, to the rich and famous alone. Indeed, when judging female progress, juxtaposition is only made with those males at the apex of our status hierarchy. It seems that feminists can discern none but the elite.

Her error in thinking is as obvious as her bias - she is arguing against what *she* sees as the feminist core argument, and her problem is that she doesn't understand that core argument in the slightest. She believes that feminists are elitists and consider only socially powerful men in their thinking and has constructed a nonsense argument against a concept of feminism that she has herself created.

Again this is not the fallacy of composition at all - you would like it to be because that would lend credibility to both your term and argument but it one simply has nothing to do with the other.",null,0,null,1436897821,null,0,1436900038,0,ct36ws4,null,t3_3d9qwz,null,t1_ct36ws4,null,t1_ct35ft8,null,null,null,1437849971,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

offer to take charge of all essential bills (council tax, phone/internet, elec/gas, tv license, anything else), on the condition that everyone paid me £250 upfront. i'd then set up the accounts, and keep a decent record in Excel of ingoings/outgoings. i'd also call my bank and set up a second current account if possible and use it exclusively for this purpose.

ongoing, i'd update the energy company with monthly meter readings so that a big bill doesn't surface at the end of the year. i'd also keep people up to date on the balance of the account with a monthly email. Finally, when it comes to top up payments, i'd withhold the wifi password from anyone who didn't pay up (after a reasonable grace period).

However it's *also* possible that they've played a bit of a political blinder and know getting fox hunting delayed isn't going to play out like we all assume.

I'm still waiting.

As it stands right this second the SNP have played a role in getting ~~two~~ three (EDIT: HRA repeal) Tory manifesto pledges 'delayed' without actually casting a single vote whilst simultaneously endearing themselves to large chunks of the English left in a way Labour have failed to do *on the same issue*.

So yes it could be a rash decision to stick their oar where it don't belong and it will all blow up in their wee nationalist faces *or* it could be the ground work for a future election where a Labour / SNP deal of some sort doesn't look nearly as toxic to England as it did in May. Maybe they're just taking a few hits from folk who didn't like them anyway because it's a great opportunity to show that backbone they kept saying they would lend to Labour?

&gt; Imagine, for example, a separate English parliament. (Northern Ireland and Wales already have assemblies of their own.) This putative English parliament would be responsible for at least four-fifths of the UK’s spending on public services, including health, education and criminal justice.

Pretty soon the job of chancellor of the exchequer in the UK parliament would be hollowed out. A federal government cannot operate if one of its subordinate entities is so huge.

My personal opinion is I'm not particularly fond of the whole 'half way house' thing we have at the moment, and I feel any questions about more fiscal autonomy etc. is just darting around the subject of full independence which would be the only viable form of fiscal autonomy without countless clauses and exceptions we see trying to be defined now.

This seems like a pretty good starting point, but I don't see how it factors in increasing life expectancy, I imagine that this rule of thumb has been around for a while, while life expectancy post retirement age has been increasing. 

Personally, I am currently putting a significant amount more than that away in a pension each year, around 40%, but that is due to my circumstance and everyone is different. I am making the most of not requiring the take home pay while I am relatively young (30) and can.

For anyone who is interested in an actual explanation of the ban as opposed to ""it's just a silly anachronism!"", here's the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House of Commons' explanation:

&gt; 42. The current rules in relation to silence, which are more often honoured in the breach than in the observance, are described on page 391 of Erskine May: ""Members must not disturb a Member who is speaking by hissing, chanting, clapping, booing, exclamations or other interruption"". By contrast, ""when not uttered till the end of a sentence, the cry of 'hear, hear,' offers no interruption of the speech"". Several new Members, while accepting that interruptions of the sort described are not permissible, have indicated that they find it incomprehensible that it is not in order to clap at the end of a speech, a practice which is commonplace in other gatherings and indeed in other Parliaments.

&gt; 43. While we agree that spontaneous clapping at the end of a speech could in no way be interpreted as disturbance of the speaker, there is a danger that such a practice might be open to abuse and could lead in certain circumstances to orchestration of what would amount to standing ovations with the success or failure of a speech being judged not by its content but by the relative length of the ovation at the end. This might not disrupt an individual speech, but would disrupt the tenor of the debate, as indeed would slow handclapping. At the same time we condemn the growing misuse of the traditional cry of ""hear, hear"" and in particular the recent practice of unnecessary noise of this kind from both sides which has routinely accompanied the entrance of the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition before Prime Minister's Questions. Such noise serves no useful purpose and is grossly unfair to the Member who is currently trying to ask a question and to the Minister who is replying.",null,0,null,1436898438,null,0,false,0,ct37cxg,null,t3_3d9jhe,null,t1_ct37cxg,null,t1_ct36dgg,null,null,null,1437850286,null,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27,null

ministerial roles and CEO positions (a) are part of society (b)

This is composition fallacy. The article is an example of this fallacy like it or not. I know this, both from research just now and from my degree in philosophy, in which my area of expertise was modal logic.

men in power (a) are part of men as a whole (b)

How would the subletting bit work?

I've got to disagree with that, since iirc a lot of his late subs into games were to close games out, not to score. Almost like a defensive substitute. He's an authority figure that will do anything for the team to win, you just have to look back at the Stoke game and his antics toward the end to see that (yellow card for kicking away a Begovic goal kick in the dying seconds of an important game). He was a defensive sub at Palace away, Man City away too. In that regard, he was invaluable and worthy of being the ""2nd striker"" (which is misleading, since he was rarely used to chase back games).

From what I recall, Drogba didn't really get subbed on for games we were losing/chasing a win (I only remember Newcastle away as an argument against that), it was mostly Remy who did that (Schalke at home, Hull away). And when he did start, it was mostly when Costa and Remy were both injured.

Well, management is. It's a bit of a stretch to say that funding is, given that the Scottish government's budget for that service is set by the UK government's spending.

&gt; If Scotland relies on English funding, then Scotland should not have voted for further devolution.

I'm not sure that follows.

&gt; Do you think it's fair that Scotland is able to abstract funds from the English pocket to fund its social programs (e.g. free university - by the way, thanks for costing me £18,000 when your elected MPs voted for English fees to rise.) but England is not allowed to reduce funding, because it affects how much Scotland is able siphon from England?

If you're referring to the fact that tuition fees in England are counted as public expenditure, thus generating a Barnett consequential, then I'd agree that's unfair (given that the whole point of raising them as fees was that they were raised privately). I would be interested in knowing exactly why that was the case, as on the face of it it does seem a fairly obvious deviation from the Barnett approach (that said, it's hardly a situation that the Scottish Government has the power to alter).

Similarly, I assume you'd equally see London's ""super sewer"" upgrade being paid from the UK's reserve fund rather than Defra's normal budget, and thus not triggering a Barnet consequential, as equally unfair (ditto the £50 a head subsidy for South West Water customers which was funded the same way)?

&gt; What you are describing is the negative aspect of devolution. I feel absolutely no sympathy for Scotland in this matter whatsoever.

I find the attitude that, while we're all in one union together, that you would actively wish ill on another part a little perplexing. But there you go.

I can't say I disagree.

[It's bad to kill foxes this way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3co3eh/mps_will_get_only_90_minutes_to_debate_repealing/csycjvk).

The current situation is that England has more restrictions on fox hunting than Scotland does. I don't see any contradiction in saying that Scotland should have more restrictions in the future, and that the English restrictions should not be loosened to Scotland's current state.

Whether the SNP should be voting on matters that only affect England is a separate question. Personally I would rather they didn't as my preference would be devo-max/federalism where MPs vote only on UK-wide issues and MSPs/English-equivalents vote on national issues.

If that means England decides to do something I disagree with then, once we're only voting on things that affect each country, so be it. I disagree with Spanish bullfighting too, but I recognise that my representatives aren't part of their system.

But in light of English MPs voting on matters that only affect Scotland (as per English MPs rejecting every single amendment made by a Scottish MP to the Scotland Bill), there is something to be said for exercising what power you do have purely to highlight the problems in our current system.

If you don't like MPs from other countries having a say over matters in England then it sounds like you should be pushing for devo-max too.",null,0,null,1436900572,null,0,false,0,ct38w00,null,t3_3d8ikc,null,t1_ct38w00,null,t1_ct35jxk,null,null,null,1437851426,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

On the 11th it was like any other day/evening.
12th was the same but the area they were staying (ramada) had the bonfires at night.
The closest one we were going to go to but it was toxic black smoke so we turned back so an opportunity was missed.
The other was too late so avoided it but it was noisy and the place an absolute mess the next morning- so although we missed it , it looked negative with all the rubbish and beer bottles and smouldering fires.
From the noise from the crowd , the helicopters and police presence they said they were happy to miss it.
13th we went to the field , it was totally fine and quiet but the bands were still only arriving. That is the atmosphere that needs to be replicated!

We then went to top of the Lisburn road , again it was grand if you like that sort of thing , to be honest we were getting fed up listening to them by this stage- its not really that exciting and very samey.

We then went down to shaftsbury square , from top of tates the bands had finished and it was a nightmare , intimidating and messy , really messy.
In absolutely no way was it a family atmosphere in that area , it was disgraceful , pissing all over the place.

So the feedback i got was that the bonfires might have been fun if they werent a health hazard , the family type smaller ones.
I refused to take them to the bigger ones due to the increased chance of drunken trouble.
That needs to be sorted out , end the late bonfires and aim toward a large family bonfire thats done right.

The marching was fine , im not into it but the feedback from newbies was that it was exciting to see it at the start but it got loud and boring after a half hour , same old thing.

The crowd at top of Lisburn Road were jovial and having fun , at no time did they feel scared and were enjoying it.

Lower Lisburn Road was a disgrace - simply whatever was going on there needs to stop, that was nothing to do with bands or the 12th , just idiots blocked and on drugs.

They said they wouldn't come back on that date again , everything was closed on the 12th and the atmosphere in the town was a disgrace. 
If we had more of the atmosphere like at the field then maybe tourists would come for the weekend.

Furthermore, while Liverpool's debt obligations prior to their sale were well known, United didn't have an excessive amount of debt when they were purchased. The debt was taken on via the means by which the Glazers purchased the club. It very well could be that whomever eventually purchases Spurs would need to take on considerable debt in order to fund their purchase, especially with an asking price as high as it is.

However, at BT we were actively encouraged to say 'sorry' if someone's Mum's phone has been engaged for more than 30 seconds!

Can I say ""Bear with me?"" - Another place with predominantly female callers banned this phrase in a call centre in case (and I'm quoting this next bit) it brings back traumatic memories of child-birth!

And finally, and unlikely unless you're answering 999 calls, but when I worked for BT, we were banned from using the word *please* on a 9, in case a 'customer' misheard it as *Police*.

null,false,Aygers,lfc99,,null,"It seems that he's really good with motivating players, or at least some of them. It's interesting to read one of Milner's recent interviews where he stated he'd be willing to walk through a wall for his new manager. A professional like Milner ... I'm not sure they would say something like that just to endear themselves to the new manager and fans.

On his tactical knowledge, one can see there is a lot there yet somehow he still comes out stubborn and unwilling to adapt. It's curious because in the 13/14 season he was able to deliver so many quality tactical ideas that won points for the team, yet in 14/15 (especially toward the end of the season) it looked like that well dried up. It will be interesting to see what he's learned in that department and how he will develop in the first few months of the upcoming season.

The negatives are that he's quick to alienate certain players. Caroll, Agger, most recently Lucas spring to mind. Some will say that Lucas is not a good example but it's tough not to agree that Lucas is one of the finest DMs in the game yet Rodgers doesn't seem to rate him at all. Maybe some of that alienation tendency carries or carried on toward some of his staff last season as well (Pascoe was his long time assistant, Mike Marsh was also dismissed). I've already discussed his unusual tactical stubbornness, but he also displayed some of that with team selections. The Real Madrid away game springs to mind and also using Emre Can to play at RB when there were arguably better options available. I also get the feel he has a subtle tendency to pass the responsibility on to other people, even if he came out and claiming full responsibility for the 6:1 defeat vs Stoke, it's still a feeling I can't quite shake.

All in all the general opinion is pretty divided. He achieve a lot in the 13/14 season but squandered much of that in the 14/15 season. There were all kinds of factors at play, to be sure, but it's no secret many would like him replaced. It seems like nobody really sees a long-term future for him at Liverpool for much longer, unless he really starts the season well and places high on the table at Christmas time. May well not get that long tho. ",null,0,null,1436901854,null,0,false,0,ct39se2,null,t3_3daeck,null,t1_ct39se2,null,t3_3daeck,null,null,null,1437852110,null,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14,null

* Pedro's rumored buyout clause is €30m/£21-22m

* His current buyout clause was negotiated down in his new contract from his previous buyout clause, with both parties agreeing to do so when he signed his extension earlier this summer

* Luis Enrique's take on the matter ""Pedro's situation is very clear - he has a contract and a buyout clause which, if paid, would see the player depart. I don't want any of my players to leave. I've always highlighted Pedro's worth as a player and as a person.""

* Pedro's say ""It's true I have received important offers but don't want to say more out of respect for my club. My situation is complicated because I want to play a lot of minutes but that is becoming very difficult at Barcelona.""


What does this mean? It's simple.

* It is up to Chelsea to entice Pedro to come to Stamford Bridge. If he is convinced that he can make himself a starter in Jose's attacking three, then I see Chelsea easily meeting his buyout clause. At that point I think Pedro would be enticed by a move to to England.

I would be very happy with Pedro joining and Moses coming back to the squad. We would have depth and quality in attack. Oscar, Willian, Pedro, are some of the best pressing attacking midfielders in the world, exactly the type of player Jose loves. Moses is physical, direct and technically sound and would be a great option off the bench.

There have been moments where I've wondered (particularly 6-1 to Stoke and his stubbornness to play Gerrard at CDM where he got torn apart) whether he's completely out of his depth, but generally when there's a gripe, there's an explanation. I think his biggest enemy since getting here has been Gerrard. I love the guy, he's a legend, been my hero for as long as I've been watching football, but from day 1, when Rodgers came in and said he wanted to take the game to a more patient, composed style of play alarm bells rang for me. 

Gerrard has never been a player who waits for the play, he's instinctive, explosive and at times reckless (all of which made him the incredible player he was in his prime), none of those things are things you can be playing the way Rodgers wants to play and in defensive midfield. Until now I don't think Rodgers been in charge of the club, it's been Gerrard. I think now Rodgers can take ownership of the team and the squad and develop it to greater heights than he could have taken it with Steven.

I firmly believe if we had Sturridge fit last season we would have comfortably been in the top 4. Rodgers took a risk by not playing a recognised striker last season and more often than not it paid off. Injuries to Sakho and Gerrard returning to his usual station at CDM killed momentum after the United game, but he did the best he could with what he had. I think Rodgers has the ability and dedication to take us to a league title in the next 5 years if he's given the time, no matter the caricature that the media and reddit create for him, he's a damn good manager. 

If he's sacked any time soon, I reckon he'll be England manager and I reckon we'll win a major trophy under him.

null,false,oblong89334,null,null,null,"It's complicated. That's the obvious assumption, but it totally depends on how much money people actually pay back.

When they changed from £3k fees plus govt subsidy to £9k fees without subsidy (or at least massively reduced subsidy) people assumed taxpayers would pay less towards the system, since taxpayers provided the govt subsidy. However, it was obvious that more people than previously wouldn't pay their entire loans back, since the monthly repayments had actually decreased (due to a higher repayment threshold, since everyone still pays back 9% over the threshold) and the loans were still going to get written off after a similar period of time. Hopefully this makes sense so far.

The govt originally thought 28% of students would have part of their loans written off. They then realised it was [actually going to be around 45%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-26688018). An economics body worked out that if just under 49% of students had part of their loans written off, the £9k system would actually be more expensive for the taxpayer than the £3k plus subsidy system (see same link). I don't know how it could be more expensive because logically you wouldn't expect that given the cost-slashing, but the government hasn't actually denied that the numbers are this close, just said that things might change given this is a projection for many years in the future.

They're now proposing to increase the size of the loans, but haven't said anything about requiring higher repayments, or stopping loan write-offs. I am concerned about how close we are to the tipping point of writeoffs - if 45% already can't pay their loan back in 30 years, how many more are going to have loans written off if you add an extra £12k on top of that? Obviously losing the grant saves some money, but that was the logic behind the increase to £9k fees and the numbers above suggest that that's fairly close to actually having increased the cost to taxpayers rather than reduced it. And the current government has no particular need to care - it would be a problem in around 30 years when the loans start getting written off.",null,0,null,1436903450,null,0,1436903639,0,ct3awu4,null,t3_3d6hts,null,t1_ct3awu4,null,t1_ct39dj6,null,null,null,1437852624,null,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1,null

You can see at 1.01 the video cuts and we return to the middle of a conversation. What was said that led up to the discussion on depression? Who started it? We dont know because he cut out the convo. He's just looking for hits on his youtube channel.

The important thing to remember is that there have been at least 3 people under a train in the last week. At Caledonian Road, Victoria and Angel. Those are only the ones I've seen in the news this last week, there may be more. 

So the tube staff will be on high alert. They dont want to see someone (especially a kid) die anymore than any of us do.

As other commenters have already noted, the kid was standing at the tunnel entrance by the platform edge. When the kid complains that he is being surrounded. If you look carefully the tube worker who was doing all the talking was standing between the kid and the platform edge. So this member of staff was putting his own life on the line to make sure that this kid didn't jump on the track.

I wouldnt put my life on the line like that for the sake of an obnoxious brat like this kid. Respect to the tube worker but this is what he gets in return! Was it worth it?

I'm a train enthusiast myself and the information on this kids video is all nonsense. Other commenters have also said the same. No tripod is allowed on a platform, a smaller tripod is a trip hazard as people wont see it when rushing for a train. There is no freedom of Panorama on the Tube, you have to pay to enter the tube.

It's not supposed to be nice. It's not just a rehab centre for murderers so they can happily sit in meetings and chat about their emotions.

Which type of prisoner do you think is easier to manage, mentally healthy or mentally unhealthy?

Which type of prisoner do you think is more likely to be fit to rejoin society at the end of their sentence, mentally healthy or mentally unhealthy?

What purpose does intentionally neglecting their mental health serve? Is there any evidence that this is beneficial to society in anyway?

We do not have the death sentence and we recognize that cruel and unusual punishment not acceptable, so people should not be subjected to a prison experience that drives them to suicide.

&gt;I don't personally agree with going beyond the call of duty to bring comfort to people convicted of horrible crimes sometimes horrible things happen to horrible people. It can be natural to not feel too bad about the death of a child killer.

This. Ever since the general election there have been all these analysis about why the LibDems and Labour lost in Scotland, and in nearly all of them it's like the SNP had nothing to do with it. The fact they annihilated the LibDems and crushed Labour, at the same time in very different political environments, don't seem to register. They built a ""big tent"" kind of alliance that included everything from Aberdeenshire to the Borders, including the Central Belt. Anyone who knows Scotland knows that this is like getting approval from the Home Counties and the North East of England at the same time. It shouldn't be possible, but they did it.

As for reasons why they are so expensive, there are a few.

* there aren't enough good English players around to fill the squad quotas for the top clubs. Supply and demand.
* statistically, intra-league transfers are more expensive than inter-league transfers. As an example, how man comments have there been in this sub about how people would accept less money from a foreign team than a direct rival? It's like that in the real world too. As the richest league, our domestic transfers are going to trend pricier than in other countries, and I think you'll find that applies to foreign players moving between English clubs as well as English players (Torres and Mata are probably the most overpriced Spanish players on your list).
* there's the idea that players with Premier League experience are a safer bet, and that increases their perceived value.",null,0,null,1436905480,null,0,false,0,ct3cbzu,null,t3_3dam21,null,t1_ct3cbzu,null,t3_3dam21,null,null,null,1437853480,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

null,false,Masterofknees,logo,,null,"&gt; any good readings on how to determine what is good defending in soccer? (literally no clue here)

The tricky thing about defending is that the best kind of defending is the least flashy one, tackling is fancy but you can argue you only need to do that if your positioning was iffy to begin with. It's complicated, it's basically about limiting the opposition's attacking options as much as you can, like I said positioning is absolutely key, especially in relative to your other defenders. It'll be easier to understand when you begin watching high level play, if you focus on the defenders and watch what they're doing you'll eventually get it.

&gt; for reals, who's our biggest rival? wikipedia wasn't too enlightening here

Manchester United, quite easily too. Chelsea are probably our second biggest rivals at this point.

&gt; how much do you guys love angelino? because i already love the kid

One of our more exciting prospects, a lot of people around here love him and are really excited about him. Hopefully he does well for you in New York.

&gt;any good readings on the history of Man City?
 
The interesting stuff mostly happens post 2011

&gt;any good readings on how to determine what is good defending in soccer? (literally no clue here)

 Book wise?  Don't know but Kompany has gone off the boil so don't take any defending knowledge from him.  Certain teams have different defending tactics.  For example, Arsenal rely on Koscielny to keep them out of trouble. Chelsea tend to park the bus (all their players behind the ball). Southampton have been pretty solid defensively the past few years despite their best players being picked off.

Mhairi Black's appeal was brilliant earlier. If it wasn't for the fact that some SNP voters might be put off with an association with Labour, a ""national unity"" coalition of Labour-SNP would be my ideal thing to vote for, with the SNP running in Scotland and Labour running in England. They could stand against austerity and offer a government that values Scotland and England.

As it stands though, the English electorate is scared of the SNP (thanks, media) and the Labour Party is having a competition to see how much it can agree with the government, so it would never happen.

I have to disagree with you here though, i'm not an environmentalist but I am a **tax payer** and quite frankly, I'm pissed off living in a place that struggles to keep vital services running due to costs and cuts but will happily fork out thousands and thousands of pounds in public money to pay for repairs, cleaning and emergency services each year due to bonfires erected by low intelligent thugs. Thugs who set them up anywhere they please fueled by the need to express their idea of superiority over 'themmuns'. 

What I do find hilarious is that if I was to set five tires on fire out my back tonight then it would be a criminal offense. Yet hundreds on the 11th is still allowed because authorties are too bloody scared to act in fear of a violent retaliation.

Gas annual usage 7084kWh, electricity 4277kWh and my current supplier is Sainsbury's Energy (BG reseller) on their Fixed Price February 2016 tariff. 

Just done a meter reading. Sainsbury Energy because its BG's back end immediately updates your account when you do and tells you how much you've used since the last one. I did the last one on 5th June, five and a half weeks ago and I've used £55.95 of gas and electric so at £65 a month its definitely not an unrealistic monthly DD less than my usage will be overall over the year as some companies do to try and con you into signing up.

Apparently according to [MoneysavingExpert Cheap Energy Club](https://cheapenergyclub.moneysavingexpert.com/home), if I change to GB Energy I can get it down another £5 a month. If you've not already done it I suggest going to the MSE Cheap Energy Club site and doing a comparison using your actual usage figures for the last year which should be on your last bill you got.

Edit: DAE find it disgusting that Sainsbury's Energy are a British Gas reseller but are British Gas to the point the DD in the bank comes out as British Gas, their website is basically British Gas's with a Sainsbury logo and orange theme  and yet work out £220 a year less than British Gas's cheapest tariff for me?

&gt;Ok, as I want to be able to sell everything in the system I would like to force things to be sold in bundles.
I can negotiate all prices. And if you want to buy two or more things I may be able to split up ""bundles"".
For payment, if it is allowed, I would like bank transfer.  

TimeStamp/Pics: http://imgur.com/a/rRuDy 

IIYAMA B2888UHSU 4k 27"" monitor, very good quality - £320 + free shipping

Gigabye Windforce R9 290X + EVGA supernova 750W B2 semi-modular - £255 + free shipping (PSU comes boxed with all accessories, GPU comes mostly boxed, no accessories)

I5 3570K + H80i - £165 (same as a new 4690K, possibly higher performance if you overclock with the h80i)

""Special media server bundle"" MSI Z77A-GD55 motherboard (boxed with all accessories)+ Intel Celeron G1620 (has cooler), the reason I am advertising this as a media server bundle, and its low price, is because none of the front panel headers work with this motherboard. Meaning that the only way to turn a PC with this motherboard on or off is with the physical switch on the motherboard. As a media server will not be turned on or off regularly it will not be as much of a hassle.  - £60 

Corsair Vengeance Pro gold 2 x 4gb - £40 

LG Blu-Ray drive - £35

Crucial CT240M500SSD1 256GB SSD, very fast - £60

Windows 8 (free upgrade to 8.1 and 10) NON OEM KEY ONLY, meaning you can change PC parts without buying a new copy of windows - £65

Corsair 200r £35

2TB Internal HDD = £30 

Corsair K70 cherry blue, gunmetal grey, red RGB - £75

ROCCAT kova[+] - £20

I am open to any offers, and if you want to buy the system as a whole please contact me. All prices do not include shipping, unless stated. 
Additionally I am going to leave the system as a whole up on Gumtree to see if I get any offers. Due to this I will not be able to sell anything for 4 days.

So clearly hospitals have been sold off. The hospital bought by Circle was clearly struggling beforehand, and wasn't left in a much better state - irrespective of the suspected bias of one of the people on the board of 15 investigating it. It's also fairly clear to see that Circle had/have influence on government, due to their financial links to the Conservative party, so it's possible they weren't the best candidate, and were awarded the contract due to financial influence (no way of telling for certain though). There was a clear lack of oversight within the hospital, with the Trust board and the management team failing to communicate properly, and subsequently blaming each other for the failings of the hospital. Their tenure as owners started well, mortality rates dropped to below the average, but as money ran short, so did the quality of care.

Ireland switched over to the same type of plug as the UK uses when we rolled them out in the 1950s &amp; 1960s, though that was more the practicalities of wanting to keep the same plug type used in the North &amp; South of the island. They were actually using Schuko in places at the time, but decided against that nationally. They just took the UK standard, gave it an Irish standards number, and implemented it as their own. Simple, effective, and an example of Ireland adopting a British standard. Wikipedia's got the relevent links [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets_-_British_and_related_types#Irish_I.S._401) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuko#History), but specifically here's the reasoning:
&gt;In parts of the Republic of Ireland, Schuko was commonly installed until the 1960s. For safety reasons and to harmonize with the UK (with which Ireland has a long-standing free travel arrangement) and avoid having a different outlet type in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the Republic standardized on BS 1363 (transposed into Irish Standards as IS 401 (Plug) and IS 411 (Socket outlet). Schuko has been phased out of use in Ireland and will be encountered very rarely. Some hotels provide a Schuko outlet alongside BS 1363 outlets for the convenience of visitors from the Continent.

That all aside... while there's logic to the idea, I don't see it ever happening. A common plug standard makes sense to have on one landmass. A common postcode system?

Nationalism is fairly fundamental to the way that modern people in the developed world live their lives - it is a set of assumptions, and a way of framing your attitude towards the world which is self-reinforcing. Two people look at the same events and the same facts, and draw completely separate conclusions, more often than not to agree with what they already believed. 

For instance, one person looks at a bad government policy and says 'that is representative of the difference in culture between Southern England and Scotland', and another person says 'that is a bad policy' or 'that is a bad political party', because one of their fundamental assumptions about the world is that they are inherently a citizen of that country, in an indivisible way. Even if they strongly disagree with that idea, they are still part of the same group, or the same tribe, as the political party, or the electorate who put that party in power. And neither of those two people is in particular right or wrong.

What does mark the SNP and their supporters out at this moment from the Unionists is their optimism, their hope that by changing their indivisible group membership, they can solve problems which should have been solved a long time ago. And they may be substantially correct in that (by forming policy which does genuinely align more closely to the values of most people in the country, or by getting rid of entrenched bad practices or a culture of indirect corruption), but they are also substantially wrong, because much of the disenchantment people feel is inherent to the struggle between sections of the population with opposing interests, and living in a world where these battles go on endlessly in front of you, without resolution. 

For instance, a policy like free prescription charges would get a much different reaction in a Scotland 20 years after independence than the near universal support which it has seen, because it is genuinely difficult to decide what is the right thing to do - by going from a means tested to a universal system, you are helping some people who are vulnerable but aren't able or willing to claim, but you are also giving a lot of money to a lot of people who don't need it. That policy in the independence scenario would be the subject of wearying and interminable debate, and a large percentage of the population would disagree whatever was done.

Actually I think the SNP were happy to get rid of the Barnett formula provided they got full control over their own fiscal affairs. David Cameron is reluctant to hand over any powers beyond the Smith Commission, he's never going to accept giving the Scottish government enough power to justify the removal of Barnett. 

&gt;How can the West Lothian question be answered when the SNP are both against EVEL and changing Barnett?

These aren't the only two options. By far the most sensible thing to do is devolve the whole country into a true federal system and appoint the same powers to each devolved assembly (like, for example, the German federal system). 

The current proposal is one where 4 areas of the country have their own regional assemblies, each with completely different levels of power, all subordinate to a national parliament. The largest chunk of the island only gets representation in the national parliament (with the exception of London). The national parliament is supposed to serve the purpose as the seat of the ""devolved"" English government, has overlapping jurisdiction over the affairs of Wales, London and NI and is also the place where decisions are made on the national level. Scots get a raw deal because they're being represented by 2nd tier MPs who will only have part-time relevance, the English get a raw deal because they're still subordinate to the national parliament and don't get the regional representation enjoyed by the Scots and others, other places with regional assemblies are in some undefined limbo because they are devolved but aren't Scotland. 

The problem EVEL is that what constitutes an England-only matter is incredibly subjective, and will throw up endless arguments about every piece of legislation because there will inevitably be some knock-on effect for Scotland, and it looks likely that English MPs will still get a vote on matters that will directly affect Scotland financially because the budgets are linked. It also begs the question, if Scottish people can only get reduced representation in Westminster and can supposedly make decisions that affect them only in Holyrood, what purpose would Westminster actually serve? I think the establishment had a closer shave than they would have liked with the independence referendum last year, if they want to guarantee an independent Scottish state in the future the best thing they can do is make themselves irrelevant. EVEL is a rushed attempt at a one-size-fits-all solution that will fall apart one way or another in due course. In principle it is good, but the proposed implementation is terrible. The best thing that could be done would be to devolve the current powers of Holyrood to appropriate subdivisions of the rest of the UK, rigidly-define their powers and the powers of the national parliament and put everyone on the same footing, because we have a mess at the moment.

We need to slow down a bit here. That Sky article is very misleading.

First, it is entirely based on ""reports in Spain."" As far as I've seen, SPORT is the only one reporting, and they're apparently not the most trustworthy. Their first story claimed Chelsea are interested, and we had both Mourinho and Fabregas call him in an attempt to lure him to London. The second story was quotes from Pedro refuting the first story, saying he hasn't been in touch with Mourinho. He does confirm that his buyout was lowered and there have been offers, but nowhere does he mention Chelsea is one of them.

The Sky article seems to be combining those two SPORT reports. The title itself is misleading, as the ""Pedro says Barcelona have offers for him"" should be separate from the ""amid Chelsea interest,"" as they come from separate reports. The fact that Pedro refuted the first SPORT article, the only one saying we're interested, makes me question whether we are actually trying to sign him at all.

It's generally accepted as a difficult but rewarding course. You'll likely hear at the beginning of the year that they really like to push their postgrads, and that's accurate.

Regards modules, I'm really not sure. IIRC lots of people found 'History of Analytic Philosophy' (or a title to that effect) pretty dry.

Frege is massive here, and most argue over-represented. St Andrews' philosophy department is one of the more logic/analytic-focussed departments. You're probably aware of this if you applied, though. If not, I wouldn't worry though: the moral subdepartment is certainly capable of teaching good content well; it's just that the 'Logic and Metaphysics' subdepartment is much more renowned.

Peter Clark (an ex-Philosophy lecturer who has retired and taken the role of Vice-President) typically runs a non-credit 'Basic Logic' class for postgrads who want to brush up on formal logic. Even if you know logic well, it's worth going along to just for Peter Clark.

&gt;What's making you hesitant about coming to study?

First, the cost (£1500 increase from last year?!), plus that I've had a promising job interview. If I get the position, I'll do that; if I don't, I'll go back to St A.

&gt;More so, how is St Andrews in terms of social aspect for PG's?

I'm not even going to bother trying to explain St Andrews social life. I had read so many explanations and comments on it before arriving, and nothing did it justice at all. It's unique, look forward to it. Specifically about PGs, though, there's not so much I can really say. The community is strong and slightly insulated from the undergrads. In 2014-15, the philosophy postgrads were typically to be seen with one another.

&gt; I'll be living in accommodation (Fife Park)!

I don't know of anyone from Fife Park because it was demolished before I got to St Andrews. It's now rebuilt, so at least it should be warm in the winter. The neighbouring DRA, however, is popular. Most complain of its distance from town, though. It's the accommodation closest to the university's sport centre/gym, if that matters at all to you.",null,0,null,1436910233,null,0,1436910589,0,ct3fj7a,null,t3_3d50rb,null,t1_ct3fj7a,null,t1_ct2ot0i,null,null,null,1437855552,null,2,false,standrews,t5_2st3h,2,null

And that's kind of my point - if he'd stayed at Chelsea for the rest of his career, scoring 25 goals a season and winning them trophies (as I'm sure Torres thought he would when he forced the move away) then I'm pretty sure our opinion of him right now would be very different. The fact that we like him now is largely because he was useless for Chelsea. 

Chances are you're right and we won't go back to liking Sterling - he'll either be successful and we'll resent him, or he'll flop and we'll stop caring and thank the whole saga for letting us profit from him. But I wouldn't entirely rule out the possibility of him coming back to Anfield at some point (he's still got 12-15 years of his professional career left, after all), at which point most people would probably get over this whole bullshit saga fairly quickly.

It'll show you all the canal and other routes.

If you're near Stratford, you are connected to a large network of great off road cycle routes. The Olympic Park at stratford connects to Hackney via canal paths (Victoria park etc), Hackney marshes, Islington and lots of other areas. All these areas including the Olympic park have great cycle paths, are also really beautiful, and not a road in sight. I always take these routes if I'm not in a hurry to get home.

You shouldn't be too worried about cycling on the roads.

You can get one of two things. Campylobacter, which is really common (most common food borne illness, I think) and generally means you get the shits and then get better. Although it's pretty common, I can't find anything quickly about Campylobacter in the UK other than chicken. 

Trichinosis, on the other hand, is a nasty parasite. A lot of people used to get it and some would die. Now, because of laws on what you can feed swine, plus sanitary and safety laws, there are few cases in the USA where I'm from and little to none reported in the UK for a while. Even if you get it, it's treatable with medication.

Most people say to cook your pork to 160°F to kill the bugs. That also makes it really dry. A well done pork chop is 160°F. Medium is like 150°F. Trichinae are killed at 137°F.

Why would we lose access to our most important markets?  Ignoring Switzerland and Norway, where similar deals would be open to us, the remaining 7 of the EU's top 10 trading countries have no existing trade deal with the EU and they all have access and trade well with these markets.

Look for yourself:    

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_European_Union

And compare it to those outside the EU who the EU has deals with:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_free_trade_agreements

Countries like Brazil, India, Japan, US, China, Russia - all among the EU's biggest trade partners.

Of course we'll keep trading with them.  No problems there.

&gt;**It would be a human rights catastrophe as ""little Britain""...would become inward looking and right wing.**

What an odd thing to say on a thread about an article declaring the left must now leave.  Indeed outside the EU we might actually see an empowered left as they become empowered to write policy on what has up until now has been shared and exclusive EU competences.   Finally they'll have some room to swing some different ideas around.

That we should then become 'inward looking' just as those who wish to make their own free trade agreements finally get what they want is also peculiar.  If anything the impetus would have to be one of more outward looking and broader in its scope.

There's certainly no reason why a UK bill of rights answerable to UK  High Courts should be a 'human rights catastrophe'.  The EU isn't the Island of Doctor Moreau.  If we stop paying homage to The House of Pain we're not going to revert back into more bestial form and become uncivilised.

We could actually become trendsetters in this regard.  We were certainly ahead of the ball when we first joined.

&gt;**Millions would have to move (many from the EU back to Britain).**

Nobody would have to move.    

The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties would apply. In which are articles that are founded on 'acquired rights’, which people accumulate over time and which stand despite future treaty changes.

The HoC library has stated, 

           ""Generally speaking, withdrawing from a treaty 
            releases the parties from any future obligations 
            to each other, but does not affect any rights or 
            obligations acquired under it before withdrawal.”

There is also precedent for this when Greenland left the EEC and what had entered in the European framework were acquired or vested rights.

Essentially if you're legally here or legally there when it happens that's called a home run and you're good.   

          ""Upon leaving the EU, the UK and the EU would 
           still be bound by the 1969 Vienna Convention 
           to honour the existing free movement agreements 
           as already made use of. This means that no 
           member state citizens already in the UK or UK
           citizens abroad would be forced to leave...the 
           Vienna Convention would guarantee the right 
           to remain for Britons already in European 
           nations through acquired rights.""

Which is nice as technically I'm one of those 2 million people Peter Mandelson's British Influence site like to try and put the willies up in this regard, by telling us we'd be forced to repatriate (the 2 million figure is actually based on property or temporary residence,  not residence).

https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201155/volume-1155-I-18232-English.pdf

&gt;**We'd lose freedom of movement over a huge continent.** 

Indeed we would.  You've got that one.   

But that doesn't mean freedom to travel to do business, and prior to the EU we didn't need visas for up to 6 months of travel - as many non EU countries also get.  If you're a student or planning to be working overseas for longer than 6 months in all likelihood you'll have to apply for a student visa or work permit - just like many, many other countries do.  Bit of a paperwork hassle but nothing when weighed against being able to control our own immigration so services can be planned for, to return back control of our fisheries, and make our own free trade deals.

&gt;**There's even an increased risk of war - the EU has mostly seen an end to the wars that ravaged Europe for centuries.**

Norway and Turkey aren't in the EU and they contribute to EU battlegroups.  So we could still do that if one wished.  We'd still be in NATO so we'd still be there for them in case of external threats.  No issues there either.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_Battlegroup#Contributions

It's democracy and trade that has led to increased peace in Western Europe, and we'd be leaving a democratic deficit but none of the trade, so no problems there.  The other thing that helped peace in Western Europe was an existential threat in the Cold War, NATO, and a several hundred thousand US GIs based in Germany for much of the latter part of the 20th century.

And remember the EU in its current incarnation, the bit that we're talking about leaving, has only been around since the early 1990s, so it's a bit rich crediting them for stopping centuries of European war.   They've also recently dropped the ball on Libya and Syria, and whilst not wholly to blame, or even mostly, they made a complete dog's breakfast out of the whole Euromaidan issue which opened the door for a belligerent in its East to come in.

All in all we can confine many of those concerns to Room 101, or take them with a no small serving of salt.

- .9 goals per 90 minutes played. That's the highest rate in Ligue 1, and on par with Aguero, Costa, Remy, Cisse in the PL.

- 2.1 successful dribbles per 90. For a forward, that's only behind Sterling, Aguero, Perez in the PL; and Fekir and Martial in Ligue 1.

- 0 assists, but .9 key passes per 90 (passes leading to shots). So he's not a big provider, but that's the same number as Harry Kane. Fairly average.

Of course, per 90 stats for substitutes are skewed higher due to fresh legs, among other things - see Remy and Cisse. But in the 6 games he started last season (only two of which he finished the full 90) he scored 3 goals. Still a very respectable return.

He thrived under Bielsa; hopefully Poche's system is similar. That plus being Belgian could potentially mean he'd be comfortable slotting right in.

The only snag I see is that Marseille's squad is kind of falling apart, with Gignac, Imbula, Ayew, and Payet all leaving.

Officials at Celtic Football Club have decorated the facade of their iconic home ground with a design that wraps both ends of the venue and stands 21 metres tall and 202 metres long.

It features 58 of the club's most famous players including current captain Scott Brown, Billy McNeill, Henrik Larsson and Jimmy Johnstone along with words; 'Paradise - Where Legends Are Made'.

""We are delighted with the sensitivity and thoughtfulness of the design while being awestruck at the sheer scale of it,"" said Celtic's head of marketing and multimedia, Kevin McQuillan.

""Celtic is one of the major brands in world football and our stadium development shows the esteem in which our players are held and their value to the club's heritage.

""The fans' response to the new look of Celtic Park has been magnificent.

""It was vital that we could produce something that they could be proud of and applying 'Paradise' - how our supporters commonly refer to Celtic Park - quickly became central to the project.""

The design was created by Frame, a Glasgow-based creative marketing agency, and will be admired by the thousands of supporters who arrive at the stadium for Wednesday night's Champions League qualifying match against Stjarnan of Iceland.

""We're immensely proud of our local community,"" said McQuillan. ""We've seen an incredible regeneration project transform the look of Glasgow's east end in recent years and Frame has helped us ensure that Celtic Park is one of the most striking landmarks in the area and something the city can be proud of.""

Frame is in its second year working with the Parkhead club.

""The inside of Celtic Park is recognised and revered throughout world football and we wanted to help make it unmistakable from the outside as well as visible from far and wide,"" said Keli Mitchell, client services director at Frame.

""The new branding really captures the spirit of the club and the people who've made it special over the years, we're delighted to have played a part in bringing this to life.""

Frame's final design was supported by international sports artist, Jim Scullion. Scullion has been involved in producing artwork and design for Celtic for 30 years.

""It was an honour to be asked to play a part in a project that I knew would be loved by the fans of a club I've supported my whole life,"" said Scullion.

""Younger fans may not be so familiar with the achievements of the likes of Sandy McMahon, Jimmy Quinn and Jimmy McGrory, but it is magnificent that the club has chosen to recognise their achievements alongside the other greats who have proudly played for Celtic.""",null,0,null,1436915056,null,0,false,0,ct3ijub,null,t3_3db0w5,null,t1_ct3ijub,null,t3_3db0w5,null,null,null,1437857826,null,2,false,CelticFC,t5_2snki,2,null

*Its now about 8 o'clock by this stage I had planned to put my suit on and look a bit more respectable, that wasn't a an option now.*

Crowds are picking up so I inform spectators that we need an area kept clear for the annual Kingsmill memorial service. Local district parade takes of from the orange hall and sets off up the Brook, I get handed some hymn sheets to hand out, parade loops round the fountain back round the bottom square and we have the memorial service. Me in steel toe caps.

Parade moves of down the village to meet the visiting districts for the main parade.

Parade is held back 15 minutes to allow the chapel to clear after mass.

Parade starts (9.45) and I set up the barriers by the squares and radio to other marshal to do the same, at their posts.

Send a man from the square away to help with car parks.

Direct parade up the village and check vehicles for parade passes.

Try to keep things flowing.

*County Armagh has the largest assembly of Orangemen in the world, as such the buses which drop them off often have to do two runs to pick up another district, so there is usually a gap an hour or so in length halfway through*

During the break I chat with some spectators. ""Could you not have organised better weather?"" I laugh a hollow laugh for the 10th time today.

Armagh district comes in as expected, then the busses play leapfrog and nobody is in the right order, which is fine except when one district gets split in two and to other districts arrive in between them. The hours break gets longer whilst it gets sorted out. 

Potter about the square keeping an eye on people and talking to the police. Nothing much to worry about. St Johns are happy too.

Parade gets moving again and things work OK from there.

Check more vehicles.

Parade passes, talk to the marshals that have fell in behind the parade.

move barriers to pedestrianise main street, help get a few cars out of the way.

Walk down the street talk to a few people along the way, call into the hall get a bite to eat. Talk some more.

Walk round the field, talk to a few vendors make sure everything is going OK. 

Get alerted to an unofficial charity collecting in the field, explain to him he's not supposed to be here, he agrees to leave. He then starts collecting again as soon as my back is turned, I walk him out.

Check on car parks, seems to be working better now.

Keep an eye on things until parade kicks off again.

Usher parade vehicles in at the right spot during first wave, goes well.

Second wave busses aren't back yet one has broken down, two districts already away and boarding, run after Loughgall to stop them before the busses to avoid build up at the end point. Its already been stopped.

Talk to some men and the police until we get the word to go. 

Send them on walk back, give my radio to the marshal leading the next district.

Get a new radio, keep the cars moving.

Parade over vendors try to get out, direct them away from the crowds. 

Help clear the PA system of the the stage. Collect invoice of PA guy, deliver invoice to committee member who's to deal with that.

Direct men to the field to clear up, I go to the town hall to clear up.

Gather barriers from outside legion, group them together for collection later

Help clear fields of rubbish.

Search for lost barriers , drop them off with the rest.

Is there any bank I should avoid? I mean, is it rude to find somewhere that I think would be better and go to them if I don't hold an account with them?

I note that you have yet to provide a link to a single actual source to prove what you emphatically claim is the truth.  Much like your beloved religion, really.  It's not up to those who doubt someone's extraordinary claims to go and prove them right.  This may be fine in religion, but in any rational field, such as biology, this approach is simply absurd.  Go read any book on biology, I recommend books by Richard Dawkins, an actual biologist.  He'll explain in great detail why, in science, the burden of proof is always on those making the claim and never on those doubting it.

&gt;If you want to be freed from the burden of your own ignorance, it is up to you to make that happen.

No, the burden of proof is on the one making extraordinary claims.  The claim that ""certain diseases that are more common within White people like Cystic Fibrosis **due to this practice**"".  The ""due to this practise"" part is highlighted as that is the claim in contention, not that genetic diseases exist and this is ironically what you keep ignoring.  But, again, I might as well try explaining this to a 2 year old, they might actually stand a chance of understanding such a simple point.

&gt;I hate cunts...Instead of getting angry at me

That's the second trait you are clumsily attempting to project onto me.

Oh, and whilst you're insisting so hard on how intelligent you are, you may want to refrain from saying things like ""ROFL"" as a stand alone sentence.  Just a tip.

Is random occurrences that are subsequently condemned and taken down constitute a recurring theme. Do you really think Orangemen who lay down poppy wreaths for the orangemen who died fighting Nazism respect Nazism? Same goes for the countless loyalists that march in memory of fallen soldiers who fought nazism. As for racism in loyalist areas you have to acknowledge that loyalist areas typically have cheap rent and overall have more ethnic minorities. This is backed up by the 2011 census that shows East Belfast has double the ethnic minorites than west belfast despite both constituencies having roughly the same population. Immigrants aren't evenly spread across belfast. Rallies have been held after major events in east Belfast to show that the overall community reject racism. The PUP along with Alliance and have been doing great work on trying to combat this by helping the victims and helping the police.

We on the left want to see a strong and fair society - that would not happen if Greece had left the EU and refused to reform. The Greek economy would have tanked, with the wealthy buying up all possible assets in order to secure their wealth whilst the poor would lose their jobs (if they still had one) and not be able to rely on a safety net or benefits system because there wouldn't be any money in the treasury to dole out. Even if the Greek government did have money after Greece left the EU it would be of such little value that imports would be almost impossible to afford.

If Owen Jones wanted the EU to simply prop up Greece, what good would that do? All it would do is keep a corrupt and backwards system in place and push the problems further down the line, magnifying them in the process. 

The Greece/EU deal is the fairest possible. Spain, Romania, Bulgaria, and other EU states were in a worse situation than Greece was but did a hell of a lot more with the smaller amount of money they were given by the EU. This deal forces Greece to pull its weight. The deal is also much fairer to the Greek People than a Grexit or a prop-up because it forces Greece's economic stability to improve, ensuring a more stable society with more funds for social programmes in the long term. The deal also ensures that the rampant tax avoidance in Greece comes to a halt - what is fairer than making sure everyone pays their fair share into the communal pot?",null,1,null,1436917538,null,0,1436918771,0,ct3k12r,null,t3_3dal6v,null,t1_ct3k12r,null,t3_3dal6v,null,null,null,1437858750,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

Nobody in UKIP, and none of the sounds coming out of Conservatives for Britain, or Business for Britain, or the Better Off Out campaign, are talking about that alternative.  For the simple reason over 70% of people want either a lot more immigration controls or some more immigration controls and the EEA doesn't provide for permanent immigration controls.  Some temporary emergency stuff but nothing that cuts the cheese.

Not being in the EEA does not mean not being in EFTA, the European Free Trade Association.  Nor does it exclude being an Associate Member, or even a simple FTA like Mexico.   Trade isn't a problem.  

Interestingly when the Institute of Economic Affairs ran a Brexit Prize in 2014 for proposed Brexit papers and proposals, not a single shortlisted or prize winning entry backed the EEA option.  They were all either EFTA or FTA based.

http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/research/brexit-prize-final-shortlisted-entries

&gt;We wouldn't be in the same position as Switzerland or Norway. I don't think either of those is a fair comparison.

No.  We wouldn't want to be in Norway's position, although showing how they can contribute to the EU from outside it in other regards is a fair demonstration.  We could actually be in a much better position than Switzerland, and we'd still have all the assurances of the WTO and as both we and the EU are singatories and as such classed as Most Favoured Nations the WTO requires that:

       ""[A] WTO member must apply the same conditions 
        on all trade with other WTO members, i.e. a WTO 
        member has to grant the most favorable conditions 
        under which it allows trade in a certain product type 
        to all other WTO members.""

There are 3 exceptions to this, and none of them apply to a Brexit scenario.

https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm8_e.htm

There is no boning or 'fucking over' as even before a trade deal, under WTO rules we'd still only be arguing the toss between what is on average 1% tariffs - of which  7 of the top 10 countries I linked as top trading partners with EU who only currently have WTO deals with the EU, pay, yet do handsomely when it comes to trade. 

Federalist championing federalism in the EU have even argued that if any country can't follow (specifically naming the UK as an example) that the EU should willingly give the a bespoke Associate Agreement trade deal.

They don't want to lose business just as much as nobody else wants to lose business - and their foundations are currently a lot  rockier....

       ""Those states, like the UK, which may decide 
        not to take the federal step forward can opt 
        for the status of associate membership."" 

http://www.spinelligroup.eu/article/fundamental-law-european-union

As it is Ukraine managed to negotiate a simple Association Agreement in 6 months whilst being locked in a civil war and being partly annexed by Russia.

The fear rhetoric about trade really does need to be put back in its box.  It's silly, but more importantly people need to be told the *actual* circumstances, what the reforms are (however great or small - I'm suspecting the latter), and the choice between *Trade With The EU* versus *Ever Closer Union With The EU*.

There were a large number of people who committed suicide by jumping from the bridge into the Dene below. I don’t know the exact number as reports vary but it would be between 150 and 200. There were also numerous accounts of potential suicides being prevented by policemen, cab drivers and other passers by.  In 1912 the extra layer of stone was laid plus the 2 inch high metal ornamentation on top. Even though there were newspaper reports of children in the Eton Terrace Pleasure Gardens being traumatised at the sight of people falling to their deaths on the rocks below there was actually people who complained that raising the parapet wall would ruin their view of the valley.

This simple strategy actually worked as the number of suicides after 1912 dropped dramatically.

You are left with a society that doesn't care about the poor because it's internalised them as an ""other"" consisting of scroungers, criminals, cheats and so on, thereby letting the government cut welfare with impunity.

As Mhairi Black said earlier on, it's a fucking disgrace that we have to have food banks in this country, and even worse that as one of the richest per-capita countries in the world anywhere up to 1 million people (and likely more) use them.

But as long as we have a way of negatively separating the average person from these people in need the former will continue to support measures against the latter. The number of food banks increased quicker from 2010-2015 than it did from 2007-2010, and we are supposedly ""in recovery"". 350,000 people used a food bank in 2012, and over 1m last year.

The UK is a backward mess in these regards.  We've got modern measures tacked onto ancient stuff but there's this pervading attitude that because it's all somehow still ticking along that it's obviously the best system of government ever known to man and how dare you question it.

We're bad at this as a nation, we never really look at what everyone else is doing and I think EVEL is evidence of that.  Nowhere else would consider that a suitable fix, the obvious solution is an English parliament.  If every other constituent nation has its own parliament then England requires one also, never mind that it might be difficult or expensive or any other excuse, it's doable and should have been done already.

It might be too late though, a federal UK has been the obvious solution to keeping people mostly happy for a long time but once again the backwards mentality of Westminster deliberately delayed devolution efforts for a very long time.

When it comes to mental health there are levels. If someone has capacity and is in a prison not a mental health facility then as far as I am concerned that's that. 
I wouldn't rate depression due to being in prison as being on par with full paranoid  schizophrenia. Its like treating a cold as if it's cancer there are levels.

If there is a suicide risk there are measures that can and are taken like I explained above.

I'm not saying that depression and suicide should be encouraged. I'm saying that prisoners should be expected to be unhappy.

When it comes to murderers I don't agree with rehabilitation as being as important. That's a final line that was crossed and when released in by concerned of they are happy or not. That's the price you pay for murder, your life is ruined. If reoffending is an issue they shouldn't be released.

It is a Solicitors job to ensure that their client obtains Good Title to their property, as such no solicitor should allow their client pay real money for a property which doesn't fulfil this.

I will just preface, I don't hunt myself, but know people who take part, or are involved in other ways. I'm in the interesting position of seeing the horse and hunt world from close(ish) up, while not being involved or invested myself.

The biggest point is that foxes, in the countryside, are a pest. Without natural predators their numbers need to be managed. There are 3 ways of doing this, trapping, poisoning or hunting. Trapping can easily leave a fox trapped for days before it dies or is killed, and poisoning is really not a pleasant way to go, for any animal. That leaves hunting as the most humane method. At this point there are 2 methods, shooting or dogs. Shooting is the simpler, but has the disadvantage of time and effort for the farmer (or they have to pay someone). Also it is easy to only clip a Fox and have it escape, only to die slowly. Dogs have 2 main advantages, one it is reliably quick, either the fox dies fast, or it escapes. This leads to the 2nd, a fit fox often escapes. The foxes that are run down are often the weaker ones. These are also the ones that often cause problems (attacking chickens, raiding homes etc), since they struggle with rabbits etc.

At this point we could just have a pack of dogs and let them run the fox down. This costs money to maintain though and it is cheaper for the farmers to just put down some poison and be done with it. Also you need a some way of keeping up with the dogs to control them. A four by four can't handle a rough field, and a quadbike can't get past fences. A horse on the other hand can handle both with ease.

Even better, there are a bunch of people who, not only don't want paying for dealing with foxes, but will pay for the privilege! They all gather and get to charge around socialise and exercise their horses, while the farmer has less problems with foxes and an extra source of income. Even better, it becomes in the farmer's interest to tolerate the foxes and even set aside ground for their sets etc. This also provides habitat for other species that otherwise would have nowhere to hide, nest and live. Vastly improving the English countryside.

As for why the riders do it. It's a goal and a challenge. Most riders are lucky to catch site of the dogs, let alone the Fox. They just want an excuse to charge around on their horse and meet like-minded people. The crowd seems to be split roughly into the toffs, who many people recognise and the enthusiasts, who don't have money but love horses and riding. Everything else is pomp and ceremony (most serves a purpose, but it takes a while to figure out what).
As for the fox, 90% of the time, it escapes. Most hunters and hunts co sided it fair play and a win to the Fox when it manages to go to ground. The few who dig up the fox really need their shoves stuck somewhere painful, and most riders would agree.",null,0,null,1436922067,null,0,false,0,ct3mp5e,null,t3_3d8mq9,null,t1_ct3mp5e,null,t1_ct2s875,null,null,null,1437859558,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The idea was to give the impression that the Doctor always was and is. But as the timeline has come together, it's clear that after regenerating, 9 goes on a sort of post-regeneration mania, similar to 3, 6, 8, 11 and 12 where they have almost a burst of energy about them in their post regeneration state(as opposed to sleeping) and an unpredictableness to their actions. As such, 9 has had some adventures, but its almost as if he landed, did stuff then ran away without rest or sleep. That's why when he finally takes the time to look in the mirror in Rose, he's amazed. I like to imagine that Nine's prerose life was a man running away from himself, every second focusing on the next adventure so thoroughly that he hasn't taken the time to look in the mirror for fear of seeing the war doctor.
