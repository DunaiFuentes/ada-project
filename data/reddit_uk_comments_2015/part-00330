And yes there is a feasible solution to the two party system, significant voting reform. This would lead to a multiparty state. 

As for the state of current politicians, its easy to think that if you don't, well, think about it. A cabinet minister in this country earns about £150,000 a year. For someone of their education, they could easily be earning ten times that in industry. Politicians are not money obsessed. They are in politics because they actually want to change the country, it's just that you don't agree with their policies. The UK is one of the least corrupt countries in the world. It's really easy to peddle the government as evil but if you actually decide to accept them as human and mistaken, you'll find yourself thinking a lot more rationally about this. 

Take Theresa May. I hate her policies and her ideals. I hate her character and almost all of her decisions. But I will not for one second accuse her of doing it for money. She genuinely believes her archaic strategy is the best way to go. Well either that or she thinks it will win votes (which it may do). But that certainly won't be solved by a direct democracy.

Inter today also met with Lamela's agent and father: they reached an agreement on the wages which could be a significant development. Tottenham was offered €6 million for a loan with a €14 million forced option to buy. Milan had also contacted Lamela's entourage but at the moment it's just an idea.

You work for Exxon, and have a lot of ""friends"" there. You then move to Chevron one day, and now most of those folks fall into one of these 4 categories:

1. Some refuse to speak to you, or at most give you a courteous but fairly chilly reception when you see them next.
2. Some others call you up on occasion to tell you they're disappointed in you... essentially becoming your parents, I suppose.
3. Still others shout vile abuse at you when you next meet.
4. In some extreme cases, a bunch wait outside your new workplace and assault you or your vehicle as you drive out the parking lot, maybe even go so far as to shout death threats. Oh, and of course, perhaps fling decapitated farm animals (or their heads) at you. You know, for banter. Of the kind Don Corleone finds particularly amusing.

The way some fans behave says to me that footballers are not quite afforded some of the basic human rights the rest of us enjoy (or are ostensibly supposed to). Why? Because they're entertainers, Dara. Well, I suppose the money they make makes up for all of that, then.

Not questioning the role of passion and team-vs-team banter at all, I engage in my fair share; three of my closest friends support Arsenal, Spurs, and Man Utd, after all. I just think people take it too far at times.

Who cares if we have more money, they control the supply of what Chelsea wants.

That and Juventus does't need a lot of money to win Serie A, and potentially the Champions League at the moment. 

They get a boatload of money from TV rights in Italy, they're going to keep getting boatloads of money from winning competitions, and they can drive up the price of Pogba to to something astronomical or something that's flat out prohibitive. 

Again, teams you would expect to be contending in Serie A are in flames right now - Genoa hasn't won the league in almost a century and they finished above Milan and Inter last season. Juve could probably set their domestic squad to cruise control and win the league in March all while ensuring they're 100% for European matches.

Also has anyone considered that Pogba might like living in Italy? Or that he might like being a part of a club as big and as important as Juventus is in the greater landscape of global football. It's not like he's making chump change and toiling away at some midtable club in Modena waiting for an offer from a big club. He's making big money, at an equally big club, in Turin.

Correct, not the same one. Same family of compounds, they're similar but not the same - obviously, THC is psychoactive while CBD is not, among other differences. 

&gt; There's also indications it leads to schizophrenia...

Indeed. I'm not pro-legalisation myself, I'm in favour of decriminalisation though. Just because it's not as bad as some things doesn't mean we should be encouraging people to use it. High THC, low-CBD strains are particularly bad for potential psychotic symptoms, because there is also evidence that CBD counteracts the pro-psychotic effects of THC.

It's obvious that he loves the club like Lucas and Kuyt do, someone who we've adopted as our own. But when things go wrong for him, they go monumentally wrong. He's chasing down Carra's record for own goals, having played about half as many games. He's often quiet or unhelpful towards the other defenders. He can be slow to react, as well as slow in a sprint. He gets caught pulling shirts in the box. He can be clumsy. He's 30 now, so one wonders how many years of his prime he has left.

But sometimes, just sometimes, something in his head clicks and he has a game like monday night. He becomes this monster who seems to be everywhere at once, dispossessing pacy strikers cleanly, being an absolute boss in the air, scoring from set pieces, shouting orders at our players.

The worst part is that in my idealistic mind thought that this squad had enough young talent to compete for top 4 once everyone was developed enough. The golden generation of Everton youth could easily develop into a CL level side. 

Jags isn't getting any younger, and neither is Baines/Howard. I thought that Stones would take over for Jags once he retired with Galloway/Browning slotting into Jags old spot, Garbutt for Baines, and maybe get Ospina or someone on that level once Howard retires. 

There is a ton of promising talent at Everton right now, and letting Stones go is showing the entire EPL that we have no ambition to compete for CL.

&gt;A response to the Government's refusal to debate cannabis reforms.

As others have pointed out, so far atleast they haven't refused to debate anything. They have issued a statement, and are considering whether there is any need to have a debate on it.

&gt;The response, despite the popular interest from it's electorate, was a resounding 'No.'

The only *popular interest* that matters is that of the electorate during the electorate. Weather it should be like that is a completely different matter, but the fact of the matter is that the Tories were voted in to represent people's views. The wishes of 11,300,109 trumps that of 200,000.

&gt;To put thing in perspective, this news comes the day after The US Government admits cannabis kills cancer cells.

Granting licenses for medicinal drugs is completely different from legalising recreational Hemp.

&gt;Crime rates there have dropped, usage amongst teens has gone

Correlation doesn't indicate a cause.[However, if we are accepting this type of shody evidence ](http://www.nber.org/digest/oct14/w20085.html)

&gt;schools have reaped a windfall in tax profits

As unlikely as it seems, this filthy Tory scumbag believes in putting lives before profit. 

&gt;A recent study concluded it was 114 times less deadly than alcohol.

Call me ignorant, but I'm not even sure how that works. A glass of beer is not going to kill me. [And the positive and negative effects are not nearly as clear as you make them out to be](http://www.medicaldaily.com/marijuana-vs-alcohol-effects-psychoactive-drugs-have-physical-and-mental-health-332094).

&gt; Not even the chief crime commissioner of Durham

Oh, well, if the Chief Crime Commissioner of *Durham* thinks your right, then I've got to be wrong! Silly me!

&gt;After all, if drugs are as dangerous and corrupting on the mind as they suggest, then I'm sure they'd understand we wouldn't want some crazed, drug-and-alcohol fuelled irrational making important decisions that affect all of us. 

The edge is real. But to be fair, actually screening MPs for Drugs isn't a terrible idea, so I'll give you that.

&gt;They have given us the tools to hoist them by their own petard.

Or they could genuinely care about the people they represent? Oh, but isn't nearly interesting enough.

&gt;This is civil disobedience, my lovelies.

No, it isn't. Signing a petition is not civil disobedience. We live is a relatively free country, where you can say pretty much whatever you like. Civil Disobedience is defined as:

    the refusal to comply with certain laws considered unjust, as a peaceful form of political protest.

i.e Breaking the law. Unless you are encouraging people to go and and take Weed anyway, then no civils are being disobedienced. Just because it sound cool doesn't mean it is correct...

&gt;and if you find yourself feeling sorry for the poor MPs, just remember how corrupt UK Politics is in 2015

3. Plenty of museums, galleries and tourist attractions throughout the year. Small arts/comedy event during August but pretty sure it'll grow!

4. I can never understand what the true definition of 'underground' or 'techno' is but find that they are distinguished largely by 'Shit' and 'Not shit' so I would advise you to focus on Sneaky Pete's, La Belle Angele, Liquid Rooms and Caberet Voltaire for that scene - everywhere else seems to cater to the masses which generic house/hippityhop/commercial.  Throughout the week the venues I listed will do similar to catch the student crowds excepting Sneaky Pete's.

5. Expensive bikes can be a target but a good chain to solid fixtures will go a long way, typically find that no one will let thieves tamper in a busy area.  Cycling is popular enough but prepare yourself as if you were attacking the mountain stages of the Tour de France, Edinburgh can be hilly and the cobbles may be slippy.

6. If you're getting food from a chippy, 'sauce' is a rubbish brown ketchup thinned out with vinegar, wouldn't bother. And avoid Grant Management when it comes to renting a flat.

The Doctor: Between you and me, in a hundred words, where do you think Van Gogh rates in the history of art?

Curator: Well... um... big question, but, to me Van Gogh is the finest painter of them all. Certainly the most popular, great painter of all time. The most beloved, his command of colour most magnificent. He transformed the pain of his tormented life into ecstatic beauty. Pain is easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world, no one had ever done it before. Perhaps no one ever will again. To my mind, that strange, wild man who roamed the fields of Provence was not only the world's greatest artist, but also one of the greatest men who ever lived.

Vincent and the Doctor is my favorite episode just because in the end you (especially after this) you realize that Vincent probably never realized how much joy he'd bring to the whole world through his gift.

That explosion scattered those elements across the desolations of deep space. After so, so many millions of years these elements came together to form new stars and new planets.

I like that Romeu gets stuck in and he suits the anchor role really well. Wanyama really puts himself about in midfield, but he just doesn't have the excellent, well rounded skill set that Morgan did and it shows, not that its a knock on the effort he's shown this season.

Not sold on Cedric what-so-ever, he seems to run up and down like a bit of a headless chicken. He's fast, not afraid to run at the defence or have a shot from anywhere, but his defending is MIA and his crossing is really poor, has a bad habit of pulling people down when they are going past him as well.

Bearing in mind that the current biggest threat to the UK comes from anti UK Muslims, from inside and outside the uk. I can see your point, as those stories frequently lead the news.

Anti Semitism is on the rise in the UK, much of the problem isn't from black or white British, but from the growing Muslim community. 

There are few anti UK Jewish stories, so the negative Jewish news stories don't occur frequently, which probably helps your argument, because there is so little coverage of Jewish news stories that aren't from an anti Semitic regard.

I was working in a sports bar and was quickly becoming a fan of football, (soccer here in the states). He would come in and ask if we could put the Toffees on for him whenever he came to watch. His passion and fervor for this team was magnetic. I hadn't ever seen love for a sports team like this in my life. We quickly became friends, more than friends, we are basically brothers. At the end of the summer he looked at me and said, ""Bobby, you're a blue now. It's in you, you're part of a family."" And he gave me his white 2003 kit (which I still own and wear). 

I feel, even though I'm American and haven't ever been to Liverpool, that I am a part of something. Something bigger than me. I am part of a family, a family that supports each other. Even when times are hard. Especially when times are hard. And at the end of the day we are Blues and the rest doesn't matter.

Not saying he's not a talent; he certainly is. But he also had a helping hand.

Besides, it seems one of our team's largest issues is a lack of maturity and composure, and Poch and Levy are targeting a very specific type of player; young talents who are interested in playing UCL in the near future, but aren't quite there yet. Do you really think the addition of that type of player is going to take us to the next level this current season? What we really need is a veteran 'general' at CM, Modric would honestly be perfect.

The Doctor told the staffer that she looked tired, he thinks ""wow, she does doesn't she"" and repeats the message to his colleague. Eventually the idea spirals out of control and everyone comes to the realisation that she looks weak, tired and overwhelmed. 

And then someone stages a coup for leadership.

A survey by YouGov found that 32% of people support legalisation as compared 49% against. But the really interesting part of this for me is the fact that when they rephrased the question and reminded people that you can tax it if it's legalised, the numbers suddenly become closer at 40/46. What this says to me is that most people are pretty uninformed about the subject and are merely repeating the line the government has pushed for years. The fact that people wouldn't even think about the benefit of taxation when replying to the initial question speaks volumes. The government has historically kept any debate about the issue stifled and blinkered down the path of their favoured opinion, so realistically the fact that 1 in 3 still support legalisation after decades of biased mantra is  telling, and the fact that many more are willing to change their minds when the slightest bit of extra information is given to them says even more.

They have a less cult following compared to SV and Honda etc., don't go for an old Divvy, they are worse than a bandit and getting really long in the tooth unless you find a 900, those are decent bikes compared to 600 divvys and will serve for longer.

Also you can have a peek at a faired K75 or a Honda Dullville, both superb commuting bikes but you are unlikely to find even an old Dullville that cheap. If you are willing to risk an old bike, you can get very good deals, I got my K1100LT for around that amount and it is a superb winter commuting bike, rain just doesn't touch me as long as I am moving and the engine is indestructible. You can get a very old and ratty Pan Euro if you are lucky, esp since the biking season is drawing to a close with the rains and all summer and weekend warriors will start thinking about selling soon, although probably you will have to replace the cans at one point since they tend to rot and that is one of the selling points and they are not cheap.

For winter riding consider a properly faired bike, it makes a massive difference.

edit: one more thing about Bandits, since they are dime a dozen, they are virtually theft-proof.

What everyone fears and criticises and calls the 'threat' is terrorism that is motivated by an extremist and violence-based interpretation of Islam. And that is because there have been real terror attacks in the UK, let alone abroad.

As for Judaism, I think the media are very critical of Israel's actions in Palestine. As others have said, there is no real anti-UK feeling from UK Jews.

I think the picture you are getting from your TV shows is not rounded. We just want UK Muslims to be good citizens, like everyone wants from UK Jews, or UK atheists. We want our Muslims to be like Moeen Ali or Mo Farah, (or at a push, Shahid Malik) not the 7/7 bombers. The Muslim threat means Muslims turning anti-UK, not the UK turning anti-Muslim.

That said though...Pogba is much more ready to step into the starting XI right now, in my opinion. And while I don't think the Fabregas-Matic pivot is as dire as some think, I wouldn't mind an immediate impact player for our starting XI that can also be a long term fixture as well.

Personally, I dislike it. It victimises and dis-empowers women whilst at the same time fails to tackle the real issue - the nutjobs who think it's okay to sexually assault anyone. Women who choose not to travel in these carriages could be perceived as 'asking for it' in these mental people's minds. It'd be better to put effort towards stopping the people who sexually assault rather than making woman out to be these weak and vulnerable victims who need all this special protection. This would benefit more people at it would tackle sexual assault against all genders/race/sexual orientation, whilst being more empowering to women.

Is it a bit harder? Yes definitely - but it's a better, more sustainable solution.  

I don't think Corbyn  is bad for thinking up this by the way, it's just an idea - and it's good to see he wants to reduce the number of sexual assaults.

What has Townsend ever contributed to this side, in years, at ANY stage of his career, bar a single flukey goal and trying to be Bale and failing miserably? He only ever looks mediocre when he plays for England, and that's a compliment. Comparing Erik Lamela (River/Roma/Tottenham) to Townsend at any club is hilarious. Even Lamela has better stats goals and assists wise than Townsend, in one injured first full season to adapt and last year. I know stats aren't everything but...no. Sorry man. 

&gt;Somebody here said it well: Lamela at his best is irrelevant, at worst he's a turnover machine.

Yet he went from being touted as top 10 in the world prospect wise by respected journalists, and the heir to Totti at Roma, to that from some guys on /r/soccer and /r/coys.

&gt;I LOVE Mousa Dembele. THAT is a skillful footballer. He should be one of the first names on the team sheet, and I am more than happy with him on the right, Chadli on the left and Eriksen behind Kane. Coincidentally, Pochettino seems to agree with me.

Same way you can't ignore that Balotelli was in no way someone Brendan wanted unless given a choice between him and Eto'o (so undoubtedly a committee-driven signing). 

I guess what I'm saying is what the real ITKs are saying, which is that FSG have given Brendan much more autonomy this year over transfers and staff. Notable difference from last year. If you can blame him for anything, it's for not putting up target options for the committee last summer as firmly as he did this year with Benteke/Clyne, and for allowing the club to spend 20m+ on players he didn't particularly want (Markovic etc.).

&gt;Working together
Call regional summits of local authorities, universities, transport authorities, police, women’s organisations and campaigns to stop street harassment to discuss practical steps that will tackle this.

&gt;Elected representatives
Encourage local authorities to appoint cabinet positions for women’s safety.
Create a ministerial role for women’s safety.

&gt;Police hotline
Sexual assault and harassment - such as being followed, groped, and public exposure is under reported. Many women feel intimidated, violated, too upset and worried that they will not be taken seriously by the police. I would look into setting up a hotline, which is run by police but dedicated to reporting harassment and assault.

&gt;This would be staffed 24/7 by women, and to which women could text or call to report with the confidence that they will not be dismissed. If a home visit is needed for a statement, this should also be done by women.

There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, and the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream; people made of smoke and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace. We've got work to do.

I think in policy areas where you don't have that much knowledge or personal experience it's generally a good idea to talk to those that do. An 'all white' group debating how to fix racism without ever including the voices of any people of other ethnicities would rightly be laughed at. 

Anyway, saying that you think a broader issue is worth looking at is not the same as 'backing' it. If I said I've heard interesting things about three of the runners in the grand national, but wanted to read up on them some more before placing a bet, it would seem a bit weird for someone to describe me immediately as 'backing' one of those runners.

Previously, when burglars were caught and admitted additional crimes those were also counted as detected (known as 'taken into consideration' or TIC). The Met no longer count those additional crimes as detected unless there is actual evidence (rather than someone just saying 'I did that one too'), which is a more 'honest' way of measurement but obviously it looks bad because it's apples vs oranges. This doesn't mean that the individuals that go out and do these crimes haven't been caught, but is there a justification in continuing to spend limited resources on investigating when the burglary has stopped at the same time that a prolific offender has been jailed? For what it's worth, burglary has gone down in the last five years, both nationally and within the Met - though there are probably loads of reasons for this, as crime recording (and crime itself!) is a surprisingly complex beast.

Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

&gt;CJ383 Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. More supported accommodation should be provided for women on release to break the cycle of repeat offending and custody.

null,null,DanArlington,null,null,null,"&gt;Besiktas believe that they have reached an agreement with Manchester United to sign Víctor Valdés, the goalkeeper who fell out of favour with Louis van Gaal. Valdés has been offered a two-year deal with the option of a third season, although there is no suggestion yet on whether he wants to move to the Turkish club. Senol Gunes, the Besiktas coach, initially resisted the arrival of Valdés as he would replace his present goalkeepers.

&gt;● West Bromwich Albion have turned down Tottenham Hotspur’s latest offer for Saido Berahino, worth about £21 million, and there are suggestions that they have increased their valuation of the striker from £25 million to £30 million. The West Midlands club, who have admitted that Berahino could depart, hope to resurrect a deal for Federico Fazio.They could not agree on a relegation clause in the proposed contract with the Tottenham defender last week. However, Everton have made a bid to sign Fazio, while West Brom want Jonny Evans, also a defender, from Manchester United. Everton deny having an interest in him.

&gt;Tottenham are only interested in selling Érik Lamela, despite Inter Milan’s interest in taking the Argentina midfielder, who cost an initial £26 million two seasons ago, on loan. Milos Veljkovic, the Tottenham defender, has joined Sporting Gijon on loan.

&gt;● West Ham United have postponed Modibo Maïga’s planned move to Al Nassr, the Saudi Arabian club, until after their match against Liverpool on Saturday. Maïga could be the club’s only fit striker, with Diafra Sakho rated 50-50 after a groin injury. Simone Zaza, the 24-year-old striker, is expected to turn down a move to West Ham from Juventus, who agreed a loan deal. West Ham want to sign a striker shortly and are hopeful of tying up a deal for Emmanuel Adebayor, from Tottenham.

&gt;Jason Denayer, the Manchester City defender, held talks with Marseilles last night after a proposed loan move to Galatasaray appeared to fall through because the Turkish club were unable to reach an agreement on a buyout clause. Sunderland are also interested in Denayer.

&gt;● Wolverhampton Wanderers are expected to reject Norwich City’s improved offer for Benik Afobe, believed to be in the region of £8 million.The 22-year-old scored 14 goals in 23 league games last season.

&gt;Watford are in talks to sign Abdoulaye Doucouré, the Rennes and France Under-21 midfielder.

2. Edinburgh is super safe ... Mostly just junkies, and the occasional sexual assault on the Meadows (our big park) but I have only heard of two instances in 4 year. I'm a woman and I walk home alone often and generally get no hassle. Honestly getting a flat anywhere is fine - Leith tends to be a cheaper option and has more of a reputation for being dodgy compared to the old and new towns but it's seriously perfectly fine, not seen much trouble there at all, or anywhere for that matter.

3. yes Edinburgh is super artsy. I'd say that's one of its defining features. Nice galleries, art classes and museums. Check out Jupiter Artland online.

4. if you want a proper night out go to sub club in Glasgow. Edinburgh is alright for going out but there doesn't seem to be much variation. That being said, there's a night called Body on every once and a while at Henry's cellar on Lothian rd that does proper techno! Otherwise sneaky Petes and bongo usually. Also, mind the 3 am license. There are better bars and pubs than clubs. Never go to the Hive.

5. your bike may get stolen - don't leave it out over night. Loads of my friends got their bikes nicked. One of them got the tyres slashed and seat stolen. People will fucking wreck your shit so just avoid leave your bike unattended as much as possible.

6. Edinburgh is a great city, a great pace of life with so much different shit to do. It's way nicer than Birmingham I promise.

&gt;Because I care about the exploitation of the poor by the rich? 

Have you not noticed how this disproportionately affects women? For example, 70% of people in national minimum wage jobs are women, and on average they are paid 19% less (not for the same work as men - it's just a brute fact than the average woman will earn less than the average man, and as such be more likely to be poor). Public sector cuts hit them harder because they make up 2/3 of the public sector workforce. Benefits and tax credits make up on average 20% of women's incomes compared to 10% for men, so cuts to these affect them more too. They do the significant majority of unpaid care and domestic work.

This is before we even start talking about their under-representation in politics, media, and positions of power, social attitudes towards women, and so on.

It would be rare for Pellegrini to have to say much at half time anyway. The players would have been briefed in the week before what is required of them and because of that, MP would, hopefully, only have to address one or two individuals who needed reminding of their role. The whole squad should know exactly what is expected of them. A language barrier wouldn't be too much of an issue.

In the case of a complete thrashing where, at halftime, things needed to change, the whole coaching staff would be informed of the change and each given a group to explain to, for example: defenders, midfielders and attackers. Maybe even divided into native languages and explained that way.

Senior players act as a voice too. While MP has a 'style' of football, the ultimate goal is to feed Aguero, so he'll be able to speak to a player on what he wants them to do and vice versa. I imagine the likes of Kompany, Zabaleta and Yaya have quite the say at half time as well and those are all bilingual players.

I've always thought the half time team talk is overstated in importance within international dressing rooms. Half time isn't for tweaks or substitutions and for the team to talk to each other in comfort. It's so rare and generally ineffective for a complete tactical overhaul, especially one that hasn't been pre discussed, so language shouldn't be a hindrance at all.

Hope that's a helpful explanation.

However, be very aware that he may not be ready to do so, and I think you need to go at his speed. It is possible that the memories of the incident have been suppressed, and his making an effort to recall the details will be a painful experience (which he may be terrified of). Alcohol/drugs can have the effect of connecting to the subconscious mind, which is when suppressed memories can temporarily resurface.

It is possible that one good course of action is for your friend to get professional counselling help (even if the sexual assault allegation is not true, it sounds like the anger issues etc need to be dealt with). There isn't much counselling available in the UK free of charge, but if he is willing to then approaching a GP is a good start. The NHS offers short periods of CBT - which may not be long enough to dig into complex childhood abuse issues but may be a good start. Counselling is also available outside of the NHS, which is certainly worth considering.

It sounds like your friend's family have been protecting him from the knowledge that his sister may have been assaulted also. Perhaps they (she) need to tackle this head-on and have a one-to-one discussion? It will be difficult to talk about but secrets can have their own corrosive effect. Knowing that other people have been through a similar trauma can be helpful.

It is possible that by taking one of these prior options (counselling, family honesty) that your friend may feel able to go to the police at a later time.

1. What they have heard from other people about an issue and

2. How much they have thought about it themselves (usually based on 1).

Most Mp's won't have thought that much about drugs policy, it's the kind of thing you just accept what people tell you. But when you do start to think about it it's obvious that the current system is ridiculous (prisons are full of drugs FFS) and needs to be changed. So I think getting them to engage in this thought process is a good thing.

Moreover you are blocking them from saying ""all my constituents think ..."" as you have proven to them that there is dissent in the area.

ITT there is a lot of negativity, ""oh there's no point in saying anything because my MP already thinks something about this issue,"" but the problem with this is you aren't offering them the chance to change. Ironically it is not that helpful to write to your MP on things they agree with you about, but offering them the chance to reconsider is a really great thing to do.

Tell them the truth, it has a great effect, it will corrode their ignorance over time.

Well, the DM hacks would know all about that.

&gt; Some 48 families who took part had said they wanted the £145.50 annual licence fee cut or axed.

And afterwards, 33 of the 48 changed their minds and decided the BBC was worth paying for.

&gt; Ukip MP Douglas Carswell called the experiment ‘flawed’, adding: ‘No one wants to prevent people from watching BBC programmes. This is about how we pay for them. 

Douglas Carswell said: ‘Here is a straw man. Look at me attacking the straw man.’  
The [report of the study](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/reports/pdf/lifewithoutthebbc.pdf) (PDF) declares in its introduction:  
&gt; The BBC commissioned this study in order to help it understand better the value that it delivers to UK households in return for the licence fee and how this could be improved.

But that would be harder for Carswell to argue against.  
From the executive summary:

&gt; This piece of research was designed to gain new insight into what value audiences place in the services and programming currently provided by the  BBC,  and  to  consider how households would react  if  they  were  unable  to  access  BBC services. Given the number of other channels and services available, how distinctive would they 
find  the  BBC’s  content  and  how  easily  would  those  households  be  able  to  find  suitable alternatives?
What was the impact on their view of the value for money of the licence fee?

I'm not disagreeing that in an ideal world nobody would do drugs. But whether you like it or not, casual drug taking **is** normalised. How many people *need* their cup of coffee to wake up in the morning? How many people go out drinking as a way to have fun and relax? How many people couldn't get through the day without a 20 deck of smokes? What about that nightcap of whiskey to send you off to the land of nod?

Casual drug taking is normalised. What we need to focus on is harm reduction amongst those people that do take drugs - and prohibition is not a harm reduction technique, quite the opposite.

I strongly disagree with this, though:
&gt;What troubles me is this... Why do people want it legalised? Why do they want to get high? Are these people's lives so devoid of meaning or happiness that inhaling these fumes is an important outlet for them? Forget about drugs and all that crap, just enjoy life.

* Your scheme may be exempt due to recent changes: see https://small-firms.fca.org.uk/instalment-credit-agreements-consumer-credit-firms  This relies on you not charging any fees or interest on the hire, and still limits you to 12 months. This is probably your best bet - but you will need to seek proper legal advice since this may require some restructuring of your scheme.

* Agreements made by charities are exempt from regulation [CCA Part II, s.16](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/39/part/II) Is the university and/or your rental scheme a charity?

* CCA doesn't apply to agreeements for less than £50  - s.17(1)(b). (Note, multiple 'small agreements' will be counted as one big single agreement if it looks like it was done purely to avoid the CCA regs). don't know if this is anywhere close to your rates?

Hope these offer some ideas on where to go next - you will need some legal support though!

But better players could have had a bad game and gone through, we currently have to be playing at our best to achieve our best, which most agree is only reaching the group stage. OP is right in the sense that we are chronically underinvesting look at this:


Year | Amount Spent on Players | Amount Sold on Players | Profit made on Players | Profit made as a Club
----|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------
2015/2016 | £3.38m | £1.96m | -£1.4m | Ongoing
2014/2015 | £1.77m | £9.8m | £8m | Unannounced
2013/2014 | £9.21m | £19.04m | £9.8m | £11.7m
2012/2013 | £2.09m | £5.12m | £3m | £10.3m
2011/2012 | £2.78m | £1.22m | -£1.5m | -£7.37m
2010/2011 | £8.53m | £14.41m | £6m | £0.1m
Total | £27.76m | £51.55m | £23.79 | £14.73

If Van Dijk is sold this year's spending will roughly match the pattern of underinvesting again.

Alasdair Lamont estimates that missing out on Champions League will have cost us £13m. Doing so 2 years in a row will have cost us £26m. Looking at these figures and knowing that would buying a £5m player (more money than we've spent on a player since 2001, Big John Hartson) and another £3m-£4m pound player capable of making our entry to the group stages easier not have been a wise investment? Both years 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 we would have made £7.3m profit and £6.7m profit respectively and might have made a £13m increase to our 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 profits. Had the gamble not paid off we still wouldn't have lost money in those years and would have increased our squad strength significantly worst case scenario, best case scenario we would have recouped their cost and another £18m. Now we're in a position where we have lost the Champions league money (which was key to profits in 2013/2014 and 2012/2013) and don't have the players that we might have had who can help change that next season, we're only going to sell Van Dijk and bring in a half price replacement to say £2.5m and then lose out on £13 again next year. We all agree we're not that far off so why not take the steps needed to go the distance to our goal when it's worth so much to us. We're frittering away £20's for the sake of £10's you can't convince me that's a good strategy.

Edit: TL;DR You can't expect to replace the players you sell for half the price forever and always have the scouts get it right. We really need the champions league money and are missing out on it to recoup much smaller amounts on individual players.",null,0,null,1440582178,null,null,1440582629,0,cug3bhc,null,t3_3idoqh,null,null,null,t3_3idoqh,null,null,null,1441504976,null,3,null,CelticFC,t5_2snki,3,null

1. He did show good signs of showing for the ball for a quick 1-2 and then spinning his defender best shown when played a 1-2 with Zaha in the box which saw Zaha through on goal and bundled down for a penalty. 
2. Sadly though at one point in the second half he had the ball in space on the edge of the box and passed it to Gayle on the wing, he looked torn between being unselfish and naturally wanting to have a go.

GCHQ do not. Our government's oversight of the use of this data by certain departments is a joke. This is what the article is saying. The ISC only found out about some GCHQ / MI operations because of the Snowden leaks. Their interface to the intelligence community had been very sparse with the truth. The government set up an inquiry which publicly whitewashed it but internal documents show the inquiry raked them over the coals trying to find out wtf was actually going on.

I'm very pro-privacy and that kind of thing but I don't have a problem with it as long as *justice is seen to be done*.

I think the US FISA approach is even worse than ours because they give the illusion of due process but are just kangroo courts.

I do have a problem with the number of departments that could request information under RIPA but that's a separate issue.

Like alcohol, cannabis can be abused. However, after abusing cannabis for several years, sudden cessation without medical help won't kill you.

I have a brand new GSkill RipJaws bought from NewEgg sometime in June. I've never used it and I got my hands on another set so this one is surplus to requirements.  [Timestamp here](http://imgur.com/EPj3o19) I have the proof of purchase but 

- It's from NewEgg USA
- It comes with the invoices of my other parts
- I can make a photocopy of it if you want one.

I'm looking for £215 posted or I'm willing to make a part exchange with cash coming your way for a 4K Monitor or Ultrawide 3440 x 1440.

null,null,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Fabians | Unite,null,"&gt;I don't agree that society is inherently sexist towards women.

It's not a matter of opinion. For example, men interrupt women more than they interrupt men (or women interrupt women). This means men control conversations. This in turn means that even if you legislate everything to be 50-50 (local councils, Cabinets, boardrooms, etc.), men still control the discourse in those situations. This is the reason that most of our internal rules regarding All-Women Shortlists have a rule that it must be *at least* 50% women, because simply having it 50-50 still leads to the disparity I've referred to.

Additionally, if you take a situation where there's an obvious social power imbalance (patient-doctor, employer-employee) and the man is the one with the least social power, they *still* interrupt women more. So, solving social imbalances doesn't actually help women in this regard.

What's still worse about that stat is that men don't realise that they do it. In other words, they talk over women not because they actively think women should shut up, but because they simply don't, on some level, recognise women's voices as being important. This suggests a whole other level of subconscious prejudice that is in itself obviously problematic. Because the prejudice is subconscious, it's not enough to simply say, 'Look, women can [do whatever] if they want, why bother with AWS?' because when you see a bunch of men and women talking, you subconsciously give more weight to the men's statements. That's why in the Labour Party we structure things to give women an extra advantage.

null,null,weareapandanow,null,null,null,"I'm going to echo everyone else and say there is no filler/it's really worth watching the whole thing, but here's my take
on it. 

**William Hartnell:**

* An Unearthly Child (First story! Watch 1st episode only- you can skip the 100,000 BC bits)

* The Daleks (obvious)

* The Aztecs (best historical IMO)

* The Dalek Invasion of Earth (departure of first companion, also pretty iconic)

* The Time Meddler (introduces Meddling Monk- first 'other' timelord)

* The Daleks' Master Plan (skip episode 7, which is a rubbish Christmas special. Some other episodes might be
considered filler, but the story as a whole is fantastic even as recons)

* The Tenth Planet (introduction of Cybermen, 1st Doctor's death)


**Patrick Troughton:**

* Power of the Daleks (Troughton's first episode)

* The Web of Fear (just really good, introduces Brigadier)

* The Invasion (just a really good Cybermen story, introduces UNIT)

* The War Games (introduction of Time Lords, death of 2nd Doctor)


**Jon Pertwee:**

* Spearhead from Space (Pertwee's first episode, introduces UNIT base and Autons)

* Doctor Who and the Silurians (Silurians, obviously)

* Terror of the Autons (introduces the Master)

* The Time Warrior (introduces Sarah Jane, Sontarans, the word 'Gallifrey')

* Planet of the Spiders (only if you want 3rd Doctor's regeneration)


**Tom Baker**

* The Ark in Space (2nd TB episode, but better for getting a feel for him)

* Genesis of the Daleks (Dalek origin story, all round amazing)

* Pyramids of Mars (just because it's fun)

* The Deadly Assassin (Timelord shiz, only story without a companion)

* The Robots of Death/Talons of Weng Chiang/Horror of Fang Rock (these are all great stories and I insist you watch at least one Leela story)

* City of Death (often considered best story ever, plus you need Romana in your life)

* Logopolis (if you want 4th Doctor's regeneration)


**Peter Davison**

* Earthshock (cybermen, twist at the end probably everyone knows about but still fantastic)

* The Five Doctors (just because)

* The Caves of Androzani (another often considered best story ever, also Five's regeneration)


**Colin Baker**

If you must, Vengeance on Varos or Revelation of the Daleks are probably CB's best.

**Sylvester McCoy**

* Remembrance of the Daleks (daleks can go up stairs!)

* The Curse of Fenric (just a great story)

I've skipped out episodes that are just 'introducing companions', because we'd be here all day otherwise. I've probably missed some stuff, but I think that's the bare bones. Feel free to add to this anyone!

I don't think it's 8/9 million we're talking about, we're probably close, maybe negotiating about £3-4m, which TBF is a lot of money. Just like with Fernandinho, the final straw that made the transfer happen was him giving out on £4m.

Three's network coverage (and internet connectivity) is decent but not nearly as good as EE. Three works well in cities, but even then doesn't do as well indoors (at least in Oxford). Out in the countryside, it is definitely less reliable with less coverage. I take 3 hour train journeys up North very frequently and I definitely noticed getting much less connectivity on Three than on EE, to the point where I just turn off data while I'm on the train as it just drains battery trying to search for a signal.

That said, I repeat that I recommend Three 100% over EE. The price difference is just huge for the same allowances.

In Japan it's done for reasons of sexual harassment - which I would vouch is a more prevalent issue in Japanese society than in the UK. In Tokyo I'm slightly torn on their implementation - they only run during rush hour which prevents women from being easily harassed in packed carriages, and I am sure that many women feel safer for the use of them. 

However, what I don't like is that they fail to address the crux of the problem and only paper over the cracks. In addition to these carriages - I feel that they really need to focus on their report system (I know friends who have been touched on the underground there, and have gone to the police only to be told ""we can't do anything"" because the person has already run off). 

So, in the UK - I really don't know. Like Corbyn says, I think it's a good idea to see if women really feel they would benefit from this system.

null,null,DearTereza,null,null,null,"This is all silly and won't get resolved, because the modern Labour party is too split between centrists and old-style left-wingers. It's nobody's fault and the constant insulting and infighting is damaging the party more and more, they're not even close to electable any more. The party needs to split or dissolve. The Corbynites, unions et all should have their Labour party. I don't share their opinions, but I defend their right to have them, and the Labour party probably is where those people should be.

The centrist Labour politicians, although I personally align more with them, I still feel ought to accept they'd be better off in a new centre-left party, and not trying to straddle this increasingly large chasm of ideology. There is nothing wrong with being centrist, but trying to do it under the Labour banner is just not practical anymore, as plenty of more left wing elements evidently want their party back and sharing ground is just hurting everyone.

Saying Corbyn et al are unelectable is just fine - lots of people outside the party evidently agree - but that doesn't mean they shouldn't have a platform. Whatever you think of Corbyn's policies, they're distinctly Labour. The centrist elements ought to have their own party. This will split the vote and make it hard for either party to compete electorally, but that's already the case due to the confused current party, so at least this offers some hope for the future.

The Conservatives face a similar ideological split, with fairly hard right wing and centrist elements. In time I can see them splitting too. The ideologically committed left and right wing elements of both parties are increasingly far from the centrists.

If someone is capable of taking my views seriously enough, works hard for me and represents my rights in governance, I wouldn't begrudge him/her a good salary to take home, because I recognize that part of what makes him/her agree with me, is that we are similar people with similar needs. We're all trying to get along and make our lives the better, no matter our income brackets.

Whether or not that is the status quo or how well they are doing at the moment is debatable certainly, but I don't mind that MPs are thinking about government as a career. It's when it's their SOLE purpose that I'd feel betrayed. Do some good work, and by all means reap the rewards.

Having no prior experience, I trawled Google and pulled a load of completed EQ assessments to review. Ultimately I chose to build my own pro-forma taking the best bits of all the examples. 

In short, an EQ assessment seeks to analyse a set of people (usually before a change - i.e. restructure, redundancy, new policy) and demonstrate due regard to them as individuals, with evidence to show any potential for  adverse impacts / unlawful discrimination - and how these will be mitigated going forward.

Turns out there's two types of 'Equality':

- One where you make a bold statement of values as an introduction, blind your readers with pie charts (oh come on..) and then conclude with a grid of tick boxes stating things like 'disability - no issue', 'sexual orientation - no issue' and so on.

- The other is to write yourself some tough questions about your staff as individuals, then gather the data required to answer these - and evidence any points made with actual people data.

I felt that tick boxes weren't in the spirit of an exercise that's meant to recognise the individual, so chose to write a report style assessment..

- [The EHRC have a brilliant guide](http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/documents/PSD/equality_impact_assessment_guidance_quick-start_guide.pdf), with lots of prompt questions.

- [ACAS have a colourful guide](http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/f/b/Acas_managers_guide_to_equality_assessments.pdf), which I also looked at; but more for a 'sense check' rather than to take information from. [Their template](http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/s/f/Equality_Impact_Assessment.pdf) was a bit basic.

- And one of the [best examples](http://www.policeauthority.org/Metropolitan/downloads/work/eias/people.pdf) was the met police, they answer a lot of tough questions and I think show proper consideration.

Yes it is. We tend to fail to understand the complexities a politician and policy maker will meet in his or her duties and instead proffer our own views based in a much simplified version of reality. The reason we have everything we have now is because we do things slowly and within a framework of constructive but measured advancement. People forget that was a primary tenant of democracy; to remove rapid change which undermines the long term stability of the nations around us.

The following is my understanding, but I'm not an expert. If either of the above tell you something different then they're probably right.

You're in a fairly weak position.  AIUI the landlord doesn't have to allow you to rescind your notice so they can pretty much set whatever conditions they want for doing so.  If they've paid out for marketing on the assumption you're leaving it's not unreasonable to ask you to contribute to that.

That said everything is negotiable.  If you have a direct contact for the landlord this is a great time to use it, rather than trying to do things at one remove.

You do also have one thing in your favour, which is that the landlord almost certainly can't just turf you out on the day your notice expires - evicting residential tenants without a court order is a relatively serious criminal offence. AIUI your landlord has to go to court and get a court order which takes time and costs money. Courts also tend to be relatively sympathetic to tenants in genuine distress so may well give you more time to sort out alternative accommodation.  The whole legal process could easily stretch to the end of the year or beyond.

&gt; **Transfer-Hammer in der Bundesliga: Mittelfeldspieler Heung-Min Son von Bayer 04 Leverkusen steht offenbar kurz vor einem Wechsel auf die Insel. Die im Raum stehende Ablösesumme ist stattlich.**

&gt; Mittelfeldspieler Heung-Min Son vom Fußball-Bundesligisten Bayer 04 Leverkusen zieht es nach Informationen des „Kölner Stadt-Anzeigers“ zum englischen Erstligisten Tottenham Hotspur. Der 23-Jährige soll noch am Mittwoch zum Medizincheck nach London fliegen und dem Werksklub 30 Millionen Euro in die Kassen spülen.

&gt; Der Südkoreaner wechselte vor der Saison 2013/2014 für eine Ablöse von zehn Millionen Euro vom Ligakonkurrenten Hamburger SV zu Bayer Leverkusen. In 62 Bundesligaspielen für die Werkself erzielte er 21 Tore und gab sieben Vorlagen. Zudem kam der Mittelfeldspieler zu 19 Einsätzen in der Champions League, in denen er fünf Tore erzielte. Für die Südkoreanische Nationalmannschaft erzielte der Linksfuß elf Tore in 44 Spielen.

&gt; Sons Vertrag bei Bayer Leverkusen läuft noch bis zum 30. Juni 2018. (ksta)

Not really. Yes, taxes come out of wages, but it's taxes you'd be paying anyway even if there wasn't an NHS, &amp; only a small amount of that is for the health service. Not sure how it breaks down but probably only a quid or two or whatever. Meanwhile, Americans still have to deal with income tax &amp; *then* pay insurance premiums on top of that.

He may not improve our overall performance on the pitch in the same way that Berahino would (though I think this is more than disputable), but he'll be a reliable goal scorer at a price difference which will give us genuine leway for signing a CM.

He's arguably a better striker than

- Giroud
- Berahino
- Benteke
- Pelle
- Ings

And the goals he scored were for a relegation side, I don't think that's just down to hitting a ball hard, as much as /u/WindyCOYS would disagree.

Much like Chadli, Sigurdsson, Depsey, Defoe, Adebayor and Paulinho. Spurs fans have a weird habit of fighting tooth and nail to keep proven goal-scorers out of our squad.

Analysis of Employee Contracts that do
not Guarantee a Minimum Number of
Hours by the ONS:
&gt;Around 14% of people on “zero-hours contracts” are looking for another job, more than for people
not on “zero-hours contracts”, but indicates that most people on “zero-hours contracts” are currentlycontent to stay with their job which is the same conclusion drawn from the CIPD data.

4% of which want an additional job, leaving only 10% that want a replacement job with longer hours. 65% does not want more hours. 

&gt;The CIPD survey also asks employees directly about their experience of working on a “zero-hours
contract”, including their levels of satisfaction which show that 47% of those employed on “zerohours
contracts” are satisfied with having no minimum contracted hours compared with 27% being
dissatisfied.

&gt;George Osborne has won Nordic backing for Britain’s drive to reform its relationship with the EU, with his Finnish counterpart saying the UK’s demands were constructive and deliverable.

&gt;Alex Stubb, Finland’s finance minister, said Britain was justified in demanding economic reforms, restrictions on welfare benefits for migrant workers and a bigger role for national parliaments in EU decision-making.

&gt;“It’s a very constructive approach, results-orientated, problem-solving. It’s a path that will ensure UK membership for the foreseeable future,” Mr Stubb told the Financial Times.

&gt;But Mr Osborne’s warm reception on a three-capital tour of Finland, &gt;Sweden and Denmark on Monday could raise concerns among some Conservative MPs that the government has set its negotiating bar too low.

&gt;There were reports last week that Andrew Lansley, the former health minister, had told a business audience that David Cameron would “choreograph” a row with France to try to convince voters he had struck a hard bargain.

&gt;Although the three Nordic countries are strong allies of the UK in seeking economic reforms, Mr Stubb is a well-connected former EU official who has criticised British attitudes to Europe in the past.

&gt;Mr Stubb, once an adviser to the former European Commission president Romano Prodi, said after meeting Mr Osborne in Helsinki: “I believe without the UK there is no EU.”

&gt;He said Europe would have to find ways of ensuring eurozone countries did not try to distort the EU’s single market to their advantage and to the detriment of non-euro countries such as Britain.

&gt;“The UK economy is one of the biggest in the EU,” he said. “Some kind of solution will have to be found.”

&gt;Mr Stubb said the bloc also needed to address Britain’s concerns about immigration, noting the UK was one of the few EU countries that had opened its borders to former communist “accession” states, such as Poland, in 2004.

&gt;“This has had consequences for the NHS, education and social security systems,” he said.

&gt;Other EU leaders have warned against changing treaties to accommodate Britain’s wish to restrict benefits for migrant workers, but Mr Stubb said such changes could be delivered with less upheaval “through a directive or legislation”.

&gt;However, there are limits to the Nordic countries’ sympathy for the UK and some weariness of having to undertake EU reform at a time of economic uncertainty and a refugee crisis.

&gt;Meanwhile, the finance minister of Sweden, which like Britain is not in the eurozone, also stressed the importance of protecting EU countries outside the single currency and the need to avoid a UK exit from the EU.

&gt;Swedish finance minister Magdalena Andersson said: “For us it is important to have Britain within the European Union and we will of course engage constructively in those discussions that will be coming in that period.”

&gt;Mr Osborne, Mr Cameron’s de facto deputy, is taking an increasingly prominent role in the UK renegotiation and has a series of foreign visits planned before an EU summit in Brussels in October.

&gt;“From the conversations I have had generally, there is going to be room for agreement and room for finding a way forward,” Mr Osborne said after meeting Mr Stubb.",null,0,null,1440589456,null,null,false,0,cug58l6,null,t3_3igerf,null,null,null,t3_3igerf,null,null,null,1441505881,null,9,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

The issue is a massive problem because most my female friends have the unpleasant experience of these situations as well. 

Mind you I'm not going to talk about trains but instead buses, but it still is public transport. 

We both went to Rochester to study Art and Design at the uni there, however she lived in Maidstone which required her to get the bus every morning and night. 

She would tell me that at least once or twice a month she would get white older men, about 40 or 50-ish apparently, who would harass her just because she was pretty. Mind you this is just with buses and bus stations, sometimes if she went out shopping with her mum she would get unpleasant run ins with older men at times too.

However the main focus of this comment if about her experience on public transport. 

Usually it would be her waiting at the bus stop minding her on business, and then an older guy, or group of guys, would walk up to her and start asking her sexual stuff that would make her uncomfortable. 

On the bus however she would encounter people who act like creeps towards women, who keep harassing her even though she states that she wants to be left alone. One time she even had a guy on the bus constantly harassing her about details about her sex life, while taking photos of her on his phone despite her not wanting him too.

Another time there was a man on the bus who throughout the journey, changed seats to sit closer to her. Until he was sitting right next to her while starring at her the entire time, making her uncomfortable the entire ride. 
However as I said before It's not just on the bus that she has the problem. At bus stops she would get harassed just because she was a girl. 

At one time she was even reduced to tears by an older man who would just not leave her alone, who kept saying about what he would do to her and kept asking her to ""come with him"" to where no one could see them. He even kept asking her to open her mouth for him. The guy only left when his bus arrived, even after she kept repeatedly asking him to go away, even shouting it while in tears. 

The worst thing is there's usually people who see this happen, but do nothing and just ignore it.

Harassment towards women is a massive problem in this country that isn't really talked about, and when It is some people just shrug it off because it doesn't happen to them because of their gender. More needs to be done to protect women from harassment on public transport and in public places. At the moment women don't have much to protect themselves in situations like this, like pepper spray which is illegal.


These situations always have the chance to escalate to something much worse than they already are, and while the example I used was buses and bus stations, the same could happen on trains.

**Anti-Zionism** - the opposition to the ethnonationalist and political movement of Jews and Jewish culture that supports the establishment of a Jewish state as a Jewish homeland in the territory defined as the historic Land of Israel

**Anti - Israel** - Against the political State of Israel (manifested typically in the actions the state has taken against Palestine)

Network Rail (the state owned infrastructure company), as infrastructure owner, manager and operator, is responsible for issues with infrastructure and train delays that are caused by them. 

The Department for Transport (an arm of HM Government) signs off or makes any decision of any importance - they set the rate at which fares can increase, they decide where/when/how investment is made, they set service frequencies, etc. This includes telling state-owned Network Rail what to do. In Scotland some of this responsibility goes to Holyrood

The government already runs the railways, in effect. Private companies might do the day to day work of employing people to sit in trains, are responsible for how well their trains run and in being the public face of the industry, but they don't really run it.

null,null,GoodOlBluesBrother,null,null,null,"In the interview he said Rodgers told him to 'stay tight'. Which, coupled with where he was asked to play (ahead of Milner), was probably the reason he was chasing the ball so much. 

At youth level he seems to play his best football when the team press high and he is the deepest of the mids; breaking up play quickly and distributing the ball. More Lucas than a young Gerrard at this point, although with more of an eye for first time forward passes and probably more mobile. 

Yesterday I think these factors effected his natural game; big game league debut, score line + instructions, unfavoured position, how deep the team was playing by the time he came on. 

I remember when Lucas first started playing next to Masch. He too would chase the ball only for it to be played around him (Can seems to struggle with this a little which seems a bit of a concern with his size and turn of pace). It was frustrating and probably part of the reason he wasn't as appreciated by the fans as much as he is now. Having Masch do a very similar job probably didn't help. Anyway. My point is that Lucas learnt to not do that. And a younger more mobile Rossiter can do the same. 

Generally it's about a player getting used to the pace of the game; learning to pass and be ready to receive again instantly, as well as tracking an opponent after closing them down and being passed around (Rossiter's main gripe yesterday). The pace and space in which the game operates is so vastly different between youth and 1st team level it's crazy. So although he didn't have the best game as far as he is capable of at this time, it's too soon to be overly critical of him, especially considering the magnitude of the game and how pivotal Lucas was to holding the midfield together. Rossiter is clearly an intelligent player and considering the number of players ahead of him in midfield I think it's testament to him that Rodgers wants to keep him around the 1st team rather than loan him out for game time. It suggests he thinks the player can quickly get used to the pace without needing as many minutes as, say Lucas and Can needed and needs respectively (considering Can had a gentle introduction compared to baptism by fire in the middle of the park). 

Overall I thought he held his own very well. The midfield/defence did a great job of protecting each other through the whole game (exciting to see) which continued when Rossiter came on. He didn't contribute in attack as much as he did defensively yesterday but once he gains confidence and is up to the pace I can see him being very useful in a mobile 3 man midfield going both ways, and with scouse blood you know he'll put his body on the line for the team, just like Gerrard and Carra whom he grew up with. 

I'm excited for him. Rodgers seems to be too. The team need a scouse 1st teamer to set the level of commitment on the pitch every week. If the team can line up with Rossiter and Flannagan every week and be competitive I'll be proper made up.

It's unlikely that there would be for multiple reasons, not least the fact that generally intel isn't released to the public as it could compromise an investigation, source etc. It's a Facebook post, not a thorough presentation.

&gt; the report would have said 'suspected dealer' or somesuch. 

Not necessarily. The original Facebook post merely summarised but there could also be legal issues around calling someone a 'suspected dealer'. This does not mean that there wasn't a suspicion of dealing prior to the search, and it doesn't mean that investigations aren't ongoing, particularly as drugs 'equipment' was found (the post doesn't specify what and I'm not going through over 500 responses to see if there was an update).

&gt; So further assumption is they knew it was just a user with a small amount.

Your assumption. I assume by 'they' you mean the police, which leads me to my final point.

The Facebook post said the police executed a warrant, which would have been issued by a court, which is independent of the police and is required to take in to account all of the facts (both for and against). There would be more detail and justification there than in a Facebook post aimed at the general public.

Getting the mortgage in your girlfriend's sole name would, AFAIK, also require her to be the sole owner of the property - lenders do not generally allow the situation where owners and mortgage holders are different because it makes things a lot more complicated if they need to repossess.

That was Rory, and it really touched me. Because I forgot this, just like the Doctor. I had forgotten that there are little things in life, little victories everyone achieves, that mean just as much as every ""big decision"" or let's say saving the universe. We are so happy with Amy beeing really brave, and Rory beeing so dedicated and protecting, and the Doctor beeing brilliant and saving the day - I sometimes forget that I myself had some small victories that meant the world to me. Like when I finally found a method how to calculate that I wasn't super bad in, and my math grades got better. I was so flipping proud! That's isn't a small thing compared to saving the universe - every victory that was hard to achive has the same worth, and I finally understood that.

&gt; “Some women have raised with me that a solution to the rise in assault and harassment on public transport could be to introduce women only carriages.  
My intention would be to make public transport safer for everyone from the train platform, to the bus stop to the mode of transport itself. However, I would consult with women...”

Since he's also said:
&gt; “It is unacceptable that many women and girls adapt their daily lives in order to avoid being harassed on the street, public transport...”

I'd argue he doesn't even _want_ women-only carriages — he'd rather make things safe enough that no-one would consider them necessary.  
He's just not ruling it out.

It doesn't say it's illegal to do so, but it certainly doesn't say anywhere that pedestrians have right of way.

As you eluded to, Fabregas plays better when sitting in a 'Pirlo/Xavi' role (deep lying playmaker). But you need to remember he still has Barca DNA in him (short passes, 1-2s, tiki taka). So this would be the best fit, IMO:



(Almost like a 4-2-1-2-1 or 4-3-3 or 4-3-2-1, depending on situation)




------Pogba-----Matic--------





-----------Fabregas------------





---Pedro-------------Hazard---





--------------Costa---------------







It is worth noting that these systems are rigid and I see Pogba offering some flexibility by interchanging positions with Fabregas or line up beside Fabregas in an attacking-minded position. With the Pogba-Matic twin pillars, it will give extra protection to Terry/Cahill/Zouma and support for Ivanovic/Azpi/Baba on the wings. Pogba's versatility to join attack will also help our attacking Mids going forward. After watching Pogba play for club and country, he is the ultimate blend of Lampard+Essien+Makelele+height(Matic)!









At the end of the post, all these are hypothetical and Pogba is still a Juventus player. Worth every cent of the £70M, IMHO.







Edit: In response to the talk about Oscar being benched unfairly, he will be subbed on to replace Fabregas in the above system if we want to stabilize a game further (commonly known as ""parking the bus""). That said, a bus with Matic-Zouma-Pogba would be even harder to move.

&gt;Leverkusen season ticket holder here. Got ambivalent feelings about this. First of all, as mentioned by many in this thread, KStA is a source to take rather serious, they don't spread silly rumours. Additionally, Son was playing bad and missed the game against Hannover this Weekend due to a cold or something, make of that what you want. He's the kind of player that needs to be sent into space. He's got all the pace you could wish for and is absolutely fantastic at finishing at full speed, under pressing, 100% both footed, whatever you need. He consistently scores some amazing and important goals for us, which is why I'm very sceptical about him leaving. Brandt still has a long way to go in terms of consistency. Mehmedi looked good so far, but had some shaky finishing, which we have a big problem with anyways for two seasons now. I feel bad about letting a player go that just manages to get us goals. Additionally, if he goes, so does LG, our main sponsor. He's unbelievably popular in Korea, every single game you see dozens of koreans coming round and watching him. A word about why this isn't the end of the world though: While amazing at some things, he's utterly shit at other aspects of his game. Don't expect him to create many chances, he's absolutely not well versed as a playmaker and his decision making is shit, absolute shit. He hasn't really gotten any better at it in his time with us too, you still regularly see him running into three opposition players without really having the skill and/or creativity to beat them. Very frustrating. Also, as mentioned by others, he tends to play bad against bullying teams, which could really be a problem for him on a cold, rainy night in Stoke or however it goes.

The idea here being that the same people who wrote that nonsensical reply (https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/104349) are most likely hypocrites who use a plethora of drugs themselves.


In my opinion this is not the right way to go about it as it enforces the idea that drug-testing is something that should be done when in fact it is an invasion of privacy. The whole idea that taking drugs is something we should feel guilty about and should be prosecuted for is inherently wrong as we should really be wondering why people do drugs and how we can provide them with other means of recreation or escape. You will find that most addicts have other issues that led to drug use and not the other way round. 

To keep this short - the passionate side of me likes the idea of exposing the people who are responsible for shutting down yet another attempt to make the government see how out of touch they are with reality (i.e. their response to the petition mentioned above) however the rational side says that this is not the right way to go about it and we should rather send in further petitions asking for the legalisation of cannabis and other drugs until they cannot ignore us anymore.

Considering heroin metabolises to morphine in your body and 'meth' is already legally prescribed as Ritalin et al (even to lots of children and teenagers), most of the more 'dangerous' drugs are already legally used by thousands every day. Alcohol and sugar are arguably the most medically damaging drugs when long-term ABUSED.

Then we've got a stupid situation where relatively well studied and safe (safer than paracetamol chemically speaking) drugs like MDMA, LSD, Psilocybin are totally outlawed, even where potentially they have medical usages to treat things like depression and deserve much more research.

For some reason modern governments are incredibly scared of any thing that is 'state-of-mind altering'. Alcohol would be banned if it wasn't so easy to make at home with substances that would be impossible to ban (water, sugar and yeast).

Drug ABUSE is the enemy. Hell, physical self-harming abuse, emotional abuse, suicide, chemical abuse, ... etc... are all ultimately a symptom of mental health (and perhaps a more general reaction to stress and lack of happiness in modern society) issues.

* Corbyn is succeeding despite much of the media and Labour party figures coming out forcefully against him

* There are [...] deeper political and social reasons explaining why Corbyn and his outspoken leftist ideas have become so popular

* Corbyn’s rise fits in the prolonged quest of the left to rediscover a new identity, to regain a sense of pride and to rebuild confidence in the strength and moral authority of its own message.

* Put differently, many people are more than fed-up with the left blatantly accepting the basic logics, values and arrogance of neoliberalism. Instead, many want a serious, forceful and ideologically robust opposition

* In many ways, he represents a different kind of politician, a man of principles and convictions rather than a smooth operator willing to do anything to get into power and be ‘electable’.

* Above all, Corbyn has the very rare gift of presenting leftist ideas, such as the redistribution of wealth or the provision of high quality public services, as if it were the most normal and sensible thing to do.

* What we have seen in recent decades is the deliberate de-ideologisation and normalisation – some would say naturalisation – of rightwing and neoliberal solutions to solve the many problems of our society. Rightwing solutions are, in other words, common sense, full stop. 

* Alternative solutions, on the contrary, are denoted as ideological, as biased, as dangerous and loony. It is high time that the (centre-) left learns this lesson and starts to propose leftwing solutions again as sensible solutions

Context is important. But if there are 'worse' things she was doing, presumably there would be no need to prosecute her for merely possessing information.

'Yes, this thing definitely happens, but we shouldn't take steps to try and stop it happening because we're not certain what causes it'. Is this your argument?

The thing about lists was a joke. It's not possible to make a set of lists and then argue who has it worse, because you can't quantify 'Worse'. That is why we have the concept of intersectionality, which is kind of an incredibly important idea for the left. The upshot of it is that you can make statements about power, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

But I guess at this point, everyone else has an opinion, so I might as well offer mine.

First, I don't know whether a new owner would have done any better than Kenwright and company.  Both sides can point to examples, and both sets of examples are equally plausible.  We could have been Man City, or we could have been Villa; we could have been Chelsea, or we could have been QPR.  You can't really know ahead of time which will work out.  Owners go flaky (Lerner), or are semi-nuts to begin with (Tan), or turn out spectacularly (Abramovich).  So I think this is a perfectly neutral factor in evaluating the current board.

Looking strictly at on-field performance, I think the tenure has been largely but not entirely positive.  The biggest disappointment is that there have been no trophies.  That's obviously huge.  But really when we say no ""trophies,"" we are saying ""haven't won a cup competition,"" and cups can be flaky (how many years did Arsenal go without one?)  And I'm not sure many people would feel all that much better if, say, we had won the league cup five years ago.  Still, this is the biggest black mark against the current board; at some point, you have to win something, anything.

Off the field performance has been far more mixed, especially when it comes to commercial development.  The stadium deals have been a failure, although it should be noted that every realistic scenario has had some pretty marked drawbacks.  Everton should be getting more from merchandising and sponsorship deals.  This board has not had a keen eye for marketing, and for a club where pennies count, this failure is critical.  In non-commercial respects (off-field involvement, etc.), though, Everton has been extraordinary. 

Where I ultimately come down is this: I think Kenwright and company did a mostly creditable job taking a club that was on the brink of turning into a basketcase and allowing it to stabilize.  I doubt that the group has the means are the savvy to press the club forward from there, and for that reason, I do think a transition to new ownership would be a positive gamble (though still a gamble, and a big one).

But I also think that Kenwright has been a faithful servant to the club.  The club's failings during his tenure have been minor, relatively speaking; if nothing else, we haven't gone down, which is more than most clubs can say, and more than maybe could have been expected when he took over.  If it is time for him to go, I think the dialogue should be respectful, in much the same way we wouldn't completely slag off a player who served the club competently but unspectacularly for 15 years but is now past it.  Whether he's the right blue for the job in 2015, he's still a blue.

We model the spontaneous formation of spatially localized openings of a damped and driven DNA chain, and find that linear instabilities lead to dynamic dimerization, while true local strand separations require a threshold amplitude mechanism. Based on our results we argue that a specific terahertz radiation exposure may significantly affect the natural dynamics of DNA, and thereby influence intricate molecular processes involved in gene expression and DNA replication.""

'The Palestinians have been treated badly, there is no doubt about that. Britain, America, fellow Arabs, Zionists – all are to blame.

This is fair, this would constitute a modicum of justice. But this is not what Hamas wants. Like Isis in Iraq and Syria, like al Qaeda, the Shabab in Somalia and Boko Haram in Nigeria, it seeks to destroy Western neighbours. And the Nick Cleggs of this world, who call on Britain to suspend arms sales to Israel, are their accomplices. It’s as if they really don’t understand the world they live in, like those liberals in Britain and France who called for disarmament and pro-German treaty revision in the Thirties.

1. a [B'Twin](http://www.decathlon.co.uk/20-racing-boy-320-kids-bike-blue-id_8327767.html) 5-speed (approx £90)

My reviews:

1. Weighs a tonne, my son hates it. Can't blame him. Piece of shit made from scaffolding tubes.
1. Really good wee bike. Not super heavy, but not cheap either! It breaks my heart to see the way it's abused by the kids, given the price.
1. Poorer quality than the Dawes (e.g. plastic v-brakes versus metal on the Dawes) but not super heavy. Pretty naff plastic brakes levers too. Half the price of the Dawes, but certainly much more than half the bike. 

The only reason for buying the Dawes was that the recipient had a little brother coming up behind him to pass it on to. Unfortunately the younger one is a big lad and outgrew his other wee bike too quickly, hence the cheap-and-cheerful BTwin as a stopgap.

When next buying, I'd definitely look at Decathlon to start with, only moving up if the wrong corners appear to have been cut. ",null,0,null,1440597861,null,null,false,0,cug8xx9,null,t3_3ig2iv,null,null,null,t3_3ig2iv,null,null,null,1441507691,null,2,null,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

I hate to say it, but to me Mcd's weren't abusing the zero hour contract at all- I quite enjoyed it.

We had an online portal where we could define what days we were available to work on a week by week basis, and I was often times scheduled for all of the hours I wanted. 

At times I was able to work the 6 days a week 12 hour shifts that I wanted (Yes, illegal, no, I didn't care, needed the money) and when I got out of that hole I went back to working 4 days a week with normal shifts. 

I reckon zero hour contracts are fair- as long as they're not abused by the employer. I've read about the shit where employee's have to be 'on standby' for 8 hours and only clock on when there's work available. that shit is unfair. And whilst I'm not a fan of the benefits system, taking someone's benefits away because they won't take a zero hour job is not cool. 

But overall, if the employee knows what they're into, the employer can provide solid, somewhat consistent hours the employee wants, what's wrong with that? It solidifies the reasoning that zero hour jobs are for the likes of students and single parent families- those that need flexibility in their work.

1. Drug tests are easily evaded. Cocaine persists in the system for a very short time.
2. Drug testing is expensive
3. This will capture the MPs who have an occasional spliff and quietly push for drug law reform until they are in a position to loudly push for it when they have moved up the ranks. It will not capture the idiots who think that the only reason people use drugs is because their lives are desperately sad.
4. This sets a terrible precedent for invasion of privacy outside of work hours. You better believe I work fucking hard all week but come the weekend I like to take some MDMA occasionally. 
5. We should not be accepting the idea that drug use is some terrible thing.

What would the reaction be? What would Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters do?

Honestly, I wouldn't mind this.  As long as it's been done entirely in terms of keeping the dialogue open.  We should honestly keep the platform open to people we don't agree with in the slightest, in the name of considering all sides and upholding free speech.

null,null,pacifismisevil,null,null,null,"Let's look at some facts about Corbyn, for all the people who claim he is not an anti-semite:

1. He supports ethnically cleansing Jews from the West Bank. His anti-semitism when it comes to Israel is clear by this and his [long disproven](http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2010/01/06/correction_israel_palestinians_story/) claim there are Jew only roads in the West Bank.

2. He has stood arm in arm with [Hugo Chavez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez#Allegations_of_Anti-semitism). He supports many totalitarian regimes around the world - the ones that are ""coincidentally"" the biggest enemies of the UK and USA, and which have domestic policies totally contrary to his supposed liberal views.

3. He has worked for Iranian state television. The Ayatollahs are vehemently opposed to communism and secularism - the only reason he likes Iran is because of their anti-american and anti-Israel views and [their funding of terrorism around the world against American allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism).

4. He publicly praises Putin and Russia Today.

5. He calls Hamas and Hezbollah friends, and tries to claim he was just being diplomatic but he also then claims Hamas and Hezbollah are dedicated to ""bringing about long-term peace and social justice and political justice in the whole region"" so it is obvious he meant it when he called them friends. This is the Hamas ""social justice"" that jails women for 5 years for having children outside of wedlock, and have executed hundreds of ""collaborators"" without trial [who in reality had no links to Israel](https://vimeo.com/125778303). He says the British government labeling them terrorist organisations ""is really a big, big historical mistake.""

6. He has made anti-Israel policies his highest priority. He writes more about Israel than his own constituency on his website. His 3 sons are likewise obsessed with demonising Israel on their Facebook accounts. 

7. It is difficult not to see a pattern in Mr Corbyn’s associations. He has strongly associated with holocaust deniers, terrorists and antisemites, and publicly defended them. There is little doubt he is untroubled by anti-semitic views amongst his friends.

8. [Corbyn jumped to Stephen Sizer’s defense](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3191393/Jeremy-Corbyn-defended-controversial-vicar-banned-social-media-promoting-clearly-anti-Semitic-material.html), saying that Sizer was under attack by a “pro-Israel smear campaign.”

9. Corbyn recently pulled out of a meeting where he was due to appear on a platform with Latuff, second prize winner in Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s Holocaust Denial cartoon contest, and Azzam Tamimi, a London defender of Hamas who says that suicide bombing is a “noble cause” and he would do it if he had the opportunity. It's not that he was unaware of these things when he agreed to attend, he just didn't want the controversy after it became public knowledge. 

10. Corbyn is a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, an organization dedicated to fighting for a boycott of Israel and which has a record of tolerating anti-Semitism within its ranks. Corbyn supported Deir Yassin Remembered for years after it had become clear that its founder Paul Eisen was an open Holocaust denier. He believes [Israel is the sole country in the world deserving of a boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World#Middle_East_and_North_Africa), and opposes sanctions on Iran - a country that hangs gay men in the street.

11. Corbyn was pictured hosting spokespeople for the IRA days after that organization had tried to kill prime minister Margaret Thatcher in the Brighton bombing. Pictures have emerged of Corbyn sitting next to Dyou Abou Jahjah on a platform, a man who says that the “death of every British soldier is a victory.”

12. His opposition to democracy in Northern Ireland and the Falklands is contrary to the views of the British public.

13. He has [hosted meetings in Parliament in which journalists who are pro-Israel were banned from attending](http://ukmediawatch.org/2010/07/30/richard-millet-and-jonathan-hoffman-banned-from-parliament/). An extreme misuse of government property.

14. Jeremy Corbyn MP has sponsored and signed a number of Early Day Motions in parliament that praise Interpal for its ""humanitarian work"" and condemn the ""damaging designation of Interpal"" as a terror-support organization. Interpal is led by [holocaust denier](http://www.thecommentator.com/article/4910/tell_the_truth_about_terrorism_and_islamic_charities) Ibrahaim Hewitt who has stated: ""Jews cannot be entrusted with the sanctity and security of this Holy Land."" “The undeniable fact that the creation of the state (of Israel) is the prime cause of the unrest in the Middle East.” Oxfam pulled out of an event he was at, not because of his anti-semitic views but because he claims to want homosexuals to suffer “severe punishments” for their “great sin.” Ibrahm Dar (Abu Hana), the Bradford representative of Interpal, is an open admirer of  Anwar Al-Awlaki, a major al-Qaeda leader whose main ambition is blow up U.S. planes.

Overall, he is strongly associated with people who hope for the death of British soldiers, with anti-Semites, with homophobes and with woman-haters. He claims to be left wing and liberal but his greatest foreign friends are some of the most right wing and illiberal regimes in the world.",null,1,null,1440598859,null,null,false,0,cug9j43,null,t3_3igck7,null,null,null,t3_3igck7,null,null,null,1441507968,null,-1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

So like Corbyn *is* succeeding, but we only know so much about this success, who he is successful with and so on. 

Then you get:

&gt; Corbyn’s rise fits in the prolonged quest of the left to rediscover a new identity, to regain a sense of pride and to rebuild confidence in the strength and moral authority of its own message.

Which is all nice sounding and intuitive but doesn't really mean too much. It's just extrapolating more from the evidence than might actually be sensible, and dramatising this whole ""quest for identity."" It's true they're on a quest, but does he even make an effort to argue *why* it should be in a certain direction?

&gt; Put differently, many people are more than fed-up with the left blatantly accepting the basic logics, values and arrogance of neoliberalism. Instead, many want a serious, forceful and ideologically robust opposition

""New"" consensus good, old consensus bad. It homogenizes the opposition without even trying to examine what those basic logics, values are or mean but just dismisses it all as ""arrogance."" Neoliberalism's a great buzzword but the way he uses it is kind of meaningless. 

It's followed by more shallow assertions like:

&gt; In many ways, he represents a different kind of politician, a man of principles and convictions rather than a smooth operator willing to do anything to get into power and be ‘electable’.

&gt; Above all, Corbyn has the very rare gift of presenting leftist ideas, such as the redistribution of wealth or the provision of high quality public services, as if it were the most normal and sensible thing to do.

A ""very rare gift?"" Seriously? As if Corbyn is the only one who can articulate leftist values and that these are ideologically homogeneous as well. Preceded by some other shallow, dichotomous points about how special he is and how corrupt non-believers are. 

And then this nice dropping at the end:

&gt; What we have seen in recent decades is the deliberate de-ideologisation and normalisation – some would say naturalisation – of rightwing and neoliberal solutions to solve the many problems of our society. Rightwing solutions are, in other words, common sense, full stop.

&gt; Alternative solutions, on the contrary, are denoted as ideological, as biased, as dangerous and loony. It is high time that the (centre-) left learns this lesson and starts to propose leftwing solutions again as sensible solutions

Where he basically calls for an end of idealogical normalisation by replacing it with a ""new"" ideological normalisation. Just because they are denoted biased, ideological or whatever doesn't mean they are, but it doesn't mean they aren't either. He does nothing to really argue for his own position, just asserts what he and others don't like.

It's completely circular and self-serving.  ",null,0,null,1440599061,null,null,false,0,cug9nhb,null,t3_3ig876,null,null,null,t1_cug9142,null,null,null,1441508025,null,1,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,1,null

Point me to a single place in the green cross code that tells you that you can treat crossing at lights with an island as a single piece of road -  you can't because it doesn't exist. There are no special rules for traffic light crossings with islands that pedestrians right of way across the whole piece of road. The rules for islands without lights are: 

&gt; Where there are no controlled crossing points available it is advisable to cross where there is an island in the middle of the road. Use the Green Cross Code (see Rule 7) to cross to the island and then stop and use it again to cross the second half of the road.

You know what the The Green Cross Code says about stepping into moving traffic as a pedestrian when the light for you is red? It says don't fucking do it. Seriously, point me to this magical rule that overrides the rule above when traffic lights are in place *and* which magically undoes the advice given for Controlled Zebra Crossings as well:

&gt; Where there is an island in the middle of a zebra crossing, wait on the island and follow Rule 19 before you cross the second half of the road – it is a separate crossing.

And which undoes the advice for staggered islands as well:

&gt; ‘Staggered’ pelican or puffin crossings. When the crossings on each side of the central refuge are not in line they are two separate crossings. On reaching the central island, press the button again and wait for a steady green figure.

Seriously, just because there isn't something explicitly dealing with non staggered pelican crossings doesn't mean that the fundamental rule of traffic islands is suddenly not applicable.

I strongly doubt Alli will be used out wide when all his brilliance has been from the center of the pitch.  He was a box-to-box CM a la Mason at MK Dons, came on for the same Mason in our first match, and played really well as our #10 against Leicester, after coming on for Lamela, who started that match at #10 in lieu of an injured Eriksen.

All said, I think there are plenty of more than useful alternatives in the squad already, though Son may be the one we're bringing in to replace him before letting him move back to Italy.

We don't. We hate terrorists.  A lot of terrorists are (or claim to be) Muslim. So some people don't like Muslims. Also there's a lot of issues (which may be non-issues) of Muslims imposing their culture and laws on to communities. 

This isn't an issue with the Jewish. They don't pose a terrorist threat to the UK. And while some might be imposing their culture and laws on to communities its something that has been in place for a long time.

“It's hard to talk about the importance of an imaginary hero. But heroes ARE important: Heroes tell us something about ourselves.
History tells us who we used to be, documentaries tell us who we are now; but heroes tell us who we WANT to be.
And a lot of our heroes depress me.
But when they made this particular hero, they didn't give him a gun--they gave him a screwdriver to fix things. They didn't give him a tank or a warship or an x-wing fighter--they gave him a box from which you can call for help. And they didn't give him a superpower or pointy ears or a heat-ray--they gave him an extra HEART. They gave him two hearts! And that's an extraordinary thing.
There will never come a time when we don't need a hero like the Doctor.”
- Steven Moffat

Another one of my favorites, actually come from a forum:

""But Doctor Who, at its best, is kind of limitless imagination, charm outreaching its ability. Doctor Who regularly sees things which are beyond its reach but tries to grasp them anyway.
The best of Who makes me go 'motherf***er!'""

&gt; Anyway leaving aside the merits of the protest, it and the normalisation process are polar opposites here - undermining the 'gesture' Adams claims he was making.

No they are not. When there are still issues between two countries, they are not going to achieve full normalisation until those issues (however painful) are ironed out.

&gt; And anyway, SF would never admit that 'both parts of the island want and need very different things' so your engaging in verbal gymnastics to justify obvious two-faced behaviour of SF.

How is what I am saying verbal gymnastics? It's a fact, and it's easy to see that SF has two different attitudes toward how they do politics in both parts of Ireland.

In the South - they deal with southern issues (water charges etc), in the north they deal with northern issues like equality and justice. That itself shows that both parts of Ireland need different things to be prioritised, whether they openly state it isn't important, their actions show that they know this.

Isn't that to be expected? He's the only one of the candidates who doesn't seem to be in the ""continue with the status quo of letting Israel do whatever they want"" camp (or at least, is the most anti Zionist of them).  
Of course any anti-Zionist/full blown anti Semite is much more likely to be in his corner.

That doesn't make Corbyn an anti Semite any more than it makes Nigel Farage a racist as far as I can see. 

In fact I think the ukip comparison works pretty well here. They're both on the edge of the mainstream, so people with ideas outside the mainstream, far past anything that Corbyn/Farage agree with themselves, support them. 

The major difference I can see is that ukip have their immigration policy front and centre while Israel isn't a major issue to most Corbyn supporters.

My understanding of an honour system is that it works by social shaming, people won't go into the ""women only"" carriage because of the death-stares and quiet tutting they'd get from their fellow commuters, but would you get that if you change the rules overnight? Culture shift needs time to bed in and needs the overwhelming majority of people to believe in it. How many of these places with an honour system in place have had it in place since the trains first started? How many have the space on the trains to allow the policy to work? Are people going to go along with the rule which leaves 30 men standing on the platform at rush hour because the male carriage was full when there is space in the female carriage? Or are people going to actively stop one or two women getting onto the male only carriage because that's the only one with space left?

And regardless of all this, why are we assuming that segregated trains would actually fix anything at all? Is harassment only Male-&gt;Female or Female-&gt;Male?

Theres no way to cut this idea which doesn't make it seem ridiculous in my mind and it's not like he's been trapped by the media or a loaded question, [he's put it out there in black and white of his own free will](http://www.jeremyforlabour.com/end_street_harassment).

When you're a backbench MP its fine to pipe up and ""raise the question"" or ""spur some debate"" but part of being a leader is about being able to know and champion what the voters want and that can deliver a benefit and to know when to say ""No, that won't work, next idea"". 

To put it in a policy document would suggest that its something he is open to but even a short thought experiment would say theres no way you could practically enforce it and (to me at least) it seems obvious the idea would go down like a lead balloon.

EDIT - To respond you your edit. That brings us back round to the point I made earlier, if you're going to deploy some resource to segregate certain trains, then you've got the resource there to stop things happening in the first place without segregation.

&gt;""Every pathology of the anti-Semite can be visited upon the Jewish state in the flimsy guise of ""anti-imperialism"" or ""human rights"". It's all okay because it's ""Zionism"" you're against and that's not the same thing as Jews and what about Jews who are anti-Zionist. The hallmark of a bigot is seizing on dissonant voices within a minority community and using them to delegitimise the mainstream of that community. The exception becomes the rule and those whose only connection to Jewish communal life is signing onto letters to the Guardian denouncing Israel become more Jewish than everyone else.

&gt;It shouldn't have to be said but since stupidity is nearing pandemic levels these days I'll say it all the same. There is nothing anti-Semitic about criticising Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud-led government, or the policies of the State of Israel. There is nothing anti-Semitic about sympathising with the plight of the Palestinians (though it might be nice to recognise their culpability in the conflict too). There is nothing anti-Semitic about lacerating Israel for walls and checkpoints and bombs.

...

&gt;The problem goes deeper than asymmetry. For too many on the Left, Jewish suffering does not touch them the way Muslim suffering or gay suffering or black suffering touches them. Scrutiny of Corbyn's associations elicits cries of ""smear"" or just a collective shrug of the shoulders. It was always going to.

Some issues with RT is their oksana boyko and peter lavelle shows, the first one is way too nationalist, and lavelle invites 2 guests on who side with him and argue with one guy who disagrees with them, but he's doing this to get a narrative across via group think or something.

That was deliberate.

&gt;The headline gives the impression that Corbyn would damage the party's chances of being elected

Exactly. And all that's been in this sub for weeks now are headlines which suggest the opposite, that he will be good for the party (let alone the country) and they're being crazily upvoted, with sometimes four at the top of the page. Corbyn is the man of the moment in this sub, so I knew he'd be the one who people would be most interested in hearing about, so he went in the headline.

It was an experiment. I wanted to know what the reaction would be to poll results which suggest that the nation as a whole is rather cool towards him, given that it's so out of line with the narrative here, which makes him sound like the new political whirlwind. And it turns out it hasn't gone down well and this post will probably never end-up anywhere near the front page and be barely seen by anyone. That's not surprising, but I still find it interesting, in terms of the attitudes towards politics it paints of people here.

Speaking of the poll though, you're absolutely right that the results show that no one else is looking particularly electable either. That's what the comments section is for though, unless you want each headline on this sub to be three paragraphs long. The headline is just supposed to be a short sentence to grab you, and for sure the most interesting finding of the poll is about Corbyn, at least I think so anyway.",null,0,null,1440602276,null,null,false,0,cugbodz,null,t3_3igpux,null,null,null,t1_cug8jks,null,null,null,1441508979,null,0,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

- If you have reached the end of your tenancy (12 months) and if you are paying rent monthly as is per usual, they will only be required to give you two months notice to evict you ([Section 21 notice](https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices)).

- If you are still within the fixed term of your original tenancy and the contract does contain a break clause, your landlord can submit a section 21 notice, and you will have to leave 2 months after, if the day the notice comes into effect lands *after* the break clause period.

- If you are still within the fixed term of your original tenancy (12 months) and the contract does not contain a break clause, although the landlord may use a section 21 you do not have to leave the property until the end of the tenancy term. The landlord will have to make a court order.

- The landlord can also evict you using a section 8 notice, but this is used when the tenancy agreement has been breached (for example, you haven't paid rent). The landlord will have to seek a court possession order for repossession by proving that there are either mandatory grounds for possession (e.g. have not paid rent for 8 weeks for a weekly tenancy or 2 months for a monthly tenancy) or discretionary grounds (your actions are disruptive. Once the court order has been made, you have 14 days to leave the property.

There's several wheel sizes, 16 inch, 18 inch, 20 inch and 24 inch to consider as well as the length of the top tube for reach and stuff like that. 20 inch is the ""standard"" for most people, but might be too big for a 7 year old. 24 is for cruiser bmx's. So finding out whether he requires a 16, 18 or 20 inch wheel or a 20 inch or smaller top tube at a shop would be better than guessing and ordering a bike to put together and finding he doesn't fit. You can never be too big for a full size bmx (I rode 20 inch wheels with a 21 inch top tube and was 6ft 6), but you can be too small.  

The spinning bar gizmo the other guys are on about are called [gyroscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detangler). Depending on whether he needs one or not is down to what he wants to ride. I never used a gyro as I rode BMX trails and rode brakeless, or with just a back brake. But for a 7 year old kid, you'll probably want one. Especially if he intends on riding street or park (there's now loads of ""skate parks"" around the country he can ride... when I was riding in the 90s and early 00s there wasn't a single one). Gyroscopes are also a pain in the ass to fit, so getting a proper shop that knows what they're doing to fit one when putting a bike together is a good idea.

Next is material. Some are saying to avoid the cheap and cheerful Chinese / own brands, but for a kid starting out BMXing I would go with some generic branded BMX over the much more expensive ""made by riders, for riders"" bikes. If it's something he takes a love and shine to, you can look to those types of bikes in the future. More expensive ""pro"" bikes are also a magnet for thieves. Depending on were you live, this could be a problem. He's also going to continue growing, so he's going to scale up in wheel and frame sizes. Forking out for a very expensive pro level bike, only for him to be too big for it several months to a year down the line is a waste. 

And get him a helmet. A full face if you can. I've suffered numerous concussions during my riding years and had my scalp stapled shut a few times. If he complains it doesn't look cool, remind him that BMX stands for ""bicycle motorcross"" and get him a [number plate](http://i.imgur.com/8HFuRk4.jpg) too so he can pretend to be a motorcross rider. It'll encourage helmet use. Which is never a bad thing. Also, show him BMX videos of things like the BMX contest in the X-Games.

I understand we're supposed to value Lamela's playmaking ability over his goal scoring, but the simple fact is that he's just not doing enough, and he's become a liability.  He can't defend, he gives the ball away, and he doesn't create enough.

It isn't that he's only had 1 full season, or that he has had a bad start to this season, it's that it's the same problems.  If he started this season and just couldn't slot the ball into the net, it'd be a bad run of form.  But he's started this season and the same issues from last season (knocked off the ball, bad giveaways, no creativity, still no pace) are still there.

To counter their massively inflated figure, a low point would be saying it's 1000 people, and instead of buying a new dvd for every stream they watch, they decide to pay for the closest thing to free streaming: Netflix.

I know everyone knows what it's like to be interrupted. Ironically, given the topic of disucssion, my mum is a nightmare for interrupting people! But being interrupted occasionally, by some people, is *not* the same as being interrupted all the time, which is what happens to women.

The line about men writing a list was a joke: I was suggesting that the fact that you, as a man, had come up with a nondescript list of issues as evidence that communication wasn't sufficiently important, was a little ironic in the light of the discussion we were having about whether or not the male voice was privileged.

As an LGBT person, you will indeed know what it's like to have your ideas ignored: The Metropolitan Police actually give training on this, because witness statements by LGBT people are far more likely to be ignored or dismissed by police -- and the same is the case for witness statements by women (and ethnic minorities and disabled people). For that reason (and others), I'm very much in favour of positive discrimination for all those groups, in the Labour Party and beyond. This goes back to the issue of intersectionality, which I mentioned earlier.

I'm glad you've finally brought up something as an example, rather than just referring vaguely to some things that might happen to men: Suicide is indeed more common among men. However, Men and women *attempt* suicide at roughly the same rates; men are just more successful because of the methods they tend to choose.

My mum is manager at a local cafe, and there's fucking no way that they could survive without being able to give people flexible shifts. Similarly, the employees enjoy the flexibility of the system (some work less if they're tired, some work more if they want to save up for something). 

I suppose it depends on how good a relationship businesses have with their staff. But for small business I think they're generally able to get a good balance that suits everyone. I worry that making the concept illegal wouldn't hurt the big employers like McDonalds, only smaller businesses.

Granted, several issues with Goetze:

- CM: Who of Milner, Henderson and Lucas do you put at DM and who do you put on the bench? Only one can play DM and the other two will want out if put on the bench
- RM/CAM: Issues with Firmino, Sturridge, Coutinho and if the formation changes, Lucas. This might send Milner/Henderson to CDM together and they will look more restricted. Pick two of Lucas, Firmino, Sturridge and Coutinho to ride the bench before wanting out within a year.
- CF/ST: I don't think he's a better option than Benteke/Sturridge in this area.

Should the Club do a last ditch effort to get him (highly unlikely), the only area I see Goetze in without causing issues this season is as a super-sub where he can read the game, Rodgers puts him in for an under-performing player and he makes an immediate change.

He responds with something along the lines of ""Oh shut up""... which, incidentally is exactly what I thought when I watched the video.

She then presumably flips him off (out of camera shot - because you have to remember that during this entire scenario *she* is the one that knows firstly, that it's being recorded at all, and secondly *what* is being recorded.  ""*Oh please don't hurt me*"", she says in a submissive and unassuming manner into the microphone as she passes the guy.  

""Shut up..."" came the reply.

And it was in that moment she *knew* that she could take the piss, because she was bulletproof with her video/audio evidence.  She stuck her finger up at him, after he had done nothing to her.  She inferred he was going to hurt her as she rode past, when all he was doing was crossing the road.  He told her to get stuffed.  Then she flipped him off.  Silently (not picked up by the microphone), and out of the line of sight of the camera.  

Imagine this from the guys perspective.  Stupid woman rides past, insinuates that you meant to hurt her.  You didn't - you were just crossing the road.  So you tell her to shut the fuck up.  As she rides off, she fucking flips you off.  What the fuck!

Then of course, she goes and hands in her crafted evidence to the police, to get you in as much trouble as she possibly can.  She wants your face on the newspapers.  She wants your name in the court archives.  She wants you fined and in a cell.  To teach you a lesson.  Because you're a nasty little chav who pushes people off bicycles.

I know I should stop coming here because people are so lacking in knowledge about the realities of politics (and it's not their fault because most people here are young like I was, and I see myself in a lot of the comments) but every day I come back for more and enjoy it more than I should.

In the end, unfortunately Corbyn will be elbowed out before the electoral rout so people will forever talk here about how he would have been Labour's saviour, when perhaps it would do them better to see what the country as a whole would have thought about his policies, but there you go.

null,null,lets_chill_dude,null,null,null,"Firstly, I disagree strongly with positive discrimination, even when it favours me. I prove my own strength and let it be shown that gay people aren't effeminate or weak. If I had been given any preferential treatment at all, it would have undermined all my work. For example, person a doesn't get a job because person b is black, and is slightly less qualified. In the workplace, person b will be constantly referred to as only getting the job for being black, but so will other black employees who made the cut without the positive discrimination, and now their ability is questioned too. If person B fails, all the people who thought black people were inferior feel they have been proved right, and person a becomes embittered because they lost a job to someone they know was less qualified than them. I believe strongly in evening out black/ white balances, but not at all in quotas, as I believe they do more harm than good. 

I was trying to avoid any specifics because we were debating the boundaries of the debate. I was under the impression you had said it would matter if a list of men's problems rivalled a women's list, because the power structure meant it wasn't even anyway. Since you *have* welcome examples, then let me give a few more. In education, the vast majority of primary teachers are female, and a smaller majority of secondary are female. Boys are more likely to get kicked out of school after GCSEs, and girls do better in them and alevels. As a result, a significant majority of university students are female. The reaction? We need to address the majority of males in physics, maths and CS, never once have I heard about getting more makes into *all the other subjects which exist*. Beyond that we have families. Firstly, if a couple get pregnant, and the women doesn't want the baby and the man does, the man has zero input and the baby can be aborted. If the woman does want it, and the man doesn't, the baby is born *and* the man has to pay child support. As a thread the other day here noted, there have been cases of statutory rape of young boys and those boys still had to pay child support. Obviously the pregnancy phase means women should have a greater input, but it doesn't mean that men aren't damaged greatly in both circumstances. Later in life, after a divorce, women are far more likely to get custody of children, even if they are to blame for the divorce through affairs. Next, justice: if a man and woman commit the same crime, the women is less likely to go to jail. If they are both sentenced, the women will on average receive a shorter sentence, and then if they both get equal sentences, women are more likely to be let out early. The response? Feminists fight to remove all women from prison. Men die a lot due to gender imbalances: much more money is spent on female specific cancer than male related cancer. Men die much more often as a result of dangerous work. As you said, the suicide rate is way higher than in females, although attempts are more equal, although the higher death rate from it does make it a gendered issue. Men are also much more likely to be homeless. 

So education, health, family life, housing and dangerous work are all areas where men have it worse, and my list definitely wasn't exhaustive. So, yes, I do recognise that women have gender specific problems, and I want them helped. But the idea that women have it way worse, when all the above exists, is not one that I accept. Both genders need helped, and equally. Not one of the above issues has come up in this campaign, and I think that's completely unfair.

Taking a rough mathematical model **assuming** you are able to take the £9.50 hourly job, £3500 divided by 9 months is ~£368 you would need to earn per month. 368/9.5 would tell you the number of hours you'd need to work in a month to earn this, which comes out to around 38 hours per month (or just over 9 hours a week).

Obviously, this doesn't factor in any other spending on rent/travel/drinking heavily to block out the futility of life. Add on an extra ~3 hours of working a week to cover your £30 leisure budget (good luck with that in London btw) and maybe an extra £50 a week for food (~5 hours work) you're looking at needing to work around 17 hours a week to keep that up.

I'd say that equates to roughly a 2-days-a-week part time job stacking glasses for 8.5 hours each shift.

Over the course of a year or so, he really came on leaps and bounds which eventually saw him building some really interesting programs with some very cool uses. He is now on an apprenticeship whilst completing a degree as part of the apprenticeship program for a very large firm in the UK on their development team. He made a portfolio of the programs he built and gave a short demonstration/talk to the company which lead to them deciding to hire him. 

With development, building a portfolio seems to be the key to getting in to employment opportunities because an employer can see what you can offer them. University is another option, however, you may want to start earning money and gaining experience?

Are you moving to back to Bulgaria permanently (as far as you know)? If so, then no.

The rules on your tax 'domicile' are quite complex, but generally if you are no longer resident in the UK (which you won't be after you leave, obviously), and the UK is not your 'domicile' (i.e., your permanent home where you intend to return), then you aren't liable for anything (except any tax on work you did while you were in the UK).

Also, it goes without saying that... there's no way the UK authorities know what you're doing in Bulgaria.

I would also check Bulgarian tax laws - you may be liable for Bulgarian tax on the money you earned here. Don't worry if this is the case though, [there is a double tax treaty (like most countries)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bulgaria-tax-treaties-in-force) which stops one government taxing it if the other government already has.

exactly! didn't say that hendo and milner were better than xabi and masch (although masch and alonso were great, maybe part of the best midfield we have ever had). BUT what i was meaning to say was could you imagine a midfield trio of hendo, milner at the base and gerrard bombing forward or even on the right of a front 3? gerrard is a timeless type of player and in his prime would excel in this day in age. he had everything, really, pace, power, fitness, technique, passing, shooting, tackling...maybe his weakest attribute was his position and discipline, but that's what made him such a special player in so many ways. 

anyways, i digress, the real reason for the original point, in our current team, an in form, in his prime gerrard would likely be the difference between a top 4 finish/title run. 

for now would take masch and alonso, but then again, milner and hendo are different types of players. hendo and milner will run all day, press til the opponent suffocates and have quality enough to make a killer pass, surging run into the box, etc...i still stand by my point that hendo milner are far more dynamic than masch alonso, but as you said, great technique overcomes all of that.

null,null,Blubbey,null,null,null,"Tottenham are in talks with Bayer Leverkusen over an £18m deal for their forward Heung-Min Son, according to Sky sources.

Sky Germany understands that the 23-year-old is in London to undergo a medical.

Son was due to play for Bayer on Wednesday in their Champions League qualifying second leg tie against Lazio but it is understood the player will not be part of the squad.

Tottenham have had reservations about making a third bid for West Brom striker Saido Berahino and have been exploring other options.

Son impressed in his 38 appearances for Leverkusen last season and featured as they made the knockout stages of the Champions League.

He is a South Korea international with 44 caps and 11 goals and joined the Bundesliga side from Hamburg two years ago. 

By Lyall Thomas, the same person who said [this](https://twitter.com/SkySportsLyall/status/636550076496789504) earlier:


&gt;Hueng-Min Son is of interest to Spurs but nothing official happening yet. He's currently ill so not travelling anywhere today certainly.""

Leasing also requires you to be more pro active then most for paintwork care. Any marks on the bodywork or windshield need fixing whether your fault or not.
