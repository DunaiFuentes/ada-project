Raise it anyway - just request the policy from HR, read through it.  If you believe that what you're being targeted for is unfair, then you can raise a grievance.

Take a good look at the situation.  If you are being a stroppy, nasty twat to people, not completing tasks assigned (regardless how crap you think they are) then the chances are, your grievance won't be upheld, if they can demonstrate specific incidents of your generally twattiness.  Yes, you might not be one of the corporate drones, but they don't want individual thinkers, they want people to smile, even as Customer X vomits over your shoes.

If, on the other hand, you're doing everything right, you're doing well, are generally liked and are performing well, yet Person B is mistreating you, then your grievance will be upheld.

TL;DR: If you honestly believe you are in the right, raise it, fight it.  If you know you've done things that get up people's ass, leave it. If the place is poisonous, get out of it.

In engineering they're normally either the third year of a four year course (a so-called ""sandwich"" course), or a few months each of the first three years of a four year course (a ""thin sandwich"", which is what I was on before I dropped out). Students who don't find placements get kicked out. Of course, the university helps students find placements, and those placements are usually paid.

Generally the placements will be with the same company every year for a thin sandwich, and won't just be work, it's training worked out in conjunction with the university and the relevant professional body (eg IET / IMechE). Students will often be paid a small bursary from the company to support them during their time at the university, as well as getting a salary when they're on a work placement. Those bursaries usually come with a contractual commitment to accept a job on graduation if one is offered.

It's a pretty sweet deal for the student IMO.

AFAIK they were. FWIW America used to (and possibly still do) maintain a squadron of nuclear armed bombers constantly in the air. Having live nukes on aircraft was never a concern for them. 

Popular culture has severely polluted our minds about the cold war. In almost every single instance the NATO forces were the ones upping the ante and being the most provocative. Sorry, but that's the historical reality of it. There was no ""goodie"" in that movie.

So if you take illness to be about the *absence* of life then it's not necessarily something that's created as such, rather just the absence of another thing. You could say the same with light and darkness, darkness is just the absence of light.

&gt; Isn't this exactly the thing you would come up with if you were trying to impose control on a primitive society? You would tell them that, yes, in life bad and good things happen, but that in the end the good people will be rewarded and the bad punished.

Yes I guess so, but also it doesn't mean it's *necessarily* wrong.

CS Lewis talks about how humans have this insatiable appetite for wider social justice that goes beyond what we might expect if we supposed to purely looking out for our own self interest. He wonders if, like our appetite for food corresponds with the existence of food, you could wonder if our appetite for justice corresponds with the existence of justice.  I guess something like that fits within a wider framework of belief, rather than something you can prove independently.

&gt; Or if we get the same reward, why did they need that pain and I didn't?

Well this is an even bigger topic but Jesus tells a story where several people work on a farm but the farmer only asks some of them near the end of the day, then when they finish they all get paid the same. The people who worked though the heat of the day complain that they got the same pay but the farmer says ‘*I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn’t you agree to work for a [days pay]?

Devineman said we could buy any one of hundreds of younger, better HG goalkeepers for very little money - so obviously there is more to it - he's pretty much a coach and mentor to Hart, he has value to the squad. 

Also you don't need x HG players in the first place, you just cant have more than 17/25 non-HG players. No one has any HG players as passengers to fill the squad for those reasons. 

Anyway because it was Devineman he got downvoted and the other guy got up voted, and it was so ridiculous he quit. I can't blame him, it's similar to how McDiablo quit because any comment he made was downvoted just because _he_ said it.

1. To complete your Bachelor's degree you have to pass each year of your course, which is between 3-4 years based on the subject you choose.

2. I am graduating in July, however, I will have finished all my coursework and exams by the end of May.

3. 70+ = 1st
60-69 = 2:1
50-59 = 2:2
40-49 = 3rd
35-39 = pass
anything below = fail

4. This will depend on your course, for most internships are optional but I would highly recommend doing one as they build you CV and experience outside of university. Internships are usually a whole year long, although they can be a few months and can be paid or unpaid depending on the company.

It is absolutely possible to make money using active management, I don't think anybody would argue against that, and a number of our clients are happy to take the gamble that an active manager will outperform. 

An ongoing fee of 1% is pretty high, particularly for significant levels of investment, and ultimately the adviser should be guided by the client - I have a number of academics as clients who want 100% passive (obviously my preferred allocation anyway!), and it would be a waste of breath for somebody to try to extol the virtues of active management.

I'd have thought you'd be able to do all the same things with a 25Mbps connection.

For me the most important thing is a decent ISP with low-latenecy, so that webpages load in a fraction of a second instead of 1 or 2.

When it comes to big downloads, TV and videos, I can download [multigigabyte HD videos in 10 or 20 minutes](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2gb+%2F+35Mbps) on my 40Mbps connection, but it still takes 1½ hours to watch them.

The same applies to streaming of Netflix and stuff - my connection would allow 5 people to each watch a different 5GB movie over a 1½ hour period.

Having done the maths I can see maybe you'd want a bit more than 25Mbps, to allow for buffering and lag-free gaming, but I doubt it's frequent that everyone in your house is actually streaming hi-def video simultaneously (and if just one person isn't using the net, then that's a 25% extra overhead for everyone else).

I'd say the biggest problem with consumer broadband in this country is how everyone focusses in the headline speed, then most people buy their service from the cheapest shittiest ISP (with poor infrastructure, tech support &amp;c) and then complains when their service is shitty. *Well, no wonder!

a guy i knew at uni was doing his phd on how the european water supply has so many chemicals leached into it from shampoos and other household products that are causing hormonal effects and changes to the water supply, to fish, and by extension to us.

Its having as strong an effect on men as the birth control pill has on women. 

And there's currently not any easy to screen the water filtration systems for the xeno-oestrogen creating compounds.

The whole narrative is based on things that you can't possibly know and that often contradict what people have said about it publicly. The entire backbone of your story is essentially that everyone intimately connected with the situation is making everything up and you and Gary Neville know what really happened. 

A) Martinez has said that Baines normally takes penalties but also points out that they have a number of people in the squad that take them. Calling it ""team orders"" is something that you can't possibly have any knowledge of. 

B) Martinez did not sub him because of the penalty incident. He subbed him because of a tight hamstring. But I suppose he just made that up, right? Compelling argument.

Everton may be shit this year, but Martinez is not a sentimental fool. Mirallas is their best attacker and in great form. He was not subbed out of a match that Everton needed goals in because he missed a penalty he shouldn't have taken. 

And you know what, even if everything is exactly as you say (and to be clear, it isn't), I don't care, I'd still have him. You'd have a hard time building a squad if you completely rule out a player who did something selfish that hurt the team.

Arabic is spoken in 25 different countries, ranking it as the third highest in the world in terms of spoken countries (after English and French, with Spanish being fourth).

 Check out /r/learn_arabic or an Arabic course on www.memrise.com

I also suggest that you start by learning to pronounce the Arabic alphabet. It is much easier than Asian alphabets since it is based on only 28 letters.

In my opinion, there are 4 not necessarily ""needs,"" but positions/areas that could be strengthened. We could use a center back who can rotate with JT, who is experienced enough, but also relatively young. We could use a 3rd CM who can cover both roles of Matic and Fabregas in one. And in all likelihood I'm guessing Drogba will either retire/move to MLS before he comes back as a coach eventually, so we'll need a 2nd/3rd choice striker who has similar style to Drogba. A somewhat lesser need is a 4th winger for depth purposes, who is solid enough to play for us, but won't necessarily be unhappy should we not have playing time for him. 

- Neven Subotic - CB/Borussia Dortmund - Subotic has had a dip in form this year and has been displaced by Sokratis. With BvB also having promising centre back Matt Ginter who's 20, they may look to move on for Subotic, he only has one year left on his deal, and we may be able to snag him for cheap. Subotic is Serbian, and we already have 2 Serbian players on the team in Ivanovic, and Matic, so that could intrigue him to make the move. At 6-4, he also keeps the ridiculous height we have on this team, and he is a good decent threat. Subotic is 26, but still very experienced in Europe, having been a starter for BvB when they reached the final and made a unbelievable game-saving clearance in the final vs. Bayern. Check this shit out. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbEEf7lYwLs

- Andre Ayew - Winger/Marseille - Ayew is available on a free transfer this year as his deal with Marseille expires in the summer. Ayew is a pacey winger who is a very adept dribbler, likes to cut inside, and puts in a great shift defensively, in particular is great at making tackles. He's also a great aerial threat as well, although one weakness is he's not great at providing width as he isn't a very good crosser. Still he'd be great as a 4th winger, for free.

- Radja Nainggolan - CM/Roma - As has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread, Nainggolan could be the perfect 3rd CM for Mourinho because of his ability to cover both Matic and Fabregas's positions. He has an excellent work rate with great stamina, and is an aggressive tackler, but also good on the ball and reads the game well enough to be an adequate replacement for Fabregas. He can also blast it from 18 yards out which is something we've been lacking from our CMs ever since Lampard left. As far as availability goes, it's kinda tricky. Roma has 4 very good midfielders for only 3 positions, and the other 2 have been linked to moves away. Pjanic as the successor to Gerrard, Strootman to reunite with van Gaal at United. If we wanted to get Nainggolan we'd have to strike before either one of those deals happen, as I doubt Roma would give up more than one of their very good midfielders, they're not exactly a small club that needs to cash in on their player. If we can't get Nainggolan I'd like to have van Ginkel stay and train with the squad and get some opportunities, I think he can be excellent cover for Fabregas. 

- Christian Benteke - ST/Aston Villa - Speaking of Belgians, I like Benteke as a possible 2nd/3rd choice striker replacement for Drogba. Benteke's form has gradually dropped since his breakout first year at Aston Villa, but I believe that works to our advantage in getting him, especially with Villa hovering only 3 points clear of the relegation zone. I believe part of his struggles recently are at least due to his teammates around him, and he could be better off at a bigger club with world class players around him. As far as his style goes, he's incredible in the air, very strong, with the ability to shoot from long distance, past 18 yards. He leaves a bit to be desired in his hold up play, but I think that can be improved, he's still only 24. He doesn't contribute much defensively by pressing though, and he's not exactly the most disciplined individual either, that red card against who was it, I think Spurs, comes to mind. Either way, still definitely good enough to be a backup striker for us and plays a similar style to Drogba, and he's not a cunt like Icardi. 

The swing for the fences transfer:

- Luka Modric, CM/Real Madrid - This is a longshot, but I figure it's worth mentioning since 99% of the world seems to think that Paul Pogba is going to Real Madrid at the end of this year/next year, unless Juve make an extremely deep run in Champions League. Even then he still will probably go. If Real do buy Pogba, somebody has to be let go, and it would most likely be Modric as he's 29. Mourinho loves Modric, he purchased him while he was at Real, and *reportedly* (don't know if this is true, just saw it) called him and tried to convince him to come to Chelsea this past summer, before Modric told him he was happy at Real, and we moved onto Fabregas.  What's better than having one Fabregas? Having 2. Modric is very similar to Fabregas in that he is a deep lying playmaking midfielder with exceptional vision and puts in a good shift defensively. He's a little different than Fabregas though, in that he's stronger on the ball with more pace, and also he has the ability to blast it from 18 yards out unlike any of our other mids, which is something I said earlier, we've been lacking ever since Lampard left. With Modric, we could play more of the 4-3-3 that I think he prefers, or even 4-1-4-1 with Matic in more of a holding role further back. Would be a great buy, but a longshot at best. 

Another name I was thinking of adding in would be Kwadwo Asamoah, a winger from Juventus, who can also play in central midfield and left back, kind of a utility player, with great work rate, tireless energy, very pacey and good on the ball, puts in an amazing shift defensively, and who's pretty decent in the final third with the final ball, although is finishing is not great. Only reason I didn't add him though is I don't think he'd be available as I believe to my knowledge, we was starting for them before he got injured, and probably will once he gets back because I hear that Patrice Evra has been shit for them. 

Also, if (and sadly I think he will) Cech leaves at the end of the season, we'd need a new No. 2 GK to replace him with. For this I'd suggest Julio Cesar from Benfica, Jose's worked with him before at Inter Milan, he's good enough to be our No. 2, but also old enough to where he won't mind being a No. 2 and getting limited time.

His two management jobs prior to us (Watford and Gillingham) were absolute failures, losing 22 matches in 35 with the Gills and leaving Watford rooted to the bottom of division 1, so there was a lot of confusion as to how he managed to get a job in the premier league.    
His first year in charge was surprisingly decent, with us finishing 7th, but there was a few occasions that our limited gameplay was exposed and we were torn apart, losing 7-1 to Blackburn and 5-0 to Everton are just two examples.    
Second season syndrome hit him hard, with us spending the first two-thirds of the season rooted to the bottom, and despite a late fight, we were relegated. This was with a team featuring the likes of Joe Cole, Michael Carrick, Jermain Defoe, Fred Kanoute, Glen Johnson, David James and Paolo Di Canio.    
He had a very public spat with Di Canio, and dropped him out of the squad for the last half of the season, a time when the club legend was desperately needed.

null,false,rydleo,null,null,null,"There are two costs associated with players (generically, there are many others as well)- amortization of their purchase price across their contract length (e.g. a £20M purchase over 4 years is listed financially as a £5M cost each year) and their salary.

For wages, near as I can recall, that has went up every year since FSG bought the club.  For FY 2012/2013 (the most recently released records), our wage bill was £130.8M.  For FY 2011/2012, the wage bill was £109.2M, although to be fair this was only for 10 months (we changed our FY that year), so normalized across 12 months it would have been a very small difference.  As to whether the wage bill has gone up or done since May 2013, I really don't know.  The club will release financial statements covering June 2013-May 2014 in March, so we'll have a much better idea then, but it wouldn't surprise me to see it have gone up yet again.  I would also note that this financial report to be released will not include the sale of Suarez as that didn't happen until this current FY (the finances are nearly a year old by the time we see them in the public).

For the other piece, the amortization will almost certainly have gone up.  If you look at Suarez, he had a few years left on his contract and we bought him for ~£23M.  So, his cost on that side of the financials was like £3M-4M or thereabouts, whereas we just bought a ton of players for a lot of money, which adds quite a lot every year in terms of costs.  So, for this FY, we'll have a nice cash injection from Suarez, we didn't 'spend' £100M+, but like £30M or something, so the club will likely look very healthy this current FY.  The problem is the next one we won't have the Suarez cash but are still going to have the £30M cost of the new players.

A bigger issue I think people tend to overlook is as of May 2013, the club owed UKSV ~£69M.  At some point, the owners are going to want some of their money back and I suspect they'll want it sooner rather than later as otherwise they may be forced by UEFA to convert that debt into equity which I don't imagine they'll be thrilled to do.

Overall, the club's financial situation is okay-ish, but our debt levels are way too high right now and we're approaching H&amp;G levels again which I don't personally like to see.  Wages are fine, our amortization is probably too high, but in general I'd say we're in more or less sell to buy mode and unfortunately we don't have a great deal of assets of any significant value to sell.  Dropping out of the CL early in particular will really have cost us a great deal of money and not being in it next year (which seems entirely possible) will be painful as there is near nothing we can do commercially that would replace that sort of revenue potential.",null,0,null,1422643678,null,0,false,0,co5yudw,null,t3_2u7pbo,null,t1_co5yudw,null,t1_co5xyl6,null,null,null,1424302977,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

But specifically, in the initial scenario it describes, businesses which private citizens are unable to run anymore due to retiring or being dead. This is pretty clearly something being put in place to stop those situations where, say, the only hardware store in a small town closes because the owner becomes too ill to continue, with government stepping in to support the workers in keeping the business going as a workers co-op or a partially state run affair. Certain businesses can often be very important to communities and their closure will have a large knock-on effect. Also, from the point of view of 'the tax payer' keeping businesses open, people employed and cash flowing is in almost all cases much better for the public purse. Also, establishing legal pathways through which something *can* happen is very different from some nightmare scenario where jackbooted thugs come and steal everyone's stuff.

null,false,jsmith65,null,null,null,"Dr. William Lane Craig on this Problem: (full article [here](http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-problem-of-evil))

&gt;There’s no reason to think that God and evil are logically incompatible. There’s no explicit contradiction between them. But if the atheist means there’s some implicit contradiction between God and evil, then he must be assuming some hidden premises which bring out this implicit contradiction. But the problem is that no philosopher has ever been able to identify such premises. Therefore, the logical problem of evil fails to prove any inconsistency between God and evil.

&gt;You see, the atheist presupposes that God cannot have morally sufficient reasons for permitting the evil in the world. But this assumption is not necessarily true. So long as it is even possible that God has morally sufficient reasons for permitting evil, it follows that God and evil are logically consistent. And, certainly, this does seem at least logically possible. Therefore, I’m very pleased to be able to report that it is widely agreed among contemporary philosophers that the logical problem of evil has been dissolved. The co-existence of God and evil is logically possible.

&gt;But we’re not out of the woods yet. For now we confront the probabilistic problem of evil. According to this version of the problem, the co-existence of God and evil is logically possible, but nevertheless it’s highly improbable. Now this is a much more powerful argument, and therefore I want to focus our attention on it. In response to this version of the problem of evil, I want to make three main points: (each point is explained in detail in the full article [here](http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-problem-of-evil) which I highly recommend you read)

&gt;1. We are not in a good position to assess the probability of whether God has morally sufficient reasons for the evils that occur. As finite persons, we are limited in time, space, intelligence, and insight.

&gt;2. The Christian faith entails doctrines that increase the probability of the co-existence of God and evil. In so doing, these doctrines decrease any improbability of God’s existence thought to issue from the existence of evil. What are some of these doctrines? Let me mention four: 1. The chief purpose of life is not happiness, but the knowledge of God. 2. Mankind is in a state of rebellion against God and His purpose. 3. The knowledge of God spills over into eternal life. This life is not all there is. 4. The knowledge of God is an incommensurable good. To know God, the source of infinite goodness and love, is an incomparable good, the fulfillment of human existence. The sufferings of this life cannot even be compared to it.

&gt;3. Relative to the full scope of the evidence, God’s existence is probable. Let me mention three pieces of evidence: 1. God provides the best explanation of why the universe exists instead of nothing. 2. God provides the best explanation of the complex order in the universe. 3. God provides the best foundation for the existence of objective moral values in the world.

&gt;But that takes us to the emotional problem of evil. I think that most people who reject God because of the evil in the world don’t really do so because of intellectual difficulties; rather it’s an emotional problem. They just don’t like a God who would permit them or others to suffer and therefore they want nothing to do with Him. Theirs is simply an atheism of rejection. Does the Christian faith have something to say to these people?

&gt;It certainly does! For it tells us that God is not a distant Creator or impersonal ground of being, but a loving Father who shares our sufferings and hurts with us. Prof. Plantinga has written,

&gt;&gt;As the Christian sees things, God does not stand idly by, coolly observing the suffering of His creatures. He enters into and shares our suffering. He endures the anguish of seeing his son, the second person of the Trinity, consigned to the bitterly cruel and shameful death of the cross. Christ was prepared to endure the agonies of hell itself . . . in order to overcome sin, and death, and the evils that afflict our world, and to confer on us a life more glorious that we can imagine. He was prepared to suffer on our behalf, to accept suffering of which we can form no conception.

&gt;You see, Jesus endured a suffering beyond all comprehension: He bore the punishment for the sins of the whole world. None of us can comprehend that suffering. Though He was innocent, He voluntarily took upon himself the punishment that we deserved. And why? Because He loves us. How can we reject Him who gave up everything for us?

&gt;When we comprehend His sacrifice and His love for us, this puts the problem of evil in an entirely different perspective. For now we see clearly that the true problem of evil is the problem of our evil. Filled with sin and morally guilty before God, the question we face is not how God can justify Himself to us, but how we can be justified before Him.

&gt;So paradoxically, even though the problem of evil is the greatest objection to the existence of God, at the end of the day God is the only solution to the problem of evil. If God does not exist, then we are lost without hope in a life filled with gratuitous and unredeemed suffering. God is the final answer to the problem of evil, for He redeems us from evil and takes us into the everlasting joy of an incommensurable good, fellowship with Himself.

This IS NOT a new criticism and has been thought about for thousands of years by some of the greatest church thinkers to have ever lived.

It would certainly be fairly practical, I'd think, with a modern-day setting, which would be relatively cheap and easy to do.  

Of course, it does run the risk of re-treading Torchwood, and potentially fall into the ""only invasions and mad scientists"" issue that some pointed out in the '70s when Pertwee was exiled on Earth, but I'd still think there is plenty of mileage. 

Modern UNIT is a science led organisation, but you can be sure that some of the old school personnel will think that a more hawkish approach is still necessary.

Although Kate may be in charge, therefore, we’d have a pro-military 2IC to highlight that tension. Colonel Brimicomb-Wood from BF's *Sympathy for the Devil* would be brilliant for this - but that casting could cause a few problems... 

For the audience to identify with, I guess a new recruit, who would be at the raw edge of most operations, and could explore the new relationship that they develop there. 

For season 1 only, I’d make it explicit when the show is set and get Osgood in as we saw her in DotD. We, as the audience, know that she’s going to die, and can watch the time tick by as things are going well for her, she is sorting out her relationship with her sister and finds out some vital secret that she is just waiting for the right time to tell…

Of course, at that point there would still be the Zygons to deal with, and are Zygons the only undercover problem? C19 is a thing of the past now, surely?

It would be good if we could incorporate BF's Ruth Matheson and Charlie Sato somehow, from the Angel Vault, into the rest of the team, and maybe get Mike Yates back in a cameo here and there.

So, here’s a few suggestions for season 1:
 
1. **Quake** – When a London underground train arrives at a *very* different station following an earth tremor, and something else crawls out of the tunnel on the Circle Line instead, UNIT gets involved, even while the team can’t really trust who or what is standing next them.

2. **Legacy of the Zygons** – The team finally have chance to rid themselves of the Zygons, but are all Zygons as bad as they seem. 

3. **H.E.R.O.** – During the cold war, the UK had a super-soldier program. What became of the results?

4. **Earth Lights** – Britain’s ley lines are coming to life. 

5. **Undertow** – A north sea oil rig goes missing. They’re back. It was always just a matter or time.   

6. **Legion** – A Roman army unit is surrounding a hill fort owned by the National Trust. When UNIT responds they find themselves arriving two millennia too early.
 
7. **Quis Custodiat** – London is plagued by rogue micro-drones. There is something in the Vault that would deal with them, but do they dare use it?
 
8. **Zero Day** – The UNIT team find themselves alone on the planet.  

9. **Double Time** – The team need to retrieve an artefact from their own lab – but in the 1970s.

10. **Internal Affairs** – Not all alien menaces are humanoid, or human sized. With a nano-invasion underway, the team’s loyalty comes under scrutiny from elsewhere too.
 
11. **Pendulum** – Was that grandfather clock there all the time? 

12. **Endgame** – UNIT receives a tip-off. Something is going on at St Pauls...

Lacazette, Dybala, Icardi, Firmino. There are 4 young forwards we should be going for. All 4 are realistic targets. If we pay $5m for Ings on 30-50k a week, that's $5m less we have to go for one of these and a decent chunk of the wage budget.

Edit: 

&gt;10 goals a season from your third or fourth choice striker is doing ok tbh

Another point is that we shouldn't be in the market for a 4th choice striker. We should be buying a 1st choice one. Sturridge can't play every game (or any this season).

If McCarthy is fit it'll more likely be Barry who starts than Mo, but seeing as we're hoping.

I'd put Naismith on the starting line-up only I'd rather him coming on as a sub if we're down. Barkley rarely makes a difference if he comes on late. Seems he needs to be involved from the beginning to get a good flow to his game. 

Koné and Atsu as the other two subs, obviously depending on what we need. I just hope to fuck Bobby doesn't start Distin. His play doesn't give me the erection that Stones' does.

While there is concern about high levels of income inequality in the UK, analysis by the
Institute for Fiscal Studies think­tank suggests the squeeze on wages has been more acute at
the top than the bottom. It also shows that men have fared worse than women and the young
worse than the old.
Jonathan Cribb, the author of the IFS research, said the decline in earnings inequality since 2011 was a
surprise because analysts had thought the low­paid were suffering disproportionately.
While the weekly real wages of lower­paid employees fell faster immediately after the 2008 crash, data
from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings show the pattern has reversed since 2011 with the result
that weekly earnings inequality was slightly smaller in 2014 than in 2008.
The trend is stronger in hourly pay rates: real hourly wages fell 3.3 per cent between 2008 and 2014 at
the 10th percentile (10 per cent of employees earned less than this) and 6.4 per cent at the 90th
percentile (90 per cent of employees earned less than this).
Mr Cribb said there were no obvious explanations. The minimum wage rose faster than the median wage
in cash terms between 2011 and 2014, which could help to explain why lower­paid workers suffered relatively less in that period. But it
does not explain why well­paid workers saw bigger wage cuts than people in the middle. The figures exclude the self­employed, a
growing group that accounts for about 15 per cent of the workforce.
Inequality in pay is not the same as overall income inequality, which also includes the impact of taxes and benefits. Official data show
income inequality fell after the crisis, but most economists think it will start to rise in the next few years.
The IFS also found that real median hourly wages fell 7.3 per cent for men between 2008
and 2014, but just 2.5 per cent for women. That is partly because women are much more
likely to work in the public sector, where pay has been more insulated.
That trend is changing, though: private sector wages are starting to recover while the
government squeezes public sector pay as part of its efforts to reduce the budget deficit.
The young have also fared much worse than older workers. The real hourly wages of
employees aged 60 and older have already recovered to 2008 levels, while the wages of
employees aged 22 to 29 are still 9 per cent lower.
The coalition government has emphasised the fact that employees who have stayed in the
same full­time job have seen their average real pay increase — even as earnings across the
workforce have fallen.
But the IFS said that was “not new or surprising” because pay tends to rise with age.

You go to secondary school, and THEN go to Sixth Form OR College.

Also, ""FE College"" and ""College"" are the same thing.

""Further Education"" is both Colleges and Sixth Form. It refers to the **level** of education offered at the institute.
In the sense that you get:

- Primary Education at Primary Schools.

- Secondary Education at Secondary Schools.

- **Further Education at Sixth Forms and Colleges.**

- Higher Education at Universities.

Both Colleges and Sixth Forms offer the same level of qualifications (Level 3 Quals)

The difference is that Sixth Forms tend to be more academic (A Levels for example), whilst colleges are more vocational (BTECs/NVQs/C&amp;G... etc)

Sixth Forms are not always attached to schools. It's just that it's most likely that if a school wanted to offer FE provision, they would start a Sixth Form rather than a college.

Tomorrow will be different, because knowing Mou, we will go defensive since even if we lose we'll be top. So, i expect Mou to concentrate on not losing the 5 point lead rather than getting the 8 point lead. In these kinds of matches, Cahill is usually immense.

It's not rude to use a word that means the same as another word to describe something. It's ridiculous and rude to complain that people aren't using the right synonym and to whine about how superior you are for using the word you prefer. And doubtless you'd whine just as much at an American who used ""pitch"" rather than field, complaining that we're trying to appropriate your culture. Clearly you're just an angry person who picks fights like these to feel better about himself. 

I didn't ""adopt"" soccer any more than you did. I started playing 30 years ago, watching grainy VHS tapes of Pele shortly thereafter and off I went. That's how being a fan works. It took a little longer to acquaint myself as we didn't get highlights until the 90s, matches in the 00s. But so what? I like the sport. You like the sport. Who cares who has liked it longer, who has watched more games (excuse me, matches or ties)?

If we blow our budget on 1 player we end up woefully off balance and suffer from the same kind of shit that's plagued us this season.

This doesn't account for outgoing players and how that money could be used of course, and I expect a lot of players leaving in the summer: Aspas, Borini, maybe Balotelli, Johnson on a free but his wages matter, possibly Jones or Mignolet depending on the keeper we bring in, Gerrard's already gone on a free but the wages are important, Alberto, maybe Ilori.  I don't think we'll be getting much for any of them, but overall it could combine into a nice chunk of money.

We can't just go out and drop 8 figures on 3-4 players though and there's no way our net spend crosses 30mil again this coming summer (I'd be shocked to see it even come near 30mil to be honest).  We're already under intense scrutiny for FFP and this past summer will have jumped up our amortized player costs tremendously.  If we get in 2 really top level players next summer and don't break ourselves for FFP it'll be pretty impressive.  It's probably possible, but it'll be a matter of the right players being available and at the right time in their contracts/their owning club's disposition that we can get them at the right prices.  We can't pay the premiums to just bring in players like Chelsea/United/PSG/Real/etc.

&gt;Press statement

The following statement has been issued to any enquiries relating to Stan Lock.

‘I do not favour speaking publicly about individual students or their families and will not do so now.

Churchill Academy and Sixth Form have held a firm line against those who decide to flout our behaviour policies for many years - it is only by doing this can we uphold our standards and make sure we are fair to all.

This incident isn’t the first and won’t be the last of this nature. In the past parents have approached us about stunts to raise money for charity and we have been able to advise and work with them to avoid any difficulty. At times, some parents do not do this and do not advise their children of potential problems.

Isolation is one of the consequences for students that break our behaviour policies. My stance is to review when someone is able to take their place again in the mainstream of our learning community – this I will do in these circumstances and this will be based on discussions with the student.

Speaking generally, there are many ways to raise money for charity - most we will support; rushing into a particular way without thought is always likely to cause consequences. Some people wish to avoid consequences by blaming others - I think this sends a poor message to young people. I have consistently held this stance and parents, generally, know we set high standards. That's why we expect them to have a dialogue with us before they allow their child to do something they may regret.’

I usually tend to get vague answers like this when I push this topic with Christians and always wonder if they truly believe what they're saying or if it's an attempt to rationalise something they themselves cannot understand.

&gt;It means we can't say good things happen to good people and bad things to bad, but there is an understanding that, while we should work for Justice, God will ultimately make all things right in the end.

What can be made right in the afterlife for a baby which dies in childbirth? My brother has an extra chromosome. Is God going to make amends somehow in the afterlife?

If you take illness to be the absence of life, what happens to the theory when that illness is caused by a mechanism (evolution) which God can only have designed himself. To deny that mechanism would be to deny humanity's relationship with God. 

Is that mechanism flawed because it results in mutations with negative traits? Has God created something imperfect? Is it intentional? If so why? If he has the ability to make things right in the end, why create the problems in the first place?

The existence of God is circular and illness is not about the absence of life.

At the moment it is mostly used to penalise venues that don't refuse service and as a result produce those who end up in a cell or A&amp;E due to alcohol related incidents.

The venues are complying with breathalysing because it gives them a stronger case to refuse entry to those who are intoxicated and because incidents requiring the police or an ambulance are recorded and considered when the licence renewal comes up.

I'm sure there are venues that have declined but you can bet that when they petition the council for licence renewal their unwillingness will be noted and if they have had a higher rate of emergency services call outs they will run the risk of losing their licence.

Say there's a particularly nasty alcohol related incident in a venue that declined to take part the police have the power to close it on the spot and the council will temporarily revoke the alcohol licence until they comply with whatever conditions are set (by the council). Fabric had to allow sniffer dogs in the queue before they got their licence approved following headlines about drug deaths.

They can also check your kidney function with a blood test if you are worried about that.

Your GP can contact the urologist and get you seen sooner if it is necessary.

Having a problem with your only kidney can be scary, especially if you don't fully understand the problem.

But… there are differences between Scottish Greens and English and Welsh Greens.

Scottish Greens have been in the Scottish parliament since 1999, with multiple members. During the last parliament we had seven members. That fell to two in this parliament, but in 2016 we expect to get a lot more. It is entirely possible that the Greens will end up as the second biggest party in Holyrood after the next Scottish elections. Certainly there’s a bigger than half chance we’ll end up as the third party. It all depends on how badly Labour will crash in 2015. If it’s really bad, then Labour could fall down to Conservative levels of support - at around 15 per cent. We’re already polling at ten-eleven per cent for Holyrood.

GPEW is, institutionally, where we were ten years ago. A little tiny party on the fringe where it didn’t really matter if some really kooky ideas ended up in the policy because it was inconceivable that the party would end up with any influence. Caroline Lucas is one MP in a sea of other MPs. Until now, what the party has done is a bit immaterial. They’ve not been scrutinised until now.

In addition to being in parliament, Scottish Greens just climbed down from a two year long campaign for independence where media scrutiny was, sometimes, very harsh. If we weren’t ignored because the media wanted to make it a two horse race between BT and the SNP. Our front line people are bloodied veterans by now. Patrick Harvie, in particular, shone in the campaign. He’s one reason why our membership exploded right after the referendum.

Whatever kooky ideas were in our manifesto before 2003 has been polished away by scrutiny and criticism. Both internal and external. Here, I get the impression that what goes in the manifestos and policy documents matter because we're not so fringe and marginal. That’s the impression I have. Crazy stuff like talking about terrorist groups when you want to make a point about freedom of thought would probably be quietly killed in conference.

I just worry that the GPEW will show so much inexperience that they’ll make life more difficult for us up here as well. I mean, someone will talk about “The Green Party” and some of the mud will fall on us too. I get the feeling that we’re only putting up a token campaign in 2015, and focus on the Scottish elections in 2016. Most Greens I know plan to vote SNP in 2015 and Green in 2016. But a bad showing for GPEW might trip that up.

And what's wrong with wanting out? Everton last won a game in December, and any hopes of making Europe is pretty much over for them. He has every right to jump ship, because he's hitting his prime and Martinez and the players around him are frustrating. 

&gt;he was trying to be the hero

Good. Besides Eriksen, Chadli and Kane, who else are our heroes in attack? Soldado? Ade? Lennon? 

&gt;Except baines, lukaku, naismith and presumably the coach were telling him to give it Baines.

Rumor also has it that players have lost confidence in Martinez.

Some people think this spells the end of our chances at signing Alex Song permanently. Personally, I'm not in this camp. I'm seeing something really interesting in West Ham's signings these last two windows: An abundance of DMs that can also play CM are now at the club. Kouyate is a DM. Song is a DM. Noble is DM. Fletcher is a DM. Poyet is a DM. I think Sam has told the board that he wants to play three DMs if we're going to play the diamond to make up for the 5 man midfields we'll see. If we play 3 DMs (particularly when all of our DMs are adept passers), we'll be able to hold off attacks and will play on the floor more often offensively. This means more attractive football.

null,false,suzych,null,null,null,"""Love is a promise"" does sound odd, but in context makes sense. It took me a while to figure out though, because the Doctor's next line was somehow obscured, not connected cleanly to the line before it.  He says ""Love is a promise"", we see CyberDan enclose Clara in a protective one-armed embrace, and the Doctor says, ""He will never hurt her,"" to which Missy, aghast, responds, ""No, it can't be!""

The ""promise"" is the promise to protect the beloved, even from one's own darker impulses.  CyberDan is *supposed* to kill Clara once his feelings have been suppressed; instead, he acts on this ""promise"" aspect of love (parents often state this to their children as, ""I won't let anything bad happen to you""), and once he has the control bracelet commands what is now *his* cyber-army to protect the living at the cost of their own lives.

All of this should be seen against the background of Remembrance Day (UK Memorial Day, right?), because what a nation's soldiers take an oath to do is to protect and defend their country -- which translates as ""love of country"".  The Doctor is correct in handing over command to not an officer but one soldier among many, who then orders them all to protect the living.  Authority over an army is returned to the army itself, where it can be used to mobilize that army to fulfill its oath of protection.  

Gorgeous, and satisfying.

Comparing him to Salah is laughable. Salah has shown nothing in his limited chances his 2 years to suggest some playing time, while Schurrle had a good last season and one poor half season after getting sick and not getting consistent playing time.

null,false,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,null,"&gt;  but Scots Gaelic originates from Irish colonisation of Scotland in the sixth century

Calling it a Colonisation is a bit of a stretch, especially by the standards of what was to come later.

&gt; The Picts lived mainly in eastern Scotland, north of modern Edinburgh. We know their homeland both from the distributions of Pictish place-names (which typically begin with ""Pett"" or ""Pit"") and the distribution of Pictish symbol stones, which were Pictish equivalents of a medieval coat of arms, each typically bearing the crest of a petty king and that of his father. The rugged west coast was only lightly occupied by Picts or some other Celtic-speaking people. Settlers from Dál Riata apparently established themselves along the west coast without much opposition. By A.D. 490 the population of Scotti was large enough that the head of the little kingdom moved the family seat across from Ireland. The Scotti alternately cooperated with and fought against the Picts for the next few centuries until the two were unified into a single kingdom under Cináed (Kenneth) mac Ailp’n in A.D. 844. ^[source](http://archive.archaeology.org/0107/abstracts/scotland.html)

What I mean is Christians believe that God is ultimately *the* source of life. The problem is when man turns his back on the source of life then death enters (in the same way that if you turn off the light, darkness enters). Illness and suffering are extensions of death, in the sense that they are symptoms of life malfunctioning. The Bible talks about the whole of creation groaning for presence of God.

It's not that we want illness, far from it. A basic Christian premise is that Humans have rebelled against God, Adam and Eve did it, all the biblical 'hero's' did it, Jesus's disciples left him, the Church abandons him and becomes a cold cultural artefact. When man turns away from God then darkness and death enter.

Also, it's certainly not a way to blame people for bad things that happen to them (like a Karma system). In fact some religious people ask Jesus whose sin is to blame for one mans illness and Jesus utterly rejects that line of thinking, it's more a general thing. Like reality has shifted to partially exclude God and therefore partially exclude life (which allows death in).

""League sources revealed today that current Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino is unhappy with his current appointment and that managing a football club is ""difficult,"" with many obstacles laying in his wake at any moment. He then expounded on his remarks by saying that he wishes he could work any job in the world before his current one, but lamented that being the manager at Tottenham ""is my job.""

Mauricio could not be reached for a follow-up comment hours later when we asked him if he'd rather lobotomize himself and eat his own dying brain tissue in front of his children than make just one more match-day decision at Spurs.

It is largely speculated that while Pochettino clearly hates his time at Spurs as well as himself for ever considering the job, he is not in any immediate danger of actually taking his own life. Former Spurs manager, journalist, critic/pundit, Youth team player and former spouse and life partner Harry Redknapp, however, has been placed under medical supervision as Tottenham Chairman Daniel Levy hasn't given so much as a whiff of attention to Redknapp in the midst of this crisis of leadership.""",null,0,null,1422657257,null,0,false,0,co679sg,null,t3_2u78z4,null,t1_co679sg,null,t3_2u78z4,null,null,null,1424299044,null,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7,null

Well right up until Blair the Labour Party had Clause IV:

&gt;To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.

But they didn't requisition factories and nationalise all industy did they?

There's a difference between the principles of a party - how it envisages an ideal world - and the policies it enacts in practice.

I must admit it's funny to see the neo-liberals argue against the free movement of labour and the 'hippie' types that protest WTO summits arguing for it...

Yes it is. We have a hectic schedule coming up soon, so of course it's important. You have to be a lobotomy patient to believe otherwise. 

&gt;I don't like that. You can reason around it and compare it to Kane taking a penalty over eriksen. It just was not the same at all.

Eriksen's our free kick taker just like Baines is their penalty taker. Kane got his in, where Mirallas didn't, so of course he'd be a hero where Mirallas is painted as a villain. If Mirallas hadn't missed, he'd be a confident talisman for them at present, just like what Kane is to us now.

Yeah, I did. It was probably a dick move, but what's wrong with being headstrong like he was against WBA? That decision wasn't Mirallas naturally being a dick, but came out of a shit atmosphere.

I don't believe you'll need to buy membership as others have suggested, purely on the basis my girlfriend simply registered on the phone and picked me up some cup tickets not too long ago. However I could very well be wrong. You can have tickets shipped to yourself or I believe you can pick them up on the day

Burnley away and Barca (home or away) you have no chance but do try to get tix for Leicester. You can buy them on the phone or online. 

If you do attend a match then you should bring warm clothes. Manchester is cold at the best of times and contrary to popular belief you'll actually be freezing at your seat. Usually I wear a sport base layer, thermal top, city shirt and a jacket. Sometimes I'm still cold but usually cause my jackets undone. Make sure you have change so you can pick up a program and bring a bit of extra cash for food/ a pint or two. To get here; travel to Mcr City centre and get the tram to the station. Trains are very reliable so long as there's no snow and you can book your travel way in advance.

Exclusive Rory Smith meets Andy Carroll, who returns to Anfield today for the first time since the Liverpool manager sold him to West Ham
Andy Carroll does not miss a beat. He has been asked to provide an illustration of how he knew, in the summer of 2012, that his Liverpool career was over, to describe precisely what it was that convinced him he and Brendan Rodgers could never work together. Straightaway, he accuses the Liverpool manager of lying.

“With Brendan Rodgers, there was a lot going on,” he says. From experience, it is safe to say that as an interviewee, Carroll does not do artifice and he does not do euphemism. He is markedly calm and casual as he describes his dark, final days at Liverpool.
“What he was saying to me and what was actually happening [were different things]. He was telling me one thing to my face, then I’d leave the training ground and he would ring me and tell me a completely different thing.

“He would say: ‘You’re going to play every week, you’re going to play every game up front with [Luis] Suárez’. I’d leave and get home and he would ring me and say: ‘Fulham and West Ham want you and I think it’s best you should go.’ I had just had a conversation with him ten minutes ago. So I would go back and see him and he would say the opposite again.

“It was the same thing round and round and round. On phone calls, it was: ‘I think you should go.’ To my face it was: ‘You’ll start every week’. It was mixed messages. He was messing with my head. I lost respect for him, to be honest.

“Another example: I went to Hearts for the [Europa League qualifier]. I got up there. He said I was starting. I woke up in the morning and he came in and said: ‘I think you’ve got a hamstring problem, you’re not going to start.’ I said my hamstring was fine. He said I’d be on the bench. I got to the ground and I wasn’t even on the bench. I was the only one missing out.

“It was just messing me about. I was angry. I knew it was time to go. I thought I just want to play football. I didn’t need this. Under Brendan I knew I was never going to play, with what he was saying to me.
“If he had said straightaway I wasn’t going to play, I’d have said fair enough, you’re a new manager, it’s your decision. You didn’t sign me, fair enough. He did it to a few other players, too, players who are not there now. I didn’t need to speak to anyone about it. I just knew it was a breakdown. If the manager is treating me like this, [I thought] there is no reason for me to be at Liverpool.”

Two and a half years on, Carroll returns to Anfield this afternoon as a West Ham player. Thanks to a combination of injuries and the terms of his initial loan move to Upton Park, it will be the first time he has been back to the club who, in 2011, made him the most expensive English player in history.

The accusations regarding his treatment by Rodgers have not been substantiated by the Northern Irishman. For Carroll, enough water has passed under the bridge for the 26-year-old to recount his dealings with his former manager with no real rancour. There is similarly no trace of bitterness in his voice as he discusses his feelings towards Liverpool as a whole. He is at his happiest now, he says, working under Sam Allardyce for a West Ham team he feels “is only going up”. He is over his injuries. He is allowing his thoughts, just a little, to drift towards further international recognition. Carroll is in a good place.
He does not give the impression, particularly, that he would join the modern fad of refraining from celebrating should he score against his former employers, but equally does not seem to have a burning desire for revenge. Returning to Liverpool, he says, is not the emotional drain that going back to Newcastle for the first time was.

“That was tough,” he says. “I grew up there, I had a season ticket there, I supported them for years and still do now. It was hard to hear your own fans getting on your back. I knew I would get some from the Newcastle fans. That was disappointing. I don’t know what I’ve done wrong, but obviously it’s something. There are some emotions with Liverpool, but it is not a team I grew up with. It was just a team I was at for a short time and I have moved on.”

His prime emotion when he thinks back to his time at Anfield, he says, is “more frustration than regret”. It may surprise him that there will be plenty in attendance today who share that view, and not simply because of the chronic shyness in front of goal of Rodgers’ side.
Carroll’s debut was a long time in coming. He had signed — on that bizarre night when Fernando Torres went to Chelsea — with an injury, and it was not until early March that he was ready to appear.
The intervening weeks had brought about a torrent of bafflement and mirth that the club’s American owners had sanctioned such a vast outlay on such a raw talent.

He first appeared as a substitute during a game against Manchester United. It was the perfect setting, really. Dirk Kuyt had scored a hat-trick but Suárez had been the star, teeing up all three, tormenting the hated enemy. The game was won. The mood was buoyant. Anfield was crowing. Then Carroll, the £35 million man, bounded on to the field. His first involvement was to contest a header from a Pepe Reina goal kick. He won it, emphatically. The sight was cheered as loudly as a goal.

“I can remember coming on and winning my first header,” he says. “The noise all kicked off. But I never really got a grip on being fit. The frustration is that I could not get myself going. I went there injured, I was rushing myself back to be fit because I wanted to play and they were rushing me back, too. That meant I would play one game, then miss two, then play another and so on. Then I’d be out and it was a snowball effect.”

Then, of course, out went Kenny Dalglish — who referred to him, affectionately, as “Big Andy” — and in came Rodgers, very much a Carroll-sceptic. The Northern Irishman’s belief, it seemed, was that his powerhouse centre forward suited only one type of game. He was a target man, a long-ball magnet, a heavyweight in a bantam world. Rodgers decided that his face did not fit.

This is the only point where Carroll, reclining in his seat at West Ham’s training ground, grows agitated. He has heard this accusation too many times and, though he insists that he is “not bothered by other people’s opinions,” it clearly strikes a nerve. Not least, perhaps, because it haunts him even now.

When Sam Allardyce’s side started the season playing quick, incisive football with Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia up front — thanks to Carroll’s injury — there was a worry around Upton Park that, once the striker returned, all that progress would be lost, that West Ham would revert to a less sophisticated style.

“We play in exactly the same way,” Carroll says. “I know we do, because the training is exactly the same, the way we set up. It is just perception. Because I am tall and win headers, people think the long ball must be back. We have probably hit the same amount of long balls with me up front as with anyone else. It doesn’t annoy me. It is just stupid. It is people not knowing the game.

“It has to be [scoring] a flying header that gives me most pleasure, but I am not just about that. I have a bit of everything: I can defend, I can attack, I’m good on the floor, I’m good in the air. People think if you’re tall and win headers, that’s all you are. That is my strength and you use your strength, but that doesn’t take away from what you can do on the floor. People don’t see that. They only see height.”
That, certainly, is all that Rodgers saw. Carroll returns to Anfield this afternoon not angry, not vengeful, but simply determined to open his eyes.

So, if you've got one candidate you want to put all your weight behind, you might want to try and indicate that to your voters, which is it what it looks like your local party were trying to do.

Also the only thing I'd add is that it's approaching a point where his injuries stop being an excuse for him not playing his best and just become a massive drawback. We can't rely on him if he's going to be injured every few weeks. Case in point being last month when we had no strikers. Jovetic came in for one week and got injured again. Before Bony we basically had 2 strikers, one of whom was Aguero and also injury prone. 

I like Jovetic but he is flattering to deceive mostly and regularly spurns easy chances and loses possession. I really want him to come good, but the longer it goes on the less likely it is he does start playing at his best - and the pressure/frustration seems to be getting worse.

For physical problems it's of less importance but for mental health faith can be of a great help to an individual and I don't dispute that, if it's used sensibly. 

I'm a Christian myself, who has mental health problems (you're welcome to make jokes :P) but I leave my medical problems to my GP and therapist. I don't expect them to offer spiritual help/solutions. I guess my general concern that a vulnerable person might be unable to say: 

&gt;""No thank you, I'd rather see a physchologist/therapist etc...""?

It's more of a concern I have than one based on evidence I admit.

3b. Consumption (M) = oN^0.5 - yN^2 and Graph that with some value of o and y, such as o=50 and y=3

To find the optimal value, the maxima needs to be found. This graph will always have 1 maxima and 0 minima, and the maxima occurs where gradient is 0.

dM/dN = o/(2N^0.5) - 2yN = 0

Rearranging that i'm not gona type out here

In that interview you are referring to, he was saying that past performance should be the number 1 reason to be picked for the first 11 or how he performed in the games.

Honestly you could say that Agger was getting complacent, and i understand why.

Downing has principles, too, which is why he was so offended by the public criticism he received from Brendan Rodgers during their time together at Liverpool.

For the son of an oil-rig worker who was taught from a young age that success can only be achieved through sheer hard graft, accusations of laziness - or a lack of commitment, to paraphrase Rodgers more accurately - are taken personally. Downing objected at the time and here the subject again comes up. ‘He (Rodgers) was the one manager I had problems with,’ he says. ‘I found it very difficult and the way it was handled - to come out in the papers and basically slag off your player by saying you don’t try - that was poor really.

‘If it’s a one-one-one conversation and he wants to grill me, I can take that. But when it’s open like that; I don’t understand why some managers do it. You can lose the player completely. Did he do it as a gee-up? Maybe, but I didn’t appreciate it. I got my head down, worked hard and got back in the team. I’ve always worked hard, probably because of the way I’ve been brought up. My dad would always remind me that football’s a short career and that you need to make the best of it.

‘That’s why I found what happened at Liverpool difficult. That kind of thing can tarnish a player’s reputation. If fans read that you don’t try, it gives the wrong impression. I was finding it hard after the first season I’d had at Liverpool. When that came out, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.’",null,0,null,1422663052,null,0,false,0,co6acm9,null,t3_2u8z6q,null,t1_co6acm9,null,t1_co6a7v0,null,null,null,1424297609,null,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4,null

My German is rusty, but I'll give translation a shot:

""The Last Emperor - in this issue, 11 Friends (11FREUNDE, the magazine) #159 an exit report about the Liverpool Legend Steven Gerrard, and naturally, much more.


""The TV reporter congratulated Gerrard on a job well done, and asked if he'd like to hear some messages from the supporters. Gerrard replied, sadly, 'Don't! It'll break me.'

""After 26 years, Gerrard is leaving the famous English club. Since the age of eight, he the shirt of the Reds, and described leaving as 'The hardest decision of my life.' When he's stayed at the club for so long, naturally Gerrard is lost for words. It was crystal clear that, for him, Liverpool FC wasn't just an employer.

""With the club, his myth and legend will always be intertwined with the clubs', and generations said his name in the same breath as Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, or John Barnes.

""He was a symbol, there is something about the modern footballer, that it doesn't stop at silver trophies and confetti.""

It's never a good idea to isolate or generally mess about with any of your staff.

As for Downing, some of the relevant pieces:

“I spoke to the manager and he said he wanted me to stay. So I’m disappointed that one minute I was staying and the next minute I’m gone,"" said Downing.

When asked if he was surprised to hear Rodgers' comments that he had been offered an 'incredible' deal at West Ham and wanted to leave because of it, he replied: “I don’t know about that.

‘He (Rodgers) was the one manager I had problems with,’ he says. ‘I found it very difficult and the way it was handled - to come out in the papers and basically slag off your player by saying you don’t try - that was poor really.'

‘After Liverpool it was good to be dealing with a straight-talking man.'

null,false,SabaYNWA,lfc99,null,null,"Daniel Sturridge has been talking with candour for the best part of an hour about all the subjects that you might expect: his anticipated comeback on Saturday against West Ham United, the “nightmare” of being injured, his “devastation” at Steven Gerrard’s imminent departure from Liverpool, why the club can still thrive in their captain’s absence and the truth behind public perceptions of Mario Balotelli.
But, just as the interview is drawing to a close, we stumble across a topic that provokes a visible transformation in his body language. Sturridge’s eyes have lit up, there is a big smile on his face and he is trying to put into words exactly how it feels to score a goal for Liverpool or England.
It is five long months since he has experienced this particular sensation. “There is nothing that compares,” he says. “It’s strange, you go home and it’s just like, ‘man’.” Sturridge lets off a sigh of excitement and then adds: “Doesn't matter what you do in life, you can’t re-create the feeling. I miss that feeling. It’s just the best feeling that I’ve ever had in my life.”
We are seated in a classroom at St Paul’s Catholic School in Liverpool but Sturridge’s mind is now three miles away in front of the Kop.
“If you play five-a-side and you score, it feels good, doesn’t it?” he says. “If I score a goal in training it feels great. But in a stadium, especially Anfield, or even when you score away and the fans are silent, it’s just amazing. You are just in the moment. There are times when I’ve scored and I can’t even remember what happened. It’s so good.”

It sounds almost like an out-of-body experience? “Seriously, you would just have to experience it to know what I mean,” he says. “Sometimes you are not conscious of it all and sometimes you just don’t even know what has happened. There are only certain times when I have realised and you can enjoy it and you can be there. Maybe it’s on your mind, thinking, ‘yeah, that was a decent feeling’ but afterwards you are straight back to work and you are just focused on trying to help your team win.”
The correlation between Sturridge scoring and his team winning is clear. He has scored 36 goals in 52 games for Liverpool and their win ratio falls from 61 to 52 per cent in his absence. You have to wonder, then, what might have been if Sturridge had succeeded in convincing Brendan Rodgers that he could have played in Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final second leg, even if the manager’s caution was understandable following his hamstring, calf and thigh injuries.

“I could have played in that semi-final, and it was the most difficult thing for me,” says Sturridge. “I went to London with the team. I wanted to push myself and I wanted it so bad. It was the management who made the decision. I argued my case, but at the end of the day they made the best decision for us going forward, for the club, for myself. I can’t be too upset with the decision they made.”
Sturridge is now desperate to look forward but part of that process also involves considering how much has changed in recent weeks.
Gerrard’s decision to leave Liverpool at the end of the season has inevitably sent shock waves through the dressing room as well as the wider football world. “Words can’t describe what he’s done for Liverpool as well as his country,” says Sturridge. “I’m devastated. I think he’ll be at the club in some capacity very soon and I’m sure he’ll manage the club one day.”
The departure of Gerrard will also further highlight Sturridge’s evolving status as one of the senior players and he believes that he has a “duty” to help Liverpool’s emerging talent, describing both Raheem Sterling and Jordan Ibe as like “younger brothers”.
Sturridge also knows how it feels to be at clubs in Chelsea and Manchester City who were less committed than Liverpool to giving young English talent their chance and, as Sterling continues contract negotiations, you have to wonder if there is a lesson in those experiences.

Sturridge is ""devastated"" by the departure of Steven Gerrard (GETTY IMAGES)
“As a young player I think it’s important to have people who talk to you,” says Sturridge. “I’m 25. I’m not old but I’m not a young, young player. It’s easy to become complacent when you are earning decent money as a young player. It’s important to understand that there is a lot to achieve and there is a long way to go before you are where you actually want to be.”
Last week Sturridge posted a picture on Twitter of himself and Mario Balotelli together alongside the message: “We’re gonna be linking up soon!!” Whether England and Italy’s respective World Cup No 9s can click on the pitch remains to be seen but they have become friends off it and Sturridge is adamant that wider perceptions of Balotelli are distorted. “Everybody judges a book by its cover,” he says. “I can look at 50 books and say every one of those books is bad. Then you read one and you can say, ‘this book is amazing’. That’s the same with meeting people.
“There are some characters in life, let alone football, who you see and it’s just the way they act in the heat of the moment. You can sit down and have a normal conversation with a lot of people and you’d be surprised what they have been through to get to where they are.
“Mario’s been really nice. I enjoy playing with him, I enjoy his company. People have made for him to be this crazy, wild character but he’s not that. I don’t believe that he is as wild as people think he is.”
Sturridge has also had to deal with perceptions that he would regard as unfair. He is active on social media and, after recent setbacks, is well aware that he will be accused of being injury-prone and fragile. “I could say a lot of things about people’s lifestyles,” he shrugs. “I feel that there are some players who are lucky not to be injured and some who are unfortunate to be injured. I know I get stick on social media but that is from people who have a lot of time on their hands and like to share their opinions.

Nothing can beat the feeling of scoring a goal, insists Sturridge (GETTY IMAGES)
“I go on there for my fans, who I enjoy talking to and are people who care about me. I am thankful for their support. I don’t worry about the criticism. I used to when I was younger. Now I only listen to the opinions of people I care about.
“I played in a long season with Liverpool and went to the World Cup, and that was the first season I played such an intense programme. I came back for pre-season and picked up an injury, which hindered everything going forward.”
Sturridge’s wider support structure has clearly been vital during his rehabilitation and he is adamant that he has used the past five months to make both physical and mental improvements. He does look visibly stronger in his upper body and he wants to approach the rest of his career with a new outlook. “This is just one small moment in my career,” he says. “I have got another 10 years, and I see this time as being something that will allow me to enjoy my career more, to get more out of it.
“Putting on a Liverpool shirt alone is huge for any individual. The great strikers that the club has had before, that’s pressure alone to live up to what they have done. For myself, I don’t worry about any of the expectancies because what I am dealing with now, hundreds have dealt with before. I don’t worry about scoring. I feel if you put pressure on yourself to do something, sometimes you don’t achieve it. Maybe the stresses you had before are not stresses any more. I’ll have a very different approach from now on.”

Sturridge claims Mario Balotelli is misunderstood by the public (GETTY IMAGES)
As he speaks about this approach, the perspective that he derives both from his family and Christian faith is obvious. It is also easy to sense the influence of Prof Steve Peters, a sports psychiatrist for Liverpool and England.
“I am trying to savour it a bit more,” says Sturridge. “I am very hard on myself the majority of the time and don’t enjoy the highs as I should. I’d score, may play well and just think, ‘OK, tick that off the list and on to the next’, but you have to embrace the moment. Being out for so long has also made me realise how much I want to achieve and understand what I have to do to get there.”
Sturridge says that the hardest moment, looking from the sidelines, was to see the club playing the likes of Real Madrid in the Champions League. Yet within that European campaign, and certainly since, both against Chelsea in the League Cup and in a sequence of just one defeat in 10 Premier League games, there are signs that last season’s fluency is being rekindled. Sturridge’s return should make a huge difference and he is adamant that, even without Luis Suárez, Liverpool can again qualify for the Champions League. Beyond that, and even without Gerrard, he believes that they can re-establish themselves amongst Europe’s elite.
“We saw the other night against Chelsea, the football we played was unbelievable,” says Sturridge. “I’m looking forward to the future with the club. I’m looking forward to achieving something because we will achieve something.

null,false,Woodentop_renegade,null,null,null,"I've got a pair of Gerbings T5s. I can't recommend them enough. If you run them off the bike battery it can be a bit of a pain to rig them up when you want to use them. I run the leads from the battery pig tail into my jacket, down the arms to each glove. There is an option to buy batteries for them which live in the back of the gloves in a pouch. If I remember rightly they're quite expensive and don't last very long. 

For me, gloves are better than grips. The reason I say that is because grips heat the palm of you hand. Your palm isn't exposed to the elements and wind chill, the backs of your hands and fingers are and that's exactly where the gloves give you heat, all down your thumb, backs of your hand and down your fingers, where they face the wind. 

These aren't under-gloves/glove liners. They have a built in element and are a motorcycle glove in their own right. I sometimes use them without hooking up any power to them so they're just a well insulated pair of gloves. 

In terms of build quality. I would say the gloves themselves are up there with some of the best manufacturers. Good quality materials, reasonably well insulated and all the workmanship I can see looks good too. They don't have the best insulation in their own right, but they're heated so they don't need to have the best insulation, the trade off is that they're a lot thinner than quite a few winter gloves which means that you've got better feel of the controls. The connector is pretty good. The only thing I have had any issue with is the lead which runs from the battery (where you plug the connector in) as I have had one corrode. I'm guessing electric + moisture has been a bad combo. So I only hook it up in the winter now and make sure it dries out properly and take it off when I'm not using it for long periods so there's no electricity from the battery going through it. The newer versions have replaced copper wire heating elements with some carbon fibre fancyness which apparently should never wear out and snap from repeated hand movements operating the controls. In any case if that ever happens you can send it back and get it replaced, life time guarantee. The packet they came in said they aren't waterproof and use waterproofing on them. I've never had a problem with them letting water in and I've never waterproofed them. 

The functionality is good too. You get a controller which allows you to select how much heat you want. flashing green is 25% of the overall output, steady green is 50%, steady yellow is 75% and steady red is 100%. I have never used above 75%. They do take a while to really get going and warm up. I've ridden from home to work, down a good lengh of motorway and A roads, through town, to work in -5c and then found my hands are too warm, which is a silly problem to have on a motorcycle. Like I say you can get the batteries but I think that's about another 80 quid and you get about 90 minutes or so on 75% I think.

BT Basic Broadband includes:

Broadband up to 16MB download speed
10 GB usage, typically this allows;
You to browse the internet for up to 30 hours a month
Stream up to 10 hours of video a month

Sure it's got a 10gb limit, so you won't be torrenting or watching Netflix thru it, but it'll mean many people who previously had to trudge to their local libraries etc to meet the loony targets of JSA, can now at least do it from home with less pressure.

So as England is the largest and most populous part of the UK, it's neither surprising nor artificial that modern 'Britishness' is more closely identified with the Anglo-Saxon tradition than with the practically-forgotten Celts. Beyond their borders, Celtic tribalism endured for centuries and has had a far stronger influence on Irish/Scottish/Welsh national identity. 

It's also worth bearing in mind that there was traditionally a huge divide between Highland Scots and Lowland Scots. Highlanders had a spoke Gaelic and thought of Scotland as a Celtic country, while Lowlanders spoke had much closer ethnic, linguistic and cultural ties with England than they did with the Highlanders.

Or you know, someone who's been in the game for as long as he has working under managers including Gerard Houlier, Rafa Benitez and Fabio Capello, knows a good manager when he sees one.

&gt; hes been managing since 2008 and hasn't won a trophy yet.

That really isn't a very good point considering he's only managed at Reading and Swansea, and his time with us has been 100% focused on the league. Edit: Forgot Watford.

&gt; When hes trying to blame the transfer committee it should be noted that the committee wanted Coutinho, the committee wanted Sturridge who Rodgers did not want to buy, Emre Can was a committee signing, Markovic was and Sterling was a Rafa buy. Rodgers has mostly been involved with the transfers of Allen, Borini, Lambert, Lallana and Lovren.

Out of the five players you mention, three of them will be at the club for a long time. Allen provides a good role in the squad, Lallana is amazing and Lovren will bounce back, we haven't seen him play with a defensive midfielder yet. If it makes Skrtel look decent then I'm sure Lovren can perform better, but to judge him after half a season is asinine. It's uncommon for more than 40% of signings to be a success, and with our approach of buying for potential there's no surprise we've had a fair amount of flops/disappointments.

&gt; 2/3 seasons being a disapointment isn't good enough and we could look to hire a better manager.

You have absolutely no patience, how can you be so quick to dismiss the best title run we've had in decades? The times we've struggled under Rodgers are times any manager in the world would have struggled. Specifically this season, losing Suarez and Sturridge being out for so long due to injury. Having to find a way to play with a striker that doesn't suit the other ten players (Balotelli/Lambert), until eventually giving up on that and radically experimenting with Sterling playing up front.

&gt; To be honest my biggest disillusionment of him was his management during the Champions League, I felt sick seeing how we performed.

After the transitional season, Brendan had almost built his squad, had the team playing quality football and gave us the best season we've had in decades, which you've already written off because it doesn't fit your agenda.

&gt; and this season has been miserable

After losing the best player in the league and having the second best scorer in the league injured for half the season while relying on an out-of-form Balotelli, a completely average Borini and a different type of striker in Lambert. The first half of the season was spent trying to find a way to play with Balo or Lambert up front until we finally found a solution with our current system. Sturridge is coming back now and next season we'll hopefully have a backup for him.

However, this view is no longer universally accepted. Archeologists say there is no archeological or placename evidence for a migration or invasion.[16] In his academic paper Were the Scots Irish?, archeologist Ewan Campbell suggests that in the ""maritime province"" of northern Ireland and western Scotland, ""sea communications dominated, and allowed a shared archaic language to be maintained, isolated from linguistic developments which were taking place [...] east of the Highland massif"".[16]
&gt; 
&gt; Scottish Gaelic developed as an independent language after the 12th century.

&gt; The traditional view was that Gaelic language was brought to Scotland, probably in the 4th century, by settlers from Ireland, who founded the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata on Scotland's west coast.[14][15] This is based mostly on medieval writings from the 9th and 10th centuries. However, **this view is no longer universally accepted. Archeologists say there is no archeological or placename evidence for a migration or invasion**.[16] In his academic paper Were the Scots Irish?, archeologist Ewan Campbell suggests that in the ""maritime province"" of northern Ireland and western Scotland, ""sea communications dominated, and allowed a shared archaic language to be maintained, isolated from linguistic developments which were taking place [...] east of the Highland massif"".[16]
&gt; 
&gt; Scottish Gaelic developed as an independent language after the 12th century. With the growth of Dál Riata and its use by the church, Scottish Gaelic became the language of most of Scotland, replacing Cumbric in the south and Pictish in the east.[17] [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic)",null,0,null,1422672838,null,0,false,0,co6f3hg,null,t3_2u6rfh,null,t1_co6f3hg,null,t1_co6dgcj,null,null,null,1424295222,null,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2,null

It seems to me that you have taken a very strong stand against the very small bit of anti-animal human behaviour which can be used to have a pop at Islam and managed to overlook the absolutely enormous swathe of animal cruelty done in the name of ensuring Brits can get access to cheap meat the rest of the time. Developing this argument, it seems a to me that you are much more interesting in scoring points against Islam than actually stopping cruelty to animals.

Lest their be any confusion, I am against animal cruelty in all forms. This includes the cruelty of halal slaughter, and the cruelty of western intensive farming methods. Becuase of this, I eat neither halal-slaughtered or intensively farmed meat (I actually eat no meat at all). If I had to pick though, I would pick a halal-slaughtered burger over a burger from a cow raised in intensive conditions but otherwise slaughtered 'humanely' any day (I'd add that western slaughter techniques are hardly humane either - in general, animals suffer substantial avoidable harm at the end of their lives whichever technique is used to deliver the killing blow)

If you were serious about ending cruelty to animals, you would firstly be a vegetarian or vegan, and secondly spend a lot more time attacking the culture which prizes the over-consumption of meat rather than the culture which calls for a different slaughter technique.

I don't think your argument that I am the cruel one holds water - you've clearly misinterpreted me (I might even suggest you did it on purpose) but I know what is the right and wrong of this situation, and the treatment of animals by mainstream intensive western farming is far and away the biggest wrong.

null,false,MarioMagnifico,null,null,null,"You have former players coming out and criticizing the manager all too often, even with someone who is widely acknowledged to be the one of the best man managers in Alex Ferguson. Rodgers is a good man manager for the players that he has in his plans, and there are accounts of this. Sure, he spins his own agenda at times with certain unfavored players but, at the end of the day, this doesn't affect much from a *Liverpool* perspective beyond intangible transfer fee reductions. 

People use his man management as a stick to beat Rodgers with, but if you look at the players that have thrived under his leadership like Sterling, Henderson, Suarez, Flanno, Sturridge and others, there is substanial evidence that Rodgers does know he can get the most of players *that he sees a high standard of value*. Cite natural player progression all you want but, when there are that many instances of genuine improvement in players' performance and the team morale is as high as it clearly is (when not dictated by poor results and media influenced despair), there is clearly a positive trend. Another important thing to note is that we have *very* imperfect information to judge a practice that is mainly performed in closed doors since our only information on the matter is often influenced by bias (in the case of former players, for instance) or, similarly, agenda-driven. Even my own argument is weakened because of imperfect information, and I can acknowledge this, since there are many variables at play and ultimately we can only speculate on how big an impact Rodgers has had on the development of certain players. 

People try to deal in absolutes in a subject that nobody, however informed, can possibly speak with as much certainty. I, on the other hand, can acknowledge that I may be wrong, and the strongest conclusion I would try to draw is that given the positive trends in player performance, team morale (quantifiable without really being technically quantifiable), and the unreliability of the information fuelling the opposing argument, the evidence suggests that Rodgers is not a ""bad"" man manager.",null,0,null,1422676000,null,0,false,0,co6gjp8,null,t3_2u8z6q,null,t1_co6gjp8,null,t1_co6ai92,null,null,null,1424294545,null,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8,null

I agree much is supposition and inference and to an extent you have to be a little wary of what ex-players say, but the stories are remarkably consistent across many in terms of how they felt he was not being upfront with them that I find it difficult to not believe there is an element of truth in it and, for me, this is poor management and it almost inevitably will have negative repercussions.  Say we wanted Enner Valencia, as an example.  Do you think if he asked Downing or Carroll they'd give him a positive feeling for the club?  To some extent it's irrelevant what ex-players think but that doesn't mean their influence can't be felt in the future.  If they are being this vocal to the press about it, what do you think they are saying to their teammates?

Another element which is easily provable is Rodgers talking badly about his players to the press.  Downing being lazy, Mario doesn't know how to mark at corners, etc.  These are, in my opinion, also signs of poor management and they pretty undeniably have happened.  His rationale for doing it may be one of hoping for a positive outcome from it, but in my opinion a manager should never say anything bad about their players publicly (unless it's something like 'Suarez shouldn't bite' or something inherently obvious).",null,0,null,1422678517,null,0,false,0,co6hnx5,null,t3_2u8z6q,null,t1_co6hnx5,null,t1_co6gjp8,null,null,null,1424293964,null,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0,null

null,false,giltirn,null,null,null,"I have never been a church-goer, so I may be completely wrong, but in anecdotal experience I have come across two types of Christian:

-Those who were brought up with Christianity and accept it as fact simply because they were told it at a very young age and have not really thought about the implications. These people, in my experience, are usually either not particularly religious or are fervently (and slightly scarily) religious; the latter tend to be people who have adopted an aggressively defensive position after having their beliefs questioned to a level sufficient to make them doubt. The former are either those who have never really been challenged or those who are fighting an internal war between their intellect and their upbringing. 

-Those who adopted Christianity by choice, typically because of some difficult period in their life (often the death of a loved one). They tend to be quite Zen about the whole thing and surprisingly open to debate; they are comfortable with their choice and have overcome most intellectual objections.

Nevertheless, in both cases the key aspect of the religion is the eternal life part; the reward for all the suffering. Some don't really think about it, having been told from an early age that if they confess A times a month and perform B rites then their place in Heaven is assured. Given that these things are part of their daily ritual anyway, it is hardly worth dwelling on the fact. For others, (I'm thinking of Type II in my anecdotal grouping here) the eternal life thing is absolutely essential to their belief and indeed the reason they were drawn to it in the first place.

Ruining a cultural icon?

Each actor brought his own personality and quirks to the role, and as such, each Doctor is wildly different from the last.

I just genuinely don't see what sets him and Salah apart, or what makes people think he is worth keeping. He's clearly nowhere near as good as Willian is. Schurrle wasn't ""good"" last season, he was woefully inconsistent, as he has been this season. My point about him and Salah is that neither have really had enough time on the pitch to prove themselves.

I couldn't give a fuck if a player comes across as likeable or not, I only care about how they play for my club. 

I can guarantee you that not one person in Stamford Bridge today will really care that much that either Scurrle or Salah are going - neither are really popular with the local fans as neither have performed.

The Holiday Working visa is a pretty good scheme but, unfortunately, after age 30 there are no other benefits. 

I've met so many Brits who have family ties to Australia. It's a shame there isn't a stronger bilateral agreement for travel and work between the two countries.

People who are ""benefit scroungers"" don't tend to spend £1500 on an international flight. I'm pretty sure it's a safe bet that any travel between the two countries is going to be beneficial for the destination country.

Each country has a lot to offer, so I don't think there would be a rush of people to either side.

EDIT: If you're smart, you can use the Holiday Working visa as a means to settle in the UK. You've got two years to find a job and work with a company. If they really like you, they'll sponsor you for a Tier 2 Working visa. After 5 years, you can apply for a settlement visa.

Ok so this is the bit that is on topic.  You are suggesting that it isn't a problem to encourage and support people to not work.  I disagree with that.  I also find it perplexing that you say non-existent jobs.  If you are in an environment that has nothing for you, it is up to you to adapt to the environment.  In this context we've got someone who dreams of being an actor, in a manner not too dissimilar to Tobias in Arrested Development, the problem isn't that there is a lack of work, it's that no one wants such a useless person to work for them.

It's very worrying I think, the changes we've had in the last few decades are definitely creating a divide between people whose labour is replicated or multiplied by some system, think designers, programmers, investment banking traders etc.  On the other side you have those who benefit little from the mechanisation, for instance coffee baristas, the machine takes much of the effort out of the job, but it's still required that they are there at 8am, and are physically limited by how many customers they can serve.   They will not have an 'app go viral' or similar multiplier effect.

We obviously need a fair system that handles the fact some peoples actions have a much more intrinsic economic value, than others.

To me, basic income isn't that, this is because of the underlying principle that you are removing economic activity, the only way to improve the quality of life is to increase efficiency.

GPs are allocated in accordance to the post code where you live.  Go to [this](http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/GP/LocationSearch/4) website and see where the nearest GP practices are to you.  You can look on their website and see which is the best fit (eg: open hours, a GP that specialises in nephrology, etc).  Give them a ring and see if they are accepting new patients.  If they are you need to pop in at some point and fill out some paperwork and provide them with proof of address and ID.  Then you'll need an appointment to register with them.  This appt will usually be with a health care assistant or nurse who will just verbally confirm your previous medical history and do basic obs- like blood pressure, urine sample, height/weight.  You could try to arrange an appt with a docter at the same time to get started, but some places may not want to do that until you are properly registered.  At this appt it's helpful to bring any medical info you have from your past.  If you've been at another GP in the UK it will automatically be transferred via your NHS number.  Otherwise, it's best if you bring in your copies so they have something to get started on.

Any A&amp;E or specialist will always refer back to your GP for general maintainance of your condition.  A&amp;E is there for emergency issues that may arise, but cannot deal with a long term condition- they will always refer on.  A specialist will give advice on procedures, medication, treatments and may be able to arrange some of it, but the GP is overall responsible for ensuring that there is continuity in your care.  The GP will also prescribe any longterm meds.

Congratulations, that's Switzerland. They are about to have a referendum on a €30,000 household basic income for everyone. Their army is entirely made from current conscripts in training with a very small reserve, so at some stage everyone able to has had military training.

The reason why I say they don't cut its as I cannot see that many job posting for jobs which require a degree in the arts or even things like business studies. It mostly seems to be subjects like engineering, computer science economics. Or vocational ones like social work or professions allied to medicine. If there are then I doubt they are posted on the likes of Monster, jobsite and reed for example. Would be interesting to know where I could see them though. 

Why would the not be designed for mature graduates as well? Genuine question. I wouldn't mind your own personal feedback on that. It seems really pointless doing a degree then in my opinion if the job isn't even available to you if you are deemed too old.

You are right in saying that I should use my previous work experiences. However mine don't translate well to professional jobs. A selection of my previous experiences are: Sprinkling cheese toppings onto pizzas, making car seats, production line work making paper plates, selling PPI, bar work and sorting/cleaning out nuts and bots for the engineers to use.

Costa probably should have been sent off once earlier in the season. He definitely shouldn't have had a 3 game ban for something you can't even attempt to prove.

The media outcry against other teams is tiny. And as usual if you're winning you're persecuted more. That's not really a complex. That actually does happen.

Either way, if anything seemed to happen proportionally to other teams it would seem fair. As it is it seems more like Chelsea get persecuted for being successful. Also quite possibly because their fan base is pretty small in reality. Whereas in other countries there is practically a cult of club. You can't really rip those clubs apart in a media frenzy. It simply doesn't happen, Real Madrid fans are simply never going to be called the shittest fans in the league despite whatever, largely because, they number the most. Therefore most of the audience papers sell things to are Madridstas. On the other hand, in England that reallly isn't the case for many teams other than Liverpool and Manchester United. Most people support their local-ish team. Therefore everybody will read something unified against a common enemy.

The victim complex isn't surprising.
Perhaps this maybe summarises my view point:

&gt;Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you 
― Joseph Heller, Catch-22

I take that to mean that maybe Costa's ban had nothing to do with massive media outpouring. But it doesn't mean that people didn't try and influence the ban. And if anything, that's more of the problem.

An example I'd take from areas outside of football is the sacking of Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross. It's worth noting in those instances before the media picked it up, the complaints were tiny. So that's the complaints from people who actually listened to the broadcasts. Then there was the media campaign to get the sacked by several poorly informed journalists, aiming to drive up a storm because everyone knows who these people are, therefore the story appeals to them.
There were literally more complaints because of the media uproar afterwards than people who actually listened to the broadcast. The people who actually seek out that entertainment were considerably less likely to be offended etc.

Essentially what I'm saying here is it's the nature of the beast. It gives these people their livelihoods and it also takes it away to an extent. What I've not really understood, is in cases like Costa being labelled as a criminal, surely he's well entitled to sue for libel? I would imagine such cases would rather force the media to portray cases with a more even hand.

But I get what you're saying because Cahill should have had a 3 match ban for the kick on Kane. No doubt about that.

Suarez was slightly different, because pretty much all of that you could prove he did something unnatural. Except then after that he wasn't getting any of the penalty shouts he deserved or any of the other fouls. Which was ridiculous.

But Aguero has repeatedly done some pretty violent things. Similarly Zabaleta has done too. It's not like Costa was even close to the two footed studded launch Aguero did to Luiz's backside.

Suarez did receive a worse punishment for a worse, proven offence, and a repeated offence. He was treated somewhat unfairly though. I do think it's quite hard to argue that Costa isn't being made more of a villain than he actually is. (edit: apologies for poor syntax there)

It's clear that this media influence does exist, Suarez was treated pretty poorly. But then wtf was that bite. With Costa he's almost a victim of a false reputation. Aguero doesn't have that reputation. He's a pretty boy Argentine, Costa is the ugly brute that the media would love to make a comic book villain.

As for Eduardo, most people didn't seem to think he deserved a ban ([Guardian Poll)](http://www.theguardian.com/football/poll/2009/aug/28/eduardo-champions-league-ban). Which was strange but as you've said, he was touched a bit. Which makes the debate between simulation or exaggeration. And it didn't result in a ban did it? So in other words, this is somewhat similar to the argument we're having here except the player didn't even get the bloody ban. Which is the premise of the unfair arguments.

I mean law in general requires premises etc when cases are being argued. I remember going through solicitor bases finding such cases. I somehow doubt that the FA has anything close to that.

Sometimes it's not about what degree you do, it's about having the right attitude and commitment. You're doing maths, this will be related to programming in some way. As an example, Developers are problem solvers, I'm sure there's plenty of problem solving in your degree.

Many of the clients I recruit for look past experience and want to know what an individual is interested in. I know I'm using programming a lot as an example but if someone applies for a developer role and doesn't have any actual experience, hiring managers will look through the CV for any hints about if that person is actually interested in development.

If I were you, I wouldn't buy too much at first and wait till you just pick up knowledge and experience as you go along. I bought too much pricey stuff at first! My understanding is that vitamins are antioxidants, as are a lot of plant extracts, eg green tea. This serum is rated Best on Beautypedia: http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/olay/regenerist/_/Regenerist-Regenerating-Serum-Fragrance-Free. They are reviewing the US formulation, but as far as antioxidants etc go, the review would be the same I think. I actually bought the US formula of this serum from amazon.com because I was concerned about the combination of a preservative called DMDM Hydantoin and an 'amine' ingredient in the UK version of the serum. [EDIT On the Olay page you link to, they list an older UK formulation that doesn't containg DMDM Hydantoin and Triethanolamine, but my impression is that the one now available is this one: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Olay-Regenerist-Moisturiser-Regenerating-Fragrance/dp/product-description/B000T9AS5E/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=117332031&amp;s=beauty. I may well be misunderstanding the science here: I don't know what an 'amine' is, I just saw it in the ingredients and guessed].
This is probably me being stupidly paranoid: obviously loads of people in the UK are buying it and it must have been through testing, but in the ingredient dictionary on Beautypedia it raised a theoretical concern about when these two ingredients were combined. You can check it out yourself and see what you think.

HOWEVER, I've been thinking about this and I've started to feel really guilty for recommending anyone anything skin care related on here! I personally have never read any research on antioxidants, SPF or whatever. So, I don't really want to encourage you to spend your money on a serum that might just be snake oil for all I know! I haven't used the serum yet, but I'm not sure that I personally will bother with a serum or with products that don't give me results that I can see with my own eyes once I've used them up. The main positive thing I've seen with my own eyes from skincare products is simply less dry skin after moving to a heavier moisturiser that cost about £1.50 from Boots. I'll probably keep using SPF as my impression is the evidence for aging being linked to sun damage is compelling, but I personally have never read a single paper on it.
NB I haven't tried exfoliation yet: who knows, I might fall in love with it!

I cant attend any extra classes due to time restrictions and my head will probably explode if I have to even more work. So going to programming meet ups or having extra curricular activities on the side is a no go for me at present.

You say you recruit for clients? How many of these candidates for the IT roles are over the age of 40 and just trying to break in to the industry with no commercial experience? As programming say is not part of my degree curriculum I would have to do this after.This being realistic would take me 18 months to 2 years to acquire the necessary  certs and a portfolio of work I had done in my spare time to show to potential employers.

I'm not being negative, just realistic for what would be available to me. Ageism, sexism and racism exists and is a barrier in all facets in life.

Why is the issue of cost dealt with in such a silly way? He claims it costs nothing onthe NHS in one sentence and then completely refutes this in the next by talking about per capita cost. No-where is the claim of zero cost care on the NHS qualified as 'at the point of delivery'.

The article makes no comparison about the aspects of healthcare in which the NHS falls down terribly, management. Sure there's little paperwork for the patient but this is more than compensated for by the insanely high level of paperwork required of doctors, nurses, and managers.
