&gt; It is clear that making a photograph, film, visual image of the building or work of art or a graphic work representing it is not an infringement of the copyright in that work itself (although it may be an infringement of the something else, for example the architect’s drawings). Nor is it an infringement to issue copies of the new work or to communicate them to the public. However, **the making (issuing copies of, communicating to the public etc.) of a derivative work from that new work is not so obviously covered.**

The first part seems reasonable, but that last part is a bit of a stretch. The only way that seems to work is if the derivative work isn't a graphic image, photograph, film or broadcast image of it. But it's quite hard to see how you could infringe the copyright in a building without one of those.

But then I guess they're the fancy IP lawyer (whose firm wouldn't hire) me; although that doesn't mean they're an expert in copyright.

We attacked and attacked and yet we could not score.

This here was how Rodgers failed.

Okay so blaming him against Chelsea is harsh you might say.
What about Basel?

The fuck happened there?

Rodgers doesn't change his tactics when needed. 
Rodgers also is not able to motivate players when needed.

Losing in the last home match last season was was a clear indication that he is not the man.
Now people will say that the blame lies on the owners, and those people are just looking for excuses.

If your role is to manage players and the club then that is what you are to do.
Nearly all the managers have a difficult board and owners to deal with but those who don't let those issues impact performances succeed, while others fail miserably.

If you take a casual picture of the building, or a photo that it happens to be in (eg landscape, skyline, arguably a selfie, etc) then you're probably fine and not breaching copyright laws. Loss of the FoP means the owner of those design copyrights could come after you for those works.

The people in a public place one is different, although those individuals do still have rights ('identity rights' IIRC) if you use those pictures in such a way it has a negative impact on them, but not just for a picture that contains you - in most public spaces there's no reasonable expectation of privacy.",null,0,null,1435885671,null,0,false,0,csqiqh8,null,t3_3bvyjv,null,t1_csqiqh8,null,t1_csq2mes,null,null,null,1437539529,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

People have worked hard for these GCSEs. I've been working since January every night to ensure I get decent grades, and you come along and cheat on your exam and get a good mark. I wouldn't hesitate to report you.

The point of exams is to test people's abilities. Cheating does not test your ability, and it makes others less likely to achieve higher grades, as the grade boundaries are set according to the results of everyone on that series. Higher results via cheating = higher grade boundaries for students who actually worked. So no, screw you, I hope this comes back to bite you in the arse when you get onto A-Levels or whatever you're doing next in life.

&gt; Factually the position is now clearer. The reason that the Crawfords owed more at the end of the mortgage than they did at the beginning is that there is no longer an endowment policy which was supposed to repay the capital borrowed. However that came about, the Crawfords have known since at least 1999 that there was no means in place of repaying the original capital. Mr Crawford was offered the means to repay capital by way of a repayment mortgage but refused. That explains how we have ended up at the end of the mortgage term without repayment of capital.

He had been advised to pay it off or to try and come to some sort of agreement with the bank and he refused, i have also read somewhere that his daughter said they could pay it off but they don't want to. 

The best thing he could have done was to come to some arrangement with the bank then take them to court with regards to the missing endowment policy.

What happened is that an interest only mortgage was set up and the customer decided that they would make more money by not paying their mortgage and investing the money instead. At a certain point low cost endowment policies were all the rage and the impression was that the investment would pay more than the mortgage cost. Everybody involved, including regulators, believed that to be the case.

The misselling came in because people were not made properly aware that there was a risk. Low cost endowments became so *de rigueur* that people took them without understanding them. Later when the scandal broke it was decided that the banks should have taken more care to properly explain them, so a window was opened up for people to claim against banks for misselling.

That is **NOT** what has happened here.

What has happened here - and there is a lot of it around - is that people tell themselves ""Oh we'll just stop for now until things get better. Young kids, childcare etc."" they do not put a plan in place. Or they know their plan is going to be short. Not everybody with an interest only mortgage has or had an endowment. Many have cashed the endowment in to consolidate debt, or spunk the money unwisely or just stop the expense. Some had savings/investments to use which they've stopped paying into, or spent. 

We send them letters, phone them, invite them in to branch, suggest alternative routes for them to get advice - CABs etc. They ignore it all. They steadfastly refuse to do anything to sort things out. 

Then they get to retirement and their mortgage goes into default. Then they blame the bad banks - and people have a lot of sympathy for them because they can tell their side of the story and the DPA prevents the bank responding.

tl;dr 

Some people were missold. Other people were willfully reckless and ignored dozens of warnings then blamed the banks. It seems Mr Crawford is  one of those people.

Neither of them are suited to the DM spot. Emre is defensively and physically the best DM of the 3 and if Lucas gets injured/suspended then why would he not replace him? 

In this modern age players play in new positions all the time. Ibe is not a wingback but he did a pretty good job as one. Milner is by no means a striker but he did a pretty good job as one for City.

I see this part of my post has upset you. You're right that the proper term is not bedroom tax. It is called ""abolition of the spare room subsidy"". I refer to it as the ""bedroom tax"" because that is the name that the media and general public decided to give it. The advisers who work for the housing association that I am with also call it that.

null,false,sacredstones,null,null,null,"actually i think that calls even more for some caution from our CB's. it should be the DM's job to cover for the fullbacks. the only time the CB should come out is if the counter comes from the wing (like you mentioned) and the winger is isolated and the CB has the chance to clear. Skrtel does this. otherwise our DM should also do this. If the CB goes out to meet the wing-counter and there is an opposing midfielder nearby, then we risk an easy 2 on 1 with a hold for the midfielder to run into. The thing that pisses me off the most is that people act like Skrtel doesn't do this. he does do this. I can recall at least 5 times last season where skrtel met the winger and slide-tackled the ball out of play. i remember distinctly because every time it happened I would breathe a sigh of relief and say ""i fucking love you skrtel"". Lovren did this as well, but many times he was late to read the tackle and thus missed the tackle. he also would do this regardless of where our team was and if there was any opposing players near the counter attack. experience beats all at CB, and so for this reason I would feel safest with Skrtel and Sahko next season. As i said in another comment, Lovren, Ilori and Gomez deserve chances, i just don't see any of them being as consistent as Skrtel. 

Of course another way to fix this would be to play a designated DM. ",null,0,null,1435893454,null,0,false,0,csqmnug,null,t3_3bvwum,null,t1_csqmnug,null,t1_csqjw2y,null,null,null,1437542762,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

No it is not. You're making assumptions on a subject that you seem rather ignorant about. A doctor does not diagnose you with PTSD. You have to go to a clinic and have an assessment with either a psychologist or a psychiatric. 

I suffer from acute PTSD. Unless you suffer from a mental health disorder yourself, do you really think it's fair for you to make those judgements?

He has the work horse mentality, and unlike Cuadrado, this dude is a tank, he's got the biggest calves I've ever seen for a player his size, he's a brute, and he has an eye for goal and is a decent finisher. If Jose can help him with his decision making and playing smarter on the pitch, he could turn out to be a steal. If not, big deal, we'd probably sell him to Wolfsburg for like 20 million.

This is what complex PTSD is:

Complex PTSD (sometimes called “Disorder of Extreme Stress”) is found among individuals who have been exposed to prolonged traumatic circumstances, especially during childhood, such as childhood sexual abuse. These individuals often are diagnosed with borderline or antisocial personality disorder or dissociative disorders. They exhibit behavioral difficulties (such as impulsivity, aggression, sexual acting out, eating disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, and self-destructive actions), extreme emotional difficulties (such as intense rage, depression, or panic) and mental difficulties (such as fragmented thoughts, dissociation, and amnesia). The treatment of such patients often takes much longer, may progress at a much slower rate, and requires a sensitive and highly structured treatment program delivered by a team of trauma specialists.

null,false,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"You should actually look at that report, the bottom 10% only pays 4.6% of their income in income tax. The tax free allowance is mostly to benefit the middle classes (and is costing us a lot too). This is compared with 11.6% of their income which goes on VAT (a regressive tax), something the Tories raised at the same time they cut the top rate of income tax (the only real progressive tax we have). Look at page 16 in the report, you'll see any income tax changes will have almost no effect on the poorest in our country as they basically pay no income tax anyway. If he truly wanted to solve the problem as you suggest he wouldn't go about it by increasing the tax threshold. This is just manipulation pure &amp; simple, as is the case with most Tory policies when you look closer into it. That's because they have different objectives, which is fine, but people shouldn't try to put them out as being something they're not. 

Look at the suggestions in that report, no where does it state income tax should be changed: 

- Council tax should be transformed into a progressive property tax
- Government should aim to reduce VAT when it has a budget surplus
- The upper limit of National Insurance Contributions should be raised

Do you see the Tories doing any of those things? Before you tell me Labour won't either, I don't disagree, they're all pretty much as bad as each other. AFAIK the Lib Dems did suggest changing council tax into a progressive system though &amp; the Greens have obviously suggested all of the above (VAT phase out / progressive land tax / wealth tax etc) but neither of those two parties have any power.

People shy away from it and think it's a lot of money for one day (I'd guess ~£100), but it's cheaper and easier than constantly re-sitting tests because you don't understand why you're failing; they'll be able to tell in ten minutes whether you'd pass a Mod 2 or not.

Here's the advice I got from my instructor: your minors (you're allowed 15) are there to be used - don't be afraid to use them. If you get neutral by mistake, don't worry about it. Don't let silly little things make you nervous and annoyed at yourself, because they probably won't make you fail but if they put you into the ""oh what's the point, I've clearly failed"" mindset then you will. 

A major is anything ""serious"" or ""dangerous"". If you make anyone brake, swerve or stop - that's a major and you've failed. The problem you'll probably have as you've done plenty of miles is knowing you can make a gap which, in the real world, all of us would go for. However, this is a test and if the examiner decides it's too close then you'll fail. 

Ride on the side of caution. Going too slow or not pulling out quickly enough will earn you a minor. Pushing your luck will fail you. Also, getting lost on the free ride is a minor, not a major. Don't worry about it. 

But mainly, just ride. After five minutes, you'll probably forget he's there. Enjoy a nice 45-minute ride about the place, stay vigilant, do constant shoulder and mirror checks (and make sure you move your head to check your mirrors so he can see you doing it), and you should be okay.

It's a grand statement but in real terms it means nothing. It should be noted that one of the main reasons the Horsdean traveller site has been such a disaster is the fact that it was built with a terrible infrastructure. The whole site was built with enough washing and toilet facilities for two families, not the original 20 plus families it was agreed for. Clearly this was a massive fubar. Whilst I would like to say this was down to the contractor, I would wager that actually it was an oversight or a money saving exercise by the Council that backfired. 

With all the good will in the world, travellers go where they want. BHCC have an extreme lax attitude towards removing them from sites and cannot insist this site is used. Couple that with the hundreds of families that hit Brighton each year, a site with a handful of pitches does not assist the problem. My experience as an ex council worker was to avoid travellers due to threats of violence to us. Traveller sites become no go areas that even the police avoid unless necessary. Families hit Brighton for a two month summer holiday and then reduce the city's green spaces to shit. As this is the case why would a family use a site and pay taxes when they can go where the fuck they like with impunity?

The Council and the police's failure to deal with and support its staff is one of the reasons I left. I got tired of being blamed for such inefficiency and spent much of my time explaining that my hands were tied. 

I would like to say that travellers are lovely people but over the years I have gone from accepting to mildly hostile as IMHO they are filthy, aggressive parasites that collectively cost the council several million pounds a year to manage.

The mostly stop-start nature of London riding means you'll rarely attain speeds that overtake what the bike can achieve. That said, you are likely to be passed often by people on fast hybrids and road bikes, who can use their gears to accelerate faster and maintain a higher speed at a lower cadence, but over a 4-6 mile ride I seriously doubt you'll be more than a minute or two slower than them. I can't speak for longer commutes than that - it may be the same situation, it may not.

I don't own one, but considering the majority of maintenance I do on my bike is looking after the drivetrain, you'll find it easy to keep. 

If you choose fixed rather than just single speed, be sure to get something with at least a front brake - the law requires braking mechanisms for both wheels, and a fixed rear wheel with a front brake lever satisfy this.

That's not Toryism, it's just not living in the 1970s. 


Blair achieved an incredible amount. He brought the NHS back up off its knees, completely turned around education, introduced minimum wage and saw through the NI peace process (among many other things).

Did you try Googling ""munitions law key lengths""? That will provide all the detail you need. Understanding why key lengths are important to encryption is important in this debate. That's how the US handled it and it's likely the UK would attempt a similar approach.

&gt; So how does a special build of Chrome help with that?

Chrome UK would be configured to work with shorter encryption keys than the standard version of Chrome, thus allowing the UK government (and many others) to decrypt web traffic.

Many of those ""independent"" news sources are anything but. But also, as flawed as the BBC is, unlike the BBC there is no attempt at governance with any of them. So they can say whatever they like with no come back at all, which is fine for the anti vaxxers, homeopaths and tin hat brigade but not so great for the rest of us. Believe it or not, the BBC has pretty strict editorial standards and their staff tend to adhere to them. 

Your comments about you not having kids implied that you thought people without kids shouldn't be spending money on them. Otherwise they weren't that relevant. 

I'm sure those subscription services are great, but to get as much content as you get on the BBC for your child you are either going to have to have a commercial influence or pay them more money than we pay for the Beeb. For the remaining free ones, are they really offering award winning content and who decided what they show? 

Are parents going to want to sift through hundreds of hours of dross on YouTube with Lord knows what in the comments, selecting content that educated and informs their kids? While YouTube plays adverts to them every so often? Or are they going to want to put them I front of pre selected programming with no advertising that they can trust? 

4% of the population (slightly less actually) sought their content solely elsewhere. I believe that people should need to put their license number into iplayer to view, but accept I am probably in a minority on that. I definitely think that foreigners should be able to buy a license and do that though.

Indeed, the current trust is not great, but a) they are bound by a charter, which limits how blatant they can be and b) the staff of the BBC largely stick to the terms of that charter. People can be replaced but the BBC is irreplaceable.

I think that the TV license is a national service and am proud to pay it. We have already established that most people do not consume media like you and can infer that they like the BBC. So just like schools, you are funding something that doesn't affect you, for the greater good.

For greater impartiality, funding out of general taxation is a terrible idea. 

Sadly though, the right wing media agree with you, as do the party in charge, so we won't be seeing any improvement in the Beeb for a while. More like the NHS we will see a gradual deliberate degradation, whilst Murdoch and the rest of the vultures hover.

I believe that is what they are aiming for. One could argue that sending/receiving arbitrary random data could already be a crime. 

Let's say you and I begin streaming random data to each other - completely innocent and random data, taken straight from /dev/random. The police believe we are actually sending encrypted data in order to plot a terror attack. Under RIPA 2000, refusal to disclose the encryption keys is a crime in and of itself. So we could be charged with refusing to hand over the keys to our ""encrypted"" data.

The monitoring side of things is simple: watch for encrypted traffic flowing through the network. Check to see if this traffic is on the ""allowed to use encryption"" whitelist.

&gt; “With a Benteke type, you have someone who will stay up there and stretch defenders. If you have someone who stretches the defence and makes the pitch bigger there’s a lot more space for the likes of Firmino, Coutinho and Henderson to run into.

&gt; “When you’ve got players who want to drop deep all the time, you’re easier to mark as a team. When forwards drop into Coutinho’s position, it makes it harder for him to get on the ball.

&gt; “Liverpool’s game isn’t all about getting down the line and whipping crosses in, it’s about movement but I think Benteke has got that.

&gt; “I can’t stress enough how important it is that we get a forward like that - someone to make the pitch big. It’s vital for us because it brings others into the game.”

Of course Fowler gets it perfectly! The problem with Balotelli was never about him being a ""big targetman"" or whatever, it was about not offering movement and not making runs in behind. 

He's also right about the two-fold effect it has on our midfielders - one, it doesn't give them anyone to aim at with their through balls. Two, it gives them less space to operate in because the opposition can push their defensive line up, safe in the knowledge Balotelli won't run in behind.

I'm not convinced Benteke's the best option out there at the price it's going to take, but I don't think he'll be ""another Balotelli"".

I would be upset by anti-gay cartoons also, but I definitely would not try and ban them - rather see it countered with expression and protest. As an aside, if there were anti-gay cartoons and there was a propensity for gay rights protesters to go and murder people over such cartoons, I would actually say that there was a serious ideological issue within the gay community. I would hold the gay community up to serious scrutiny and not pretend they had any sort of justification to even have a ""tiny minority"" perform such acts. Thankfully, as they don't have any sort of backward ideology underscoring their differences they don't tend to do that but I think you can understand my point.

Some of these artists may indeed be arses but some are simply pushing the envelope and making sure our society does not degrade into tyrannical shit we see in unenlightened countries. I do not support their message, but I support the fact the underlying human rights and freedoms that allow them to do it. I wouldn't blink an eyelid over a picture of Jesus with a dildo, why should somebody get murdered simply over a smiling picture of an Islamic character? Not to mention that depicting Islamic characters is banned *for Muslims* to avoid them suddenly becoming idolators. Which is ironic because the way they behave over their beloved prophet is zealously idolatrous. This precedent should not apply to the rest of us, and I honestly believe the reason it is applied to us is because a superiority complex toward dirty non-believers and an assertion of their beliefs over the rest of us.

If they don't like it, don't go look at it. Just like the rest of us when faced with something we don't agree with.

1. Please do something about the site design. There's a reason very few sites featuring written pieces display them with grey text on dark blackgrounds. Go white text, or a different scheme altogether with a light background.

2. If you're starting a sentence with ""I am not saying anything new"" halfway through a paragraph, that's a big sign that the paragraph it's a part of is fluff and can be shortened. Both this piece and your last piece had long and unnecessary buildup paragraphs.

3. Similarly, if you're starting a paragraph with ""To this point, I may have said a few things you didn’t know, but I haven’t really made any groundbreaking revelations."" halfway through the article, it's a big sign you've been writing a lot of empty stuff. Get to the point quicker, otherwise people will stop reading.

4. The second half of your article is baffling - Daniel Sturridge doesn't get mentioned at all, but Sterling is central to your ideas when it's unlikely he'll still be here.

5. You say a few big things without explaining ""why"" - why would you be excited if we got Rondon? Why does Ings give us something different from last season, when there's an argument to be made that he's a better version of Borini? Why is Lallana's role this season more important than last season? 

6. Have a think about better ways to express statistics than just a long chunk of text. A table with columns for 13/14 and 14/15 would've been great. That part of your article has some of the stuff that's most noteworthy - I didn't know our goal contribution from midfield was the same across both seasons, nor did I know we got more key passes from midfield last season.

For a long time, a lot of subreddit moderators have felt that the admins have been more-or-less ignoring the community, especially regarding suggestions about how Reddit could be modified to make moderation easier. There is a feeling that the community has been fixing issues, free of charge, that the company should have been fixing for themselves.

The reason this has happened *now* is that Reddit fired Victoria Taylor (/u/chooter) yesterday. Victoria used to help with AMAs, often as the only point of contact between IamA mods and celebrities (many of whom have been not entirely computer-literate, and couldn't really do an AMA without her help).

Now, for all we know, Reddit had some perfectly good reason to fire her with no warning, but the problem is that they didn't communicate effectively, or indeed at all, with the mods of subreddits that effectively depended on her.


The IamA mods were completely blindsided, and [had to hear about it from somebody who was trying to do an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq405c).

Saints barely gave him a chance, though, and when they did, apart from a couple of nice flicks, an exciting dribble here and there, there wasn't much else to write home about. He wasn't poor or hopelessly out of his depth. He just didn't make much of an impression on the matches. In his defence, Saints' form faltered pretty badly in the second half of the season, particularly their attacking play, and it must be difficult for a young guy to move to a new country, a new league, halfway through the season and try and make a big difference as a bit part player in a team struggling for form.  

But he's only 23. Too early to write off. Physically, he looked like he could cope with the Premier League. He moves well. He's not lazy and perennially unfit, like Gaston Ramirez. He's a talented player who seems to have just lost his way. If Saints could persuade Benfica to knock the price down to, say, around what they paid for him (£5.5m), or less, I think that he'd be a reasonable punt. 

He could turn out to be an absolute bargain if the club can get him back on track.

Putting hedgehogs in the guttering tomorrow morning, so I get to play with the long ladders again. I'll kill my hernia for a couple of days but it's better than having water piss down my neck as I open the front door. Assuming it ever rains again, of course.

A selection of Belgian ales. Lots of flavour &amp; a good dollop of alcohol.

You have to use your eyes a bit more, some fruit and veg might be a bit gnarlier round the edges rather than the perfect wrapped-up specimens you get in a supermarket, but it is often a *lot* cheaper.

The difference I suppose is supermarkets have to be spot-on each time, all year round. So they will have strawberries from all over the world, then in summer when there is a glut they can say they are ""on offer"" and pile them higher.Looks aren't everything though, they might have ""perfect"" berries, but they will be the larger, bouncier ones rather than soft and unctious. I have had avocados, mangoes, melons, pears and peaches from supermarkets that look lovely but simply never ripen. 

Also, as a lot of it is more seasonal, you may not have everything you want 100% of the time.

It's really complicated... Multiple reasons, I think. For one, the system here, the teaching and learning style was completely different from what I was used to at school back home. Like I said, I had very good results at school, I was the top of my class, but I was one of these people who would slack off for most of the year, not do homework, skip a lot of classes but prepare hard for the important things like tests, essays and exams. Also, the teachers were always very clear about therequirements and instructions. I just wasn't used to disciplining myself and working hard all the time, not only in occasional bursts when I absolutely had to. So at the beginning of the first semester I was overwhelmed and at first I tried to keep up, and later it got easier but then... I don't even know what happened, it was probably that nobody was holding my hand like at school and I thought I could get away with skipping more lectures and tutorials, not submitting assignments if I realized they were too difficult and I wouldn't be able to get a good grade anyway, procrastinated a lot, etc.

The funny thing is that I absolutely fell in love with my course. It's social anthropology. I still did most of the readings and loved most of the lectures and actively participated in tutorials, I've read a lot of articles and books on anthropology in my free time. I guess in the end it was just my lack of discipline and unwillingness to put more work than I was used to. I'm in absolute despair now and I haven't even told my parents yet.

Know the feeling! Too warm and too much work. Covering three folks roles including my own this week and next. FUN.

It's never going to rain again. It feels that way anyway.

&gt; Rum (mojitos or dacquiris). Whisky (manhattans, on the rocks or just neat, from the bottle as nature intended). Maybe a brandy after Sunday lunch. You?

Rum. I have some nice bottles of Havana Club and Diplomatico at home waiting with my name on it. Oh and some cigars that go with it!

GoT is near enough a bloody 50 hour drama at this point! good though. 

As much of a Trekkie as I am, I've watched ToS once and I've kept it that way. I'm a massive fan of DS9 and I'm just working through Season 4 of a rerun on that. Quark angers me greatly.

I highly doubt in London that anything would happen to be honest. I do not understand how displaying these cartoons is not inciting hatred, Muslim preachers come under scrutiny for inciting hatred when all they are doing is exercising their free speech, to play devil's advocate, are they not doing exactly the same thing? It's all shit slinging and is a bit pathetic. If you want to challenge antiquated views, don't do it by stooping to their level. An exhibition showing images of western troops  helping citizens in Muslim countries, protecting them from the Muslim instigators of atrocities would be far more powerful in getting the message across that their religion has major flaws. I'm a little disappointed in the community on this thread as this discussion had the potential to be very interesting yet it has devolved into ""I hate Muslims because they're backwards, but muh freeze peach"" and anyone who has challenged their viewpoint has either been downvoted or had absolute bile spouted at them. There is no right or wrong on this topic, it is an incredibly sensitive subject and telling Muslims to suck it up and deal with it shows an intense disregard for their well being in our communities in the west. Seeing things like this has really opened my eyes and actually, yes I can see why some people feel marginalised and how they could end up in such a vulnerable state of mind which leaves them open for being taken in by extremist groups. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. Every Muslim I know in the UK (I live in an area where there are many Muslim communities, a lot of my neighbours are Muslims) adopts a ""your view is not my view, but that's ok"" approach and I do the same. I'm not going to start slamming my neighbour's beliefs because she wears a full burka, which I see as a symbol of oppression.

&gt; Know the feeling! Too warm and too much work. Covering three folks roles including my own this week and next. FUN.

Yeah. One of our team members threw a complete bloody strop this morning and threatened to sign his resignation letter. He's a nice lad but sometimes it's a bit like having the personification of Reddit sat two desks away.

&gt; It's never going to rain again. It feels that way anyway.

Don't know how the Spanish cope with it. Must drive them up the bloody wall.

Ah - classier than me. I've got Bacardi because I'm a huge Jessie.

&gt; Ahhh Judge Dredd. A proper police officer. He says, terrified of the concept. Seen the newest movie?

Karl Urban? Yeah. Made a better job of it than Stallone. The one thing they've not done (yet) is capture the sense of utter bloody silliness about the strip. Russians called 'Traktorfactori' for example. It's aimed at 15 year-olds, but the films give the impression they want it to be more like The Dark Knight when (largely) nothing could be further from the truth. It's got more in common with Vanquish magazine than Watchmen.

&gt; GoT is near enough a bloody 50 hour drama at this point! good though.

Yeah. An awful lot of bonking. I must say: I'm favour of bonking on TV.

&gt; As much of a Trekkie as I am, I've watched ToS once and I've kept it that way. I'm a massive fan of DS9 and I'm just working through Season 4 of a rerun on that. Quark angers me greatly.

Yeah it's The Incomparable's fault. I've been listening to back-issues of the show and they talked about TNG and how it compares to ToS and I realised I'd never watched ToS from start to finish. It's ... er ... OK.

Wow. I haven't played Civ since its original inception. Jesus I'm behind the times!

&gt; Not at work today then? I'm at work till 4 and then the lady is appearing, haven't seen her in a week as she's been on holiday!

null,false,Treczoks,null,null,null,"It can be worse... In ye olden days, our computer club HQ was in a garage. We had power, but no telephone service. So we asked the phone company for two lines. Waiting time: six months (as I said, olden days, and no competition to drive them).

About eight months later, some people turned up and dug a hole in the pavement, abot 10m from our garage. They set up barriers, signs, and lights, and left.

Two days later, another team showed up. They closed the first hole without doing anything in it, dug a second hole ony 5m from our garage, set up barriers, signs, and lights, and left.

Another two days later, a third team showed up and moved the hole again. But now right next to the garage, where it should have been from the beginning.

Next day, instead of a truck like before, a car shows up. Guy gets out, puts on a white helmet (here a sign of an engineer or architect on a building site), grabs a clipboard, and comes over to the current hole. He looks into the hole, examines the papers on his clipboard, looks in the hole again, marks something off on his clipboard, returns to his car, and leaves again.

Again one or two days later a small transporter arrives with two guys and the licence to solder. We get our hopes up that finally something might happen. We even ordered another two lines a few months ago, but they told us that their working orders were to put a cable with only two pairs, and that the order for the other two pairs had not reached their department yet, so they could not install a cable with four pairs.

To connect such a branch, they have a tool that cuts off the insulation off the big main cable that was running there, then they search for the right wires to connect the branch and install a normal-sized sleeve around this. But this time someone had set the cutting tool to the wrong setting, and it did not only cut the insulation but also one to two layers of the outer wires in the cable. A few dozen homes were without phone service. Now they had to make a bigger cut to fix the outer wires first, but they hadn't had the bigger sleeve they needed to re-seal everything. Getting the right sleeve, fixing the cables and finally adding the soon-obsolete two pairs branch cable took them a whole day.

A few days later, another team came, dug a trench through the neighbors garden (with his permission, of course) *nearly* to the place where a hole in the wall was needed to get the line trough. To our utter amazement, the same team also closed the hole in the pavement.

Aaaaand another guy came about a week later. His job was basically to drill a hole in the wall, push the cable trough and install the telephone socket. We had told them in advance that he would need a long drill, because the garden (which was about 1m higher than our garage, buried an old and thick foundation just under the lawn level, so he would have to drill through the garage wall and the foundation. We knew about this, because we had already run a cable through this wall to connect the neigbor to our local network. We had to cut a drill and weld a meter of rebar into it to drill the hole, so we knew what to expect.

So this guy brought a ""large"" drill (80cm long) which of course failed to get through. He rejected to use our drill or let us doing the drilling with it for safety/insurance reasons, so he left unfinished. Finally, about another week later, someone lese came and brough a sufficiently long drill and a gargantuan machine to plug it into, and we finally got our two lines installed! Horray!

Aftermath: Nobody cared about the trench in the neighbors garden, so two weeks later he complained to the phone company which had totally forgotten about this. Sometimes later, they actally fixed it, including rolled sod to fix the lawn.

A few days later we got the confirmation that the two other lines will be installed soon...

They were given all sorts of abuse online and accused of hampering the club by refusing to give up the ownership of the ground. The accusation was that they were hindering progress. Holding us back. The reality was that they saw the attempt to snatch the CPO's freehold over Stamford Bridge as an opportunistic, underhanded piece of subterfuge and quite rightly told the club to get fucked.

- From your every job experience remove 2 or 3 bulletpoints (the least relevant or the ones you've already mentioned sevaral times in different places)

- try to delete more bullet points from the jobs at the bottom of your CV (no one's going to read what you did in your job as a receptionist anyway...)

- Ideally you'd be left with 4-5 bullet points for your 2-3 most recent jobs and 2-3 bullet points for the rest.

I've had a few garages try and rip me off but I know enough to see through it. Women typically know less about cars so it's obvious that dodgy mechanics will try it on. 

My advice is to use a main dealer when you can, they charge a little more for the work but they often have fixed prices and might even price match another dealer. Also, if something doesn't go quite right they're more likely to fix it to keep you satisfied. Not all of them of course but it's more likely than John down the road. 

Plus, if something doesn't go your way you can complain to HQ. I once got my clutch and dual mass flywheel replaced under warranty even though my car was remapped. The dealership refused so I complained to the HQ and they approved the work the next day.

1. Save that 5% now for the next 16 pay periods. You'll have (5*16=) 80% of a single pay period saved up by Oct 2016.
1. When the workplace pension goes live make your first two months contributions 45% and live off the 80% you have saved.
1. After the second month reduce the contribution back to 5%.

3 years ago I took a new job, the advert said ""some European travel may be necessary"", but I've had jobs that have said that before and I'd never made it further than Slough.   This one was different, 3 weeks into the Job and I was asked to go to Poland, I think it was the 20th December.  Prior to that I'd only flown a handful of times and hated every minute of it, not quite terrified screaming in my seat, but certainly screaming on the inside.

so there I was, a week before Christmas queuing up to get on an EasyJet to Krakow trying not to shit myself.   I hated every minute of the flight and the couple next to me noticed how on edge I was, they swapped seats to the wife sat next to me and talked to me for the last 30 minutes of the flight about places to see if I had chance (She was polish and kinda hot).

Cut to this year, I've been all over Europe for work now, even bloody Russia in the winter, always flying on my own and now I can honestly say I love it, I'm excited to be on a plane, I love take off, I love landing, I mostly enjoy the flight (apart from the cattle class seats and shitty food), I even sat next to a woman who was crying because she hated it and calmed her down explaining what was happening with the plane.   I bloody love it.

I rate him. Seems to be a good player at the back and could cope with not being played week-in, week-out if he has the possibility to stay in the PL. He would surely get his games.

He's had a rough time but I think that he has shown that he is a good player. It would be cool, getting in another winger for depth and he probably does not cost a ton. He has a lot of Serie A experience but no PL experience... nonetheless, I think that he could be a good backup.  
  
**Giudetti.**  
He is still *quite* young and is a player who still has potential left in him. I don't know why everbody has given up on him - he maybe needs a surrounding that suits him well. He just won the U21 WC and he's played a good part in it. He reminds me of Rooney, physically... and of Zlatan when it comes to his character. I think that's a good thing. We need some more players with character. People who polarize. Not only everybody's darling players like Baines and Jags. A young prospective striker who can make a difference. Sign me up.

Only the web traffic of people using a browser that has complied with these key-length limits. Why does anyone with a sound mind think *for a second* that organised terrorist groups cannot just use a bespoke or modified version of a web browser? How hard do you think it is to fork webkit and fold in stronger encryption? AES256 is an open standard and is computationally unfeasible to break (unless you get lucky with a brute force).

Essentially though Reddit fired their AMA coordinator because she wasn't receptive to the attempts of management and admins to make the process more corporate and PR friendly.

From: https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq204d

&gt; Today, we learned that Victoria was unexpectedly let go from her position with Reddt. We all had the rug ripped out from under us and feel betrayed. 
&gt; 
&gt; Before doing that, the admins really should have at least talked to us (and all the other subs that host AMAs, like /r/Books, /r/Science, /r/Music, etc.) (Edit: not to suggest that we expect to know about Reddit's inner workings. Just that there should have been a transition in place or something worked out to ensure that Victoria's duties would be adequately handled, which they are not) We had a number of AMAs scheduled for today that Victoria was supposed to help with, and they are all left absolutely high and dry (hence taking IAMA private to figure out the situation) She was still willing to help them today (before the sub was shut down, of course) even without being paid or required to do so. Just a sign of how much she is committed to what she does. 
&gt; 
&gt; The admins didn't realize how much we rely on Victoria. Part of it is proof, of course: we know it's legitimate when she's sitting right there next to the person and can make them provide proof. We've had situations where agents or others have tried to do an AMA as their client, and Victoria shut that shit down immediately. We can't do that anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; Part of it is also that Victoria is an essential lifeline of communication. When something goes wrong in an AMA, we can call and get it fixed *immediately*. Otherwise, we have to resort to desperately try messaging the person via Reddit (and they may not know to check their messages or even to look for these notifications). Sometimes we have to resort to [shit like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg3b8/gabe_newell_ama_100_pm_pst/cftfbio) (now [with a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/UtV7fvg.png) because I can't link to that anymore for you) where we have to nuke an entire submission just so that the person is aware of the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Part of it is also organization. The vast majority of scheduling requests go through her and she ensures that we have all of the standard information that we need ahead of time (date, time, proof, description, etc.) and makes it easier for the teams that set up AMAs on both ends. She ensures that things will go well and that the person understands what /r/IAMA is and what is expected of them. Without her filling this role, we will be utterly overwhelmed. We might need to scrap the calendar altogether, or somehow limit AMAs from those that would need help with the process. 
&gt; 
&gt; We have been really blindsided by all of this. As a result, we will need to go through our processes and see what can be done without her.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tl;dr**: for /r/IAMA to work the way it currently does, we need Victoria. Without her, we need to figure out a different way for it to work.

null,false,sometimesihelp,null,null,null,"Pretty much this. There are mechanisms to buy back the property but they aren't always cheap. It also highly depends on what type of plan was used (and in the case of the home reversion plan how much was sold).

The following information is from Saga and hopefully at least gives you the gist of it.

&gt;
**What if I choose to pay off my equity release loan early?**
&gt;
An early repayment charge may have to be paid if you pay back part or all of your loan early.  A charge is not made when the loan is repaid following your death, when you move permanently into long-term care, or when you move home and transfer your mortgage. You will also not have to pay a charge if you are required to make a part repayment because you are moving to a home of lesser value and transferring your mortgage to your new home.
&gt;
**What is the situation on my death?**

The mods of /r/iama are ticked off because they'd been dumped in the dwang now since no-one has the time or resources to do the job that this admin used to do. So they've set /r/iama to private in protest and are demanding more communication between admins and moderators in future. Other subs are joining suit in solidarity.

the issue is not at all about whether this admin deserved to be sacked or not (which has been lost in the frenzy) and actually has nothing to do with the average reddit user (despite what 95% of the user base will say). It is purely a move by the major moderators to demand more communication about significant actions which could impact them.

The mods of /r/Liverpoolfc and /r/soccer have not made any official statement but have been removing posts demanding that they go private. We can assume this means they have no interest in joining the protest and should respect that decision. After all it has nothing to do with us.

&gt; Deal takes firm up to approximately 20% of UK motorbike insurance market.
Saga has bought motorbike broker Bennetts from BGL Group for £26.26m in cash.
The firm, which specialises in products for the over 50s market, highlighted that Bennetts has over 200,000 customers of which 43% are over 50 years of age.
It added that 77% are over 40 years of age but stressed that it will continue to serve bikers of all ages under the Bennetts brand.
The deal sees Saga buy the entire share capital of Bennetts which reported revenue of £17m and gross written premiums of £31m in the year ended June 2014.
Stable
The new owner's stable of insurance brands already included Saga and Direct Choice.
It already provided insurance for around 20,000 motorbikes and projected that together with Bennetts it will have a share of around 20% of the UK's motorbike insurance market
Lance Batchelor, group chief executive officer at Saga commented: ""We are delighted to add Bennetts to Saga's portfolio of highly-regarded brands.
""This fits with our strategic ambition to drive growth through our insurance broking operations. Bennetts sits perfectly within our business model: a capital light, cash generative business that will seamlessly integrate with our database to quickly deliver tangible returns.""
Model
Batchelor concluded: ""Our model works best where we can differentiate our service, leverage superior customer knowledge to tailor the best product for customers and create cross-selling opportunities.
""Bennetts will allow us to better meet the need for competitive bike insurance while also allowing us to increase our customer base.""",null,0,null,1435916967,null,0,false,0,csqv98t,null,t3_3bz0rq,null,t1_csqv98t,null,t1_csqv85c,null,null,null,1437549750,null,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3,null

When actors cross over it really fucks with you doesn't it? General Bingham in Edge of Tomorrow is Mad Eye Moody in Harry Potter. Edge of Tomorrow has Emily Blunt in as well... mmmmm Emily Blunt.

&gt; Yeah, but she's lumbered with really shitty dialogue. I get that they wanted an empath but they overlooked the fact that humans can already tell what someone else is feeling by looking at their face. Needed to have her be able to do more than just determine things that are already bleeding obvious.

that and she could understand never-met-before aliens and translate their emotions on some but not all of them. I couldn't stand her. 

Hey, not all of us can read emotions that way... so of us are the walking equivilant of cold hearted!

As it stands, people were promised something and, now they're in no position to prepare for the changes, they're being short-changed.

The honest, fair way, to transition to a non-'force' system would be to continue as is for those on the system, and give warning that the system will expire for new entrants in X years (so they can get saving/insuring themselves). 

In any case, the government don't have a mandate for ideological-type changes to the system.

Alright, not long woken up to be honest.

&gt; How's work?

Hot, sweaty and boring as I've been stuck in the warehouse for the week because there's too many people and not enough machines. If it hits 30 in there later I may go home. I do want to stay though and have one last fatty Friday with my shift as they were mostly a good bunch, just the one useless one.

&gt; What ya got planned?

Gliding hopefully, downside is I owe membership fees and flying fees so it'll be an expensive day tomorrow. On the upside, two free air shows in the next couple of weeks. Wales Nation and RIAT. Good times ahead. 

&gt; What spirits are you drinking?

None, I'm too much of a baby for spirits.

&gt; What beers you got in?

Becks, probably not to everyone's taste, but as a lager to have when you get in from work I find it's a good one.

&gt; Books, movies, parties, games what's on your radar right now?

Reading The Martian because the film trailer looked good. Really enjoying it so far. Going to read Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy trilogy again after that.

It has stripes down the side, and rings around the sleeves.

This seems to be the *exact* situation that the unnamed AMA-person was put in.

This isn't about expecting mods to be given an explanation or justification regarding *why* she was fired. Obviously, the reasoning behind it is confidential, but the fact she no longer works for them clearly isn't a secret (and could not possibly be).

I would also say that the moderators of a major subreddit like IamA should not be treated as ""the general public"" by Reddit's admins. They aren't paid or part of the company, but they are vital to the continued health of the company. Look at President Obama's AMA for example: a very high profile event for Reddit, made possible by the work of volunteers. Things like that bring in a great deal of new users and thus advertising revenue. Whatever the circumstances of Victoria leaving Reddit were, it created a situation that IamA mods (and mods of other subs which host AMAs) needed to deal with, and nobody bothered to give them a heads-up.

**EDIT:** I won't dispute that there are also people who, perhaps less reasonably, are very angry about the firing itself, or who, entirely unreasonably, think the community deserves a full explanation. She was certainly the most popular admin; some have claimed she was ""the only helpful admin"" or similar. My attitude would be that we will probably never know the reasoning behind it, and there is little point discussing it, but some people are convinced that it has something to do with yesterday's [disastrous AMA by the Reverend Jesse Jackson, who appeared to give bizarrely unrelated answers](https://web.archive.org/web/20150701163135/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3brf9s/i_am_rev_jesse_jackson_ama/).

My point is that, arguments over whether the firing itself was justified are a distraction, but nevertheless, the way Reddit handled the immediately aftermath deserves some criticism.

You're unlikely to see a ""tax bill"" as such since your earnings will be taxed at source (i.e. your company takes the tax and sends it off to HMRC; everything in you are actually paid is yours to keep).

In general though pension contributions are tax free - in a company scheme your contributions are usually taken before tax; if you pay into a personal pension separately using after-tax income then the scheme operator reclaims basic rate tax on your behalf.  If you're a higher rate tax payer things get a bit more complicated but you're a long way from needing to worry about that.

So yes, if you were to stick all of your salary above the personal allowance (£10600 for the 2015/16 tax year) into a pension then you would pay no income tax.  You'd still pay some National Insurance since the threshold on that is lower.  

I'd also echo /u/sometimesihelp's suggestion that it's worth doing a bit of reading on the tax system - the basics aren't that hard to understand and it'll help you make sense of your payslip if nothing else :)

null,false,Digital_Pigeon,null,null,null,"&gt;Relative poverty as a measure is only used within countries, not between them, so your entire point is spurious.

The point stands for domestic comparison as much as for international comparison. If I told a child living in poverty 'I'm going to end your poverty' and then proceeded to crash the economy, wiping enough money out of circulation to ensure that the median wealth fell enough that the family's wealth was now more than 60% then I would have technically ended poverty for that family without making things any better for them at all. 

&gt;It's based on decades of observation which suggest that the negative affects we associate with 'poverty' begin to kick in if you are on around 60%

Then why not just measure these negative effects? 

&gt; there would still be a median income in each country and some people would still earn below 60% of it, so it wouldn't end relative poverty by any definition.

You're wrong. We could end (relative) poverty by reducing the level of variation in wealth so that the poorest have more than 60% of the median. A more equal society would be great and is something we should be aiming for, but it has no relation to living standards whatsoever - to use an example, kicking the richest 20% out of the country would probably achieve this goal, but would not improve anyone's living standards. 

&gt; Clearly, absolute poverty would still exist in the event you suggest

Yes, exactly. What I'm trying to say is that relative poverty doesn't measure quality of life and is, therefore, a misleading term. ",null,0,null,1435919632,null,0,false,0,csqvv88,null,t3_3bvyxk,null,t1_csqvv88,null,t1_csqvjg7,null,null,null,1437550200,null,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0,null

If a normal employee was sacked so suddenly, the company would normally put in place provisions for their work to be covered, and at least tell their colleagues that they had let them go.

In fact, it's perfectly obvious it's not sexist, but Mensch can't help herself - she itches, she's seen a story that criticised a man for saying something sexist and now she'd *love* to be able to turn around and go ""No You"". 


I'll do the same thing here shall I, Mensch makes ridiculous and outrageous accusations about the other academics when she has *no idea* what they said. Maybe, like me, they thought that Tim Hunt's joke was a bad joke, in poor taste, made light of the real problems UCL has and showed a very poor attitude for someone representing the University. She doesn't know, but she'll happily *misreport* what they said. To top this off, her evidence? Comments on twitter. To quote Mensch on the topic 

&gt;What views? She cannot know them; at this stage she has only an unverified tweet 

See the sweet irony - Louise Mensch has assumed she knows exactly what took place because of a handful of tweets from peoples' personal accounts. 





Basically this goes on for ages - labouring under the fiction that direct quotes of what was said by numerous people in the room when Hunt made his comments aren't enough to know what he said. Labouring under the fiction that inappropriate jokes and negative comments can't be enough to dismiss someone from a PR role.  Comments which later turned out to be not only true, but *not joking*. He stood by those comments. Meanwhile Mensch seems to have this bizarre fantasy that UCL's process has got anything to do with Twitter and that individuals expressing personal opinions on twitter are direct and accurate recordings of whatever proceedings went on at UCL.  I *would* read through all those comments on twitter for Mrs Mensch, but at the end of the day *they're twitter comments* not court documents.

Which is why we use more than one measure of poverty. I've covered this already.

&gt;Then why not just measure these negative effects?

We already do. We also know that we can strongly predict all of them by taking this one measurement and using it as a benchmark. We can then move towards raising as many people as possible above that benchmark, then measure the other effects to see if we've actually been successful in our aims (e.g., have we raised life expectancy? Have crime rates fallen?).

&gt;You're wrong.

I'm wrong *if* you add a whole other part to your scenario that wasn't in there originally. By the way, where do you want these goalposts?

&gt;What I'm trying to say is that relative poverty doesn't measure quality of life and is, therefore, a misleading term. 

Relative poverty *does* measure quality of life. People who live below 60% of the median income have markedly worse quality of life than the rest of the population of their country, regardless of the material circumstances of that country.

For example, Brazil is a poorer country than the US. Yet, when you look at that 60% figure, you find that people who fall below it in the US are similarly vulnerable to people who fall below it in Brazil. This is despite the fact that people in the US generally have much better material circumstances (and national infrastructure) than do those in Brazil. This is why we use the 60% measure. It is an OECD measure, not one that Labour (or the Conservatives, when they believed in it back in 2006) just made up.

You are right that, because the measure uses a median, it fluctuates, and it does throw up some anomalies. However, it generally holds true as a useful measure of poverty.",null,0,null,1435920393,null,0,false,0,csqw1fk,null,t3_3bvyxk,null,t1_csqw1fk,null,t1_csqvv88,null,null,null,1437550302,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

So now consider the case where the energy industry is renationalised. We still have the same situation as pre-payment systems (coin meters) existed prior to privatisation. However, in this case the costs are just passed to the tax payer as a whole.

My beliefs for Scottish football can be summed up in 3 points

1) Keep talent in Scotland at all costs. Why? Improve the Scottish league at all costs even if that means selling talent to rivals. Failure to do so affects every team in Scotland (i would prefer Ciftci to play for Aberdeen than Celtic, but that doesnt seem to be an option)


2) the inherent belief that selling to a rival club or within your own league is a bad thing. Its not If Celtic are Strong it improves every other team in the league, if Aberdeen are strong it improves every other team in the league so on and so forth. We also all benefit from one clubs achievement outside Scotland these benefits can be seen in Co-efficient, monetary payments made to clubs as a result of a team performing well in europe and this is the attitude we all need to have to pull Scottish football out of the shit cobered mess it is in.


3) any club that takes the attitude that their individual needs is more important than the needs of us all is disgusting. In the grand scheme what will Ciftci do? We do not know, he could achieve nothing. Its the attitude that my individual needs (utd) are more than that of everyone that somehow worsening other teams makes me stronger (it may well do for a short period, but in the long term it wont) and this attitude is a disease. We need to look at improving Scottish football as a combined effort not some narrow-minded point of view that we should aim to weaken our opponents to make us look stronger. It will only make us.look stronger domestically not make us stronger overall.


Ultimately very few people agree with me but who cares we all have different beliefs on how to make football in Scotland better; mine are entrenched in the fact we shoild be looking to improve every team not lower the standards of those at the top.

Not very well – between 2008 and 2010 the UK’s levels of relative poverty decreased significantly. 

The financial crisis did not increase the quality of life of the poor in this country, nor did it reduce the number of poor people. What it did was reduce the overall wealth of the rich people causing the median wealth level to drop. Poor people got poorer but got told that they were no longer living in poverty.

Read the feedback on your assignments! I cannot stress this enough. Throughout my first year, I received bad mark after bad mark, but never stopped to consider why this was happening. The feedback on your work is there partly to help you stop making the same mistakes again. Read it carefully, and don't be afraid to sit down with your tutors and academic advisor to discuss any queries you might have.

I won't lie and say that I planned my work carefully and completed assignments long in advance - much of my coursework was written in caffeine-fuelled 3am sessions and most of my final dissertation was written over a prolonged week-long stay in the library. The key though is to make sure you work in a matter that suits you. Some people are incredibly organised and others are not, some people need the adrenaline rush of a rapidly approaching deadline and others do not. If you can find your groove early, you'll be alright when it comes to the critical assignments.

I don't think there are really any easy shortcuts; you do have to put in the extra effort and you have to push yourself.

I did a games design degree, slacked off for most of my first year, put in average effort in second and then worked like a demon in third. I can't say ""put in every hour of work that you can"" or ""don't party"" because that would be hypocritical, but here are the things I did that I think helped (it's quite design-specific but can probably apply to other fields to):

- Lecturers shouldn't be teaching you everything. This isn't school, the internet exists and you have no excuse for not learning the software skills you need (same for any programming course, imo). You have all the information in the world at your fingertips.

- Get involved with the industry. The more you are exposed to what real people in the profession are doing, the better you'll understand what good quality design is. Go to conferences. Network. Read about what's going on in your industry. It will pull up your standards.

- Be really critical. Ok, students aren't necessarily expected to produce industry standard work yet, but you *have* to learn what good design looks like and understand where your work needs improvement.

- You don't have to agree with what you say in your dissertation, you just have to tick the boxes. If you struggle with essay writing (or dyslexia, which affects a lot of people on creative courses), get support from the university, that's what it's there for.

- Don't leave deadlines until the last minute. Ok, it's kind of fun in the first year, I helped a few of my friends pull all-nighters, but in general I never understood why some people struggled so much to do their work in good time. If you're on an art course, you probably have a *lot* of time where you're not in lectures, it's not that hard. And if you don't have much time, you just have to get more organised.

We have the Taff Trail (part of NCN route 8), which pretty much cuts through the centre and continues down to the bay (south of the city). However, there is very little linkage from the residential areas, aside from a few bits of token paint (which usually puts you in conflict with left turning traffic). There is the odd segregated path but at some point you're kicked back onto a busy road, at best into a bus lane.

They have recently created a few 20mph zones and added wider cycle lanes (again paint), but to be honest traffic doesn't really taken any notice.

There's a few local campaigns (e.g. [Cardiff Cycle Campaign](http://www.cardiff-cycling-campaign.co.uk/) and [Cardiff Cycle City](http://www.cardiffcyclecity.org/#intro)) who are trying to improve things, particularly with the new Active Travel Wales Act which was passed by the Welsh Government. I'm not particularly hopeful as I've watched the local council make mistakes for years.

I cycle a fair amount in the city and you have to be fairly confident and brave. Less experienced riders seem to end up in a lot of dangerous situations due to where they're forced to ride. For recreational rides (i.e. you're happy to take your time, push the bike occasionally) it's not so bad, but if you actually want to get somewhere in a reasonable time it's not great unless you're comfortable cycling with aggressive traffic.

You want a suggestion for improving Scottish football?  How about Celtic sell, or at least loan, all their top players to other Scottish clubs?  Your squad is strong enough that you'd probably still win the league and every other team is strengthened.  Start this week (we'll call dibs on Craig Gordon) and it'll help Aberdeen and St Johnstone next Thursday and improve the coefficient.

It's nonsense, isn't it?  So is everything you've said.  How does Dundee United weakening themselves to Celtic's benefit strengthen both teams?  We saw it last season when Aberdeen signed McLean from St Mirren.  It doesn't.

That you can write this:

&gt;not some narrow-minded point of view that we should aim to weaken our opponents to make us look stronger.

Even in context, while arguing for Dundee United weakening themselves to make Celtic look stronger is completely ridiculous.

Dundee United do not exist for the benefit of Celtic Football Club.  The only team that exists for the benefit of Celtic Football Club are Celtic Football Club.

Why don't you just admit that what I wrote above is the truth.  You think Celtic have the right to any player from any other Scottish team you want and you're upset that Dundee United, rather than being good little boys and behaving, have had the balls to stand up to you.",null,0,null,1435925255,null,0,false,0,csqxax4,null,t3_3byznk,null,t1_csqxax4,null,t1_csqw6uo,null,null,null,1437551089,null,12,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,12,null

The next one can be hard to find but when you do its worth it a little on the strong side at 75.5% Old J Tiki Fire. Or if you are not a fan of the overproof stuff then Old J is a decent enough drink.

Now if we go into the world of decent sipping rum that is dark and more subtle in spice Goslings Black Seal rum is good. In both its usual and overproof versions, Pussers Navy rum. Both of these are dark and have the more molasses taste, I always say think rum and raisin ice cream.

So now golden, generally lighter but this is where for my money the best rums are located. Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva. Start here. I know non rum drinkers who love this stuff. One of my favourites. Matusalem 15 Gran Reserva is lovely as would be expected from a rum this old.
Havana Club Seleccion de Maestros is probably my favourite of the Havana Club stuff, its a barrel strength rum so much like a cask strength whisky. Lovely drink.

Mount Gay XO is lovely, these are all rums that should be treated like a good single malt. Pyrat XO also good to drink.

None of these break the £40 barrier (just in is the Diplomatico).

I would suggest a bottle of the Diplomatico and a bottle of Kraken. And a drink I have come up with for the Kraken is lovely in this weather is in a tall glass fill with ice and then add 50ml of Kraken, juice of half a lime, half fill with coke and then top up with D&amp;G Old Jamaice Ginger beer or if you can find it ginger beer berry twist.",null,0,null,1435925636,null,0,false,0,csqxexk,null,t3_3byw04,null,t1_csqxexk,null,t1_csqutou,null,null,null,1437551156,null,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1,null

Some parts are improving but there is a huge legacy of miles of substandard-width lanes, created by painting a white line on the road.  These are worse than no lane at all because it restricts the cyclist to a ghetto in the gutter with the broken glass and pot holes, while implying to motorists that it is safe to pass right next to the line.  In places where the cycle lanes have been thought through properly, they are better and sometimes actually useful.

I live 8 miles out of town to the west, and cycle in daily.  It's not good.  There are no cycle paths at all for the first 1/2 of my journey (not that it stops some car drivers shouting at me to get on the non-existent cycle path - cretins), then there is a mile of dashed lines, which I hate, before the pavement turns into a cycle path.  I should be satisfied with that, right?  Well, once you are on the pavement the priorities at junctions change and you have to give way regardless of the road layout.  This is annoying at best and dangerous at one particular junction, being at the bottom of a steep hill with very poor visibility round the corner where the cars whoosh off the main road to the left.  When the traffic isn't too bad, I prefer to stay on the road to avoid some of these junctions.  One section is also in extremely poor repair and I have actually broken a wheel on it.  Again, I now use the road past that bit.

Oh yes, I forgot - those dashed lines on the road I encounter on my cycle in?  They create a cycle path so narrow in places that there isn't enough room to fit the cycle symbol in, so 1/2 of its front wheel is missing.

&gt;__E-diesel__ is the name of [synthetic diesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_fuel) created by [Audi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi) to be used in automobiles. Currently, an e-diesel variant is created by Audi research facility in partnership with a company named Sunfire. The fuel is created from [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) and water with a process powered by [renewable energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy) sources to create a liquid [energy carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_carrier) called __blue crude__ (in contrast to regular [crude oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil)) which is then refined to generate e-diesel. E-diesel is considered to be a [carbon-neutral fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-neutral_fuel) as it does not extract new carbon and the energy sources to drive the process are from carbon-neutral sources. As of April 2015, an [Audi A8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A8) driven by [Federal Minister of Education and Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_Education_and_Research_(Germany\)) in Germany is using the e-diesel fuel.

null,false,Firefox7275,null,null,null,"Consult your GP because the best products are prescription only. You do not need a dermatologist, GPs are more than capable of spotting and treating acne, rosacea or contact dermatitis (pimples are not necessarily acne).

Check our our ingredients Wiki and mega reviews in the sidebar, also the article on sun protection. Most of the products from my [rosacea friendly routine] (https://onwrinklesandrosacea.wordpress.com/2015/06/22/rosacea-core-routine-challenge-uk-edition/) would be fine for acne vulgaris, contact dermatitis or atopic eczema.

Given you have sensitive eczematous skin all your choices should be guided by that. Avoid harsh anionic surfactants (sulphates/ olefin sulfonates), fragrance, anything alkaline, drying alcohol, most essential oils. The Biore cleanser is based on SLES and the Botanics toner on drying alcohol so I would switch these out first; the Clinique balm and Garnier cleanser look OK.

Research shows eczematous skin is low in [urea] (http://www.evidence.nhs.uk/formulary/bnf/current/13-skin/132-emollient-and-barrier-preparations/1321-emollients/preparations-containing-urea) and ceramides so look for these. Your current prescription cream is just a super basic emollient, you might ask if you can switch to Eucerin face cream with 5% urea, CeraVe PM lotion for ceramides and 4% niacinamide/ nicotinamide, or Balneum Cream with 5% urea and 0.1% ceramides (not the Balneum Plus which is different).

[Niacinamide/ nicotinamide]  (https://www.evidence.nhs.uk/formulary/bnf/current/13-skin/136-acne-and-rosacea/1361-topical-preparations-for-acne/other-topical-preparations-for-acne/nicotinamide/nicam) is on prescription for acne tho Nicam gel does have alcohol so my skin didn't do too well with it. Urea can gently exfoliate as it hydrates, it also has some anti bacterial properties so any of these moisturisers are useful in both acne and eczema.

I would not personally recommend Stridex (SLS and menthol) nor the Simple moisturising wash (SLES). Cutting these harsh cleansing agents out of ALL my products (including hair and dental care) meant my eczema healed, my skin generally became more hydrated/ less oily on the T zone, fewer incidents of contact dermatitis. [This article] (http://www.eczema.org/aqeous) was the lightbulb moment for me.

Yes, prescription drugs are funded by the UK taxpayer. But this is done according to an allocation of funds determined by us, the voters. The NHS is the vehicle by which we have chosen to have our health services delivered to us. It is not a charity, it is not a gift from government and our prescriptions are not given at Jeremy Hunt’s largesse. There is no educational message here; everyone in the UK knows about the nature of the NHS. How is it supposed to make you feel when your cancer drugs cost thousands of pounds. Grateful? Pampered? Guilty? Greedy? If your pills have to bear a stamp, what about “wishing you better”?""

It's not as hard or expensive as you'd think, and it's not all or nothing, you can do as little or as much as you like. Start by getting yourself the Haynes manual for your car. Combine that with DIY write ups online, and youtube is a goldmine of howto videos for auto repair.

So I did a four year MEng in Computer Science at a Russell Group University and received a strong First in each year, climaxing with 90% in my final (Masters) year.

My advice is to understand clearly what needs to be learnt and understood to receive good marks.  At my Universtiy the majority of marks were from exams.  When you know what needs to be known, get a small group of good, intelligent friends, sit down and then learn every single thing that needs to be learnt (easy, huh?).  Most modules divide nicely into about 5-15 sections, learn each section; do spot tests on each other until you've all both memorised and fully understood something.  You know you understand something when you can teach it to someone.

Now of course, this will take time, it's not instant to learn an entire module so the most important thing is to dedicate time to this.  Working in a small group usually helps for testing yourselves but some prefer to read the material on their own before-hand.

When it comes to coursework, the trick is to start immediately and get as much feedback as is permitted from as many people as possible to make your work as good as possible.

If you're going to leave everything to the last minute (as some of you inevitably will do), make sure you still work together to test each other.  It's so easy to miss topics or misunderstand things when working alone.

&gt;The __Victoria Rooms__, also known as the __Vic Rooms__, houses the [University of Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bristol)'s music department in [Clifton, Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton,_Bristol), England, on a prominent site at the junction of Queens Road and Whiteladies Road. The building, originally [assembly rooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_rooms), was designed by [Charles Dyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dyer_(architect\)) and was constructed between 1838 and 1842 in [Greek revival style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Revival_architecture), and named in honour of [Queen Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria), who had acceded to the throne in the previous year. An eight column [Corinthian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_order) [portico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portico) surmounts the entrance, with a classical relief sculpture designed by [Musgrave Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musgrave_Watson) above. The construction is of dressed stonework, with a slate roof. A [bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze) statue of [Edward VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII), was erected in 1912 at the front of the Victoria Rooms, together with a curved pool and several [fountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain) with sculptures in the [Art Nouveau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau) style.

On average the prescription tax in England and Wales[1] exceeds the cost of the medication dispensed against it -- most generics are surprisingly cheap. (A course of amoxycillin or a month's worth of bendroflumethiazide costs less than a penny a dose.) This scheme applies only to more expensive drugs.

To my eyes, it looks like a manipulative exercise in applied cognitive psychology, to soften the public up for the idea of abolishing NHS prescriptions and bringing in private prescriptions. Customers won't notice the cheap unlabelled items; they'll only remember the ones that stick in their mind because they're surprisingly expensive. Private prescriptions won't be price-labelled, and will be paid for in the postulated ToryCare system by insurance companies. So the perception will gradually build up that NHS prescriptions are expensive, while private ones are ""free""[2] ...

Sometimes lower maintenance doses of isoretinoin are used to reduce the side effects and maintain the results, but this would require a GP referral to a hospital dermatologist.

Cystic acne tends to respond poorly to topicals, so IMO his first port of cal should be his GP. They may well want to prescribe oral antibiotics with or without topicals. Many of these are photosensitising (increase sun damage) so sunscreen is very important. The obvious choice would be whichever broad spectrum product he used when on isotretinoin.
 
What is his full routine, all products including anything related to shaving? If he likes foaming washes the Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Wash gel is well liked around here. He might also purchase some more pillowcases so they can be hot washed every day or two. Ditto launder towels and wash cloths frequently.

Final thought is to review his diet and lifestyle choices, since cystic acne is often more of an internal issue and, given your boyfriend's age, probably hormonal. He should ensure he consistently meets or exceeds ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle. Oily fish is particularly important for the long chain omega-3s and bioavailable vitamin D, and experts advocate up to four servings a week.

null,false,bluelagoonintorquay,null,null,null,"I'm Asian (Sikh), came here at 18 as an overseas student to study Computer Science, 34 now.  In that time I've managed to acquire undergraduate and PhD degrees from Cambridge, started, ran and sold a company, and am now in the process of building out a second company which looks like it will exit in 18 months.

The good:
1. By and large (not always) I've been treated with tolerance, I don't feel like I've been discriminated against in a professional sense due to my skin colour or background.
2. I appreciate this country has a lot of opportunities for those looking to better themselves, learn about things or acquire skill. 
3. There are a heck of a lot of bright people here, and a heck heck of a lot of passionate people.
4. I'm not a traditional thinker wrt my cultural background.  This place gave me the space to be away from that. 

The bad:
1. I feel very discriminated against socially.  Dating, integration, family has always been a barrier because I realise that, by and large, tolerance stops at interacting with the person. There is no desire to take it further and in more than one instance I've had partners leave me because parents, family or friends looked down on their dating a non-native. 
2. There still seems to be this backbone thread that Non-European means second-class.  For me at least, I tend to see a lot of resentment that I've done OK.  There are also a lot of really prejudiced assumptions that seem to exist regarding the success of non-whites. 
3. I hate the direction the country is taking as a whole.  More xenophobia, more inequality, throwing away the interests of the next generation, speculation on land and property, forcing young professionals into rental and professional servitude.  A general ""I'm alright Jack"" platitude.  I feel like Britain has lost its character.

Overall I am thankful for the opportunities this country provided but am under no illusion that I paid above-market price for access to those opportunities (whether financially or personally).  I consider myself as having a good working relationship with the country and no more. 

In 18 months when I exit the second time around I'll leave for the Bay Area. Based on personal and professional experience I believe it's much easier to integrate and be part of a mosaic there, I am appreciated more on a professional and social level and I will have the luxury of not having to worry about money. 

In a nutshell, it's been good, but it's time to move on. 

EDIT: I should point out I feel sad about this. I came to the UK instead of the US because my impression was that Britain was more inclusive than the US (based on the fact I came from an ex-colony, I was more familiar with it, the image portrayed by the UK outside it's borders, etc).

Whereas 123 Santander account pays 3% interest. So you're effectively gambling. 

£1000 in Santander will get you £30. take that a go buy 15 lottery tickets. Better value.

The other thing is bonds are in theory the safest form of saving, for them not to pay out means the country is so in the shite losing your savings is the least of your worries.

Italy - No

What do all these leagues do have in common is Quality; the quality of the players within these leagues out strips everyone else.

Scotland currently consumes more domestic football per capita than any other country in europe (last time I checked anyway). So improving the market share of football in Scotland will have little benefit. What we need to improve Scottish football is to improve neutral viewership

Neutral viewership: People who watch football as entertainment but couldnt really be fussed with the end result. 

How do you improve neutral viewership? Improve the quality of the league.

How do you improve the quality of the league? Retain good players in Scotland at all costs.

&gt; Based on an average shirt price of £40 for a short-sleeved adult shirt, revenues from shirts alone are worth approximately £60million a year to Real Madrid and Manchester United and £35m to the other leading Premier League clubs.

This is based on data up to 13/14, where we sold an average of 875,000 shirts annually. Lets say this increased to 1 million this season. That's revenue of £40,000,000.

Using your figure of 20% margin per shirt (I suspect it's less, but I don't have the data) that's a profit of £8,000,000 from shirt sales across the *entire season*.

Already, £8mil doesn't cover his wages, let alone his loan fee on top of that. And that's if he sold *every single Chelsea shirt* for the next season.

The 40% of United's shirts figure is indeed impressive - I'm not saying Falcao doesn't have marketing pull - but again, how many people would've bought a shirt anyway, and got Falcao on the back because he was an exciting new signing? This further reduces the impact a player signing can have on shirt sales.

Overall, I'd be surprised if he pays for more than a few weeks of his salary.

FYI, Perez and Madrid don't buy players to sell shirts.

I am Alessandro Ugo, Cinematographer at Focal Rhythm Productions, an Audio and Video Production house London based.

I also currently work at SAE London, a filmmaking university Shoreditch based, and direct an international reality-talent show. 

I have experience in camera operating and photography for years, developing a keen sense of the image, but at the same time I can be as much creative as you need. 

Working everyday with professional film equipment, I have gained a wide and efficient knowledge of most of digital cameras and lenses, based on a strong workflow. 

In my experience I've worked many times on events and lives.

I am also a Steadicam Operator, and upon request I can provide a full rig. 

I own my personal camera, the new Black Magic Cinema Camera 4K, and related LanParte full rig.

Any illusions that Google is still ""not evil"" should not be held onto. Google exists to make money, MS exist to make money, they will both act largely rationally towards their goal of earning as much money as possible, and so both will happily screw the users if that makes money, also both will happily treat the users perfectly, if that makes more money.

I really can't see any end-game for the private subreddits aside from just going back to being public, there's no way that Victoria is going to get reinstated, and the reddit leadership have shown themselves to be incompetent enough to just plough on ahead.

It seems to me that there are so many lurkers and random browsers on reddit who don't care about all this and just want to see cat pictures and read made up stories on /r/funny that the reddit management probably doesn't actually care if they lose a few percent of the older userbase who're more time-invested in the site since they'll keep the silent, uncaring majority and if they can actually start making real money from reddit then losing a few noisy percent of their userbase isn't really that harmful to them.

What's she so bad? Understanding reddit, essentially. She hadn't been running the joint long when she essentially came out with the stunningly corporate friendly ""We want to be a safe platform"" and admitted that that was the priority over free expression. Now, while I know a lot of people would say ""Yeah that sounds reasonable"", a lot of people want as hands off an approach as possible on reddit from the powers that be, and want anything which is *legal* to remain, afterall if you don't like it, just don't subscribe to that sub, and use your downvotes. Reddit began as a place where morally ""bad"" content would be allowed, because who decides what's morally bad?

Her handling of the shut down of FPH (which, imo shouldn't have happened) was awful, her attitude towards the community was ""If you don't agree I don't care"" and she showed actual disdain for much of the userbase in her responses to people. This is unsurprising given she's known as a bit of a ""I'm doing what's right and fuck you"" character in the business world, but of course with reddit where there are lots of opinions about ""what is right"", that doesn't please people.

Finally, she's now sacked Victoria without any warning or prior discussion about what's going on with the community, so essentially she's continuing to treat the reddit user-base solely as an asset (which we are) instead of as human users (which we also are). She's clearly used to running a business where the CEO makes decisions and everyone does it, which is how most companies do function, but what she doesn't seem to realise is that with reddit, we are the product, but our acceptance and enjoyment of her decisions affects their income, and so they need to pay a high level of respect to those things.",null,0,null,1435931460,null,0,false,0,csqzinc,null,t3_3bzoop,null,t1_csqzinc,null,t1_csqz8q1,null,null,null,1437552610,null,10,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,10,null

Combine this with the aforementioned shirt sales, expansion of Chelsea as a brand in Colombia/south America and the deal starts to cost very little.

Provided an arrest necessity exists, as per the the post-SOCPA amendment to PACE. Even if the owner of the car made an allegation (and assuming that he's not about to be nicked for causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal), you'd be hard pushed to justify an arrest under those circumstances unless something else is in play.

If the rescuer has a verifiable name and address and there's no suggestion that this is something other than a rescue attempt (so there's nothing to be gained from an interview), then an arrest is very unlikely, unless the rescuer happens to be known for theft from and happens to be clutching a wallet with someone else's name. And there's no dog and it's in the middle of the night.

&gt;Additionally, police only need reasonable grounds to suspect you have committed an offence in order to arrest you

Strictly speaking, you commit an offence if you attempt to board a train before everyone has got off, yet nobody is in fear of the old bill turning up and nicking them for it (although there's a first time for everything...)

Put it another way - would you rather wait for a police response (which might well be an hour away), or would you rather watch the dog die? 

&gt;being immune from criminal consequence does not make you immune from physical injury when the vehicle's 24-stone 6'6"" owner sees you smashing his window.

And nothing is guaranteed to get a crowd of bystanders on your side more than a dog in a hot car. I don't like this trend of saying 'let the police deal with it' because a) there are fewer than you'd think and you could be waiting a while, and would you want to let a dog die because you're too paralysed by 'what-ifs' to act and b) whatever happened to a bit of old-fashioned common sense and a belief in civic duty?

It'd be nice if the Animal Welfare Act 2006 contained an amendment to allow any person to rescue a dog from a car (in fact, I feel a letter to my MP coming on), but even without it, no one rescuing a dog has anything to fear from the police.

as i said, when you look at this in the context of this government's other policies and overall agenda, it's clearly another policy to try and redefine public services and our NHS as a privilege rather than a right. they're doing the same thing with almost every aspect of our public services, and it's got very little to do with saving money, it's about the conservative ideology.",null,0,null,1435932647,null,0,false,0,csr0163,null,t3_3bzbac,null,t1_csr0163,null,t1_csqzvnl,null,null,null,1437553022,null,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0,null

I must admit that, even though I am from Australia and I have a British wife, and I've lived in the UK before, it was a culture shock to actually settle down here for the long term. Lots of little things are different. Some are better, some are worse. I simply learned to love the British things and focus on what Britain has to *offer* rather than what it *lacks*.

I love the British weather because I prefer a colder climate, and I like how the seasons are more extreme here.   I think it's great to walk through ice and snow to get somewhere. Eventually the novelty will wear off, I guess.

I used to live in Sydney, so I miss city things. e.g. good restaurant and cafes, but the major cities have all that.

I miss the isolation of Australia. e.g. I can go for a walk somewhere like this: http://www.ubmbc.org.au/photos/slider/oronga.jpg and never bump in to anyone else. Sydney is very fortunate in that it's a major city surrounded by rugged bushland.

But I love the British countryside, the green, the lakes and rivers, the luscious vegetation, hedges, woodland, canals, towpaths ...  the list goes on. 

House prices were a disappointment. I was hoping to have some relief from Australian house prices but they seem to have followed me! But, the quality of the newer builds are better than most Australian house but they are a LOT smaller. Swings and roundabouts.

I've had no problem making friends here. Australian culture is very similar to British culture and there are very few language problems.  Also, British people tend to *love* Australia and are very warm to Australians in general. I'm sure this has helped, and everyone who has an Australian connection loves to tell me about it - which is a nice thing.

Maybe you should go and join them? Your world view appears very similar.

&gt;9/11 was - at least partly - blowback from CIA anti-Soviet operations.

No it wasn't. There was a civil war in Afghanistan after the Soviets left, and the Taliban won. They were friendly with AQ and allowed them to set up shop in their country. We can only speculate what would have happened if the U.S. didnt arm guerrilla factions against the Soviets, but chances are they would've withdrew sooner or later anyway, leading to the same inevitable civil war for power and influence. Regardless, AQ had their own agenda and it was entirely separate from the war with the Soviet Union.

Yes, and this is a good idea, it's just not a good idea to define it by comparing it to *median* income. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t measure poverty by the income of the person in question – I’m saying that whether you live in poverty or not has got nothing to do with how big of a bonus a bunch of rich bankers had this year. If my next door neighbour loses his job that doesn’t lift me out of poverty, but the current relative poverty measure says that it does. 

Obviously the international level of absolute poverty wouldn’t apply here – we should have a separate one which reflects the costs of living in the UK.

Go to lectures. My course also had practical classes (even more than lectures) so go to them if your course has them. All of them. Don't skip anything if you can help it. If you need to take notes, do it.

If you are doing badly and you feel as though you are giving it your all on all of your modules then adapt to a triage strategy, focus on certain modules over others to boost some of your grades over others. I'd only advise this if you are burning out. That being said always submit coursework (if you have coursework for that module) on time for every module as every mark can help.

If you are working on something at uni and need to go home or are starting to get bored, go home and do it there if you can after a break, don't burn out.

Study/Research/Work on Coursework in your spare time when you can, but obviously live a little. I'm probably not the best example for this tip as I spent hardly any time studying/researching in my spare time and more time (all of it :P) playing video games. But I did do my coursework whenever inspiration struck or as soon as I personally started to feel like I was falling behind.

If your coursework has a marking spec, read it. Tick off things you have done and mark things you haven't done. Don't submit a coursework until you can safely say you've done everything or enough of the spec. After you're satisfied with regards to the coursework spec, only then do something that isn't on the spec that makes your submission unique as by doing the coursework you should have learned enough to experiment so do that to elevate your submission from good/B territory into great/A territory. Don't do what some people on my course did (and I did at the start of my honours project! :D )  and bite off more than you can chew at the start of a coursework and then burn out and have nothing to submit rather than a solid base that would have picked you up some marks.

As difficult as it is, do not procrastinate. If you feel like you need to do something then last week was the best time to do it, right now is the second best time, not tomorrow, not the weekend, now. Time you spend not doing coursework or revision or research or study is time you need to make up later at the end which ends up being all night crunches, which does no good for yourself physically and mentally, especially before exams.

On that note. Sleep. 

In exams, focus on what you know for definite, read questions carefully but quickly, if you don't know it move on and come back.

Above all, enjoy your course, if you don't like what you are doing then purely by nature you won't put as much effort in to succeed.

The time concern would be easy to explain.

I never realised that being opinionated shone through so clearly. Thanks for that! I'll have to re-word that in a more tactful manner.

Again, thanks for pointing out the emphasis on leadership. I've honestly performed these volunteer roles to enhance my experience and hopefully learn new skills to benefit my development.

&gt;Justification for killing 3 thousand civilians in terrorist attacks in your world?

I think that if Britain were a vicious dictatorship and one of our historical enemies did a deal with our dictator to install military bases on British soil then there would be likely to be some British people who were extremely well motivated to go and attack that enemy.

Look at the players who you signed from rivals and rotted them on the bench for a few years. That isn't good for Scottish football.

Since 2010/11 the personal allowance has been phased out once income exceeds £100,000. It disappears at the rate of £1 off the personal allowance for each £2 of income above £100,000. So an extra £2 of income is taxed at 40% and also brings down the personal allowance by £1. That brings another £1 of income into tax charged at 40%. So a £2 rise in income results in £3 being taxed at 40% which is £1.20. So £2 of income results in extra income tax of £1.20 which is a rate of 60%.

The marginal rate continues until the personal allowance disappears. In 2014/15 that happens as income hits a little more than £120,000. Above that the marginal rate reverts to 40%.

Know your details. When it comes to exams, don't just trot out the same facts as everyone else, have a bit of extra insight or detail on something that'll set you apart.

If you have to do an individual study, do something off the beaten path. I've been marking 2nd year archaeology presentations recently, and by far the most interesting are the people choosing sites that haven't been already covered in seminars or have had dozens of books written about them.

Time management is *crucial*. Not just making sure you get things in on time, but making sure that you give yourself enough time to do proper research, draft and edit properly. If you get swamped, you'll rush and cut corners.

if you're going to approach everything with such a strong pre-conceived notion of what is happening you are going to reliably be wrong a lot. its equivalent to claiming that all Labour are trying to do is take money away from rich people to spend it on 'society'.

FYI the idea of 'nudging' public behaviour into more efficient / productive / responsible outcomes is a very popular political idea at the moment - everyone's read the book: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0141040017/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435934720&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=nudge - its actually very good (thats where our workplace pension policy is likely come from https://quarterly.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/22/how-a-small-nudge-is-helping-people-save-for-their-retirement/). This policy looks extremely like the continuation of these ideas - use information and non-mandatory actions to improve behaviour i.e. don't prevent people from accessing medicine, just inform them to encourage lower waste. That is where this policy has come from, and where many more will come from - not an evil preconditioning of the gullable public for privatisation. not to say that there aren't people that want to do that.

Sorry, dude.  Don't know about Google, but it's definitely a thing.  I literally have no other defense other than this.  An argument based on your inability to believe something as true is a logical fallacy any day of the week.  ""Because I've never seen a decent US player, then a young kid that a Prem team is buying must be shit"" is a very flawed logical argument.

&gt;Also, basing future expectations on past performance is quite reasonable.  There's a whole field of science called ""statistics"" based on this, if you've heard of that.

Agreed, except when dealing with completely different people.  If this Lennon kid was shit before, then we can assume he won't improve much.  But, saying that because Freddy Adu was shit suggests that Lennon will also be shit is false.  


While it's true that certain countries have historically had better players, that doesn't mean that someone from another country can't be successful.  I can't even believe I'm arguing with you about this.  If you told me that you had a 16-year-old soccer prodigy, and I were to place a bet on where he's from, statistics would tell me not to bet on USA.  100% agree.  But, if you were to tell me that you had a 16-year-old *American* soccer prodigy, and I had to place a bet on whether or not this was true, then statistics don't help at all.  They tell you nothing about future outcomes in an either/or situation involving completely different people.

&gt;And xenophobe doesn't mean thinking athletes from a country are poor performers based on evidence.

You're right again!  Except that one definition of xenophobic does mean that you have an irrational dislike of certain countries, which, judging by OP's comment, he does.  Maybe he doesn't hate America in general, but thinking that all soccer players from X country are shit is pretty fucking xenophobic if you ask me.

My guess is that the kerfuffle will slowly subside, but if it doesn't and there's an outbreak of concerted disobedience by users and mods, e.g. a more organised and widespread darkening of subs, then I'd certainly want the bar staff to consider it.

Bullshit. Are you seriously saying that the financial crisis increased poor people’s ability to pay their bills? 

If your poverty can be ended without there being any change in your circumstances then it’s not a real measure of poverty, it’s just a measure of your wealth in comparison to others. You could take a third world country and say that they don’t live in poverty because they’re all equally poor. 

Poverty should be a measure of the hardship you face in your life. If it’s just a relative measure of wealth then we could say that a millionaire lives in relative poverty in comparison to a billionaire.

I think he performed fine last season, nothing stellar but definitely not one of the worst on the team.

For his age and relative experience, he managed to adapt to the Premier League quite quickly and has been a very useful player due to his ability to play in multiple positions. I think he operated effectively in the back 3, especially alongside Skrtel and Sakho, but was often caught off guard and made several mistakes. Even more so in the full-back position.

I think he will be a bench player, but will get chances in the Europa League and Cup games. Just don't see him displacing Milner/Henderson in midfield. I hope he is never put in the DM position because he isn't a DM by any definition! He isn't a great long passer, doesn't really link up the defence and attack so isn't an effectively regista/deep-lying playmaker, and also is not defensively apt enough to be a destroyer.

Does Willian have room to improve? Absolutely. But hes 6 years younger than Ribery, and offers substantially more than Bale does for the team. If the team is improved around him (right back), I think it will allow Willian to grow more and build on the second half of this season.

null,false,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,null,"Man, things really go to shit while I sleep. Anyway, moderator response time!

First of all, clarification (in as short as possible):

The protest that several subreddits have taken up is about the admin's respect for the website and the communication they have with the thousands of un-paid volunteers who put hours in to help run it. Reddit's firing of Victoria (/u/Chooter, who organises AMAs) merely acted as the catalyst that started it off and is not the main reason for it (although the circumstances around it, i.e. destroying current/upcoming AMAs on several huge subs, act as a prime example).

This is not something that most users will clearly see, but is something that a lot of moderators are pissed off about. We've contacted the admins numerous times in the past for clarifications on rules (both the big site ones and the one or two they've caused us to implement ourselves) and other matters and have heard nothing. We also have terrible moderation tools and the majority of us rely upon a third-party extension to do it half-properly. There are several other random things that, rather pointlessly, make moderation harder. All we've had from the admins are a bit of reddit gold and, so far, empty promises of improvements.

Unfortunately, while people are correct that we don't do them, AMAs are something that we've always wanted to get into here for a looooong time. Hell, we originally planned to do a load for the 50th but lacked time to organise it. We have already communed with Victoria about it in the past, but with her dismissal, this is put into an unknown situation. A bad place to be in when series 9 is just around the corner!

null,false,Ewannnn,null,null,null,"Yet the net result is worse for the poor if it means less money to spend on tax credits &amp; welfare. I explain: by raising the income tax threshold you get less revenue from everyone earning below £100k. Before the threshold change, someone earning £10k would have paid say £2k in tax (let's assume the threshold was £0k before &amp; £10k after) but received £10k in benefits for a total income of £18k after tax. Someone earning £50k would have paid £2k on their first £10k in income but they would have received no benefits / tax credits. So now we're not getting that £2k from all those people earning £50k any more, this means we have less money to spend on benefits for those on low incomes. All of a sudden the government has decided they must cut benefits &amp; the low income earner on £10k now only receives £5k in benefits for an income of £15k after tax. 

So a system which was implemented to help the poor actually helps the middle income percentiles. If you leave the tax threshold at zero but redistribute the money it's always going to be better for low income earners. If your goal here was to take low income earners out of income tax you wouldn't put the threshold for avoiding the tax bill at £100k, you'd put it at the median income if my thinking is correct.

I think some ethnic Indians born in the UK tend to see themselves as ""superior"" to those not born here because they feel being born British means they have some special endowment or power that makes them more interesting, capable and intelligent.  In their minds there is no better place and nobody from outside (of ethnicity) can be better because this is the Mecca of the world. The terms ""freshie"", ""boatie"", etc are casually thrown around and remarks are made about dressing, accent, etc all designed to put down the receiver.  It's almost as if they have no sense of self-worth and no self-identity and so derive it from being crap to others and asserting their Britishness respectively.  When it's proven, by example, their view of themselves is wrong, they don't like it. 

Secondly, nothing is ever their fault. If they spent their teenage years smoking dope and now they are unemployable it's the state's fault. There is no sense of personal responsibility. My personal opinion is that a lot of these people had parents who worked to the ground to give them the best but did not instil a sense of personal growth in them, and so now life isn't going as planned and it can't be their fault so it must be someone else's. 

They *hate* to see success in ethnic people who come here and earn it, and they *absolutely hate it* if their job means they end up interacting with this person.  It's almost as if it reminds them that their world model might not be true.  Anecdotally, if I'm at LHR in the immigration queue I will avoid going up to a counter manned by an Indian because I _know_ I'll get a hard time.  If I'm at a restaurant I _know_ I'll get a snotty service from a (British) Indian waiter.

I'm generalising.  There are lot of people out there who are very decent.  But, in my experience, I've had too many of these sorts of interactions for this to be a coincidence.  It could also just be me.

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Check out /r/LabourUK!,null,"&gt;Bullshit. Are you seriously saying that the financial crisis increased poor people’s ability to pay their bills? 

Obviously I am not saying that. I have made a point of repeatedly referring to material circumstances saying the same.

&gt;it’s just a measure of your wealth in comparison to others.

Would it help if we called 'relative poverty' something else? For the last time, and this really is the last time:

&gt;*Your relative income affects your life chances in a myriad ways* **regardless of your material circumstances.**

This is a statement of fact. It's not about paying bills. It's not about whether you have an Xbox. It's about relative differences in income. That's why we call it 'relative' poverty. Because it's relative. We measure it because we recognise this fact. Not measuring or recogising this fact will not cause this fact to go away. When Cameron does his stupid, eivl thing, children whose parents have an income that is lower than 60% of the median will still suffer. From poverty. Which is what that is called.

&gt;You could take a third world country and say that they don’t live in poverty because they’re all equally poor. 

You could not do that. Third world countries generally have higher levels of inequality than developed ones. You could apply the globally agreed measure of relative income and you would still find, even in a country where everyone was much, much poorer than everyone in Britain, that those under the 60% figure were worse off compared with their compatriots. That is why the measure is so useful: It applies in all kinds of situations.

What you are saying in the sentence I have quoted is 'But in this imaginary circumstance that I have imagined, the measurement clearly doesn't apply'. This is correct. It does, however, apply in the real world, which includes the UK, which is what we are discussing. If you did find an example of imaginary equal poverty land, then we could obviously also apply some other measures, which also exist. Y'know, all those other measures we keep talking about, and that everyone agrees we should use *alongside* relative poverty measurements to judge poverty levels.

&gt;Poverty should be a measure of the hardship you face in your life.

Poverty is not a measure of hardship. It is a measure of wealth. If you redefine poverty to mean something else, then, once again, you are suddenly right. But it doesn't mean what you want it to mean. It means what it actually means.

If we accept your definition, that poverty 'should' (why? How? According to whom?) mean 'hardship', then that would mean that if a millionnaire had a really hard life, they would be living in poverty. Please see that this is absurd and stop inventing spurious definitions of poverty.

Speaking of comparisons with millionnaires:

&gt;If it’s just a relative measure of wealth then we could say that a millionaire lives in relative poverty in comparison to a billionaire.

We could not say this. Who is saying this? Why do you think we could say this? Only you are saying this. Please stop staying this.",null,0,null,1435937860,null,0,false,0,csr2hot,null,t3_3bvyxk,null,t1_csr2hot,null,t1_csr1q23,null,null,null,1437554821,null,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1,null

null,false,boardsandbikes,null,null,null,"I think it will be an interesting year for him, and how he reacts to it will tell us a lot.

Firstly, he won't be first choice. Milner and Henderson will be our first choice central midfielders; Milner because it was part of the lure of coming to Anfield, and Henderson because he's developing so well you can't leave him out.

So that probably leaves one space in midfield open. I think the likely option will be Lucas playing defensive midfield when he's fit. I know people say that Rodgers doesn't like defensive midfielders, but Leon Britton was a constant in that position at Swansea, and Lucas has played first choice when he is fit. There's no agenda with Rodgers IMO, Lucas just hasn't been fit enough.

So if Lucas is first choice, does that mean Can is backup? Not necessarily. Physically he has the ability, and technically he could play the role, but it doesn't look so far like it's his natural position. I think he'll play as third choice central midfielder, probably starting in cups and europa league.

This is, to be honest, what would be expected of him at this stage in his career. It was only because of the rejigging of our system last year that he played as often as he did.

So that's why I think it'll be interesting; does he accept and understand the fact that his progression will be better suited playing less often in his preferred position, or does he become unhappy and unsettled because he's not playing as much? I think it will be a serious sign of what sort of player he'll be by what route his attitude takes.

Also, slightly off topic; why does nobody mention Allen playing at DM? He's tenacious, tackles well and often, can move the ball forward quickly; if he was told to literally sit and hold I think he could do the job very well as a backup to Lucas.",null,0,null,1435938133,null,0,false,0,csr2mnc,null,t3_3bw69a,null,t1_csr2mnc,null,t3_3bw69a,null,null,null,1437554937,null,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3,null

Yes and no. Had a very tough first two years because of various factors, but it got better after that.

Good: Find it easier to get work here. Like the national newpaper variety. Good transport. Eggs and bread are *good*. I can afford to go the dentist. 

Bad: Bureaucracy is annoying at times. Also, seems like you have to pay a special rate to call anyone and everyone -- even the tax office or to pay utilities.

Depends what you mean by ""Indian"". A lot of that comes from the fact that people were denied the ability to claim their Britishness during their parent's generation and now they're claiming it. Because because you get treated like crap for most of your life makes you defensive, and that probably one of the defence mechanisms.

They do that to me too, considering I'm born here it pisses me right off. It's almost if they have to prove they don't have a fraternity with you. I think also  with British Muslims in those positions you feel the pressure that people need to over perform. 

&gt;My personal opinion is that a lot of these people had parents who worked to the ground to give them the best but did not instil a sense of personal growth in them, and so now life isn't going as planned and it can't be their fault so it must be someone else's. 

Actually it's the fact that your parents worked their arsed off, and gave you everything and still you don't get the equality/ respect , so what's the point? I don't agree with it but I can understand it considering the amount of rubbish I've seen people go through. I have a mate who's Oxbridge, public school, very competent and he was told (without irony) that a position he was considering for fitted a more ""Urbane profile"", which was scandalous.  So you see examples of it. Also, because your parents were immigrants there was a shred of an excuse why they couldn't really integrate, but when you try your best , it doesn't work.  In places like Bethnal Green , the North of the UK there a bigger problems in terms of socio-economic depravation and integration which has its issues as well.

We complied with all 4 parts, so 1, 2, and 3 have been lifted for this upcoming season. The only part of our old settlement that still applies is the break-even targets. 

From UEFA's release: ""The UEFA CFCB has **lifted a number of restrictions on transfer activity, employee expenses and number of players** in UEFA club competitions imposed on Manchester City FC after the club reached certain targets towards break-even compliance as part of the ongoing monitoring of their settlement agreement. The lifting of restrictions is subject to ongoing additional controls and audits. The club remains under strict monitoring and has **still to meet break-even targets and is therefore subject to some limitations in 2016**""

IIRC, the break-even target for this season under the current settlement was that our 7m loss be cut in half. So its a difference of 3.5m. Our revenues are at all time highs because of the TV money, so that break-even provision isn't really a factor. We were already expecting to post a profit, and you'd have to figure that estimate factored in substantial spending this summer. 

Is it corrupt and unfair that new violators get to have an accelerated investment period with losses (look at Inter and AC Milan), essentially fundamentally different break-even provisions, that we didn't and still dont have?

&gt; Former firearms officer Anthony Long had told jury he acted in self defence when he shot 24-year-old **without warning**

&gt; Long shot dead 24-year-old Rodney without warning when he was a passenger in a car that police were following. Long said he believed its three occupants were planning a serious armed crime.

&gt; Rodney was the third person Long shot dead during his firearms career. He shot and killed two other people in the late 1980s and wounded two others. 

&gt; The jury of seven women and five men were not told this, because it would have prejudiced the case. Nor were they told that the prosecution had come after a previous official inquiry that did not accept Long’s account and found he &gt; had unlawfully killed Rodney.

&gt; The verdict means **no police firearms officer has ever been convicted of murder** for killing a suspect

&gt; No automatic weapons were found

&gt; Forensic and ballistic tests suggest five bullets hit Rodney as he was falling down, appearing to contradict the marksman’s account that he continued to fire because the suspect remained upright and posed a threat.

&gt; A deactivated weapon found on the back seat where Rodney was sitting had not been picked up by him. Two weapons were recovered from the vehicle’s rear footwell, as was a gun disguised as a key fob.

This is what made us play better when we changed to a back three. In the Chelsea game's case, Gerrard was simply doing the routine, drop in the middle of Sakho and Skrtel, get the ball and distribute, as he had done the whole season(I'm sure you didn't complain about this when we were winning games). Shit happens, he slipped and Chelsea scored. To say this is Rodgers' fault for trusting Steven Gerrard by allowing him to be the deepest person on the field is just dumb.

Yes it would - we should call it relative wealth, or economic equality because at the moment it's misleading and insulting to people who live in real poverty.

However, stating that they're paying an average marginal rate of 60% - while true - is a bit misleading given that they're still only paying an effective rate of 29-35%.

It's an odd quirk of the system; but simply removing it would be giving a tax cut to everyone earning over £100k - which wouldn't sound good in the current climate (although I'm a bit surprised the Conservatives haven't done it anyway - maybe they'll announce it in the next budget?).

Personally I'd be all for scrapping the band and allowance system altogether, and having a non-linear, increasing, but everywhere-differentiable actual income tax rate, probably tending to 100% as income tends to infinity.

Find out what you need to do to achieve the grade you're aiming for, this is usually in your course handbook.

Research everything. Jot down subjects or theories that your lecturers refer to or even just skim over, it will open you up to a much broader understanding.

Treat your degree like a full time job.
Work at it for 8-9 hours a day, do overtime if necessary. 
Take 'tea breaks' every few hours and go for a walk for an hour for your 'lunch break,' taking a notebook with you. This will clear your head a bit and you can note down anything that comes to you while you're out so you can look into later when you're back to work.

Save your weekends for parties and drinking and try to be in the habit of getting around 8 hours sleep on week nights.

This will save you from the inevitable tired switching off that happens when you're not fully there in your lectures. On that note, so will a good diet.

null,false,juzashannon,lfc12,,null,"Emre Can joined Liverpool this season with very little expectation for the start of his spell, but high expectations for the future of the club. A £10m signing was seen as a fantastic deal for him with his potential and the fact that Bayern Munich where also interested in re-signing him.

In the first half of the season, Emre Can was given a few chances but very rarely from the start of a match (Only starting 5 of Liverpool's games in 2014) and in his games at CM he wasn't impressive but apart some good moments like his goal vs Chelsea and a decent performance at the Bernabeu, nothing really stood out from the German Under 21 international.

However in the second half of the season, Emre began to impress the Anfield faithful when the three at the back was introduced with Emre being a component of it. With his ability to break forward as well as solid defending made him seem perfect for the role, this gets shown as unlike his only 5 starts in the first half of the season, he starts every game in the second half of the season except for the games vs Bolton and Blackburn (And he only missed the Blackburn game due to suspension)

Whilst he thrived in his CB role, at the very end of the season, Emre was tested in the Right Back role where it had to be described as a failure where he was constantly beaten and was considered the worst player on the pitch in the unforgettable 6-1 loss to Stoke.

The sky is the limit for Emre Can, with the versatility he has shown in the central areas of the pitch and being only 21 is nothing short of impressive and it could easily be imagined that he could be a vital part of the Liverpool midfield in the years to come with him most likely being a centre midfielder with the ability to attack and defend when needed.

Overall, I believe that Emre's first season has to be considered a success for the club and hopefully there will be more to come from the German.

TL/DR: Was a great deal to get him in, didn't do much in the first half the season, did much more in the second half of the season, wasn't impressive in CM, impressive versatility in CB, dreadful RB, sky is the limit.",null,0,null,1435940438,null,0,false,0,csr3t9w,null,t3_3bzzdv,null,t1_csr3t9w,null,t3_3bzzdv,null,null,null,1440502160,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

It didn't go to his head, he literally just stopped giving a shit about football.

I think Mario is like this. He loved the game growing up because he was so good at it. It was easy to him. Then he got huge money, all the trimmings and he's very, very bored with football now.

He just doesn't care.

He tries to force himself because of the love he once had for the game, but there's no drive, there's no determination to be the best in the world, that may have been there when he was a kid.

I think it's another what might have been.

I reckon a year or two away from football and he might, doubtful, but might come back because he found his hunger again.

The worst of the lot tend to be in case of Hajduk, the local kids, who claim how they've been Hajduk fans their whole lives. They tend to turn their backs and flee at first fistful of dollars someone shows them. Yeah thank you for investing in me, however I won't sign a contract with you those guys from France are offering me a deal as well, so long and thanks for all the fish.

They show less loyalty to the club they claim to love then the kids who came at the age of like 16 from Bosnia or whatever. Mario Pasalic was different.

He first stood out when he got a bid from Catania. IIRC Catania was offering a fair bit of money for a then 18 year old kid who never even played proper senior football, something like a mil euro (or was it mil and a half?). Doesn't matter. Hajduk being in dire financial situation of course accepted the deal and while everyone was celebrating how they made good money, Pasalic rejected the deal saying I don't want to play for Catania I want to play for Hajduk.

Us fans were over the moon of course, but the parasitic leeches around the clubs that tend to label themselves as ""journalists"" went on a spree where they attacked the kid, writing bullshit about how he destroyed Hajduk, how Hajduk needed that money, that if he loved Hajduk he should have went to Catania. How did Mario respond? He scored two against Dinamo on Poljud for the win.

And while he of course always had ups and downs in Hajduk (with there being far more ups then downs mind you), he always played his heart out. He didn't become a big headed primadona after five good games (unlike a certain blue gnome who plays of Barcelona B that was talk of the town at the same time), and when Chelsea agreed in February to sign him in the summer, he didn't start calculating, saving himself for Chelsea.

As mentioned the only one that is really important is ""Night of the Doctor"" which you should watch after the season 7 finale, ""Name of the Doctor"" before the 50th anniversary special, ""Day of the Doctor."" Also after, ""Day of the Doctor"" I recommend watching ""The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot"" which is hilarious for making fun of things in the show and behind the scenes and ""An Adventure in Space and Time"" which is a docudrama about the start of the show.

It's impossible to determine if substances are psychoactive without having someone experience it. Since the ban is based on that property it's next to impossible to verify if a substance is an NSP. Chemical structure and in vitro testing is not conclusive and would be time consuming and expensive.

That brings me back to your point - testing drugs will become more time consuming and expensive if all suspected NSPs need to be verified for trial. Even if we had a test system for NSPs, this would likely lead to a decrease in the police making charges as they will want to be very certain before wasting the effort.

Whilst testing for drugs like cocaine is straightforward, if the police are forced to test for a whole range of drugs it makes it a lot harder, and if suspects say they are non-psychoactives, the police may not pursue charges.

This is a potentially major issue with white listing, rather than black listing of substances.

Maybe they'll have preliminary testing for drugs of interest, then pass non-conclusive results on. Either way, it looks like it will cause a lot of hassle for the police and people may take advantage of that.

That's just conjecture, but stems from discussion by Lord Norton (I think, the former police chief).",null,0,null,1435940996,null,0,false,0,csr43yr,null,t3_3bznpl,null,t1_csr43yr,null,t1_csr0442,null,null,null,1437556185,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Anecdote time to make you cry and laugh:

I worked for a car company a while back, American outfit, fairly new on the scene. We had a young lady working with us who put her car in to a garage local to her for a small job. When she went back to them, they told her they were legally obliged to hold onto the keys and couldn't release the car to her unless she got the work done that they said was needed, over a grand's worth.

Of course, she knew it was bullshit, but didn't know what to do. She was in tears about it, properly distraught as she lived a good distance away and had commitments she needed her car for.

They hadn't figured out where she worked. You see, in this car company I mentioned, we had the best service engineers from the world's leading luxury and performance car manufacturers. (They couldn't do the work for her - it's not as if they had the time as these guys were working flat out, 24/7 on customer jobs, often overseas).

The head of European Service Engineering happened to sit near her in the office, and he was a former Service Engineering Manager from an outfit that did all the service engineering for a certain Italian car company. Needless to say, not only did he see it for the scam it was, but he also happened to be one of the most connected engineers in the UK, if not the world. Lovely bloke he is, too.

So he rings up this garage, tells them who he is, tells them he's contacting the police, gives the names of a couple of coppers who specialise in auto crime, quotes the crime they're performing, also says he's ringing round every car manufacturer, parts suppliers, all the local car dealerships, will letting them know what's going on and that they'll not only be blacklisted, but also none of them will ever work in the auto trade ever again. He tells them what the work was that needed doing and that he's calling back in a couple of hours to check it's been done and the keys are in her hand or else he's pulling the trigger and sending them all back to school for a Level 1 NVQ in plumming and joinery with a criminal record.

The main goal of moving of course was that I would gain a British education which is fair to say is held in a higher regard then even many of the private schooling systems in South Africa. Also gaining qualifications such as GCSE and A-Levels here held me in better standing for access to UK Universities and by the time that came around I had gained citizenship and thus the ability to pay UK student fees. The foreign fees can be quite hefty. 

In terms of living here the weather can obviously be considered a big thing but I've come to enjoy the cold, particularly with now living in Scotland (love the Cairngorms!). Hillwalking and the natural environment are now my favourite pastimes to explore whenever I can rope a friend into coming along, I really dislike going alone. 

Sport used to be a big part of my identity, watching the Springboks and Sharks play of course, but I came to lose my touch with rugby outside of national games and have never really got into football. I remember going to a football game after a few months in the UK with some new friends and having my first real encounter with the drinking culture and the chav-ish types, that was eye-opening I didn't really have anything relateable to that before due to the social differences in SA. 

I'm still studying and I've come across no major setbacks thus far in society, I love how safe everything is here and I still remark to friends at how little crime there is say at a night out where folks are stumbling back in the wee hours with little worry for themselves. 

Something I keenly remember was how vulnerable I used to feel in SA and the steps we used to take to ensure our security, no walking at night or alone and so on. My friends here still raise an eyebrow when I lock everything up just to go put the rubbish in the bin down the street and laugh at my general security consciousness. 

Something I think the UK does very well is providing opportunities from a fantastic education system to the NHS and welfare, things other nations really wish they could provide for their citizens as well as a very considerate police force and friendly armed forces. I've always taken to visiting a local airshow when one has been on and been to many of the military museums and memorials. 

For the bad, I guess I would consider the rent to be quite high but at the same time I find my weekly shopping for fresh goods to be quite reasonable. The culture I find can be a bit cold, especially when visiting London or the big cities I found people to very much stick to their own or just glaze over others as if they don't exist. 

Making friends outside of work, uni or a devoted club can be quite hard. But at the same time once you break that initial frigidness with a group or individuals and you confirm that you aren't some crazy just wandering about I find they open up and accept you. I've only had one violent encounter if it can be called that after a night out from a local Ned who decided to jockle a friend and myself and state that ""South Africans aren't hard mate"". I've still got his Ned-y hat on my shelf. 

Since I've managed to gain dual-citizenship I intend to stay here for now, although I may consider going back to SA if I found the economic and social situation there to improve as the lifestyle and environment there is really quite good. I find British people, particularly here, to be quite harsh on the UK and take on a general doomsayer type attitude to the future and really put down the accomplishments this great nation has made. 

I still think the UK has a bright future and I consider it a privilege to be here and take a fair bit of pride in my UK citizenship. ",null,0,null,1435941403,null,0,false,0,csr4bjf,null,t3_3bzgyk,null,t1_csr4bjf,null,t3_3bzgyk,null,null,null,1437556374,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

null,false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,Labour | Check out /r/LabourUK!,null,"&gt;I think that when the government talk about taking people out of poverty most people in the UK think of how many people can pay their bills and feed their children

Many people earning less than [the figure I'm sick of typing] cannot do those things, or struggle to do those things.

Also, you're wrong about what 'most people in the UK think' (which isn't surpising given that you're so arrogant that you think that you're a) smarter than the OECD and b) able to speak authoritatively for 'most people in the UK'): The Joseph Rowntree Foundation conducts annual studies which are designed to reach a consensus definition of poverty. The most recent one found that 'most people in the UK' agree that one's parents being unable to afford 'one £50 birthday present' for you is among the definitions of a child living in poverty. Payment of bills did not, I believe, get a mention.

This is a train of thought about relative poverty that goes back at least as far as Adam Smith, who argued that poverty was the inability to afford 'not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to be without'. [He's not alone in this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty#Relative_poverty).

Even if the above weren't true, and you were right with your off-the-top-of-your-head appeal to 'most people in the UK', why would they, not the experts at the OECD be right? Turns out that most people in the UK *agree* that poverty is not merely 'not being able to pay the bills'.

&gt;we should call it relative wealth, or economic equality because at the moment it's misleading and insulting to people who live in real poverty

I think it's insulting to find someone whose entire problem is that they don't have enough money and then tell them that their poverty isn't 'real', but I also think the argument about what is or isn't 'insulting' according to two randoms on Reddit is completely irrelevant to the very real affects of relative poverty, which are real, demonstrable and backed up by decades of data.

&gt;British man earning minimum wage to ethiopian ""Hey, living in poverty? Yeah, me too. Sucks, doesn't it?"".

So, if Alice has a cold, does the fact that Bob has cancer mean she's not sick?

The UN agrees that relative poverty is the 'most useful measure for ascertaining poverty rates in wealthy developed nations'. *Wealthy developed nations*. The UN says poverty exists in those nations, and that it is sensible to measure it. Geez, wonder who I should agree with: The UN or some dude on Reddit?

I don't know how you can bring this into line with the definition of the IRA as terrorists, but I suppose the IRA were terrorists because in many ways they were seen as wanting the destruction of Britain, although I suppose their main objectives were just irish reunification, which in a way would've destroyed 'Britain' as it was defined at that time. White people have been called terrorists and for a long time in the UK the only terrorists were white. Separatists are also called terrorists, or have been on many occasions. Isn't part of the basque movement often called a terrorist organisation? I see a lot of people in my news feed on fb calling people who shot people dead at high schools or whatever 'terrorists', but a lot of those people had no political motives at all.

Costa, who swapped the Calderon for Stamford Bridge last summer, would be delighted if his old team-mate followed in his footsteps this summer.

When asked about Turan, he told Turkish publication Bugun: ""It would be fantastic. Arda makes everything so much easier out on the pitch. Arda, Filipe and I function perfectly. And Arda is such a great person.

Same with Willian, he stays back to cover brana's runs a lot of times and runs all over the pitch to win the ball back/track a man, etc.. so yeah he wouldn't start at those teams because his role doesn't fit with that team. 

That being said, im not saying Willian is perfect and can't be upgraded. Even though he is improved a *ton* in the second half of the season especially near the end when he was putting in MOTM performances, he still had moments where he was too afraid to beat his man, did the same same move every time, held the ball up too long, etc..

Find players who are better than the ones we have now in the next window. Other than that i hope we get a striker, DM/CM and reserve LB.

And fewer goals than our ostensibly shit football produced. We also juggled a European competition and a lengthy cup run and played more matches than almost every team in the league. They lost mediocre players and kept their best player, who they will now lose in this window. 

Southampton are by a distance the most overrated team on reddit. Probably the only team who have managed to convince people they are as good as or better than teams they lose to and finish below. It's hilarious...you've got people on /r/soccer calling it a ""sideways move"" to go from Southampton to LFC or Spurs. It's lunacy. 

If we offer him more money--and we probably will if we agree a fee with Atletico--we will get him. If he ends up at Southampton it will be because we aren't as interested as the media are convinced, and that wouldn't surprise me at all given how hard it's going to be to move some of these center backs. 

Now back to Everton going off the boil completely. I think it's pretty clear that a big contributing factor in their garbage season was Europa League. For all the shit that Spurs get, we have proven that we are a team that can juggle a European competition while also not underachieving in the Premier League. Really only the top four + us have proven this regularly...LFC are a bit sketchy in this regard still. 

Everton qualified and went from 5th to 11th. A few years ago Newcastle qualified and went from 5th to 16th. Swansea went from 9th to 12th and then back up into the top 10 with no Europa. 

All these darlings that /r/soccer is convinced will be above Spurs and LFC in the near future have failed miserably when it comes to participating in a European competition while not suffering for it in the league. I think there's a pretty good chance Southampton suffers the same fate this season if they get through their qualifiers. 

The fact is, Spurs and LFC are sort of in their own tier right now. There is daylight between us and the teams above us, but there's a lot more of it between us and the teams below us. We are closer to competing for the top four than we are to being regularly usurped by clubs like Southampton. West Ham are the interesting one because they are going to probably have a lot more revenue coming in 16/17 and they are spending money. They have the right balance of ambition and wealth.

From the little i knew about him previously i was excited to see him play and i think he lived up to, if not exceeded expectations. He is confident with the ball at his feet, plays good passes both short and long, and he's pretty quick for a big guy. He played well as a 3rd CB although you could tell at times that it wasn't his preferred position. He was however exposed when played at RB, he doesn't have the pace/stamina to be shuttling up and down the wing for 90 mins.  
His position in the squad this season very much depends on the formation that Rodgers decides to play. If he was to play in midfield with Hendo and Milner in a 433 I see him starting a lot of games, the work of the other two would make up for his drifting out of position. In a 4231 I would see him as more of a rotation player.  
If he realises his potential, which i think he will, i see him being one of the first names on the team sheet in three years time. The things that he is lacking are the things that are picked up with experience, positioning and decision making.  
I see him being a deep lying midfielder who marauds forward, similar to a Schweinsteiger. Someone who starts off a run of play, but you wouldn't be surprised to see popping up on the edge of the box.

null,false,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,null,"Copy and paste of my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/3bmdys/best_place_for_news_regarding_the_show/csnhyg3) from /r/Gallifrey:

&gt; Where do *I* go? Because I generally report news (albeit, not lately), I go to so many places (and feel relying upon a single place is rather silly). The word ""redundancy"" has nothing on me; I often see the same news piece upwards of 10 times. I don't actually expect anyone to actually do this, but I thought I'd share anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; This is generally split into **4 main aggregators** (where multiple sources are combined into one).
&gt; 
&gt; To get the most obvious out of the way, **Reddit**. This site has some crazy fast submissions. Because I'm a mod and I've decided to see everything, anything that comes up I'll see (be it immediate desktop notifications from toolbox or eventually in the regular content, i.e. submissions/comments, emails I coded for myself). People who wish to have notifications can easily do a similar thing with the RSS feeds that are literally everywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, there's **Twitter**. This is generally best for the smaller and/or immediate things when you're online and following a small subset. Best examples would be the official accounts (BBCDoctorWho, BBCAmerica, BBCWPress, etc) and the #DWSR tag. This is generally very hard to keep up and is only really good in some cases.
&gt; 
&gt; The final two are the main ones. Thirdly, there's **Feedly**, an online RSS reader. Any news site I see that provides relevant content I generally add here. Combine this with notifications and I'll know about things within a minute or so of them being originally posted. Anything I've already read or not interested in will simply be marked as such. It also works excellently with my Android phone since there's a widget for it!
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, we have **Google**. People may not realise it, but Google have a pretty decent news page with relatively alright duplicate article checking. There's so many ways you can do this. You can simply check the page every now and then. You can get regular round-up emails. Personally, like the rest, I've gone to the other end of the spectrum. I've got it set to email me everything as it happens. This, of course, results in a lot of emails (usually 3-15 per day), a lot of which contain things that match the keywords but not the topic.
&gt; 
&gt; Like I said, I don't expect anyone sane to actually do this, but there's some ideas there.

I knew I should have bought rice futures...

 It may well have been necessary to do QE and I actually think QE was a good way of getting rid of bad debt (but they should have given some to  poorest and average incomes so they could have paid off their debt) and lets face it pumping money/liquidity into the economy is bound to benefit everybody marginally but it benefited the rich vastly more than the poor. Also did they even look at the benefits of QE being used straight into the real economy? If they didn't even take it into account they cant make a judgement of the opportunity cost of doing QE compared with QE for the real economy.  Basically my argument is the same as Mark Blyth's that QE was necessary at the beginning of the financial crisis but now QE for the people is necessary, and I also question the logic of all the QE going to the financial sector and not having a split and looking at whether using some of the QE to go to the real economy would have had a better outcome. But QE for the people is very unlikely because banks would not like it and politicians want to keep banks onside, politicians can just fob-off the people.

As for the currency issue, I would be buying it through a UK estate agent most likely, with a mortgage in a British bank. I feel that this is the best way to avoid a) Cypriot economic instability, and b) the exchange rate problem.

I'd have to look into the tax issue, and of course I will if I end up going down this route (or preferably hiring someone more qualified to look into it for me). I know that in Cyprus it's essential to have the title deed to the house otherwise it's impossible to prove ownership.

I accept that with the deductions for organising an agent to sort out maintenance and things like that (there are property agencies in Cyprus designed for exactly this kind of thing) I am still looking at making a loss - but my idea was to pay less than I would on a mortgage in the UK, which I still think I can achieve.

Jobs; there aren't any really unless you're really skilled. I have zero problem getting a job. I can walk out of this today and walk into a new one on Tuesday. But only in London, where I'm fucked anyway. 

I'm getting a raw deal too; we got child tax credit but I have to give half of it back now off my tax code the following year. Now they're taking it in advance as well and that results in a £190 drop every month in income plus a tax return and all the associated pain.

As for Edmonton, I wouldn't live there as I have three children, hence the £1950 a month which gets me a shithole in a nicer area these days. I'm paying all that for a school that isn't rated ""requires improvement"". I was paying £950 a month but the landlord sold up and I had to take the first thing that came along for a premium. I don't have the luxury of taking a non-private rent. Now I'm stuck with it because I can't afford to move.

So I think we're all equally in the shit.

I think can performed adequately in the positions he was placed in. part of his value when we purchased was his versatility, so he proved his worth to BR and did so without a grudge. he got valuable premier experience and has more experience with the speed of play here and the physicality. I think for everyone who complains that he won't transition back into midfield easily because of his positional versatility is stupid, any experience is good experience. Stevie, if you remember, started as a right back. 

Emre got around 40 appearances this season, that's incredible for his age. he is definitely going to come on strong next season. he also gives us formational flexibility. by having can able to play in a back 3, we are more unpredictable. sahko, skrtel can was about as solid as it got for us, and with moreno more experienced and clyne coming in, that formation suits us a lot better. 

I think he exceeded expectations, people probably thought he wasn't going to play very much and he came in as a realtively unknown quanity. i saw the ""he's a bayern reject"" brandied around by some, but for me personally, i hadn't a clue of who he was. and boy was i surprised. very glad we purchased him, he'll be a big player for lfc next season and a big player for germany within the next year or 2 whenever sweini and lahm bow out. 

i personally think he will be competing with lucas at the base of the midfield, wheather a diamond, a midfield 3. but those are the two main formations i see us playing. on top of that, i think he'll get some games to be the ball playing center back in a back 3 in some matches. 

in 3 years, i fully expect him to be a full regular for us and germany and we will have teams looking to buy him for 20-40m. he has that much potential.

- As the dividend was a return on investment, when the dividend dropped the *value to the fund* of the shares fell.

- when the pension fund of a company falls in value below that required it is deficit which has to made good by the company

- a company with a pension deficit has to shore that up, so can't pay dividends at same level

null,false,kiddinlikecudi,null,null,null,"I want to talk about Falcao for a second because of the intense amount of negativity surrounding him. I think it's a bit unjust so here goes.

First off, I get it. I have followed him all last year and watched United games hoping I could get to see him play, and ultimately, he was underwhelming there. To address these concerns, I point at the system Van Gaal introduced last year. If you look at Falcao's record before United, he was at Porto, Atletico, then Monaco. He was considered successful at each club because their style was not to keep possession but counter attacking and getting to the goal. Our style changes based on the opponent, so I have confidence Mourinho can help him fit to his plans.

Second, his ACL tear. This injury is such a son of a bitch. Never personally experienced it but seeing professionals and amateurs trying to recover is so difficult but the fact of the matter is that it can be done. I can't think of too many real world examples off the top of my head but Adrian Peterson comes to mind from the NFL. Torres obviously comes to everyone's mind but I want to be as optimistic with Falcao as possible. 

Finally, I feel like his introduction to our team is being compared too closely to Torres'. The situations they come into is so different. Torres was meant to be someone coming into the team and challenging for the starting  position. Falcao comes in with the knowledge that Costa is our go-to striker. Also, the deal Falcao comes on is for one year. Falcao realizes he has to come in and perform at a high level to continue his dream of the EPL. Torres never came in with those thoughts, though he should have. 

Anyway, just be open minded about Falcao guys because while this deal comes with the knowledge he will fail, he does have the ability to score and in loads. 

TL;DR: United system sucks, ACL tear is bad but recoverable, and Torres=\=Falcao",null,0,null,1435947001,null,0,false,0,csr7blt,null,t3_3bysfc,null,t1_csr7blt,null,t3_3bysfc,null,null,null,1437558627,null,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2,null

**George Evans**
 
Evans has been with the City youth system since he was knee high to a grasshopper, and operates as a proper English central midfielder, and I don’t mean that as a piss-take either.  The lad plays with just a touch of that Lampard/Gerrard/Scholes-esque vision that set them apart from their contemporaries.  Evans was included in PEllegrini’s squad selection for the mid- and post-season friendlies where he put his range and vision firmly in display.  Against Hamburg he hit a magical long pass within 5 minutes of his introduction to put it on a proverbial plate for Jovetic’s opener, and again in Toronto Evans arrived as a substitute and scored a stunning goal from 25 yards out from absolutely nothing.  His half-season loan to Crewe Alexandra was generally successful typified again by occasional moments of glorious vision but he will need more consistency before he can think about making an impact on the Premier League.

**Future**

EVANS: Despite impressing with limited senior minutes he needs to do more than he did with Crewe.  There’s a big gulf between reasonably good performances in League One and what is required to challenge for the Premier League, but time is still on Evan’s side and a loan to a higher level team will show whether Evans can deliver consistently or if the moments of brilliance are too few and far between.

Was terribly excited to come here - I'd been on hols to London and Brighton in the mid-nineties, thought it was the shit (like probably a lot of Europeans at the time). I expected everybody to be Stephen Fry and Julian Barnes. Finally made the leap when I was 26. Moved to Brighton as an au pair and was aghast at how much it had changed - no more quiet seaside town. London, too, felt overcrowded and stressed out. Everyone and their dog obsessed with mortgages, making money, saving money, spending money on fancy stuff. Something happened in those ten years, I suppose we could call it New Labour. It's painful to see how Britain is dismantling itself - selling out and selling off assets that ought to belong to the people, becoming the 51st US state with an ever-widening social gap... Sorry, enough of the commie talk.

Felt like I couldn't really get close to folks, although fair enough, I was doubly the outsider and had had a close-knit peer group back home. Britons more reserved in general. Was and still am both impressed by high levels of organisation - probably a remnant of an efficiently run empire (try getting shit done in 5 working days in Austria), by the tidy, categorizing attitude.. although there are situation when it grates. There's less spontaneity. Some backwards attitudes, a distinct lack of social mobility. I still don't know if I'm working or middle class. I dislike that people even think in those terms. On the other hand, Britons on the whole are wonderfully polite, civilized and tolerant people. Austrians are fucking rude cunts and hate anyone who's different. Institutional racism is rife there and contrary to Britain there's no proper appeals processes, no holding to account, no external nor internal ethics. (Not saying it's perfect here but a great deal better - it is something of a tradition and a code of honour). Britons are also super-helpful and generous, I love the way charity has been implemented in the psyche and daily life (although again, it feels like it's taken a slightly wrong turn and is now increasingly fulfilling what should be the remit of state organisations - I love that the charitable inclination and reflexes are there, but they should only ever be an add-on or a beneficial hobby).

I moved to Scotland fairly quickly, and it's been my home for over ten years. Love it. It's almost like a continuation of the Social-Democratic way of life we had in the 80ies in Austria - as in other European countries, Labour went to shit there, too, but at least there's a viable alternative here and in fact they're governing the country. Glasgow's in a league of its own - rough and friendly, hands-on and relaxed at the same time. Really interesting brew and quite different from my hometowns (Vienna and Budapest).

I bought very few textbooks, but I did go to all the lectures, do the best possible job I could on the coursework, and revise for exams. To be honest, though, there was a lot less rote learning for the exams than at GCSE or A-Level.

Basically all the things you'd do for good grades at school. Show up to classes, do your homework, and revise for exams. Was easier than A-Levels IMHO.

I think, and I'm as guilty of this as anyone, we have hyped him so much that it can at times blind us to some of the weaker points to his game.

I think he surprised us, and we probably surprised him, with how many games he played last year. Albeit not in his correct position, but in every position he played expect RB he impressed in one way or another.

I tend to agree with most of the sub in that his best position at the moment is a Toure-like box to box midfielder. He doesn't at the moment have the positional discipline to play as our holding midfielder.

BUT I think if he wanted to be, he could be a top-class defensive midfielder. He has all the attributes physically and technically to be a fantastic player, but he has to learn the position, and more importantly he has to want to play the position. Does he actually want to play there, or does he want to have more of an influence going forward? He's young enough that he could choose to go either way.

If it was someone who did a few 35s in 30 zones, nipped through a red light just as it changed and before any other directions went green, and no harm was done, then fine, mechanism for preventing license loss where driving is essential might be a good idea. But that should be for borderline cases, for situations where it is reasonable to interpret offenses as mistakes, lapses in concentration, non-deliberate acts.

I don't think it would be bad for you to work for a year or two before trying university again. Typically working a job can help you get into the mindset of working hard. 

Your school results will never go away and never become ""invalid"", however they will lose importance. Typically when trumped by something more important, say a degree or useful experience.

Quality of the league reduced, losing a team capible ot matching Celtic pound for pound with purchases meant player talent reduced.

Rangers have a massive following most of whom no longer have an interest in the top flight.

Viewership increased in the championship because 3 top flight teams were involved with players of quality above the standard of the championship this is easily noticable by the 3 top flight quality teams finishing 1-3. It was a more competitive league but never a better league. The championship (England) is the most competitve league in the world and yet its viewership is dwarfed by la liga, BPL, etc etc etc

Competitiveness does not = viewership, quality does. We see it in every facet of sport from running hussain bolt destroys his competition and yet interest in running exploded after he burst onto the stage. Humans want to see people what are the best at their respective field (quality) not mediocre but competitive. Tiger woods increased interest in golf (in his day) so on and so forth.

I've said it a couple times over the course of the year that I'm not as optimistic about his future as most of the fans, particularly on here, seemingly are. That's not to say I think he's poor or anything, but that I just don't see world class potential in him. 

I remember reading an interesting quote from Juup Heynckes when we bought Can last summer that goes along the lines of, ""He's a defender, he just doesn't know it yet."" That stuck out to me just b/c of Heynckes' pedigree &amp; how versatile Can was thought to be and when he started performing the way he did as a CB for us in the 3 at the back system, it kind of clicked.

But he's too dynamic to be kept at the back I think, he's your prototypical box to box player, really. Powerful, technical, physical, dynamic, everything you'd want. Only problem is we already have a ready made version of that in Hendo. 

Anyways, where I stand on him as of this season? He's not a starter,  at least in the beginning of the season, maybe he earns it but he has to earn it. Hendo is a starter, Milner is a starter and I take a fit Lucas over him too. The idea of a Hendo/Can/Milner trio in the center - a fluid, interchanging, dynamic midfield is intriguing to me but I'll take a fit Lucas for stability and park him behind the marauding pairing of Milner &amp; Hendo. 

Can should be rotated in and given time though, not at CB, not at LB, but at CM, box to box or DM. We need to see more of him there &amp; he needs to get used to that role in the EPL pace.

I think the rule of thumb - at least with my dad - is that anything under an 8 minute pace is good for running if you're in shape and want to run competitively. I might be wrong, however. A lot of things can affect your pace however, like the temperature, terrain (steeper runs will affect your time more than flat surfaces, of course), etc. But if you just want to run, you probably shouldn't really worry all that much about pacing yourself and just try to enjoy it and taking everything in. I was never good at pacing myself either, so it's easier than done in my case!

As far as your other sports are concerned, I commend you for at least wanting to do a variety of events. I wouldn't mind playing tennis but I wouldn't be bothered to buy rackets and stuff. Never liked climbing, and can't swim. So running and running-based sports were really the only thing I did growing up until I phased out of it.

I can't see how you can't connect the dots and see how the series of events unfolded. There are plenty of articles from plenty of websites all discussing Dr Taylor. I would link to some but I'm out and on mobile ATM.

With regards to feminist tweets all you have to do is look and you will find them. Self identified feminist declaring the outrage when nobody at ESA (male or female) had a problem with it. I feel sorry for Dr Taylor because I imagine he is far to busy to pay attention to cultural problems. A more informed person would see through the faux outrage. The fact that he broke down leads me to believe he generally thought he caused great offence.

When we moved here, I did not expect anything, just took it day bay day. It was quiet difficult not having any friends for the first 3-4 months. Mon - Fri I would just go to library and on weekends hope to come up with something to do. I really enjoy the British spirit: people walking by smiling, polite, friendly even to the unknown.
