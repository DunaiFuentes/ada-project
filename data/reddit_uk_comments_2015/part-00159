the prices of shares (and other financial products that you can buy in an S&amp;S ISA) move every second. they go up and down, and if you have a need for the money when they are down, then you will have less than you started with. this is a risk, but people accept it because they also have the opportunity to benefit from rising prices. there is no right or wrong, the key is understanding your personality and financial position and knowing whether taking on the risk to try and get the reward is appropriate.

null,false,Brotherbear561,SSP,,null,"Ed Miliband has now twice ruled out a second referendum on Scottish independence if he becomes Prime Minister, even if a party at next year’s Scottish elections is elected with a mandate for a referendum.

Yet, despite this anti-democratic outrage, not a squeak can be heard from Nicola Sturgeon in opposition. Indeed, the only noises Sturgeon has made about a referendum is to play the possibility of it down, so much so that it now seems unlikely that a second referendum will be in the SNP’s party manifesto for the 2016 Scottish elections.

She has said a “material” change in circumstances would be required to change her mind about putting it in the party’s manifesto. The only example of something “material” that she has given is a UK exit from the EU, something that would only happen: a) with a Tory Prime Minister, suggesting a Tory victory in itself would not be sufficient to trigger a “material” shift, and b) after the Scottish elections in 2016.

Sturgeon has confirmed that a referendum won’t be in the manifesto “as it stands”, and spoke directly to the SNP’s 100,000+ members in The Herald on Friday to dampen down expectations of #indyref2, saying: “My experience of the members, and I can’t claim to have spoken to all of them but I have spoken to a significant number, is they are a very pragmatic bunch, who understand the realities of politics.

“They also understand this democratic point: That Scotland will only be independent when a majority of people want Scotland to be independent.

“No matter how much we might want to rush that process the Scottish people will not allow it to be rushed.

“My experience of the new members and our existing members is that they understand that.”

One could argue, like unionists do, that this is just pre-General Election positioning, and once May 7 is out the way she will find an excuse to get it on to the ballot paper again. I think this is a mistaken view.

Sturgeon has a different strategy. She wants a slow accumulation of powers and power by the Scottish Parliament under SNP leadership, and to impose Scotland onto UK politics in such a way as it breeds confidence in Scotland’s ability to lead politically, thus moving no voters over to yes gradually.

That is a war of attrition strategy, and it’s one that works for the SNP – it limits the unionist attack line about the SNP being a single-issue party, and it allows the SNP to focus on being a government at Holyrood and an opposition at Westminster, a dual political identity which gives them hegemony in Scotland. Once enough power has been accrued, and once polls show 60+ per cent in favour of independence, then the party will strike with another referendum, maybe in ten or fifteen years.

But just because it works as a strategy for the SNP, doesn’t mean it is right for the people of Scotland.

First of all, who says we aren’t ready for another referendum? Polls show that 42 per cent of people in Scotland want another referendum before 2020, compared to 38 per cent who want a referendum at some point after 2020 and 20 per cent who never want another referendum. So the largest group is people who want another referendum within the next term of the Scottish Parliament.

The democratic arguments against a second referendum before 2020 don’t wash – it doesn’t matter a jot that Sturgeon said during the last referendum campaign that it would be Scotland’s only shot for a generation; what matters is what people want now. Sturgeon’s position, and that of the pro-union parties, doesn’t reflect the fact that Scotland is going through a political transformation like never before seen. A pro-independence party is, according to the latest polls, on 54 per cent, a result that would wipe out a party that has won every Westminster election in Scotland for over half a century. Everything that went before is now redundant – the idea referendums are once in a generation doesn’t match the democratic awakening of Scotland in 2015.

The politics of independence are now inseparable from the politics of transformation in Scotland. Sturgeon’s attempt to create a breach between the two in the General Election campaign is understandable as a vote winning strategy, but it doesn’t match the challenge that Scotland faces. We won’t end poverty and radically reduce inequality with an SNP-Labour deal – both party’s proposals over public spending are actually very conservative; a half per cent rise in public spending goes nowhere near rolling back the austerity of the past five years. The big increase in spending on the NHS that the SNP and Labour are committed to would mean cuts for some other departments within the restrictions of a half a per cent rise in spending. I wager that if a Miliband government relying on SNP support last the five years, poverty levels in 2020 will not be dissimilar to today.

That’s not the SNP’s fault per se – it’s a fault of the Westminster system and establishment that such modest proposals can be seen as radical. But it does mean that delaying the move towards independence means a delay in the really radical change that we need.

And that change has to be much more radical than the SNP’s white paper proposal before the 2014 referendum, which was barely sufficient when oil prices were over $100 a barrel. and id now just patently insufficient. Independence-lite, with our money still controlled by the Bank of England (and therefore the City of London), cannot rise to the financial challenge of low oil prices Scotland. The collapse in oil revenue means Scotland needs to be able to borrow substantially in the early years, and it needs to be able to have an entirely separate tax regime that can get the wealth and assets being wasted by the super-rich and use it for productive investment. That means Scotland needs its own currency and its own central bank, and to be able to implement capital controls, and that’s just for starters.

Is all of this too risky, politically and economically? Let’s not forget that the number of people reliant on Trussell Trust foodbanks has just ticked over the million mark, and if inequality continued to rise at the same rate as it is right now, by 2025 the top 10 per cent would have all of the UK’s wealth. The SNP might not need to take a risk, but the people do. If Sturgeon’s going to put party before people, we need another voice in the pro-independence movement to say we want a referendum as soon as we can get a mandate for one, and we want independence-max, not independence-lite, to end poverty in Scotland as quickly as possible and allow the people to flourish.",null,0,null,1430213023,null,0,false,0,cqr9zsl,null,t3_344wd0,null,t1_cqr9zsl,null,t3_344wd0,null,null,null,1432648477,null,1,false,scottishpolitics,t5_2u66o,1,null

Where's the evidence that children learn from their parents? Everywhere. Isn't it kind of strange to imagine that children can't learn relationship stuff by example, but can learn everything else? 

&gt; What about the fact that people aren't 1950s cliches anymore and all mothers and fathers aren't going to be stereotypically feminine or masculine?

Yeh this is a good point. We can also point to other cultures, and ask about the effects of different behaviours. Is there a common theme that goes along with womanly behaviour and manly behaviour? It depends on the culture, but generally even if a woman is less feminine, she's still typically more feminine than masculine, especially when it comes to biological things. That's probably why you find so many more lesbians having children than gay men. They're answering their instincts. So I think you have a good point, but I don't think it applies to most people.

I suppose it's because kids being with their primary care-giver is better than giving them away to some other couple. I mean, if there was evidence that showed that single parents failed super, super hard, perhaps people would be campaigning about the blight that those children have on society, and a far greater emphasis on relieving single parents from their woeful fates.

I disagree.

30% abstaining is very different to 30% spoiling. Please don't go with ""but that'll never happen"". That very line is why people fail to even bother to spoil.

Personally, I'd far prefer voting to be mandatory, and the polling cards to have a ""none of the above"" option. I'd be interested in seeing what the true number of spoiled votes are at that point.

For one, there is a difference between simply supporting one kind of immigration system, and promoting that immigration system by using completely backwards stereotypes about people from (for example) Eastern Europe, and blaming almost every problem in the UK on those immigrants. Supporting a certain kind of immigration system also doesn't justify, for example, being completely unscientific and rejecting man-made climate change, 

For two, there is a difference between having open borders with the rest of the world, and having open borders with a small number of countries with fairly similar economic standards to us, who we can claim back costs for their migrants from.

It doesn't lend itself to easy sound-bites but I will take your question as genuine and try my best to answer it as unlike many of the commentators here I have taken the time to listen to his latest book and find out what it is he's saying.

1) First he is saying that the way things are, are blatantly broken. 
Evidence 
A) Climate devastation, inability to act in urgency to this.
B) Unbelieveable wealth gap growing every day.

2) These problems are getting worse under governments of the left and right. There is no reason to believe that they will be addressed though our current political system.

3) Part of this is that capitalism is fucking us up and no party will address that as an issue. - This leads to one of the components of an answer to what is the alternative..

4) Part of that is a lack of what I can only call spiritual development. This doesn't have to be about believing in God but it is about personal introspection and the ability to transform our own shadow material into being of service to the wider community and our planet. We would all rather project what's wrong in the world to others. Whether its immigrants, people on benefits or yes the rich. Who Brand claims are also prisoners of a broken system (although I think he sometimes forgets how important a truth this is when he get's particularly upset). This is also strictly off the political menu and leads to the second component of a possible answer to the '*so what's the alternative?*' question.

5) Brand is not the Messiah he's a very naughty boy. Being able to articulate what many of us would agree with that a lack of individual spiritual practice and a subservient relationship to capital and markets is driving planet earth into a ditch is not a divine capacity to spell out exactly what needs to happen next. He has many ideas. Some will be good ones some will be less good. You may have as many useful suggestions to your answer as he has. This is the third component to your answer.

6) There must be better than this. This in a nutshell is the dogma according to Brand said in a nasally Essex exasperated banterish way.
""There must be better than this or we are fucking fucked. Of course there is better than this. Humans are incredible we can do all sorts of mad shit. We can create a better system to live in than the current one""  Although this might not seem like an answer. It actually is more of one than you might think. The sheer belief that we can do better than this is what has led humans out of all sorts of dark ages. 

7) So I have given you the context, which I think is absolutely necessary, but I think its fair to give you some meat. But before I do I think it's fair to say that although Brand wants a revolution as opposed to waiting the billion years we haven't got for our political system to deliver he does not want a violent revolution. Violent revolution is a declaration of violence over humour, violence over vulnerability, hierarchy over equality. Nothing that a funny dandy hippy from Essex who wants to be in a more feeling loving society would ever come from a violet revolution. So that leads to a belief in two stages to a peaceful revolution.

8) Stage 1 - At a high point of the swedish social democratic 'revolution' there were concrete plans for put 20% of all corporate profits into regional boards owned by the workforce who could choose what they wanted to do with the money. This would happen because enough people would demand it. This new relationship between corporation and workers already happens to some degree Germany with its incredibly successful economy and a peaceful revolution by the workers in Spain also managed to create successful worker run corporations almost over night. This would be moving from neoliberalism to full fat social democracy. Also expect to see the nationalisation of utilities. Of course that leads to the how - which is yet another question that would take even longer to answer but this conversation is at least part of that answer.

9) Stage 2 - Rather than hierarchical enormous corporations where wealth is siphoned off to a few shareholders.  Economic activity would be in the hands of cooperative worker led businesses that would serve human, environmental and community needs as core priorities for their reason to be. We would be creating smaller anarchic non-hierarchical systems dedicated to the common wealth. This would probably lead to less meat, less nuclear, less oil reliance as these are not easy to sustain in smaller self sustainable units. This would make for a much more resilient and independent nation. Again the how do we get here is a large and open question. Maybe we can't. But if we agree its desirable then it's down to all of us to decide what part of this revolution we want to play.",null,0,null,1430214330,null,0,1430217329,0,cqraa00,null,t3_344na6,null,t1_cqraa00,null,t1_cqr9m9k,null,null,null,1432648610,null,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25,null

&gt; Any advice on where to look?

I love Bristol if you don't mind the commute (although going out of Bristol in the morning is massively better than going in), Bath is also lovely and very family friendly although it gets very full of tourists. There are millions of beautiful Cotswolds villages to choose from if the countryside appeals.

I could advise more about Bristol but honestly I'd probably need to know a lot more about your financial situation as that dictates so much.

&gt; Is it too much of a risk to take at all?

Not at all - it's all very doable. There is no better time to move than now - whilst your kids are still young. It all seems incredibly intimidating from the outside but actually there is just a lot to do. Each individual step is very achievable when broken down and planned.

null,false,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,null,"&gt; Scottish councils are no more free free to put up councils tax as SNP are to put up income tax. On paper both can but in reality they can't.

The Scottish Government's ability to set income tax is limited both in scope (which bands) and size (by how much). Council tax isn't restricted in that way.

&gt; As you point out councils can breach the freeze to raise the level of council tax but if they do the Scottish Government will impose a three per cent penalty. This means that, to raise budgets by two per cent, councils would have to raise the tax by five per cent, an unrealistic proposition at any time.

I think the Herald are [confusing a 'penalty'](http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/letters/little-alternative-to-raising-council-tax.113954873) with the grant I mentioned. You're not penalised for raising council tax, you simply don't get the grant that was conditional on you *not* raising council tax.

The Scottish government are clearly using the council tax freeze as a populist policy, as are the UK government, and neither are going to be able to continue it forever. But in terms of ""are councils free to fund their own spending"" then I think the answer has to be yes.

I believe the SNP's longer-term plans are to replace Council Tax with a local income tax.

So yes, I would say that compared to issues like **two thirds** of voters not bothering with the EU elections, and the steady downward trend in turnout, that is pretty small. So perhaps the reason why spoilt ballots don't make the news is more because compared to voters not turning up, it barely happens, not because nobody cares.

If we look at binary choices, even on the AV referendum (an excellent opportunity to call for constitutional change), only **42%** of the electorate voted, and 0.59% of ballots were spoiled. Of the remaining ~58%, how do you distinguish between those who didn't vote because they didn't care, and those who didn't vote because they wanted different change? Contrast that with the Scottish referendum experience, where the campaign resulted in a **84.59%** voter turnout, (and only 0.09% spoilt ballots) despite Scotland having a lower turnout in ""normal"" elections than the UK average. It has galvanised politics in Scotland to the point where dozens of ""safe seats"" for one of the big two parties are going to be lost, and is potentially on the verge of breaking the two party system for good nationally.

In 2011 Tesco issued 'record profits of £3.8 Billion' - they do not pay their staff a living wage. As a result our tax has to go towards these people in the form of benefits and tax credits. It's not about 'redistributing wealth' it's about creating a fairer and more just society.

Our intention is to inform not mislead. 
In the Costs tab per MP we break down business costs and expenses separately for each MP so while in the case of  [Alistair Carmichael](https://rateyourmp.com/mp/1974/Mr-Alistair-Carmichael) you would expect his Travel expenses to be higher than average, we can see that he also has higher than average office and staff costs per year and the fact he is has been a Government Minister with a ministerial salary on top of the MP basic also increases his overall costs. 
Breaking these down by year in each case also allows you to see if an MP is managing their costs - in Alistair's case his expenses reduced YoY from 2011 (2010 is not a full year as its from date of the election) especially in 2013-14 with his travel expenses reducing, whilst his business costs increased - driven up from £103k in 2011 to £133k in 2013 (well above the Commons average of £84k). Our last [blog ](http://blog.rateyourmp.com/)article calls out that Staffing costs have increased each year since 2010 and is now the largest cost category - though there is massive disparity with some MPs having claimed over £500,000 for staff since 2010 and at least 1 MP who has not claimed anything for staff at all.

It's a frequent observation made by the local newspapers here that the general public as a whole utterly despise the local Stormont government and the politicians involved in it. It's frequently seen as a gravy train for these politicians and political parties to line their pockets from the public purse and not really having to DO anything to deserve it.

The problem is the unique nature of the local government where it's a mandatory coalition between unionist and nationalist parties. Because you don't have the same sort of government and opposition setup as you have with Westminster, the local parties here know that no matter what they do there isn't going to be any real consequences to any of their decisions which is why you frequently end up with endless deadlocks because anything unpopular can be vetoed by one of the two main parties (for their own political gain) so nothing gets done. It doesn't help that because the DUP and Sinn Fein are so dominant, they have the power to block/pass anything they like between them which means the smaller parties are utterly irrelevant.

If there was a more balanced spread of political parties to choose from you might have real progress but right now all that happens is most unionists vote DUP because they're the biggest unionist party to head off Sinn Fein. And of course most nationalists vote Sinn Fein as they're the biggest party with the power to head off the DUP.

null,false,iheke,null,null,null,"Proper marketing strategy is the answer. I expect the Marketing team is just sitting there saying just the above but there are still opportunities to be leveraged. Here is my five point plan:

1. Get engaged in US women's football - big time. I would be looking at 4 to 5 strategic teams to partner up with. We should be offering coaching staff up, we should be offering coaching days, we should be sponsoring some female teams - the bottom line is women's soccer is very popular in the US and we should be aiming to develop name recognition within the US female game.  (1A. We should be expeditionary. Everyone is focussing on the NE US opportunity and the South American influenced LA crowd. We're leaving opportunities on the table. The number one ranked womens soccer team is in Denver - the MLS franchise sucks - but there is a huge soccer supporting fan base there that is largely untapped. Again - Houston Tx are a crappy MLS franchise - but their womens soccer team (at A&amp;M is ranked 9th in the country) also they are passionate sports fans down there.)

2. We should be squeezing every last drop out of our US players. Yes, everyone knows about Yedlin. But Friedel, Dempsey and Keller should be doing an ambassadorial role for us. Not forgetting that Ryan Nelson is out there coaching for us.

3. Where is our Spurs store / sports bar in the US? We should have one with lots of TV screens showing global football year round. This should be about lifting the tide for everyone including us. It doesn't even matter if its largely loss making - the aim is that all soccer fans should have a space to come and watch soccer and if we're hosting/facilitating that we'll benefit.

4. Push those Jerseys. If there isn't already there should be a US sales team seeking to ensure that these Jerseys are available everywhere at cheap to giveaway prices. Our strategy should be that the very first Soccer jersey any American buys should be a Spurs jersey and push them relentlessly. We should have fashion tees and ranges that link with colleges (and other US sports teams) - there is no reason why there shouldn't be supporters clubs linked to popular MLB/NBA/NFL franchises and ""my other club is..."" ranges. But this is blank slate so we should be pursuing this aggressively.

5. Celebrity endorsements. Makes me sick to my gut to say this - but it matters. Ppl remember that nonsense.

null,false,orwellsocietyguy,null,null,null,"&gt;  the message is mainly the system is broken,

Exactly - fixing a lot of this would go a long way. Take one issue - housing... 

I don't want a missive house price crash, but if it came it wouldn't be the end of the world for me or most people I know who have made hundreds of thousands of pounds out of a London property - so a lowering of house prices I welcome.

Stamp Duty: the POINT of stamp duty is to tax those who are moving up the system - it's set up to tax those who have made money out of the system. The problem is that house prices are now so high that it's hitting people at 3% who are coming on for the first time. It's no longer a fair tax to regulate the system but a form of advanced capital gains tax.

Oversees buyers. There's plenty of people oversees buying up property to simply make money out of them. They avoid a lot of UK tax because they don't live here. This is bullshit. You want to buy a house here - you either damn well live here and pay tax or you get taxed to the eyeballs when you own it.

Social housing: very little is being built. What is built is being sold off.

Land ownership: Tesco owns half million square miles of land. A huge chunk of that is undeveloped. That's totally unacceptable for company to behave. If you want to buy land to simply sit on it and increase it's value then you should be taxed to the eyeballs or be forced to sell it.

These are obvious issues that need fixing. Companies that are repeat offenders should be threatened with breaking up and selling off. We don't need corporations that rape the markets for every penny whilst continually breaking the law. Balance needs building in to the system. That's the fundamental basis of a working capitalist system. It's got nothing to do with a socialist utopia and it's very doable, very quickly if our politicians had any balls.

The idea that parties be paid strictly from the public purse was mooted not so long ago. The fact that Britain has less of a problem with this than, say, the US, would also seem to indicate that we can meaningfully change how election campaigns are run and funded. (Though in the age of the Internet it is somewhat harder than it used to be.)

&gt; Because I would equally say that defending a system which is clearly corrupt, and has been since its inception hundreds of years ago, with the idea that it can be changed with just enough time (hundreds of years evidently not enough) marks you out as a naive fool.
&gt;
&gt; Besides, one of the main disadvantages of democratic government is that it enables the political class to block genuine change from ever occurring by making tiny gradual changes around the edges and convincing wishful thinkers that that is proof they will eventually one day change the system so that it works.

You seem to think that there is such thing as an ""ideal"" systems, or in your phrase a system that ""works"". This is gumf. Politics is not supposed to work for any individual, but is there to aggregate the competing and often contradictory desires of a given nation, or set of nations in the case of the EU and the UN.

As for whether  the Westminster system allow for genuine change, perhaps you should ask the suffragettes, or the slavery abolitionists or those that lobbied for universal education before it existed. Oh wait, you can't, because those causes are now so mainstream they are non-causes.

Until Parliament records &amp; publishes attendance then the only official &amp; consistent source indicating when a Member is in the house is the lobby record - and yes this is not 100% accurate either. So for now we are happy to use voting as an indication of activity - what we'd really love is visibility to constituency work. Again - we have to have consistent data so that comparisons across all MPs is fair. #Case workload / surgeries held, etc

Before we started this - we polled a range of people and when asked what they expected their MP to do for them the #1 response was represent them in the House of Commons by voting on their behalf. Its clear that's not the case in reality - and this is perhaps a piece of education MPs and Parliament itself needs to address. The most obvious example of this are the constituents of Buckingham whose MP cannot vote in the chamber ever as he is Speaker of the House. 

We've had some interesting conversations with former MPs - who have argued that due to being this or that their voting record has been impacted - but in each case we have been able to find examples where another MP with similar situation/role has a better voting record - we also wrote to every MP before we launched in March and offered them unedited 250 word space that we publish on their profile which they can use to defend their record - point out issues with the data - or whatever they want to say. Some responded, and those are published on their profile pages. We shall see if there are more in the next session.

Well exactly, that would be a system that works! The system we have today is a system which benefits an elite few in order to drag the rest of us up with them as a consequence.

You are right, there is no ""perfect"" system. But surely there is a better one?

&gt;As for whether the Westminster system allow for genuine change, perhaps you should ask the suffragettes, or the slavery abolitionists or those that lobbied for universal education before it existed. Oh wait, you can't, because those causes are now so mainstream they are non-causes. Amazing that such things got through given that change is impossible in our politics, or so slow as to be not worthwhile.

You realise all 3 of those movements were mass political movements, not orchestrated through the ballot box? They didn't vote in the parties making those policies out of the blue. They orchestrated mass political movements, protests, rallys, meetings which forced the political class to notice in a way voting **never** does. The political class then realised they had to act.

This is basically Russell Brands message. Many people think ticking the box every 5 (or in the past, slightly random number of) years, is job done. But can you name me one major societal change which came around through the ballot box as first cause - and not through the ballot box as last action in a mass movement which began outside it? What we need to do is direct action which forces change in a way voting never has.

I think you have the wrong idea of voting, you think politicians have ideals and put themselves up for a vote and the public pick the one they like most - I think politicians look at the public mood and offer the ideals they think will get them the most votes.

In England there are the two big parties: Labour (centre-left, comparable in relative size and and the party line being comparably liberal to the US Democratic Party) and Conservative (centre-right, the party line being comparable in conservatism to Conservative Democrats/Moderate Republicans, with the relative size comparable to the GOP/Republicans). This is roughly how it's been since the 20's (before Labour, there was the Liberal Party, we'll get to them shortly). The elections rely on seats, of which there is 650, and whichever party with the most seats wins. The system we use is called First Past The Post. [It's very flawed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo)

David Cameron is the PM; he represents the Conservative Party. Him and the Opposition leader, Ed Miliband (Labour) are currently very close to each other polls-wise, expected to get **33%** each.

Since the 80's, there's been an increase in third parties, starting with the SDP (a Labour offshoot)/Liberal (the party from before) deal, eventually becoming the Liberal Democrats in 1989. The SNP, a Labour offshoot commited to Scottish devolution, started in the 30's, maintained a surge in support between the 90's to 2010, where they now have a majority of the seats in Scotland. The Green Party, dedicated to green and left-wing politics, gained popularity recently. Last but not least, the UK Independence Party, once a liberal Eurosceptic party but now a populist-conservative party, started in 1994, has grown massively in the last three years, gaining lots of seats in the European Elections last year.

These third parties have caused the main parties to lose majority, and this causes problems. Either you start a minority government or you form a coalition. And so, it's these third parties that are important to monitor as they (specially the Liberal Democrats, the most popular) very much are going to control the election. In order for either the Conservatives/Labour to win, one would need to:

* Form a coalition with the SNP (est. 55 more seats, a clear majority)
* Form a coalition with LD and Green (est. 28 more seats, a slight majority)
* Form a coalition with LD, Green and PC (est. 31 more seats, a slightly better majority)
* Form a coalition with LD, Green, PC and UKIP (est. 32 more seats, a bigger majority but it would be a disaster)

And so these elections may be difficult to predict.

Edit: checking [The New Statesman's election calculator](http://may2015.com/category/seat-calculator/), it seems that a (Con/Lab)-SNP/(Con-Lab)SNP-LD coalition is the only to get a majority, which is 323 seats.",null,0,null,1430219537,null,0,1431248180,0,cqrbi37,null,t3_3444b5,null,t1_cqrbi37,null,t3_3444b5,null,null,null,1432649187,null,3,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,3,null

The world has changed since the way this system was set up and i genuinely do not believe this is going to work for much longer. 

I don't have the answer to what and how it needs to be changed. We are voting for people who will promise something for us, but once in power will not act on that promise. Maybe at the next elections, we look at the party who was in power, and if they have no substantial proof of attempting to act on their promise during the election campaign, then they don't get to run in the next elections.

I don't know. You're dammed if you do and you're dammed if you don't.  But i believe that if half the country doesn't vote then it will show just how unsupported and how unhappy people are with the current system which may then (or may not) lead to a new way of governing.

So people aren't voting for representation.  All the polls have shown that the majority of people in NI want marriage equality and the extension of the 1967 Abortion Act.

I hope that Nationalists too are only voting Sinn Fein to counterbalance the DUP, so without one we'd lose the other.

As for using issues for political gain, Sinn Fein have seen that the referendum in the Republic is going to pass with flying colours, so they're using an issue they knew couldn't pass at the minute to score points in the south.

&gt; This makes perfect sense. Wages for the rest of us have stagnated, but the rich have been doing just fine and they have increased wealth since crash (indeed all GDP growth that Tories talk about has gone to the rich). Given these facts they will be paying more than before, while the rest of us are static, thus increasing their share.

I fail to understand how this article is misleading in any way. The rich *are* paying more tax, both in absolute terms and also relative to the poor, and not only for the reasons you have given, but also because there have been huge tax cuts for the poorest in society in the last 5 years.

&gt;indeed all GDP growth that Tories talk about has gone to the rich

Oh come on, that's just a ludicrous statement! Unemployment has fallen from just under 8% to ~5.5% throughout this Parliament. Have all those jobs gone to the rich then?

It was because people didn't really care who the Police and Crime Commissioner for their area was, they really didn't see that their voice needed to be heard.

The CBD in Brisbane is very much like Covent Garden in London.

Another lovely place is Orsett which is close to Thurrock.  
  
When I was travelling up the Gold Coast, I found that Cairns was a bit similar to the atmosphere in Southend-on-Sea (again just with crappier weather!).  
  
Brentwood is a nice place to go for drinks.  You'll find the wannabe City folk drinking there too.  Brentwood is basically the birthing ground for that programme TOWIE.  Rich kids with no idea emulating what they think others want to see and hear.  
This is a minority of our population I can assure you!    
  
  
Leigh-on-Sea , Rayleigh and Old Leigh are lovely places to have a beer.

There are something like 11 pubs in a town that only has 8000 odd residents.  There is sailing there during the Summer and some lovely walks around its marina.

Other things, you don't have to pay for a bank account here.  Everyone offers a free one.  I had to pay like $5AUD a month for ANZ whilst I was in your neck of the woods.  
  
    
   

You'll have a choice of mobile phone companies rather than just Telstra!  
Satellite TV is provided by Sky, Virgin, BT and a few others.  Most offer phone and broadband in one package.    

Spiders here don't kill you.   

Snakes here don't kill you.    

Our speed limit is 70mph.    

You won't find Victoria Bitter here.     

There are zero public BBQs here :(   

Thongs are a type of underwear here.     

Not many people use the term 'spunky' to mean cool.     

Bugs/bats don't fill the sky from dusk onwards.   

Our speed cameras are painted yellow.  The A13 (the main road from Thurrock to London) uses average cameras.  
You'll have access to the BBC for advert free dramas and stuff which is alright.   

  
It is generalising but if you stay outside of the M25 (the oribital motorway that goes around London) then you're in a nice area usually.  Thurrock is on this suburb edge of where the shit joins the trees.  
  
If in doubt, count how many *fake* KFC / chicken shops you see.  The more there are, the shittier the place you are in.

You've literally stated that I can find the answers to ""all my questions"" ""if I buy this book"". And then qualify that with an incoherent and vague list of topics covered by the author - no-one of which have any immediately obvious relation to anything I said. That is textbook hucksterism. 

My complaint was that Brand's arguments don't have any substance, just jargon intended to make people who don't know any better feel that something has actually been said. But people who actually are knowledgeable in the field think of Brand as a dangerous joke.

How exactly does ""but Brand talks about Spanish social experiments"" disabuse me of that notion?

&gt; its perfectly possible to reference and admire a heavy weight academic and political theorist whilst disagreeing passionately on some of his positions.

What does that have to do with this situation right now, where you've clearly attempted to use Chomsky's name to give Brand credibility - trying to imply that Brand is an adherent to the former's philosophy - and its turned out that the one actual policy Russell Brand has is directly contradicted by the person you're claiming shares philosophical affinity with?

The PM is the leader of the party with the most MPs (so your equivalent would be Senate or House majority leader, I suppose).

Unlike you, we have a number of political parties to choose from. The main ones are Conservative (centre right), Labour (centre left), the Liberal Democrats (slightly left) and recently UKIP (UK Independence Party) have emerged as a main party (they're way over to the right and their main motivation is to withdraw us from the European Union and cut immigration). In Scotland they have the SNP (Scottish Nationalists) who forced a referendum to break Scotland away from the rest of the UK earlier this year (Scotland narrowly voted to remain part of the UK) and they're tipped to win heavily up in Scotland. Wales has their own national party (Plaid Cymru) too, and there are a few similar parties in Northern Ireland. There's also the Green party, the BNP (British Nationlists - waaaaaaaaaaaay over to the far right but fortunately quite a minor player these days) and a whole host of other tiny parties that spring up around election time, either with a view to getting someone to stand up for a particular issue in Parliament (e.g. the anti-war Respect party with one current MP), or as a joke party (such as the Monster Raving Loony Party).

He tells us that politicians are not to be trusted.

He says that the current political system is broken.

He says that young people, in particular are disenfranchised.

This is not new, deep political thought - it's stating a quite popular attitude amongst all of us.  It is, in a word, obvious.  Nothing wrong with that in itself - but when you start to use your influence to try to persuade people to become even less involved with our political system - flawed as it may be - and start talking about a *revolution*, well I would want to know what this revolution will involve.

Will it be violent? if not how will it work? will we all walk down Whitehall triumphantly waving Russels booky wooky in the air and see the establishment kneel before us, saying ""mea culpa"", pleading forgiveness and promising a better, more equal society?  No, sorry I'm being ridiculous, but then isn't Russell? what's his plan beyond ""let's have a revolution""?

He's great at telling us what's wrong - and he wraps it up in flowery language, but in a people's accent so he sounds both working class *and* intelligent.  It's a con trick and he's making money from it, and because he sounds like his heart's in the right place (maybe it is) a lot of us fall for it.  It's like he's wearing the emperor's clothes, to a lot of young (and some older) people to criticise him and try to examine what he's saying for anything of substance, apart from telling us what crap the establishment is, is to be a heretical, out of touch fuddy duddy. 

He's a comedian.  He should stick to a bit of campaigning about drugs and rehab, poke at the establishment and laugh at it alongside the rest of us.    Revolution?  bollocks.  He's a champagne Che Guevara who's caught the mood of a lot of people in a populist way, and is making it up as he's going along, probably in disbelief at how far he's come.

I'll leave you with a few quotes:

**Russell Brand on... the London riots**  
""When in 2011 young people all over Britain seemingly spontaneously decided to break the glass and snatch the idols from the altar, it was condemned as nihilistic and antisocial. That may be the case, what is more antisocial and nihilistic is the imposition of such dubious idolatry.""

**Russell Brand on... the Revolution**  
""The spiritual Revolution, the Revolution we are about to realise, will be fast because the organisms are in place; all that needs to shift is consciousness, and that moves rapidly.""

**Russell Brand on... the financial industry**  
""If my vacuum cleaner went nuts and forced me to live in economic slavery, I wouldn't roll my eyes and say 'Oh well' and humbly do its bidding. I'd turn it off and f--- it out the window.""  

Most of what he says belongs on a bumper sticker.  

OK so what do you think? has he come up with anything workable that we can use to fix our broken society?  because honestly, I think he's just a distraction from real life, and provides a convenient excuse for those too lazy to inform themselves about what's going on and to form their own opinions.

* Get insurance, landlords don't cover possessions or damage to property like leaks from over-run baths etc, it's cheap and worth having (under £30pm depending on level of cover)

* Are you having a bundle through Sky or Virgin to cover internet?  It's often cheaper than internet only, check with the agency as to existing connections and permissions required.  This is circa £50pm and cheaper than phone-line and broadband.

* TV Licence is around £12/£13pm on Direct Debit and easy to setup.

* Setup a contingency for white goods, put something like £40 away per month.  Once one goes they all catch on and tend to quit at the same time, this joint emergency fund is always going to cover things like end of tenancy cleaning etc.

* Check the inventory procedure with each agent, a lot do video inventories at the start of tenancy, make sure you get a signed copy and find out which permissions you need to decorate/put up shelves etc as some landlords will deduct for this.

I think those are my first thoughts, prepare and stash where you can it always helps.  Have a food fund for things like toilet rolls, milks, tea coffee but keep the main shop excluded as that causes squabbles.

What is interesting though is that the Conservative/Lib-Dem alliance sort of worked (nobody got exactly what they wanted, but the government was able to function). The old arguments against coalitions didn't apply.

Maybe Eoghan O'Connell can step up to the first team, he was given a new contract in February, and I assume Ronny had some say in that so he must like the look of the lad. 

Then there are options outwith the current squad. The club has a good scouting network so I don't doubt we can sign someone more than capable of replacing Denayer. 

As for Virgil leaving, I don't think that's a sure thing. Judging by the noises he's been making in recent weeks he really seems to understand what he's got at Celtic and I'm not entirely sure he'd leave for a club that's not involved in European competition.

Worst case scenario is they both leave, Virgil for a decent price, and Ronny brings in whoever he needs to fill the roles.

I say fuck no to the fact that you are trying to equate the cost of rebuilding an entire region (which is NOT what this money is intended for) with the cost of providing immediate emergency relief to people most severely affected (which IS what this money is for).

The fact that you don't realise there is a difference even now that someone has told you, shows how much thought you've put into this subject: None.

&gt; I pointed out an example in the last comment 

You have pointed out nothing. I asked for specific, you've given me a half baked vague approximation of this you think I might have meant - which is utterly pathetic. Case in point:

&gt; ""you're asking where do I get the information from that some people are generous and some people are stingy"". I don't have enough time to respond to things like that.

Oh, but you do have time to make up things that I supposedly said? I never asked you where you got information from ""that some people are generous and some people are stingy"" - that is a worthless question. I asked you literally where you got the information from that tells you who isn't paying their fair share - which is an entirely fair question to ask given that you've directly stated that people aren't paying their share.

And now, because you know you've made the mistake of saying things you have no proof for, you're pussying out. No-one is buying your ""I don't have time"" bullshit.

Yes, we played like shit against Ludogorets but, generally, when we've been beaten we haven't been massively outplayed. We've created chances and not taken them. Our defence has been competent, I actually think our midfield has pretty good, especially when Lucas has been fit and playing. 

 Our primary issue this season has been chance conversion, and this has been poor because we've played half the season without a striker on the pitch. We haven't scored the goals we should have, and this has cost us games.

  I'm confused as to why you say we can't defend when Mingolet has more clean sheets than any other 'keeper in the league. Look at the top goal scorers, and we don't have anyone in the top ten. Arsenal, Spurs, Man Utd, Man City and Chelsea (the teams we are competing against) all have at least one player in the list. 

 Only Chelsea have conceded considerably fewer goals than us. We are on 36, along with Man City. Man Utd are on 34 and Arsenal are on 32. 

 In terms of goals scored, we are level with Southampton on 47. Spurs are on 55, Utd on 59, Arsenal on 63, Chelsea on 65 and Man City on 70. 

  Our defence is on a par with the other top sides. We don't score enough goals. That is literally it. That's the reason we're in 5th place and not 3rd or 2nd. If we spend our money on defenders and DMs we'll win fuck all next season. We don't need to improve our defence. We don't need to improve our midfield. 

  We are fourth in terms of chances created. Only Arsenal, Man City and Chelsea have created more. We have taken the third highest number of shots this season. We haven't converted enough of them because we don't have any reliable strikers, and you can't rely on midfielders to carry the goalscoring weight of the team. 

 TL;DR We need strikers. We don't need any other type of player. Our defence and midfield are adequate. We need to score more goals. Not scoring enough is why we are going to miss out on Champs league.",null,0,null,1430225629,null,0,false,0,cqrdlc9,null,t3_344xh7,null,t1_cqrdlc9,null,t1_cqrcwfs,null,null,null,1432650171,null,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8,null

Secondly, considering that Suarez was off our wage bill we had £230,000 a week in wages to play with, I think we offered him a £140,000 a week, £15,000 more than what Arsenal offered but that wasn't enough and instead of improving that offer we just said fuck it and walked away from the deal.

This is what annoys me the most. 

I really wish he moved on last year because I feel he's damaged his reputation as one of the greatest midfielders ever over the past 18 months. 

When people talk about him now they talk about his loyalty, his longevity and his leadership. Not so much about is absolutely incredible ability, athleticism, instinctiveness etc that made him the best midfielder in Europe at a time. 

2005-2009 he was genuinely a contender for the best midfielder in Europe every year and was without a doubt the best for some of them. He's been in the team of the year like 8 times now I think? 

I hate the Scholes Gerrard debate so much. Scholes aged better, no doubt about it, but when both of them were at their peak, Scholes was not in the conversation - no where near it. It was the Gerrard V Lampard debate and Scholes was just another top midfielder. Now peoples most recent memories are of Scholes doing very well at united at 34, and Stevie not so much for us at 34.

It really saddens me to think that's how a lot of English fans will remember him and not as the talisman in midfield who changed games single-handedly on a weekly basis. It's overused but Istanbul....wow, I cannot ever remember one player having as big an impact on a game of that magnitude. We talk about Alonso and Carragher and dudek that night but Stevie grabbed that game by the scruff and threw us over the line.

He hasn't been mentioned in any injury updates from Brendan in his press conferences since at least the new year (and probably even before than that). Obviously a lot of people want to point out Brendan's faults lately, but one thing I think he has done really well and been very consistent on is his mantra that if you work hard in training, there is always a way back into the match day squad. We haven't seen Enrique in one for months, save for the odd cup game here and there.

If there is one thing you should absolutely not skimp on in the purchase of a property, its surveying and conveyancing. They are absolutely vital.

Don't be afraid to dish out an extra few hundred quid if you like them. The key for a good conveyancer is competence and responsiveness. The cost of conveyancing doesn't vary much from one property price to another. Unfortunately, because your property costs sub £100k you can't really capitalise on the economies of scale. For example, the penthouse of your new build which might go for 5x as much as your potential property doesn't have much additional legal work compared to your property.

The benefit of this is that when you come to buy a property the government will contribute an additional 25% (up to £3,000) towards the property purchase. So, if you save £12,000 you will have a £15,000 deposit.

The reason I say it may be worth holding off is that if you invest in a cash ISA this year you will not be able to invest in the new buyers ISA this tax year.

The only 'skepticism' I can assume you refer to is me addressing that Chelsea have more money than us so they can afford to sign flops, and that Spurs and other clubs collectively 'outmaneuvered' us in the transfer market because they were willing to pay higher wages. May I remind you that I provided evidence to back this statement in which the signings of at least Gulfi Sigurdsson and Lewis Holtby were hijacked by Spurs because **they came in offered more in wages**. If you were to revisit my initial comment, the first statement was clearly in reference to Chelsea, and the second part of the sentence was a response to the second statement of the comment I was replying to. This of course was before **YOU** came in on your high horse and laughed at me for suggesting Spurs had more money than us.

&gt;Voting helps perpetuate first-past-the-post and thus actively does harm to our democracy by perpetuating a semi-democracy.

&gt;If no one participates, there is no voting system. Therefore the credibility of any given voting system scales in relation to the level of participation. If the level of participation is high, it lends the voting system credibility, but if it's low, it hurts the voting systems credibility. It's far easier to argue FPTP should be scrapped if it has a 35% turnout than if it has a 90% turnout.

&gt;It's essentially the same idea as voting with your wallet, but with votes. I think most of us recognize that companies are far less receptive to customer complaints until it starts to affect their bottom line. If you threaten to cancel your service, subscription or whatever, most companies will suddenly go ""woah, hang on now, lets not be hasty. Maybe something could be worked out"". Similarly, political parties will keep on keeping on until they start to lose votes. This is the very argument he uses to justify voting for smaller parties or spoiling your ballot. If they stop getting your votes, they want to win them back and adjust accordingly.

&gt;You can apply the same thing to the voting system. If you continue to plug votes in, it has very little reason to change. You're doing what it requires to succeed. As such, it is nigh-impossible to vote in a way that will harm first past the post more than it will help it, because merely participating helps prop it up more than it contributes to tearing it down. There is one exception which is specific to FPTP however and that's hung parliaments. If you're in a contested seat and you can help someone win that makes a hung parliament more likely, you should absolutely do so (according to current polls, reducing tory seats seems to be desirable to that end). This is because FPTP aims to avoid hung parliaments and thus they damage its credibility along with low turnout.

The fact is, it's not the government's job to represent you, it's the voting system's job to represent you and the government is the result of that representation. Voting to change the government won't solve the problem because the government's not the problem, the voting system is.

... Disclosure: I am one.

But good question OP, I'm curious as well. I've stated it on here before, but I went to a game last season and fell in love with the club. I went without knowing a whole lot, but the more I read and learned afterwards the more I felt like this was a team I could get behind. I never had a rooting interest in an English team before, although I of course watched the PL. But now it's so much more fun. Plus the city seemed to have a lot in common with my city over here. Port town, historic, same relative size, etc.

The people I met in the city and at St. Mary's were very nice. They didn't give me crap for my obvious tourist approach of taking pictures of the stadium haha. I did get some funny looks after the game when I took a picture with my hometown team's scarf, but I hid it and waited for most of the crowd to clear out just in case people got the wrong impression ;)

It's funny explaining why I became a fan to my friends of the big 4 over here (which is everyone I know except for one West Ham supporter, but he grew up two blocks away from the stadium so I don't count that.) I'm like no, seriously, I was really pessimistic going into the season and was prepared for a relegation fight, so this season has been amazing. 

I'm slowly learning the history, but I know I'll never get it down like lifelong fans. 

Anyway, I will definitely be making another trip to Southampton someday in the not so distant future, this time with my Saints scarf. Maybe I'll share a drink with some of you guys on here.

EDIT: Remembered a funny story. Several years ago, Portsmouth came to my city to play a friendly against my local team. I met that crazy Westwood guy before the game in the parking lot, and later on ran into a guy I used to work with. He was wearing a Saints jersey and explained why. Hahaha.

I fundamentally disagree, I believe it's up to politicians to make sure markets work correctly, that monopolies and oligopolies don't form, that workers and consumers aren't exploited, that the proper infrastructure is available, that wealth is redistributed to address the tenancy under capitalism for wealth to concentrate to a few elites, that workers are kept healthy and the unemployed have the safety net of the welfare state to rely on. Not to mention the state is itself a huge employer.

&gt; Anyway, everything you've said seems to apply much better to the shareholder analogy than to employer one. It seems the employer analogy is preferred as it implies a stronger sense of power (which doesn't actually exist and neither should it) over our MPs.

Again I disagree, we do in theory have a lot of power over politicians, we are the ones hiring and firing them, they come to us to try and convince them to give them the job or allow them to keep it.

null,false,MaesterWeasel,null,null,null,"I can't comment thoroughly on that, I didn't watch Swansea that closely at that time. Did you? You have to consider the financial backing he had in those clubs. But what we do know is that he gave Swansea a very good shape and gave them a solid base to become a regular Premier League team. 

To clear something up. Is it that common for top club manager to make every signing by himself? I thought it's rather unusual if anything. And reading your post I assume that you assume that Rodgers makes those signings himself? Top clubs are usually built with a structure where changing a manager doesn't change the club. Meaning that there is a person or an part of a structure that is planning the main path for the manager, Director of Football or Transfer Committee or something similar. We had ours in place by the time Rodgers signed.

Manager usually gets some of 'his' guys in but it's a minority. Like Rodgers got Allen and Borini. They were definitely 'his' guys. Other than those few it looks exactly like FSG's plan - younger signings with an occasional experienced player. Unfortunately, those more experienced players have failed pretty miserably lately and that has put us back some a season or two as our experienced players are getting old and it takes couple of seasons for even guys like Henderson or Allen to reach their prime. 

So, a question: how much can we criticise Rodgers if we don't know which signings were completely his choice and which ones were chosen by the TC and got green light by Rodgers. Remember, Rodgers giving a green light to a signing doesn't make it his. James Pearce's opinion was that this ""final word"" over transfers was supposed be that sign of ""full control"" but it allows some situations like this happen: Rodgers wants a players but majority of the committee votes against it and Rodgers won't get the player. Purely my opinion, but that doesn't seem like anywhere near full control. 

Fuck, I dragged it too long again. It's complicated because we don't know who wanted who and which signings are part of FSG's project.",null,0,null,1430229900,null,0,false,0,cqrfnnv,null,t3_340lmr,null,t1_cqrfnnv,null,t1_cqrchhd,null,null,null,1432651215,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

How is that any different from what happens now? Today they see low turnout, and assume that voters are just apathetic. At least spoilt ballots can't be explained away by apathy.

&gt; If you convince that 20% not to show up, and then also have the 30% who wouldn't show up anyways, the government can now only say ""We've been elected on a 50% turnout"".

They say the percentage that voted for them, the turnout being low will make the news, but the percentages for each party are what are reported. If an incumbent is re-elected with less than a third of the vote, and the second place candidate is ""none of the above"" or ""proportional representation now"" wouldn't that send a rather more potent message? For example, the 2014 EU elections, the news was all about UKIP ""winning"" the election, and barely anyone mentioned that with the 35.6% turnout, their 26.6 % of the vote was only 9.5% of the electorate.

&gt; Basically in one way you are right, not voting for many people is laziness or apathy, but those people will always exist. Even in Scotland 15% didn't bother their arse to vote on the outcome of the most direct influence vote in centuries.

That referendum turnout is higher than the national one for any general election since the introduction of universal suffrage. The renewed interest in politics there has lead to colossal change in Scotland (and potentially soon, nationally). I would say that is a rather stronger argument for participation by voting for parties aside from the main three.

&gt; Use them! 

Everyone already knows there are millions who can't be bothered, just because somebody is calling for an election boycott, doesn't mean those people will be included in the protest by popular perception.

&gt; Spoiling your vote makes it seem like you can be won back, not voting at all makes it seem like you think the system is irrelevant.

Firstly, I personally would rather advocate voting for an honest minor party candidate instead of spoiling your ballot, and only advocate spoiling if you do not feel there is one. However, I still do not understand what you hope to achieve by not voting.

So, let's say that lots of people don't vote, what do you honestly think is likely to happen? How do you think change is going to be achieved outside of current democratic means?

&gt; Given that the government does not control inflation 

You clearly do not understand economics.   For a start the Gov sets borrowing rates and has done Quantitative easing.  Next is VAT and that is a very regressive tax (impacts poor much more as % of buying power), and then to dismiss *only* 1/6 of population having below inflation raises for 5 years shows an amazing level of ignorance.

&gt; what would this govt have had to do to win your seal of approval

A simple answer, less austerity.  It is simply the transfer of wealth from poor to the rich.  This is self evident given the huge increases in wealth by the rich in past 5 years, while the poor are worse off.  This is a Tory ideal and don't expect you to agree with me.

Yeah this is my biggest issue with him. According to a post game presser from Brendan early in the season, [he didn't use to mark on corners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edycNMGB-ZI).

What the fuck was he doing in his development years? He's the poster boy of lots of talent but fuck all in terms of intelligence, mentality and hard work.

Yes, that's what happened, a narrow majority voted no, and whether or not it's annoying to redditors, the numbers don't lie.

Nope, these people didn't just wander into the room — they were elected by the population of the country. As for opinion polls, I'm sure you're old-enough to know by now that you can get an opinion poll to say anything you want, and happening to agree with something isn't a valid way of ascertaining the reliability of a result. The only reliable opinion poll is an election. If individual people think it's important enough to warrant it then they can choose not to elect those who voted in a particular way next time there's an election, and if they choose not to do that ... then you draw your own conclusions about what they really think, and accept the choice a population of individuals has made.

However, to just automatically assign the seat to him (or to create a constituency specifically for the Speaker) would be undemocratic.

we need to buy, in this order, RB, ST and CM. these are our big problem areas and i think we could spend 50-75m in these areas.

10-15m on a rb (janmaat?), 20-30m on a st (Vietto, dybala, icardi, adriano, depay?), 20-30m on a cm (pjanic, gonalons, gundogan, nainggolan, draxler?) obviously milner is a freebie and we could actually sign 2 cm's plausibly if we get milner and someone else. if we got janmaat, vietto (for the 12m release clauase i keep seeing), and nainggolan (30m) + milner, i would say that's not bad business, 57m + wages and we have 4 players who could all walk into the starting line up and do a job.

I was playing a rave up in Scotland in 1994 and this guys comes over to me and says: Can I borrow your keyboard rig for my PA? 

No problem I says scratching my head. I kinda recognised him, but couldn't think where from. 

Anyway cut too it's Keith Harris and Orville on my Keyboard rig in front of 3000 off their heads Scottish ravers mostly on speed and pills and he's doing a rave version of ""I wish I could fly"" with this remote control fucking Orville that flaps its wings.

The place goes mad. 

Surreal. 

Gig over Keith comes up and thanks me. No problem I says. 

Turns out we're in the dressing room next door to Keith and Orville and he's gone for a walk about. 

So... my mate decides it's a good idea to nick remote control Orville and stick him right up in the lighting tower. We're pissing ourselves laughing standing backstage, little Orville way up in the rigging with his wings flapping around. 

As you do. 

Keith Harris comes flying out of his dressing room in a fit of rage, proper red faced, he grabs my mate and he screams : ( verbatim ) Where's the fucking bird you cunts!! 

By this point I'm doubled over laughing trying to point up at the lighting tower with poor little stranded Orville right up in the Sky. 

Fucking funny as. I nearly wet myself. 

Luckily in the end little Orville was rescued and Keith, being the good sport he was,  saw the joke.
 
I'll never forget that night though, so thanks for the laughs Keith mate ;)

Regarding your point here, isn't the last few years an example of 'austerity bring a country out of recession'? Perhaps not, it just happened to happen as well. It's so hard to name any one factor as having done this, but you could say that about stimulus plans too. Economies recover, and measures taken to expedite that may or may not have acted as genuine catalysts. I remember hearing that in the case of the American 'New Deal', some historians posit it may have actually delayed recovery by a number of years, but because the economy still recovered eventually, it gained credit and respect.

Wow, in that case you must be right.

&gt;For a start the Gov sets borrowing rates and has done Quantitative easing

Nope, that's the BoE and they are independent of government. Besides which, are you saying We shouldn't have done QE or lowered interest rates? You're on shaky ground there, considering the UK/US example has since been followed in both Japan and Europe. Trying to control externally caused inflation by raising domestic interest rates would have been a fucking monumentally stupid thing to do.

&gt;Next is VAT and that is a very regressive tax (impacts poor much more as % of buying power)

True, but almost all essential goods are VAT except. So admittedly the poor will struggle to buy a new plasma TV relative to the rich, but this is not the case for things like food or clothing. So most day to day expenses will not have been hit by the VAT rise, and to say the poor are ""much worse off"" as a result of government policy is clearly not true, especially when considering this is balanced by the fact that they're paying FAR less income tax than they were.

&gt;to dismiss only 1/6 of population having below inflation raises for 5 years shows an amazing level of ignorance.

I didn't dismiss anything, you're trying to twist my words and it only shows the weakness of your argument. I simply pointed out that you using below inflation pay rises for public sector workers as proof that the poor are worse off as a result of government policy is categorically wrong because most of the poor don't work in the public sector.

&gt;A simple answer, less austerity. It is simply the transfer of wealth from poor to the rich. This is self evident given the huge increases in wealth by the rich in past 5 years, while the poor are worse off. This is a Tory ideal and don't expect you to agree with me.

Obviously we needed to cut spending on public services.... but I'm not going to get into this. If I do, you'll be telling me how ""I don't understand how Govt borrowing works"" and trying to tell me how Govt didn't need to cut spending and could have simply borrowed all the money in the world with no consequences. I've seen it all before from you.

Food wise you could take a look at Tesco or Asda and do a virtual shop for the things you'd normally buy to give you an idea. These are 2 of the major supermarkets in the UK. You'll have plenty of choice within spitting distance no matter where you end up living.

&amp;nbsp;

Common grub, really there's no specific local dish like you get with a lot of places. Popular stuff like Fish and Chips, Indian, Chinese are common take aways, you also get the usual KFC, Burger King and McDonalds.

&amp;nbsp;

Community, I can't say, all I do know is it's beside what we at work call Basildump. Beyond that I've been there once and will be unlikely to do it again, it's just an average town/city.

&amp;nbsp;

Winter is usually mildest in Essex as a whole of the UK. Average rainfall is often lowest here. It does snow....apparently, I've yet to see any real amount of snow. However winter can generally be cold and require a good coat but it's not Arctic tundra.

&amp;nbsp;

Pub question, probably not if you keep quite. Football fans are not generally agressive like you'll see in films, most are well behaved and high spirited. The only thing to watch out for really is bad mouthing a particular team when in the presence of a group of their fans, as that could cause you trouble. If you don't follow it then say nothing bad about it and you'll be fine.

&amp;nbsp;

Public transport wise these pages are 2 of the main bus companies so gives an idea of the costs of getting about.

Those should help

Renting wise depending on your budget and wages this site can make life a bit easier to work out what you can afford. Beware with renting in the UK as agents often don't clearly advertise their fees to move into places and I've seen figures as much as £300 for the first tenant and £150 for any others + first months rent and additional admin fees on top of that.

&amp;nbsp;

Driving a car
www.autotrader.co.uk - ideal to get an idea about what you'd pay to buy a car
www.petrolprices.com - a good way of getting up to date prices for the cost of fuel
www.confused.com - cost of insurance, run a few number plates from auto trader through and you can get an idea of the cost of insurance (it's very expensive for young drivers under 25)

null,false,wanson,lfc68,,null,"&gt; Sterling's scored 7 goals all season and most of them weren't as a striker.

That's more than Balotelli, Lambert and Borini combined.

He has not been prolific by any stretch of the imagination but thad doesn't take away the fact that we have performed much better this season, and got results in games, when Sterling has played up front.

It's not the way to go in the future and we need to bring in a quality striker in the summer. But **for now** this is our best option. There are 5 games left this season. We should be trying to win them all. 4th place is still possible (improbable but possible). Even without 4th we don't want to be passed by Spurs and Southampton and risk finishing 7th. You win games by doing what has worked in the past and by picking your best performing players.

Sterling has worked. Balotelli has not. Borini has not. Yesil is an U-21 player that has been injured for 2 years. He might come good. But right now we need to win games and you don't do that by dropping a senior player for an unproven youth player. If we play Yesil it means dropping a more established player. 

&gt;Not sure what you mean by experiment in the summer (we don't have any games), I'd prefer to experiment now than at the start of next season (and risk falling behind).

You've never heard of pre-season friendlies? Besides, this season isn't over yet!

&gt;Also if we fork out 30m for a new striker but then experiment with Yesil and he scores 7 in 5, the new guy might end up being a pointless waste of money (btw I'm not suggesting Yesil is definitely going to be any good but we won't know until he gets a chance).

So. We let's say we buy Lacazette as our hypothetical 30m striker. We give Yesil a run out in pre-season and he scores for fun. First day of the season, who do we start?

**We start Lacazette of course!** 

If Yesil shows promise you ease him in to the side in cup games and at the end of games that have been won.

&gt;FREEZER TIPS
&gt;
- Label and date bags clearly so you can rotate food efficiently.
- Freeze food as soon as possible after purchase and always within the use by date.
- Once food is frozen consume within 1 month.
- Once food has defrosted use the same day.
- Cook vegetables from frozen.
- Freeze food in meal size portions for convenience and to avoid waste.

Then it has those white squares for date and contents.

On the package it comes in, there are some instructions on how to open the freezer bag and how to use them but they're very simple and I'm sure you know how it works. There are also some cautions that I'll type out in case they're helpful to you.
&gt;
- To avoid the danger of suffocation, please keep bags away from babies and small children.
- Allow hot food to cool fully before putting into the bags.
- Not suitable for REHEATING or COOKING in a microwave oven.
- When a microwave oven is used for defrosting, always refer to the manufacturer's handbook for instructions.
- Before use in a microwave oven, pierce the film at the top of the bag to allow steam to escape.
- DO not refreeze after defrosting.
- NOT suitable for use in conventional ovens.
- Ensure that food is completely thawed before reheating or cooking.
- After emptying the bag, check that no plastic has stuck to the contents.
- To prevent bags from splitting when freezing, do NOT overfill.

Lastly, if you're interested the small bags are apparently 180mm x 220mm. Hope this helped.",null,0,null,1430234168,null,0,false,0,cqri4b9,null,t3_345phf,null,t1_cqri4b9,null,t3_345phf,null,null,null,1432652376,null,43,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,43,null

Many countries around the world, including multiple first world countries with stable democracies and economies, use PR to great effect, and the scenario you describe can easily be avoided by introducing a minimum threshold for a party to enter parliament, such as modern-day Germany does (where any party needs at least 5% of the national vote to be represented). A system which allows a party with 11% vote share to gain 11% representation is much better IMO than that party getting 0% representation, which can and does frequently happen with FPTP.

This example is incorrect because my stated views on murder and torture are not comparable to Idi Amin's views on murder and torture. I share other things with him, like being male and being human, but those are not relevant to the issue of murder and torture since they don't logically imply any specific opinion on those issues (the same applies to your new example of the MRA; being a men's rights advocate does not logically imply being a rapist or a murderer).

To put it simply: if my stated views on murder and torture were the same as Idi Amin's stated views on murder and torture, it would be fair and logical to assume that I shared his views and approved of his actions unless I specifically said otherwise.

Therefore, since the stated view of the vast majority of feminists is that ""patriarchy"" should be opposed and the stated view of the minority of feminists taking the reported actions is that ""patriarchy"" should be opposed, it is fair and logical to assume that the vast majority of feminists share that minority's views and approve of their actions unless they say otherwise.",null,0,null,1430234392,null,0,false,0,cqri9c9,null,t3_345382,null,t1_cqri9c9,null,t1_cqrhb29,null,null,null,1432652442,null,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3,null

Holy shit. Someone who doesn't understand polling and sampling? Well I would say I'm surprised but that would be a lie. 

&gt; The only reliable opinion poll is an election

Because literally the only policy of the parties is whether gay marriage should be allowed right? Because literally the only reason that a person votes for a party is to give their opinion on whether gay marriage should be allowed?

 Tell me. Do you agree with every single policy of the MLA or MP that you vote for? Would you say that they could vote on literally any issue and it would be an accurate reflection of all 17,000 or so voters who voted for them? That if you went out and asked every person in a constituency what they thought on every issue every voter's opinion would be identical to that of their preferred candidate on every single subject?

&gt;Anyway, as the article said, this is silly politicking, and has nothing to do with LGBT issues anyway

Yes. Voting on LGBT issues has nothing to do with LGBT issues right? It's literally nothing to do with them.

I am, as an individual, more of a saver than a spender, and debt causes me anxiety, so politicians pledging to deal with national debt as a priority hold a visceral appeal to me. Perhaps that is not the same thing as it being the most important thing in objective reality, because political and economic reality is a lot more complicated than the world of personal finance.

I do also like to read mostly about social problems and I feel they probably have their finger on the pulse on this kind of thing a bit more than other papers, however I do feel they rely too much on anecdotal evidence to often support their claims. Like they will often seek out horrible, individual cases where someone has been truly bent over by benefit delays/bedroom tax or whatever and then try and spin this as the norm. I'm pretty sceptical of a lot of these, to me it seems pretty similar to 'family on benefits with 20 kids and huge tv gets new house built for them by the taxpayer, and its being built by immigrants' drivel you see, and whilst horrible I don't believe it is a fair representation of what is happening across the country. It is a clever editorial tactic because it is almost impossible not to sympathise with that individual's situation and they then channel that to try and provoke anger in the establishment. Or maybe I am just a psychotic who should feel more empathy.

I would recommend the economist, like you say (although it's writing style is a bit pompous I sometimes find!), or the FT. Both provide excellent, pragmatic commentary without a lot of the sensationalism/scaremongering and blatant editorial bias you find in the guardian/telegraph/spectator/new statesman. And unlike the pieces in these papers they often back up what they say with decent reputable facts and sources, rather than making a series of unsubstantiated claims (or link to articles on their own website with more unsubstantiated claims, or link to articles from other organisations with vested interests) to try and get people angry and divide the country (rich vs poor, immigrant vs indigenous, politican vs public etc.) to further a political agenda in which they care more about beating their opponents to satisfy their own ego/lust for power rather than trying to actually make the country a better for the rest of us.

null,false,frckls29,null,null,null,"Heya stufstuf. I *totally* feel you. I made a crazy decision to move halfway across the world to be with my boyfriend, lost a job and was jobless for almost a year. I had a job offer from an international law firm back home right when I just decided to move in here, so I turned it down. My expertise isn't exactly easily transferable cross-border (as in they would always pick a local or EU citizen first). I have only a handful of friends here who are mostly expats, so I've lost 4 close ones within a year. To top it off, I never manage to bring myself to enjoy living here. I keep finding reasons to hate it. I call this island ""the purgatory.""

For months, my boyfriend supported both of us and I almost died out of boredom and desperation. Because of that, neither of us has been home (he's Mexican, I'm Indonesian, what are the odds, eh?) for almost 2 years. I hate not being able to live my life the way I did back home and in the Netherlands, all the fun and challenge at work. I *hate* having to ask for money, it feels embarrassing for me. I love being appreciated in what I do intellectually and I don't get that in here.

Not being able to randomly call a close friend to grab a nice dinner and cocktail or wine after a long day of work (my best friends back home are lawyers, too, so we often had very late dinner and drinks) also killed me. In here, people tend to stay home after work.

Just like you, I felt helpless, useless, frustrated and lost all kind of motivation. My confidence was shot down terribly. I have never felt so small and insecure for the longest time. I cried too many times than I'd like to. I know I was being a whiner and there are many more unfortunate people out there, but shaking off all the negative feelings is easier said than done. My boyfriend's best advice is  to ""suck it up/grow a pair"", which isn't exactly always helpful, but he's always there for me. But other than that, I've never felt so lonely in my whole life.

I can only say that there's (there should be!) a silver lining. I hate this place and can't wait to move on to the next, but I need to be patient to gain enough professional experience that can bring me out of here. Perhaps, this is your ""purgatory"". In any case, purgatory doesn't last forever and hopefully we'll reap the benefit in the coming future. Cherish the fact that you have someone loving you. Don't lose hope. I haven't lost mine. :)

Transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy will be a painful one no matter when it needs to happen (and the longer we put it off, the more dramatic the change will need to be). At least an independent Scotland could have stopped issuing subsidies for oil well exploration.

null,false,HJonGoldrake,eng-GreaterLondon,London,null,"&gt; So, in policy terms, that's goverment-backed business loan schemes

Yes, but even more importantly research grants and startup grants. So many innovative American companies were born out of publicly-backed research (with the researchers then moving on to do their own thing) and initial public-backed funding. This is the kind of money that lets people work on their initial idea; private money is then indispensable to take it to market and make it a real business, but it doesn't get to that point if people can't do that seminal work.

&gt; removing red tape for small businesses to expand more easily

Yes, especially in terms of simplying (and even fiscally incentivizing) mergers and acquisitions among small companies. It's better for innovation that new players grow big than old established companies buy them out.

&gt; I am, as an individual, more of a saver than a spender, and debt causes me anxiety

Me too, but macroeconomics is different; if the government cuts back on spending, that shrinks the economy, which reduces tax receipts, which creates a cycle. Government spending has an effect called fiscal multiplier, which means that for every pound the government spends a certain way the economy actually grows by more than one pound; and the reserve goes for spending cuts.

Right now, we can afford to borrow cheaply, and spending this money the right way can grow our economy, so that when rates go up in the future we have a bigger stronger economy and can cut back on the spending and have a much easier time paying down the debt.

Because nothing works better to make money than by printing cartoons that will get you murdered. Brilliant observation!

&gt; Those pictures are offensive to a number of ethnic minorities, if not most of the ethnic minorities in France. 

Yes, you polled them. Also, no one cares about what offends people. No one. 

&gt; Charlie Hebdo helps nobody and its images ONLY serve to cause offence

On the contrary, Charlie Hebdo upheld freedom of speech, which you are desperate to attack, because people might say things that hurt your feels.

&gt; In the case of Charlie Hebdo, its satire was objectively racist and Islamophobic.

At first, the far-left PC police used the word 'Islamophobia' to silence any criticism of this very peaceful and pro-woman's rights religion known as Islam. Now they have sunk so far that they're actually claiming that printing a cartoon mocking a religious figure is 'Islamophobic' - just in case anyone did not realize what they were doing.

As for racism: thanks for showing that the far-left PC police will use someone's **opposition** and mockery of racism to slander them as racists. Your lack of morals is absolutely stunning.

A lot has changed in the last 40 years, in terms of technological advances, demographic shifts, popular support for paramilitaries, membership numbers of paramilitaries etc.

&gt; If the authorities could just ""crack down"" on them they wouldn't exist today or before.

They don't pose a big enough threat. The 'New IRA' (or whatever they're calling themselves nowadays) posed more threat and sure didn't we see 12~+(?) leadership members being arrested there a while back during a leadership meeting, after it was revealed that the PSNI &amp; Gardai had been tracking, bugging, and surveilling them for 6-12~ months just to gather plenty of evidence against them?

Now imagine Ireland reunified - obviously activity would surge in loyalist paramilitaries. With that surge of activity would also be a surge in crackdowns and arrests done by the Guards. The IRA, INLA, CIRA, RIRA etc etc would be disbanded instantly with reunification as well (well, at least it would be further splintered to the point of 1-2 lunatics fighting for some perceived grievance about how the united Ireland came around).

So now you've only one faction to focus on - that means you've more resources to focus on that faction, which allows for further cracking down.

It ensures that politicians don't just go ""well this is just an issue caused by foreign people, cut down on foreign people and we have dealt with people"", when it is a more fundamental issue that can't just be handwaved by saying its not our problem.

No-one is suggesting to ignore electoral fraud. But the problem is bringing up race takes the discussion down a path that is completely counter-productive towards finding a solution. 

The problem here is that our electoral system doesn't do enough to prevent fraud. [The Electoral Commission has warned for years](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22518404) that our system has serious flaws. Yet instead of doing anything about that, the media and the people focus only on the fact that those committing the fraud happen to be South Asian and instead of discussing how to improve the security of elections, we discuss how to deal with the problem of ""bad immigrants"" instead (even though in most cases, these South Asians are actually full British citizens and therefore aren't actually immigrants).

EDIT: The Rotherham case is a perfect example of this, the inquiry revealed a very long report which showed that it was a fundamental failing across the board: the failure of police to take the girls reports seriously because of the class of the girls (such as the policeman who said ""well they looked like they were whores anyway so probably consented""), the failure of the council to act on the complaints etc. Yet people, when discussing the issue, only focus on the 4 pages which address the race element. So here we have a situation where the police and council get off the hook on their general incompetence as the debate has moved towards ""we need to be less politically correct"". Nothing has been done about the fact that the police were clearly being classist and sexist, because everyone has ignored that part in favour of a discussion about race.",null,0,null,1430238089,null,0,1430238562,0,cqrkl37,null,t3_341z01,null,t1_cqrkl37,null,t1_cqrk6xr,null,null,null,1432653537,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

People don't understand the nature of democracy (at least not in this country). Democracy is relatively new concept in Britain and people don't understand that it isn't something that has always existed and never changes. This country (and most other countries) have been in a period of post-democracy for quite a long time now and this country is only becoming *less and less* democratic has time goes on. 

People are shamed into participating in a political system that is fundamentally corrupt. People have become fixated on this illusory  notion of democracy, which takes precedence over any other kind of political act. It seems like the only way to have your say now is to vote and that if you don't vote you don't deserve to have a voice. 

What we need *is* a revolution, and it has to be a peaceful one. It is a spiritual revolution that's needed. People need to come to their senses and reject the political game that has always existed in this country. 

People voting 'tactically' are fucking the country just as hard by engaging and legitimising the political game. If you want to make a difference you will *never* do it through politics. Volunteer, spread information and knowledge, give to charity, be environmentally and socially conscious. 

People who reject the political system are laughed at by the people who don't understand that there's no genuinely good reason for things to be the way they are. They view the political game as an insurmountable pillar that can never be moved and has never been moved. Instead of focusing on how to create a reasonable socio-economic system and following through on it, people practise damage limitation because they just don't know any better.

1) That a population being treated as second class is the only motivation for violence

2) Loyalists wouldn't feel like they are being treated as second class

Firstly a population doesn't have be oppressed for it to turn towards violence. The Serbs in Bosnia spring to mind. When Bosnia declared independence many Serbs took up arms. They weren't being oppressed or having their human rights violated by the government, in fact the government was a coalition including the Serbs. Yet independence was enough to start the bloodiest war in Europe since WW2. Alternatively we can just look at the Troubles. The Protestant population weren't treated as second class, yet loyalists still committed sustained violence for over 30 years. 

And secondly even if they weren't treated as second class, will they believe that to be true?

I agree, and think she should really have contacted them whilst this was ongoing in order for them to stop.



But I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with contacting the police. I would imagine that her contacting the police went along the lines of ""x has been happening to me, is there anything you can do?"".



There are obviously times when this is a waste of police time, e.g. [that time a woman rang the police (999!) because she wanted more sprinkles on her ice cream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTqEThugdVk). But if it's potentially a matter for the police, as this behaviour was clearly intimidating her and was potentially harassment, then I don't see what's wrong with ringing them and asking. If it's not a matter for them to deal with I imagine they'll let you know pretty quickly - as it was they clearly decided it was worth their time. Even if she just wanted the employer to talk to their staff, I'm sure the police having a word with them made it a far more serious talk.",null,0,null,1430239415,null,0,false,0,cqrlfov,null,t3_344um7,null,t1_cqrlfov,null,t1_cqr9yw9,null,null,null,1432653938,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

The demographics are shifting, we all know that, but the wider implication of nationalists opting for the 'wait them out' strategy is that the unionist position is weakening by the day. If reunification were to happen tomorrow, yes there'd probably be a conflict of the size you're talking about. But it won't happen tomorrow, it'll happen when the demographics have shifted to the point a referendum can be won. 

That's not the only shift however, there's also the fact that unionism is becoming less extreme, that 'No Surrender' unionism shite is dying out. So unionism as a whole will be more able to accept defeat, and that process will be made easier for them because every attempt will be made, both by nationalists in the north, and by the south, to ensure that they are given equal treatment (and so give them no cause to opt for violence).

So who's left? Extreme loyalists. Their ideology isn't built on logic, so likelihood is that there'll be no reasoning with some of them. Thankfully, their numbers will be severely reduced by the demographic changes over the next few decades, and they'll have no support among the general population.

Politicians don't exist to enact progressive change, they exist to restrain it and block it as far as possible until they can't do it anymore. Old people are conservative as fuck and so both the conservatives and labour are fine for either of them, both being totally unprogressive and entirely conservative. 

The political game is constantly in flux and will change its form over and over again to keep this up. Progressive voters are teased with promises of 'change' if they just keep voting and that change never comes. We all think that if we just keep pushing that in fifty years everything will be different, or at least something will be different. This has *always* been the way it is in a democracy and nothing has changed. 

People expect politicians to be the agents of change, they aren't, they never have been. They exist as a bulwark for the status quo, for business as usual. Politicians just give us permission to change, they don't do anything to enact it. Instead of seeing these politicians and this political game as essential we should see them for what they really are, which is a total hindrance to real progress. They need to be thrown aside. Why do you think both the labour and conservative parties campaign almost purely on fear, on the basis that voting for the other will ruin the country. It's not to prove their use, it's to scare people into thinking that they're essential.

I do think you're overplaying this. There are some grey areas (I think relatively few really) where it's not clear whether the police need to be involved or not.

Then we would have more expensive tickets for bigger games - the 19 teams in the league are split into three categories based on how 'big' the game is, with top teams being most expensive. That's fair enough.

The reason this is so scandalous is that Hull are setting the tickets for away prices based on the opposition.

null,false,multijoy,eng-Surrey,Surrey,null,"Of course there is a difference *in the offence.* In terms of judicial treatment, they are dealt with the same; same burden of consent, same aggravating factors (age and so forth).

The crux of your argument, however, appears to be some concern that a woman cannot be called a rapist if she commits a s4 offence - causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.

Your claim appears to be that all those who cause a victim to undertake non-consensual sexual activity ought to be committing the act of rape.

I put it to you that the  injury and violation experienced by a male or female victim of rape (that is, a victim who has had their mouth, vagina or anus penetrated with a penis) is *different* to a male or female victim who has, without their consent, been caused to penetrate the anus or vagina (or in the case of a male victim, caused his penis to penetrate the mouth of another) with any part of their body. 

Put to one side the distress and psychic injury and look at the physical. Penetration is, just by the nature of things, bound to cause more injury to the orifice being penetrated than the the thing doing the penetration, and it's appropriate that this is recognised and it does the victims of either offence no favours to try and conflate non-consensual activity with the act of forced penetration. They are different acts. They are comparable (and the legislation recognises this) but not the same

All law is, to a greater or lesser extent, an attempt to categorise certain wrongs. You could easily construct the legislation (like burglary, with the theft act) to have a number of 'parts' to rape. S1 SOA rape could easily be S1(a) rape, s2 SOA assault by penetration could as easily be S1(b) rape and so on. But why? What purpose is that achieving?

There is some argument to suggest that rape and assault by penetration is a distinction too far, but that's legislation for you - the government of the day decided that this is how they wished to define it, and that's that. 

Regardless of the terminology, the current legislation in the UK ([Sexual Offences Act 2003](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/contents)) covers practically all possible permutations of non-consensual sexual activity in a reasonably clear and straightforward manner. The most serious offences (anything, basically, where penetration of any sort with any combination of body parts without consent occurs) carry a life sentence.

The people at the bottom have seen their relative income increase over the last 5 years and their total contribution to the income tax total decrease. Page 3 shows that those in the bottom ~40% are the only ones who's increases in income have exceeded inflation over the last 5 years.

TL DR: As a country we have gotten richer, poor people most of all. Poor people are paying less income tax than ever before, rich people are paying more tax than ever before.

If playing natural wingers was the key to beating a defensive team, why are they so rare at the clubs which have to play against a parked bus the most? 

Chelsea play with two inverted wide men constantly, Arsenal play with forwards or attacking midfielders who tend to drift inside, City use Navas frequently but in the past they've preferred two inverted attacking midfielders, Liverpool use creative attacking midfielders like Lallana or Coutinho or more forward players like Sterling, etc etc. 

I personally agree with AVB's philosophy in breaking down a low block. He spoke about provoking the opponent with the ball to entice players to leave position and create space. This is Guardiola's belief as well, and it's probably the most common way top clubs score against defensive teams. 

Top teams are getting their width from fullbacks. They aren't switching to natural wide players and slamming in crosses. They are patient with creative players.

If not all may not be lost. I'd argue the letter was confirming you intended to move onto a rolling contract. However, are there three previous similar letters? If so your argument may be weaker - by signing every six months it may indicate you are agreeing to six month extensions. 

Reminder for all - at the end of a fixed term tenancy the lease does not end. If nobody does anything the tenancy rolls on month by month (even if the contract does not say so the law implies it). The only reason to sign something is if you want more security from a new fixed term. 

The deposit point still stands - the landlord could be on the hook for compensation for trying to avoid the rules (up to twice the deposit amount). I would speak to Shelter.

null,false,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,null,"&gt; Yup, but that's a recent thing, in part caused by the shortage of DMUs thanks to manufacturers not keeping up with EU legislation/EU legislation being totally unrealistic (delete as appropriate).

Yes. I mentioned the new EU emissions regulations in a reply to another poster. Although there are provisions in the new Northern Rail franchise specification for a fleet of DMUs to replace things like Pacers, for example. I would expect to see cascaded DMUs from other operators eg ScotRail as they move services over to electric operation.

&gt; The routes I'm talking about are ones that have never been switched to DMUs in the first place!

Good point, most of our branch and regional lines did switch to MU operation.

&gt; Not that I'd say that's a bad thing at least from a passenger's point of view, but it goes to show that there is just as much investment lacking in European railways an anywhere else.

France is a particular example with the prioritising of the TGV network, although they are now investing in new regional and intercity trains too. As you say they are not the only example.

&gt; True, this does show in different areas of the railway, but we can't just claim that European railways are universally better than ours. I think we have to accept that there are strengths and weaknesses to every country's railways.

I would agree with that. I see people complaining about commuter services in London and the South East that IMO are leagues ahead of the trains up in the North of England &amp; North Wales that I use regularly.

Having travelled to France and Italy often, I do feel some of the ticket prices and the availability of true high speed rail does show where we are lacking.

At the moment though I would prefer our trains to be as efficient and punctual as the Swiss system, as things like HS2 are still a way off, although the question of capacity on main lines is never far away.",null,0,null,1430243186,null,0,false,0,cqrnwkx,null,t3_33li6n,null,t1_cqrnwkx,null,t1_cqqg9r0,null,null,null,1432655175,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

The British economy grew by 3.2 percent in 2014, which is really quite fantastic when you consider the pitiful state of most other EU countries, and it's  on track to grow by 2.6 percent in 2015 and 2.4 in 2016. One quarter of low growth isn't going to send Britain into another spiral of unemployment and recession. Look at the american economy, which in the Q1 of 2014 shrank by 2.2 percent. Was that the end of the world? Or the end of the economic upturn? Not according to statistics (http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth) which show american gdp growth in 2014 being at 2.4%.

The fact is with an upcoming election in which a populist left wing nationalistic party is expected to greatly benefit, and quasi-certainly, have a say in government, most investors are holding off until next quarter. Better to wait two months, until things are more secure, and keep your money elsewhere in the meantime, than squander your chance for a decent profit by putting all of your money into a soon to be anti-business country. Most predictions take this into account, and expect an uptick in the two quarters to compensate. Ans to be perfectly honest, I trust the predictions of experienced, quality economists, which tell me that the economy is growing rapidly, more than the words of a click baiting, deliberately biased journalist.

(If you look at this link from the economist, you'll see that Britain is,  according to predictions, going to be one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world this year and the next. http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth)

I know that this subreddit is quite left leaning, so I am going to say this: I'm not a super tory, pro-banker guy, and there are valid complaints to be made about the economy (wage stagnation, etcetera), but this really isn't one of them. And even though I'm ideologically split between libdem and conservative, I believe that left-wingers do have a point. It just seems a shame to discredit yourself by using invalid arguments when there is a plethora of perfectly good one at your disposition.

For the 'big 7' parties I would ask what makes you unable to agree with any of them? Must you agree with every policy that a party puts out before they get your vote, which in that case you may as well run independent or give up because that will never happen.

The parties exist because of likeminded individuals with an ulterior motive, Labour started because the 'working man' wanted fair representation in Government and latterly introduced the NHS, the SNP wanted Scotland's independence, the Greens want a more eco-friendly and socially liberal country, UKIP want our withdrawal from the EU.

Contrast that to last season where 3 of our signings cost £20M+ (Lovren, Lallana, Markovic).  

Obviously I'm not including inflation in that, if I did then maybe Mascherano, Johnson, Aquilani and Keane might be £20M+ but the fact is that there's no clear point that we just stopped signing talent or big ""marquee"" signings.

Do you honestly think the hills of Scotland are not hugely enjoyed as an escape and part of life by those living in cities?

Who has been stopped 'going anywhere, or carrying out anything meaningful'? The land Owners or the public?

If it's 'under the guise of preventing large scale wind farms or hydro projects' then what is the real intention?

Are you a landowner or stakeholder? If so, what use would you wish to see your land put to?

Although there are different definitions of what 'Wilderness' means, one of the primary aspects is  ""a tract or region uncultivated and uninhabited by human beings"" also; 'neglected' or 'abandoned'. I disagree that pristineness is necessary for one to feel in the wilds.

I appreciate that most of the Highlands of scotland suffers in its potential biological diversity and is in many places an ecological desert for many reasons. None of it remains untouched by man, however surely that doesn't mean it's not worth preserving the best bits?

I therefore had a choice between accepting an unpaid apprenticeship in a field that I enjoy (acquiring useful trade skills) or continuing to work in a dead end job that I hated.  There is no qualification provided, but their intent is to train me until I can become a full employee on salary.  I believe that this intention is genuine.

I have not yet signed an employment or apprenticeship contract, but I have signed a nondisclosure agreement which described my role as a 'voluntary apprenticeship'.

Because I value the skills that I'm being taught I'm reluctant to go the route of taking any action against my employer, as I know that it would almost certainly result in my return to a dead end job.

But he's not completely ignorant. He might get the detail wrong occasionally. But he's perfectly coherent in the themes he describes. And people can correct him on the detail, that's fine. People can disagree with him. But he's able to bring a degree to clarity to arguments some people perhaps feel on an instinctive level, but don't know how to articulate. And if he's a route for some of those people to look for a more nuanced, academic understanding of the subjects he discusses that's great. I believe that's probably what he's achieving.

&gt;No one else would get away with this. 

That's just not true. Our shamelessly partisan tabloid press just make up rubbish all the time.

And I don't mean to suggest that that's what Brand is doing by comparison. I think he's putting a lot of effort into talking with authority and being taken seriously. But he's new to this.

null,false,miomike,null,null,null,"Definitely. But also if too many start leaving then there'll be panic again because there's still no guarantee of managing to integrate the team like we did this season. We are one of the few examples (I can't think of any other off the top of my head, that's how rare it is) of rebuilding successfully immediately after being picked apart.  

Next summer, say we lose 5 players (just as examples) Schneiderlin, Clyne, Wanyama, Mané, Ward-Prowse. If we lost all those players I'd be worried again. We would not only not be able to keep hold of our stars, but also be selling off our young prospects... again. I have no doubt if that happened we'd draw in a lot of money - but that doesn't mean we'd get the same quality or integration we did this time. Even some of the players we've got in this window haven't been 100% hit, Tadic is more of a miss now and Gardos is still virtually unknown.  

I'm not saying I'm all doom and gloom, but there will definitely be interest in our players, and if we sell too many, good price or not, it is not a good thing, whether we have proven once we can replace them or not.

And before you ask, I'm a heterosexual man, so ""pretty boy"" wouldn't even apply as a reason.

Rambling Talk about Twelve and Eleven and Who below.

As someone said below,

&gt;grumpy old man who doesn't like humans

Which is an exaggeration, but it contains a kernel of truth. For those who says that's how he was originally, that's true, but that also means he's regressed. The Doctor has been warmer and warmer over time, so for him to get harsher feels like he's going backward for some.

Also, the 12th Doctor is colder and meaner than the previous Doctors, to some degree. There's a joy for adventure that Eleven, Ten, Nine, and even further back like Eight share that Twelve doesn't exude as easily (it's there to me, but it's hidden under a veneer of seriousness.) The Twelfth is the least likely to crack a joke, at least in public (even the First Doctor has his moments of humor and warmth.) 

Also, a lot of people thought that with the Time War behind him, the Doctor would be more carefree. Now, a lot of people say the 1000 years of Trenzalore made him darker...but that was all off-screen. It doesn't feel right, because we weren't ""shown, but told""--and told off-screen by Moffat at that. 

Also, the Doctor is a lot blunter this time around. He doesn't have time to waste on being nice, which can occasionally veer into rudeness. There's a certain lack of outward care given for the dying--which, although the Doctors could be that way before, Twelve can be seen as more so than them. The ""say a few words to the top layer"" is something that even Six or Four wouldn't have said. All the Doctors have had a certain sentimentality about the dying...except for maybe Four (I have to see more Four to really say). 

&gt;really don't see why people would prefer Matt Smith's Doctor over his

The Eleventh Doctor is whimsical. He is fun-loving, and enjoys hanging out with humans. He loves the small, happy things in life. He takes people om wonderful adventures, and misses them when they're gone. If his friends die on his watch, he cares so much he'll go into a depression. He is a bit of a dork, and sometimes feel like an old man trying to fit into a young body. He LOVES just enjoying the universe, and the people in it. To him, everyone is important. He acts human, although he's not. He can be terrifying to his enemies, and understands his place in the world as a protector of goodness. 

Basically, unlike Twelve, he shows the visceral display of a love of life typical of the Doctor, and he seems to outwardly enjoy it.

I can guess what you're going to say. ""Twelve is all of those things."" Ys, but he's much more subtle about, and if you're not careful, you'll miss it. There's a sense of fun and an enjoyment to be adveturing that many Doctors have, that Twelve doesn't really show except in snatches. He feels like a cynic sometimes, blasely going through the universe. Frankly, he's more introverted than other Doctors--which is why I've noticed introverts or people with bitter wit tend to identify with him (I'm curious--would you describe yourself as introverted?) . It's not that he doesn't feel emotion--but he doesn't show it easily; Twelve's more guarded. Thus, he seems grumpy. In the end, it's more stylistic which Doctor you like--Eleven is warm and cuddly (though has an dark edge), Twelve is more caustic (but he's blunt, and does care in his own way). 

The way Capaldi was scripted at first seemed a little wonky. Some people (I'm undecided) think that they went to far with being caustic with 12's lines at first. We need to see Series 9 to really judge it as a whole.

A lot of these disagreements boils down to the nature of how people think when they think who the Doctor is. That may seem simple, but after reading both the current blog posts and forum posts on the Doctor, plus peering at the 90s Who fandom's Usenet discussions, arguments, and flame wars about the Doctor (the Third Doctor fans vs Seventh Doctor fans flame wars of the 90s make even the worst argument here look like calm discussion in comparison), it's not so obvious. Is the Doctor the man who will always do the right thing, no matter what? Is he someone who never uses ends as justification of the means? Is he someone who does sometimes use ""ends as justification of the means"", but always feels bad whenever he does? Is he a hypocrite who uses his philosophy of ""non-violence"" as a smoke-screen for using companions to do his violent work? Or is his ""non-violence"" ideals proof that he always strives to be better, and do better, and gives us an ideal to strive for? Is he a rebel? Or is he just an officer who uses his ""rebel"" ideals to ignore his privilege?  Is he a hero of the universe? Or is he just an ""idiot in a box""? If he is so privileged, does he have the right to call himself ""an idiot in a box""? 

Errr..those were a lot of questions. The point is, how you answer those questions decides how you see the Doctor, and whether you see Twelve as the ""perfect"" Doctor. If you don't see why people would prefer Matt's Doctor, than you probably have a different idea of what ""the Doctor"" is. But it doesn't matter, because there's been so many Doctors, that there really is just no ""correct"" version of the Doctor.

**TL;DR**: I have no idea how to properly end this wall of text in a summary. Errr....don't be a rubbish robot from the dawn of time. They rust easily, and mess up the environment.

Most people do not incorporate straight away as if losses are made in the early years of trading they can be used much more efficiently than if trading through a company.

It is possible that you could trade as a partnership (which is effectively a few sole traders) and then share in the profits/losses. One of your friends being based in Singapore will make no difference to you.

If it's a serious endeavour and you'll be charging real money down the line I would recommend talking to an accountant to get set up.

&gt;If you are involved in a crash or stop to give assistance

&gt;use your hazard warning lights to warn other traffic
ask drivers to switch off their engines and stop smoking
arrange for the emergency services to be called immediately with full details of the incident location and any casualties (on a motorway, use the emergency telephone which allows easy location by the emergency services. If you use a mobile phone, first make sure you have identified your location from the marker posts on the side of the hard shoulder)
move uninjured people away from the vehicles to safety; on a motorway this should, if possible, be well away from the traffic, the hard shoulder and the central reservation
do not move injured people from their vehicles unless they are in immediate danger from fire or explosion
do not remove a motorcyclist’s helmet unless it is essential to do so
be prepared to give first aid
***stay at the scene until emergency services arrive. *** If you are involved in any other medical emergency on the motorway you should contact the emergency services in the same way.

Your lack of imagination is hardly a good enough reason to accept the shoddy state of the nation and the progress we are throwing away.

Right and left is cold war propaganda logic. There is no right and left, only what's good for the country and what's not, regardless of where that fits into the values of fearful xenophobics from the 50s.

On every subject, my opinions sit in a different point on the right to left spectrum. It's a false restriction on your thinking. The true best policies for a government is a matrix of every problem, every opportunity, and the specific, best option in each case. 

The trick we've all fallen for, is the same thing that marketers use to make you buy the middle product, when it's bracketed by a bargain option, and a premium option. It's a false middle ground. Centrist parties (Labour, Conservatives, Lib-dems) are not the only option, they've just convinced us that they are, they've convinced us the only game is the one they make the rules for (left vs right).

Reject them. think for yourself, think what's best in any given situation, not because it's what you want, but will be good for the people in this country. We need to stop thinking of it as a battle between left/right, or between big parties, and look at is as a collective struggle against the flaws in our own nature. All progress in history has been achieved by challenging the status Quo. Religion isn't dying as a result of everyone continuing to go to church. America didn't get independence by paying its taxes and asking politely. Forward progress means stepping on the toes of the people who will hold you back, the people who will rig the game so that, win or lose, things stay exactly the same.

Ask for better. Hold yourself, your representatives, and your fellow British residents to a higher standard. don't accept the lesser of some evils, don't accept the party that isn't quite so toxic as the other party. Ask for a different party that says, you know what, welfare and free markets can exist together in different contexts and different situations, and bring benefit in both. We can have multiculturalism and religious tolerance, while being a moral and harmonious society. We can allow free markets where it's safe to do so, and state-owned enterprise where it's not. We can take care of our poor, and reward the exceptional, without one having to cannibalise the other. We can cast out those who bend and break our laws, OUR LAWS, and we can build a better society for not having them, whatever pain we may or not feel in the short term. We can push forward progress in spite of the people who pull us back, instead of trying to do it on their terms. We don't have to be communists, or facists, or socialists, or conservatives. We can have it all, if we're honest, if we swallow our pride and put in the work. We should be making a better Britain for each other, not for ourselves. For our neighbours, for people who want to come here, for people who want to go, for the rich, for the poor, the people you know, and those you don't. Like george carlin said, if you have selfish, ignorant people, you will get selfish, ignorant politicians. They're not different to us, that's a cop-out. There no better, and no worse, because they are us.

People are saying that they aren't happy with any of the big parties, with the current system. Which of the major parties does this person vote for, when their interests are in direct conflict with the existence of said parties.

A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in. That's who we should strive to be, who we should strive to elect. And if nobody runs for these ideals, then let's send a message that they might. That they could. That they will.",null,0,null,1430248891,null,0,1430249950,0,cqrrncn,null,t3_344na6,null,t1_cqrrncn,null,t1_cqrlftu,null,null,null,1432656939,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

However i believe this is little more than a fantasy. There is an inevitable push towards the breakup of the entire United Kingdom and an eventual United Ireland, hard lessons have been learned, a united Ireland will only ever take place by a democratic vote by the majority here. 

I've posted on this issue before as seandalai has referenced, it's worth posting again here in full.

**What if i told you none of that (violence) would happen.**

And we already have an historical precedent, The Northern Irish State was brought into existence with the threat of looming violence from unionists as they had done previously over home rule, it confirmed the worst of possible fears for northern nationalists. 

&gt; The Unionist government ignored Edward Carson's warning in 1921 that alienating Catholics would make Northern Ireland inherently unstable. After the early 1920s, there were occasional incidents of sectarian unrest in Northern Ireland. These included the brief Northern campaign in the 1940s, and Border campaign between 1956 and 1962, which did not enjoy broad popular support among nationalists. In 1962, the IRA called off its campaign for the same lack of popular local support. Northern Ireland was relatively stable.^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles#1922.E2.80.931966)

Rather than heed these warnings the Unionist Government, set about creating a one party state with it's inherent discrimination in all aspects of daily life. rigging elections,denying housing, jobs and a fair opportunity on the basis of religion; ""a protestant state for a protestant people"". Yet the nationalist population did not rise up, it had the opportunity in the 1950's with the IRA border campaign, yet it failed to garner support.

Violence, as we know it is not and never has been fueled simply by national or ethnic identity; Violence is however inextricably linked to material conditions and quality of life, a pattern emerges from periodic violence it is always linked to the economy and the active participation in it.
 
&gt; After the Partition of Ireland in 1920, sporadic violence continued between the two communities. The violence was cyclic in nature and **often coincided with downturns in the local economy** (e.g., riots during the depression of the 1930s). Conversely, when the economy picked up, as it did in the post-war years, ethnic violence subsided; for example, during a peak of the economy in the 1950s, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was unable to launch a successful bid for secession due to apathy in the Catholic community (Darby 1976, 13). The pattern of separate settlements, school districts, and employment, however, continued as before ^[source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/landon.htm)

It took the Northern state 48 years to erupt in violence from it's inception. It was a one party gerrymandered state that habitually discriminated against it's minority. Even then there was no appetite among northern Nationalists for the IRA border campaign, which was abandoned in failure. A lesson could be learned there that national identity alone was not a catalyst for violence even when faced with such discrimination. The key change in all of this was demands for improvement in material conditions within the NI state, not a United Ireland, i.e Civil Rights. It is important to remember that these demands where not calling for a United Ireland but an end to discrimination in electoral representation, policing, employment and housing. It was the fact that the state reacted so violently to these reasonable demands that led to mass violence. 

None of these conditions will be met in the event of a United Ireland, firstly it will be a democratic process; namely not against the will of the people. There will be no intention to discriminate against the protestant population or deny them rights.In fact they would be more likely to be embraced and culture respected.

If there are protests no doubt they will be boisterous, possibly unwieldy they will however be carried out by a smaller number than you imagine; in reality the last big hurrah of [Unionist Mass protest](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/rally1.jpg) was in 1985, after the signing of the [Anglo Irish Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Agreement). Since then there has been a steady increase in cooperation between the British and Irish Governments, with even further participation and cooperation of the Irish Government in NI affairs. 

As for the Irish Army they have garnered an International reputation dealing in war torn regions and specialise in peace keeping missions, they would be more than capable in dealing with any resurgent paramilitary forces. Loyalist paramilitaries would never again receive the weapons, intelligence and Logistical support it enjoyed from the British Security Forces over the period of the [troubles](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2955941.stm). Most likely the British Army and security services would follow international protocol and accept the democratic wishes of the people and provided logistical support against Loyalist insurgents. Much like the Logistical support provide to Pro-Treaty Forces in the south in 1921.
 
&gt; By contrast, the Free State government managed to expand its forces dramatically after the start of the war. Michael Collins and his commanders were able to build up an army that was able to overwhelm their opponents in the field. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, armoured cars, machine guns, small arms, and ammunition were much help to pro-treaty forces. The National Army amounted to 14,000 men by August 1922, was 38,000 strong by the end of 1922, and by the end of the war had grown to 55,000 men and 3,500 officers, far in excess of what the Irish state would need to maintain in peacetime.^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Civil_War)",null,0,null,1430248938,null,0,false,0,cqrroig,null,t3_3453w7,null,t1_cqrroig,null,t3_3453w7,null,null,null,1432656954,null,12,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,12,null

My point, really, is that people tend to assume that democracy is something that has been a fundamental part of our society for a long enough time that it has become unquestionable and unchangeable. The reality is that, while democracy may have briefly been an incredibly powerful tool for society, we are now deep into a post-democratic period and there's a fair bit of evidence to suggest that this is the case, that the world is becoming *less*, not more democratic with time. My point, and what I'm calling for people to recognise, is that democracy was a great thing before the elite and the least progressive knew how to restrain it. Politicians have never been better at pandering to the people and putting on a show. 

So people think that it can't change, or even that it shouldn't because they don't seem what it's become. To them the very notion of democracy is infallible. Of course it has to change, and it has to change radically. 

Democracy should be about representation of the people. Now I'm going to leave aside propaganda and politicians pulling the wool over our eyes and bring up another important point. People complain about how the government is just an 'old boys club' and that's totally true, but the problem is much deeper than that, and it won't be solved just by having people from state schools in government. One huge problem is that if you want to gain any real influence in politics is that you have to suck upwards. Apart from a few exceptions (Caroline Lucas is the first that springs to mind... and even then I wouldn't call her influential at all), if you want to gain influence in politics you have to follow the status quo. The people who are unthreatening to the status quo rise to the top, and you don't stand a chance of possessing any influence if you hold onto your principles (unless you have principles that reflect the stupidity of what we currently have). So what we end up with are an endless stream of career politicians who know how to play the game, because if you don't play the game you won't have influence, and if you have any serious principles, you won't play the game. 

I went to a private school and I knew people who could *very* realistically hold serious positions of influence. They're dangerously clever people, tricky people, but they don't give a shit about others. The environment they grow up in is vicious and uncaring, and all they know is competition and prestige. 

The people that care about other people and actually would do a good job, not only can't get any serious influence, but are so alienated from the political system that they won't even try. That's why I suggest that if you want to be an influence on making the world a better place you start outside. We need to empower ourselves, to stop thinking that ticking a box every five years is good enough. Career politicians is all we'll ever have and that's the problem, it doesn't matter who you're voting for, the problem is the system and more specifically the political *culture*.",null,0,null,1430249094,null,0,false,0,cqrrs9p,null,t3_344na6,null,t1_cqrrs9p,null,t1_cqrpp2a,null,null,null,1432657004,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Yes, that is the way to go.

It really depends. If you feel that Green is ""almost okay"" then you can try to get the annoying bits dealt with. It is hard if it is fundamental. For example, I might believe that Nuclear power is a good thing to replace fossil fuels and supplement sustainable energy. Scientifically there is a very good argument, but this is against a key green policy.

&gt; In any case, it is not feasible for everyone to do that. 

That is true. To rise in a party, even sitting firmly in the background working on policies, strategies and so on takes a lot of time. However, we would be losing it if the only people who did are the ""professional political scientists"".

However there are also single issue lobby groups that can badger any party. This is another route.

3) balotelli is incapable of playing the one position we need him to, which is unfortunate. he drops deep and gets in cout's way, and rodgers tells him to push forward so he hugs the back line ready to make a run but nobody knows to play it through as he usually takes it to feet, back to goal. we might as well play lambert, at least hull have a slow defence and we have possession, so pace is not an issue. lambert will terrorise the penalty area in this sort of game.

4) ibe and sterling (have been told to) do exactly what babel used to do - run straight at the full-backs, but with the same amount of end product

5) individually, players are doing well, just balo and johnson making me tear off my fingernails watching them lack any sort of initiative or even simple ball-minded play.

We are stringing some great passing moves together and even though it's really congested we are managing to create chances. Ibe had a strong start but has tailed off a little, maybe see Markovic around the 70-minute mark.

Negatives: Balotelli is having a bit of a shocker. He's been loose with possession and played Dawson onside for the goal and is having trouble timing his runs. Decent chance with the backheel and it would have been glorious, but the chance at the end of the half there should really have had someone on the end of it. He has been equal parts unlucky and unimpressive. Can is having a mixed game, somewhat getting found out in defence but impressing going forward.

I think we need to see Coutinho as a false nine again, my first sub would be Balotelli off for Lallana, or alternatively put on Manquillo and move Can to midfield.

The British economy after the coalition

Martin Wolf

In what condition does the coalition government leave the UK economy? Needless to say, its members are fighting the general election on the proposition that they have done a fine job of rescuing the crisis-hit economy they inherited. It seems, at the moment, that this argument is not playing that well in the polls. Does it deserve to? Here is a scorecard.

Let us start with the simplest measure of overall economic performance. In the last quarter of 2014, UK real gross domestic product per head was 4.8 per cent higher than it had been in the second quarter of 2010 when the coalition took office, and 6.2 per cent above the trough of the “great recession” in the third quarters of 2009. But it was much the same as in the first quarter of 2007 and below its pre-crisis peak. In the fourth quarter of 2014, real GDP per head was close to 16 per cent below where it would have been if the 1955-2007 trend had continued. Even the recovery has not shrunk this gap. This largely explains the disappointment over living standards. (See charts.)

Moreover, this huge shortfall cannot be explained by a pre-crisis boom. On the contrary, the economy was close to its long-term trend in 2007. Booms had been far bigger in the early 1970s, late 1970s and late 1980s. Data on inflation tell much the same story. The argument that the UK economy was in a grossly unsustainable state in 2007 is largely ex-post rationalisation. Even house prices turn out not to have been unsustainably high. What nearly everybody missed was the vulnerability of the UK’s financial sector to a global crisis.

Jobs performance has been remarkable. In February 2015, 73 per cent of the population between the ages of 16 and 65 was in employment, slightly above the pre-crisis peak. Overall unemployment was 5.6 per cent of the labour force. According to Eurostat, 27 per cent of UK workers between the ages of 15 and 74 were in part-time employment last year. We do not know how far this reflects underemployment or voluntary part-time employment.

Yet the good employment performance is the mirror image of the collapse in growth of output per worker and output per hour: in November 2014, output per hour in the economy was 1.7 per cent lower than it had been in February 2008. Such a long period of stagnation appears unprecedented at least since the 19th century. Recently, the FT revealed that much of the explanation lies in professional services.

In the short run, stagnant productivity allowed the economy to combine weak expansion of overall output with decent jobs performance. In the long run, however, productivity determines standards of living. If the former stagnates, so will the latter. What is needed then is both fast productivity growth and fast employment growth. The necessary ingredient is buoyant demand.

Consider, now, the structure of the economy. In the fourth quarter of last year, manufacturing was 4.9 per cent smaller than at the pre-crisis peak, while services were 8.1 per cent bigger. The current account deficit grew to 5.5 per cent of GDP in the last quarter of last year. The rise was due to a large negative swing in net investment income. But, given a 21 per cent appreciation of JP Morgan’s measure of the real exchange rate between early 2009 and March 2015, the balance on trade in goods and services might also deteriorate further.

Turn to the public finances. Initially, the government talked as if the main challenge was the fiscal deficit, not the need to foster the nascent recovery. George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, set himself the objective of eliminating the structural current fiscal deficit by this financial year. In fact, the structural current deficit will be 2.1 per cent of GDP this financial year, down from 3.9 per cent of GDP in 2010-11, the coalition’s first year in office, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. Similarly, cyclically-adjusted net borrowing is forecast to be 3.7 per cent of GDP this year, down from 6.5 per cent in 2010-11. The coalition’s fiscal bite was less bad than its bark. The argument it offered for tightening faster than Labour had promised was that it was necessary to stop the UK from being hit by a crisis similar to those hitting countries such as Greece. We know now that this was wildly exaggerated for a country in the UK’s position. Despite failing to hit its fiscal targets, interest rates on UK public debt have remained astonishingly low: 30-year and 50-year gilts yield 2.4 per cent, while yields on comparable index-linked gilts are close to minus 1 per cent. Why should one be desperate to avoid a free loan? What is needed instead is growth-promoting borrowing.

In sum, the UK economy has enjoyed a weak, yet job-creating, recovery. Productivity growth has been dire. According to the International Monetary Fund, UK GDP per head at purchasing power parity was 72 per cent of US levels in 2014, behind Germany’s 84 per cent and even France’s 74 per cent. The claim by Mr Osborne that the UK might be the most prosperous major economy in the world by 2030 is fantasy. The risk, instead, is that it is going to fall further behind. Furthermore, the imbalances in the economy are going to make future growth more difficult and less sustainable. If the fiscal deficit were eliminated, while the current account deficit remained large, the private sector would have to run a large financial deficit. That is a frightening possibility.

The still bigger point, however, is that supply-side constraints now outweigh those of demand. We will never know whether a greater willingness to use the public sector balance sheet would have avoided that outcome. In the next parliament, however, the fundamental economic necessity is to find policies and programmes able to produce a better-balanced and more dynamic economy. These are the challenges against which the parties’ programmes must be measured — and will be found wanting.

null,false,pepe_le_shoe,null,null,null,"I will make 6 figures without any of the sacrifices you describe. It's telling you think of it this way. You're stuck on the notion that £1 is £1, and that £150,000 is such a huge amount of money now, like it once was.

You think people on minimum wage don't work hard? If working hard is the way we measure what people should earn, we'd all be fucking billionaire serfs.

I'm above the 89th percentile for income, and I won't be able to afford a mortgage before I'm 30, on a 1 bedroom flat, in the place I live and work, and I have no fucking choice. Compare that to the economy your parents bought a house in... compare it to the economy you *think* we now live in.

A 50% top rate doesn't mean taking half the money. You know full well how taxation works. You know that you pay the same 0%, 20%, 40% and 45% on the respective portions of your earnings that draw those rates as everyone else. You're no worse off for being taxed more heavily on the EXTRA money you have, over and above everyone else, paying the EXACT SAME RATE of tax on every pound of your income as everyone else.

You have more, you can give more. Don't be a selfish cretin and have some perspective, because one day, maybe it all falls through, and you need some help from anyone else, or your children, or theirs, or theirs. Think of someone besides yourself and your horrific struggle to earn over £150k, poor fucking you, how hard you have it. My fucking arse.

That guy you trotted out is talking about an entirely different set of issues. I'm talking about the rates of tax exacted, intentionally and rightfully, by the government. The scope of national legislation, or frequency thereof, is irrelevant, and the idea that the government is spending money in a way you don't like, therefore you should pay less tax, is laughable, and as I've stated elsewhere, people who think this way should be shown the rulebook and the door, and be made to choose one. It's a country, a society, a community, not a fight over who gets to take money off who else.  If you think you don't get to keep enough for yourself, then you logically think that nobody else does either, and we should scrap tax altogether and stuff our mattresses and see where end up. you're not in favour of paying less tax, you're in favour of paying tax when it suits you and think it's going where you think best, and when you disagree, you think you should be allowed to opt out, at the expense of others.

What matters is making people's lives comfortable, and pleasant and free. You don't need more money than other people have to achieve that, there's no market competition on happiness, much as you might wish there were. If you need 5% more of the income you get on top of your £150k to think your life is on the right track, I'd say forget the election, you have bigger issues, you'll be dead before you've got tax to the level that makes your life perfect, because it's not the fucking tax that's the problem, if you're dissatisfied, look elsewhere besides the pockets of the disabled, homeless and unfortunate.",null,0,null,1430251513,null,0,1430251874,0,cqrte72,null,t3_3450ua,null,t1_cqrte72,null,t1_cqrsa3i,null,null,null,1432657762,null,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

null,false,Mispla_cedUnderscore,eng-Bedfordshire,Bedfordshire,null,"Having read what you've written I honestly am more confused than I thought I would be, you've written a lot and I cannot make any sense of what you are trying to convey. You seem to suggest that we should all be striving for the best society possible, which we undoubtedly are, and that we should vote for the people who would best achieve that, we we do. Different parties exist because different people have a different view on what their 'utopia' is and/or how we should go about achieving it and since we are neither there or under a dictatorship we have multiple parties.

My point is that people complain about the existing parties not 'catering to my needs' but by and large why should they? They get a lot of people voting for them, admittedly the largest two do have an overhang of tribal voters, and there is a noticeable difference between all the parties. The choice you have goes; is there a party whom I largely/wholly agree with? No, is there one that shares the same core values that I believe in? No, then look to form a party that you and all these 'disenfranchised' people would clamour towards and that could reignite those who have lost faith.

When I say I cannot understand why someone couldn't relate to any of the 'big 7' (or really any established party) is because I'm asking what you are looking for in a political party (not for a direct response but as a question for thought), there's no value in saying that they ""are all shit and are a waste of time"" you have to look at why you feel this way and why none of the parties that exist correlate to your beliefs. The hard truth is that the reason these parties exist, especially the larger ones, is because there is a vast amount of people who agree with their principles and make that voice heard.

If you truly cannot find a party that you can at least agree with then you don't have much hope politically, if you disagree with the fabric of every party, big or small, then unfortunately unless you can find one to show support then you are part of the small percentage of people that they are never going to satisfy and ultimately will never bother to spend their time convincing you since you can't be convinced by any of them",null,0,null,1430251680,null,0,false,0,cqrti4s,null,t3_344na6,null,t1_cqrti4s,null,t1_cqrrncn,null,null,null,1432657813,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Alright, this wouldn't work for a couple reasons: 

1) Henderson and Lallana can't play as box to box midfielders when theres 4 players in front of them, and no one watching behind them. The offense gets crowded, and gives Hull an opportunity to just sit back, and it'd be very difficult to get Sterling space behind, and Coutinho and Lallana space in the pockets. Defensively this is very open to the counter attack.

2) Theres no real width on this team. When you're playing against relegation teams, they sit back. Best way to beat a deep lying back line is to quickly switch sides and exploit width. A narrow short passing line up wouldn't work.

3) Who's going to win the ball back? Neither Lallana and Henderson are great tacklers, and couldn't perform the Allen role. They're both great at pressing, but with so many men further forward, that press is going to be disjointed and easily played around. 

And yeah, it is fucking hard. Football tactics are very difficult. You've just put together a side that would be absolutely wank against hull for the reasons I've listed above, and we'd probably see an even more dismal offensive performance.

""Klopp is a mentor to his players, the kind of ""cool dad"" character who is half friend, half father figure. His passion inspires players to give everything for the club and to never, ever give up hope. He emphasizes that every game is important and that every goal is special: Rather than showing his team video footage of Barcelona's tiki-taka style of play, he instead uses still photos to illustrate how the Catalan giants celebrate every goal as though it were their first.""

""When his Mainz were promoted to the first division, he took the team for a five-day preseason camping trip at a lake in Sweden. The players were allowed to bring no food and did not even run for fitness training, let alone play with a football. But the experience built toughness and camaraderie.
""We went to the Bundesliga and people could not believe how strong we were,"" said Klopp, per Donald McRae of The Guardian.""

I just hate this idea that throwing money (someone else's money as well) is the cure to all problems. This country has a terrible attitude towards wealth and it needs to be adjusted. You justify punitive taxes on the rich by constantly demonising them. 

How about we start addressing root problems rather than just throwing money at them and calling anyone who doesn't want to participate 'greedy'.

The tax issue is a moral one. The state is never justified in taking away more than 50% and with NI that is going to happen under labour. I don't want to live in that sort of anti aspiration society.

Estate agents need to be really clear on what they charge you these days before you commit to applying to rent somewhere, so make sure you get a full breakdown of what each of you will be charged if you do want to go for the property.

The 'best' you speak of, are only the best according to definitions I don't subscribe to. Each party has policies I do and don't agree with, because everyone is obsessed with dividing up the principles, putting them somewhere on a 1-dimensional left/right scale, and fighting over which ones we get to the exclusion of the others. If the 'best' is a handful of people who will all do some things that are good and some that are bad, then what kind of shitty choice is that? There's too much of 'how I think things should be' over what will be best for the people, in politics.  

&gt; My point is that people complain about the existing parties not 'catering to my needs' but by and large why should they?

This is a circular argument. The national government is responsible for the country as a whole, their needs are our needs. Local government if for handling the specific varying cases of individual situations that might or might not be the same as elsewhere in the country, the national government has no need to get involved with such issues.

&gt; that we should all be striving for the best society possible

here, I think, is where the differences lie. Every one of the major parties has a prototypical british person, this prototype is not real, it's what they want a person to be. It's putting the cart before the horse, trying to plug a leak by telling water to behave differently. Near enough every party has ideas about the people who live in this country and what they should do in government 'for' those people, but the fact is, everyone is different, some slightly, some drastically. If you base your policies on families, or young people, or old people, or rich, or poor, you get flawed policies. People reject my thinking because a solution that's good for everyone is just wishful thinking. I disagree. I think we can do better. People like russell brand think so too, and despite not agreeing with him on many policy points, I agree with the notion that we need to ask different questions, think about things differently to how we do now, we need to ask more of ourselves, our communities, and our politicians, and we should be engaged with. All of us, fringe or dominant party supporters. We need to put our government in a position to attempt to make changes that improve things for everyone, and reject those who insist that benefits for some must come at the expense of others, even if the former group is much bigger - because that's what the current single ruling party convention achieves: benefits for their supporters, at the expense of those who aren't.",null,0,null,1430252734,null,0,1430252919,0,cqru7in,null,t3_344na6,null,t1_cqru7in,null,t1_cqrti4s,null,null,null,1432658146,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

null,false,Thapricorn,lfc-08-09-grey-kit,null,null,"I know tactics are difficult, and I can explain to you exactly why this would be better than what we're doing right now:

1) You're making the assumption that this is a symmetrical 4-2-2-2 formation. That's not the case. Sterling is better suited out wide trying to get onto the by line. Coutinho is better right behind the front 2 players. In all essence one of the strikers needs to drop off to the far post with one staying more central. Regardless, the point is that we need 2 in the box- what the fuck do you want Balotelli to do by himself against 3-4 defenders? The best he can do is just give a backpass and hope for the best as it was set up today. 

2) Width is provided with one of Coutinho and/or Sterling out wide while the other stays central- this shifts when we switch the ball to the other side

3) Switching the ball to the other side require the far-side fullback to push up. Can is not comfortable nor suited to play this duty as a right back, and Johnson as it is is on his weak side to receive a cross-field ball and take it down the line. Both of our fullbacks are out of position and not made for this. 

4) Why are you worried about winning the ball back so much? The entire point of this set up is that we should be holding possession far further up the pitch- as opposed to having 2 players wide in Ibe and Sterling, and then Balotelli, Coutinho, and Henderson stuck running like headless chickens to cover 5-6 of Hull's players. That's what's happening as we speak- we have 2-3 players attempting to press 5-6 of Hull's, meanwhile Allen sits back. The whole point is that we *shouldn't* be relying so much on winning the ball back as actually holding possession and pressing forward. The only thing we need to be careful of is a counter-attack, I'll admit that's the danger in this setup. Look at Barcelona or Madrid when they have Kroos, Modric, and James in- who is delegated to win the ball back? Nobody. It needs to be a concerted effort.


I guarantee you it wouldn't have been worse than what we have today- There is literally 1 player in the middle of the park between Hull's midfield and defense- the sole striker. Playing back and forth across the sides isn't going to break down disciplined defenses- what's happening today is exactly the reflection of that. No incisive passing means no goals. And we can't have incisive passing when we rely on *one* player to be both in between the lines as well as up forward.

null,false,pepe_le_shoe,null,null,null,"&gt;You're far more talented than me then because I did have to do all those things.

Here's the shitty part: I'm not. Money is not apportioned on the basis of who is most talented, or who works most hard. It's assigned, partially arbitrarily, and partially to those who already have the most. The labour market is not fair. It is rigged against all workers, even the ones who earn more than other workers. Wages are based on the money that your efforts will generate for someone else, that's all. Money doesn't determine is what you do is good, or right, it just determines that it will make someone else richer. I'm not saying everyone should be given exactly the same pay no matter what job they do, but we have to recognise that there's nothing inherent in a programmer vs a bricklayer, that means the former should have a more comfortable life, financially. 

&gt; I just hate this idea that throwing money (someone else's money as well)

You have this all wrong. It's not my money or your money. It's not somebody else's money. It's our money. Stop thinking in terms of me vs you, of rich vs poor. Would you give 50% of the extra money you earn, above £150k, to a relative or friend if they needed it, because times were tough, if they needed it to survive. 

Grow the scope of your compassion that you might be able to do such a great thing for someone who wasn't quite so close to you.

&gt;You justify punitive taxes on the rich by constantly demonising them.

I really don't. It's not their fault. The system gives them disproportionately large amounts of money, and they accept it, who wouldn't? But 250k vs 300k, what's that extra 50k getting you that the rest of us are missing out on? what can we look forward to? or is it the case that actually, you don't need it, nor do I, but a homeless guy could sure use 12 to get back on his feet.

&gt;How about we start addressing root problems rather than just throwing money at them and calling anyone who doesn't want to participate 'greedy'.

the root problem is that some siphon off too high a proportion of the money in the economy (I'm not saying it's malicious, but it happens), and that some can't get enough. Go ahead, address that problem without taking money from the rich. And remember, when you introduce QE, you devalue the currency of the rich, indirectly taking the money from them anyway. 

&gt;The state is never justified in taking away more than 50% 

why not? where does your money come from? It's a fucking hamster wheel, people will make wide-eyed aspirational claims that's it's not a zero-sum game, but it really really is. There's not an unlimited ceiling to how much you can get just for being special (you aren't), without it coming at the expense of someone else who's only crime was not being quite so special as you declare yourself to be.",null,0,null,1430253401,null,0,1430338930,0,cqrunsh,null,t3_3450ua,null,t1_cqrunsh,null,t1_cqrtuph,null,null,null,1432658370,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Just doesn't seem to think that Civil partnerships (which he is for) should be converted to Marriage. Which is a little silly, as IMO they're almost the same thing. 

Saying that, my own religious upbringing said that Marriage = Man + woman, for making babies. Which technically Gay couples can't do, ergo by that definition they can't marry. So I understand it's a possible definition, one that some good people believe strongly in for non-bigoted reasons. Key's probably going to be convincing the 'holdouts' that multiple definitions of marriage by different groups/lifestyles can co-exist equally without threatening or infringing on each other. Naturally we'll still have raw bigots, but I'm optimistic and think they'll be drowned out in the end.

LD put a [severe crimp in their plans](http://www.libdems.org.uk/snoopers-charter-dead-and-buried), yes. I want them to go further and indeed they are the ONLY party who has more than just a single bullet point about it. To quote:

&gt; We will:

&gt;*  Ensure judicial authorisation is required for the acquisition of communications data which might reveal journalists’ sources or other privileged communications, for any of the purposes allowed under RIPA; and allow journalists the opportunity to address the court before authorisation is granted, where this would not jeopardise the investigation.
  
&gt;*  Ensure proper oversight of the security services.

&gt;*  Establish in legislation that the police and intelligence agencies should not obtain data on UK residents from foreign governments that it would not be legal to obtain in the UK under UK law.

&gt;* Oppose the introduction of the so-called Snooper’s Charter. We blocked the draft Communications Data Bill and would do so again. Requiring companies to store a record of everyone’s internet activities for a year or to collect third-party communications data for non-business purposes is disproportionate and unacceptable, as is the blanket surveillance of our paper post.
    

&gt;* Set stricter limits on surveillance and consider carefully the outcomes of the reviews we initiated on surveillance legislation by the Royal United Services Institute and the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation David Anderson QC. We are opposed to the blanket collection of UK residents’ personal communications by the police or the intelligence agencies. Access to metadata, live content, or the stored content of personal communications must only take place without consent where there is reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or to prevent threats to life.
    

&gt;* Uphold the right of individuals, businesses and public bodies to use strong encryption to protect their privacy and security online.

This is also the point as which most people differ anyways, they see some policies as good (e.g NHS, welfare &amp; pensions) and others as bad (high tax rates, lack of house building or a lack of sovereign power) but many go hand in hand. If we want an all-purpose all-serving welfare system it has to be paid for, or if we want to attract business and investment the tax rates have to be inviting. This is why two different 'utopias' can be of equal good, some people want a large state that will provide everything to them regardless of circumstance and are willing to pay for it whilst others want a small state that provides the necessities and allows them to make a choice on what else they receive and then pay for it.

I'm not agreeing with what he's saying but it takes something like this to raise the mood a bit. We might get Europe, we might not but Luis Suarez is gone, Manchester United are back and by our own estimations, we're only slightly below where we said we should be. As a club we often pride ourselves on doing things the proper way - that's why we shouldn't be talking of sacking a manager in pursuit of instant gratification. It's what we all hoped for when FSG came into the club remember, patience and belief that we can restore ourselves and rebuild the right way after a tough few years.

It's taxed on withdrawal. So let's say you have £1.45m in the pot. 

The first £1.25m withdrawals will get taxed as usual. Anything above it will either be taxed an additional 25% if taken as income, or 55% if taken as a lump sum.

So the £200k will be subject to additional taxes:

* As income: 200k x 0.75 (25% tax) x 0.6 (40% tax - assuming higher rate taxpayer) = 90k net.

* As lump sum: 200k x 0.45 (55% tax) = 90k net.

Prior to the vote, the no campaign was pretty much running at full capacity and was extremely well funded compared to the yes campaign.

An average voter do not fully understand the difference between the two voting system except what media tells them (or doesn't). During the campaign, all they heard was ""Don't vote for ATV, it's bad"", without explaining why it's bad, etc. Only a minority of voters will know the difference between two.

null,false,TechJesus,null,null,null,"&gt; Well exactly, that would be a system that works! The system we have today is a system which benefits an elite few in order to drag the rest of us up with them as a consequence.
&gt; 
&gt; You are right, there is no ""perfect"" system. But surely there is a better one?

I don't believe we do have a system that benefits the elite whilst dragging up the rest of us. Sure, the government is cosier with the rich than the poor, but part of that is simple pragmatism: in an increasingly global economy you have to make nice with the wealthy to deliver the stuff people want (jobs, infrastructure and so on).

&gt; I think you have the wrong idea of voting, you think politicians have ideals and put themselves up for a vote and the public pick the one they like most - I think politicians look at the public mood and offer the ideals they think will get them the most votes. Thinking that voting drives change is totally wrong, people drive change and then vote for the politicians who embraced it.

The fact is that politics is both a matter of politicians attempting to position themselves to capture the most votes (see Tony Blair) and also leading when the public doesn't really know what it wants (see Margaret Thatcher, at least for the first election).

As for your reading of history, campaigning has only ever been a part of a complex process as to why countries take the roads they do. There are times when it does change things (US civil rights movement) and yet other times when it doesn't (anti-Iraq War marches). 

But I must confess I'm bemused by the logic of your posts. Are you upset that politicians pay attention to what the public think? That they react to what the voters want? That seems to me to be the antithesis of your first point: 

&gt; Besides, one of the main disadvantages of democratic government is that it enables the political class to block genuine change from ever occurring by making tiny gradual changes around the edges and convincing wishful thinkers that that is proof they will eventually one day change the system so that it works.

Vote reform is already starting to raise its head again.  If we'd got AV they'd have been able to push it back into the long grass by saying we'd have to give the new system a try, and it wouldn't have changed much at the end of the day.  Even Miliband has just mentioned about being worried about mandates if people don't vote, so if we can get people to vote for the smaller parties then even Miliband might be looking at MMPR in Scotland as his only chance to get Labour representation north of the border.

Mulit-member PR, that's the gold at the end of the rainbow.  Everybody still gets a constituency MP and we all still get a non-tactical PR vote to boot which compensates for FPTP.

As it stands I think the SNP are behind it, the Greens are in favour of a similar system, and UKIP are in favour of it.  I'm pretty sure the Lib Dems will still identify the merits.

Don't vote for Labour; don't vote Conservative, and the lower they both poll, whichever one wins, Multi-Member Proportional Representation is back on the cards.  If it's a minority government there's every chance it will pass as a Private Members Bill from opposition!

3-5-2 didn't work very well even with SAS. We relied heavily on counter attacks and the midfield was too light and overrun.

Don't get me wrong, Brand gave a poor interview there.





However, I think his conversational style actually protected him somewhat.

One quarter of low growth isn't going to send Britain into another spiral of unemployment and recession. Look at the american economy, which in the Q1 of 2014 shrank by 2.2 percent.

Not according to statistics (http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth) which show american gdp growth in 2014 being at 2.4%.
The fact is with an upcoming election in which a populist left wing nationalistic party is expected to greatly benefit, and quasi-certainly, have a say in government, most investors are holding off until next quarter. Better to wait two months, until things are more secure, and keep your money elsewhere in the meantime, than squander your chance for a decent profit by putting all of your money into a soon to be anti-business country. Most predictions take this into account, and expect an uptick in the two quarters to compensate. Ans to be perfectly honest, I trust the predictions of experienced, quality economists, which tell me that the economy is growing rapidly, more than the words of a click baiting, deliberately biased journalist.

Balotelli isn't told to stay between 3 defenders, he can make runs, decoy runs to make room for himself and his teammates and give his teammates more options. That's striker 101. He isn't doing it. Don't tell me that he's not that kind of striker, even Lambert does those all the time. Balotelli is only one fit enough for the striker position.

How many times does Ibe stop, start then run into a corner? How many times does Coutinho shoot from 30 yards? How many times does Henderson play the ball back into the middle?

It all comes from Balotelli unwillingness to move. 1) Sterling can't dip inside then play a quick 1-2 because Balotelli isn't in the box. 2) Ibe can't beat his man and cross/cut the ball back because Balo won't get across his defender or the front post. 3) Coutinho can't play any through balls because Balotelli won't run the channels 4) Henderson can't play his trademark diagonal ball (see Hendo to Studge vs Palace and/or Burnley) because Balotelli won't play on the defenders shoulder ",null,0,null,1430259048,null,0,1430297136,0,cqrya3x,null,t3_346mbi,null,t1_cqrya3x,null,t1_cqrvkqz,null,null,null,1432660076,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

That isn't down to enemy defences, but our incompetence at getting into great positions in the final third. You saw our last season when random shots from Sturridge saved us points while not even getting close to scoring a goal. Once Suárez came back into the team, he made so many great runs that our chances from Coutinho were finally utilised. Suárez also was double covered, which gave Sturridge loads of space he didn't and still doesn't know how to get into on his own. This is also the reason Agüero is so critical for city.

This problem sadly is one of the few that Rodgers can't seem to fix and it's been going on for ages. He needs his striker to already know how to position himself and we have no one with that ability.

A goal in our team should be set up in general like this:
Pass from CAM into space (forward had to make a run).
Wingers and CAM(s) have to make another run to open up possibilities for 1-2s or play it out to the wing (better if winger can cut in to get closer to others and the goal).
And last we need people to finish our chances.

Now we have great passers, finishers, but no one to make the run to link these up. Balotelli sort of does this, but he's not good enough at dribbling and he also doesn't run, like ever.

Sorry for the wall of text.

null,false,GoodBoyGoneRad,null,null,null,"But this is largely the same team that almost won the title last year? I understand losing Suarez and injuries have played a big part this season but there are quality players in there, he's not getting the best from them by playing them inconsistently and out of position. Last season you just knew the team sheet well in advance of the game, it was our strongest XI in the diamond formation, this season I would struggle to tell our best team or formation.  
We failed to replace Suarez properly and he has to take at least some of the blame for that too. I don't think our transfers are as bad as half this sub makes out, Can was a top signing, Moreno, Markovic and hopefully Lallana and Lovren will come good next season with a bit more experience and game time under their belts. But failing to replace Suarez properly, was catastrophic. We needed a similar style striker to fit into the system he'd developed, instead he signs completely styles of strikers in Lambert and Balotelli. We've had young players in Countinho, Sterling and Henderson to some extent developing and getting used to Suarez's style up front, the amount of times the team has got into positions to make a pass expecting Suarez to be there this season and have no one there and the ball go straight to a CB is ridiculous. I understand we were never going to get someone as good as Suarez but we should have got someone like him so it's not such a shock to the system and tactics we had in place.
 
I disagree though I think a lot of our problems this season relate back to him, we went on a good spell when he changed the formation, but that was half way through the season after struggling up until then, you've got to adapt quicker in the premier league, then when that formation started to fail he's persisted with it and we've been found out, who else do you blame for it? i can fully accept things don't work out the way you plan, that's football but you have to be able to adapt and change to suit the situation rather than be so arrogant as to assume it will come good (and you can't possibly be wrong) with time. I'd rather see Rodgers try tactics for 45 minutes and if it's not working, try something else and lose because it doesn't work and LEARN THAT LESSON, that consistently fail. Look at Mourinho, he is the top manager in the league, he's shown that, and he'll adapt his team week on week based on players available and what works. Take the Arsenal game, he didn't need to win, just avoid defeat, so that's how he set his team up. It was boring (and yes the quality of players he had available plays a big part) but it worked. 

I don't know this is just my opinion, but I think Rodgers has been found out this season, and with it getting harder and harder to reach the top 4, we can't persist with someone who is still developing as a manager, we don't have time. I hate how football has changed, 20 years ago we could have given Rodger 2 more seasons and probably seen success, but 2 seasons at this level now, see's us fall so far behind we won't catch up.

Appeals are a very complex process, in which it is far harder to represent yourself than first-instance cases. Since it sounds like the judge has made a simple finding of fact (that there is no risk of harm to the children), it may be very difficult indeed to challenge the point on appeal. Without analysing the case in full, it is difficult to suggest any realistic avenue to a successful appeal in these circumstances.

Litigants-in-person very frequently find it very difficult to keep in mind that appeals are on the law only. You CANNOT just say that the judge below was wrong because they made incorrect findings of fact. You must show that they made a legal mistake- and it is difficult without being a specialist to find such a mistake, and persuade judges that said mistake has been made.

My strongest recommendation to you is to find some way of securing representation. If you absolutely cannot afford a lawyer, and are ineligible for legal aid, try any pro-bono unit that will help you. 

If you try and appeal on your own, you may very likely fail because of the way you argue your case- even if you could have won had you argued it differently.

null,false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,null,"It's because we already have an incredibly bad time trying to break through teams who are putting men behind the ball. And then if we give a soft goal away, it's basically game over because there's even less incentive for them to risk putting bodies forward. 

Take the game today - very little came off trying to get through the middle, and we weren't sharp enough to get the ball in behind down the flanks (and then on the two or three occasions we did the cross in was poor). We basically just limit ourselves to shots from outside the box or trying to do a neat flick through a gap filled by three defensive players. Once Hull got a goal, it just got even worse, because as the minutes counted down they were prepared to just sit deeper and deeper behind the ball and we just had no ideas for how to get through.

Last year we had Suarez to cause havoc in defences and dribble his way through teams trying to set up behind the ball at the back. He'd either get through and create a chance, win a penalty, or generally cause enough upset in their back lines to create space elsewhere for players like Sturridge. When he's got both their centre-backs and their DM shitting themselves about being nutmegged it's a lot easier for other players to make movement. 

This season we don't have that. If Coutinho can't pull off some magical little flick, or we can't get a quick counter from when our opposition have put bodies forward, then we're basically fucked. Look at the number of games this season where we've won from going a goal up from a long range shot from the likes of Coutinho or Henderson. Tactically Brendan just doesn't seem to have this team able to collectively break open defensive setups, and as a top team you've got to be able to do that because plenty of sides will set up shop against you and happily play for a draw.
