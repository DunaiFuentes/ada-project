Speaking both as a car driver and a cyclist. There are far too many roads with dangerous pot holes. If I'm in my car I try to avoid them so I don't damage my suspension or steering. If I'm on my bike I try to avoid them so I don't wreck.

Issue is, it's not safe to have roads where cyclists have to come out of the cycle lane to avoid holes. On the same roads cars go into cycle lanes to do the same.


It's an absolute joke, they are willing to spend the money to put up new signs throughout the whole city. However, can't even fix the problems they already have.


Even the holes they tried to fix on Gorgie road have been done so badly they still cause problems.

&gt;Terrorists Among Us: Jihad in America is a amateur film by counter-terrorism hobbyist Steven Emerson.

After that it's a case of right opinion in the right place at the right time. The early 90s were just after the Cold War ended and American TV makers were very much in the market for new politics of fear stuff, hence a TV company putting out what was basically an amateur film. And he did discover radicalisation years before it became a mainstream discussion point.

However calling him an expert seems a stretch. He investigated and reported on a very specific phenomenon, the spread of radical literature among young American Arabs. 

He's clearly managed the impetus from being a ""muslims are being radicalised"" early adopter phenomenally well, now heading up his own think tank on terrorism.

But he only sees terrorism through a single lens. After the Omaha bombing he said 
&gt; Emerson said, in what a The Boston Globe article termed a ""shrill prediction"", that it bore the ""trait"" of ""Middle Eastern terrorists"" because it ""tried to kill as many as possible.""

So what he's really expert in is crying wolf about muslim terrorists and had the career good fortune to be warning people about Muslim terror before during and after the Twin Towers.

Basically he's a stopped clock.

Purely defensively speaking, he's better than Lovren, Moreno, Manquillo and Toure. Can has made an impressive interim defender but he's still a midfielder, so at the end of the day the only comparison left is Sakho.

Sakho's only defensive strengths over Skrtel are winning balls in the air (thought Skrtel is better offensively in that regard) and also pass completion percentages. 

Skrtel to me is better at every other defensive category because he's a more intelligent player of the game at the end of the day. His general positioning and knowing when to commit to his man or pulling back . He's better at last minute decisions with his block tackles of shots (sticking his leg out, body blocks, etc). Also slightly better at coming out to the midfield for crucial stoppages of opposition attacks when Gerrard and Lucas are beat in defense. He's less prone to getting beat in 1v1 situations as well. In the Sunderland game, the awkward Adam Johnson shot that rebounded off the bar was perfectly dealt with by Skrtel when the Sunderland attacker was initially in a better position to shoot it.

This probably all comes down to Skrtel's age. He has years of experience over Sakho who is still very young, and generally speaking defenders usually take longer than other positions to mature in their game understanding.

On a side note: When it comes to game understanding and positional/tactical awareness Lucas is by far one of our most intelligent players.

null,false,collinsl02,null,null,null,"Wifi, because of the fact that it's a broadcasted radio signal, is heavily subject to interference. This can be from a number of sources, including (but not limited to) microwaves, cordless phones, walls, floors, ceilings, and other wifi signals in your immediate area (next door houses mainly, maybe 2 houses down in either direction if they're close together like a terrace).

The important things to note here are:

1. Don't put your router or receiving device (phone, laptop etc) near a microwave or a cordless phone.

1. If your house has solid (brick, stone as opposed to plasterboard) or metal-lined walls, you're SOL without a wifi range extender or signal booster when you're a room or two away from the router.

1. Most wifi signals use the 2.4GHz radio band to operate, but this is subdivided into a number of smaller-width frequencies (have a look at the diagram [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels) for more info) - there are nominally 14 of these channels, but because of local laws not all of them are accessible everywhere, and because of how close together these signals are, there are only really 4 usable channels - 1, 6, 11, and 14 (if your router has 14).

Essentially channels 2 and 3 overlap with channel 1 (and would interfere with any signal on it), channels 4 and 5 overlap with channel 6, etc etc.

And of course, because there are only this limited number of channels to choose from, wifi signals from other routers in your area will interfere with your own if they are on the same or an overlapping channel, and the odds are that there is at least one which is on each channel.

There are three options here open to you (that I can see):

1. Put up with it (sorry)
1. Run Ethernet cables around your house and plug in your laptop/games consoles etc - Ethernet doesn't suffer from the same interference. 
1. Buy a new router/wireless access point that uses the 5GHz wifi band - this is becoming more heavily used, but right now it's less congested than the 2.4GHz band is - it's also got a shorter range so fewer signals from your neighbours will interfere with it. The wifi type you are looking for here is ""Wireless AC"" or ""Wireless N 5GHz"" (note that Wireless N comes in both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, make sure you get the right one)",null,0,null,1421224341,null,0,false,0,cnoiu0y,null,t3_2sbpdn,null,t1_cnoiu0y,null,t1_cno4atv,null,null,null,1424884801,null,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2,null

Here's the [full report](http://antisemitism.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Annual-Antisemitism-Barometer-Report.pdf).
It appears to be the first and only ""Annual Antisemitism Barometer"", probably because the Campaign Against Antisemitism themselves appear to have been created fairly recently. Their facebook page goes back to 1st August last year, their Twitter feed to 6th August 2014 and their [website] (http://antisemitism.uk) was registered on [6th November 2014](http://www.nominet.org.uk/whois/lookup?query=antisemitism.uk).

They're aren't currently a charity (according to the [Charity Commission](http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/registerhomepage.aspx)) and appear to be funded by direct donations.

As far as the content of the report goes I haven't made my mind up yet, although my main misgiving is that although it's a YouGov poll and has been weighted for statistical significance I tend to question general conclusions drawn from limited evidence, the limited evidence in this case being a survey size of 3,411 adults out of a population of about 48 million.",null,0,null,1421224723,null,0,false,0,cnoix60,null,t3_2sdksr,null,t1_cnoix60,null,t3_2sdksr,null,null,null,1424884761,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

&gt; look over your shoulders before you move off - every time. Even though you're not on the road, you WILL get minors for not doing this, although I don't think they can fail you for it.

They can rack up enough to fail you, although if you forget to do it before the U-turn, you *will* fail. It's the one place it's pretty much mandatory.

&gt; Slalom &amp; Figure of 8

Also, don't worry about being precise. What they're looking for is smooth clutch and throttle control, as well as balance. And if balance is an issue, you can shift your weight on your seat to help that out. Just slightly scoot your bum over as you're about to turn.  
Bigger loops on the figure 8 are easier to control too.

&gt; Slow Ride

You can use the back brake lightly to help slow you down too, and it'll help maintain balance. [Not sure if that's what you're meaning by covering the back brake, to be honest]

&gt; U-turn

As said, you *must* do your lifesaver here, including a good check behind you.  
You can, if you wish, from the start box, look round and move to the edge of the line at the side. Then stop. Then do your full look behind and go.  
Don't go into the turn too soon - make sure you've got your balance - but if you leave it too long, you *need* to do another shoulder check. Too long is about over a second from starting to move.

&gt; Emergency stop

If you just put your foot on the back brake, the shifting weight from you slowing down via the front brake can be enough to apply the needed pressure.  
Squeeze that front brake. And don't stop increasing the pressure until you've stopped.  
Don't worry about the clutch. By all means bring it in at the very end, but you won't fail if you stall the bike. As long as you keep your balance.

&gt; Swerve

An inc (distribution) share takes any gains and pays them out in cash. So if you invest £1,000 and it makes £50 over the first year, you will now have £1,000-worth of that fund and £50 cash.

that's complete BS.  Almost every economist of note has made it clear that in recession you should spend, not tighten the belt.  We would have much better growth without austerity (then tackle debt when economy moving).

I think you need a bit of a reset on your expectations. 19% isn't 'not so bad', it's fantastic. Like, unsustainably fantastic. In 2012 and 2013 especially, we all made out like bandits, because the market was rebounding from the crisis. Unfortunately it can't rebound forever, which is why the FTSE 100 closed 2014 down 2%.

**Past performance is not a guide to future performance.** People wave that off like it's nothing, but it is 100% true. How that fund did in 2012 is less than immaterial to how it will perform in 2015.

Feel free to base your investment decisions on your ethical stance, but don't do it based on how the fund has done over the past three years.

Put it this way: one of my best-performing investments in recent years has been the Schroder UK Dynamic Smaller Companies fund (formerly Cazenove UK Smaller Companies). It did some mad things coming out of the recession - it was up 35% in 2012 and 43% in 2013.

Reddit is by far and large liberal leaning, so that is why the DUP are so disliked here and why some of Sinn Feins policies are celebrated. If the policy roles were reversed then you would be certain that the sub would revile the relevant party. The DUP and loyalists have also had a serious amount of negative press this past while so that isn't really the subs fault.

&gt;The DUP are the worst people on earth on here and you will be exiled if you mention that Sinn Fein isn't the perfect party

Absolute nonsense. People here are incredibly aware of the past of notable Sinn Fein members, and when it is brought up as a thread topic is is discussed similarly to anything else. The problem is when you have the topic of something else and then Sinn Fein/Republicans are brought up with statements like ""Ah but sure these one's did worse back then!"" whataboutery that the sub takes disliking to.

There are several members known for their constant whataboutery who are consistently downvoted when they do it. Just as there are Uber-nationalist members that are similarly downvoted for posting ridiculous views.

&gt;Don't get me started on the word loyalism it may as well be a banned word here. 

Again, this isn't a Nat vs Loyalist issue here. Moderates like myself despise what a particular sect of that community stand for and their hypocritical positions.

I don't think you understand what equality is. Views are welcome to be shared, but people don't have to respect/like them. Unionism/Loyalism and Nationalism/Republicanism are political viewpoints, not a birthright.

This website isn't a public service rejecting your input because of your political view.

From the 1970 Labour manifesto:

&gt; In the world as it is today, Britain must maintain her defences and her firm commitment to NATO. It is true - and it is a truly Socialist shift in priorities - that we now spend more on education than on defence, and that in the near future the health and welfare service expenditure will also exceed defence spending. Yet, because of our shrewd and sensible reduction in commitments, with Labour, the armed forces are better paid, better equipped and more effective in NATO than ever before. More than that, in contrast to the hundreds of millions of pounds wasted on costly prestige projects under the Tories, Labour's defence planning gives the taxpayer value for money.

&gt; Labour is determined that NATO shall not be merely a defensive alliance: it must work positively for a relaxation of tension and reduction of forces. Some progress is already being made. Herr Willy Brandt, Socialist Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, is engaged in talks with Russia, Poland and East Germany. The British Labour Government fully supports his efforts. Our Government, together with America, France and Russia, is seeking to reduce the occasions for conflict and tension in Berlin.

&gt; The Government believes that the members of NATO should work towards a well-prepared conference on European Security, in which balanced reduction of forces and the key problems now creating tension in Europe could be discussed. The Government has just taken a new initiative for multilateral explanatory talks with the Warsaw Pact countries with a view to finding a basis for wide-ranging negotiations on European security and a relaxation of tension.


Here's from the 1974 Labour manifesto:

&gt; The Labour Government will maintain its support for NATO as an instrument of détente, no less than of defence. The ultimate objective of the movement towards a satisfactory relationship in Europe must be the mutual and concurrent phasing out of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The Government will continue to work for the success of détente by playing an active role in the multilateral disarmament negotiations now taking place in Vienna and will back this diplomacy by improving bilateral relations with the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe up to the limit that the situation in each case allows.

Here's from the 1979 Labour manifesto:

&gt;  We shall also give every encouragement to our American allies to achieve a successful conclusion to the vital Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. The Labour Government will maintain its support for Nato as an instrument of détente no less than of defence. The ultimate objective of a satisfactory relationship in Europe is the mutual and concurrent phasing-out of both Nato and the Warsaw Pact.

1983:

&gt; Labour believes in collective security. The next Labour government will maintain its support for NATO, as an instrument of détente no less than of defence. We wish to see NATO itself develop a non-nuclear strategy. We will work towards the establishment of a new security system in Europe based on mutual trust and confidence, and knowledge of the objectives and capabilities of all sides. The ultimate objective of a satisfactory relationship in Europe is the mutual and concurrent phasing out of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

&gt; We oppose any attempt to expand the role of the alliance into other continents. We condemn the doctrine that nuclear war can be limited, and the notion that somehow the West must catch up with a supposed nuclear superiority in the East. We are opposed to the introduction into Europe of any new nuclear systems such as the neutron bomb. We oppose, too, the storage, research and production of chemical and biological weapons, and call for the withdrawal of all forward stocks of chemical weapons.

From the 1987 manifesto, where this occurs right in the introduction:

&gt; This election will decide whether we put our resources into the real defence provided by a modern, well-equipped army, navy and airforce safeguarding our country an d supporting NATO; or spend those sums on maintaining an ageing system of nuclear weapons, while buying a new generation of missiles which cannot give our country effective defence. It will decide whether Britain is part of the international process of nuclear build down or ruled by a government uniquely intent upon nuclear build-up.

And further in:

&gt; Labour's defence policy is based squarely and firmly on Britain's membership of NATO. We are determined to make the most useful possible contribution to the alliance. We can best do that by concentrating our resources on the non-nuclear needs of our army, navy and air force.

&gt; The Polaris system of nuclear delivery is ageing and will soon be obsolete. The Tories are buying the expensive American Trident system - a policy which increases nuclear armament without increasing security and, at the same time, diminishes our effective defences. Trident's cost of up to £10 billion will take up so much of our defence budget as to deny modern and necessary equipment to our front line forces. Indeed, this process is already happening.

&gt; Labour rejects this dishonest and expensive policy. We say that it is time to end the nuclear pretence and to ensure a rational conventional defence policy for Britain.

&gt; So Labour will decommission the obsolescent Polaris system. We will cancel Trident and use the money saved to pay for those improvements for our army, navy and airforce which are vital for the defence of our country and to fulfil our role in NATO. We will maintain a 50-frigate and destroyer navy. We will play a full part in the development of the European Fighter Aircraft. We will invest in the best up-to-date equipment for the British Army of the Rhine.

You have utterly failed to do that then.

&amp;gt; I'm not the one arguing that...

You're saying that as if that means something. I'm arguing that any discrimination suffered by Jews is insufficient to arouse feelings of having no future in the UK. You are arguing that the discrimination suffered by Jews is equivalent in scope and magnitude to that suffered by blacks and Asians and therefore the attitudes cited in this report are legitimate as a result.

But then again, you're not even doing that much - all you have here so far is a feeble ""you didn't show me any proof that blacks are discriminated against therefore stuff"".

&amp;gt; And yet you did by only identifying racism/discrimination against other groups.

Your big argument is that by failing to mention the discrimination suffered by British Jews that has already been highlighted in the article that post directly referring to, I'm what?

It makes for mixed reading. 

First of all, as regards this question, this reports finds 77% of British Jews haven't considered leaving the UK (figure 21). 

There are some very worrying findings: 

*  Only 5% of respondents said antisemitism wasn't a problem in the UK (figure 5). 

*  68% said anti-Semitism has increased in the past 5 years (figure 6). 

*  I was astonished to read that 46% of respondents said they'd heard non-Jews say the Holocaust was a myth or exaggerated (figure 13). 

*  Teenagers are the second most likely perpetrators of anti-Semitic harassment/violence (figure 17). Even accounting for the fact that teenagers are arseholes, THAT is depressing...

* Younger Jews are more likely to face anti-Semitism (figure 26).

However there is some cause for optimism:

*  The vast majority of UK Jews said they have never felt so unsafe as to avoid Jewish areas or events (figure 20). 

* The vast majority of UK Jews feel they are treated the same as everyone else by doctors, the courts, the police and landlords/letting agents (figure 24). 

* The UK polls best (or joint best) amongst European Jews for anti-Semitism, fears of anti-Semitism and anxiety ""displaying things that indicate Jewishness"" (figure 31).

Finally, some interesting things that stuck out to me:

* Israel remains a sticky issue. While very few would say criticising Israel is necessarily anti-Semitic, particular forms of criticism are dealt with with more suspicion than others (pages 16-17). 

* UK Jews are twice as likely to face anti-Semitic attacks/harassment from a political left-winger than right-winger (figure 17). Extremist Muslims, predictably, top that list. 

* The more religious you are, the more you consider anti-Semitism a problem across the board (figure 25). 

* Female Jews are more likely to find anti-Semitism a problem and think it is on the rise. However, they are less likely to actual face anti-Semitism. On the whole, more than 3x as many female Jews think anti-Semitism is a problem than actually face it. Similarly, almost 2x as many male Jews think anti-Semitism is a problem than actually face it. All this was figure 27.

...food for thought! Personally, I'm proud that we have Europe's second largest Jewish population and I think the UK would be much worse off without them. Therefore, I hope attitudes towards Jews can improve.

'So the UK government did a lot of austerity, then stopped doing more, and the economy began to grow thereafter. Does this vindicate expansionary austerity? To use an analogy I’ve used before, if I keep hitting myself in the head with a baseball bat, and then I stop, I will start to feel better; this doesn’t mean that hitting yourself in the head with a baseball bat is a good thing'

null,false,hotcod,null,null,null,"There are given points in the article that I agree with but they are mostly things taken from or said better else where while the majority of it hyperbolic and sits firmly on the wrong side of the line. 

For example this article from [The Guardian]  (http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/08/guardian-view-charlie-hebdo-show-solidarity-own-voice) about why they didn't reprint the cartoons.

&gt;That case is straightforward. Since these are the images the gunmen wanted to stop, the surviving free press is obliged to deny the killers that victory. No other gesture can show that we refuse to be cowed by their crime. By repeating Charlie Hebdo’s action, we would demonstrate our resistance to the edict the terrorists sought to enforce on pain of death. We show that Charlie Hebdo was not alone.

&gt;There is an appealing simplicity to that stance, but it rests on faulty logic. The key point is this: support for a magazine’s inalienable right to make its own editorial judgments does not commit you to echo or amplify those judgments. Put another way, defending the right of someone to say whatever they like does not oblige you to repeat their words.

Not only is that increasingly more nuanced and thoughtful take on what I think is the route of what Hasan was trying to say it shows an understanding of where the issue stems from rather than attempting to use it to set up a total strawman of what most people understand free speech to be. Which is to say that free speech is *inherently* not the freedom from consequence, you would see most people here point that out in relation to the whole dapper laughs thing... guy was free to make any 'comedy' he liked but people didn't have to not express *their* opinions that it was misogynistic bullshit and ITV was free not to fund it after that feed back.   

The issue here is that there is an important point to be made about how we shouldn't let this polarise us. Reposting the the cartoons for the sake of reposting them we run the risk of that act of defiance becoming or being mistaken for endorsement. I found them to be low effort shit relying on offense in place of having much, if anything, to say... I would then defend the right for them to do that freely but I wouldn't repost them or make statements of endorsement for them editorially. 

Hasan sadly falls into that same trap from the other side and ends up just adding to the problem I think he was trying to address than having anything actual constructive to say.

I say fair play to them for coming up with an idea and wanting a way of making their feelings known - but this isn't the right way to go about it in my opinion. 

If people did join in en masse (which I don't think they will), then it's going to affect the players, not the board. It creates a bit of an 'us vs them' atmosphere, and the players I think are more isolated from the fans than they ever have been in the last few years. Fans not turning up, booing bad passes, moaning about them drinking on the coach at the end of the season and getting their party cancelled. There doesn't seem much reciprocal 'love' in the air right now. 

We've got a player making his debut, a keeper who will be walking up to the Holte End and an opposition who will have very loud and vocal support right from the off. We need to generate a positive atmosphere from the kick-off, not the opposite. The open letter to the Holte End should have been 'we're all in this together, let's support the team as much as possible for 90 minutes and help inspire them out of this bad run of form'. 

And in truth, the Holte End has been half empty for the past couple of games anyway, so I'm not sure anyone looking on will really notice much difference. 

Protest, sure. Something has to change, but there are better ways to do it. We're in a relegation scrap and we need to be united between fans and team to try and make Villa Park an intimidating place to come for away teams again.

We need,

1 Striker: Excellent finisher, fast, agile, capable of dropping deep to collect the ball and link up with play, as well as holding it up. For the system to work well it needs a 20 goal a season striker. Because due to being made of glass, Sturridge should be Plan B.

1 Goalkeeper: A world class goalkeeper can mean the difference between fourth and first. We need a confident, strong, sexy wo-...collector of the ball, who is also good with his feet. First and foremost his defenders need to trust him.

1 Midfielder: The ""Gerrard Replacement"" is a nonstarter. But what we do need is a dynamic, aggressive, technical presence in the midfield. An all round midfielder. Someone equally gifted in both pinging passes, and kicking asses.

1 Centreback: We are a shambles in defence. We need a leader. Someone that will lead us to hell and back. He doesn't need to be silky on the ball. He needs to be a hard cunt that would rather watch you fuck his Mum than concede a goal. Right now we have no top defenders. ""SAKHO!"" I hear you scream. And I want to listen, but the evidence is against him. He's always got one big mistake in him, and top defenders are supposed to instil confidence. I think he wood do brilliantly if partnered with a Carragher type, but there's nobody like that at the club. Lovren, Lovren, Lovren... *ruffles his hair*  He was going to be great, wasn't he?

We have less debt than Italy but we have a bigger budget deficit. Italy if you exclude interest payments on their debt actually have a surplus. We don't have a primary account surplus.

We also don't know if it has stopped. We live in a country where clearly 25 years ago there was an institutional culture of molesting children across many of our great institutions - the BBC, Westminster, perhaps even the Royal Family. What has changed that would stop that happening today? Probably nothing.

We can all agree he's not Eriksen levels, but I think he would be a competent backup. From what I remember of his game time for us, he could a pick a through ball very nicely, had a decent shot on him and of course could run round the pitch like a manic terrier. 

His main problem seemed to be that he could try to press too much and end up making hasty tackles. But surely with some good coaching this could be corrected?

Could it be that the club just decided to take a good offer to give a promising young player lots of game time? We obviously wouldn't have had these kinds of offers for our other midfielders such as Paulinho and Dembele who the club will have wanted to try and return some of their considerable investment on.

He's brilliant in the air and makes great last ditch efforts to block shots or get in a tackle which is all people focus on and which is why he looks great.


He's also massively error prone, doesn't listen to others and often has to make those last ditch efforts to stop shots or make tackles because he's not been able to read the game.



Yes he's been our best CB for the last couple of seasons but he's hardly had anything to be compared against. Agger was arguably our most complete CB but was constantly suffering injuries so was never getting enough game time for him to stand out. Carragher was near enough retired and couldn't keep up at times. 




Sakho is arguably our best CB currently and now he's getting more consistent game time will only improve more.

For the sake of anyone else still reading at this point:

&gt; We both know that if I asked you to show me anything compelling demonstrating something other than that Asians up north live in ghettos precisely because every generation of ethnic minority in this country has been forced to do so by racist whites, you'd have nothing

Immigrants originally moved to areas that were inexpensive because they came over with very little capital. As more joined them they also opted to live where their community had chosen to live (for reasons of jobs and cost). You are a moron if you think immigrants were *forced* to live in certain areas.

&gt; [Regarding the race riots] None of those kids woke up one day and thought ""I have a beef with whites for no reason"" and you know it.

What about the reverse? Did any of the white kids wake up one day and think ""I have a beef with the non-whites for no reason""? Again, you are a moron if you believe what you wrote. Inter-ethnic conflict springs from a number of factors ranging from tribalism to territory and everything in between. Perceptions of grievance, whether valid or not, feed into racism but come from as diverse sources as cultural misunderstandings and desire to appear dominant. 

&gt; I'm arguing that any discrimination suffered by Jews is insufficient to arouse feelings of having no future in the UK.

Again, you are a moron if you believe this. You cannot speak for other people in this way as their wants needs and desires are not the same as yours. Clearly some felt compelled to state in this study that the discrimination they experienced was sufficient to arouse feelings of having no future in the UK. That necessarily disproves your argument but has nothing to do with whether other demographics agree or disagree as they may have different expectations, tolerances or attitudes.

&gt; You are arguing that the discrimination suffered by Jews is equivalent in scope and magnitude to that suffered by blacks and Asians and therefore the attitudes cited in this report are legitimate as a result.

No, I am arguing that some Jews feel that the discrimination they suffer is sufficient to make them feel that they don't have a future in the UK. It may be that they suffer less than other minorities, it may be that they suffer more than other minorities, the point isn't whether they do or don't it is that they feel as a result of their suffering that the UK doesn't offer a future for them. Not that I expect you to understand the difference between the arguments on the strengths of your contributions thus far. 

&gt; Your big argument is that by failing to mention the discrimination suffered by British Jews that has already been highlighted in the article that post directly referring to, I'm what? Ignoring the discrimination suffered by British Jews that was already highlighted in the article I directly referred to.

Again, no. You argued that the discrimination suffered by Jews is less than other minorities. Then you came up with a couple of examples showing how other minority groups were discriminated against WITHOUT COMPARING THEM TO HOW JEWS ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. You then minimised what Jews may be experiencing by stating:

&gt; This is of course, directly comparable to the odd idiot who thinks the 150 Jews Britain has might side with Israel in the coming race war apocalypse.

You don't even seem to understand that this is what you did. And when I pointed this out you have misrepresented my argument or misunderstood it (and from your efforts so far I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that you haven't wilfully misrepresented things).

None of that really matters while MS are holding back patching of zero day exploits and providing them to the NSA ala Snowden.

&gt;Linux is pretty much run by RedHat these days which has government contracts coming out of its ears.

Except for the fact linux is forked by a thousand different distributions and you can view the code running on your computer. I mean sure in terms of computer security it could all boil down to the fact the software you're running was built on a compromised compiler - meaning even with access to the source code the software you're running is still compromised. 

I'd still take a linux operating system over Windows which only opens it's source code every now and again to be audited by different governments. 

Or Apple that is even more authoritarian over it's operating system. 

Now you could say ""well the compiler could be compromised at which point any software could be compromised"" but frankly I'll take software which can be audited *right here, right now* over blindingly using closed sourced software from companies that are known to actively work with the NSA/GCHQ, are known monopolies and provide zero day exploits to governments as well as the fact the US has secret courts which puts a gag on companies from even speaking out that they've been compromised (ala the lavabit debacle).

End-to-end encryption means that the information (the message) gets from the sender to the recipient without ever being decryptable.

Example: A mobile phone app that allows end-to-end secure messaging from one person to another person might, upon your registration, generate a public and private key for you, send them to your phone, where they're stored, and never store them on the central server.  Person A and Person B register, and Person A uses the app to get Person B's public key.  The app on Person A's phone encrypts the message with Person B's public key and sends it to the server, which then relays it to Person B's phone as soon as it's available.  It then sends the message to Person B, deleting it from its servers, and the app on Person B's phone decrypts the message using Person B's private key.

In that example, the information was encrypted from end-to-end: no person, company, or machine ever had access to the unencrypted data with the exception of the two Persons.",null,0,null,1421239287,null,0,false,0,cnolzzx,null,t3_2sab84,null,t1_cnolzzx,null,t1_cnoiq5x,null,null,null,1424883326,null,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2,null

They are very strict about not having kids until you are married. There's just no way they'd end up having children unless you get married. And when it comes to raising kids, they're pretty strict. Nothing bad, but they're not keen on them watching TV and would prefer they play outside.

People are still pretending the Tories haven't done a u-turn. You forget how heated the austerity debate got.

Counter intuitively the harder it fails the more people will cling to it like a religion. We see this in the Eurozone where austerity has sent entire populations onto the street. Every additional starving Greek is another reason for people to not admit that a terrible mistake was made.

It won't be admitted for 30 years that austerity was disastrous.

I wouldn't dismiss Cameron's proposals so quickly. Between every piece of popular cryptographic software on Windows/Android/iPhone/OSX/Linux, you have only 3 cryptographic libraries responsible for key negotiation (NSS, OpenSSL, CryptoAPI). In those libraries are each only a handful of functions responsible for generating session keys -- easily tweaked in a backwards-compatible fashion to produce 'random' keys using mechanisms similar to the [Clipper chip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip). The basis for the clipper chip was to mix some key material known to the government into the 'random' keys produced by the chip.

It comes off rather elitist.

Science shouldn't be politicised. I don't see how you can maintain your objectivity as a scientist if you also want to determine policy based on your research.

What we need is a system that protects the independence of science reporting, particularly those reports commissioned by the Government on social issues, with the findings fully public; that way it is always the politicians that have to account for their decisions if they don't reflect the current body of evidence (but account to us, not to researchers).

What we don't need is for scientists to try and short-cut changes in social policy by trying to bully politicians to impose them on the public. Changes to laws such as drugs legislation should be brought about by a change in the public perception of drugs first, which means a steady program of educating the public on these issues.

Surely the council should be forcing architects to face buildings off with a design that is in keeping with Edinburgh's past? 

When the Scandic Crown (now Radisson Blu) opened on the High Street a few years ago it was applauded as a new building that was made to look in keeping with the surrounding buildings. I see we don't do that any more. This should be an opportunity to get rid of an old out of place building and replace it with something to be proud of. Something that will be there for years. Not just to replace it with something that seems to have been designed without the architect actually walking down the streets and feeling the character of the buildings that have stood the test of time.",null,0,null,1421240633,null,0,false,0,cnomdhw,null,t3_2s623j,null,t1_cnomdhw,null,t3_2s623j,null,null,null,1424883078,null,0,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,0,null

Easy to fit. The hardest part is removing bar ends and your old grips, then there is always going to be some modification to the throttle tube required for any heated grips. These were shorter than the Honda standard so I had to manage the look of them.

I was expecting them to get 'vaguely warm' but they do get hot. They draw 2.5A, i hear that's a bit less than Oxford. That means - they take a little longer to get there and might not have the same top temp.

They do keep the temperature of your hand up and you can move your hand around to warm your fingertips or your thumb as required. Hands still get cold but not painfully so as before.

cons on this model

- I wish pressing the button went 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 since you'll always want to start on 5 then back off.

There's no way he doesn't know how to shoot with the level he plays at and he's clearly doing something right in training regularly if BR is still letting him really take the safety off and shoot on sight during games.

He's definitely really frustrating because of this as it's really the major part of his game that's lacking.  Some of the chances he makes for himself are amazing and he just can't finish them off.

All of the things you mentioned, the security services DO have access. Emails. Facebook. Credit card transactions. Bank accounts. They can access any of that by going to the provider with whatever legal stuff they need and getting access.

What DC pretty much said was that he doesn't think there should be services which can NOT be decrypted or accessed by the security services. Apple have made iMessage in such a way that even they can not decrypt things which go through their servers.

There's a big difference between blocking snooping on everybody (which is obviously a bad thing in terms of privacy), and encryption actually preventing security services, police etc from doing their jobs. 

Basically, I don't want anybody to routinely capture all my emails because it is unnecessary and overly intrusive. But I DO want them to be able to access suspected criminals' email accounts if they have a justifiable reason to. Thus, it's more about the use of the law and the encryption, rather than the encryption itself. I believe it's perfectly possible to balance our privacy interests and enable police and GCHQ to do their jobs. Yes, they have definitely overstepped in the past, but with the right controls it is totally possible to have a reasonable balance.

GCHQ and whatever have no problem with iMessage being encrypted. But when Apple themselves can't access messages or respond to valid warrants, that is definitely a problem.

That doesn't make it right, nor something we should allow without thought. Yet, it is one of the many tools the authorities use to stop those who wish to cause offence. The issue is not how they go about it, but how they decide on who to target.

A lazy, inefficient, and dangerous system would open all the mail, read all the messages, and then work out who could be an issue. However, you have now have all that information which is not necessary to your purpose, but is very valuable and can help you in other matters. This system is very morally wrong, and is what most people disagree with. Unless you remove the human element completely and try to maintain data security, even then it is a difficult problem.

What has been used to great effect is targeted surveillance. You receive tips from community leaders, data gathered from operations and neighbour agencies around the globe, and then you watch a target until you are sure of either they may be a threat, or may not be. With this, either gather evidence to convict or stop the target before any ill action is carried out. Yes some people will have their privacy invaded, but it is not acted on unless it poses a threat to the nation (taking drugs is not a threat to the nation for example). This is the type of surveillance that people are comfortable with (does not make it right but may be acceptable). Yet the issue with this is that any gap in your knowledge leaves you open to unseen threats.

And so you start to hear stories (snowden) about mass-surveillance and methods which are not targeted but form a blanket cover over everyone. The idea is that it is an automated process which has no prejudice towards a particular person. That identifies possible threats for further identification. The issue is that current methods create weaknesses in the technology today, putting us further at risk, and giving more power to other unsavoury groups. 

From this case I guess they had messages/information on certain suspects but couldn't decode the information in time until it was too late. Which is why Cameron probably came up with this daft policy of removing encryption. So people can deal with a group of spooks keeping eyes on everyone whilst shifting through your trash and mail. But people can't deal with an idiotic prime minister who has been poorly informed about the matter and makes glaring mistakes in policy matters.

TL:DR, People are use to surveillance and can live with the existence of spooks. People can't deal with idiotic decisions which threaten all aspects of daily life.

Imagine, he writes, if a man had joined the ""unity rally"" in Paris on 11 January ""wearing a badge that said 'Je suis Chérif'"" - the first name of one of the Charlie Hebdo gunmen. Suppose, Klug adds, he carried a placard with a cartoon mocking the murdered journalists. ""How would the crowd have reacted?... Would they have seen this lone individual as a hero, standing up for liberty and freedom of speech? Or would they have been profoundly offended?"" Do you disagree with Klug's conclusion that the man ""would have been lucky to get away with his life""?

I have wondered what the fallout would have been if someone had published a CH style cartoon of those who were killed. Something mirroring their own cartoons. Like the pacifist with the bowl-cut echoing the cover in which they mocked the FN. ""J'ai pas honte de le dire! Ca me va que les musulmans meurent a cause de moi!"" parodying the FN voter saying, ""I'm not ashamed to say it! I'm voting for Marine!"" (which was itself mocking the absurdity of FN party adverts and slogans). Because it would be funny right? It would be topical. Lampooning the CH masacre, the fact that the cartoonist was a pacifist, the dead cop who was a muslim, and the FN all in one go, all the while being edgy enough to question the status quo with cracking satire to boot. And why not? Why not march with that on a giant placard and a cartoonist signature of #TespasCharlie?

Footballers are assets.  They are brought in to hopefully make the club better.  This translates into more points in the league or doing better in the cups which translates into more money.

A club has to weigh up the benefits of keeping a player over selling them.

If we look at Bony:

Bought for 12mil.

Helped us to 13th place so probably got us somewhere between 5-8 million last year in terms of where we finished.  So made half is money back there arguably.  Relegation was also a real frightening possibility before he started scoring regularly so arguably saved us from a 20mil loss which is claimed to be the average loss for relegated sides in terms of income.  So now he has probably earnt the club back twice his cost.

This season he could probably have helped us reach 6th at most if we are realistic.  Which would have netted an extra 5mil.  

If he took us on to win both cups then that's only an extra few million quid.  

So to sell him for 25million guaranteed plus 3 million in extras.  Plus getting him off the wage bill his a big increase in what he could have earnt us this year (which is optimistically 12-15million). 

So we have more money to invest.  May find another star in the making.  The club isn't gutted of all the best players just one star player and we now have some funds to invest in the weaker areas of the squad.

Until we sell our soul to someone that can't print money (and I hope we don't) then we will stay in this cycle.  Hopefully we will keep finding and nurturing future stars for huge profit until we have a world class youth set up and can produce them ourselves for more profit.",null,0,null,1421244032,null,0,false,0,cnonitx,null,t3_2se6jt,null,t1_cnonitx,null,t1_cnon2rw,null,null,null,1424882542,null,7,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,7,null

No directly dominant winner between them, but if I assume a regular monthly investment then iWeb's £5 per adds up to £60/year, which works out less than the yearly percentages for balances over about £20-21k

Although, it occurs to me that I probably wouldn't drop it all into one fund (or maybe I need to look longer to find one that I would) and £5 per month *multiplied by a handful of different funds* stacks up pretty quickly and makes the percentage charge look more reasonable... which is perhaps why the figure mentioned is £32k rather than £20k.",null,0,null,1421244045,null,0,false,0,cnonj0j,null,t3_2rn7nl,null,t1_cnonj0j,null,t3_2rn7nl,null,null,null,1424882541,null,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1,null

And if we could, we did. We would do everything we can because we would store up brownie points.

null,false,speedboatjesus,null,null,null,"&gt;What we need is a system that protects the independence of science reporting, particularly those reports commissioned by the Government on social issues, with the findings fully public; that way it is always the politicians that have to account for their decisions if they don't reflect the current body of evidence (but account to us, not to researchers).

Completely agree, there needs to be a natural shift not an enforced one, otherwise it would just be political suicide really.

Surely though it should be the politicians' job to take the evidence and present it and explain it to the general public to at least begin a shift in popular opinion? By just ignoring research they are perpetuating outdated ideas.

With regards to drugs policy, yes it would be a bit authoritarian to take the evidence and despite being contrary to public opinion, implement new policies against the majority of the public's interest. But they should at least start saying ""well the evidence shows that this current policy isn't the best approach and we need to start working towards *this*, *this* and *this*"" If opposing politicians try to use it against them then they can just use the evidence presented to them and easily construct a logical argument and show that the opposing politician is just ""playing politics"" and are ignoring the evidence?

Then the public opinion would begin to move in the correct direction and policy changes could follow that. They are supposed to be leaders and I can imagine a lot of people base their opinions on those expressed by the political class.

Instead at the moment you have them basically ignoring research that is presented to them which leads to a fair portion of the general public doing the same?

For example, a boy wants to play with dolls, but he is told that those are for girls. Maybe teased at school and by siblings, even adult family members who don't realise the cumulative effect of it all. He then develops an aversion to anything ""girly"", and the caregiving profession is seen as a feminine one so he doesn't feel comfortable going into it. I'm not saying this boy would grow up to only ever be some sort of super macho-man, but those kinds of things can affect people.

I'll use myself as an example, because I think it's fairly relevant. My parents didn't care what I played with, so I played PC games and played with cars and played football in the garden, but I also played with with Barbies and Polly Pockets. But when I got older people started making fun of me for liking heavier music, gaming, and dressing ""like a boy"". They actually used to call me a man at school! For me personally it didn't change me because I'm a stubborn sonnuva bitch and like hell was I going to give in to that shit, but I still feel ""wrong"" for not being feminine. I'm still self-conscious about seeming too manly, and I try to suppress that a bit when I meet new people.

complaints into a super complaint because they said they were all from a few people and then used this to state that everybody was pro-ID card and would love to have them.

Or the opposition to Iraq illegal war 2. Lots of people protested. The government said fuck you and went and invaded anyway. As such it is fruitless and pointless to participate in UK politics. I mean my vote is worth 0.111 of a vote therefore I might as well throw it away (and I won't vote).

Edit: Since you’re going to downvote me rather than respond, I may as well add that the Jewish population of Palestine may have been 30% at the time Israel was created, but at the turn of the century there were only a handful of Jews in Palestine.

&gt; Do you pay the 'housing association'/owner of the building (no idea whats it called)

When dealing with a block of flats the ultimate owner of the whole building is referred to as the freeholder, because they own the freehold of the building. You would be one of a number of leaseholders since what you actually own is a lease on your flat within the building.

The freeholder may be a housing association, an individual investor or a company.  In some cases the company which owns the freehold is actually owned by the leaseholders and a share in that company passes with the lease.  It can all get quite complicated, and definitely something to investigate about any particular property you are looking at.

To answer the specific question, yes there will almost always be some some kind of annual charge which the leaseholders pay to the freeholder to cover the costs of maintenance and so on. The level of such charges can vary widely and definitely need to be considered with deciding whether a particular flat is a viable investment or not.

There is also a possibility that if major works are done on the building you may be required to pay towards them.

The [Leasehold Advisory Service](http://www.lease-advice.org/) is a good resource for the nuts and bolts of leasehold issues.

Yes, from what you've said, you've been to two Liverpool games. And you're trying to claim that one of them had the greatest atmospheres of all time.

Do you not see how hilarious and ridiculous that sounds?

You've even just admitted that things are subjective, so how can you claim something as the best ever?

&gt;The objective fact remains that this was the biggest crowd that Liverpool has ever played in front of, at an internationally famous venue. How can it not be? You've never watched LP with 95,000 people so how can YOU judge?

I'm judging because, while the size of the crowd is certainly impressive, it doesn't have much of an impact on atmosphere. More does not equal better. The very fact that you seem to equate size of support with atmosphere shows that you don't really have much experience of live football at all.

Selhurst Park for instance is about 1/3 the size of Old Trafford, but it has an exceptionally good atmosphere, and only a die-hard United fan would say that Old Trafford is better.

&gt;Again it's all subjective, but your comment of who's more ""entitled"" to comment on atmosphere is the most silly thing TBH. Perhaps because this was people's first and only time that they will see Liverpool out here made it just that much more special and awe-inspiring?

Yes but the issue here isn't a case of you saying the best atmosphere you'd ever experienced was in Australia and me saying it's not. That's not what this is about.

You said (unqualified) that it was the best ever at a Liverpool game, and I'm saying you can't possibly know that because you've been to just a couple of matches.

I've said several times now that I'm not saying it wasn't the best atmosphere ever. I couldn't possibly know. But I am saying it's ridiculous for you to claim something like that when you've only seen Liverpool a couple of times.

Remy and Bony have a similar goalscoring record in the EPL, so I really don't understand the thinking that he isn't effective as a lone striker. This is a player that has scored 4 goals for us while only playing less than 300 mins! 

Yes Drogba has been used more often by Jose but you have to remember that Remy was injured for a while and by the time he returned from injury he was unlucky that Drogba was in good form and scoring important goals (i.e the header against Utd). In the summer transfer window, we'll need to bring in another striker when Drogba retires, but there's absolutely no need to do so right now. Hold-up play from the striker isn't something we're in desperate need of and getting Bony isn't going to increase our chances of winning the title. If anything, there'll be more (and better) options available in the summer  i.e Alexandre Lacazette the Lyron striker that's scored 19 goals in 20 games.

null,false,peetss,null,null,null,"In 2012/2013 Redknapp did whatever he could to try to save the team from relegation.  A team that didn't want to be together for god sakes, I think the words ""toxic dressing room"" were thrown about.  He got in Remy, who turned out to be fantastic, and definitely worth the money he was getting.  Samba, not so much, but we did recoup our money on him.  The end of the season comes along and with it relegation.  The squad churn for the next season looks like this:

In: Dunne, Simpson, Austin, O'Neil, Kranjcar, Assou-Ekotto, Henry, Carroll, Phillips, Benayoun, Doyle.

Out: M'Bia, Granero, Park, Bosingwa, Mackie, Fabio, Diakite.  Not including the retirement of Derry and Nelsen.

For a grand total of 18 players who came into and left the squad.  That has a terrible effect on cohesion and chemistry and the fact we were still able to achieve promotion is a master class on the part of Redknapp in my opinion.  Not only that but the atmosphere in the change room improved dramatically, something which, as I said, plagued us in 2012/2013.  So the end of the season comes and we absolutely barely achieve promotion, with a side that did not have enough quality to compete in the top flight.

So we come back back for the 2014/2015 season and with the exception of Mutch and thus far, Ferdinand, Redknapp injects quality into the side in the form of Fer, Isla, Vargas, Caulker and Sandro.  We lose an ungodly amount of away games, albeit to top sides, and maintain a fairly decent home record.  Then we lose to Burnley away, arguably the one team we should've been able to get points from, due to an uncharacteristically bad performance, and we all go off the chain and call for Redknapp's head.

Regardless of what anyone says, the club has made progress since two years ago.

I too really support the 3-4-2-1, it lets us use some players (like Markovic) who otherwise would have a difficult time breaking into the squad. The diamond was good when we had to find a way to play two world-class strikers, and the threat they posed allowed us to keep pressure off Gerrard so he could launch attacks from deep. However, this year we pose no such threat, and I don't think we should be changing our style to try and play Balotelli and Sturridge together (despite how promising they were against Tottenham). In the diamond I think Lallana/Sterling/Markovic/Coutinho all should play at the tip of the diamond, but obviously only one can. I also think Coutinho is the only one of those who is decent in the box-to-box role Henderson excels in, so I gave him that slot. I don't like the Gerrard-Lucas pairing, especially in the diamond, and at this point I think every prospective starting-XI has to include Lucas.

In defence, I'm not comfortable playing Moreno in a back four. With the back three he has Sakho covering for him when he makes a mistake or gets stuck upfield, this is not really the case in the diamond.

My wife is Chinese. Not ""*of Chinese descent*"", but proper Hukao owning resident of the PRC.

""Face"" is a big deal in China, it basically means that no-one can admit fault or not look like ""the big man"" at all times. Which, is of course, incredibly frustrating.   
To give an example; I was applying for jobs in China and I pencilled in an interview over the phone and the employer promised to send me an email with all the details (address, exact time etc). I waited and waited for an email that never arrived. I checked my junk folder and called the number back repeatedly (no answer) for days. On the day that we had pencilled in the interview, I got a call from the employer asking where I was. I explained that I had not received the email and could not contact them. Instead of rescheduling an interview and/or apologising for the misunderstanding, the employer spent 10 minutes arguing that they had done nothing wrong as they had; A) definately sent the email, and B) given me their email address so I could have contacted them. Neither of those were even close to true and the whole thing was a giant waste of time. Why argue over something that is clearly your fault and not even important? That's Chinese culture!   
People care more about their petty pride than getting things done.

My wife is VERY Westernised, but it's still an issue occasionally, especially with her family.

I was raised Protestant and went to a Catholic school; so it was drummed into me that pride and vanity will result in a fiery hell. My wife was raised to hold pride above ANYTHING else. Cultural difference.    
Luckily, she realises that the Chinese face thing is retarded and is actively changing her atttude (thank fuck!).

And... Chinese culture is very old fashioned. It took my wife a while to get used to the idea that I have female friends. Chinese gender culture is like the Victorian age or something. The entire Chinese office staff thought I was having an affair because I talked to an American female colleague....

Also, cheese. Took me a while to convince her that there is better cheese than those crappy plastic cheese slices you find in McBurgers.

People complain Remy hasn't seen enough minutes, it won't be any better for Bamford, it's not a difficult concept to understand but people don't seem to realise it. 3rd choice means he'd come on for 5 minutes tops, would barely start games either as the 2nd choice would get priority. For a player his age who needs games that's not good enough and would stunt his development. Whilst I agree he's done brilliantly on loan, the highest level he's bloody played at is the championship. He's not proven in the premier league and certainly not what you need from a 3rd choice striker if you're pushing for the title every season.

People said we should play Chalobah and he struggled to get games at Burnley on loan. If he ain't getting games at Burnley, he aint getting games here yet. I'd love to promote youth but they'd be nothing worse than promoting them before they're ready, resulting in them not playing and not getting better as a result. And if they did play and were awful we'd be up shit creek. Look how piss poor we were upfront with Torres. If Costa got injured (hardly unlikely) we'd be left with Remy and Bamford. If we need a goal we'd have to bring on an unproven in this league player. who would be expected to help change the game. That's so much pressure.

And don't point to Harry Kane because we're not Tottenham. Even then with their abysmal strikeforce before he played he only featured in europa league games. We won't be playing Asteras Tripolis in the champions league.

Realistically we are challenging for the title every season, so we won't take a chance on young players. That's a fact. Even this season the academy players have only featured in dead rubbers. Whether I agree with that or not (I do to an extent) it's wrong to expect all these youth players to suddenly start.

null,false,bobbingblondie,null,null,null,"I didn't buy to let, I ""let to buy"" but I guess the end result is the same.  I already owned a flat when I found a house I wanted to buy.  There was no time to sell and my flat is in a prime rental area, so I remortgaged it on a BTL basis to get the deposit for the house.

My experience is that it is expensive.  On paper rent in minus the mortgage out leaves a profit, but by the time I've paid for everything I'm subsidising the place a lot.  In 2 years I've had to replace the boiler and the washing machine, and the fridge freezer has just died.  The upkeep of the common areas in the building also has a cost.  Eventually it will become profitable, but not for at least 3 or 4 more years.  On the bright side I'm not paying any tax on it at the moment!

You also really need to have some DIY skills.  I'm not bad at a lot of things, but I'm very lucky that my Dad is an awesome DIYer.  He can take care of everything at the flat except for gas appliances.  If it wasn't for him I would have spent hundreds on contractors in the last 2 years.

Despite all this, I'm now taking on another property.  My fiancé's flat is currently on the rental market as we are now living together.  He has no interest in it beyond not wanting to sell it (again it is in a popular rental area and also the catchment area for a great school that our house is just outside) and so I will be the one managing it and my Dad will play the handyman again.  It won't be profitable for a few years either, but it should at least pay for itself.

We're fortunate that we can afford to absorb the extra costs and in the long run both will start providing an income.  However, if we had bought these properties in order to let them out I would not be feeling positive about the whole situation!

In a non-quantitative evaluation, it's clear that we've been more fluid and creative in the last few weeks, with players starting to click and look more confident than before. And as the numbers point out our biggest problem recently has been finishing, which unfortunately Sterling is quite poor at and Rickie and Mario aren't much better. Sturridge leading the line will help the goal scoring immensely even just from a finishing perspective, never mind the fact that he'll likely contribute significantly to chance creation. My biggest concern is now going to be that we won't maintain intensity across the entirety of a match and will start sitting back defending crosses and set pieces, which we are still quite poor at.

2 - If you come to A&amp;E and it’s neither an accident nor an emergency then you'll be sent to a random hospital department to be practiced on.

3 - Foreign Policy. Germany has been too quiet for too long. Just saying.

4 - Immigration. This is the greatest country in the world and people want to move here. We need an MP to make things worse. Look no further

5 - Education. Instead of a postcode lottery a new improved Street Raffle will determine which schools your kids get in to. #commonsense

6 - Alex Salmond to be made First Minister for Norwich, so he can understand what being ignored by the rest of the country is really like.

7 – Europe. I pledge that the UK will leave Europe by 2025 and the edge of the Solar System by 2050.

8 - The Environment. Boris Johnson to be put on an island. He keeps saying that’s what he wants.

9 - Corporations and Globalisation. Blah blah blah paradigm blah blah blah, blah blah dialectic blah blah blah blah blah blah game-changer.

null,false,pheasant-plucker,eng-sussex,"Sussex (Hove, Actually)",null,"Government finance is very different from personal finance. 

For a start, government has many ways to cut debt, besides paying it off. It could trigger inflation - so the debt shrinks. Or it could grow income (so debt becomes less as a % of overall economy - which is the metric we're interested in).

Also, the key problem we have is a loss of confidence, which means that businesses aren't investing, which means they aren't spending, which means that other businesses and people aren't earning. All of which causes a negative spiral. 

And the outcome of that negative spiral is decreased tax revenue, which puts the government into debt.

If the government now cuts spending, then all that happens is that the negative spiral gets even worse - because now everyone, private and public, is stopping spending.

When the problem is temporary lack of confidence and demand, the government needs to keep spending - in fact increase spending - despite tax revenues declining. 

It sounds counterintuitive, but in the long run it's the best way to help the economy back on its feet, which will (eventually) increase tax revenues and reduce debt.

A final point - remember that government debt is owned mostly by British nationals. So this isn't Britain in hock to foreigners (some is, but then we own about the same of other government's debt so it balances out). Our 'national debt' simply a transfer of wealth between public and private sector.

During their formative years, many of today's politicians took this evidence on board, and adopted the belief that supporting drug legalisation was career suicide for a mainstream politician.

Over the years, the views of the public changed. Surveys reveal that the average British voter is quite liberal in their views on drugs. For example: https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3134/Public-attitudes-to-drugs-policy.aspx

He's also a pretty talented CB. In the few games he played for the first team last season he impressed. He's partially the reason I'm not worried if we lose Kaboul or Chiriches because I believe Milos can step up in almost no time and perform to a level that we need. 

Of all our youth players that have yet to see consistent, real time, I think Veljkovic is the most deserving. Would be excited to see him get a game in in the coming months.

So what do you think about those that don't? I'm sure you know that the Quran (along with many other religious texts) are chock full of contradictions and inaccuracies.

What you seem to be suggesting is that anyone who doesn't follow the laws of the land in which they reside must not be a ""proper"" muslim.

I'm sorry to say this is a very common argument primarily used by the religous and their apologists to divert the conversation away from their faith and onto the individual, as if the individuals experience with a particular religion is totally and utterly divorced from their actions as an individual. Which I'm sorry is a load of bollocks.

There are hundreds of millions of people out there who identify as muslim which I'm sure you will be able to label one way another as not a ""proper"" muslim due to their actions. You are of course aware of Sunni/Shia conflict? Who's right? They both claim to be ""proper"" muslims but clearly their opinions differ enough to result in conflict across the globe.

&gt;Secondly, no country out there follows islamic law.

Think you are being a bit pedantic here. Lots of countries invoke sharia/islamic law to some extent. There may not be a well defined ""Islamic law"" but just look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_of_sharia_law_by_country

&gt;The pair continued their on-off relationship with trysts in London, Cardiff, Leeds and Los Angeles - although Ms Mjadezlics told the court she was disgusted by Watkins' sexual interest in children and boasts of sex with underage fans. She said she was trying to gather evidence against him.

&gt;Ms Mjadzelics reported Watkins to police and social services in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012 to raise the alarm over his child sex crimes.

&gt;But a court heard police refused to collect the phone and computer of Mjadzelics after she told them he had sent her indecent images of a ""very young girl being raped"".

&gt;She told the jury she repeatedly went to the police and Watkins family about his paedophile activities but was not believed until 2012.

&gt;Deputy Chief Constable for South Wales Police, Matt Jukes, said: ""We respect the decision of the court today

When we come to the midfield here lies the big problem. Henderson and Emre Can is really the only ones who in 2 years will be class. Allem and Lucas are decent, nothing more. Where Allen at the moment seems to be more of a luxuary player, that plays fantastic next to a defensive midfielder who is stronger, but he gets easely bullied by stronger midfielders like we did see against Newcastle and West Ham. 
Gerrard will be gone after this season and Lucas will most likely be sold in the next 2 seasons. There is a big need for another midfielder. 

Defense is even worse, only Sakho with potential work class. Lovren has been meh, Skrtel is a decent CB and work well in a 3 men defense. Kolo Toure is getting older.

We've never had a truly possession orientated midfield, we're more of a pressing counter attacking team. He'd help Rodgers instill his game.

If we got Pjanic we could replace Allen who isn't good enough for CL, and then you could play Can/Lucas holding, Hendo next him.

The content of my calls isn't recorded for future access, akaik, by my mobile phone network provider, and the details of the numbers I dialled or received calls from can only be accessed with a warrant, and none of that stuff is encrypted. 

I have no problem with a scenario where, upon my becoming suspected of a crime, recordings of the content of my phone calls is subsequently collected. I wouldn't want all my calls recorded just in case I might become suspected of a crime in future, and law enforcement then wanting to go back and look at my historic call content.

With internet activity, it's more complicated because the content is often strongly encrypted. To be able to access that information, regardless of moral or legal considerations, is a significant technical challenge, which nobody has come up with a good proposal for. I'm interested to hear yours.

&gt;deliberately writing encryption which even they can't break. 

I don't want to get into an argument about who knows more about encryption... but can you not see how encryption is supposed to be inherently unbreakable, otherwise it's pointless? 'deliberately' creating an encyption system to be unbreakable is the same as creating a car that can drive, that's what it's for.

In order to decrypt encrypted communications data, the only feasible way is to have access to the key, which, as I referenced in my previous comment, is not something that be facilitated without invading the privacy of users (isps would have to relay secure communication using a key known to them [typically this is called a man-in-the-middle attack]).

There are a couple of issues with this. 1 is that, unless they come up with a very clever solution, a user will know when this has been activated for their internet connection (also it would be known to the entity to which they try to connect), or alternatively, the isp would have to be always mitm-ing secure traffic, which is the approach I believe the security and law enforcement interests will advocate, and which is thus a permanent invasion of the privacy of individuals who are not suspected of any crime.",null,0,null,1421253128,null,0,1421253581,0,cnos2j4,null,t3_2sanz7,null,t1_cnos2j4,null,t1_cnopjvl,null,null,null,1424880421,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

Indeed - the turn of the century example illustrates that - but it also shows that people like to have gender-associated colours.

&gt;Also, do kids really care if you acknowledge their gender or not? 

Most definitely - especially girls. Hence pretending it's irrelevant or a problem is always going to be an uphill climb.

&gt;In what way?

Take a girl into a toyshop and show her Lego 'friends' - it's especially girly lego that's all pinks and pastel colours. They go *mad* for it, because they feel like it's been made more specifically for them.

Not sure why I would give it the edge over Shaun of the Dead. I suspect it's the fact that in both cases you've got Pegg as the straight man and Frost as the funny man, but:

* In Shaun of the Dead, Pegg is hapless-straight

* In Hot Fuzz, Pegg is ridiculously-competent-straight

and for me, the uber-competence works better opposite Frost than the trying-but-hapless.

The other thing is that *you could imagine it happening*. A zombie apocalypse is unlikely -  Hot Fuzz is closer to home compared with a comedy zombie romp in London.

The concept of Hot Fuzz is sheer brilliance because lots of us know a little market town or village - perhaps a bit less picturesque than Wells, but sleepy and rural where the Parish Council or local committee is usually run by some overbearing retired primary school teacher accustomed to bossing everyone around, and the pub doesn't make a habit of asking for ID. The idea of the Neighbourhood Watch murdering any miscreants makes you look at your own Village Hall committee twice, and the fact they end up having a car chase in diesel Astras is just a hilarious reflection on British Policing.

We are getting an MLS team in 2017 and I am beyond excited it. Currently, I go to school in Mississippi which is basically a black hole for professional soccer but anytime I'm in Atlanta I go watch the Silverbacks, or if I'm in a different city for the summer, like Houston, I'll go watch the Dynamo or any soccer. A lot of people in the states rag on lower league soccer, but I love going to see the Silverbacks and the atmosphere of lower league matches. Strangely, it is a lot easier for me to keep up with Swansea in terms of news and watching matches on a weekly basis then it is for the Silverbacks. But once the MLS team gets up and running then it will be covered more in the sporting press and on television. 

I started causally watching the Premier League about 6 years ago, but wasn't too into it and most the people I would watch it with were all Chelsea fans. I'd say about 3 years ago I started watching it religiously and wasn't too concerned about ""picking"" a team. But after watching a few Swansea matches, and really enjoying the style of play Swansea played, and then looking into the history, fan base, and ownership structure/management of the club, I fell in love. 

I know that  my love for the club will never match a local's who sat in a shed supporting a plucky provincial League 2 team week after week. The locals that stuck with the club through all 4 levels are the life blood of this club. It is that passion that's based upon genuine love, not on big name players or flashy ownership groups, that drew me to Swansea and what I believe makes this club great. Certainly I can watch as many games as a local, or keep up with the news as much as a local, or cheer just as loud in front of a TV as a local, but I will never match their dedication and deep affection for Swansea City.

Nope, there are [literally thousands of representations of Muhammed in art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depictions_of_Muhammad), both modern and historic.

It's not the mere act of drawing that's the issue; if you **take the piss** out of a religious figure you get into trouble. I guess you forgot about the controversy behind The Holy Grail as well as the time the BBC had to have several of it's bosses take their families into hiding and hire mercenaries to defend themselves from death threats over their airing of Jerry Springer The Opera.

null,false,Alwaysfair,null,null,null,"&gt;You provided upsides of the technology, but you didn't explain how any of those offset the huge disadvantages of cost and difficulty of maintenance, not to mention the losses inherent to beaming the power down through the atmosphere.
Ground-based solar power provides a vital and valuable addition to the Earth's energy needs, but is limited by these factors:
* Weather
* Variable seasons
* Atmospheric blocking of sunlight
* Poor direct sunlight at higher and lower latitudes
* Expensive and limited storage capacity
Because none of these factors applies to SBSP, an SBSP cell can provide an estimated 6-8 times more power than a comparable solar cell on the Earth's surface. That’s a large margin even when accounting for a 10% transmission loss, for comparison current land based studies drop around a [3% of the electricity they carry per 1,000km. ](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/11/sahara-solar-panels-green-electricity)


Beaming the power down I have covered, again one of the first posts I left, I linked you to a report which proved efficiencies of close to 90% over a range of transmissions.

&gt;won't be able to overcome these problems for decades either

Correct, the time scale was never in doubt, I have frequently stated that this is a long run technology, no one has set a deadline, there is plenty of time for this technology to mature and help combat the issues of earth based resources.

&gt;Geography is not nearly as much of a factor as you're trying to make out. 

The US 5th fleet would I am sure beg to differ on that point.

&gt;You'll recall that I said that the world's energy needs could be met with solar covering a grand total of 2% of the world's deserts.

Yes you have stated this several times and it does appear to check out I must say. However it is worth bearing in mind the huge increases in energy demand we are going to see over this century, In 2013 the EIA conservatively projected world energy consumption will increase 56% by 2040 [here]( http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=12251). If that is to be the case then more and more technologies such a SBSP will indeed become viable and energy cost rise.


&gt;You really ought to take the threat of climate change to civilisation (and its accumulated knowledge base) quite seriously. Those notoriously hysterical longhairs at the US Department of Defense do. Essentially every scientist in the most relevant fields does. Get with the program. There's no excuse any more.

Not quite a here toady gone tomorrow problem though, I get bored by the whole issue you to tell you the truth, I leave it to others to discuss such issues, just let me know how much extra I need to pay and get on with it. 

&gt;But space solar isn't going to be worth pursuing for a long time yet, and the effort and resources required to roll it out on any significant scale would be far better spent on building sustainable infrastructure down here

That long time would appear to be several decades according to all the evidence and research we have to go on. Like I have said many times, this is a long run technology and one which when it arrives will have a profound impact on the means in which the generate energy. Not a short run, quick fix.

The difference is that these councils are not accountable to anyone nor are they particularily transparent. At the very least, if you go to a Police station your report should be noted and it will leave a trail.

So in that respect, I don't think these work well, whether for Muslims, Jews or any other minority group where community pressure can act in such a way that these courts wield more than just advisory powers.

Basically the Bolivians moved the border markers like 30 kilometres south, and had the people living within that territory intimated to either leave, or adopt the Bolivian citizenship. The Argentine government allowed it, even though it was a clear violation of previous limit treaties, and both the Province's Governor (who's very close to the president) and the President herself refused to address the issue altogether. 

The thing is the Bolivians have been pretty agressive over the past few years claiming lands that have been Argentine since limits were defined, or directly invading our territory and taking stuff. A few years ago their army invaded the Province of Salta, destroyed a few fences, stole a tractor and other materials, and run off. They also shot a farmer who resisted. It all sounds very third worldish, and is in fact quite funny when you think about it, but still, rather than giving in the government's job is to protect the people living in those lands.

This is the link (in spanish) to the invasion incident.

&gt; For a grand total of 18 players who came into and left the squad. That has a terrible effect on cohesion and chemistry and the fact we were still able to achieve promotion is a master class on the part of Redknapp

You forgot to add Morrison, Keane, Maiga, and magical right wingback Aaron Hughes too. Redknapp has to take responsibility for the revolving door of random faces last season, and in turn any resulting lack of cohesion. I thought the team that faced Sheffield Wednesday on the opening day looked ok, but by the end of the season we were cheering on an almost entirely different group of players.

&gt;the atmosphere in the change room improved dramatically

But not in the stands. Thankfully this season has been an improvement, although the last two or three games have been a bit subdued.

&gt;Then we lose to Burnley away, arguably the one team we should've been able to get points from, due to an uncharacteristically bad performance, and we all go off the chain and call for Redknapp's head.

With respect, many have disliked him from long before the Burnley game, often without actually calling for his head, although no tears would be shed by them if he was slung out.

&gt;Regardless of what anyone says, the club has made progress since two years ago.

Really? As a squad of players, yeah, they're doing better (at home). Elsewhere though? We really should have been cutting the wage bill last year. With the contracts in place it was always going to be impossible to avoid the FFP breach, but all of those players in on loan would have pumped up the wage bill further, in several cases needlessly so. Warren Farm is looking shaky. OOC is looking even more problematic, with landowner opposition and project cheerleader Johnson on his way back to Parliament. The youth setup won't be Southampton any time soon. Even the younger players in the first team have shown no signs of improvement under the Redknapp-Bond-Jordan triumvirate. I'd say Redknapp is just a symptom of the larger problem though - bar a few heroic shifts from the likes of the ticket office and the media team, the club just seems so poorly run. £200mn+ of debt, with what to show for it? It's insane. Even a club run as badly as Blackpool isn't lumbered with those figures.

This bit is quite possibly the worst advice ever.

This is what will make it easy and you'll get it first time.

1. Accelerate

2. When you get through the gates,  CUT THE THROTTLE

3. Use the bars to counter steer around the cone. Your body weight is not enough to twitch around the cone.

4. Take a wide line. On the actual test you have loads of space so don't be afraid to use it. Don't get too close to the inside cover.

5. Pass your fucking test.

For the rest of your show speed stuff - same deal as always. About 4K constant RPM and just keep the throttle there. Clutch on the biting point and use the back break to control your speed.

What's wrong with it? You are free to think Israelis or Palestinians are savages if you want, it's rare someone would think both of them are civilized peoples. Your comment is really no better than the poster anyway - you say Israel is extremely deserving of criticism, and the poster is saying Palestinians are the ones deserving of criticism, it just uses a little more extreme language but that doesn't make any difference. Plenty of people call Israel a terrorist state and all sorts of ignorant nonsense, and they are free to have their opinions on it. An Irish news presenter called Israel the cancer of the middle east. Russel Brand says Israel indiscriminately kills Palestinian children (demonstrably false). 10 O'Clock Live had a segment on Israel and joked that Israel loves killing Palestinian children, and there was no media outcry about it. If you disagree with criticism, give an argument as to why it's wrong, don't shut down discussion by crying racism/bigotry. There's nothing inherently wrong with hating a country for their politics.

That people found the poster to be racist was quite racist - it infantalises the Palestinians, treating them as innocent victims not responsible for their own actions. Can you imagine Iran being called racist for saying the USA was a savage country? Call me a bigot all you want, but jailing unwed mothers for 5 years as Hamas do is savage and uncivilized.

I don't personally think along the lines that were expressed by weewoo4444 and so failed to consider where he was coming from. With regard to 'blaming' everyday Christians for things: You are indeed correct - the labelling of an entire group isn't on. My own arguments above were speaking of the church insofar as it pertains to the establishment. You may think I'm back tracking, but hopefully I'll make myself clearer here. With all that in mind, I'll answer a few of your points:

&gt; The historic influence the Church held in this country has absolutely no relation to the beliefs of everyday Christians in this country today. 

Yes, entirely. In fact I would go so far as to say that the current manner in which the Church-in-power behaves doesn't bear much of a relation to how your common or garden Christian would like them to.

&gt; [Current Sunday trading laws are as they are...] because the government wishes it to be that way.

Yes, I agree (though I think it's the case that (practising) Christians are disproportionately present in government)...

&gt;  To imply that the Church has enough power in this country to insist things stay this way is absurd.

.... But no, it's not absurd, at least so long as you're not taking the position that is *entirely* due to the Church. In that instance we'd come back to your position that I acknowledge above: yes, 'blaming' Christians is a simplified (and bigoted) position. However it is the case that the CoE does have 'unfair' influence over government and seems to often 'get their way' or have specific exemptions. Of course that's not least in part due to the number of (Conservative) Christians in government, be it in the HoC or more so the Lords.

On the exemptions front: one example is the Equality Act 2010. In the Lords there was a motion to have certain exemptions for religious groups removed. In particular the allowance for faith schools which can 'choose not to employ or sack a homosexual teacher', as was allowed under the wording. The Bishop of Oxford (iirc) said that he couldn't believe that a faith school would choose to use the law in this way, but still voted against the amendment (I'll find the relevant Hansard link if you want).

&gt; Doing mental gymnastics to try and defend bigoted opinions

I should be clearer that that wasn't my intention, but hopefully I've made that clear now.

As to some of the rest, I think that maybe you're assuming I'm in the ""fuck all Christians!"" camp, which is why you may have sent these questions my way, but I'll answer them anyway:

&gt; Where is your evidence public opinion being in favour of assisted dying?

[Any number of opinion polls](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/07/05/support-doctor-assisted-suicide/), but of course I acknowledge the problem with them. Still, one needs a benchmark.

&gt; And sex education is compulsory in schools

We may be talking at crossed purposes and I should have been more specific: some asoects are, some aren't. [""Some parts of sex and relationship education are compulsory - these are part of the national curriculum for science. Parents can withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationship education if they want.""](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/other-compulsory-subjects) 

However, crucially I believe it is the case that the curriculum is not set nationally: schools can teach as much, or as little, as they want outside of the science class, and in those cases the teaching can be influenced by the faith ethos of the school e.g. [CoE schools](https://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/education/church-schools-faqs/faqcofeschools.aspx#sexed). Moves to produce a set compulsory curriculum have, I believe, been resisted in the HoC. There was a specific instance a few years back - I shall provide link, again if you'd like?

&gt; To attempt to blame them for Sunday opening hours, as if Christians had any more power or influence than every other individual in this country, is bigoted and should be treated as such.

I wasn't attempting to 'blame' [all Christians] - again I was looking at the establishment. Having said that I think you'd struggle to find a specific reason, other than the obvious, as to why Sunday still continues to be 'different'. But as I said before, I need to delve into Hansard for some quotes. And again - that's not 'all Christians'.

As you might expect most Christians have secular views when asked, mainly because they're entirely sensible people.

I hope you didn't expel too much ire on me: for what it's worth, again, I agree with your overall points. Both with regard to the opinion and the subreddit in general.

Few things you should know: First and foremost, our song (Bubbles) is a very accurate depiction of our long-suffering club. We have dreams. Dreams of titles. Dreams of European glory... but most years those dreams, like bubbles, fade and die.

There are roughly as many Americans on this sub as there are supporters from anywhere else on the globe. Some of us have been supporting the club for a very long time, some of us only the last few seasons... but one thing is for certain: Once you've pledged your support no other club will ever mean half as much to you.

We have the best supporters in the world. We are united in the fact that WE won the World Cup in '66. We are united in the fact that WE are the Academy of Football. We are united in the fact that WE are a small club with big dreams. We are the club of Di Canio and Hurst, of Bonds and Dicks. We are the club of Bobby FUCKING Moore, greatest defender to ever grace this Earth.

Stick around awhile. I do my best to keep everyone here well informed on the latest news with the club. This sub is the place to go if you want to know what's happening and I promise you there won't be a day that goes by that you'll feel misinformed if you've stopped by /r/Hammers.

Originally their playing of politics was intended to rebalance the political process in the interest of ordinary working people. In recent years they have completely failed to do this. I've got no idea why they still donate to the Labour party. 

The big problem I saw as a union member was that most members didn't get all that involved. This left the running open to people with extreme views which didn't necessarily correspond with the interests of the members. 

For example they would try to schedule meetings when most people were at work, or spin out meetings till 02:00 and then once everyone but them had given up and gone home, passed a few more motions. 

But that's a problem with all types of democratic institutions. Look at the turnout for local elections or the membership of political parties. People claim that UKIP is stuffed full of swivel-eyed loons: that's because swivel-eyed loons have the time and energy to get involved.

They might allow one-way tickets down though.  Check.

A fairly easy (depending on fitness) hike is to park at the Day Lodge (Base station), then hike a loop taking in Ben Macdui and Cairn Gorm, getting the train back down to the Day Lodge at the end.  It's a bit of a drag, the walk back down.

Note that the chairlift does not run from the Day Lodge, but further round the hill.  Don't know if it runs for hikers though in the summer.

I dunno, an extra 300 seems pretty menial to me at that point. 

18 x 50 + 3 cl games x 75 + 4 cup games x 50 = around 1500 for a season. anyways my point being, money is money and more money is always harder to swallow, but it just seems that all of the fans who want us to go after all of these players don't seem willing to ""invest in the team"" when there are increases. while i do agree that at one point, enough is enough (im a redskins fan, im tired of paying close to 100 for the very last row in the stadium) but that price point seems pretty low and that's for lower level seats at anfield. 

he defines actual supporters as scouse blooded reds. no problem in highlight that they are ""real supporters"" because they are from there, but we are real supporters from around the world that help to make liverpool at a top 10 earning club globally and the 6th most engaged club via digital outlets. so yes, ""actual supporters"" may be priced out, but there are ""actual supporters"" everywhere. why don't you try looking up videos from thailand, malaysia, and melbourne where there are at least 60,000 strong singing YNWA and all the other players cheers. liverpool football club, around the world, has supporters who are knowledgeable of our rich history, so i do take some offense to that if you are considering foreigners not ""real supporters"" because even if every person in liverpool, or england for that matter, supporter liverpool, it would touch the number of supporters coming from even other countries in europe, let alone the rest of the world (especially asia)...

It's not hard to understand, indeed it's quite simple.  People (in area's without much immigration tellingly) with a predisposition to xenophobia and tired of same old politics have an alternative party vote.  A party is that funded by former Tory supporters/bankers made up of Tory rejects who's views are quite often deplorable.  As the platform is released the support will drop as right now their support is based on one issue (immigration).   

As for fact/opinion, I understand the difference.  The above is an opinion and no small part a stereotype.  It happens to be an opinion shared by most though.

Rangel has looked a liability to the Swans on more than one occasion this season and looks like age is quickly catching up with him at this point. I thought Richards would eventually become the replacement for them but he doesn't look like he has kicked on enough to do so....

Naughts gives them a steady, if unspectacular, defensive option at RB who can give them consistency.

null,false,nsharma146,null,null,null,"hey, just seen this quote from the National Health Action Party and it explains a little bit why privatisation is bad for the NHS if you're still interested


The National Health Action Party is calling for a full fact-finding inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the withdrawal of private company Circle from the running of Hinchingbooke Hospital – and for the hospital to be brought back under NHS management.
Speaking ahead of today’s public meeting in Huntingdon, co-leader of the NHA Party, Dr Clive Peedell said:
“Tory and Labour politicians seem happy wasting time pointing fingers at one another over who is responsible for the fiasco of awarding Hinchingbrooke hospital to Circle in the first place. It’s time to put aside the political wrangling and focus on the facts and to lift the veil of commercial confidentiality.
“We want to see publication of the full accounts of the Trust – including where any cash from selling the hospital’s assets has gone to. Under its contract, Circle acted in effect as the directors of the Trust. So were there any land sales made – and if so, did the proceeds go to Circle or to the Trust?
“We want a full audit to show how much this whole exercise has cost the NHS, including the cost of management time while negotiating the contract and what will be need to be spent by the NHS as it picks up the pieces.
“The boss of NHS East of England has already been asked searching questions by the Commons Public Accounts Committee about how the whole project was floated. These must now be followed up.
“We want to know why, when Circle won the deal on the basis of offering even bigger savings than other contenders over 10 years, were they not required to set out any plans for how this might be done?
“We want to know why, when Circle changed their contract after they were selected, delaying the time when they would repay the debts of £40 million, was this change agreed to rather than going back to the other bidders?
“We want the senior regional NHS managers who were involved in the decision-making process in regard to the award of the Hinchingbrooke franchise to be held fully to account for their actions.
“We demand that Hinchingbrooke hospital be brought immediately back into the NHS, and swift measures taken to support staff to ensure high quality care and patient safety. It must not be put out again to private tender.
“Hinchingbrooke is the second hospital that has been franchised to a private company, and the second time that the private company concerned has failed to fulfil its side of the bargain. In 2003, the Good Hope hospital in Birmingham was franchised for three years; the contract was ended eight months early after the hospital deficit rose from £839,000 to £3.5 million. We have confirmation in Hinchingbrooke, if confirmation were needed, that the private sector is not a panacea when it comes to running NHS district general hospitals.
”Many private firms have now pulled out of tendering for NHS services because they don’t see any profit in them. A recent £800m contract for elderly care in Cambridgeshire ended up being awarded to an NHS-led consortium, but not before a million pounds was wasted on the tendering process. In Kent, the private company Concordia Health pulled out of running Kent GP practices leaving thousands of patients told to find a new doctor.
”Privatising the entire NHS is clearly not a viable scenario for the private sector. Its interest remains in cherry-picking elective services and other sectors where they may be able to squeeze a profit. The damage this does to the NHS as a whole, both financially and it terms of care, is evident and growing. The billions of pounds wasted on the huge administrative and legal costs of the competitive market are billions that are being diverted away from patient care.
“To allow this privatisation to continue and even grow, purely on ideological grounds, when its practical failures are multiplying for all to see, is a betrayal of public trust.”",null,0,null,1421260760,null,0,false,0,cnowth7,null,t3_2s2985,null,t1_cnowth7,null,t1_cnlmap4,null,null,null,1424878069,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Depending on the circumstances, she MIGHT have policy input (through Alex Salmond), like the Lib dems (ha ha) do. You never know, the SNP might even get ministerial cabinet roles, even if it's confined to something like the Scotland Office or junior ministerial roles.

&gt;Perhaps a potential solution would be several 'official' debates for both the UK, and Scotland, Wales and N.I. There could be several nationwide 'Prime Ministerial Debates' complemented by debates between the leaders of the major parties in each nation.

**There already are regional debates.** The issue is that the main parties get far more TV time due to the fact they appear in both the UK and Regional debate. The Solution is to not broadcast the UK (English) debate in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but instead broadcast the 'regional' debates at the same time, on BBC Wales, BBC Scotland, BBC Northern Ireland.

&gt; The Solution is to not broadcast the UK (English) debate in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but instead broadcast the 'regional' debates at the same time, on BBC Wales, BBC Scotland, BBC Northern Ireland.

I disagree. I think that both the UK debates and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish debates shouldn't clash and should be freely accessible to all.

For those of you saying that he clearly has the quality, well we haven't seen it in a Liverpool shirt, and his finishing this season, especially in the prem, has been lackluster. Put Studge, hell even Borini, and you would've seen a couple more goals. 

Underrated: Moreno and Allen. 

- Allen is constantly criticized for the things he's not - he's an incredibly limited player, granted, but the things he does, he does extremely well. Last year we'd bring him on at half time and he'd completely change games by his ability to win back position, and then recycle it and start attacking moves. He has bad games, but I feel the vast majority of criticism directed at him are from people who don't understand his role in the team, and what Rodger's wants him to do. 

- I really rate Moreno. I think he's got a good fundamental defensive basis, and is already quite decent going forward. I love his movement, and I think he will become the quintessential modern fullback. He's young, he's adapting to a new league, and all we've seen are flashes of his potential this season. The vast majority of things he needs to improve on, are things that I see coming through experience and game time. 

Overrated in the League: Couldn't pick one. Don't agree with your Wilshere one though, he gets more flack than he deserves, and puts in a good shift when he's healthy. People just don't like his attitude so they criticize his performance as well, which they shouldn't.

If he got into a scrap with Mark Noble, Noble would knock his block off. He also has a tendency to position himself poorly in his own box. Those 2 things keep him from being a top cb, because going forward he's an excellent passer and header of the ball. Defensively he's a good shot blocker and he's fairly quick.

null,false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,null,"&gt; I'm not sure how this is true.

Employment Rights Act 1996 meant that people were required to have longer notice before dismissal, redundancy money and could only be fired for certain reasons after six months. Unsurprisingly temp work rose after this, as did six month long employment as once you had someone there longer they were extremely hard and expensive to get rid of. 

National Minimum Wage Act 1998 led to the start of the zero hours culture where it was no longer cost-effective for unskilled labour employers to have as many staff working. Burger King were even sued for operating an on-call system where staff were required to be available to work but work wasn't guaranteed. 

Transfer of Undertakings Regulations 2006 meant that contract conditions couldn't be amended negatively which meant that many employers opted to force staff that would have previously been employed to work as self-employed contractors instead. 

I'm sure that there are plenty of other examples but these were the ones that I recall first hand experience of as and when they happened. 

&gt; Furthermore, if the Union movement had not been hamstrung there is no way that such conditions would have been easily brought in.

Pointless conjecture. We wouldn't have the economy we have now if the Union movement hadn't been hamstrung, we'd be more like Spain or even worse.

on joe allen again, i said it above, our best midfield trio last year was when we played that spurs game with hendo lucas allen. interchanging, high press, high energy, fluid...they did wonders, so i think that is the benefit to joe allen, he fits that mould and can offer something different",null,0,null,1421265778,null,0,false,0,cnp00lm,null,t3_2sf84j,null,t1_cnp00lm,null,t1_cnow920,null,null,null,1424876578,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

It is basically a costume drama in the first place, so even before you get into the monster of the week, creating the home period is going to be relatively expensive (and you can guarantee that it wouldn't have the same budget as DW itself), then there is the extensive amount of make-up for two of the main characters - also expensive every week.  

Then, if they were going to make any attempt to keep in continuity with DW, then you've got to think that most of the monsters would have to be fairly small-scale so that they don't knock the Victorian time-line too far out of joint, or be things that you'd expect to show up in the historical records etc. So certainly no Cyber-Kings or equivalent.  

The alternative to this, would either to have some kind of self-contained arc similar to the cracks, whereby the timeline would be wiped clean at the very end, or send them into some other parallel world or something where the timeline can be played with as much as you like, or move them somewhen else rather than Victorian London.  

Assuming that you can get around those issues though, I'd enjoy seeing something more of the Trickster from SJA, and would love some conflict with the early Doctor hunting Torchwood Institute.  

Some steam-punky robots; a trip to the Moon or Mars a la Jules Verne; a Wellsian Martian invasion (and I do have an outline for something along those lines); something involving railways and other such wonders of the modern age I guess.  

However, when it comes to Wells and Verne etc, I really am a little cautious of taking away from their imagination and creativity by suggesting that all of their ideas were actually inspired by thing that had really happened. This has been done in DW a few times in the past and does the original historical characters a dis-service.

He's played in the league and has shown that he could hold his own and would need no adjustment. 

As far as his characteristics go, I think you're completely right. His energy allows him to press well, can make a great pass here and there, plus I think his distribution can be a key part in our plan. It helps relieve pressure and spread the team out. And yes! Loyalty is completely overlooked nowadays. He could easily leave for a team and be a starter (sure it would be a step down), but you don't hear him grumble about needing more playing time and whatnot.

Attempting to theorise where we'd be now if the movement hadn't been destroyed is a futile exercise as it is impossible to say. Also, the Union movement followed the same principle of over-protection for workers as New Labour and in an increasingly globalising marketplace would probably have supported the protections that led to many workers being worse off in practice and suggested extending them further to worse results. 

&gt; So what you're arguing is that employers, especially corporate employers, will do their level best to disadvantage their employees wherever possible.

No. What I'm arguing is that employers, especially corporate employers will do their level best to protect themselves from risk wherever possible.

&gt; If the laws are tightened then they'll be ever more devious in trying to circumvent them.

Pretty much.

&gt; If the laws are relaxed surely they'll just openly abuse their employees?

&gt;You haven't even attempted to address it further than ""the Free Market will surely make it cheaper somehow"".

Not being a rocket scientist I am unsure how to provided you with an answer that is more to your liking, you seem to be ignoring what the evidence I have presented you with suggests. However I will again point to what Space X has to already achieved and what they plan to [Here](http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/?no-ist) and the fact that multiples space agencies made up of the brightest people on earth are investing in SBSP.

&gt;You realise that advanced long-run technologies that will become feasible in coming decades or centuries depend on civilisation lasting that long, right?

Yeah you mentioned this before....... so should I bother going to work tomorrow if things are looking that bad? 

&gt;Here's a wild idea: if world energy demand rises according to your prediction, why not roll out solar power stations across 3% of the world's deserts?

Sounds a good plan to me, one does not displace the other you realise? in fact both have a intertwined relationship to some degree in my mind.

I've come across this type of insular community which tries to impose its own laws, in places like Sheffield and Rotherham.

In general, the way they work is to put huge pressure on members of the community not to involve the police or the State, but instead to settle differences within the community ""the traditional way"". As the community tries very hard not to air its dirty laundry, the fact that their ""laws"" may not mirror State law is of limited consequence.

The problem is that this type of segregation of legal power and justice attacks the very foundation of a civil society.

The other, rather modern, problem is that the State itself, dare not interfere for fear of being perceived as racist - this appears to have been a major contributor to the organised child abuse in places like Rotherham.",null,0,null,1421270766,null,0,false,0,cnp3a8f,null,t3_2se61f,null,t1_cnp3a8f,null,t1_cnp2d7u,null,null,null,1424875054,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

the-londerer, i think you put more emphasis on what i think is borini's biggest shortcoming, he doens't always play with his brain. if he presses, takes the ball off a cb, i don't just back him to score or find the right pass, i guarantee he will put it away...he's assassin borini afterall...but all joking aside, that's not always a gimme with strikers. anybody not named ronaldo, messi, ibra or suarez probably has a 50% strike rate on chances like that, and i would back borini to at least make the right decision and barring a world class save or work done by the keeper to cut off the angle, think he would score. anyways borini has been a flop in the sense that he hasn't lived up to the hype that surrounded him coming in, but i think he is young enough to still become a decent player, he's a hard working and good lad, he's a professional and he seems to relish the idea of proving people wrong. i want more players like that at liverpool who have something to prove than established players who are looking to just earn a paycheck.

&gt;I don't know how Ed Miliband could represent and lead our country. Every morning I watch the previous days' parliament TV and I see him debating etc and he's good - with his notes, at least, not with responses. Similarly, his performance in formal debates is good, too.

Well, I kind of think you've answered your own point here. He's not necessarily good at the 'off-the-cuff' stuff, but his heart's in the right place. He's also extremely intelligent: He knows policy inside-out and first made his name within the party by running a campaign to win a 'hopeless' seat in Scotland. Guy's good.

&gt;I'm unsure about their economic policy

The essence of it is this: They'll cut day-to-day spending but continue to borrow for infrastructure which is how they'll

&gt;fulfil their promise of 240,000 houses built

The idea is that the increased revenue from building decent infrastructure will allow them to cut day-to-day spending and decrease the deficit without punishing the poor and destroying frontline services. This is in contrast with the Coaliton approach, which tears away support while making more people need more support.

&gt;I think I lack security and trust in the party, if that makes sense - ""will they actually deliver? are they capable?""

This is a fair doubt. However, after five years of the current government, we need a new approach - I think you already agree with this, given your newfound antipathy towards the Lib Dems. The last time Labour were in power, they delivered on their promises - no income tax rises, better public services, a minimum wage. They were far from perfect (everyone from activists like me to Ed Miliband himself agrees) but they delivered where it mattered.

&gt;I am generally rather liberal and believe their should be much, much less financial inequality and the richest in society to be taxed a lot more than they are at present.

Labour will raise the top rate of income tax to 50%, introduce a Mansion Tax and cut VAT to rebalance the tax burden toward the rich. This should help address some aspects of inequality, as will raising the minimum wage and encouraging the Living Wage (some Labour councils won't grant planning permission to any business unless they promise to pay a Living Wage to their employees, which is just one way that the Labour Government could help redress inequality in Britain).

&gt;Major issues which concern me are LBGTQ+ rights and mental health

Labour supported the introduction of gay marriage and were striking Section 28 (banning the 'promotion' of homsexuality in schools) off the books while Cameron was campaigning to keep it on there (seriously). Also, Labour legalised homosexual sex in the first place (I mean, it was a whole ago, but we did it!). Labour's plans for the NHS include integrating health and social care, which will particularly benefit the elderly and people with chronic health problems, including mental health ones. Again, this is something Labour councils have been trialling that can hopefully be 'scaled-up' to a nationwide level.

&gt;creating a better society, not a better state

Whoa there, you're starting to sound like a focus group!

&gt;can you summarise Labour's plan regarding immigration + asylum seekers?

RE: Asylum seekers: The UK has to accept people seeking asylum. It'd be a violation of international law not to do so.

On immigration, Labour think immigration is basically good and are going to work to stop employers from exploiting immigrants by properly enforcing the minimum wage, making it illegal for agencies to advertise exclusively for workers overbroad and make it illegal for employers to undercut wages by hiring agency workers. They're also going to try and prevent 'benefit tourism' (which, by the way, doesn't happen, but unfortunately too many voters think it does and refuse to be convinced otherwise) by stopping people claiming some types of benefits until they've been here for six months.

null,false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,null,"what worries you about the squad at the moment? i'm always curious to hear what other fans are feeling/thinking. 

personally, i feel very good about the squad, albeit a young one. this year is clearly one that rodgers views as an educational one, where there will inevitably be growing pains. we will lose our captain, an influential legend at that, may lose toure and could potentially have skrtel or lambert as our senior most squad members. Our average age next season, barring any purchases stands to be one of the youngest in the league and by far the youngest out of the top 8 (currently). 

I see lots of promise in sterling, marko, can, moreno, manq, coutinho, sturridge, origi, tex, ilori, wisdom, ibe, hendo, sahko, lovren, even balo, lallana, flanno, rossiter, ojo, sinclair (academy players i need to be careful with, maybe 1 or 2 of those kids will make it), and lovren even...lovren just can't play much worse than he has. i'm hoping some time out of the firing line has done him a world of good. In addition to all of these talented youngsters, we have a bright, young coach, a stable ownership group that is making positive changes to anfield and the liverpool community. our revenues are set to grow by 20m per season from ticket sales alone. add 5m to the naming rights for the main stand, plus multiple corporate partnerships a la dunkin donus, garuda indonesia, vauxhall, and our preseason tours and we are looking likely to increase our annual revenue by at least i would say 30m by 2016. hopefully by that point we will reach cl, and also collect increased revenues there. 

throw on top of that we are in the semis of league cup, have a legit shout at making a run in the cup (i think we will at least get past bolton and maybe go 1 or 2 more rounds depending on the draw, are still gaining valuable experience by playing in europe (glad we got a tough draw in bestikas to start, sets our expectations of competition high and we will not underestimate a single opponent) and only 7 points off of 4th place. we still have to play every team that sits ahead of us in the table and the squad is gaining an identity without our best player, DS15. i think we have a lot to be positive about, and i would say that there should be a lot of guarded optimism with liverpool fans. we should be positive about all of these things and optimistic that we have chances to do well in our comps, but should not be destroyed if we do not win every cup or game. we will surely experience some setbacks, but if this team can grow up quickly, and all together, i think we are really onto something for 2015-2016. at that point, it might be a matter of actually only having to go out and by 1-2 world class players to fill maybe a gk and cm position. 

anyways don't worry too much, at the end of the day ""some people say that football is a matter of life and death. i assure you, it is far more serious than that.""",null,0,null,1421271579,null,0,false,0,cnp3t46,null,t3_2sexch,null,t1_cnp3t46,null,t1_cnp0jf9,null,null,null,1424874750,null,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2,null

It's well known that a large number of computing teachers are not qualified for a variety of reasons - it's a subject that's only recently been taken seriously. There seems to have been an attitude of replacing IT teachers with anyone spare, regardless of their experience, because anyone can use a computer, right?

Not to mention, computing is a broad area and is often misunderstood. I've met undergraduates who enrolled in computer science because they were pushed that way by parents who saw them playing games or chatting on facebook all day, with no actual interest in the subject. Or those who regretted wasting time with A level computing hoping to write some code.

Fortunately changes are being made, with Computer Science as an A level, upskilling of staff and new generations of teachers.

The Royal Society published a report in 2012, slightly dated now but contains many relevant points regarding the issues we have with computing in schools: https://royalsociety.org/education/policy/computing-in-schools/report/

Further to this, creating a party that doesn't exist in Ireland, who's purpose is to dissolve the country's sovereignty, is just trolling, there is no merit to it. If English redditors want to set up the Dragon-Rapist Party in the MHOC and declare war on sexy dragons, that's fine, but why try to fuck about with another country?

In the end it was resolving into all the far right members of the MHOC using the sub to simply insult a country. 

I know you might not agree, but the intention of the sub isn't to play out some odd anti-Irish fantasy, it's to have fun and let people learn about the Irish political system.

If you want, why don't you set up a Model Israel Parliament, ban Judaism, and declare the Nazi party as overlords.

I've given up on LOTR and gone back to **Bram Stoker's *Dracula's Guest*,** a collection of sometimes horrific, sometimes dull short stories by the great man. Can't really find a good description, but it's free everywhere electronically, so just get it, read the cat story (OMG) and discard the rest if you cannot be arsed. 

Next up, **Thomas Kenneally, [The Daughters of Mars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17164599-the-daughters-of-mars):**

*In 1915, two spirited Australian sisters join the war effort as nurses, escaping the confines of their father’s farm and carrying a guilty secret with them. Used to tending the sick as they are, nothing could have prepared them for what they confront, first near Gallipoli, then on the Western Front.*

*Yet amid the carnage, Naomi and Sally Durance become the friends they never were at home and find themselves courageous in the face of extreme danger, as well as the hostility they encounter from some on their own side. There is great bravery, humor, and compassion, too, and the inspiring example of the remarkable women they serve alongside. In France, where Naomi nurses in a hospital set up by the eccentric Lady Tarlton while Sally works in a casualty clearing station, each meets an exceptional man: the kind of men for whom they might give up some of their precious independence — if only they all survive.*

*At once vast in scope and extraordinarily intimate, The Daughters of Mars brings World War I to vivid, concrete life from an unusual perspective. A searing and profoundly moving tale, it pays tribute to men and women of extraordinary moral resilience, even in the face of the incomprehensible horrors of modern war.*

&gt;**Israel, Palestine and the Quartet**
    

&gt;Greens have long stood against a number of policies of
the Israeli state and continue to call for a just and peaceful
settlement in the Middle East, recognising the rights of the
Palestinian people as well as those of Israelis in a way that
is both fair and humane. An equitable choice needs to be
made and accepted by both Israelis and Palestinians: the
right to security for Israeli citizens should be considered
alongside the rights of Palestinians, including refugees.
   
   

&gt;Green MEPs will push the EU to use its role as a part of
the Middle East Quartet to encourage full respect for
UN mandates relating to the rights of Palestinians, and
to call upon the state of Israel to negotiate with the
democratically-elected government of the Palestinian
people, end collective punishment of Palestinians, including
arbitrary ‘administrative detention’, end illegal occupation of
Palestinian land, and to ensure that Palestinians have access
to water and other amenities, including right of access to
their own farm land. We also call on the democratically elected
representatives of the Palestinian people to
recognise the right of the state of Israel to exist within
recognised, agreed and secure borders.
   
   
&gt;Green MEPs also call upon the European Union to ensure
that agreements of Association with Israel are suspended
unless and until an undertaking is secured that the state
of Israel will enter into the dialogue called for above, and
ensures that the human rights of Palestinians are assured as
are those of Israelis.",null,0,null,1421273160,null,0,false,0,cnp4sxy,null,t3_2sf5ql,null,t1_cnp4sxy,null,t1_cnp1jj3,null,null,null,1424874287,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

So they end up either raising them or putting them into foster care. 

Some of those children grow up to not necessarily be good people/productive members of society because of genetic flaws, systematic abuse or poor life choices or what have you. 

I work at a place that basically sees a result of people who shouldn't have kids due to abusive tendencies, mental illness, mental retardation, being paedophiles or in some cases all of the above. These people then inherit these traits hereditarily (sp?) or just have it beaten/raped into them. Some of them kill themselves, some end up institutionalised in secure services or prison or some just lead fucking miserable lives, all because two people had a baby when they shouldn't have.

Now imagine if we actively discouraged people with those character traits from having children, of their own will. The world would be a better place. I'm not a fascist, I'm not saying we round them all up or whatever. But we could run adverts on the radio or tv or in job centres etc just food for thought.

Come to think of it I've read something vaguely similar to what I'm saying when I was reading up on the Mental Health Act

http://autonomy.essex.ac.uk/best-interests-decision-making-under-the-mental-capacity-act

Section 2, sub section 2.3

&gt;2.3         The abolition of parens patriae and the birth of the inherent jurisdiction

&gt;It was generally accepted by the judges that the High Court has an inherent jurisdiction to make declarations with regard to the lawfulness of certain conducts that are proposed to the Court (e.g. the sterilisation of a mentally handicapped woman in the present case). The House of Lords derived the lawfulness of the proposed medical intervention from the common law principle of necessity. Similarly to an accident where it is necessary to administer medical treatment to non-consenting or unconscious victims, the necessity principle makes intervention lawful in the case of incapacitated adults as long as it serves their best interests or, more precisely, if the acting person ‘adopts the course which, to the judgment of a wise and prudent man, is apparently the best for the interest of the persons for whom he acts in a given emergency’.[31] It is important to emphasise that a proposed act does not become lawful because the court has given its consent; rather, it is ‘lawful [...] because and by virtue of the operation of the doctrine of necessity’.[32]


But instead of acting on the best interest of the person, I'm talking about the greater good.

&gt;

&gt;On 19 April, four days after the disaster, [Kelvin MacKenzie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_MacKenzie), editor of *[The Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom\))*, a British [red-top tabloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_(newspaper_format\)#Red_top_tabloids) newspaper with national distribution owned by [Rupert Murdoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch), used ""THE TRUTH"" as the front page headline, followed by three sub-headlines: ""Some fans picked pockets of victims"", ""Some fans urinated on the brave cops"" and ""Some fans beat up [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable) giving [kiss of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_respiration)"".

&gt;The newspaper cited the words of unnamed police officers and [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK\)) [MP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament) for Sheffield Hallam Irvine Patnick for information relating to the alleged incidents.   *The Daily Express* also carried Patnick's version, under the headline ""Police Accuse Drunken Fans"" and giving Patnick's views, saying he had told Margaret Thatcher, while escorting her on a tour of the ground after the disaster, of the ""mayhem caused by drunks"" and that policemen told him they were ""hampered, harassed, punched and kicked"". 

&gt;The story accompanying the *Sun* headlines claimed ""drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims"" and ""police officers, firemen and ambulance crew were punched, kicked and urinated upon"". A quotation, attributed to an unnamed policeman, claimed a dead girl had been ""abused"", and that Liverpool fans were ""openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead"".  These allegations contradicted the behaviour of many Liverpool fans, who helped security personnel stretcher away a large number of victims and gave first aid to many of the injured.
