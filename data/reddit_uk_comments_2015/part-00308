Didn't suggest that we should.

&gt; I think we have done quite good business this period. Cleverley is an amazing signing on a free and Geri could have cost a lot more as well. We did business worth way more than we spent and got in cover for the players who regularly get injured. I think that's great stuff. 

I think it's been decent as well. Clev looks promising if played correctly and Gerri should be great if he gets over his injury situation. Two players in isn't cover though, especially when ones a CM where we're already stacked.

&gt; Additionally, three positions were addressed. Three people will be coming in. Maybe also Lennon as a fourth if we get him on the cheap.

You dont know that and neither do I. We could sign no players as easily as we could get 3 especially when our previous targets have chosen West Ham and Stoke before us.

&gt; Patience.

It's hard to have when it's late in the transfer window. The better players have already gone and transfer deadline day is increasingly becoming more and more likely to be the time we sign players as they become available.

&gt; And you are obviously right that not everything needs to be spun positively but do you really want to say that our recruitment has been bad? 

Not bad but nowhere near enough.

&gt; Given the circumstance that our team itself did not need all too much addressing in the first place but a bit more cover and some patching up here and there, and you can easily see a pattern here.

I think it needed/needs more than you think in my opinion. Every other teams first XI (sans Chelsea) has improved apart from us.

For values under £10k the judge just needs paperwork and will decide for themselves, as far as I'm aware, and only actually goes to trial when you have a major dispute/unclear problem. 

I would recommend writing a scathing, but honest and not rude, email/letter to the landlord, stating everything clearly, his claims and your disputes, with emails about rent being paid and a police report about damages during the burglary, to the landlord, and make it clear that he'll lose, it'll cost him more and take ages if he doesn't just settle and leave you alone.


I have written:
&gt; ""I am looking into the simplest way to reclaim this money for all of us, short of contacting small claims court which, having successfully taken landlords through before, I know is a massive pain for all involved, and I'm sure we'd rather all avoid this. ""

It rarely happens and is [only done when the committee believes the appeal never had a chance of succeeding](http://playtheadvantage.com/2014/02/06/what-a-red-card-appeal-really-means-part-one/). The extension rule is basically to prevent clubs from abusing the appeal system or making political statements about cards they think were wrong without any reprimand.

There is enough debate in the incident to warrant a look. I think a red card was the correct decision for the referee to make since it was in the box and Courtois was the last man but Chelsea could argue that the card is enough of a punishment considering how marginally this is a ""clear goalscoring opportunity"". When you look at the replays in slow-mo (which the ref can't do in the moment so fair enough) its not like Gomis had a brilliant first touch. He pushes the ball wider than he should have before Courtois touches him so he would have had to take at least a few more steps wide, turn himself to goal and settle himself before shooting. All the while his angle to work with decreases and he still has to beat Cahill who is very good at covering. Gomis **definitely** could have put it away but the red card and subsequent suspension isn't for 'a decent chance of scoring' its for a CLEAR goal scoring opportunity and that's Hasley's point. There are enough variables in this incident to make a committee think it over. 

Anyway at the end of the day Begovic is a fantastic backup and thats why we signed him. Someone also pointed out that T-bo may have a minor injury from Saturday's warm up which is a good point too but assuming he's fully fit and there is little risk in appealing it's surely worth it right? Courtois is better than Begovic no matter how good a backup he is! :)

Here is the gif of the incident for those that want to see Gomis' touch. It's particularly sideways so he couldn't recollect it and go towards goal still, he would have had to turn back a bit in my opinion.

The chancellor will face “real anger and frustration” over the changes, which hit “the very people we ought to be supporting” according to Tory MPs. 

They also worry that the changes will be a disincentive to work after years of promises to make work pay. Mainstream Conservative MPs are sounding the alarm for the first time today over the scale and suddenness of the cuts.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that 13 million families will lose an average of £240 a year, and three million families will lose £1,000 a year.

Mr Osborne’s changes dwarf those that led to the 10p tax row of 2008, when Gordon Brown’s government was thrown into crisis over plans to remove a pound a week from 1.3 million people and £232 from the worst affected.

Mr Osborne has enjoyed soaring popularity thanks to the election result and last month’s budget. However, two formerly loyal Tory MPs from the 2010 intake are leading the charge, warning him not to abandon those in work who earn low salaries and were promised protection in the election campaign.

With Labour also opposed to the tax credit changes, a Tory rebellion could be a big problem for the government.

Andrew Percy, the Tory MP for Brigg &amp; Goole, told The Times that Mr Osborne needed to be careful and that more protection was needed for the poorest.

“We need to be very careful when making changes to the tax credits of those already in the system that those changes are tapered and offer protection to those affected. 

“Many of these people are doing exactly what the government has asked them to do, get up in the morning and go to work. 

“Not everyone has either the skill base, or necessarily lives in the right area, to be able to just go and get a better-paid job. The changes to the minimum wage and personal tax allowances will help many, but not all, of those on low wages affected by tax credit changes. Change is needed, but in the process we mustn’t end up harming those who are trying their best and working hard.”

Guto Bebb, the MP for Aberconwy, warned that the increase to the minimum wage, and Mr Osborne’s introduction of the national living wage, would not do enough. 

“Whilst the introduction of a national living wage was rightly lauded the changes to tax credits have been somewhat under-scrutinised. The changes are both eye-wateringly painful to those affected, but also reverse a key policy platform of the last five years — namely, making work pay.”

He said the changes meant that the tax credit system and universal credit would remove the incentive to work. 

“During the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill we rightly highlighted the reduction in marginal deduction rates [which determine how much employees keep when their salary rises] from 94p in the pound to 74p in the pound.

“We now see the situation reversed with a marginal deduction rate of well over 80 per cent proposed for many who took our advice and sought a job . . . With such a marginal tax rate kicking in so early on the income scale, it’s difficult to see how any worker will be able to make up their losses. Come April there will be some real anger and frustration out there amongst the very people we ought to be supporting.”

Obviously we paid big money for Benteke and Firmino, and that in itself shouldn't make us use them, but we paid it because we believed they were worth it, and that should mean something.

Coutinho and Sturridge have both excelled here, and they should probably be the last 2 to be dropped.

Henderson is that captain, and it may undermine his leadership of the team if he's being left out of the starting XI. Clearly, he's in Rodger's plans.

Milner wouldn't have come here if he wasn't going to play either. I don't think we'll see him dropped from the regular starters.

null,null,HolySheesh,null,null,null,"I haven't flown with Monarch, but I can give some advice on flying with budget airlines.

Firstly, check if you can check in online 24 hours before departure. That will save some hassle, you just need a printer so that you can print your boarding passes.
 
If you are travelling with luggage you will need to find the Monarch desk at the airport. These are always near the front entrance and as Manchester is quite small it won't be hard to find. Once there you queue. You can check in there as well but most people will just be dropping of their luggage. You will need your boarding pass and passport, they will put your bag onto the belt and you'll be done.

Afterwards you will pass on to security. You can only take up to 5 (I believe) liquid containers and they each have to be a maximum of 100ml. You will need to have these liquids in a small, see-through plastic bag which can be provided at the airport. 

You will then queue for security. You will be given a box to put your items in. In said box you will put your liquids, laptop/iPad, jacket/coat (if you're wearing one) and anything in your pockets including your passport. This will move on through a scanning machine and when you're doing so you will go through a scanning machine as well. You might have to take off your shoes. If everything goes OK you pass onto the next stage but if you something beeps then you will get patted down by a male member of staff, and you might need to have to go into a tube like thing that gives you another full body scan. The staff will instruct you. This is more rare but if something looks odd in your bag a member of staff might take it out and get you to unpack and show them.

Once you've passed through security you'll be in the waiting lounge. Manchester will only be small but there will be a duty free shop as well as a couple of others and maybe some cafes/restaurants. 

You will wait until your flight gets announced a gate. Watch the screens. It will say ""Flight {your number} to {your destination}-Gate information at {a time about 45 minutes before take off}"".

null,null,Everton_11,crest,Bill's Brown Bomber,null,"This is a very solid piece of analysis. Apart from his play, I think there are several other considerations that need to be taken into account, on the contract negotiations side of this move. 

We know Inter want Shaqiri off of their books, and we know that Shaqiri's not happy at Inter. We've seen him both at the Britannia, and he was supposedly at Goodison against Watford. Prior to appearances at both parks, Shaqiri has been linked primarily to Everton and Stoke. 

It can reasonably be inferred that we are/were the two teams who have a reasonable shot at landing him. Now Shaqiri is having a medical at Stoke, implying he's basically signed. Fine.

The real question that needs to be asked is: why did he go to Stoke?  Obviously, some of you feel that it's because the board are too cheap, not ambitious enough, absolute rubbish, whatever. I disagree. There are several reason Shaqiri may have chosen Stoke over Everton.

1: Stoke do not have an obvious number ten, and Shaqiri cannot reasonably expect to displace Barkley.

2: As an addendum to #1, of any of the front three, I don't see Shaqiri as an obvious upgrade.

3: As pointed out above, Shaqiri doesn't really fit into a complex, passing-oriented gameplan, which we play, for better or for worse.

4: As also pointed out above, Shaqiri has some attitude issues, and we know that Martinez absolutely, point-blank refuses to bring in players that he feels will not fit mentally with the squad, which I agree with.

5: Stoke actually have significant money to throw at players, given that they're backed by a chairman worth approximately three-quarters of a billion sterling, who's also a massive fan of his club. Our chairman, while also a massive Evertonian, in a good year, is worth somewhere between four and five percent of Stoke's. Say what you will about the board, Stoke have more money they can throw at a player.

I have seen unconfirmed reports that Inter are not the only selling club. Apparently, some of the terms included in his move to Inter from Bayern leave Bayern with some sort of hand in a move away from Inter. So, it's possible he's not going to end up at Stoke. Apparently Newcastle are also in for him.

I'm fine not signing Shaqiri, but I would have liked to have gotten Payet, doubly so after that game against Arsenal yesterday. Unfortunately, there's a fair of wealthy chairman over at Upton Park these days, too.

null,null,ke_0z,,AustrianVillan,null,"I posted this about 2 months ago when someone started a similar thread, so here we go again...

As an Austrian who is also a supporter of Rapid Vienna, I first came to know Aston Villa when Rapid kicked them out twice (2009 and 2010) of UEFA Europa League qualification. Although I was of course happy at the time that Rapid beat Villa, I immediately took a liking in Aston Villa because just like Rapid Vienna, Villa is also a club with a long tradition and passionate fans.

Nevertheless, I didn't start to actively follow Aston Villa until last season of the Premier League. That was mainly because I just didn't watch Premier League games until last year. Besides the earlier contact I made with Aston Villa and my general appreciation of old traditional clubs, there are several other reasons I started supporting AVFC.

As an avid Heavy Metal fan, I naturally came across Birmingham, as it is the city known as the birthplace of Heavy Metal, with bands like the mighty Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Led Zeppelin coming from Birmingham. Once I read that Ozzy Osbourne is a Villa supporter, which also led me to like this club. Moreover, Barney Greenway, the vocalist of Napalm Death, another Birmingham-based band that I love, also said in interview that he is an Aston Villa fan. So as you can see, my taste in music heavily influenced my choice of which English football club to support.

Furthermore, I remember that my mother once visited Birmingham, and when she came back (I was maybe 5 years old then), she told my how much she liked it there. This was more or less the first time someone told me about an English city in detail (well, other than London maybe), so it stuck with me (still have to visit Birmingham myself, though!).

Additionally, Aston Villa was the club that featured (past tense, now that he's gone) most in Austrian press (well, besides the internationally playing clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal, Man City etc.), because of Andreas Weimann (who was a youth player at Rapid Vienna btw!). Having an Austrian playing in the Premier League is something special for us here and at that time, he was the only one (now Marko Arnautovic is playing at Stoke City, Christian Fuchs at Leicester City, Kevin Wimmer at Tottenham and Sebastian Prödl at Watford). Unfortunately, Weimann left Villa, but let's hope he has a good season with Derby and helps them to achieve promotion!

Tenants can contest a fee for cleaning costs if it doesn't seem fair. But usually landlords have contacts / agencies that mean they can access much cheaper cleans, so it's often better to let them take a small fee rather than forking out for say, a £300 professional clean.

Honestly the biggest bottleneck at a club bar is the customers taking far too long to do everything. If you are at the bar with your money in your hand and your order ready, I can probably serve you about 10 drinks and be done with you in under a minute. Takes me seconds to grab a few cans or pour a few mixed drinks and get your change. If everyone was prepared this wouldn't really be a problem.

Everywhere I have worked as a bartender has this problem. Customers stand at the bar not paying attention to me, order 1 drink at a time, call their mates over to ask them what they wanted again, get confused about what I've already given them, get their drinks wrong, complains about the prices, fumbles with their wallet, doesn't have enough money, calls their mate back over to borrow a fiver, etc fucking etc. Then other customers will moan at ME because they've had to wait. Moan at that fucker taking 5 minutes of my time because he's an idiot who has no self-awareness of the time he's wasting. Obviously there are shitty bartenders out there, but most of the problem comes from the customer.

null,null,EmilioRebenga,null,null,null,"Firstly, since it is a contentious issue as mentioned the bias is present even without getting further insight than the Lib Dems with the massive over representation of the smaller left parties and the almost halved right wing major parties.

So on a personal point of view to reply to your question:
I actually really like the Lib Dems, I think the whole student fees was blown a bit out of proportion personally so this is by no means a criticism of them to say I think they are slightly left.

The ""mansion tax"" labour spoke of the lib dems have the same. A high value property tax which is virtually the same and I would argue isn't really a right wing policy.  I'm also not in favour of it because I don't think we should tax people just because they have money, it needs to be a bit more sophisticated than that. 

They aren't really in line with a right wing austerity measure - more money for policing, education and environmental legislation (too many to list unless you want an essay for a reply but it is easy enough to find out the many ideas they have on this.)

I think a few of these things are good ideas but I would say they are generally, left wing. 
Increasing paternity leave, capital gains, corporation taxes on banks and business, increased amounts you would get on UC.

A lot of these changes go against individual responsibility and small government which go hand in hand with a right wing government. Clearly it is a spectrum and never black or white, but I see very few right wing policies and more left. Infact I actually havn't seen many right wing policies at all. Of course, and if you want to disagree I'd welcome that discussion because it is evident that the left or right wing discussion on the Lib dems is far from factual, set in stone and what I said is largely my own personal opinion rather than anything I would criticise somebody for disagreeing with in any way.

My guess would be that there's a reasonable period of time in which to ask for late fees, not just ""some point after the fact"".

I'd be more worried about your deposit, it sounds like there's no DPS in place, which is required by law. See here: https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-deposit-protection/overview


Back to the rent, however (all this info is from a big letter's contract, so I assume it's kosher, if they're skirting the law, that's not my responsibility. Best bet would be check your own contract, and then if in doubt contact someone who actually knows the law, not me!):

The problem you have is that the LL is totally allowed to charge you late fees, you may however have some luck refuting it on the amount asked for and the time they have asked.

LL is required to send a reminder after 1 week and 2 weeks, along with charges of £35 and £125 respectively, and can remind and charge you for each reminder. They can also charge 6% above BoE base interest on the funds missing.

Now, some of these may be law, and some may be internal practice, but they probably give a good outline of the formalities involved in late fees and the sort of process required.

OP, you'll be flying from Terminal 2, which is the second-largest terminal there (and in my opinion, the nicest!). There are actually lots of shops and cafes/restaurants available, and plenty of seating areas with some great views of the aircraft parking.

If you want some further information, [Manchester Airport's website](http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/) has loads of useful information. There's also [this guide for first-time fliers](http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/flight-information/guides-to-flying/first-time-flyers/) which should answer all your questions.

I'm a huge aviation nerd, private pilot, and regular flyer, and I tend to visit Manchester fairly frequently either to fly or to visit the aviation viewing park nearby, so I'm very familiar with the airport. Happy to answer any further questions, too!

You could end up managing people, integrating products with customers' systems or studying their business requirements so you can build systems to meet those.

If a landlord puts down a new carpet and expects it to last 10 years, then if a tenant ruins the carpet in the period of 5 years and it needs replacing, then the tenant should make a contribution towards half of the carpet cost (note: not for all of the half, but some of), it'd be fair for them to contribute 5 years worth of maintenance costs.

No, contracts *can* have unenforceable terms if they are unfair (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50) or if a judge has previously deemed them to be illegal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law).

null,null,AmerieHartree,,Democracy is the most revolutionary thing in the world,null,"&gt; But as the former law lord Lord Hoffmann has said, [the ECtHR] seems ""unable to resist the temptation to aggrandise its jurisdiction and to impose uniform laws on member states...it considers itself the equivalent of the Supreme Court of the USA, laying down a federal law for Europe."" 

This statement just straight up annoyed me, mainly because of the hyperbole. An attempt at non-uniform application would result in a bizarre system with unworkable case law, the [four ECtHR attempts to lift the UK's ban on prisoner voting](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31356895) shows it is clearly not within the power of the court to impose in such a way anyways, and there are so many serious differences between the ECtHR and SCOTUS that any such equivalence just looks absurd. To purport that the ECtHR considers itself to be passing judgements based on a completely different type of legal document, in a completely different system of law, over a completely different type of political entity is clearly absurd, so the purpose of this statement appears to me to not be to communicate the ECtHR's own opinion of it's role and function, but at best to communicate the flawed opinion of the person speaking, and at worst to scaremonger, and misrepresent the ECtHR and it's powers.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Perhaps the most farcical and cynical aspect of the Council of Europe which gave rise to that Court is that Russia is a member state and has signed up to all the fine words about human rights. I would rather my country was not in such company. 

Guess we better leave the UN and withdraw from the ICC too, then. Aside from the humorous (though false) inference that Tebbit does not want to uphold human rights in this country to the extent they do in Russia, he should perhaps also look at the company we would keep in Europe if we withdrew from the ECHR - namely, Belarus. Either way, it is par for the course that in the international world different countries which may not find each other rather savoury still negotiate and sign treaties, trade with each other, and are members of the same supranational organizations. To pretend this is a serious argument for withdrawal is to be somewhat removed from the political reality. This also puts another nail in the coffin of the conception of the ECtHR as some malevolent, unstoppable, interfering busybody court - We have to obey it as much as Russia does. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; A new injustice has now come from the Appeal Court ruling that the detention of Serdar Mohammed, a suspected Afghan bombmaker [in Afghanistan], for 110 days without charge was illegal under that legislation..  ..It was war, and if the choice was between risking some injustice to a suspected Afghan bomb maker or risking the life of a British soldier, I know which risk I would have taken. However, Sapna Malik, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day which brought the case, called it ""upholding"" the law.

This appears to be [fairly complex](https://www.justsecurity.org/25184/reason-uk-lost-serdar-mohammed-case/) but the crux of the issue appears not to be the ECHR but the differing nature of international humanitarian law when applied to international armed conflicts and non-international armed conflicts (those against state actors, and those against non-state actors) - I am not certain but from my reading it looks like, because there is no specific international body of law for dealing with non-state actors and prisoners in these conflicts (such as the Geneva convention in IACs), they are instead subject to domestic law. Considering the current conflicts in the world it is not surprising that this is an expanding and maybe somewhat underdeveloped part of law. Also, whilst it the overall ruling was based on article 5 of the ECHR, there were numerous other legal failings involved:

&gt; The Justices conclude “even if Article 5 had to be modified to reflect the fact that this detention was in the course of a non-international armed conflict, the minimum procedural safeguards required by international law in such a conflict would not have been met.”

The Justices, as shown in the article, also pointed to a method in which similiar actions could be rendered legal in future, even with the ECHR in place. So, as with many of the cases often quoted to highlight the supposed travesties that happen due to the ECHR (and HRA), once you actually look into the details it is much more nuanced and it is not always the ECHR, but often the activities of governments and other relevant law from which faults arise. Unfortunately he failed to provide the case names for the 'violent foreign sex offenders and other undesirables being granted the right to live in our country on the most absurd grounds', and whilst I'm sure there have been a few egregious errors of judgements at the hands of both the british and european courts regarding these issues, I'm not entirely convinced this presents a reasonable case for removing the HRA or withdrawing from the ECHR.

&amp;nbsp;

Not sure what the point he's making about judicial review is. The article he links is about Chris Grayling making the rules for obtaining a judicial review harder, two years ago, which is completely unrelated to the paragraphs he wrote about judicial review.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Even worse, I doubt if Mr Cameron, who unwisely made himself something of a lame duck prime minister by the premature announcement of his decision to stand down before the next election, will have the authority lead us out of the reach of the Strasbourg Court by renouncing the European Convention. 

So, if I had one point about this article of which I approve, it is the fact that he does not dither about like many in the government pretending that if he remove the HRA alone we won't have to worry about the ECHR/ECtHR, or if we remove the HRA alone it will be handing power in some way back to the British. All removing the HRA would do (aside from possibly causing a raft of constitutional issues) is remove powers from British judges - both to rule on human rights cases, which would go back to Strasbourg (possibly amounting in the waste of government official's time and money), and to issue the (already extremely weak) obligation which British courts can place upon parliament. The idea that the British state, in the modern day, should have a judiciary which is completely unable to restrict (or even declare incompatible) any and all legislation which can be passed through parliament is one I find rather disquieting and quite out of keeping with the norm in other developed countries. However, the idea that a judiciary which can barely do this is 'out of control' - now, I simply find that nonsensical.

null,null,justthisplease,null,null,null,"This is an interesting piece on that topic; 

""The QTM posits that an expansion of the money supply causes inflation because it adds nominal spending growth to a fully employed economy.

The only way the economy could adjust to more spending when it was already at full capacity was to ration that spending off with higher prices. Financial commentators simplify this and say that inflation arises when there is ‘too much money chasing too few goods’.

The main problem with the theory (there are several) is that capitalist economies are rarely operating at full employment. The Classical theory essentially denied the possibility of unemployment.

The fact that economies typically operate with spare productive capacity and often with persistently high rates of unemployment, means that it is hard to maintain the view that there is no scope for firms to expand the supply of real goods and services when there is an increase in total spending growth. If a firm has poor sales and lots of spare productive capacity, why would it hike prices when sales improved?

Thus, if there was an increase in availability of credit and borrowers used the deposits that were created by the loans to purchase goods and services, it is likely that firms with excess capacity will respond by increasing the supply of goods and services to maintain or increase market share rather than push up prices.

In other words, an evaluation of the inflationary consequences of OMF should be made with reference to the state of the economy.

If there is idle capacity then it is most unlikely that OMF will be inflationary. At some point, when unemployment is low and firms are operating at close to or at full capacity, then any further spending, whether funded by OMF or some other scheme, will likely introduce an inflationary risk into the policy deliberations.""

[I will post a comment reply to another post I made to address the age component of your statement.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3ggaqt/results_from_political_party_voting_polls/ctxye9f)

In replying to the comment there about age:

&gt;The evidence actually shows that the bias present within the group is outwith that from what you would see at age alone.

From what you said it makes no real sense on the statistical side of things.

If we have a young demographic here, the Lib Dems should have gone a far lower proportion since their worst voting community was the under 25s. Again, Labour did worse than you would expect. This is at odds with their 18-25 voting statistics. This should have been their best demographic but here we saw that as a number, it was reduced from what you would expect in exactly the area where a positive proportion should have been seen.

There is a far bigger bias than due to age alone and to dismiss the evidence seen as purely because of the age is an assumption, a quick and easy one to make but if you spend time going through the figures it is clear that this is not the case, but is actually just a common myth that has been proven wrong by these 2 sets of polls anyway.


Secondly about the lower middle class, [evidence actually shows that if this was the case](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=wide), **the Tories should still be the most popular party, along with Labour.** NRS social classes are great because they use that exact phrase, "" [lower middle class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRS_social_grade).""

Therefore, despite the reddit demographic what we are seeing is **in excess** of the expected deviations you would see. 

**If this were true the Lib Dems and Greens would be absolutely hammered in the polls. That is clearly not only not true, the total opposite has occurred.**

**Also, UKIP would be disproportionately popular, but they are not.**

Therefore, if you actually look at the voting statistics and the evidence / figures, to answer your question:

No, it is not just proportionate to the demographic that reddit serves. 
And also a big No to the 
&gt;Left wing bias is obviously going to be seen in a website that caters mainly to young, mainly lower-middle class people. 

As the figures I provided show, in the electorate actually the young working class are more right wing than people previously thought, with the Tories and UKIP bulking these areas up and the left wing Green, Lib Dems and Labour getting neglected in these areas. UKIP smashed the working class vote from Labour for their given party size. Labour only did better in the middle class and above, class C1 and above.

**To summarise, a lot of your post is based on assumptions many people make but it is actually, factually, untrue and the stereotype of the left being left wing is possibly exactly what has led to the election results we have seen. That is no longer the case, Labours only really appealing demographic that stands out from any other party is [ethnic minorities, in other areas other parties beat them in each one.](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=wide)**

Btw, please take my reply not as confrontational or dismissing your post I am not, I am just trying to show that all these stereotypes banded about reddit are actually wrong and potentially limiting the discussion we could have.

Running the calculator (see dwair's post) with a pre-tax salary of £80k gives a figure of around £160/wk that you would be due, and it goes down to ~140 if you have the child over with you 1-2 nights a week. So you're paying somewhere in the region of 5x what you're meant to! [E: just seen you got 200/wk, so adjust slightly]

Would you like custody? Or for your daughter to at least stay over with you at the weekend? (sleeping on a couch in the home you pay for is more than a tad insulting, no?). If so I'd guess you need to have somewhere suitable for her.. Do you?

Is it possible she is claiming any benefits? Child benefit? Housing benefit? JSA? ..you didn't say anything about food so I guess she must have *some* other form of income.

If you are able to demonstrate your situation was child oriented (eg; you could be around to get her ready for (the same) school, and available when she comes or soon after) and you were able to demonstrate that, say, your ex were fraudulently claiming housing benefit (by not declaring that you pay the ****ing rent!) or something then I think you could have a very strong case for custody. Without that you might still have a reasonable case with demonstrating her flaws vs you (steady job vs ""i don't want to work"").

Definitely seek proper (legal) advice on this (start at CAB?)-- but even if you find out you would get worse access by going the legal route, you are still in an extremely strong position to improve your situation. For example you could pay £1k/month to have, say, custody every other weekend in addition to visitation on the other weekends. That would be ~£100/wk more than you'd have to pay if you did things through the proper channel, in exchange for the extra weekend access.

Do your best not to let your partner know anything has changed. You may well have to gather evidence that she would otherwise hide. If greater custody is something you want you may wish to spend the next period making your life as suitable for the child to live with you as possible-- get suitable accommodation (pref. so they don't have to change schools), see if you can figure out some flexible working, etc etc. I'd also recommend seeking further advice online first.. /r/MensRights is the only place you could start here I think? I don't have any personal experience with this. You may also want to clue yourself up about negotiation and psychology too.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11792030/Pressure-growing-on-Alan-Yentob-and-fellow-trustees-after-Kids-Company-closure.html

 Its most recent annual report, for 2013, stated that “Kids Company currently supports some 36,000 children, young people and vulnerable adults” across 40 schools and 12 drop-in centres in London and Bristol.

This figure has been widely interpreted as the number of vulnerable children with whom the charity works, providing emotional support, therapy and practical help. However, figures in the same report suggest the actual number is far lower.

Under the heading Why Kids Company Is Needed, it states: “In 2013 we worked with 750 exceptionally vulnerable young people.”

It reinforces the impression that Ms Batmanghelidjh was able to attract a large amount of funding and publicity out of proportion to the actual work carried out by her organisation.

The figure of 36,000 'clients’ included 19,000 children at dozens of schools in London and four in Bristol, with whom Kids Company workers came into contact in some way, along with **7,000** **parents** **or** **family** **members**, some of whom directly benefit from therapy and other support.

But the youngsters in its figures **included** **the** **classmates** **of** **those** **children** **taking** **part** **in** **its** **activities**.

null,null,rumpopumpo,null,null,null,"&gt; Your employer can not make you return to work until your doctor signs you off.

That is unfortunately not true. The employer can challenge a fit note, even without consulting an occupational health professional. From [this pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/183335/fitnote-occupational-health-guide.pdf) on gov.uk:

&gt;Is the advice on the Statement binding on employers?

&gt;No. It is up to the employer after discussing the Statement with
their employee (and if necessary seeking advice from an
occupational health professional), how to act on the doctor’s
advice.

&gt;If the certifying doctor has advised that an employee ‘may be fit
for work’ and the employer cannot make the adaptations or
adjustments to help a return to work, they should use the
Statement as if the doctor had advised ‘not fit for work’. The
employee does not need to go back to their doctor for a new
Statement to confirm this.

&gt;When considering the certifying doctors advice, you should
always consider if the advice is consistent with any industry or
sector specific safety guidelines or regulations that the doctor
may not be aware of. 

Edit: and [this pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/400128/fitnote-employers-line_managers-jan-2015.pdf) advising employers about fit notes:

&gt;Is the fit note binding on me?

&gt;No. The assessment about whether your
employee is not fit for work or may be fit for
work (and any other advice in the fit note) is
classed as advice, and it is for employers to
determine whether or not to accept it. ",null,0,null,1439221771,null,null,1439222069,0,cty1nol,null,t3_3ggv0b,null,null,null,t1_cty1a37,null,null,null,1440394362,null,2,null,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,2,null

Second half, they were told to press and the three of them grabbed the game for the first 10/15 of the second half. 

Not only did Westwood set up the goal with a fantastic driven corner but he actually won it himself with a great ball in, the defender panicked and headed out. Then he was pushed a bit further forward when Sanchez came on and did okay there too.

null,null,somethingdifferent34,null,null,null,"&gt; there's nothing urgent about, it's not going anywhere. Side note with gas prices so low it's a pretty bad time to get into this market actually, in the US with MUCH less regulation they need gas to be at $65, we can only assume it needs to be higher. 

So you are pro-fracking, just not right now? 

It's also worth noting that it's going to be years before commercial-scale production of gas is up and running, and even the least optimistic forecasts of oil/gas prices expect the price to have risen considerably by then.

&gt;We would like have to give very significant subsidies to get off the ground, as it simply isn't going to make money anytime soon.

Tax breaks yes, direct subsidies no. And of course if we don't let this get off the ground, there would be no economic activity to give tax breaks to anyway!

&gt; Our energy supplies are secure (vast majority of imports from Western Europe - especially Norway).

Our gas supply is relatively secure yes, but what about the rest of Europe? New UK gas streams coming online would nicely hedge against Russian influence.

&gt;Economic Growth would be an argument for ANY industry, including renewables.

Economic growth is still a good think though right? Renewables and gas power stations aren't mutually exclusive in any way. In fact quite the opposite: Heavy use of Solar/Wind pretty much dictates that we're *also* going to need to use gas power stations extensively too. 

&gt;Lower Carbon Emissions no where near proven, as there is no definitive studies on this yet, it looks to be about as damaging as coal when you look at end to process...

So you think we should build more coal power stations instead?

Its such an unworthy place to be spending tax money when there is genuinely needy people and awful infrastructure in many parts the UK. 

Fee raising hasn't lowered the amount of people going to university so the 'benefits everyone' argument doesn't make sense, because the workforce would be just as educated if there wasn't fees. 

Also IIRC the new higher fees allowed universities to spend more on their courses increasing the level of education recieved at British universities. I don't see how from a left wing perspective free tuition is justified as it will mainly pay for future Middle and Upper classes degrees.

The wikipedia is also ""okay"" for information on rivalries, different ownership groups, etc.

I guess the biggest points for me personally:

-Millwall is shit. Their fans are cunts, their team is trash and their stadium is a fucking dump. Oh, and they play shit football.

-Tottenham is shit. Their fans are cunts who think too highly of themselves, their owner is a cunt with his head up his own arse, and the entire club is of the belief their shit don't stink. Plus they have a cock and ball on their shirt.

-Bobby Moore is a god and don't you ever forget it. He will go down (alongside Beckenbauer) as the greatest defender to ever play the game. He was a gentleman's gentleman, who captained this club with class and dignity. He also captained England to glory in the 1966 WC, along side fellow Hammers Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.

-Billy Bonds is the greatest transfer we've ever had. We paid £50,000 for him in 1967 and he played 700 games for us and managed the club, to boot. You won't find anyone with a deeper shade of claret and blue running through their veins than Billy Blue Eyes.

-Vic Watson is the club's all-time leading scorer (323). He was a prolific forward during the 20s and 30s and his total may never be matched for the club, due to the nature of transfers in the modern game. The ""modern"" record is held by Geoff Hurst (252).

-The names Dicks, Devonshire, McAvennie, Cottee, Di Canio, Brooking, Martin, Hurst, Peters, Tevez, and Carlton Fucking Cole should all mean something... club legends the lot of them, but this is a club not short on legends.

**EDIT (One other thing):**

-The highest finish West Ham has ever had in the First Division is 3rd, achieved in 1985/86. The starting XI that season went mostly unchanged: Phil Parkes; Ray Stewart, Alvin Martin, Tony Gale, George Parris; Mark Ward, Alan Dickens, Neil Orr, Alan Devonshire; Tony Cottee, Frank McAvennie.

null,null,Sanguin3,null,null,null,"I'm going into my third year of an Informatics degree; here are a few bits of advice:

The best piece of advice that I can give is to attend the Societies' Fair in Freshers week. Have a good look around there and make sure to get info on anything that looks vaguely interesting.

Also, I noticed that you mentioned that pubs and clubs aren't really your scene. This shouldn't really be a problem in terms of meeting lots of new people, as there are absolutely loads of different ways to get to know new people who are in the same situation as yourself - societies, lectures, working in groups for coursework, communal areas in your halls. Hell, I even met one of my best mates in a queue on my first day.

Even being 17 shouldn't be too much of an issue. I wasn't 18 until January of my first year, so I'd already gone a whole semester without being able to drink and whatnot legally. Even on freshers week, most of the drinking establishments let us 17 year-olds in anyway as long as we were students. I don't actually drink myself so I never did find out if I would have been served once inside, but I suspect I would have.

Also, find out where your lectures and labs are going to be located at. If you're studying any sort of science (apart from vetmed), chances are that your lectures will take place around the George Square campus, but your labs, which are several hours long at times, will be situated at the King's Buildings. KB is a good 30-40 mins walk from George Square, but there is a shuttle bus that runs back and forth between the two every 20 mins or so. If you do find that you need to use the bus, get the timetable in advance and find out exactly where it leaves from. Bear in mind, the bus has limited space, and is usually completely full in the morning and especially around 5 o'clock when all the KB students return to their halls near George Square.

If your halls don't have washing facilities, find a decent launderette nearby. Also, never do your weekly food shop around teatime; students all go there after Uni and the shops get really busy then.

TL;DR: Relax, everyone else is in the same boat as you and is just as nervous. It will all be fine and a few weeks in everything will feel completely natural to you.",null,0,null,1439223912,null,null,false,0,cty31on,null,t3_3geksd,null,null,null,t3_3geksd,null,null,null,1440395017,null,2,null,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2,null

As accents can and do change, so do identities. It's not possible to change an identity you are born with (black, white etc..) but it is possible to change how that dictates your perception of your own identity.

It's very time consuming digging through every post to see who wants and has multiple items.

I think if we had a weekly post for everyone to comment what parts they want and have to trade/sell, it could be much more productive.

Like/dislike the idea? Only issue I can think of is having to add a timestamp to your comment, but how hard is that really? Would make it a lot more concise.

In actual fact the people who write these laws have very little knowledge of experience with such things (so eh, score one for the assembly I suppose). There was a spate of murders in England done with katanas and they were banned (ish) in response to that, gangs going crocodile Dundee on each other until people started using swords.

There is a mythos around katanas, mostly fueled by film and legends of bullets being cut in half so they were the obvious choice if you're going to buy a sword.

Really though in comparison to European swords of the time they're not great, but that's mostly to do with the inferior steel, which had to be folded hundreds of times to get it hard enough, by banning cheap reproductions they priced out hoods and at the same time banned good swords.

I then twigged not only did I enjoy finding out how the world worked but I was good at science. So then I went to Warwick Uni, got my undefraduate and PhD in physics, and that's what I do now - semiconductor research at Cambridge. 

But it wasn't until I started my PhD that I actually really liked computing too. I started to build computers and code, ultimately using Linux for both work and leisure.  I still code for work, I still use Linux for both work and as a hobby.   

On the computing front I'd say that you should consider what you like about computing - is it the novelty as this is all new to you or making something so something? If it is the novelty then beware - novelty wears off VERY quickly. I've seen it happen with friends. Some went to uni to do computer science, got very good, well paid jobs and started to move up the ladder, but they're sort of bored. Other friends in physics started PhDs and when the novelty wore off you end up feeling very lost.  

If you are interested in exploring compsci some more, I'd really recommend making a Linux Live CD/USB and try running it for a bit. Have a poke around. You'll learn a metric shit ton about computers very quickly, and in Linux you have everything you need installed immediately to write, compile and run your own code in a variety of languages,  e.g. C, Perl,  Python, Ruby, and many, many others. 

As a side note, in case you don't know, you can dual boot Linux and Windows, install Linux in a virtual machine from within Windows,  install Linux on an external hard drive which you can plug in and boot from at your leisure,  or using a LiveCD/USB can use without changing anything on your computer. If you want any help or information on Linux, /r/Linux is a good place, but I am more than willing to answer any immediate questions you might have. Feel free to PM me or reply to this comment. 

Perhaps my parting comment should be this: there's no simple answer to your question or connundrum.  But perhaps a compromise could be worked out: computer animation for TV and films?

That certainly is historically high, but 1968 was at the height of the cold war. 6 years early in 1962 the world came as close as it ever has to nuclear Armageddon. The UK (and infact most western nations) had credible defense threats - so they did spend a lot on defense by modern standards, which infact are if anything the historical anomaly. 

We can trash this idea that Germany was not spending on defense quite easily; lets [look at defense spending in 1968](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/185677.pdf) (on page 10). The UK spent 5.54 billion USD on defense, while West Germany spent £5.28 billion USD.

Not likely. Bare in mind that as of today, we literally don't even have any idea how you could store tens of gigawatts of electricity economically, as would be necessary to not need backup gas stations at all. None of our existing battery technologies would scale to this level economically. We're not even at the ""look at this cool stuff we can do in the lab"" stage yet.

&gt;plus in 5-10 years we should have commercial tidal energy on board and hopefully decent wave energy will be in the pipeline which could provide base load along with some nuclear.

Nuclear can provide a base load sure, but you still need gas stations for when the renewables aren't working. Nuclear cannot be turned on/off quickly.

null,null,aenor,null,null,null,"&gt;One of things the leadership election has shown us is that two fringe factions have now formed within Labour’s ranks that are effectively mirror images of each other. The Corbynite ultra-Left, and the ultra-Blairite Right have become two sides of the same coin. Both are driven by ideology. Neither really cares about electoral success or failure. Indeed, both sides actually prefer failure in order to keep their particular ideological flame burning as brightly as it can. They are not activists in the traditional sense of the word, but cultists. Blind to any argument or evidence that doesn’t fit within the field of their political tunnel vision.

&gt;“Labour has to demonstrate what it’s for”, is a cry you hear often. Yes. But before it can do that it has to be honest about what it isn’t for.

&gt;The price of unity cannot continue to be deceit. Someone has got to start to level with Labour’s hard-Left. They have to look them in the eye and say: “If you genuinely believe in unilateral nuclear disarmament. If you believe in withdrawing from Nato. If you believe in simply printing money to build more houses and schools and hospitals then that’s fine. We respect that. But this isn’t the party for you. If you want to campaign for that, you’re going to have to do it elsewhere.”

&gt;And then they are going to have to turn, and deliver a similar message to Labour’s ultra-Right. They’re going to have to look them in the eye and say: “If you honestly still believe that going into Iraq was right. Or if you really think we should be axing welfare so we can guarantee defence spending at 2 per cent of GDP. Or if you genuinely don’t understand why it is people don’t still worship Tony Blair, again fine. We respect that too. But again, this really isn’t the party for you any more.”

I think Blair really upset Hodges when he declared that he'd rather not win at all than win with ""the wrong platform"". Hodges belives (correctly) that you have to get into power to do anything and you need to make compromises to achieve anything. Early Tone would have understood this, current Tone does not - have never seen so much venom from Hodges towards Blair as I have since this leadership election started.",null,0,null,1439226727,null,null,false,0,cty4wqi,null,t3_3ghh4j,null,null,null,t3_3ghh4j,null,null,null,1440395960,null,9,null,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,9,null

null,null,ruizscar,,For a PLP of Corbyns,null,"&gt; The illegal invasion of Iraq – which Campbell played a key role in facilitating – may have left a million people dead in four years. Millions more were forced to flee their homes and pushed into destitution. It led to the routine torture of prisoners and killing of innocent people by occupying forces. It led to the unleashing of US-sponsored death squads – a key component of its “Salvador option” for pacifying the country – across Iraq. It led to torture on a scale worse than under its former dictator. It led to an indiscriminate attack on a major city that included – in one of the cruelest ironies of the conflict – the use of banned chemical weapons. In the wake of the latter, Fallujah, a city the size of Leeds, is now experiencing a level of birth defects worse than post-war Hiroshima. In the words of US marine Ross Caputi, who took part in the attack on Fallujah, the Iraq war was “one long atrocity”.

In 2010 degree holders earned a median wage of £16.10 an hour whereas A Level holders earned just £10. This is easily enough to outweigh your anecdotal example. 

*Also I guess if I don't use the NHS why should I have to pay for it? Same with welfare! I didn't need it so fuck them*


&gt;Fee raising hasn't lowered the amount of people going to university so the 'benefits everyone' argument doesn't make sense, because the workforce would be just as educated if there wasn't fees. 

I really struggle to see your logic in this. Times are getting harder and harder for young people, of course they want to get an education to try for a better future. Now would this situation be better if we didn't have to put young people into 40k+ debt? Absolutely. 



&gt;Also IIRC the new higher fees allowed universities to spend more on their courses increasing the level of education recieved at British universities.

Wrong. The government took out the amount of funding that the fees increased by. Students now pay more for the same education. 

&gt;I don't see how from a left wing perspective free tuition is justified as it will mainly pay for future Middle and Upper classes degrees.

Because it will also pay for lower class degrees? It's harder for lower classes to move up the ladder as if they succeed and get a good job, they will still be paying the large amount of debt. Except they won't have the luxury of paying it off early or living in daddy's London flat to save on rent.

Free universal education is the best solution.

That would be playing directly on my identity. To counter this, what about all the muslims that have been saved? Remember the genocide in, the former, Yugoslavia - who stopped that?

Who has taken in MILLIONS of muslims seeking a better life?

Who has allowed the preservation of islamic culture?

Who is the one that is trying to bring the world together without the need for racial or religious intolerance?

safe streets. compared to some places on the planet, a few idiots playing crips and bloods killing each other every so often ain't a thing

shakespear's legacy.

socialism/capitalism coexisting and supporting each other. 

even though by english terms i'm practically destitute, i still enjoy one of the highest living standards on the planet.

religious freedom, but no power in religious institutions. time and again this has proved to be a handy trait. from fostering the begginings of modern science to every kind of art. also means that (before the propaganda machine fired up and tarred islam) different religions can and do live alongside each other in peace.

london. not the safe, clean, playground of the insanely wealthy, but the dirty, cosmopolitan sprawl that keeps things working. i can't afford to travel but i don't need to as the world is literally on my high street. multiculturism is all i know, and it works. people are people and the vast majority want to live love and labour in peace.

history. granted not all of it great, but we can use past mistakes as a rallying point against those who wish to repeat them. also at the very least it makes for an interesting read.

the weather. we get a little bit of everything, but not too much of any one thing. it's a mark of how awesome this little rock is when the rain is the number one problem for a lot of people.


CONS

the press. liars, shills and spin. always looking for trouble and more than happy to forment some if they can't find any. best avoided or taken with a lorry-load of salt.

television/celebrity worship. is it innocently appealling to the lowest common denominator to draw in audiences for the advertisers or 
is it a multi-layered conspiracy to de-intellectualise the population? all i know is that it gives me a fucking headache. 
also, sky tv. if i was paying a monthly sub i wouldn't accept the slightest bit of advertising. sky plus? pirate fucking bay. keep your adverts.

the class divide. i'm not talking about the working/middle class gap (although the differences between these two groups are pretty glaring), i'm talking about the aristo's and super-rich business class. i don't begrudge that they exist, but they can not understand the life of the everyday person. why they still get to run the country i don't know.

infrastructure is strained. it was mostly built in the 60's. luckily the immigrants are here to start expanding it, or at least holding it together while the gears of beaurocracy slowly get around to enabling new projects.

too much tax goes to the wrong places. the banks can look after themselves.

Yes! Then you begin to get to know eachother. Where is the line is a good question to ask to start to try and make an improvement and undo some of the damage that has been caused. It is in fact a much better start than the blame game method, which only makes matters worse.

&gt;Then you make your decisions based on what next? Age? Gender? Race? Occupation? Intelligence? Religion? Political views? Fashion sense? Football team? Smell? At what point does it stop until you find some one you are comfortable to stand near?

Have you ever known a group of people, all together, who then break away into smaller groups, or cliques if you prefer?

&gt;How many people will be left in the room when you have finally found someone who essentially will be a mirror image of you? 

There are some that go for this idea, the loner. Most however, prefer to forgive the fallacies of those they have most in common with for fear of isolation. They are especially forgiving when they see their associate under perceived attack from an identity they have been programmed to view as hostile.

I think it does, at least in part. It is why some are leaders and others followers?

Shooting west costs you a huge amount of energy from the Earth's rotation, shooting south involves making a monstrous sonic boom over densely populated territory, and shooting east does the same with the bonus that you're sending a bogey the size of a battleship at Mach 5 straight over the Moscow air defence radars.

If we want a spaceport for useful operations from British territory then the place to build it is Ascension Island; otherwise we can perfectly well fly Skylon out of the ESA bases in French Guiana.

That said, one could keep the Skylon fleet here for maintenance and have them fly down to Ascension with their cargo when needed, refuel there, next stop low orbit. They'd be lighter on takeoff, with less fuel and no onboard oxygen, so the base in Britain wouldn't need the monstrous runway the launch facility would require.

edit: Actually, looking at the map... somewhere around Inverness might work for an eastward launch. Head out to sea, turn eastward; since you're a winged spaceplane rather than a common rocket you can turn to avoid the Scottish coast, tack slightly south while accelerating in the atmosphere up to Mach 5, then close the intakes and switch to rocket mode, straight out over the North Sea towards the mouth of the Baltic. Just how long a run do we need to reach orbit? Could a Skylon be well out of the atmosphere by the time it passes over Gothenburg - enough so that sonic boom is no longer an issue? If so then the only problem remaining is to make sure we send the Russian air defence teams an apologetic bottle of Scotch from time to time to make up for blinding every infrared detector they have every single time we fire one of these monsters off.

edit, further: RAF Lossiemouth was one of the proposed spaceport sites.

When most people talk about sub-letting they mean letting out one room in a property they themselves rent out as a whole. In this case you do not have to protect the tenants deposit because no tenancy exists, you are allowing them to occupy. **If this is the case** then by all means carry on you have nothing to worry about.

As I understand it though, you are renting 1 room from a landlord, have gone away, and are now letting that room out to the French bloke. You charge him rent, he is the exclusive occupier, it is his principle home and you do not live there. This is a tenancy and falls under the scope the Housing Act 1988. You can call him a sub-tenant, lodger, guest, it doesn't matter, even if he agrees. (see Street v Mountford)

Lie

&gt; We are currently implementing a renewable energy deployment programme to ensure we generate at least 30% of our electricity from renewables by 2020

We count burning wood pellets as 'renewable', so we're fudging the stats on this. Wood pellets are pretty dubious for actually being better than fossil fuels, especially as we ship ours across from America. It comprises 7-8% of UK power generation.

&gt; Since 2010 we have seen an average of £7 billion a year of investment in renewables and last year we reached a record high of almost £8 billion.

That's not all government investment though, is it? In fact, it's mostly private.

&gt; They concluded that risks can be well managed if the industry follows best practice, enforced through regulation.

*If* the industry follows best practice.

&gt; The industry has committed to provide £100,000 in community payments per fractured well and 1% of any subsequent production revenues.

A pittance.

It is though. Money spent on shale is money not spent on renewables.

If you'll remember, The Doctor (one of the smartest and most creative Time Lords to ever exist) was still able to cause a dimensional rift on his own to talk to Rose one more time, but even then it was only strong enough to handle the Time Lord equivalent of a phone call, and just that burnt up all of the energy of an entire star! 

Hell, hiding Gallifrey in that other dimension took one of the most powerful pieces of Time Lord technology, The Moment. Sure, that was to move an entire planet between dimensions, but I think it still demonstrates that dimensional travel has never been impossible, Time Lords or no; rather it's just *effectively impossible* without an inordinate amount of energy and control of that required energy.

I don't think there is a lot of evidence that these non-voters will come out and vote if the candidate was different. Many people simply don't bother to vote because they can't be bothered and not because there isn't a good enough candidate but because they don't care and don't get involved. Certainly my personal experience, although statistically irrelevant, has been that people just don't follow politics. 

I also don't understand why people assume that if these voters did turn out they would turn out for Labour and not the Conservatives. If anything their lack of political involvement may make them more likely to be swayed by populist messages and the Tory mantra of people should work and not claim benefits (as they would label it) is more accessible than the merits of nationalisation and a more equal society. 

Overall I don't think non-voters are stacked towards one political persuasion and even on a 100% turnout we could well see them break the same on average as the wider electorate. 

Still non-voters usually won't vote. I think it's wishful thinking to assume that they would and that they would do so for Corbyn if they did.

I don’t really see how the defense was ""poorly set up"", the main issue was poor decision making which led to the no one tracking Rooney's run through the middle and towards the right side of the field.
    
If you notice both Davies and Walker were pressed high where we like our wingbacks to play. 
    
The main point of contention should go to Bentlab here, whose job it is to maintain possession. 
    
The second point of contention (for me at least) is the positioning of Dier following the turnover; He leaves the middle of the park to attack the ball carrier, but doesn’t fully commit or can’t get there in time... if you make this move away from Rooney, you HAVE to threaten possession. If Deir sticks with Rooney, and lets the two centerback do their jobs then he has coverage for the cross field pass.
    
His half-committal to the ball carrier leaves Jan with the odd decision to make: attack the ball carrier, or protect the overlap. He chose to try and slow the attack and cut the angle of the pass, a decision which was non-committal and led to the pulling of Toby from the center to cover.
  
But this is Toby’s job, that’s what he is supposed to do in a centerback partnership. I know it feels painful that Toby leaves Rooney, but covering that run is someone else’s job entirely… whom you might ask; Dier. If Dier tracks the free run of Rooney, then it leaves Toby with the ability to do the CB’s job, catching the overlap with his CB partner. 
  
If you go back to 21:25/26 when the possession is first given away, you will see both Toby and Dier make the exact same moves: drifting towards covering the run of the ball carrier. I think the main reason for this is they are both acting with the CB mentality tighten with your CB partner (Jan), play the overlap with one another and pressure the ball carrier into a mistake/slow them down and wait for help. The only issue with that: Deir isn’t a CB today, he is the CDM. Running back centrally and allowing Jan to take the ball carrier would work or tracking Rooney’s run would work, but his choice of drifting into coverage mode with Jan, and not making the tackle sets up the chain of events that leads to the goal.

At the end of this episode Clara finally snaps: ""You know what? SHUT UP! I am so sick of listening to you! ...you know what? It was cheap. It was *pathetic*. Nonono, it was *patronizing*. ...ohmygod was it? Really? Well *respected* is not how I feel! ...I nearly didn't press that button. I nearly got it wrong. And that was *you*.

I think alot of credit goes to Rodgers for bringing Can on. And alot of discredit could go to Rodgers for persisting with the 4-2-3-1. I'm glad with the result and the resilience we showed, but I think most supporters wanted to see a dominating performance after the embarrasing result on the same ground last season.

We played a sort of 4-4-1-1 from 0-60, which left Hendo and Milner basically useless in attack as they both had defensive responsibilities. I think the whole ""one pushes forward while one stays back"" is a fallacy that wouldn't work as the positioning would be affected and our shape wouldn't be as organized. We sat back inviting pressure, and tried to get at them on the counter to no avail, mostly due to Ibe's ineffiency. Benteke was pretty isolated, as we mostly lumped long balls to him without Henderson or Milner every going for the knock downs because of their defensive shape.

Now, after Can and Firmino came on things changed. We moved to a sort of 4-1-2-2-1, otherwise known as the Christmas Tree formation. In defense we played a resolute 4-1-4-1 which helped as the Stoke midfield would have to get through Hendo and Milner before meeting Can. They were mostly reduced to long balls as a result. The only problem was on our left side where Coutinho was obviously getting tired and being slow on our transition from attack to defence. That was why Rodgers was going to bring him out before he scored the stunner.

Overall, it was a good performance and I think we'll see the 4-1-2-2-1 again with Coutinho and Firmino as dual #10s. 3 points at the Britannia Stadium is in no way a given.

Currently pharmacists rely on history of what they have previously dispensed for the patient, and what the patient can recall. Not terribly reliable and not complete as patients sometimes go between different pharmacies.


This is just an additional function being added to pharmacists NHS smart cards, they currently use them for accessing the electronic prescription service on NHS Spine. 


The new addition allows them to access the summary care records function which shows a list of your prescribed medication and any allergies which the GP surgery submits to NHS spine.


Hospital pharmacists and some doctors already have access to this. The access greatly reduces the risk of errors and chance of harm to patients, as prescribing on admission make up a large portion of errors.

The effects will bite properly in 50-100 years when we realise that society hasn't innovated a game-changing technology with similar impact to e.g. lasers, nuclear power/weapons, the transistor/semiconductor devices, weather forecasting, GPS systems... the fundamentals of all of these things were laid down (roughly) a century ago and couldn't function without the development of quantum theory, general relativity, non-linear dynamics/computational physics, condensed matter physics etc. Sometimes pretty wacky and abstract ideas that seem like a nice academic hobby with no practical uses, but the eventual impact they have is profound. Even the non-direct consequences of physics research has amazing consequences: as far as I am aware, the research at CERN hasn't yet directly lead to the development of a widespread technology, but they did [give birth to the internet](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/birth-web).

Consider also the following statistic from cancer research UK:

&gt;More than one in two people born after 1960 will be diagnosed with some form of cancer during their lifetime.

Around 1 in 4 people in the UK die from cancer. Currently the best way of treating that is to use ionising radiation to destroy cancer cells whilst aiming to prevent damage to healthy tissue. Radiotherapy is a biophysical problem, and the techniques used to treat cancers were initially developed and discovered by physicists. The same is true of diagnostic medical imaging and sensing technologies. If physics research was to halt, the miracle breakthrough cure to one of the biggest health problems modern people face would be even further from reach.

I answered you in the second sentence of my comment.

&gt; why the fuck does the pharmacist need to see my medical records?

An answer from another user, who I think is a pharmacist:

&gt; So that pharmacists can clearly see what other medications people are prescribed, and make sure that new prescriptions are safe. Also to allow for more extensive medication reviews to try and reduce unsafe poly-pharmacy and reduce wastage.
&gt; 
&gt; Currently pharmacists rely on history of what they have previously dispensed for the patient, and what the patient can recall. Not terribly reliable and not complete as patients sometimes go between different pharmacies.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is just an additional function being added to pharmacists NHS smart cards, they currently use them for accessing the electronic prescription service on NHS Spine. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The new addition allows them to access the summary care records function which shows a list of your prescribed medication and any allergies which the GP surgery submits to NHS spine.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hospital pharmacists and some doctors already have access to this. The access greatly reduces the risk of errors and chance of harm to patients, as prescribing on admission make up a large portion of errors.

**TL;DR:** So you don't die.

The cost of alcohol in clubs / pubs has gone up alot faster than can be earned by that age group and theres Tuition fees. On a seperate issue many young relationships these days start from the internet, so people feel they no longer have to go out to bars or clubs to pull.

null,null,Iainfletcher,,Labour Member,null,"This is going to be controversial, but with all the !Corbyn's raising it, it's got me wondering.

Is the focus on early years intervention really the best way? I know the stats and work in education and see the reality which matches up, but hear me out.

A large part of the impact of children's life chances is about parental situation. Are they stable, do they have money for the essentials, etc. Or to put it another way, every 5 year old has a parent.

At the moment I see whole swathes of adults either low skilled due to poor starts to life themselves, or stuck in low wage jobs due to economic changes. The best thing that could happen to their children is an improvement in their parents' situations. 

Therefore, wouldn't money be better spent on adult education than pre-school? If you take a minimum wage employee and train them in something valuable, not only do their children's situations improve, but the overall economy improves that the children will grow up in. The money is more quickly retrieved through taxation and can therefore be more quickly recycled.

You could ration and prioritise if needed. But what keeps striking me time and time again is how much people's life chances are stuck post-18. When I've had flirtations with the Job Centre, it's the focus on getting them back into any low skilled work and at best absolutely worthless ""training"" in vagueries such as ""IT Skills"". If we took these people and (within limits) asked them what productive job they could see themselves doing (that there is demand for in the economy), then we could make immediate, life changing impact on people's lives. Rather than shuffling them into another low paid, short term job where the tax payer ends up footing the bill shortly afterwards.

Early Years education however, has limited impact and almost no economic impact immediately. Any teacher will tell you that a good school can polish the edges off, but by far the biggest impact is family circumstance. The other issue is that those families that most need a service are often those that don't access it. Whereas everyone wants the opportunity to improve themselves and their own situation.

Back home in Preston 24 years ago I worked in a club (Tokyo Jos). It was fucking ace - Northern Leisure who owned it made an effort, we took pride in the place. There was a fucking Chinese restaurant in the place and I got to play the tunes I liked to nearly 4000 people at Christmas with a fucking superb lightshow.


Then you started having turf wars between the doormen as to who was allowed to tax drugs in there. Northern Leisure sold out to Luminar who didn't give a fuck who did the door as long as they were cheap, I remember being in there one quiet night when the old door team turned up from Liverpool with hammers trying to bang the fuck out of the place. Luminar got sponsored to play certain tunes, so I was told i'd have to play 'It's In His Kiss' by Cher as my last tune before handing over to the main DJ. Fuck sake.


I moved to Cheltenham 2 years later. There was a superb club called Time, built by a local builder who did well with it. He sold it to Luminar = instant shithole. They got a new door team who turned you away because they didn't like you, shots were watered down, etc. Place went to the dogs and eventually turned into Liquid or whatever shithole national brand they had.

At the same time there was a local guy called Carl. Took over an old Walkabout here and called it Queeer - just named to keep out the beer boys. He was pilled out of his head most of the time and it was dirty but by God it was ace. We started around 6pm, I remember one night playing naked Twister on the dancefloor whilst an MC was rapping over us. We'd finish by 2am whereupon we'd go to a houseparty. Best time of my life.

He eventually gave up as he was sticking most of the profit up his nose and the place was falling down. So we tried to go clubbing elsewhere in Cheltenham - nope. All exactly the same, smoking ban robbed anywhere of any characters, it was easier to have house parties or free parties in the forest.

Since then it's been shit unless you're in London. Even Bristol is gash - i've been out a few times recently and Bristol is quiet even on a Saturday. There's still an underground and the occasional good club but they're lost in a morass of steep entry prices, arsey bouncers, noise regulations etc.

Nightclubs can work again but they need to modernise, like pubs. Freeholds, quiet places where you can chill out properly, decent soundsystems and proper DJs - it's not rocket science.

This cost one lot of band 3 (£222.50) because it was a single course of treatment - even though the root canal was done twice in that period.  One course of treatment, multiple visits, for the same originally diagnosed item.

Contact the dentist, say that what they are suggesting doesn't match the bands - say that if a filing and a root canal is necessary it's £51.30 all in.

He might clarify and say that you need a crown, which would make it the higher rate.

Regardless - seems they're charging you an exam fee AS WELL - that's naughty (and hopefully just a mistake) - point it out that the higher bands contain everything from the lower bands.  Might just be crappy paperwork - but definitely challenge it.

They cannot operate like private buses in a densely populated city like London.

If Translink were to shut down, then many people in towns and villages across the country would never have a bus service to the cities again.

&gt;It's also worth noting that it's going to be years before &gt;commercial-scale production of gas is up and running, and even &gt;the least optimistic forecasts of oil/gas prices expect the price to &gt;have risen considerably by then.

Fast-tracking a known controversial industry isn't a matter of pro/against, its a matter of democratic or undemocratic. What the Gov has essentially said is ""Hurry up, we're tired of waiting while the plebs have their say""

&gt;Tax breaks yes, direct subsidies no. And of course if we don't let this get off the ground, there would be no economic activity to give tax breaks to anyway!

An austerity goverment giving tax breaks to a fundamentally unsustainable industry would be so much fodder for the opposition, especially in the face of renewables being cut.

&gt;Our gas supply is relatively secure yes, but what about the rest of Europe? New UK gas streams coming online would nicely hedge against Russian influence.

No comment, but I doubt the UK has enough gas in its landmass to supply even a fraction of the Eastern European/other Russia dependents.

&gt;Economic growth is still a good think though right? Renewables and gas power stations aren't mutually exclusive in any way. In fact quite the opposite: Heavy use of Solar/Wind pretty much dictates that we're also going to need to use gas power stations extensively too. 

Under lying point is correct, but you have the specifics wrong. We don't NEED to use gas, if we for example invested in nuclear instead. Thats its own hive of public ideology issues, but the point is that gas is not a absolute necessity unless you discard all other forms of consistent power generation.

&gt;So you think we should build more coal power stations instead?

Because the only options are coal or gas? See above re: nuclear, plus more renewables (especially wind) would lessen our need (but not eliminate it) for gas/coal/nuclear.",null,0,null,1439237100,null,null,false,0,ctybywx,null,t3_3ggefi,null,null,null,t1_cty21ey,null,null,null,1440399351,null,5,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5,null

As for places to live, I've lived in Allerton, Mossley Hill, Aigburth and now Woolton for varying lengths of time so can only really comment on places in south Liverpool. Any of those places are generally nice places to live:

Allerton is fairly busy in terms of night life, theres a lot of restaurants and bars near the big Tesco end. There are also quite a few shops that sell every day items (butchers, green grocers etc). Also, Gerrard used to own a bar there but it has since closed down.  

I lived near Lark Lane in Aigburth for a year, again there are a load of bars and restaurants in all on the one road but the rest of Aigburth is more spread out than Allerton. There's a pub there called Bier which is good to watch the football and is usually rammed so I'd get there early to get a seat. They also do a pretty good quiz night.  

I live in Woolton now, and have done for just over a year. It's your typical little village, with a few shops, bars and restaurants and a gym. It also has a fairly regular farmers market. One of the more popular pubs (which I don't really like) is the Elephant, its usually always busy but its also quite expensive. If you want to watch the match you'd need to go across the road to the White Horse. Public transport is a bit of an issue, in terms of trains as there is no station near by, but there are plenty of buses that come through the village.

I'm an 18 year old (+8 months) male, which says something in itself. I don't have to worry about sleezy guys trying to grope me, or spike my drink (though it has happened to me) and so on.  
That takes off a lot of worry and pressure from me. I'm also in a relationship, so I don't fret about trying to pick up girls, or look astounding. When I o out, I go to enjoy myself; the music, the social aspect, the atmosphere. Obviously it's highly dependent on what club you go to.

I've been to a lot of the clubs here multiple times, and there are some that I absolutely love and can't wait to go back to, and there are some that I don't enjoy so much. That's for a variety of reasons - the sound system being bad, the atmosphere of the place not being great and so on.

Going to my favourite club with friends and dancing, raving and having a good time. I don't go to the club to chat to my friends. It's not a social catchup.

null,null,slippyg,null,null,null,"&gt;We rent from a student housing company, they act as our landlord (we have never met the person who owns the house). In our contracts we are told we are to report repairs/issues to this company, whom will get that sorted for us. When our heating packed in in December, we had to go through them to get British Gas to fix it. As such, I do not have an EPC, nor do I have a gas safety certificate (it'll be with the company).

Understood.

The relationship you have with the student housing company is on of a landlord &amp; tenant. You have issues, they are responsible for fixing them. Their obligations arise from various statutes in law, which as a landlord, they are obliged to follow. You are a tenant as they (as the landlord) give you permission to make the room your home, you have security of tenure, you have to pay rent and you have exclusive possession. 

This same relationship now exists between you and the french bloke. You are his landlord and he is your tenant. The duty and liability for failure, to do things correctly is yours alone. There is a long list of things you must do. I understand that your student housing company may have told you otherwise but that's fine when it's not likely to be them that faces the hassle later. Without arguing out the nitty gritty, as a landlord **you** are required by the Health and Safety Executive to have a copy of your gas safety certificate and to make sure that this has been given to the tenant within 28 days of moving in. It doesn't matter that the housing company has probably already done this (with you) because they are not his landlord, you are.

With all due respect I would not take legal advice from your student housing company (not that you have to listen to me) If your tenant were to decide he does not want to leave and seeks advice from the council, shelter etc. things would go badly wrong for you very quickly.

I'm sure that won't happen but you've dodged a very large legal bullet.

First off though you need to write a letter to the landlord explaining that you immediately require the return of the deposit, keep a copy of the letter for your own records and get the post office to supply you with proof of postage. I find it may be best to both post the letter and send an email, this will allow you to illustrate down the line a clear date from which you attempted to claim back the deposit.

null,null,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,null,"&gt; We actually played many shit games with Lucas in the team last year. 

We played many shit games with all players in the team, that isn't an argument. Lucas is a good DM and great at what he does. I don't agree on judging a player on stats but we had a fantastic record of wins when Lucas was restored to the team. Hell, he was an important part in our clean sheets last season, too. 

&gt; Lucas hasn't been the same since his injury 

No he hasn't, but this is trotted out a lot and has little merit when we play better with Lucas in the team. On average, we concede less when Lucas sits in front of the back four. 

&gt; Gives away too many silly fouls 

That's exactly what Lucas is good at and why he helps to break up play so much. 

&gt; I prefer Can 

Please tell me where you've seen that Can can do the same job as Lucas and I'll retract everything and agree with you. Can being our new DM is a pipedream that fans have who haven't really watched how he plays -- he wants to make runs forward all the time. That isn't what we need in that position. 

But it's cool because the revisionism of Lucas has already started because we're willing to let him leave. Next we'll be saying he's severely overrated and has almost no talent.

null,null,theinspectorst,null,null,null,"Thanks. I'll pick up on a few of your points.

I think you're overselling the 'benefit of hindsight' argument. My recollection from the mid-2000s period was that plenty of people were talking about how that the growth we were experiencing was froth fuelled by a property bubble. Here's a good example from as early as [September 2004](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3617236.stm) ('Predicting the next housing market crash is in danger of toppling football as the UK's favourite pastime. The media is full of warnings that the bubble is set to burst and many experts are now saying it is a question of when, rather than if, prices fall.').

The problem is that the one group of people who absolutely weren't talking about this was Gordon Brown and his supporters, who had sought to convince the nation (and more worryingly, themselves) that Brown uniquely had abolished 'boom and bust'. If you talk about selling a dangerous economic narrative, I think there has been none more dangerous in my lifetime than this one. When you reread some of the things these people were claiming by the end of this period, you can almost not believe it:

* [Polly Toynbee, 21 March 2006](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/mar/21/comment.budget2006): 'The light shines on Gordon Brown tomorrow [...] People used to laugh when Brown bombastically promised to end boom and bust: it was once the natural British economic weather. Who's having the last laugh now?'

* [Gordon Brown, 21 March 2007](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070321/debtext/70321-0004.htm): 'After 10 years of sustained growth, Britain’s growth will continue into its 59th quarter—the forecast end of the cycle—and then into its 60th, 61st and 62nd quarter and beyond [...] We will not return to the old boom and bust.'

Finally: I'm not a Tory supporter but I do feel I need to defend them from two of your charges.

First, I don't think it's fair to contrast the Major-era deficits with the 2004-2007 Labour deficits. Major was prime minister during the early 1990s recession and the slow recovery that followed it, so it's natural that the budget was in deficit over that period. What is notable is that, going *into* that early 1990s recession, the government (including with Major as chancellor) had actually been running small surpluses of 0.4% and 0.6% of GDP in 1988 and 1989. Whereas by the end of Gordon Brown's time as chancellor, the most recent recession we had experienced was still that early 1990s recession a decade-and-a-half earlier - he had no excuse for his pre-crisis deficits.

Second, you suggest that the Tories are not making the 'Labour under-regulated the financial sector' argument because they have no interest in financial regulation. Actually, since 2010 there have been some really big developments in financial regulation: in particular the Financial Services Act 2012 (which created the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee) and the Banking Reform Act 2013 (which required the separation of retail and investment banking in the UK and has infuriated the banking lobby). Admittedly, the Banking Reform Act, with is potentially the most far-reaching reform of UK bank regulation in a generation, was actually a Lib Dem demand in the Coalition Agreement - but it's probably unfair to suggest the Tories have completely shied away from re-regulating the banks whilst in government.",null,0,null,1439238113,null,null,false,0,ctycne5,null,t3_3gcx0w,null,null,null,t1_ctxt4lw,null,null,null,1440399671,null,0,null,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0,null

On one hand you could consider this a consequence of shitty options in life... of how poverty has led to an environment where among the many with very little, there are those who have little to lose. It's no surprise that poverty leads to a rise in crime of all sorts.

But on the other hand there is a significant gap between being unfortunate in life and actually causing the sort of misery this boy has. The most terrifying and awful part of all this is that it also shows a lack of empathy for fellow humans. This is not a sudden turn around for this kid. To actually stab someone and brag about it shows a long term pattern of behaviour. 

&gt;I am all for rehabilitation but there is this current culture of treating all violent criminals as a victim of circumstance. Punishment is a big part of justice in my opinion.

Absolutely. The problem however is that this kid doesn't really give a fuck. He values so little as genuinely important that he has almost nothing you can take away. Almost.

His 'status' within his group is something he values. Being detained for that length of time will do something... his group might move on and perhaps be more wary... if they do something similar perhaps they will also be taken away from their status. It's something... it's part of a disincentive. But alone... it's not enough. 

When he leaves prison he needs to be a whole person who will not cause more problems for the rest of society.

We need to teach kids like this some empathy for other humans, otherwise what is to stop them just doing it all again?  The only way a kid like this could be turned around is to alter his entire psychology. Rehabilitation is required. We need to TRY - not just for them. For everyone else.

Got a LG G3 with a cracked screen, the screen is only semi functional  currently but the LCD is not effected. Only parts of the screen respond but everything else is fine. 

You can pick up a replacement front glass and digitizer for £10-30, its just that Im not personally able to fix the phone myself. 

Asking for £140 O.N.O Will upload pictures in about an hour and i'll timestamp it tomorrow. 

Thanks :)

null,null,analyze,US,usa,null,"Referee here, but also a Chelsea fan, I will try to make this as unbiased as possible.

Referees are given guidelines to determine if a foul is considered DOGSO, or Denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity. It used to be the 4 D's:

- Direction - Was the ball going toward goal or away from goal?
- Distance to the ball - Was the attacker close to the ball?
- Defenders - Were there defenders between the ball and the goal (other than the one committing the foul)?
- Distance to the goal - Was the attacker close enough to the goal?

Recently, this has changed. ""Distance to the ball"" has been replaced with a C, ruining the easy to remember (and highly sought after) 4 D's, and making it 3 D's and a C.

The C is ""Control."" Did the attacker have control of the ball?

In my opinion, **after watching it many times** (a benefit that Michael Oliver cannot do until after the decision is made), this should have been a yellow card. It met all the criteria for me, except for direction. His final touch was going to bring him away from goal. That being said, I think I am injecting a bit of bias. If it was someone other than Chelsea, I would probably be making the argument the other way.

This is a really difficult decision, one which could have gone either way.

Worst part about that is that they tend to be courted the most by politicians eager to play to the lowest common denominator.. and through parades/riots and public disorder tend to be given a much bigger platform than they deserve. For a young person over here, it is alot easier to get a career grad level job. People are really friendly, and you will laugh when a local tells you about a 'rough' area when you see it. Pales in comparison, generally in NZ you are safe to walk wherever at any time. Politics also tends to be about bread and butter issues, which is a welcome change.

This is a good comment I saw in the match thread:

&gt;Sterling hasn't done that much on his own, but his pace and will to run at people is doing city the world of good. His movement off the ball is opening up more space for Silva, and the fact city are playing faster has made Navas look much better than we saw of him last year.

&gt;Last season this would still be 0-0 and they'd be huffing and puffing trying to break down an organised defence.

I'd also add my own thoughts on sterling - 

&gt;I've noticed that because sterling plays wider than Nasri, Kolarov doesn't have acres of space to begging him to overlap into all the time.

&gt;So he's staying back more than usual and then the two centre backs aren't anything like as exposed.

I know the stadium is going to cost us some money, but we are very good with finances and it would not hurt to go get a player whose best years might be behind them.  The CL thing is kinda iffy too as some top flight sides who are not in the champions league have gotten some solid players this offseason.  Payet had a great game yesterday at West Ham and he came from a CL side at OM.  He also had more successful through balls than any player in Europe other than Messi last year.

null,null,CheeseMakerThing,null,null,null,"&gt;Can we not start the knee jerk reactions? It was a disappointing game, yes, we deserved to lose, yes, but 3-0 is very harsh. Lambert, Dawson, Brunt, Fletcher, Morrison and Saido played alright, Lambert may have played well in fact. Gardner was playing way too slow, Lescott couldn't mark, Chester was out of position too much and McClean was a bit useless. Anichebe better not be here next week though, he can fuck off, no effort, just walking about, not getting on the ball, poor retention, I'm fed up with him. First goal was a fluke, second was poor marking from Fletch and third was against the run of play. Hopefully we pick up the pace and we have 37 games, but we need to pick up the pace, attack with urgency and start the game earlier than 30 minutes for the next few games.

On a further note, why didn't Yacob start? Played so much better with him on the pitch and Gardner away from there.

Edit: We could have scored from 5 corners, should have had a pen when Chester was pushed blatantly by Mangala, who should have picked up 3 yellows, and has two good chances when we were offside.",null,0,null,1439240958,null,null,1439241154,0,ctyeio5,null,t3_3giew6,null,null,null,t3_3giew6,null,null,null,1440400552,null,6,null,WBAfootball,t5_2tivu,6,null

I don't think the idea that more people would go to university without fees has been proven. (I would be interested if you find anything)

I'll try find where I read that about the quality of unis.

Lower class degrees isn't a thing, if you're working class after a degree you've fucked up royally. After a degree its no harder for 'lower classes' to move up the ladder as it is for middle classes, assuming the same skill level and work ethic. No middle class persons dad has a spare flat in London or pays off their childrens degrees. People from Middle class and Working class backgrounds are equal after university.


As i said, how do you pay for these tuition fees? What do you cut? Do you tax the middle class more? Do you tax everyone more? Do you take money from JSA, pensions, Defence? 

Esentially what tuitions fees are is a 9% tax on earnings above 21k for the FUTURE middle and upper classes while not forcing the working and middle classes who don't go to university to pay for it. This system is progressive and takes only from those who can afford it and have gained from HE.

The NHS point is terrible, anyone can still go to university, the systems still there you just pay for it after you have a job over 21k a year.

This PC has been previously used, but for the last couple of months has been sat working but unused gathering dust and since a recent upgrade, the idea was to generally to sell everything individually, and with that purchase some upgrades for a media center or server, but found it best to sell the machine and start from scratch instead!

I don't really like to post stuff so pickup would be ideal (NW England). 
Full spec is as follows
AMD FX 8350, stock clock (4.0GHz) [was OC'd to 4.5GHz but was reset in case the new user wanted to dabble with it themselves.]
Gigabyte 990FXA-UD5 Motherboard
Ballistix Sport 8GB 1600MHz (2x4)
Corsair H100i Watercooling Unit
Corsair 750w PSU
EVGA GTX 770 2GB
Zalman Z11 Plus Case
6 Fans
DVD Multi Writer

The system does have HDDs but they won't be included unfortunately. If required I can show the system booting.
Looking for £800, any offers will be taken into account and discussed.
Payments can either be made on the day of purchase or through PayPal.

Sterling had a few cheap giveaways but as long as he forces the opposing defense to account for him giving more space to Silva and the strikers he is worth his spot. I also think that soon he will be slotting home those 1v1 chances fairly regularly and that if Aguero was in the pitch with him he would have been there to finish it off after the keeper saved it. My only gripe with Sterling so far is that he seems to run ahead of the ball when he is dribbling.

Teaching people about the EU is not propaganda and those who say it are probably more afraid that education allows them to see through there lies.

* corsa - plz no.  They're terribly put together, very very fragile and don't pull for shit. Incredibly overpriced for what you get and the older ones have probably been thrashed to bits by boy racers.

* astra - not bad.  Cheap reliable workhorse, they don't hold their value which is good if you want a cheap one,  bad if you want something to sell on.  They're still plasticy and feel cheap on the inside but they just work. They come in decent engine sizes as well so they drive a bit better even if they're a bit bigger. 

* fiesta - probably the best of the bunch.  Incredibly reliable and the zetec is a great block. 1.25 engine seems small but they weigh a lot less than most cars. They won't be pulling a caravan but they can be fairly nippy. They do however suffer with rust on the runners and wheel arches so make sure you know someone who knows bodywork.

This PC has been previously used, but for the last couple of months has been sat working but unused gathering dust and since a recent upgrade, the idea was to generally to sell everything individually, and with that purchase some upgrades for a media center or server, but found it best to sell the machine and start from scratch instead!

I don't really like to post stuff so pickup would be ideal (NW England). 
Full spec is as follows
* AMD FX 8350, stock clock (4.0GHz) [was OC'd to 4.5GHz but was reset in case the new user wanted to dabble with it themselves.]
* Gigabyte 990FXA-UD5 Motherboard
* Ballistix Sport 8GB 1600MHz (2x4)
* Corsair H100i Watercooling Unit
* Corsair 750w PSU
* EVGA GTX 770 2GB
* Zalman Z11 Plus Case
* 6 Fans
* DVD Multi Writer

The system does have HDDs but they won't be included unfortunately. If required I can show the system booting.
Looking for £800, any offers will be taken into account and discussed.
Payments can either be made on the day of purchase or through PayPal.

The system tracks every access by every user, and to get to some parts of the record the user has to click a button which acknowledges they have a genuine need to see this information.  This feature enables people to be sacked for browsing information they shouldn't, as happened to a bunch of people who thought they would ""just have a look"" at a well-known rugby player's records when he got admitted, and found themselves no longer employed.

null,null,penurious,null,null,null,"You make many good points.  I'm not sure I have the time to give a full rebuttal, but some points:

I don't think I am overselling the 'benefit of hindsight' argument.   Brown was clearly hubristic, but I think it's important to note that the housing bubble in the UK was not a major cause of the global financial crisis.  It was clearly a bubble which may burst, but had it I'm not sure the consequences would have been anything like as serious as the gfc.  I repeat, virtually no one in the mainstream predicted this the scale or severity of the crash.

In fact it may be argued the effect of the housing bubble was to give the impression that the economy was performing better than it actually was.  In which case it may be argued that Brown's spending was good to keep the economy growing.  Brown could have cut spending sure, but given the infrastructure and growth over this period I'm unwilling to accept that he should have.

The important point I think is that his spending was far from a dangerous level.  Take for example the cost of goverment borrowing (10 year bond yields), this generally fell over the period, had his spending been extravagant it would have been punished far more harshly (Larry Ellison makes this point in his guardian article today).  Debt internet payments were relatively low (and remain low) as a percentage of gdp.  I'm not arguing for deficit in perpetuity, but there are much better measures of whether we are 'over-spending' than simply the deficit.

I take your point about deficits during the Major era.  Nevertheless I think it just goes to show that deficits during a recessionary phase aren't so bad and don't require us to adopt austerity.  In this context a deficit is better to think of as an accounting statement.  Austerity in my opinion has intensified the crisis and hurt the most vulnerable in society.  If the Tories were really interested in cutting the deficit, why give a tax break on inheritance to the richest 4% of households? (I realise you don't neccessarily support this, I mean it rhetorically).

OK, maybe that was not just a few points.  I may get to your point about regulation, but that's another similarly length post. In short I don't think they've done enough.

&gt;The Other was influential during the Dark Times on Gallifrey after the cult of Pythia had ended. He and the Hand of Omega shared some sort of a bond. 
&gt;As Rassilon's rule moved closer to despotism and Gallifrey's borders were sealed, the Other attempted to escape the planet by hurling himself into the Looms to await his eventual reconstitution. (PROSE: *Lungbarrow*)

Edit: Here's my response to all the ""he can't win because he's more left-wing than Ed Miliband"" posts.

After the 2010 election, the right-wing set a narrative that Labour lost because they couldn't be trusted with the economy, more or less blaming the global financial crisis on Labour.

The morning after the 2015 election, without any evidence, they tried to set the narrative to ""Labour lost because they were too left-wing"" (completely changing their tune from ""Labour &amp; SNP will destroy the country""), in an attempt to get rid of the chance of any left-wing party coming into government. However [research](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CK76CquWcAA0TyM.png:large) (and pre-election media) shows, people simply didn't think Ed Miliband was up to the job, they were worried about the SNP, immigration or they didn't trust Labour with the deficit (no left-wing doesn't mean borrowing money) or even, Labour had lost touch with it's working class roots and didn't provide a clear alternative to the Tories. The people who started claiming Labour were too left-wing were, unsurprisingly, traditional conservative voters. Unfortunately, Blairite MPs continued to spread the idea.

I do not understand how you can listen to the above clip - where an Irishwoman was killed by the IRA because of their violent pursuit of politics - and not realize that none the victims of the IRA were unfortunate victims of a natural disaster which occasionally had ""evil consequences"".  They were murdered by the IRA because they were an acceptable death toll to the IRA and Sinn Fein's leadership in their pursuit of something which could have been done through peaceful means, or because they directly opposed the IRA and their violence.

How do you not realize that nothing the IRA did was justified? Yes, the Catholic population of Northern Ireland, of which I am part of, suffered horrendous oppression under a reactionary, sectarian statelet but the IRA did nothing to help them and makes things far worse.

Corbyn's moral equivocation on this is intolerable.

Im selling my amazing CPU cooler - the Dark Rock Pro 2 from Be Quiet.

Can achieve amazing OC with it whilst still having a silent system. 

Grab an amazing cooler at a great price!

But I have no doubt that if we are 6th or below, he'll be gone whether we fans wish to give him time or not. This season is the make or break of Rodgers, and if he sticks with Lovren then he sticks with Lovren. But if Lovren continues to put on sub-par performances, it won't be him getting the flack it will be Rodgers. I'm guessing Sakho realises that and may stick around a bit more - maybe the next manager will give him a chance.

As a fan, I'm excited about this season because it's so important. Rodgers has clearly been wanting Benteke for 2 years now so he must have a damn good idea of how he will function. We've got some great attacking players and some good solid defenders.

About 7 years ago, between contracts, I walked (well, caught the RH&amp;DR) from Hythe to Dungeness, then along the seafront to Camber Sands, where I camped overnight in someones front garden (at their invitation), then up along the [old tram line to Rye](http://www.urban75.org/railway/camber.html) then along to Hastings.

While I was in Dungeness, I was told the story of the converted railway carriages that are now residencies. Southern Railway used to own the land, and allowed some of their workers to put carriages there, so they could stay throughout the summer, travelling up to the depot in Ashford to work.

Whilst your general point is valid, we don't *need* to use gas, nuclear cannot fill the gaps for renewables. Nuclear is generally ""always-on"", you can't turn it off when the wind is blowing and turn it on again when the wind dies down, it takes a long time to power it up and down, and generally its better to use it as a baseline supply. 
Gas is generally seen as a good fit alongside renewables because it can turn on and off quickly and efficiently (ie, when renewables are working, we save on gas) and its less wasteful than coal.

3) Cahill is behind the attacker at the time of the foul.  Would be VERY difficult for him to stop the attack fairly

Erm, isn't he supposed to be a poet? Doesn't that mean you're supposed to actually know something about the language you're talking in?

&gt;Anglo-Saxon

You mean Old English? The major basis of English which makes English a Germanic language?

&gt;And because the Welsh language and culture has been under threat

Yes, because of this thing call standardisation.

&gt;If I was Welsh and a Welsh speaker, I'd probably be a militant!

That's lovely. You tell everyone to accommodate you.

&gt;we need to hear more of the Welsh language in festivals such as Latitude.

Um, okay. I'm guessing Latitude regularly has bands sing in foreign languages then. So that beggers belief as to why any Welsh bands singing in Welsh haven't applied or gone to it.

&gt;and sometimes we forget that there are local cultures which are very different to English mainstream culture and literature.

Would be great if he could identify English mainstream culture. I mean, I guess not everyone does cheese rolling or Morris Dancing but what exactly does he mean? 

&gt;That's why I've always said that the Welsh language should be taught in schools in England. Hindi, Chinese and French are taught, so why not Welsh? 

Because no-one speaks it. Also, why teach something culturally irrelevant? At least teach an English Brythonic language. Most people, especially those of Brythonic decent (of which the English people are partially descended from) are not interested. 

&gt;They're part of our culture, and I know of people in England who don't know that people in Wales speak Welsh, **or that there's a Scottish language.**

So smug, he suggests there's only one.

&gt;Once you learn these things, it's almost impossible for you to be racist, because you will realise that we have all come here from somewhere. 

Erm, I hate to burst his bubble but the natives of this country don't identify with the specific Viking, Angle, Saxon, Brythonic, Pictish tribe that their genes came from.

&gt;Tribes have been settling here and bringing their language and culture for millennia

I suppose I was expecting it to be an ""England has no culture, only stuff from abroad which inexplicitly homogeneously creates everything"".

I do kind of agree on the point of ""we have always been multicultural"" but you can pretty much say the same thing if you come across someone who has only said ""pal"" whilst you only say ""mate"", or ""dinner"" vs ""tea"".

I suggest he takes a look at what we have to offer instead of belittling us. It's too late to start reclaiming ""diversity"", the word has become dirty even to those who love foreign food and culture, foreigners and other countries.

This culture thing, it's always really vague when people dictate about it. What do people mean when they say culture?

Food? Media? It's all there. You even get individual villages who have their own different recipe for things like jams, sauces etc. Cheeses etc. It's just really weird how he goes to Eisteddfod but only talks about that it's different instead of actually talking about what he was getting up to there.",null,1,null,1439246532,null,null,1439247927,0,ctyhwnj,null,t3_3ghpri,null,null,null,t3_3ghpri,null,null,null,1440402149,null,-1,null,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1,null

There was a woman killed in ISIS controlled territory! Why are they not rushing to get offended at that!?!? /s.

Shortly after I got the insurance cheque for about 800 quid (about 800 quid more than the car had been worth) I went to see my sister in Falmouth, Cornwall. 

I needed to buy a new car, but that could wait till after the drunken weekend with my sister. 

During the drunken weekend with my sister we walked past a garage selling an H reg London taxi (a Fairway Driver version of the classic FX4, for full disclosure) with about 500k on the clock, probably gone round once already, for 800 quid. 

At the end of the weekend I did not have 800 quid, but I did have a remarkably rusty and knackered taxi cab. Also a hangover to be proud of. 

Technically I wasn't drunk when I bought her, I was really really hung over. You know that state of hung over where you just *need* something to make it better, like a greasy fry up, or some berocca, or the strongest of coffees. Well, sometimes that thing can be a 20 year old taxicab with enough miles on it to get to the moon and most of the way back. 

I drove it as my personal vehicle for about a year until the MOT ran out and it would have cost about 1600 quid to get her back on the road, especially after a garage blew most of the electrics (including the speedo) trying to get her started again after they flattened the giant battery. 

I did not have that money, so she had to go to the great taxi rank in the sky. Pity, apart from the rust and a myriad of small things the engine was solid as a rock, the three gear auto transmission (with overdrive!) was smooth as a nut and she drove like a charm, if loudly and slowly, and expensively.

This really gripes me. Birmingham City Council represent the borough of Birmingham, and therefore the civic flag is the flag of the borough. 

We, the people of Birmingham, do not need permission to use the civic flag. 


(a) Flags which do not need consent
The recent changes allow a wider range of national, sub-national, community and
international flags. The full list of flags that do not require consent are:

(a) Any country’s national flag, civil ensign or civil air ensign;
(b) The flag of the Commonwealth, the European Union, the United Nations or any
other international organisation of which the United Kingdom is a member;
(c) A flag of any island, county, district, **borough**, burgh, parish, city, town or village
within the United Kingdom;
(d) The flag of the Black Country, East Anglia, Wessex, any Part of Lincolnshire,
any Riding of Yorkshire or any historic county within the United Kingdom;
(e) The flag of Saint David;
(f) The flag of Saint Patrick;
(g) The flag of any administrative area within any country outside the United
Kingdom;
1 
(h) Any flag of Her Majesty’s forces;
(i) The Armed Forces Day flag.

The Department of Justice recently commissioned a bit of research carried out by QUB, and only 5% of the sex workers surveyed had even witnessed trafficking in the industry (e.g. seen someone who was trafficked, been around pimps who trafficked, or been trafficked themselves).

You can read the full document [here](http://www.dojni.gov.uk/index/publications/publication-categories/pubs-criminal-justice/prostitution-report-nov-update.pdf), it's fairly long though so here's DoJ's [own press release on it](http://www.dojni.gov.uk/index/publications/publication-categories/pubs-criminal-justice/independent-research-into-prostitution-in-northern-ireland.htm). If you're at all interested, it's a fairly thorough piece of research dealing with local sex work and trafficking, which is obviously quite different to other situations around the world based on geography, laws, border controls, etc.

It's only one piece of research, but most relatively-unbiased (all research is biased to some extent, but I mean ones that aren't directly funded by sex worker organisations or anti-sex worker organisations, and are more done by universities or governments, especially when in direct contact with sex workers themselves) show that the Swedish/Nordic model - criminalisation of buying sex - makes things more dangerous for sex workers and doesn't decrease the amount of people buying sex, it just makes the conditions more dangerous, whereas decriminalisation and potentially legalisation (meaning regulation) such as in New Zealand makes things much much safer for everyone.

null,null,Masterofknees,logo,,null,"&gt; Who are particular players to look out for?

Aguero and Silva are our two best players, Yaya Touré included when he feels like it. Kompany is usually our best defender, but he went through a rough patch last season, so we'll see if he can regain form, he's one of the best in the world when in form though. New signing Sterling is also incredibly talented for only being 20 years, he'll be a huge star in the future no doubt.

&gt; What is our usual formation?

We're switching formations this season. In our title-winning 13/14 season we went 4-4-2, we tried that a bit in the last season (14/15) too, but ultimately it didn't work well anymore and so it seems we've switched permanently to a 4-2-3-1. In friendlies we have also deployed the 4-3-3 sometimes, but truth be told in action it's not very different from the 4-2-3-1.

&gt; What problems has the team been facing and what are our strengths?

Mostly defensive woes. Like I previously mentioned Kompany has been going through a rough patch, Mangala had a lot of trouble settling last season (being a new signing then), and we don't really have a world class left-back either. Our midfield also has a tendency to not provide cover for our defenders, usually it's Yaya who's caught slacking, so again defensive problems.

Our strengths are definitely in attack, Aguero and Silva is a partnership unlike any other in the Premier League, it's pure magic. In the 13/14 season we scored over 100 goals for example, and in the past two seasons we've scored more goals than any other team in the top leagues except Barcelona and Real Madrid.

&gt; Are there players who are known for particular things (headers, free kick specialist, etc)? 

Yaya is known for scoring long-range goals, usually in unexpected moments, he can have a total shit game but make up for it by just getting a goal out of nowhere. I'd say Kolarov is our free kick specialist, he's got a hammer of a left foot. Aguero is the king of last-minute comebacks, look up the context of our 3-2 match with QPR in 2012, it's one of the most important moments in the club's history and it's essential to watch it as a City fan. He also tore Bayern Munich a new one in the Champions League last season in the closing minutes.

&gt; Also, do we have any rivals?

Manchester United are our main rivals, we lived in their shadows for *many* years. When our club was bought by Sheikh Mansour the money suddenly began flowing, and soon after we were able to snatch the Premier League title from them, what a fantastic feeling.

Other than that we've not been a top team long enough to really make a lot of enemies there. I guess we can count Chelsea, they're competitive rivals and generally have a completely opposite football philosophy from us, they play very defensive football and are happy to get a 0-0 draw against other top teams, which is a stark contrast to our attacking philosophy.",null,0,null,1439248427,null,null,1439248830,0,ctyj06l,null,t3_3girhq,null,null,null,t3_3girhq,null,null,null,1440402666,null,12,null,MCFC,t5_2s14k,12,null

null,null,Overgrown-Watermelon,null,null,null,"I did iGCSE English language (as a first language), so this may be completely different if you're teaching lit classes, but the language exam &amp; how to get marks on it was extremely precise (which made it so easy). It was basically write 3 points, explaining it with 2  more points, do this 4 times and you've got yourself an A grade. Pretty simple. I had to write something about how grotty a foreign hostel was. 

My teacher was amazing, and she taught us perfectly. We met 3/5 times a week for an hour. We had a few months to learn the language exam structure as we were also busy learning Of Mice and Men &amp; An Inspector Calls for another exam board. The class was around 25 people, with varying abilities. 

For the iGCSE all we did was practice on past exam papers,  practiced and practiced. For the book reading we all sat taking turns in the class, and watched the movies that came with the books several times. The teacher also took time to explain how  and why things happened - and always managed to ask for our opinion. It's what made the class less boring and more engaging. I know we had to make posters one day explaining one aspect of a character, and of course their 'facebook  profile' where you write descriptions, their statuses, and expand on their characters, and I guess you can do that if the class is losing hope. 

There was also after-school and lunch pop in sessions where students just came to the teacher and asked for help which was a life  saver sometimes. 

My teacher made me go from a fail grade to an A, and the main thing that I liked about them  is that they genuinely cared to see the student pass. Which is always a good thing.

You just disputed it yourself. None of us know how Rodgers treats the players, and every time that a player has come out and complained about him (Agger, Carroll), it's been after they were sold.

No player likes to be dropped down the pecking order, but it happens, and has to happen for a team to improve. It'll obviously cause friction between a manager and player when the manager promotes one player over another. My guess is that Can is simply being bumped up.

I don't think your point on Johnson rings true either. We had limited options in that position, with Flanagan injured and Manquillo not impressing. Rodgers changed formation to shore up the defence and even played Can at right back when we did play a back four.

This statement sums it up perfectly. Stevie used to charge back and make tackles like this a lot, even when we had Masch playing as DM. It didn't ever make Stevie a DM, it just made him an incredible box to box midfielder who had tenacity and who could make a tackle.

Maybe Can *could* be a good DM, but lets see how he fares when protecting the back four against a technical attack like Arsenal (when they are firing). I am not convinced he has the turning ability and positional awareness yet. And in no way am I saying that he *couldn't* develop it, nor am I sure that would be the best way to utilize him ultimately anyway.

What we have seen is that three strong worker/runners in Can, Milner and Hendo works alright **in the absence** of a DM when deployed as a three and that is good news.

Corporate veils are drawn to protect assets which are in the name of the business, it's tricky and best addressed by a lawyer in company law. MIB isn't guaranteed to pursue your father and if they don't think it will be viable to get money out of him they may well not. 

My background is Scottish so it may differ in England slightly but I would typically raise court proceedings against the MIB, the insurer and the actually negligent third party (your dad).

Hes lost a few steps regarding his pace but he has solid positioning and tactical awareness which more than makes up for his speed, also speed is not a vital attribute needed for a defensive midfielder anyway.

Can played a ton of games last season and hes very young, hes still inexperienced and Allen is a worse player than Lucas, has had more chances under Rodgers these past seasons, and has shown hes an injury prone player who doesn't add enough when fit.

yeah, I can't really sort out my feelings. It seems excessive to go from one industry that i'd hoped to be in for years (although I think I may have deluded myself now) to one that I've only recently looked into. That said, I've kind of always loved computers and it may be my 'real' passion...

This may be a better way to put it:

1. I'm not sure if film production was something I convinced myself I wanted to do without actually engaging in it (I love the *idea* but i've done the bare minimum for a good grade rather than putting myself out there, however when I think about screenwriting/cinematography I get a little excited. Perhaps I could do photography and screenwriting as a hobby for a while instead, though)

2. I'm not sure if my initial excitement from doing basic html is a long lasting career-extending goal, or a hobby i've undertook because a couple of my friends got apprenticeships in similar things. I've always felt like I should be involved in computers - I just can't tell if this is a temporary feeling or something long lasting. I'm not choosing this above film production just because it has better job prospects; it'd be better put for me to say that I am less secure in my belief about being both good and dedicated in film+tv production when I have much more I want to do. For the last week, i've imagined myself sitting through my course, getting the work out of the way so I can go back to learning coding.

P2P lenders are a good thing.  They're regulated by the FCA, and they're not scams.  You get a decent rate of return, and provided you're well-diversified, they're fairly safe.

The main downside for me is that it's not always easy to get your money out.  You lend to people or companies, and those borrowers make monthly repayments, which arrive in your account.  To keep getting interest on your money, you need to keep re-lending the repayments to new borrowers.  That means there's never a time when all your money's available at once, so to get your money out, you have to withdraw your repayments on a monthly basis, or sell your loans through the secondary market, which comes at a cost.

I'd say for P2P to be good, you first have to have filled up your ISA, since you want to lock in that tax-free amount.  Then either you're investing for the medium term (5-10 years till you want your money) or you already have index funds and you want to diversify.

You can mitigate the risk by splitting funds up into small quantities lent to large numbers of people, or by lending through a company with some sort of fund designed to reimburse your losses, but even then if there were a widespread crisis that produced an unanticipated number of defaults then you could still end up losing money.

The odds of it happening are low, so don't take this as blanket discouragement, but that's the nature of investing rather than saving.

You have to remember who we are and what we do well and essentially you have to believe in our scouting network who are going to know so so so much more than any of us. I Agree that some of our signings have been underwhelming but remember how little we have paid. We got Classie for like 8 mil or something ridiculous and soares looks great. Remember we didn't sign Alderwerield till late August and he was arguably our best addition last season in terms of completing our squad. Our strengths do not lay in signing one big name and relying on them to perform because guess what happens they get injured and you end up losing 5 games in a row.

When you say that everyone of the electorate that didn't vote tory - which includes people that didn't vote at all - automatically disagree with the tories and agree with another party more, in what way is this not what you are saying? You may have *meant* something else, but this is exactly what you said. 

&gt;Secondly, if people didn't vote for the conservatives (or anybody else) then they didn't agree with their policies.
And before there's any of this ""nah they're all just lazy shits"" nonsense: I didnt vote 5 years ago precisely because I agreed with none of the parties at all.

Oh okay, so you think everyone else is the same as you? How do you know people didn't vote just because they couldn't be arsed or have no interest in politics and not because they didn't agree with any party? Also, you said that people who didn't vote at all agreed with another party more than the tories... so again I don't know how you've came to this conclusion.

This PC has been previously used, but for the last couple of months has been sat working but unused gathering dust and since a recent upgrade, the idea was to generally to sell everything individually, and with that purchase some upgrades for a media center or server, but found it best to sell the machine and start from scratch instead!

I don't really like to post stuff so pickup would be ideal (NW England). 
Full spec is as follows:

* AMD FX 8350, stock clock (4.0GHz) [was OC'd to 4.5GHz but was reset in case the new user wanted to dabble with it themselves.]

* Gigabyte 990FXA-UD5 Motherboard

* Ballistix Sport 8GB 1600MHz (2x4)

* Corsair H100i Watercooling Unit

* Corsair 750w PSU

* EVGA GTX 770 2GB

* Zalman Z11 Plus Case

* 6 Fans

* DVD Multi Writer

The system does have HDDs but they won't be included unfortunately. If required I can show the system booting.
Looking for £700, any offers will be taken into account and discussed.
Payments can either be made on the day of purchase or through PayPal.

The Doctor can regenerate anywhere but it seems the process is easier on him if he is closer to the time-space element which is in the TARDIS. Most of the regenerations were done inside the TARDIS.  

The following regenerations were not inside the TARDIS. Descriptions of the specifics of the regeneration copied from the details of the above YouTube video because they were very well written and concise.
2nd Patrick Troughton -  Jon Pertwee was forcibly regenerated by the Time Lords on Gallifrey outside his Tardis.
3rd. Jon Pertwee - Tom Baker: Planet Of The Spiders, Part 6 (1974) The Third Doctor dies of radiation poisoning from the crystals of Metabelis Three.
4th. Tom Baker - Peter Davison: Logopolis, Part 4 (1981) The Fourth Doctor falls from the Pharos Project radio telescope and merges with the Watcher.

I *don't* believe we'd be able to agree on a price with Sporting, and there's other teams that'll be keeping tabs on him and might step in if we force the issue (Arsenal? PSG? Real Madrid? All been mentioned). And the fact that he's out for at least a couple more months I think would probably take him off our wishlist - some teams have a squad that can manage fine until he's fit, but we'll have Milner, Henderson, Can and Allen (who's out for a month or so as well) to cover 2 or more positions at any given time. So I'm not optimistic.

But holy shit, Carvalho has the potential to be any team's best signing of the summer. Talked about him as a dream signing before, playing him and Can in the deep midfield 2 where Milner-Hendo started yesterday would be fucking immense. The strength, workrate and ball-winning of those 2 would dominate most sides in Europe, and the balance between William's defensive instinct's and Can's attacking ones would keep us protected while driving forward. I don't expect it but I'm going to cling on to the slim, slim possibility. Illarramendi is more realistic, and would be a good addition to our midfield. He's just the less exciting name on that list.

As for Lucas, I like the guy as much as anyone but as an asset to the team he's limited. He's a good box-to-box midfielder when there's other people in dedicated defensive positions but without that and considering his injuries and how they re-occur and have slowed him down, he's just not a player who should be one of our primary options.

There is a lot of the use of the word ""colonialism"" - but the Falkland islands were uninhabited when Britain got there.

Here in NZ we have elections every three years, so the effects are quicker to observe.  We, like the UK, have what many perceive to be a terrible government, yet they keep getting re-elected, most recently with a FPP type majority.  So the question becomes how can such a terrible government keep getting the votes needed?

In a recent interview, a government minister dismissed the concerns expressed in a question by the interviewer as [not politically relevant](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/comment/70236755/critics-of-trans-pacific-partnership-are-not-politically-irrelevant.html), which then made me wonder what this meant,  it subsequently leading me to the uncomfortable conclusion that this MP was right.

/u/pause-break is probably not ""politically relevant"".  I base this observation, on frightfully little evidence, admittedly, but I don't think you are about to vote Tory.  I suspect you do, and will continue to vote Labour.  Thus nothing any party says is likely to change that.  There are people on both (I hate these terms but...) the left and right who are fixed left and right voters, and thus they are all ""irrelevant"" as they are not going to change sides, so there is no point in their party wasting electoral effort on them.  To do so would be, to use the old term, preaching to the choir.  

The trick of recent right wing governments is to focus on those relevant voters, those willing to vote left or right, those who vote based on what they think is the right thing for themselves and the country.  And what the right wing parties have done is to improve these folks lot so that they convert from ""might-vote-left-or-right"" to favouring the right, thus increasing the right share of the vote.   In New Zealand, this could be seen in the right talking about ""compassionate conservatism"", and handing out the first increase in benefits above inflation for 45 years.  This is the language and actions of the left from a right-ish party.

They right may have been so successful at this fixing the politically relevant that there is numerically no possibility of the right wing party not winning.

The ""centre"" of politics I've chosen to define as the area occupied by the ""relevant"" voters, as they effectively determine the outcome.  I think that yesterdays right-a-bit is now the new centre.

Thus I think there is a real possibility that ""conventional"" left wing parties are currently simply unelectable.  The right have pulled it off.  They use scare tactics to remind the relevant voters of the ""loony left"" and how damaging such a party would be for the country.  Relevant electorate buy it hook, line and sinker.

My opinion is that the only way that the opposition can get back in the game is to, by and large, moving to occupy the space currently occupied by the winners.  Blair with New Labour proved this can be done, and the left voters didn't desert New Labour, which logically they should have.  But it's unfortunate that the Blair government is remembered for the terrible things they did, rather than the great things they could have done.

He's my favorite Classic Doctor. I do hope that the BBC is able to reconstruct the Lost Episodes. With technology as advanced as it is, they can do it. They make holograms of dead celebrities, insert them into movies and tv shows, and modify audio clips so they can make dead celebs seem as if they are still 'alive'. They can, in essence recreate William Hartnell, voice and all if they wish, not just mimicking his old lines and movements from Classic Who, but have him show up and interact with 2015 worlds and beyond!!!! What would the Universe of Who be like if that would happen?

The same is true for tax credits. These are the poorest people in society and they spend everything they get every month.

When the money is spent by the recipients, it goes back into the economy and is taxed at every stage. The government gets that tax back, and meanwhile, its circulation has a multiplier effect which grows the economy. A growing economy creates more jobs which reduces the strain on the benefits bill.

Building more houses would be another way to reduce the strain as, unlike JSA, housing benefit goes straight into the pockets of landlords and is less likely to be spent, so no multiplier effect.

What?  I think you're out of date.  It was privatised under the Coalition with the Government retaining a 30% stake.  In June Osborne announced he'd be selling that off too.

So over two parliaments we'll have gone from an entirely state-owned Post Office to an entirely-privatised one, without the privatisation of the Royal Mail appearing in a single manifesto.  Some democracy!

edit: some subtlety required - the above is strictly incorrect.  The Coalition government detached the Post Offices from the Royal Mail, and the Post Offices remain state-owned.  So if you substitute 'Royal Mail' for 'Post Office' above it becomes accurate.  The postal service is entirely privatised, but the shops where you buy stamps and post your parcels remain state-owned.

I always try to take in a show or two if I'm visiting, and despite what you might hear from others, I'd recommend doing one of the many open top bus tours, they're a great way to see lots of the sights in a short time. Outside of London, Edinburgh has a fair bit to do, but it's much smaller than London so don't expect to spend as much time there.

If you're into history, I'd STRONGLY recommend York. You literally trip over Viking shit all over the place and it's a good stopping off point on the way between London and Edinburgh.

Avoid Stonehenge. There's next to nothing there and you can't get up close to the stones anyway. If you've seen a photo, you've seen Stonehenge.

The Lake District is LOVELY. If you like outdoorsy things, hiking, boating, that kind of stuff, you can't go too far wrong, but if you do venture into the hills, be safe, the weather can turn in a second and even experienced walkers find themselves in trouble.

I, personally, have never been to Wales, but I hear good things about Cardiff and it's pretty easy to get to. Again, if you like hillwalking and stuff, Snowdon is the place to go. Wales also has a few nice heritage railways too.

Speaking of railways... ugh. It's confusing. There are some deals available to people visiting the UK, but many of these are only available to folk from the EU. The one that you would want to be looking at is called the BritRail GB Pass and you can find out more and price it up [here](https://www.visitbritainshop.com/world/britrail-gb-pass/). There are different options so I'll leave the explanation up to them. The train service is... serviceable. Considering how small our country is, there are  an absurd number of companies involved with delivering our rail service. Each one has different standards and you will find people only too happy to complain about all of them. In my own experience, the worst I've ever had to put up with is faulty air conditioning on a warmish day.
