The centre of the Celtic world - south-eastern Britain, Gaul and the Rhine Valley - were pretty much on a par with much of the Mediterranean world at the time of Caesar's conquests,  and indeed was very much integrated with it.  Large urban centres called *oppidum* had sprung up all around the place,  the Celtic kings were minting their own coins which looked strikingly Greek,  and the Greek and Latin alphabets were widely used. Personally,  I think this is why Gaul was conquered at this time - it had developed sufficiently so that the Romans could walk in and take over the already established state apparatus rather than have to build it from the ground up. 

As for Britain - well, there were cities here before the Romans. There must have been a sophisticated Road network,  too - otherwise,  the Britons' widespread use of chariots in war would have been practically impossible. In war,  it was hardly a one-sided process - it took three attempts before the Romans were able to establish a foothold in the south-east,  and many years thereafter before the rest of the province was under their control.  There were many notable defeats for them, not least the obliteration of an entire legion by the Silures outside what would become Cardiff. Technologically speaking,  there wasn't much difference.  In fact the Celts,  with their ringmail, may have had the edge.

That leave us with one failure, David Bentley. And should we really use one outlier with a mental problem to describe all of this?

Ronay's problem is that he tries to make the case that until Poch shows up Levy has been wheeling and dealing with no to little plan.

But if you look at each transfer window, there tend to be more Dawsons and Modrics than failures.

On top of that our scouting system appears to have been operating pretty well recently (although maybe that's tempting fate with the new signings only just coming in), so I'm inclined to have a little faith in them. 

I still think he's a bit of a risk, but if I had to make a case for him here are some mitigating factors to think about.

- He was playing in a poor team last year and still performed well comfortably ending up leading the team in both goals and assists (not only does this mean he's capable of performing above the level of the team he's in.. it may well be relevant that he coped with the pressure of being the main attacking threat in a relegation threatened team that's reliant on him)
- He hasn't played the bulk of his career as an out and out centre forward from what I can tell, which would account for his fairly shitty goals per game ratio thus far in his career
- Having finally been given a chance as the main striker last season he had easily the best year of his career which could lead one to hope he's on a big upswing in terms of his development right now",null,0,null,1437782784,null,0,false,0,ctf7c2l,null,t3_3ehuiu,null,t1_ctf7c2l,null,t1_ctf3n4f,null,null,null,1440068955,null,4,false,avfc,t5_2s569,4,null

Prawn cocktail - prawns (shrimps) served in a cocktail glass with a tomato-mayonnaise sauce. It's pretty good but seen as quite old-fashioned, we (my family) only eat them at Christmas.

The fish on the fish menu will be battered and deep fried, which is the traditional English way of making it. Pick a fish of your choosing, it's all good, but the two traditional ones are cod and haddock.

English breakfast - a breakfast consisting of fried bacon, sausage (not like your sausage, the cylindrical ones called 'bangers' later on in the menu), fried egg, and usually toast, fried mushrooms and braised tomato with baked beans on top. A classic.

Ploughmans - a platter with bread, cheese and pickle (a kind of sour, tangy chutney) on it, usually served with pickled onions and beer. Decent but basic.

Gravy - not like your gravy. Our gravy is basically beef stock mixed with hot water to go thick, like a beef sauce. Good on almost anything savoury.

Bubble and squeak - like a hash of potato and various vegetables. Decent, but again, old fashioned.

Most of the people they went to school with would still be around for their entire lives, not only would they know the people in their street but also nearby streets. There was a network of shared knowledge, if you didn't know someone, you would likely know someone who did.

The first destroyer was slum clearance, whole communities were broken up when areas were cleared. Slum clearance often involved moving people to new towns or new suburbs, in many cases 2 communities were broken up at once, that of the people being moved and that of the people already living where they were moved to. Then the process was repeated in the cases where the ""new"" housing was found to be sub-standard necessitating a repeat disruption. 

The second destroyer was mass immigration.

The third destroyer is the rise of commuting, people no longer live where they work or shop where they live. In fact they frequently travel distances that would be regarded as absurd a generation ago. My grandfather walked to work, my father bussed 5 miles to work, I commuted anything up to 80 miles.

Piecing all the limited snippets we've got together, I think it's likely Tonev called Logan a ""black *something*"" in anger thinking it would fly here, which it obviously doesn't.

The Liberal Democrats blocked the Snooper's Charter.

Rightly or wrongly, the taboo against *appearing* racist is extraordinarily strong right now.  Perhaps we want it to be that strong and perhaps it's good that it's that strong, but there are likely side effects to creating such strong taboos - and one of them is that people will go out of their way to avoid the *appearance* of racism, even when it comes into conflict with other values.

For instance - look at the female genital mutilation situation.  Last time I looked, there had been not one prosecution - and yet it's estimated that tens of thousands of girls have undergone this procedure.  In that case, it seems probable to me that a fear of being seen as culturally insensitive at least partly explains why.  Crazy as it seems, the stigma of racism was enough to prevent the police from arresting people who were taking their daughters to have their genitals sliced off.  And if that's the case for FGM, then isn't it at least possible that the same fears were at work here?",null,0,null,1437785220,null,0,false,0,ctf8kia,null,t3_3eg6rb,null,t1_ctf8kia,null,t1_ctf69z2,null,null,null,1440069537,null,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8,null

null,false,Nemokles,null,null,null,"Oh, give it a rest. The team was racking up a string of poor results which leads to morale taking a dive. One victory in the last five PL matches. 

Stoke was also deadly effective with 6 goals in 9 shots on goal, 15 shots total. Liverpool had 4 on goal, 13 total and a majority of the possession. Stats can be misleading, but normally this is not a 6-1 result. Heck, if you look at the highlights (I'm not going to go back and watch the entire game) Stoke were both lucky and good. They made the most out of half chances and the ball bounced their way in front of goal constantly. 

Twice Mignolet saved the ball and it bounced straight to a Stoke player with what is now an open net. Those are lucky goals. They had two good drives from just outside the box and one perfect cross to Crouch, which there is nothing to do about. Our defenders can't compete against a guy who is that much taller, that was just Stoke playing well to their strengths. There's of course a lot the team could've done to close down these opportunities earlier, but on another day this is a 2-1, 3-1 defeat. We were close to slotting a few ourselves, but you gotta take missed chances into account when evaluating our own performance. 

Poor results combined with a lot of pressure to send Gerrard off right is a poor combination that has little to do with Rodgers, Stoke playing well and being lucky has nothing to do with Rodgers, what Rodgers did to try and motivate the squad and if he did so poorly or not, we do not know, playing Can in defence, however, is all on him.",null,0,null,1437786299,null,0,1437786752,0,ctf93qp,null,t3_3ef2an,null,t1_ctf93qp,null,t1_ctf4srn,null,null,null,1440069788,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

You can't think Burnham is a good leader if you actually hear him speak about anything, 'it was the best of manifestos, it was the worst of manifestos' comes to mind.

 Cooper refuses to take a position on anything, she wants to wipe out child poverty? So does everyone, she says she'll invest in science but doesn't expand on it at all.

 Kendall seems to have a vision for the future but it's a vision that would have every socialist branded and told they're not welcome in the Labour party, she's a less uniting figure and that is hard. 

I agree that none of the candidates are particularly amazing, but when you say Corbyn is inflexible most people just see that as being principled.

 I'm tired of flexible politicians who only care which way the wind is blowing, right now we've got many Labour MPs telling us the Tories are *the* most ideological government we've had for decades, but to counter them our acting leader decides to split the party by abstaining on a welfare bill which will leave the poorest worse off? 

They did it to play the Tories at their own game, which is how people think we won in 97, but it wasn't, we offered left wing polices in right wing wrapping paper, whether or not we delivered on those polices is another matter entirely.

The Labour top brass have brought this on themselves, Ed Miliband was a joke, I liked him, but he was a joke. So what do you expect, people are going for a candidate who actually says what he believes.

 You say he's got a lack of imagination but he's the one ignoring the fucking idiots at the top of the party who are all for not blaming the electorate but are all for blaming the members. 

The left of the party has been shown how much the right actually fucking hates it, and it's disgusting.

Haldane believes that companies are giving too much of their profits to their owners (and thus anyone who buys shares on the stock market), rather than reinvesting those profits into growing their businesses. As a result of this, the shareholders are effectively demanding more and more money in a shorter period of time. 

In the interview that aired on Newsnight, he said that about forty years ago an average share would have been held for around 6 years before it was sold, but now it's sold after an average of 6 months. 

This, he argues, leads to a short-termist view, so businesses are creating money, but not as much as they would do if they were to invest and grow their businesses. Effectively, he's saying that shareholders are demanding money now, rather than waiting and reaping higher rewards in the future. What this means for the economy as a whole is that many British businesses aren't fulfilling their full potential, and as a result growth isn't as high as it should be. 

He's advocating a change in company law so that shareholders have less of a say in where the profits go, and other stakeholders (e.g. employees, consumers, clients) have a greater say.

Roberto Carlos, regarded by most as one of the best full-backs ever, was criticised throughout his career for his defensive game. Aly Cissokho, a solid defender, was lampooned by Liverpool fans because he wasn't effective going forwards. If they are expected to overlap and get into the box, as they are at Liverpool, we need to understand that they can't always be 100 yards away at the other end of the pitch, in a perfect position, within the eight seconds or so it can take the opposition to move into a counter attack. Not even Usain Bolt can run that fast. 
 
 The thing with full-backs is that, because of the role they play, as soon as we are in possession they move out of a good defensive position.

When I saw the previews of the fake people, I told her we had to stop because what was coming up was technically a three-parter.  Of course it isn't, but we watch about three episodes a viewing and I knew we have to watch those three together or she would demand that we keep on watching.

I showed her the first of Nine's episodes and then Blink to let her see if she'd be interested in watching.  She asked what happened to Billie.  Told her she regenerated.

Whenever she asked me something that's coming up, I either tell her, ""Spoilers,"" or make something up.  Season 6 was the first time I accidentally gave something away by laughing at the first episode's lake scene when she was all concerned.  It was fun pointing out actors though.  ""Oh, he plays a Time Lord.  She also plays a companion.  She is Doctor's actual daughter... and also sleeps with the Doctor.""

But yeah, be careful.  Apparently she saw some stuff on Pintrest involving River and she accidentally got something spoiled that happens next week.

Average total Police Workforce over the past 3 years: 214,350 (rounded)

&amp;nbsp;

Only 25 out of 43 forces supplied data, so to scale up the 309 offences detected:

    309*(43/25)=531.48

So without any further data on which size forces abstained, I've roughly scaled it up to compensate.

    (532/214,350)*100=0.25% (rounded)

Now I've worked out what percentage 532 offenders is of the total police officer average over the last three years. This assumes that none of the officers and/or staff are repeat offenders.

It's roughly a quarter of a percent. I would argue that that is a very low ""bad apple"" percentage.",null,0,null,1437790767,null,0,false,0,ctfb8wh,null,t3_3effz0,null,t1_ctfb8wh,null,t3_3effz0,null,null,null,1440070798,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Average total Police Workforce over the past 3 years: 214,350 (rounded)

&amp;nbsp;

Only 25 out of 43 forces supplied data, so to scale up the 309 offences detected:

    309*(43/25)=531.48

So without any further data on which size forces abstained, I've roughly scaled it up to compensate.

    (532/214,350)*100=0.25% (rounded)

Now I've worked out what percentage 532 offenders is of the total police officer average over the last three years. This assumes that none of the officers and/or staff are repeat offenders.

It's roughly a quarter of a percent. I would argue that that is a very low ""bad apple"" percentage.",null,0,null,1437791891,null,0,false,0,ctfbsbk,null,t3_3eexka,null,t1_ctfbsbk,null,t3_3eexka,null,null,null,1440071119,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

experience in training to become a barrister and in the
early years of practice than their predecessors. Reports of
recent sexual harassment were rare. The most significant
challenges were avoiding being pushed into certain types
of work and balancing career and caring responsibilities.
These challenges may play a large part in the high attrition
rate; many women leave the Bar after becoming parents
and do not return. Junior women leaving the Bar results
in under-representation at senior levels; for every woman
with more than 22 years call there are more than 4 men.  This has implications for the pool of talent from which we
recruit members of the judiciary, the number of female
Silks and for chambers politics. The experience of women
barristers reflects a wider social challenge for all those
combining work and primary caring responsibilities
in any workplace, and the low proportion of women
in senior positions at the Bar is echoed in many other
professions. It is hoped that this new data may assist
the Bar to support women to stay in the profession, and
ensure that those who do stay are not disadvantaged.

EDIT: I would add, however, that the full-page portrait of the Chairman of the Bar Council on page 2 of the report is in rather questionable taste.

The point of my criticism isn't of him even when we make top 4 this season. For a long period of time. If I have every conviction he will drop Coutinho or Sterling had to integrate a ton of young talent. FFS why are you on about? And who could start at LB have been linked with them. He is not nearly good enough to be a waste. How long can a player just being an unbelievable performance by him.

He doesn't play a ""vital role"", in fact he's got the easiest job in the world. Coming off the bench fresh to shut down games from a defensive midfield position when your entire team is on the back foot and supporting you in defence is literally the easiest place on the football pitch. You don't get blamed for goals or poor tackles or if you just hobble about looking like you're doing something. His tackle success rate was 51%. That's **worse** than Fellaini, Emre Can, Fabian Delph and even fucking Cazorla who is at 54%!

Mikel's lapses of judgement have caused this team on several occasions, which you don't remember now because who the fuck cares to remember individual circumstances involving a player after you've won the league, right? He gets reckless in tackles, is lethargic in moving around, and his short passes are really poor for a player who plays at DM. Worst of all, he is one of the slowest players to get back from an attack. Its like he's forgotten how to sprint. So don't give me that under-appreciated bullshit.

You are allowed one free transfer per week. If you want more, you get a 4 point deduction. You have 1 wildcard to use so you can have unlimited transfers for only 1 gameweek. If you have a player who does not play in a certain gameweek, the player is subbed out and the first player on the bench (which consists of 1 goalkeeper and 3 outfield players) gets subbed in. 

Points are added up for all players. In a classic league, all points are accumulated every gameweek and whoever has collected the most points overall wins the league. In a head-to-head, each gameweek, you face a player. Who ever has the most points wins. 3 points (on the table) for a win, 1 point for a tie and no points for a loss.

null,false,observeroftheworld,null,null,null,"A heartfelt apology which acknowledges the specific crimes and damages committed to the people involved will go a long way to resolving this conflict.  Germany owned up to its crimes of the twentieth century but Japan has not.

I think it comes down to how long ago the crimes/damages took place, whether they also involved British companies which are still active today (Mitsubishi) as well as individuals who are still alive and were directly impacted (raper and victims alike), and if there was long lasting damage such as a virtual human or cultural genocide.

If all identifiable human victims of specific crimes/damages, such as people who lost land or freedom, could tracked down and compensated  financially, then one could say Britain acted in good faith and reparations made.  The apology must accompany the action.

I do not believe it can be expected the countries be held to account for more than a real apology for crimes/damages that occurred more than a century ago.  For example, Spain murdered masses of indigenous central and South American people in its pursuit of their gold.  They would be hard put to do more than apologize to the descendants because that stolen gold has been spent or stolen in turn, and Spain is no longer ""rich"".  Same for the Portuguese who raped Goa.

There is the ""reasonableness"" issue that must be considered.  Europeans and Asians raped and pillaged each other's countries since time immemorial without apologies or contrition. They did the same to each other and worse to the indigenous people of North and South America, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. In my opinion, one can only apologize for older crimes and damages.",null,0,null,1437795648,null,0,false,0,ctfdizw,null,t3_3ehnpj,null,t1_ctfdizw,null,t3_3ehnpj,null,null,null,1440071938,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

which is why plenty fans want rodgers to sign a real CDM. if he is going to play this game with his fullbacks often overlapping and pushing up in the opposition's final third, why not just buy a destroyer to sit infront of the CBs? this way he can cover the space behind the fullbacks and protect the area infront of the cbs...

 ideally  you want a cdm who can read the play but is also physically capable of covering the ground and winning the ball off people. you can't always get both traits in one player (mascherano), but just having one of these options would be nice. southampton have apparently signed a good one in clasie, lets see how that works out for them...even though theyll still have wanyama in that space who is a monster physically.  

i dont know how lucas looks to others in preseason, but for me he still seems to lack the pace he had pre-injury. he was great at defending the pitch vertically before, but I don't see it anymore. i'd rather start can in this position and let him develop through mistakes. knowing rodgers though, he will yank him once he has the inevitable error and it costs us points. plenty of posters here are emotionally attached to lucas and that is fine, however, it is obvious he is past his best.

in regards to moreno's CB partner, I don't think it is a coincidence his game looked better with Sakho behind him, rather than calamity lovren. sakho is good at stepping into space and i think youd feel pretty confident if you were the fullback and you saw that fucking tank of a man covering ur ass.

this is where skrtel makes me nervous, as he constantly backpeddles and his instinct seems to be to always lead to opposition shots on goal. still better than lovren.

Ok, agreed.

They do at least have London Pride on tap.  It's not reason enough to go to Arizona but if I was already there for some unfathomable reason then it'd be a reason to stop by this place.

They say mint sauce complements lamb quite nicely. The mustard will be hotter than you imagine; US mustard really is a much sweeter variety than we are used to. The various curry sauces would go well with basmati rice and a piece of grilled chicken or something. The peri-peri sauce is from Nando's, a popular chain restaurant which serves Portuguese-style chicken. Mild to extra extra hot.

The biscuits: the hobnobs have got a crunch to them and I like to put peanut butter on them. Personally I'd go for the McVities digestives rather than the Cadbury ones since they're the ones I'm used to, but both are probably good. Digestives pair well with a cup of tea or a cup of hot chocolate. Jammy dodgers contain a chewy raspberry flavoured jam filling. Rich teas are bland.

The malt vinegar is unremarkable; really it's just vinegar. The HP sauce is a bit difficult for me to describe...I'd say it is akin to your steak sauce. I like to add this condiment to chips (what you call french fries), bacon, sandwiches, and baked beans which you will find directly below. 

Branston pickle is a variety of chopped up vegetables in a sticky, sweet, slightly spicy brown sauce. Best served on a slice of bread with a thick piece of cheddar cheese.

null,false,observeroftheworld,null,null,null,"Having been educated in Britain, this man is both clever with the use of the English language and its semantics.  For example, by claiming to be anti-zionist, and describing a Zionist to be someone who usurped another's land, he shows his hypocrisy.  He had meant to say (I believe) that he is against the country of Palestine being usurped for Israel. But he did not say it clearly.  This is obfuscation of the facts: his movement is not a respecter of the boundaries of any country considered to be part of the ancient Levant (western Mediterranean areas) and his ideology does include ""usurping"" them into the caliphate.  He dares to call Cameron a hypocrite playing to populism, yet that is exactly what he did with his answers to the interviewer. He presumed the reader is ignorant of the meaning of his words regarding his ideology and was quick to focus our attention away from it through very general statements.

The caliphate will not be fully democratic for the same reasons that current so called democracies have not been.  One must take into account the existence of human greed, search for power, etc.  Take for instance the Supreme Leader of Iran, and you will understand how power corrupts. Once ""elected"", one will learn that the supreme leader quickly becomes insulated from all but an inner group of like minded people who stop respecting the masses and then cling to power.  To westerners, democracy means a secular state and inherent rights being accorded to the people who allow a government to rule them. For a  caliphate, the power of the state and power of the Islamic supreme leader become one.  The difference in how one is governed extends to all aspects of one's life, particularly one's freedom of thought, expression, etc.

Did not mean to go on and on.  Reading the article brought me back to university days where critical thinking was fundamental to understanding the world.  Reading this man's veiled answers, cloaked in simplistic ideology, was too tempting. His words and messages cannot be taken at face value.

&gt;However the move has been strongly criticised by trade unions and some Labour MPs.

&gt;Mick Cash from the RMT union described its privatisation as a ""national disgrace"" and said the current arrangement was earning the British people ¬£1 billion:

&gt;  ""It is a national disgrace and an act of utter betrayal that the government has confirmed that it is bulldozing ahead with the re-privatisation of the East Coast Main Line despite all the figures showing that the current public sector operator is handing over a billion pounds back to the British people while delivering huge improvements in service and customer satisfaction.

&gt;  ""The decision to hand this profitable and successful public rail operation back to the vultures from Virgin/Stagecoach is based purely on hard-right political ideology and RMT is committed to continuing the fight to block this betrayal right up to polling day and beyond.""

null,false,The_Sponge_Of_Wrath,,TK Maxx Junkie,null,"Okay. There are a few steps that you need to take:

* Ensure that you blog regularly. This is one of the most important steps in drawing an audience: new content at predictable intervals. Set aside time in your schedule for your reviewing requirements - both the time required to test, and to write the review.

* Ensure that your blog has a dedicated theme. Mingling makeup with your music and other reviews means that you don't build an audience. People who want makeup reviews will find most of your other content of little value. People looking for a music blog will find no use in your makeup posts.

* Chat with other bloggers. Don't be one of those cheesy people who drops their blog link in every comment you make. Just read other blogs, comment on them, be polite and professional. You aren't trying to leech these people's readers, you're trying to make friends and contacts who might be willing to answer any blogging questions you develop in the future.

* Get a FaceBook page for your blog and do what you can to get Likes. This becomes useful months down the line, so set it up ASAP.

* Treat it like a business. It's *work*. Once you've got six months of content don't be afraid to run some FaceBook ads to drive traffic to your blog. Target the ads at friends of people who have liked your page, because the odds are that people who like makeup will have friends who like makeup ;)

* In the interim, start by contacting smaller companies. NYX even openly asks bloggers to contact them and wants to engage. Tell them that you are just starting out in makeup blogging and would appreciate any help that they are willing and able to offer. Some might give you contacts, some might offer free samples, some might ask you to come back in a year if you're still active, and some might ignore you.

* Register for affiliate codes with whoever will do them. I don't know if BeautyBay or FeelUnique have affiliate systems, so do your research. You need to be able to draw an income from your blog so that you can invest in new products to test *for* your blog. Be honest on your site and make it clear that you use affiliate codes.

You seriously underestimate the victim complex present in the Muslim population, and it's no different amongst the Pakistani subset. 

Politically nobody wants to touch the issue because all it's going to cause is a loss of votes. It's not just about being labelled as racist, it's about not wanting to cause short-term civil unrest (which again makes current politicians less likely to win the next election) by exposing racial issues like this. Far-right groups have been saying for years (amongst hundreds of other things) that Pakistani gangs are targeting white girls, for a politician to actually acknowledge that it's true is massively dangerous to their chances of being re-elected, even though it's true. 

Extend and pretend is the mantra of every career politician. Better for things to blow up after you leave office rather than have to make controversial decisions yourself which will only offend people and lose you votes. 

This is why we need to rethink how we deal with cases like this. The councillors should not be able to lean on social services or police in order to make them back off.

* Corbyn turns up, a veteran and relic form the past, breaks the Blair model of modern politics
* media can't even *find* a personality to attack him with, and his policies are actually appealing
* suddenly everyone's unhappy because he's different and is actually popular with the public, despite not having to lick the shoes of people like Murdoch for campaign money

null,false,mitch1975,null,null,null,"Looks like a great place to live, and I wish cities in the UK could be the same, but I have a list of issue (if any of you have seen my previous posts you will know I like a list)...  
1. Utrecht: 40 sq miles, population 350 000  
  Greater London: 600 sq miles, population 8.5 million (and I think that's wrong)  
  
If you put the two side by side it would look like a Penny Farthing, there is no way you can cite the solutions of one as an example of how to solve the problems of another. Oxford, Cambridge, Southampton yes. London no. Utrecht has deliveries to the center done in electric vans smaller than a Black Cab, it wouldn't work over here.  
2. The video was edited in such a biased way as to discredit it itself. 3.45 the split screen compares two, one is a commuter in London whilst the other is a couple going to the shops. Compare like for like and its a valid point, compare different types and its an attempt to mislead.  Some cyclists commute 10+ miles a day and doing so at the speeds shown would take an age.  
3. He quotes Presumed liability. This goes against every principle of UK law. Every UK citizen is innocent unless proven guilty and to change that in one area to liable unless proven innocent is a dangerous precedent and one I don't like. Its Pre Judging and shouldn't happen.  
4. At the same time this was tried in Utrecht it was tried over here. Stevenage built a system of cycle paths which went unused. Peterborough had more success and the current layout with its pedestrianized town center and extensive dedicated cycle lanes are the best I have seen in the UK. You never hear about that in any articles and I assume its because Peterborough cyclists have nothing to complain about.  
5. I like Chris Boardman, he is intelligent and polite, a perfect ambassador for cycling. But for me he is sometimes idealistic. Yes a change of attitude can &amp; should happen but to expect cities to build on that scale is over optimistic. The age of building New Towns has gone (unfortunately, we do need a few more) and wishing that level of demolition in London or Oxford is not realistic.  
6. Londoners are different to the residents of other cities in the UK and very different to residents of cities around the world. Look at the difference between how Londoners get on the tube and how they do it in Tokyo. Madrid stops for lunch whilst London has it delivered to its desk.  This is the main thing that needs to change to make the roads safer, a sensible calm driver/rider can cope with anything, a hot head in a rush cant.  
.  
.  
Don't get me wrong, I would love to live in a city like Utrecht and if I was putting up my manifesto to become London Mayor it would include turning areas into something similar, but only the centre. From Covent Garden to Trafalgar Sq (and possibly to Buck Hse), all of Soho and up to Oxford St  could be turned into something like Utrecht. Leave a few roads for traffic (Charing Cross, The Strand, Regent St, Shaftsbury Rd) and the odd service back road but pedestrianize the rest and fill them full of shops that people want to visit, make London great and not a series of coffee shops. A small area like that could mirror what was shown in the video with lorry bans during daylight and wide open free spaces, but for the rest of London its not possible.

I'll address each point:

1. The fact that gp's are not employees of the NHS is irrelevant to whether they can operate at the weekend. The NHS has contracts with them, those contracts can be changed. Like any industry or business anywhere.

2. Yes we probably do need more GPs and that will make it easier to operate 7 days a week. However em there is still definitely a benefit to shifting week hours to weekend hours worked because people often find it easier to get to the doctors at the weekend, and would be less likely to need to take time off to do it. It perhaps is only straightforward to do in bigger practices where there are enough doctors to provide coverage.

3. Again, bringing GPs into the NHS is really not the issue at all, and changing their working practices can be achieved either way. I would have big doubts about GPs being more efficient or effective if they were all absorbed into the giant machine of the NHS.

&gt; 
&gt; More details
&gt; Typing Rev Mike Walsh on facebook or Twitter will prove all the information required.

**STOP MINTING COPPER COINS (1p &amp; 2p pieces)**
&gt; 
&gt; There is very little that can be purchsed for 1p or 2p now, so it is pointless having these coins. It is also a waste of money minting them. If the lowest denomination of coin minted was 5p then everything could be priced at ¬£x.95 instead of ¬£x.99
https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/104372

**Ban the Burkha on the grounds of security**
&gt; 
&gt; I read many times of the call to ban the burkha in the UK. I only support this on the grounds of security. 
&gt; I have no problem with the Burkha but when you are not allowed in banks shops or government buildings with head gear that obscures your identity then this needs to be debated.
&gt; 
&gt; More details
&gt; I have on several occasions been 'bumped' into by persons wearing the burkha and find this offensive and antagonist.
https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/104649

**Standardise the word for bread roll across the UK and EU to the word Cob.**
&gt; 
&gt; There are many words across the country for the humble cob. Barm, Baps, breadcake etc... all are in wide use around the UK. This is confusing and quite obviously wrong. 
&gt; I propose that the correct word ""COB"" be made the standard word and made legally enforceable word across the UK and EU.
&gt; 
&gt; More details
&gt; The word cob originates in the midlands as the when they were freshly baked they resembled the cobbles in the street. As it originates in the midlands it makes sense to spread it to the outer reaches of the UK where the use such stupid words as Barms, Baps, Breadcakes all of which are incorrect. 
&gt; It is a COB. This should be enshrined in law.

null,false,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,null,"First off, I have a big theory about the similarities between soccer and basketball that I've been kicking around in my head and I'll eventually write it up and post it here.

In short, it starts with the idea that both soccer and basketball are both popular globally and breaks down to points regarding marketability of individual players, the vocabulary we use to describe the sport, the similarities regarding tactics, etc. etc.

As for the snippet from Grantland...

&gt;""Liverpool‚Äôs summer feels very American. Rather than try to splurge for one older star (and the wages he‚Äôd command), they‚Äôve continued to collect a ton of assets. What‚Äôs tough to figure out is what the end game is. You can‚Äôt turn assets into stars like you can in baseball or basketball.""

The column is written as a sort of Q&amp;A thing and the statement above is from a Grantland columnist Mike L. Goodman. I respect the Grantland staff a lot and Goodman writes a lot about soccer so I imagine he knows what he's talking about.

However, I disagree with his statement that ""You can't turn assets into stars like you can in baseball or basketball.""

I understand that in this sort of Q&amp;A style column, Goodman doesn't really have a chance to explain his statements in greater detail but a statement like that serves to discredit him.

(As one with a journalism background, you can understand why I'm trying to give Goodman the benefit of the doubt. Lol.)

But all the being said... Why in the world can't you turn assets into stars like in baseball or basketball?

What a confusing statement.

Baseball has a vast minor league system (like the reserve system in football) that develops assets into stars. In fact, in spite of my aforementioned theory on basketball, I think that it's harder to develop assets in basketball simply because there are far fewer spots on a team (5) and the lack of a strong ""minor league"" or ""reserve"" system in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

In soccer, you have 11 players with 38 League matches plus the Cup competitions. Furthermore, there is a strong reserve and/or Under-whatever-age system as well. Not to mention a loan system.

Because of all that, I believe, yes, you can collect assets in soccer and turn them into stars.

In fact, player development is a key part of every football club even for the richest clubs as well.

In terms of our club, we are clearly no longer in a position where we can simply lure the best stars like, say, Real Madrid or Barcelona or even Arsenal, Chelsea, etc. And we're not necessarily at the point where we are just *one* so-called ""marquee"" player away from a title and/or Champions League glory.

Therefore, instead of attempting to chase these stars (and ultimately overpay or be rejected by the player), we need as many assets as possible and continue to develop these players and develop our own stars. And at that point it's a bit of a numbers game... if we collect as many assets as possible, one or two are bound to become a star. (This goes back to the 50% transfer theory discussed in the Tomkins Times but it's a lengthy discussion for another time).

Anyhow. Long story short? Yes, soccer is very much a sport that can develop assets into stars. And that is something that Liverpool needs to do as well at this stage.

Regarding the question posed by the OP:

&gt;What exactly is the end-game to our strategy, especially if young stars we develop continue leaving (a la Sterling)?

First off, as I mentioned before, it's a numbers game: Collect and develop as many assets as possible and you're bound to develop a star amongst those assets. Especially for a club with resources like ours (not just money but coaches, facilities, history, etc.).

So, I guess what I'm saying is that you can't just get hung up on Raheem Sterling leaving the club. Sure, he has a bright future. And I think he'll be great. But... you have to look at players like Henderson, Coutinho, Ibe who have chosen to stay.

Frankly, Sterling leaving does not give me concern about our ""end-game strategy.""

The Liverpool Way is a vague, almost mythical concept that is regularly being bandied about as justification for one thing or another. However, what it certainly is not is LFC being ""technically the best, the most glamorous, the most attacking"" team in the land.

&gt;Originally, Shanks spoke of the Liverpool Way in explaining his focus on developing local talents instead of buying expensive 'outsiders'. Thereafter, the concept took on a deeper meaning as Shanks sought to create a bond between the club and the community. He sought to inculculate an esprit de corps between the players and the fans. To Shanks, playing for LFC is not simply a matter winning trophies - it was winning trophies for the community, for the city. This is why The Kop, and by extension, Anfield, is the most sacred sporting venue in the world. This is why the hair on the back of your neck rises the first time you walk into Anfield. This is why players sometimes say they cry listening to the fans singing YNWA. Because the fans know the players are playing for them. 

&gt;Shanks' Liverpool was far from the prettiest in the land. They were physical and supremely fit, and in most instances, just wore down their opponents. Spurs were the neutrals' favorite in 50s and 60s for their free flowing attacking football. Not us. Shank's Liverpool was built on the simple concept of ""pass and move"" and outlasting our opponents. My dad told me once that fans knew we would win a game if we're holding a lead three-quarters way through a match. We were not pretty, but men of great heart and character wore our jersey then, and fought like lions on the field for the fans. We were one of the few teams that could outmatch the physicality of Don Revie's Leeds. In fact, I am now trying to remember a quote by Shanks about Spurs - an insulting one. Maybe it'll come to me later.

&gt;Regardless, when Bob took over as manager, we more or less maintained the same approach, with one difference - we became possession demons. We became more inventive in the final third during Keegan's latter years as he became more influential. However, it wasn't until Kenny became player/manager in 1985 that Liverpool became an attacking team. This is one of the reasons why Kenny became much loved by the fans (aside from the goals and trophies); we became an even better attacking team than Koward Kendall's Everton or Ron Atkinson's United. The swashbuckling attacking teams of the late 80s were the icing on the cake.

&gt;The attacking approach ended during Souness reign as he sought to impose a little eye-talian flavor at Anfield. The appointment of Roy Evans coincided with the emergence of the Spice Boys (McManaman in particular), and we became an attacking team once again for a brief period of time, before our rearguard started leaking goals. Ged was brought in to 'assist' Evans in strengthening our fragile defence, but ultimately took over as manager. Ged and Rafa's reign, I'm sure everyone is familiar with them, so I'll leave it at that.

&gt;But the point is, the Liverpool Way has always revolve around the bond between the club and the fans. It was never about becoming the most glamorous attacking team in the land. If you believe that is The Liverpool Way, then you need to spend the next few weekends watching every available games from our past, read every word spoken by Shanks, and speak to every senior Liverpool fan you can find about the club.

Milner, Henderson, Lucas should be our midfield and Can should not be starting ahead of any of them in midfield as of right now.  He has an enormous amount of potential but he's not there yet and last season when he did play in midfield he failed to really impress.  Can also should 100% not play a DM role in league games right now.  He doesn't have the discipline yet and needs to learn the role.  Right now he is the exact same type of player as Milner/Henderson except not as good as either of them.  He got caught out too far up the pitch constantly when he played RB and the only reason he could bomb forward from CB on occasion is because in a back 3 there is cover for him which there wouldn't be if he went forward like that at DM.  Can can learn to be a great DM and he has all the ability he needs to do it just not the experience and discipline yet.  

Coutinho, Lallana , Firmino, and Benteke are fine as our forwards.  All of Lallana, Coutinho, and Firmino have the ability to play out wide and Coutinho is not even close to ineffective there.  One of his biggest strengths is his ability to beat his man and cut inside for a shot.  Look at all Coutinho's ""wonder"" goals from last season and every one happens from a position where he's drifted left and cut back inside for the shot.  The issue with playing Coutinho on the wing is that he isn't a true winger and neither are Lallana or Firmino which will make us too narrow at times since they all want to drift inside which against a defense that is sitting back doesn't stretch the defense like playing with true wide players does.  

Don't know what you mean by having too many players.  We have options and you can't really have too many quality players.  There is 0 point in being worried about the season.  No one expected a title challenge in 13/14 just like no one expected us to bomb out of Europe quite so spectacularly last year.  It's all up in the air till the season is under way and anything could happen.  

I see us playing either a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 next season.  Milner and Henderson as a double pivot in the 4-2-3-1 with all of Firmino, Lallana, and Coutinho on the pitch or a 4-3-3 with Lucas as a DM if we need more defensive solidarity.  It's the beauty of having decent depth for once.  Options.

The Government claims to be committed to ensuring the NHS provides the same service it does now, while claiming to improve it. But we sure as hell aren't going to pay for it.

Many people do not realise that the Government is completely capable of inventing bullshit statistics in support of our equally bullshit positions. We're just terrible at it, which is why even when we do the percentages are barely statistically significant, and we haven't even started to adjust for outside factors. But we're still going to use these bullshit statistics to make life worse for the people who literally save our damn lives every day.

We know we have to say on the record that NHS consultants are awesome, so we'll do that. But we just don't want to pay for more of them, so what we are going to do instead is force worse working hours on them and spread our staff thinner, because this is obviously a brilliant idea.

Last year, we paid some people to write official and intelligent sounding reports we could use to screw our healthcare personnel over. The DDRB and NHSPRB reports 'identified' a recent contractual right, that we just described as 'a decade old' to make it sound ancient, from barely two election periods ago, that allows senior doctors to refuse non-emergency work in the evenings, at nights and at weekends. This is an awful right to give workers. Of course employers should be able to force unsocial working hours on its employees! It's not like NHS workers have the right to properly protest, either, so we're just going to force this shit through. At this point we want to mention that junior doctors, nurses and other clinical groups have that right, just so we can try to put a wedge in here to break up our opposition. Divide and conquer, you know?

Now we hav to mention, again, that consultants are awesome people who save lives and make patients safer, because otherwise you might get annoyed at us and stuff. But let's get this back on track; did you know that doctors *gasp* MAKE MONEY?! To illustrate just how much money they make, we are going to refer to average wages for a group of workers that include specialists, which is going to massively inflate the numbers and make them seem to support our position. Let's not mention how it takes 19 years as a consultant to reach the highest wage threshold, not including further specialisation or clinical excellence awards, and that this threshold is still almost ¬£17,000 lower than the average mentioned. No need to mention these things. The public doesn't understand how statistics work, anyway.

The report said we should remove this right from doctors, because we told them to point at expensive things. And who knew worker's rights are expensive, right?

The new plans say that doctors will have a limit of 13 weekends worker per year, and since we are NOT AT ALL in it to make money we definitely won't be expecting hospitals to maximise their resources and mandate those 13 weeks. Nevermind that we literally just said earlier in this statement that this is what we want hospitals to do.

By the end of Parliament, we hope to have fucked over all the consultants and forced the new contracts on them. We're already screwing the other hospital staff over in a similar manner. It's not like they have any power to actually stop it from happening, right? I mean, they're just *people*. We're *rich politicians*! Oh, and here are a couple of token hospitals that we'll claim have done similar things and seen 'improvements'.

These new plans will move more doctors into what is essentially commission pay, and we will blatantly ignore all the science telling us that this is actually detrimental to productivity and work quality.

We also claim to improve weekend access to diagnostic services; make it easier to discharge patients on weekends; and better staffing cover in other clinical groups. Basically what we're saying is, we're not JUST going to be fucking over the consultants, but we'll be spreading thin ALL our staff and not paying a dime extra for it. The administrators in the NHS that we've hired to cut costs at all costs and not give a damn about the staff and patients, as well as the review bodies we paid to be 'independent', all tell us that stripping our most qualified personnel of their rights and forcing them to work more unsocial hours is vital.

The Government feels these changes are completely necessary to achieve our ultimate goal of completely collapsing both the NHS and public trust in the NHS, so that we can finally privatise everything and not just bother with this shit anymore. Because us rich people in Westminster really don't like that we have to pay for poor people's healthcare. It's just so... uncouth.

However, after a few embarrassing results in the new European competitions it was he who started the process of changing the style to a more possession based game.

null,false,DukePPUk,null,null,null,"Ok. Let's start again. The information we have is:

* claims that people knew the defendants would have been Asian,
* data suggesting 6-8 people a day are convicted of these specific offences,
* data suggesting 26-66% of those involved in this specific subset of offences (localised grooming) are Asian.

Do you not see that there is something wrong here? Maybe CEOP is completely wrong, and that 66% upper limit is still far too low. Maybe convictions for localised grooming are so rare that it is just a statistical anomaly that 'all' defendants are Asian, with all the other convictions for rape of a child, sexual assault of a child, sexual activity with a child being one-off incidents, or single defendants, or single victims. Or maybe there is a reporting bias creeping in somewhere between the events taking place and the perceptions of readers of this sub-reddit.

Then there was criticism of my suggestion that stories like this might not make reddit. Having gone through a few pages of Google News, most are about historic cases, but it seems that there are stories from [July](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-33408092), [June](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-32980515) and [May](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-32666720), involving gang-related child sexual abuse, which didn't appear on Reddit at all (unless the search is playing up).

And these are the stories that get reported by the BBC in the first place, never mind make it to the top of /r/uk.

Maybe I'm being overly-defensive, surely reporting biases or perception biases like this aren't really possible in the Internet age, given the wealth of information spread around - but maybe we can test that by considering a completely different issue; based on your perceptions from reading this sub-reddit, the news etc., what percentage of failed, foiled or successful terrorist attacks in the UK do you think relate to Islamic extremism?",null,0,null,1437817508,null,0,false,0,ctfkbha,null,t3_3eg6rb,null,t1_ctfkbha,null,t1_ctfjp2n,null,null,null,1440075204,null,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1,null

Perhaps there would be less food banks if Holyrood had control over welfare spending, taxation and employment? Perhaps there would be more time and funding to deal with these problems were it not for being stuck in a system that requires us to rely on UK funding while at the same time cuts are being made to areas like renewables, an area of investment primarily in Scotland, to stifle Scotland's potential growth post-referendum? Limited powers mean limited responses to problems. The rise of food banks in Scotland is a direct result of Westminster influence.

It also shifts the burden of penance from the managers (who committed the offence) onto the shareholders (who did nothing wrong). Thus punishing innocent people while reducing the deterrence, why would the managers be afraid of the regulators when they know they won't go to jail or pay any fines.

It also produces a perverse incentive for the regulators to settle and not to dig too far. The regulator will be under pressure from the treasury to pay for itself and the companies so scared of possibly losing a court case, and so their license, they will pay whatever amount the regulator wants. Thus the regulator needs only to threaten an investigation and the company will settle, meaning no real investigation is conducted and the company's behaviour is unlikely to change.

**TL;DR** This system does more long-term damage than the short-term gain of fines. It produces no legal precedents as it avoids the courts (instead everything is at the whim of the regulator), it shifts the burden of punishment onto shareholders who didn't commit the crime, it removes the deterrent effect of the law as managers no longer fear going to jail or being fined, the shallow investigation and quick settlements will not lead to any change in corporate management, the sheer arbitrariness of the system also means companies will become more secretive and less likely to own up to wrong doing.

Skunk: regulate THC/CBD ratio. It's not fucking difficult. You regulate the serving size of strong alcohol, why not do the same with strong weed.

Were it legalised, it'd be far more difficult for them to get hold of as the street dealers would be out of business and the cafes and pharmacies wouldn't want to sell to under 18s for fear of losing their licences.

Psychosis: Get me a study which doesn't have a bunch of people who've also used LSD and other hard drugs mixed into it and we'll talk.

Cracking down: This is expensive, and kind of pointless.

That's literally the case in very democracy. You elect a few people that run the country. The current government is the one the most people agree with. That's the whole point. Again, you don't seem to understand the system. Think about it, if seat proportional to votes for the parties (which is complete nonsense and fucking stupid) then UKIP and Tories would be the majority.

As both sets of people (those admitted at the weekend and those admitted during the week) have the exact same care over the weekend it seems there is no real deterioration of care at the weekends. 

They then considered the type of people who are admitted during the weekend compared to during the week. Those admitted during the week are likely to have been referred by a doctor and have gone to hospital at their own volition. Those who are admitted at the weekend weren't referred and were more likely to have come in emergency conditions. So you are comparing people going to hospital to have a routine hip replacement with people who went to the hospital because they have terrible abdominal pain as they have a perforated bowel. No one wonder then that people admitted at the weekend are more likely to die, they were in a more serious condition when they came in.

&gt;3.4.3 Harassment and discrimination

&gt;We asked if senior women had had any experience of discrimination or harassment from fellow judges, the Judicial Appointments Commission or Judicial Office.

&gt;One said:
‚ÄòI had one bad experience with a male member of the
judiciary when I was doing my judicial training. He made an inappropriate comment about my clothing and touched me a couple of times which I felt was unnecessary and over-familiar‚Äô.

&gt;One respondent mentioned she had encountered hostility in her role as a judge, she said she had received comments like...

&gt;‚ÄòWell you were appointed to make up the numbers... there are still many very able men... who cannot get appointed because they are not lesbians‚Äô.
 
&gt;This may explain the strong views against positive action measures.
Another observed, what she felt was mixed messaging from the JAC21

&gt;‚ÄòI am not entirely sure that when we are told that people who work part time are welcomed as part of the judiciary that is borne out in practice. The fact that I have to declare my income on some applications does not sit easily with that declaration‚Äô.

&gt;We checked whether any income information is required by the JAC22 in judicial applications and were told it is not. However yet again, the perception that it is may still act as a disincentive to those who would otherwise consider making an application and is a useful finding.

Report does conclude more on cuts to legal aid and issues with child care and lack of other senior women which may affect people confidence in promotion, which I'm sure we will debate if it's discrimination or not. Overall despite headline and reddit worries interesting look at life of women barristers and issues they face at work . Be interesting to see if any changes made from conclusion 


&gt;Findings suggest that women today have a very different and more positive experience in training to become a barrister and in their early years of practice. 

&gt;Those who had been in practice for some time talked
a hostile environment, inappropriate behaviours and discrimination in the allocation of work (particularly in crime by both clerks and solicitors) when they started their working lives. The Bar Standard‚Äôs Board equality rules (and changing societal attitudes) are seen to have supported huge improvements in women‚Äôs experience of the profession.

&gt;While many of the old challenges have been address, significant challenges still remain for women who choose to practice, particularly around balancing career and having a family; and in avoiding being pushed into certain types of work. The dominant cause for the attrition rate appears to be that practice is incompatible with having a family.

&gt;Different practice areas and different chambers‚Äô cultures clearly have a huge impact on women‚Äôs working environment and experience of the profession. With respect to chambers themselves, the lack of senior women appears to act as a hindrance to the implementation of fairer policies and practices and to disempower women in the profession.

&gt;Today the main barriers for women lie in publicly
funded practice, ironically the area in which women disproportionally most practice, with cuts to legal aid
and the cost/accessibility of childcare. The cuts in income make sustaining practice difficult. It was felt by many that the inconvenience of long hours (the inevitable evening and weekend working) and lack of flexibility are no longer compensated by income levels, that in the past enabled women to take longer breaks during school holidays and afford wrap-around childcare. These challenges are seen as insurmountable for many women and are effectively forcing women who are either unable to work full time and/or have caring responsibilities out of some parts of the profession.",null,0,null,1437819689,null,0,1437819946,0,ctfkrk6,null,t3_3ehkwg,null,t1_ctfkrk6,null,t3_3ehkwg,null,null,null,1440075414,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

Again, no we don't.  They might be convicted under the same statute, but let's not act like a guy who touched one child once is as newsworthy as an organized gang committing a large amount of connected offences.

This is like if someone said ""Why all the focus on Al Capone?  Murders happen every day, and don't get reported on.  This must be anti-Italian discrimination"".  When you start organizing, and doing it on mass, it gets a whole hell of a lot more newsworthy, regardless of the races involved.

&gt;Then there was criticism of my suggestion that stories like this might not make reddit.

[Here are some stories about white privileged males allegedly committing child sexual abuse in an organized fashion](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=westminster+ring&amp;restrict_sr=&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).

Unlike the Aylesbury case, where we have actual convictions, and the events we're discussing have been established in court, the Westminster story is largely hearsay, with almost no convictions.  Yet somehow it's already received far more attention on this website and in the news than the Aylesbury story likely ever will.

Why?  Anti-white guy bias?  No. It's because the British political elite perhaps raping children together is a lot more newsworthy than 6 unknown Asian men doing it, just as 6 Asian men doing it together is a lot more newsworthy than 6 random people across the country doing it separately.

&gt;based on your perceptions from reading this sub-reddit, the news etc., what percentage of failed, foiled or successful terrorist attacks in the UK do you think relate to Islamic extremism?

From the Trussel Trust, who monitor food bank use across the UK:

http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0044/00440458.pdf


""Figures published by the Trussell Trust indicate a sharply increasing level of demand for food aid in Scotland and other UK regions. In 2009, there was one Trussell Trust foodbank operating in Scotland. By October 2013, this had increased to 42 established and 17 in development. The Trussell Trust themselves suggest that, in order to fully address the food aid problem in the UK, 750-1,000 foodbanks would be required. As of October 2013,
there are around 400 Trussell Trust foodbanks across the UK. The number of foodbanks not affiliated to the Trust is unknown'

There was *one* Trussel Trust food bank in Scotland before the Tories came into power.

The number of food banks UK wide has increased tenfold since the Tories got in according to the Trussel Trust website. Since Holyrood doesn't control welfare spending, taxation or employment policy, the rise in food banks *is a direct result of conservative policies in Westminster*.

Page 9. Little excerpt:

&gt;Veretout has all the attributes that one would expect in a 
modern midfielder. He has the engine to be a true box-to-box 
midfielder, shielding his defence in one minute and supporting 
his attack in the next. He has the vision and passing ability to 
create chances for his forwards. And he has the sense of timing 
and the calmness in front of goal to appear to finish off team 
moves himself.

&gt;Sorry but all you done is been very vague. So far your argument can be summed up as ""Shit happens because... reasons"" past that you pretty much got nothing.

Wrong.

&gt;A ""general consensus"" which you shown no proof for.

Sure, nobody has ever discussed this anywhere, ever in the past fifty years...your agenda does not change that.

&gt;You yet to show it anymore than just your opinion. The fact that 113 nations apparently want Nuclear weapons prohibited and banned. Kind shows your general consensus to pretty much BS.

Not sure how fears over nuclear weapons = nuclear weapons have no effect on global peace 

&gt;Yeah that general consensus, must not include the UN

Try googling the right terms instead of ones based on your agenda.

&gt;Really doesn't add upto much of a general consensus when it seems to be most of the world vs the nuclear nations on wanting get rid of nuclear weapons. 

You're confusing the effect they've had with their desirability - not surprising considering you're still treating the subject as one that nobody has ever given any thought to until your arrival.

&gt;For something which apparently has a general consensus has stopped a ""world war III"" happening according to you.

There is no 'apparently', unless you have another theory as to how the end of WW2 or the cold war would have played out. Try googling that and you'll get very different results.

If you'd had anything of substance, it would have appeared by now. Enjoy.

This is kind of why I am supporting towards Burnham, an LVT would go a long way to solving inequality and simplifying the tax system.

They demanded to attend our site 1 week prior to the end date, to begin deleting software and data, starting with the primary database server. Oh and the 1 week of engineering time was to be a chargeable extra).

It might be coordinated and the endings decided, but it takes talent to do this kind of shit and make it look good:

That said, I wouldn't expect him to be a ""difference maker"" at the top level, but he's consistently solid. He's sort of like Milner in that respect, I think, but with a more limited skill set (because Milner can basically do everything).

Makes a few rash tackles but that's overstated a lot (look up how many red cards he actually has, and his average fouls per game), and has a tendency to make overly ambitious, somewhat-sloppy passes... but neither of those things are dealbreakers for a 25 year old, IMO. Might be less likely to do that with better players around him too. Less reason to try and do it all, you know?

Well yes, so the Green Deal should be replaced with something else that meets the goal better.

I hate the idea that people will be continually attacked for trying an idea, and then stopping it when it's clear it's not working as expected. That's sensible. 

You can attack the tories for not being green, but the key thing in this story should not be that they've cancelled a deal but what it may be replaced with. I don't know what the overall uptake was but this report seems to have the right figures in. Overall it seems very expensive for a relatively small number of homes actually involved, but I'm not really sure of the split between ECO and GD. Looks like ~40k homes in two years under GD, but the level of funding and the total number of assessments seems huge in comparison.

I contend that you are not, and that you can make no such statement.

Seriously, anyone who has ever worked the expenses in any reasonably sized organisation will know that lines on records mean squat. ""Biros"" means ""Biros, a couple of notebooks, 5 reams of paper, and someone asked me to get a box of staples just before I sent of the order"".

But looking at ""biros"" you might be forigven for wondering what sort of office needs that many pens.

I know people who have ordered computers as ""Office supplies"" because IT were being such a fucking pain in the ass about approving the expenditure.

* ""Are you sure you need this?""
* ""Yes, unless our new staff member is going to sit and tap an imaginary keyboard all day.""
* ""Who's paying for it?""
* ""We are - out of our departmental budget. Don't woryr, it's not an IT expense"".
* ""Yeah, still not sure we can give you approval for the new machine.""
* ""Fine, don't.""

¬£400 later, a basic box is procured from PC World, labelled as office supplies, meaning no sign-off from IT.

I'm just saying, in at least some of these cases he probably had onward journeys, and they probably gave the expenses office a manifest:

---Start---

1. Collect x from a and drive 0.7miles to b

2. Collect x from b and drive 100 miles to c

3. Wait during meeting, drive x to hotel d.

---End---

But they'll just jot down the first line as a reference, which means people then throw an absolute shit fit when they see it out of context - because they haven't seen the supporting documentation.

One thing I can guarantee - noone on this thread has the keys to the expenses ofice, wheich means none of us have actually seen the full documentation - just the excerpts the media have got their hands on.

Plus you were high as well, that must have been a shocker. Do yourself a favour and think about how you're going to get home in future.

Your caution will appear on a DBS (Disclosure and Barring Check) if requested by an employer in future. Most employers don't do these, they're expensive and so far really only used if working with children or vulneable people. Your caution won't mean you automatically fail the check, it will be noted however.

For your career, the SRA I think does a check when you register with them. Accepting a caution from the police is the lowest order in the list of things they may refuse your application for, but it is there. In my experience they are more concerned (obviously) with violent criminality and dishonesty, a caution for a railway bye-law is not their top priority. Don't let it put you off considering a legal career.

Whether your employer chooses to carry out further checks is up to them. Always be honest, even when you don't think their is any probability they will actually check the information they ask for. You will be committing another offence lying to them and if you're working as a solicitor that is fraud, and will mean the end of your career if the SRA gets wind of it.

A caution will remain on your criminal record forever, but becomes ""spent"" immediately, making it of lowest concern.

null,false,GingerSawr,null,null,null,"Coming back from his injury, he had to get used to not having the same amount of pace as before. However I don't think this was the main problem. He was never a player that relied on pace or agility. 

I think the main reason was Man United's tactics which did not revolve around him at all. At Atletico, everything was around him. At United, they played hoofball to a 5""9 striker, which will never work. If they didn't play it to him, they played it to Fellaini. I also think he didnt earn the trust of his teammates there. He actually made a lot of good runs but his team would choose not to pass to him. 

I'm confident he can come good again with us because I think Mourinho will know how to play with him, rather than just hope he'll score because of his rep. The difference between him and Torres is that Torres partially relied on his pace and agility to get around defences, and after his injuries he lost that. Falcao has never been about pace.

We don't hold that behaviour as inherent to all Christians. We don't claim that they are all genocidal slave holders because Jehovah encouraged genocide and slavery and Jesus wasn't all that condemning of the whole practice. 

Things? 

Sigh. It's simple. Paedophiles who abuse and run free do damage. If you cut the problem off early you affect less kids and indeed fewer paedophiles exist. I prefer to treat paedophilia as a medical problem and differentiate between paedophiles who abuse and those who do not. 

So you get a bunch of people who abuse children and since they are getting away with it they get more people inducted into the practice and wreak havoc because cops aren't doing their jobs. 

We saw the same problem with priests. No one policed them so they abused way more people than they should have. 

These men aren't all that religious. I mean you can't ""ape Mohammed"" and then drink and do drugs. This isn't pick and fucking mix. It's like demanding to follow the Sikh tradition of wearing a knife but not the one of the beard and hair. 

They were breaching really basic rules of Islam like drinking and drugs but we like to hold them as ""fundamentalist"" when most of these guys are not really all that well read.

The trouble is, I'm not sure there are many people who really want socialism any more, nor do I think that all those calling themselves socialists are necessarily socialist. What kind of socialist model do you strive for? The traditional Marxist model? NEP-without-the-murder socialism? The Nordic model (which is really a reformed capitalism)? Or something akin to SYRIZA? The Nordic model is often heralded as being a beacon of the socialist dream, but beyond the relatively high taxation, the role of the public sector, and the welfare state it is still a form of capitalism.

I don't think there is any real desire for true socialism - in the Marxist sense - any more. There's a desire for renationalising some industries and greater worker control, sure, but you'd have a hard time trying to convince people these days that everything that capitalism has done is wrong.

RvP had 10 goals and 2 assists in 2108 PL minutes. Falcao had 4 goals and 5 assists in 1288 minutes. Neither is stunning but Falcao's stats compare quite well to van Persie's stats, especially for Mourinho who likes strikers who can hold up the ball and play off his other attacking players. Personally I think a lot of United's issues last season came from a lack of pace. They had players who worked well in the box but they didn't have the kind of wingers that would allow them to best use those strikers hence Depay and their supposed interest in Pedro. Obviously Falcao and RvP are well past their best and I don't expect them to be 20 goal a season players in the PL but I do think both could have done better if the team around them was a better fit. I think Chelsea *is* a better fit since Falcao is likely to have fast and creative players around him to feed him the ball and when I saw him, he was making the right kind of moves and looking more deadly than, for instance, Drogba.

I'm sure confidence and adjusting to a lack of pace were big factors too but I think the true reason his stats are so unimpressive are that he didn't fit United's system. I don't think he's like Torres where he's just a broken player, I think he's more like Drogba now in that he'll never be as good as he was, but if he uses his skillset correctly he could still be an effective player in a niche role and I think Mourinho is banking off of this.",null,0,null,1437830447,null,0,false,0,ctfni1q,null,t3_3ejycn,null,t1_ctfni1q,null,t3_3ejycn,null,null,null,1440076703,null,11,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,11,null

null,false,multijoy,null,null,null,"What a recordable offence means is that if you're nicked for it, that fact will be recorded on PNC, regardless of the outcome. If you're nicked for (say) driving without insurance (assuming that there was some reason that it couldn't be dealt with without an arrest), and you were subsequently issued an FPN (as opposed to being charged there and then), then that fact won't (usually) appear on PNC.

However, an offence being recordable or not has no bearing on the disposal options - although you were nicked for a recordable offence (hence the fingerprints), you've been offered (and accepted) a caution for a non-recordable one. Both these facts will appear on PNC.

For the purposes of a disposal option, what matters is whether the offence is triable as a summary matter, an 'either way' matter or an indictable one. You can't caution for indictable offences, or some either way ones (without CPS authority), but summary offences are fair game.

With regards disclosure, you should have regard to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. Cautions are considered convictions for the purpose of disclosure, but they have the unique status of becoming immediately spent.

Broadly, you have no obligation to declare any spent conviction (which would include a caution the moment it was issued) unless the person asking the question is exempt from the ROA. This is generally any employer or volunteer organiser seeking to place people to work with children or vulnerable adults. This also includes positions of trust such as lawyers, accountants and some other categories of staff (a full list of which can be found on the DBS website). This does *not* include insurers, about whom the ombudsman said ""They can ask the question, but they have to ignore the answer"".

If you apply for a post that is exempted from the ROA and you fail to disclose a conviction and it is subsequently disclosed (either by an enhanced disclosure or some other means), then you'll probably lose the job. Organisations who are permitted to ask for a DBS disclosure are also obliged to sign up to the code of conduct relating to those disclosure, which require them to have a policy in place to manage an adverse disclosure; it shouldn't be part of the shortlisting phase but rather take place after they've made a decision to employ the individual.

Offences of dishonesty are far harder to 'spin' in a positive light than something like the railway equivalent of drunk and disorderly, where you can put your hands up and say ""One off mistake, hasn't happened before and hasn't happened since"" and you'll generally be able to stick it in the humorous anecdote file. The content of a disclosure is confidential, and if the company is doing it properly, that'll sit with HR and nobody else.

The decision to employ rests with the employer. They may look at someone and say ""Well, he seems nice enough and the Hatton Garden burglary really did show a lot of initiative"", but equally they might say ""Been arrested? For drunkenness? Get out!"". It's down to personal preference a lot of the time, but the DBS prefer that the question is asked once the company is invested in a new hire so as to allow a more nuanced approach rather than the shotgun ""has a conviction, bin the application"" approach.

Most supporters of a Palestinian state are not 'extremists' or even particularly religious, but treating them like potential ISIS fighters seems like a sure way to radicalise them and make them think that they might have more in common with others targeted by the British state. 

If we are going to do this anyway how about we start cracking down on pro-Israeli sentiment in schools as well? There are organisations [set up in this country](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-britons-fight-israel/18448) in order to facilitate the migration of our own pro-Israeli foreign fighters to wage war on behalf of a government which illegally occupies Palestinian land and commits war crimes in order to ensure that they continue to hold on to that land.

&gt; A report on counter-extremism policy published by the think-tank Claystone also cited the case of a teenager identified as requiring deradicalisation for attending a protest against an Israeli diplomat.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We've heard of the police going into schools to talk about Prevent to teachers and saying things like, 'If a kid thinks the West is at war with Islam it might be a cause for concern.' Or if a child goes on a demonstration against the bombing of Gaza, 'Keep an eye on him,'"" Alex Kenny of the National Union of Teachers told Al Jazeera.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is co-opting a range of non-security professionals to be the eyes and ears of the state,"" Bolloten told Al Jazeera
&gt; 
&gt; The boy, who is now 16, left school in June and intends to continue his studies elsewhere. Since then he said he had been visited at home by a Prevent officer and a case worker who identified himself as working for Channel, the programme for young people deemed vulnerable to radicalisation.
&gt; 
&gt; During the visit, the boy said the police officer had raised his voice when he and his mother spoke to each other in Persian, his mother's first language, telling the boy, ""Stop trying to be clever with me!""
&gt; 
&gt; He said he had been asked about his views about ISIL and the war in Syria even though he is a Shia Muslim, something which he believes most of those who questioned him did not fully understand.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The Channel officer was more understanding,"" said the boy.
&gt; 
&gt; ""He said they were happy that I was not 'the ISIS type'. He said if I had any concerns, maybe about friends, that I could call him. And he said, 'From now on nothing further is going to happen unless you do something similar.'

I don't see how that is relevant at all, you're going to have to explain that one further.

&gt; That's why there is no law against consumption or being under the influence of drugs (excluding vehicular laws ofc). Production, possession, and distribution are what are covered under current laws.

No the reason there's no laws against it being in your system is probably because there hasn't ever been a reliable way to test for it in recent times. I don't think it's because of some legal precedent and they have no problem doing you for having it in your system in places like Dubai. You're going to have to source that one mate.

&gt; The whole point of laws is that you cannot simply pick and choose which to follow and which to disregard.

3. Yorkshire Tea - A classic.

4. McVities Chocolate Digestives. Seriously combine 3 + 4 and you can pacify an Englishman in most situations. Additional points for making a drinking motion and saying Cuppa?
5. Heinz Beans, Heinz Tomato Soup. 

6. Brown Suace (HP Sauce)..semi essential for a fry up or bacon Sandwich. Acceptable Sauces are Heinz Tomato Sauce or HP. There is no Heinz there - speak to Manager immediately.

7. Any of those Chocolate Bars are Classics. Mars mostly. Bounty is love it or hate it.

I wonder how much the judges/ presenters know, not counting Simon because he obviously does. Murs *must* know, considering he went through the reality TV system. Cheryl most likely knows from how many times she's been a judge. Grimshaw (why is he a judge?) maybe; I don't recall him having much to do with these sorts of shows, but hey if they pay well then anyone is likely to turn a blind eye to the drama backstage. Ora probably too because the writer was someone from her year at school, and apparently she did reality TV auditions too.

I also wonder at what point it became so staged, whether it began like this or evolved into what it is now. I think probably the latter, since the producers could have just winged it and saw what was popular with the audience and what wasn't, then manufactured the things that got viewership up.

* Lure them in don't push them away. Make your side sound like the reasonable, responsible, civilised side and the other side sound like they are respectable but wrong.

* Your MP has to balance a lot of different forces (do other people feel this way, what do the people higher up in the party think, is there a PR risk of looking soft on crime etc). So try to reassure them that you respect what they think and understand their difficulties.

* Ethos, Logos, Pathos. Try to say that what you want is ethically the right thing to do, it is logically the right thing to do and that you feel it is the right thing to do, this is a classical technique and works very well.

So here is an example letter,

""Dear [Insert Name Here],

I am writing to you because I am worried about the problems caused by drug prohibition. I believe that prohibition contributes to criminal activity in this country and around the world and is therefore a bad policy. I also believe that drug addiction and it's associated harms are medical and mental health issues and should be treated as such, sending people who are already suffering to prison is only going to increase that suffering.

Moreover it is easy to obtain drugs in prisons, where there are 24 hour guards, gates and walls so prohibition does not achieve it's stated goals of removing drugs from our society. I believe people should be free to do as they please so long as they are not harming others and that they should have control over their own bodies. We should move to a policy of encouraging responsibility, as we do with alcohol and caffeine, for example. Cannabis is significantly safer than alcohol so it is responsible and reasonable to legalise it, remove this stream of funding for criminals and terrorists and allow our society to enjoy the freedoms which form the basis of our highest ideals.

I understand this is a complex issue and I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my letter, I appreciate that you are busy and that this is a contentious issue.

Thank you very much,

Yours faithfully,

null,false,Anandya,null,null,null,"It's simple. 

They aren't dying on the weekend. They are dying during the week. 
People who come to the hospitals on the weekends tend to either be idiots or the dying. Basically? 

What Jeremy Hunt is pushing is a part of a study that shows that patients are 16% more likely to die if admitted on the weekend which is horrifying if you don't know how the NHS works. 

See? On the weekend hospitals are STILL open. In fact hospitals are always staffed. What isn't staffed are outpatients. Hospital out patients don't run 24/7. It's acute services and wards DO run those hours. 

And on the weekend the only people admitting are critical care and acute services. Your Heart Attacks, Your Pulmonary Oedemas, Your Strokes, Your Sepsis. Your Polytrauma.

There isn't a cushion of simple disease that can be treated to soften this hammer blow so these patients get admitted on the weekend are cared for a few days and either recover or die. 

They however do not die on the weekend. They tend to die on the Wednesday. When the hospital (according to Jeremy) is fully staffed. But doctors know it's because these patients were spiralling the drain and doctors merely reduced the speed of the spiral. 

If you came in with an inflamed appendix or a fracture you wouldn't be left on a bed from friday night to monday morning. A General Surgeon or an Orthopaedic Surgeon would be on call to do the procedure. 

Even if you showed up with Steven Johnsons Syndrome (A Derm Emergency) the dermatologist would come in to treat you and they would draw up an emergency rota to care for you. 

It's an attempt to reduce our capacity for earning via unsocial hours, an extra cost to us particularly since we have the highest student debts and it is an attack on staff who cannot respond with hard strikes. In addition in demanding doctors work MORE hours beyond the 40 we are supposed to for no actual increase in pay (bear in mind we do not get overtime pay) he's making working conditions worse while making it harder to pay away debts. 

The fact is the current NHS crisis is a creation of Jeremy. Cutting NHS budgets meant that hospitals couldn't afford to hire the staff they needed. So they were forced to not take on as much staff. This meant they were short and in an emergency could get emergency funds for hiring locum staff which cost WAY more money. Jeremy is blaming locum staff who are mainly junior doctors trying to pay off a 80 to 100 K bill (YEAH. You can buy a freaking house outright with the cost of medical school in the UK right now and if you are poor you are taking a monster risk on the degree) as greedy when in reality there was no money in the buget for proper staffing levels. 

The best example? http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11184912/The-list-of-66-AandE-and-maternity-units-being-hit-by-cuts.html

Lucky it was A&amp;E that was over-run. If maternity was over-run we would have seen deaths. Surprisingly the majority of A&amp;E is very ""boring"" patients rather than the excitement of CPR. 

Note some of those closures were in freaking London. 

So he closes units. Creating a staffing crisis by cutting jobs forcing British doctors to seek alternative employment or leave to go abroad to work. 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9274753/Up-to-1000-new-doctors-could-face-unemployment.html

Now the problem is we are short. Short on staff. Short on funds. Short on infrastructure. Which means MORE money to fix the damn problem than was needed in the first place. 

In order to run the NHS 24/7 we would need nearly 3 times the number of doctors. We don't have that many doctors and we cannot even pay the ones we have properly (A newbie doctor earns 22 to 24K A year.) resulting in the USA and Australia and Middle East poaching doctors from us. Come to Dubai, enjoy all these perks and  this money. Or stay in Milton Keynes and struggle to pay your student loan. 

My fiancee's junior doctor ""banded"" post has a 9 to whenever work day and she apparently gets 2 days off every 12. Tell me? What planet are people on to think that is an acceptable work week? Whatever drugs Jeremy is on are mighty powerful, I want some.

Cameron's government is hell bent on an Orwellian approach to governing this country, something that had its roots with Thatcher and then taken up by Blair and despite being given 5 years of opportunity to change this strategy, he seeks to expand his reach ten fold into everybody's home in a way that presumes guilt before innocence by using the threat of the Middle East as a leaver. 

Cameron is demonising the poor and disadvantaged in order to prop up his concept of privileged capitalism where the ""proles"" are fed what ever shit is needed to keep building the ivory towers high enough to avoid the stench. 

Na - I don't care whether this is a ""echo chamber circle jerk"" or not, or really what ever you wish to term it.  I call it Orwellian.  I have read the book a few times, I see similarities and the label seems to fit quite well in my mind.  You can label his government as what ever you chose, it is but a label after all.

This bit annoyed me, you can pick any minority and claim they will be ""outvoted"" to then imply they're being ignored or suppressed.

It's all disappointing that the SNP seem to be doing a lot of flag waving now they're in Parliament, the campaign to get rid of ""braying"" and voting in person seems awfully similar to the renaming of 'French fries' to 'Freedom fries' in the United States Congress.

The bedroom tax, could have been done without causing the level of chaos it has.

Universal Credit, maybe didn't need to waste billions on it.

Sanctions, fair if someone's genuinely and deliberately avoiding their responsibility to seek work, not so much if they were in hospital at the time or at a job interview.

Assessing sick and disabled people's fit for work ability.  Perhaps if they don't show, find out why before dismissing them, then you don't find out later they were having a heart attack and in hospital.
Perhaps don't find someone 'fit for work' because they left the interview halfway thru... on a stretcher, to the emergency room.

Workfare, how about limiting it to only charities and community projects and limit it to 2 days a week, in line with minimum wage?

null,false,egoisillusion,null,null,null,"1. If we can stay reasonably healthy, which hasn't been the case the past few seasons, I would say a top 10 finish is realistic and a top 8 finish is optimistic.

2. I believe Payet will be a breakout player in the league this year. He has the chance to be a top playmaker, and I can see him making the team a lot more fun to watch on the offensive end. I am hopeful that he will be the linchpin that will draw more talent to the club and raise the level of players around him.

3. It looks like we've been favoring a 4-2-3-1 in recent games. I'd expect to stick with that for the most part, but I can see us using two strikers sometimes. The question of who will be starting is very much up for grabs and I'd expect a lot of lineup changes and experimentation in the early season. We have a lot of competition for places, and we can't even be sure who the captain will be going into the season.

That said, I'd expect something like this:

Sakho

Valencia - Payet - Zarate

Kouyate - Noble

Cresswell - Reid - Tomkins - Jenkinson

Adrian

The sure starters in our lineup will be Sakho, Payet, Kouyate, Cresswell, Reid, Jenkinson, and Adrian. The wingers are the biggest question mark right now.

Why is it any of your business if I want to be stupid or lazy? A large part of the problem at present is that, weed being illegal, growing it is difficult. Growers need to grow denser and stronger crops to offset risk and maximise profit. People breed for strength instead of quality and that's where a lot of the negatives you mention come from. Government control has literally made this worse. If it were legal it would be controlled like any food or drink and clearly labelled. 

Note that I'm not calling you stupid or dense, just saying you're being dense. I'm guilty of being dense a lot of the time, it's not so bad really. I barely ever smoke weed or do any drugs, really.

As for tips, do lots of research. There are websites that give information about [insurance groups for individual car models](http://www.parkers.co.uk/cars/insurance/car-insurance-groups/). Each insurer will have slightly different bands, but it's always worth checking out that car before you buy it. 

If you see a car showroom that advertises a car with ""low insurance"", don't just assume that'll be the cheapest to insure. 

Once you have narrowed down the car choices (or found *the one*) run them through something like confused.com or similar, with your details, and see what that price is. Then try another, moneysupermarket, compare the market, go compare... You get the idea. Try enquiring with the company that insures your parents if they do multi car discount. Just get as many prices as possible. 

Then go for the one that looks the best deal. ¬£20 extra for a courtesy car? Probably a good thing. ¬£200 windscreen excess? Best to shy away. 

TL;DR: research and get lots of quotes. 

Edit: DONT LIE. Saying you park in a secure garage will probably lower the price. But if you don't have a garage, and then have to claim (for anything, not just theft) you leave yourself liable to get nothing.

Waving flags mean nothing unless there's a credible threat attached to them.

&gt;You mean all those people that borrowed an excessive amount of money, bought stuff with it that they couldn't afford and then never paid it back again?

You realised the banks actively encouraged knowing the outcome and the financial benefit they would get from it.

&gt;So you are admitting that Occupy is a terror organization because I'm sure there were people there that are okay with violence. So ""guilty by association"", hence the police is correct either way.

Nope, you seem to have a comprehension issue here. By putting them in the same slide, the police are implying an equivalence between then and ISIS.

&gt;The current government is the one the most people agree with

If by most you mean ~37% of the votes then sure. 

&gt;Again, you don't seem to understand the system.

Honestly I think you need to re-educate yourself if you think FPTP is [the best we can do](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7679C7ACE93A5638).

&gt;if seat proportional to votes for the parties (which is complete nonsense and fucking stupid) then UKIP and Tories would be the majority. Hence the government would be even more right wing and even less people happy with it.

No outcome is desireable for all, that's side-effect of democracy. At least it would have been a **fair representation of the will of the people.**

&gt;What kind of bullshit is that?! You are the one that rejects democracy

Please tell me where I rejected democracy by suggesting that the country's parliament should be more representative of the will of the people? You seem to have a reading comprehension problem drawing all these strawmen and incorrect assumptions about me. Fyi I don't align myself with a lot of what Occupy believe, but I don't think they're a threat like ISIS.

2013 total = 606Tw 357Tw fossil fuel 249 renewable = 41.1%

2014 total = 583 Tw 329Tw fossil fuel 254 renewable = 43.57%

Weed isn't ""highly"" addictive, but it definitely is mentally addictive, and there are no physical withdrawal effects, but it's definitely an addictive substance, just like most drugs. For most people who struggle, it isn't ""just a choice"", it affects them differently to you. 

You can't just pretend like your experiences are the same for everyone, that's just not how it works. In fact, I'd attribute most of the issue to people who keep preaching that marijuana is like this wonder drug that's perfectly fine as long as you're ok with it. 

It makes people think they can handle it and that them smoking a lot is fine because it doesn't mean anything. I understand that you're arguing against people who think that weed's worse than it is, but you're at the same time reinforcing the actuall issues that exist with weed.

I'm not saying it's your fault, or even that you should stop, and I'm not even trying to impact you in any way, really, I'm just trying to let you know that you shouldn't pretend like weed's not an issue for these people when it most certainly is. 

People can handle it. People can handle alcohol. Shit, people can handle heroine and coke. *Should they*? Fuck no. This isn't an argument for making weed illegal, I think it should be legal and in fact I do think it's a pretty damn good drug compared to smoking and drinking, I just think that if it does become legal there needs to be education given about the effects that marijuana can have on you, and try to teach people the importance of moderation.

/rant

TL;DR: Weed isn't a wonder drug, it's most certainly addictive and most definitely can harm lives and saying ""it's the person's choice"" is like saying ""maybe the guy in poverty *shouldn't* have robbed that guy and gone to jail"". Circumstance is important. Weed should be legal, but there should be education given about it, too. **It's not a miracle drug. It has issues.** But they can hopefully be fixed if it becomes legal.",null,0,null,1437837170,null,0,1437837393,0,ctfq6i0,null,t3_3ejc8o,null,t1_ctfq6i0,null,t1_ctfnd5s,null,null,null,1440077966,null,-8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-8,null

You pay a ¬£5 deposit fee on their end and whatever your bank charges to send a wire.. maybe only ¬£10 if you're lucky (lloyds, natwest). The important part is that there are no fx fees since it's all in GBP. If you then send ¬£1500 in one go you'll only be paying 1%. If that's too much maybe you can try and sell some of it back on localbitcoins or club together with someone else.

If you are able to meet the requirements this can be optimized further by getting a [lloyds international current account](http://international.lloydsbank.com/international-current-accounts/) which has no SWIFT transfer fees.. so you're now only paying the ¬£5 deposit fee. 

Another method is to try and find services that still work with transferwise/currencyfair.. you can get an account with cryptocapital.co - which gives you your own unique Polish IBAN number associated with your account. Since everyone's number is unique they are probably less likely to be banned by services such as transferwise/currencyfair etc. Once the funds are in cryptocapital you can transfer them to coinapult.com to buy BTC. For this option it is best to use euros because everything is in the sepa zone and the fx fees on transferwise/currencyfair are very low. I have not used this recently but I suspect that it still works fine and you can create new IBANs instantly on cryptocapital so if one does get banned it's easy to make a new one.

* The chocolate orange bars at the bottom of image 6 are delicious. I've no idea if you already have Terry's chocolate oranges in the US though?

* HP sauce is amazing on a bacon sandwich.

* Heinz baked beans are great on toast and can be had for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Worth a try for sure. Grated cheese on top makes them even better!

* Vimto is amazing, but very sweet, so I wouldn't get it unless you like that kind of thing.

It's actually very simply to disprove too. 60 years ago, almost nobody in the UK smoked cannabis at all. Now, approximately 2.5 million people in the UK smoke cannabis regularly. So if cannabis is causing cases of Schizophrenia that wouldn't have otherwise occurred in even just a small percentage of users, you would expect to see a significant increase in the number of people diagnosed in the UK today vs 60 years ago, right? There has been no such increase. Schizophrenia diagnosis rates are the same as they've been for decades.

Basically we have some super rich guy who has a Swiss account. He transfers ¬£1m over, then uses it to buy ¬£1m of shares in BT or whatever. So BT has share certificates in the name of some Swiss trust, and HMRC don't get to know to tax the dividends (nor do they ask where the original ¬£1m came from). 

Without the tax haven, the rich guy just buys the shares in BT directly. The start and end points to the money do not change, the route through the haven just dodges tax. 

Even if the guy was just putting money into a Swiss deposit savings bank account, the Swiss bank uses it to invest somewhere in an economy and make a profit, hence they can pay him interest. 

It's likely the figures are inflated because the paper trail for some money will cross through havens multiple times. Such as a guy who transfers money into his ""Swiss Holdings Trust"", which in turn controls ""Swiss Property Investment Trust"" which then uses the money to buy some property in London. The Holdings and Property trusts hence each have an asset of ¬£1m and anyone collecting stats does not have any information to realise it is the *same* ¬£1m, so it gets counted as ¬£2m, but actually there's nothing really there in any economic sense - the ¬£1m got released back in to UK economy via London property market.

null,false,wheelyjoe,null,null,null,"Weed is addictive in the same way masturbating is addictive, sure you aren't addicted to it, but you go without for a few weeks after having discovered it and see how you feel about doing it again. 

Also, I have to say it sounds a lot like you've read about weed without actually experiencing it, it's not analogous to drinking alcohol, in the same way drinking coffee isn't, they're both mind altering substances but the effects are worlds apart.

Weed is very rarely the issue, if a guy jumps off a bridge after smoking a bowl you gotta ask what else was going on in that guy's life, weed is only mentioned on between 0 - 2 coroners reports in the UK every year, and even then it's not listed a cause of death, so it's not inherently dangerous, bar the obvious dangers of smoking, particularly with tobacco, but there are plenty of other ways to consume cannabis that remove that risk. 

More often it is a sign that someone is unhappy in some way, I know my use goes up when I am, but that's the same as anything people enjoy, be it alcohol, comfort eating, working out a lot, playing video games, whatever it is that people do to escape a bit. 

There is some social harm in taking it too far, sure, but again it's just the same as everything else people do, you could hurt yourself working out, should you stop? You could get carpel tunnel from gaming, does that mean it needs regulation? You'll almost certainly do some damage drinking regularly, but that's alright. 

You just have to look at the statistics for crime rate, incarceration rate, tax income, the increase in school funding, the savings in police work/time, and everything else in Colorado, or other US states that have legalised to see the benefits FAR outweigh the problems that some individuals will have, that they would probably just turn to something else for if cannabis wasn't legal.

Maths A should bring you up to speed. It's a nice course and it basically takes off where A-Level Maths finishes.

Personally, I would advise against cramming anything in, enjoy your summer! You might have to work harder in Maths/Physics on account of your background - but I'm not sure if cramming in September is going to change anything (perhaps it might, but I have my doubts).

Instead, focus on the material they send when results come out. There is a workbook which will assess the things you do and don't know. For things you don't know, *speak* with your supervisor, they are there to teach and you are there to learn.

I also wouldn't worry about anyone else being a 'FM god', if they are, it might be better to use it as an opportunity to learn.

Although the course doesn't require further maths, it obviously helps.

Although, yes, you will be at a disadvantage not having done fm, it is completely possible for you not to 'cram' this summer and just go in and do fine.

However, if you have bits and pieces of free time, have a look at m2 if you haven't done it (since they don't really do mechanics in physics but there's usually a nice mechanics question on the paper). Also have a look at vectors (cross products especially), keep on top of your integration and maybe even have a quick look s2 for the probability section.

In all honesty, it's more important to just keep on top of what you've already learnt and not forget anything (that goes for all your subjects, not just maths) - make sure that you don't forget how to integrate, differentiate and MOST IMPORTANTLY don't forget your trig identities.

null,false,major_pants,null,null,null,"I'll give it a go. I am not a lawyer but am pretty familiar with option schemes.

In simplest terms EMI schemes give you options over shares in a company in a tax efficient manner - i.e. you are not taxed at the time you are granted or you exercise (convert them to shares) the options. You then pay capital gains tax when you sell the shares, although if you have over 5% you will qualify for [entrepreneurs' relief](https://www.gov.uk/entrepreneurs-relief) and only pay 10% tax on the sale.

Option schemes normally have a number of features that are important to understand:

**Exercise price** - the price per share you pay to convert the options into shares. Find out (from Companies House filings if the owner won't tell you) how many shares there are, multiply that by the exercise price to understand the value the business needs to have before your options are in the money. e.g. you have options at ¬£10 in a company with 1,000 shares, if the equity value of that business is ¬£5,000 your options are worthless because you would spend more money exercising your options that you would just buying shares.

**Share class** - the class of shares your options convert into. Into a venture capital backed company there can be a number of different share classes that can really change the way the value is distributed between the shareholders.

**Vesting period** - often options vest (become yours) over a period of time for you to then exercise. Three years is a fairly standard period, in extreme cases they may only vest on sale of the company. i.e. you can only exercise your options and then sell the shares when the company is being sold. If you have 3,000 options vesting annually over three years, then in month 13 you could choose to exercise 1,000 of your options. If the company is public you could then sell those shares (subject to any other restrictions you are working under), or hold them and be entitled to vote on shareholder matters and qualify for dividends (depending on the share class).

**Expiry** - sometimes options expire, there is a time limit within which they much be exercised. This is obviously something to keep an eye on to make sure you don't miss out.

It is typical that all your options expire when you resign, so if some have vested you may wish to exercise them before resigning (as long as you understand the good leaver/bad leaver provisions) and have a sensible view as to whether they are currently or are likely to be 'in the money' (share price higher than the exercise price)

Before you exercise options you should understand a few details about the company. There may be an investment agreement that you would become party to on exercising the shares, and you should understand the articles of the company which may have very important restrictions, including good leaver/bad leaver. This covers what happens to your shares when you leave the company, and can range from you having to give them back at cost (exercise price), to being forced to sell them at current market value to the other shareholders, to being allowed to keep them.

In a VC-backed business it is likely that the company will be sold (or fail). In an owner-managed or family owned business they may never intend to sell the company in which case having shares is not necessarily very useful. In a public company you can exercise the shares and sell them (usually with some restrictions to avoid market abuse) on the open market to convert them to cash.

If you want to give any more details of the type of company you're in I may be able to give other info. For example what you should do with options in a VC-backed private company, in a public company or in a family company is often quite different. 

I don't know your level of understanding generally, but I should emphasise that there is never any possible downside to having EMI share options (i.e. no risk of tax on gains you haven't yet made etc.) which can be the case with non-EMI share options. Worst case you never exercise them.

Normally there is no cost to the employee to receive the grant (and no tax) and only something to pay at exercise, with tax if the exercise price is less than the market value at the date of grant.  With this is mind there is unlikely to be any negative side for the employee to be issued with the grant.

Regarding the exercise price point raised by /u/major_pants, it is likely that a valuation for the shares has been agreed in advance with HMRC, and I would not worry about this figure adding up to net assets on a balance sheet as there are likely to be many other issues in play to think about, not least how much the business is going to be worth at the time you exercise

Essentially, unless you have extensive experience with marijuana or have access to reliable numbers that I haven't seen, your opinion doesn't hold much weight.

All intoxicants are going to have effects on a person's life, and in reality no one is saying otherwise except the strawman you're talking to.

I went to a couple when I first moved to my area, and I met lots of people there as well as finding out about all the good local pubs/places to avoid, things like that. Also, depending on where you live, I've met a lot of people just at the pub. English people can be unsociable, especially if you live in places like London (I have discovered this because I myself am loud and probably too friendly) but in most pubs if you talk to people they will talk back, and then sometimes you get lucky and end up making a friend.

The Friends of al-Aqsa seem to have quite a few links to Hamas and Hezbollah.

The reason they hate Hamas is because they refuse to be subjugated, occupied by the Israeli state, and we salute Hamas for standing up to Israel.‚Äù

There seems to be quite a bit further about them online, but the above seems a telling enough summary. Basically continues in the same vein with lots of anti-Semitism and terrorist organisation links.

Each year I would get more and more invested and it just so happened that my last year of college was the Munich season. Because of our busy study schedules one of the only games we didn't watch together was the Barca second leg. I was so excited when we went thru that I went straight to my phone to text him about it.. and he replied, ""Catch me on campus tomorrow with my Drogba jersey on"" (because Drogba was his favorite player). That was the last message I ever received from him. Before I could see him, he was killed riding his motorcycle home by a driver who failed to look both ways and pulled out in front of him. After that, the only thing that brought any sort of solace or happiness to my life was anticipation of the next Chelsea games. When I sat down to watch the final, I was a wreck. I can't explain how I felt when Drogba put that header in and I can't tell you how close to home the commentary was when he put the penalty away. I truly felt that it was written in the stars and I truly felt that my friend was watching. It brought tears and happiness to my life when I needed it the most.

To be honest, I suspect his objection is mostly because he doesn't want to believe the results and so is insisting on a much higher standard of evidence than would normally be required.  This type of objection sounds 'scientific', but unless there's some good indication that the criticism might be true, then I'd be inclined to dismiss it as quibbling.

&gt;I'll hold judgement until they identity the genes responsible, but I'm not holding my breath.

OK, but it's not science's job to convince you personally.  You're free to have an opinion, but it's still just an opinion, which has no bearing on the actual science.

Edit:  [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study#Assumptions) - 

&gt;It can be seen from the modeling above, the main assumption of the twin study is that of equal environments. This assumption has been directly tested. A special case occurs where parents believe their twins to be non-identical when in fact they are genetically identical. Studies of a range of psychological traits indicate that these children remain as concordant as MZ twins raised by parents who treated them as identical.[17]

&gt;Molecular genetic methods of heritability estimation have offered some evidence that the equal environments assumption of the classic twin design may be sound.[18]",null,0,null,1437845034,null,0,1437846345,0,ctfu4xq,null,t3_3ekaoo,null,t1_ctfu4xq,null,t1_ctfsjt0,null,null,null,1440079895,null,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14,null

Many clubs have tons of young guys who come through the ranks and don't break out. Liverpool has had success recently with Sterling and Ibe but our defense hasn't panned out as well (you can't expect to consistently produce young players into starting squad members). Also alot of young guys we have signed have only been here one year and were also in their first PL season. The PL is notorious for being one of the hardest leagues to transition into.

Remember also Flanagan was putting in some good performances before falling to injury as well (another thing out of Rodgers control). 

As for Skrtel being in his prime, I disagree. While most players are reaching their prime around 28-30, they are also usually more technically sound. Skrtel relies alot more on reacting to a player and using his physical ability to win the ball as oppose to reading the play.

Who are the people? The Scottish have made it very clear they as a group (or a nation) electorally are very different to the English. Likewise in NI, we have more in common with the Scottish than we do with the English. Even in England, attitudes are different north and south. The Welsh, fuck knows, ask them!

I'm not sure who the people really are. The UK public combined have never been so polarised politically as they are now since maybe the start of the previous century up to the 1920s when the first Labour government was elected, Irish home rule/partition caused a civil war in Ireland and the breakaway of a large portion of the union for independence, and the political scene was stuck between fascist supporting groups, communist supporting groups, and the status quo (the winner in the end), who were genuinely afraid of either.

Liberalism as a political view is often tossed around with words like ""lefty"" though, so really I don't think the party has a definitive right or left position, and that isn't a bad thing. What I have liked about the Liberal Democrats, at least under Clegg but we have yet to see Farron's direction so who knows going forward, is that they have the heart of the left with the sensibilities of the right. 

They were for implementing austerity, which at the time was probably necessary. I'm not an economist, but surely Greece is a lesson there. That said, they are not like the Tories who do so with a clear ideological slant. Many of their policies are downright economic cleansing of the poor!

Doesn't make a difference. If I watch BBC UK, and then watch BBC China, I expect the same level of quality. I believe the same quality should be upheld across all versions of the same source.

&gt;None of these examples really demonstrate any kind of bias which would affect the story unless you are alleging that it is completely unsubstantiated.

Yes they do, you just seem to be as biased as to not see the blatant biases of Al Jazeera. 

&gt;I like everyone else do have a bias, yes, although it is certainly not a bias which is particularly sympathetic to Salafism! Given that you are seemingly incapable of writing the word Palestine without quotation marks I you seem to be carrying a significant amount of bias on this subject yourself!


Absolutely, I am biased, as is everyone.    

&gt;If you'd read the actual story then you would have read that one of the students targeted is a Shia Muslim, so if you're are alleging that there is some sort of Salafist agenda at play in posting the article then I am a bit nonplussed about what is going on there.

Nope, just thought I'd include what I see as interesting facts about Qatar, which Al Jazeera is practically a state media of. 

&gt;In any case, the report is coming from a Think Tank originally anyway so maybe you can target them rather than obsessing over Al-Jazeera.

Well, the fact is they used Al Jazeera as a source in the report:

&gt;One schoolboy told **Al Jazeera** he was accused of holding ""terrorist-like"" views by a police officer who questioned him for taking leaflets into school promoting a boycott of Israel.

&gt;**Al Jazeera** is not naming the student or the school to protect his identity.

&gt;**Al Jazeera** has identified other examples suggesting that Palestine-related activism is something that teachers and public officials are being encouraged to look out for as part of their Prevent duties.



&gt;Alex Kenny of the National Union of Teachers told **Al Jazeera**.

&gt;Bsis told **Al Jazeera**. 


&gt;Bolloten told **Al Jazeera.**

&gt; the Department for Education told **Al Jazeera**



I do believe the government are monitoring students, as that is the action the government is taking. I do not however believe that due to their support for ""palestine"" is a reason many students are being accused of radicalisation and support for terror groups. If they openly shown support for Hamas, then sure that's support for a terror group.

Do people who get sent to Eton do well because they were sent to Eton, or because the people who can be sent to Eton will do well anyway? That would beg the question ""If they're going to do well anyway, what do they need Eton for?"" and ignores the possibility that Eton might actually be improving them.

You're looking at it from the wrong angle like many do. Gold is not apocalypse money. It is get the fuck out of dodge money this is why RAF airmen and SAS soldiers carry gold sovs when they go on missions. It is because it is fungible and recognised even by primitive tribes. 

It is also seed money. In a big collapse situation he who loses least is the biggest winner. If you have gold and the currency of your country collapses you have options to buy your way out the country or even do a Pengo and stuff it up your bum and wait for it to all blow over. A collapse may well be localised such as Argentina, or Zimbabwe. Gold can get you out of there and or preserve some of your wealth.

Just look at Ukraine they had a 50% devaluation overnight. Same with Russians a 60% devaluation which stabilised at a 30% devaluation. Nobody wants the bits of paper. But I can change my gold pile into US$, GBP, Euros anything I want. This buys food or a ticket outta there.

A lot of westerners don't recognise problems because many of them have never happened or are a very long time ago and therefore something you think is implausible.

China for instance oh they're evil in China they eat anything that moves. You know why they eat anything that moves? Massive MASSIVE famines for 2000 years. The last big one was in 1961 in living memory. Funny enough one of my ancestors did have gold and what did he do? He bought his way into Hong Kong to escape.

Similarly China invented paper money. The last hyperinflation happened 60 years ago again living memory. Those with gold on my mother's side? They bought their way out of the country and escaped to Taiwan.


And yes I do own gold not a gigantic pile. As said should something terrible happen I can leave at a whim. Where to? My homeland which is a highly defensible village in the mountains with enough arable land to support the entire population and several wells.

As a relatively new fan (last decade) I have mainly seen us fall behind the competition. Whether it is due to sugar daddy owners or teams moving into bigger stadiums. I love the fact that our club has the one of the greatest, if not the greatest history, in the world, but there comes a time where you have to be able to compete with the top in order to continue our legacy. 

With owners who aren't loaded with oil money and a redeveloped stadium that will still fall short in terms of capacity, the owners have to find every avenue of revenue possible. I'm sure that if the owners didn't weren't as concerned with disrespecting the fans, we'd already have a new name. 

Hypothetically, lets say we got a gigantic offer (100M?/200M? a year?!) to be renamed ""blankety blank corporation park at Anfield"". Lets say that money allowed us to:

- Buy some of the best players in the world
- Compete on a wage level
- KEEP our current best players
- Get us back into the title race year in year out

Why would you say no to that in order to uphold history? 

Shouldn't you want to do anything at all costs to continue the legacy of success we have had in the past, so that we aren't just referring to our success from decades ago?

""after the first year"" isn't a particularly honest way to make a point.  A Porsche Boxster will be, at minimum, somewhere around 180g/km.  In it's first year it'll owe ¬£800 in VED.  A Prius will be about 90g/km, so ¬£100-¬£120 in its first year. 

So over ten years, the Porsche will pay ¬£800 + ¬£1,260 = ¬£2,060 (fag packet maths).  The Toyota will pay ¬£120 + ¬£1,260 = ¬£1,380.

Over both cars' lifetimes, when you include the fact that the Porsche will be significantly less economical than the Toyota, the latter will be taxed far, far less.  And that's just one of the cheapest, least polluting Porsches around.  The figures will be significantly further apart if you calculate it for a Cayenne or a 911.

Social workers and carers are ridiculously overworked, treated like shit, and not paid enough. The turnaround of staff is huge, loads of social workers become depressed. I remember the Baby P incident, the tabloids and news (inevitably followed by the public) launched an attack on social workers and they were treated as the latest 'public hate figure' for a month or so, as if they were all collectively responsible. It's generally a depressing job.

When you combine that with the lack of evidence-based policies in certain areas and the lack of funding, not to mention the lack of future for these mentally ill people in todays society, it's bound to be a poor service that doesn't provide for everyone, which in the long-run costs more because you have the police and other services having to deal with people.

We could put more money into our care industry and provide well paid jobs for the carers and social workers and free education for those wishing to become carers, or we could do what the neoliberals have done and gradually privatise everything, leading to corporations running the CARE industry for PROFIT, two words that don't go together. 

Most people don't realise how much the care industry has been privatised. There's a big care provider that came over here a few years ago and got big government contracts for mental health / learning disability care, then traded on the stock exchange. They've grown like crazy and now have thousands living in permanent care in their homes , they're so big they house people for their entire lives, from young kids to adults. 

The carers are good but most haven't had pay rises in years, and they're overworked (not to mention it's a stressful job anyway) , lot's of them are on minimum wage, despite the fact the company is earning shit loads and growing. The company advertised for foreign staff to come in because they couldn't get the workers on that wage in this country, they put a notice up asking their underpaid carers to give accommodation to these foreign workers, and not only that, dictated the price they should charge them. The managers are all managerial graduate types who don't understand the industry and get paid very good salaries.

The companies procedure of care is a one size fits all approach, and doesn't really give the individual care required, everything is checklists and procedure. Not to mention the patients with learning disabilities don't react well to foreign staff FOTB, because they can't understand them. 

The government gives this company up to ¬£200,000 per patient, per year. This is the Tory dream - private industry running everything for profit for them and their friends. We literally give the rich money in all areas of industry, we're a socialist country, but for business not people.

Another option is to try to do without the foaming cleanser, by adding an emulsifier (mix oil and water, eg. polysorbate or cromollient) to the oil  or by using the same micellar water for your second cleanse. An alternative would be the [Superdrug B Clean Melting Gel Cleanser] (http://www.superdrug.com/B-/B-Clean-Melting-Gel-Cleanser-125ml/p/548850#.VbPnw9JViko) (currently on offer at ¬£3.50, I would not pay full price). It is primarily mineral oil, the emulsifier is based on sugar so is hydrating.

For dry patches [Eucerin 5% urea face cream] (http://www.eucerin.co.uk/products/urea/smoothing-face-cream-5percent-urea) - in a 50ml tube - urea gently exfoliates and hydrates dry or eczematous skin.

There's plenty of need for reform in parliament in many areas. The insular culture is a barrier to many people understanding politics at all. A reform culture should be promoted, and this is a tiny part of that. I'm no fan of the SNP, but I do feel the major parties and the system as a whole needs shaking up.

It is also well worth getting chatty with the local shopkeepers - not necessarily checkout staff at Tesco, but in community shops on the high street, the shop keepers are a fantastic source of local information. Your vicar will also know about things, as will the local charities - and volunteering at the local charity shops is a great way too.

Given the refining process involves heating oil, I wouldn't be surprised if it just hadn't fully cooled down before delivery. Large volumes can hold warmth for a long time, and in winter it would have to cool down more to reach air temperature.

I don't disagree with that (it's true). What I'm saying is that it doesn't make them under-represented. If there are more voters in the older demographics (and there are), then it's natural that they should have influence.

Fundamentally, however, this isn't how parliament operates anyway, as we vote along party lines. Young people are, therefore, represented as much as their political views are, as opposed to by their age. Perhaps evidenced by the number of young people getting behind 66 year old Jeremy Corbyn.

In the case of switching from physical to electronic voting, the gain seems to be so incredibly small, exactly because of the small scale you cite. Even a relatively small cost is hard to justify, though I still think the cost would spiral, given the situation of the Palace of Westminster in general, and in particular their problems with the electrics they already have in place.

This contrasts strongly with tory attitudes to austerity - ""you'll have to ask your family for help"" is great if your family is loaded, just as ""you'll have to get a second job"" is fine if the national newspapers will pay you ¬£1000+ to jot out a column on a Sunday afternoon.

For those in genuine hardship, such solutions are simplistic - you might not be able to take a second job because there's no bus running to your little village at night. They don't account for those whose hardship is caused by the necessity of looking after a family member, whose debilitating condition prevents them from working themselves. 

Frankly this seems like nothing more than an attack on Mhairi Black's politics - if you're living in a ¬£1M+ mansion owned by your aristocrat father-in-law, whilst paying your wife ¬£15,000 a year out of the public purse for a fake job she doesn't even perform, [[PDF](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmstnprv/476/476.pdf)] then it's a bit of a kindness to describe you as ""out of touch"" when you claim that benefits recipients should be able to live on ¬£53 a week.

Do you understand why ""out of touch"" is a bit of a kindness? Because the alternative is that these people are a bunch of steaming cunts.

I notice that the tories of this subreddit like that suggestion even less - ""it's just our opinions,"" they cry! ""Our political views are just as good as those of all the lefties in here.""

So knocking tories for being ""out of touch"" is being polite - when someone's standing up for the disabled, or advocating support for those who are genuinely seeking work, the question doesn't even arise in the first place.

With the homeless example, I've been working with homeless people in my own city for a good few years. The ones that have problems with drugs will take *anything* they can get, its usually te result of trying to self-medicate whatever thoughts they have in their head. Synthetic cannabis is roughly the same price but even if it isn't on open sale anymore (shops were raided in my city) there is plenty of it about and you can get it online. Some people I've known over the years who would sell it sometimes mix it in with real grass, and pass it off as real grass. Their customers would see well past that but probably not give a fuck. Very different type of drug user. 

When I tried the synthetic stuff it knocked me back a bit on how intense it was, although it doesn't last very long. I could see why someone would take it, if they're willing to take anything that will mess them up. It felt like real weed for 15 minutes... but at the same time it doesn't. Hard to explain that one.

After finishing the challenge, each player gets to challenge other players. Funny thing is Shoot for Love started off their campaign small by inviting domestic club (K-League) Korean players. However, as it went on, the scale got dramatically bigger due to players challenging more famous players. Big players such as Ki Sung-Yeung from Swansea City, Son Heung-Min from Bayer 04, Lee Chung Yong from Crystal Palace, and Ji So Yun from Chelsea Ladies started to take part of the campaign. Then BOOM, Carles Puyol accepted the invitation and later challenged Cesar Azpilicueta to join the campaign. As seen on the video, Dave did his challenge and now invited Juan Mata, Eden Hazard, Oriol Romeu, and Raul Gonzalez. If you can translate the comment section of the video, the producer of this campaign is getting half-worried due to its unexpected growth. And since the producer team has to meet Mata, Hazard, Romeu, and Raul, he is just worried whether they can handle the growing scale.

The fact that someone later TMs an unregistered mark you already use does not provide you with a total defence, but maybe a partial one on the basis of prior reputation and use. 

If the US company applied for their TM to specifically target you there may be an argument the application was made in bad faith and so invalid, however, if they were merely trying to protect their market that may not work. 

With the greatest of respect trademark law and registerability is very subtle and you are not in a position to personally assess the validity of their mark.

Also watch out for the U.S. company trying to cease you domain from Nominet or something similar.

In terms of how to bring it up, it's probably best if you just blurt it out and get it off your chest, the same as you would for any physical health problem. 
The sooner you come out with it the longer the GP has to talk to you about it. 

It might help if you ask for one you've seen before if you liked them, as this might help you talk about it.

Write stuff down - loads of people panic and have their mind go blank - if you write things down, (i.e. symptoms, and what you want to talk about), then you can jog your memory, or even hand the GP the list if you're too shy!

In terms of treatment there are medications that can be used short term, medications to help with mood and to help with poor sleep.

Generally medications are useful for more short term problems - something that might be very useful for you is to be referred to mental health services for talking therapies such as CBT to help you long term.
