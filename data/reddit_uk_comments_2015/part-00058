Thats before we deal with any ongoing plot threads involving the Doctor or companions. 

There's just not time to portray the Daleks or Cybermen as little more than standard obstacles  they just don't have any character anymore as they don't have the proper time to plan scheme and double cross like they used too when you had several multi-part serials. To really make them effective villains they need more time two or three part episodes or a ongoing story arc to really build it up instead of appearing (or appearing to the Doctor at least) late in the story and then having to be quickly dealt with.

Imagine a straight line from left to right. Now imagine pinching one point of the line and pulling it to the left, so that it overlaps the previous section of the line. This is what the angels are doing when they send you back in time. And when they feed off your remaining time energy, they're essentially compressing the overlap and making it flat again, so that now it looks like one continuous line, only shorter than it was before. Which it is, once they ""eat"" the overlap.

The reason the Doctor can't save Ames and Rors is because pulling them out of that shortened timeline would create a massive gap in time (where the overlap would have been had the angels not eaten it), and that would cause time to collapse on itself.

As I recall they have to due to some quirks in the law and with DW's past.  Simply BBC has rights to the Dalek concept, but don't actually own it outright. If the BBC does not continue to use the Daleks, even if it's just one episode a season, some rights revert back to Terry Nation's estate (where Terry Nations estate gets veto rights for further use). So Doctor Who continues to use Daleks in order to ensure they never lose them. ( Some more discussion on the [Terry Nation rights matter](http://www.kboards.com/index.php?topic=156324.0) )

It's a similar situation at Sony. They've been pumping out Spiderman movies because they don't want to risk the rights reverting back to Marvel. They will continue to put out movies, even if they tank, just to keep the rights so they can one day maybe make money off of them.

A similar thing happened with the rights to Fantastic Four in the 90's. Culminating in [a movie that never saw the light of day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fantastic_Four_%28unreleased_film%29) and was made for the sole purpose of not letting the rights get back to Marvel.

What made the Angels originally fascinating, unique, and terrifying were traits like 
a) they move only when nothing's looking at them, including each other, 
b) they move so fast you can't see them, 
c) they pick you up and drop you back in time where you live out your life until you die and feed off your potential energy in the future.

Instead, the second time we saw them, we got Angels that talked, Angels that moved visible to the human eye and did so very slowly, Angels that took nobody back to the future and instead snapped necks.  ~~Angels that we couldn't explain why they hadn't just left the damn cave when no one and nothing was watching them to make them quantum locked.~~ (Apparently there's an explanation for that but I don't find it particularly valid, they get their power from peoples' potential energy and they hadn't zapped the ship anywhere, nor did the passengers/crew die when they 'crashed'/arrived.)

null,false,KrimsonM,null,null,null,"STV is **strictly** a system of **ranked voting** in **multi-seat constituencies**.

The **ranked voting** part refers to how the ballot is filled out (i.e. individuals **rank** the candidates in **order of preference**).

There has to be **at least 2 seats per constituency** for it to be classified as STV,  the equivalent to STV in **single seat constituencies** is **AV**.

STV can **only** be used in a **specific constituency** (not nationwide/regional). A constituency is defined as a **voting district**, so there could be a **single voting district** covering the whole country (which would be the same as nationwide) or **multiple voting districts** each covering a subdivision (the subdivision could be regional, county etc...). **But it has to be used in a constituency**, per the definition.

It is an **approximation** to proportional representation **within a voting district**, it is not meant to achieve full national proportionality. Yes, voting for a candidate that loses is a wasted vote, but under STV the **maximum percentage** of wasted votes is **1/(n+1)** (n = number of seats in constituency) and there can be **no fair system** which provides a **lower maximum** for **any given number of seats per constituency**.

The **ideal number** of seats per constituency is 7, so say we have 490 MPs from 70 7-member constituencies. An **individual** would need to get **12.5%** of the vote in a **single constituency** to get a seat (which is just under **0.18%** of the national vote). A **party** would need to get between **0.18%** and **12.5%** of the national vote to get a seat (depending on how concentrated their votes are)

So to be frank, if a party was **unable to get a seat**, they **did not have a significant percentage** of the vote, significant being defined as **12.5% in any constituency** in the scenario above. To be fair, this is **not a high threshold**, considering this would be roughly 54,000 voters in a 430,000 person constituency (assuming a turnout of 30m voters, the same as the last general election) and they would only have to achieve this in 1 out of 70 constituencies. **A party making up a significant percentage of the vote would get a seat, provided they actually get a significant percentage of the vote**.

The reason the Doctor can't save Amy and Rory is because Amy said goodbye, and the book, written by her daughter confirmed that fact with the final chapter title.  Now, the Time Lords were able to reverse paradoxes like this, as even the Master was able to by cannibalizing the TARDIS during the Tenth Doctor's run, but this time, the goodbye needed to be said.  The Doctor knew that by the Ponds hiding in time and living out a normal happy life, he would be happy.  He already tried to give them a little home and a cool car and we found out in ""Amy's Choice"" that the life they wanted was a ""nightmare"" for the Doctor, so instead of watching it, he chose to move on with tremendous sadness.

People seem to care so much about benefit thieves, but not very much about people who have severe mental/physical disabilities who should be on benefits but aren't either due to the idiotic forms you have to fill in (source: I am taking a year off because my antidepressants stopped working and the stress of uni was killing me, needed my mother, a civil servant working close to this area, to fill in the majority of the form for me) or because of a lack of permanent address to send the money to (afaik).

Perhaps, but you are missing the bigger picture...

&gt;You would think that the BBC could go to them and say...

I believe the general consensus is that they are rather hostile towards working with the BBC in the first place (and anyone appropriating the Dalek concept). And that the BBC's attitude is it owns the concept, not Terry Nation or his estate.

Terry Nation's estate (Terry Nation died in 1997) sued BBC as late as 2008 to try and get rights pulled back on the book side, claiming issues with the BBC improperly claiming ownership. 

In 2004 Russel T Davies [publicly stated](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jul/02/broadcasting.bbc) the BBC could not give ""give the level of editorial influence that the Terry Nation estate wanted to have"" in order to bring the Daleks to the new series.  It was a last minute agreement that brought the Daleks in. (And presumably that agreement is why they have to use them every year.)

The problem is that there is no good relationship on this matter. You have two sides that both claim they own the concept exclusively. They don't *want* to compromise. They want the other side to give up and walk away.

In the end the BBC knows that fans are more likely to sit through a yearly Dalek episode. Maybe they complain, but until the show is run into the ground and no longer profitable the BBC won't. That is also why they won't let the rights lapse. They don't want the nightmare of having to renegotiate with the Terrry Nation estate if fans start *complaining* about their being no Dalek episodes. Likewise they can't afford to simply buy the concept outright (assuming the Terry Nation estate would want to sell)",null,0,null,1423856130,null,0,1423856894,0,cokkjb0,null,t3_2vrxyr,null,t1_cokkjb0,null,t1_cokjfxr,null,null,null,1424571877,null,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3,null

other insurance policy covering the same loss, damage or liability,
your insurer will only pay their share of the claim

So, they're not saying you can't or that it will invalidate your policy, just that they'll only pay their share.

If you then need to claim (where there's a shared liability), both companies are going to suggest that the other is fully liable and politely show you the door. You can lawyer up and have a court decide which insurer is liable and for what percentage, but that's going to take both time (years of letters going backwards and forwards) and money.

Starbucks don't avoid tax by buying a million fucking tonnes of coffee on 31 December each year.

Right they do it by listing the royalty and administration costs as costs of sale, and it just so happens these two figures combine drain away that last bit of profit for the UK entity so they have no profits to report to pay tax on. What an amazing coincidence.

Obviously, it's more than coincidence - why do they bother to continue to operate here if they are not making a profit? Of course the answer is they are making a profit, and the ""admin and royalty"" fees are a blatant lie.

null,false,Demokade,null,null,null,"Except with that discarding of seats that are unwinnable means that even for Labour and the Conservatives there is a degree of pooling resources that is possible.

I mean, if you take Oxfordshire, the Conservatives are unlikely to try manning every station in rural Oxfordshire given the huge majorities they have there. What they will however likely do is have every polling station in Oxford West and Abingdon manned from 6am to 10pm, since they actually could well lose there, and need to know who's voted, and how many they need to try and get out and vote. And you can be damn sure the local group in Oxford West won't be doing it alone.

Hell, if you have each station being manned by 1 person at a time, and say, someone doing it for about at a stretch 3 hours, you could easily do a semi-urban seat with 30-40 polling stations with a couple hundred people. And the 3 hours is probably fairly excessive, given especially vested people like Councillors are likely to spend polling day doing not much else, you probably could do it with not much above 100 people without too many issues.

Following that logic, and being conservative about time volunteered to do it, 400 people could easily do all the polling stations the Conservatives actually need information on in Oxfordshire.

For the smaller parties, especially the LibDems, this is even more doable, with 10-20% of the seats, but not much less than half the members of the Conservatives. If anything, the SNP are actually weaker than almost everyone else in this regard simply because of the concentration of the seats they are going to have to man.

If there was more honesty and less spin, as well as teaching people that things aren't black &amp; white and that politicians can't necessarily do what they say they will because there are things beyond their control, then maybe we'd be better informed because they'd be able to give us all summaries of where each party stands and what they plan to do, but it rests on their honesty, which doesn't happen.

I then went to the conservatives to see what they think of the NHS. It took a while because they're not open about it. I found a pdf that outlines their plans for the NHS and they say it's to prevent the damage done by the labour party and *their* attempts to damage the NHS. They both say the same thing about each other, but with some different wording. Labour implies the conservatives are out to make money. The conservatives say labour's mismanaging it because they're adopting a top down approach. Basically, they both blame each other for the problem, and both claim they have the answer. WTF? How am I supposed to work out who's telling the truth.

When state pensions were introduced most people died before state pension age, and those who survived weren't in any shape to continue working. Also a much greater portion of jobs involved heavy manual labour. 

Today most people live well beyond state pension age in good health, and far fewer jobs require heavy labour. The pension system was not designed with this possibility in mind and making it work under these conditions is fabulously expensive. 

Since the state pension scheme is unfunded, this cost will be borne by younger generations, not those benefitting from the pensions.

It is still a vote for parties though as they set the lists. You want Labour candidate 2 in? You better accept Labour candidate 1 in that case. No choice, that means MPs have to be loyal to the party to climb the list. Party first, constituents second is the way MPs are when there seat is safe enough and if you're top of the lust for a big party like Labour or Tory chances are you're going nowhere, ever. 

You also still have no local MP, right now MSPs on the regional list in Scotland are mostly shit because they don't have to care about constituencies, they are there for their parties and that's it. I'd still favour a system more like that in Scotland with an actual local MP for an area not a group of 7. Regions haven't worked here (except as a party balance) and I doubt they'd work in the UK.

So I'm a Pole with British Citizenship and I will be voting in 2015 General Election and this article made me angry.

Yes, they've thrown some numbers in there but the message behind it is full of shit. Being a Pole and having lived in the UK for the last 13 years I can say that I have met a fair share of Polish immigrants to the country. But still, what I'm about to write is just my opinion.

Let's start at the beginning. To be able to vote, one must be a British Citizen. The process is called naturalisation and requires some commitment in the form of £900 in fees, good enough knowledge of English language, a chunk of studying for the Life in the UK exam and 5 years of continuous, proven history (payslips, P60, JSA, etc.).

People who are eligible and have applied are already committed and acclimatised in the UK enough to not stand out culturally from our British born colleagues. Yes, there are differences, language being the most obvious but ultimately, we're really not that different. 

The idea that Poles will get together to sway a vote in one direction or another is absurd. The political views amongst Poles are as split as they are amongst our hosts. I know Poles who will vote in this election and while I don't know anyone who will vote UKIP, I know people who will vote Greens, Lib-Dems, Labour and Tories. The split is fairly even. Why would people who already have British passport worry about one party's stance on immigration enough to sway a vote. To be fair, I care more about weed getting legalised than what the government is planning in regards to immigration.

Also, most Poles don't want to turn Britain into Poland. We came here to look for a better life, not to bring our shitty one with us. Yes, Poles will hang out together, buy some groceries in one of 1000's of Polish shops (some things are honestly better though), but at the end of the day, we have integrated somewhat well (I can think of few other communities that have integrated as well, and plenty that haven't). I know that I have and so have most of the people I know.

Equally, we're not all perfect either. Same as our British colleagues, we have our share of chavs, rapists, thieves and generally criminals. 

What I'm trying to say is that whoever is eligible to vote already is British and the idea that all the naturalised Poles in the area somehow know each other, get on well with each other, have the same political views, and are going to gang up to sway the vote is fucking bizarre.

I'm going to try to vote for a party with policy that addresses issues that are important to me, as a citizen of Britain, not citizen of Poland. This is my home. I too don't want privatized NHS, IDS running the DWP, tax evasion running rampant and other shit that is going on at the moment. Like I said, we're not that different and anything that affects Brits, affects us as much.

Does this mean that the club has lost faith in 'visual' scouting?

Perhaps, especially as Edwards has always had the reputation of a whizzkid technology obsessed analyst, very much a protege of Damien Comolli, himself the chief worshipper at the altar of Moneyball. Does this mean that we can expect more years of mid price, youthful signings? Possibly.

What do we know of Brendan's faith in more technological scouting? Will he like being overruled by the 'stats men' on the Transfer Committee?

We all have a list of slots we want filled in - a replacement for Gerrard; one, probably two, high-class fullbacks; one, probably two, high-class centre-halfs; a defensive midfielder of renown; a goalkeeper of CL standard for competition; a pacy striker to complement Sturridge. 

We certainly won't get all of these in one window, and I think they will not be names we immediately recognise. I think FSG have very much shown in the last few years the signings they want, and I do not think that Rodgers will demur. Has the club reached some internal tipping point when we will invest in players at their peak?

Some of the best episodes during Davies' reign were written by Moffat. But the problem is, Moffat loves his own ideas a bit too much and thinks himself far too clever. So when restrained he has brilliant episodes like Blink. But then everyone praises him, Blink was amazing! How terrifying the angels are! Well that must be an amazing feeling to have people say that you wrote one of the best episodes of one of the longest running television shows ever, and one of the most terrifyingly creative monsters. Ok, so four angels were scary, lets make it hundreds! oh, and the original mythos and abilities of the angels were scary, lets make them more powerful! Ok, so now these angel episodes didn't get him the praise he got before, but now he is bringing in millions in merchandising and advertising, and leads the show. No one can really edit his ideas down now, so what does he do, makes them bigger, scarier! So what if the Statue of Liberty being and angel makes no sense with the original cannon, Moffat is too busy patting himself on the back for being so clever, and the only ones higher up on the production ladder than Moffat are too pleased by viewership and income that they wouldn't dare challenge him. 

So now, each episode Moffat writes is so full of ideas that none ever get developed or shine. Take the most recent season premiere. A dinosaur in past London, ok, decent plot idea.... Oh, the dinosaur ate the TARDIS, pretty funny, oh, and Jenny and Strax are there. Ok, pretty decent story there to be developed. But wait! There are also mechanical people! Oh, and a vague connection to the Marie Antoinette, which is really cool and we would love to develop this idea, but too busy onto the next point,  for some reason you can't breath around them? I would love to focus on how interesting this could be, but too busy trying to develop the character of the newly regenerated Doctor, his relationship to Clara, bringing back Strax and company. Oh, but hold on a moment, there needs to be  hot air balloon. Also, did I mention yet that this Doctor has an entirely different view on killing? Would love to focus on that, it really is a HUGE issue that should shape the whole season, but I am too distracted with the introduction of a new ""mysterious"" female character who is really just the personification of a mary-sue sexual fantasy. OHHHHHH mystery!

The idea that there are outcroppings of Cybermen here and there means there is always a chance for engagement and the results can be much more entertaining.

with that said, i see us in the transfer market buying a top quality cm, a good gk, a good lb to compete with moreno and cover and a young player (like ruben neves). this is where we need to buy experience and quality. 

players i could realistically and honestly see us acquiring are: 
neto (a name being thrown around a lot) 
cech (another name being thrown about)
nainggolan
pjanic
neves
lacazette
gundogan
axel witsel

those names are based on rumors i've heard, but are the most realistic. who would be a great fit for us? onazi from lazio is one i think we should be looking at. i think lacazette would be a dream transfer for us. and honestly i wouldn't mind, and in fact would love, if we got milner.

While you could perhaps argue that WRT to Dresden, the fact is that Bomber Command routinely few operations purely targeting civilian cities. The idea was to break the will of the German expeditionary forces by hammering their families back home. 

The whole ""it was a civilian target"" is just us looking back with modern sensibilities. No one cared following the Rotterdam Blitz, the gloves came off from all sides. 

&gt; &gt; The United Kingdom had had a policy of only bombing military targets and infrastructure such as ports and railways which were of military importance.[39] While it was acknowledged that bombing of Germany would cause civilian casualties, the British government renounced the deliberate bombing of civilian property outside combat zones (which after the fall of Poland, meant German areas east of the Rhine) as a military tactic. This policy was abandoned on 15 May 1940, one day after the Rotterdam Blitz, when the RAF was directed to attack targets in the Ruhr, including oil plants and other civilian industrial targets which aided the German war effort, such as blast furnaces that at night were self-illuminating. The first RAF raid on the interior of Germany took place on the night of 15/16 May 1940.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam_Blitz#Aftermath

When the Yanks joined in '42 they were initially appalled at the RAFs methods but that mood didn't last long. 

WW2 essentially became the quintessential 20th century example of [Total War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war), where almost all aspects of the state were seen as a part of of the war effort, thus opening the door to direct attacks on the civilians and basic national infrastructure. 

We're lucky the war ended when it did; we were in the final stages of preparation of what would be viewed as[ one of the worst war crimes of the 20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Vegetarian): the deliberate poisoning of German farmland with anthrax to directly kill millions of civilians then starve millions more.

Nope, not at all.

Creating a ""pensioner bond"" with huge returns will act to delay and spread the impact of these changes, particularly preventing those with some money in a pension scheme but not enough to buy a second property from inflating the price of everything other than property (which would result in RPI and CPI shooting up, cue much name-calling and shaming over the dispatch box). As the bond is purchased, the government effectively removes that money from circulation as part of the monetary basis, and instead locks it up in long-term investments, which serve to hold down inflation in the medium term.

You could have a **lower threshold** and **less wasted votes**, by having **more seats per constituency**, the downside is you would either need **larger constituencies** (which would make it less local) **or more MPs** (which would reduce the voting power/accountability of each MP and do we really need/want more than 500 MPs?).

So, it is a **compromise** between how **powerful** and how **local** each MP is, but as you said it is an opinion, but I would point out there have been studies which show having **too low a threshold increases voter disengagement/anxiety**, as there are too many options for people to reasonable pick from and discriminate between.

Your paragraph about party lists confuses me, you are right about **party loyalty** when there are lists, but this can be mitigated pretty well with **open-lists**, see Sweden. In STV you vote for the **candidates** by ranking them in order of preference, there are **no party lists**, **you do not vote for a party**.

Your point about how local an MP is, is a bit misleading considering **most of the time** the boundaries **arbritarily divide** a **single neighbourhood** into **separate constituencies** to get 1 seat per constituency, even though **the residents** would consider these constituencies to be **one area**. An example of this would be that **if we had STV** with 70 7-member constituencies, **Edinburgh** would **(probably)** be a **single 7-member constituency**, which would provide **better local representation** than **arbitrarily dividing** it into **7 single-seat constituencies**.

Scotland **does not have STV**, they have **AMS**, which is **basically first-past-the-post** with a **closed party list to balance the parties**. It is an **improvement** from **FPTP**, but **it is not STV**. These criticisms **only apply** to **party list** systems, such as **AMS** (which is **technically** not a party list system, it is a **hybrid**). 

**STV does not have party lists**, you vote for **individuals not parties**. In STV, the MPs would be **more local** because the **multi-member constituencies** would **not divide** a **single neighbourhood/local area** into multiple sub-divisions, in order to get 1 seat per constituency.

&gt; Do you have recommendations on how to start a personal pension?

The key phrase/word you want to look for is SIPP (self invested personal pension). The wiki has some general advice on funds (and the US one on /r/personalfinance is also good for general advice, although the specific types of accounts aren't relevant), but here's a rough rundown of my view on the key things:

* Cheap place to invest
* Regular investments, for the long term
* Cheap tracker funds (these are hugely broad things that have low costs)

The first bit takes a little bit of research, but there are two main costs involved:

1. Percentage fees
2. Fixed costs

Some places charge a simple fixed cost, which is really expensive with only small pensions but very cheap with large pensions. Some charge percentage fees which is the exact opposite. Searching for ""cheapest sipp"" should give you some good comparisons. You can move your pension, but some places charge a fee for doings so (fees, fees everywhere!) so you can open a percentage based one and then move it later. 

I think iweb and charles stanley direct are cheapish.

For funds, personally I use the Vanguard Lifestrategy funds, they're a simple way of investing in a mix of bonds and equities and have fairly low fees. You can get lower, but you need to do some more research and understand how to work and rebalance things. They're a reasonable goto thing you can look at beating with more custom approaches (fees of ~0.24% per year + platform fees [like iweb or charles stanley directs fees]). Your approach/philosophy/risk level could push you to other things, the recommended reading in the wiki should be relevant here for active/passive investing. 

If I go on I'll just be throwing loads of random thoughts at you (more than already ;) ), but I'm happy to answer any stuff as far as I know.

The final bit to be aware of is this:

It will look quite confusing, it certainly did to me. It's not complicated but there are a lot of phrases and acronyms that are all new if you've not invested before.

Independents don't grow in size but the minute you hit 30 you have an unmanageable voting system. People will not number that far increasing wasted votes above your worst case as I assumes full use of preferences which will not happen. There's also the issue of how a local party gets to order, too few first preferences for a candidate and they're out even if a leading candidates votes would have transferred. I've seen student elections run on STV pose this problem but never on such moving candidate. Lists and never without the majority of voters being factionalised so organisable. 

The Scottish system is an improvement of FPTP and my point isn't that STV isn't better than FPTP it's that it is as flawed as any supposed fair system of election (no one can say FPTP is fair). I prefer the Scottish system, the regional MSPs here are too distant from constituents and I don't see that changing especially with the only options being War and Peace length ballots or party lists.

In my 3rd year, the new tuition fees were introduced and the dip in the economy had just hit so a LOT more of the new kids and my mates and I started pre-drinking from home until about midnight before going out to the clubs. We had about 6 or 7 pubs/bars close down in a period of a year because no-one could afford going out any more. 

It was apparent in my year as SU president as well, the nightlife in my old uni town has just gone to shit because the students can't afford it. They just drink Tesco's own brand vodka at home before going out at midnight.

I really wish Rodger's would use him better, however football isn't just about the present and future when it comes to players, you don't treat players in the regard as being happy they're injured and not able to play just because you don't like watching them play - especially when they've put their heart and soul into the club for decades, done fantastic things for the city of Liverpool and the charities around it.

When it does come to this season, he's actually been brilliant when rested. He's played some blinders and statistics will show you that, even if you just open your eyes and watch the games, I remember this bandwagon of Gerrard hate and then watching him sprinting back and putting tackles in, doing everything a solid midfielder does. It makes me laugh, people are blind when they have an agenda. That's what you have, an agenda.

He doesn't play well when he's overused and not rested.

However that doesn't at all mean you should be happy he's not able to play, or happy that his final season at this club is plagued with an injury.

Enrique is completely out of it, he hasn't played for so long so his form is nonexistent at this point, he will need a lot of games to get fully match fit and that's simply a luxury that we can't afford right now. 

I would actually offload him in the summer considering that he will be 30 next season and his injury record for the past 2 years has been abysmal. We need fullbacks that we can count on. Same goes for Glen as well, missed most of this season and often gets injured each year.

Do some searching online for practice hazard perception tests - there is at least one website that tells you exactly when you clicked and when you *should have clicked* on seeing the hazard and why. You should do well in it.

The other thing is - in the words of Douglas Adams - don't panic. I went from a 40 to a 30 zone and realised it just a bit late. I looked at the speedo (damn digital readout so the examiner could see it plain as day) and it showed 32. I slowed down to 28ish but I thought I'd fail the test. The examiner later told me I was actually at 34 when I entered the zone, but when I realised my speed I slowed down gradually without sudden braking (which is a hazard to cars around you) so he marked it as a minor not a major.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Is there anything that Spurs TV has done in the past that you want to see more of/a different variation of?

Walkers WindUps was great, and should be brought back.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; What current bits from the channel do you most enjoy?

I really like the contests that have been arranged between the players. The penalty shootout with the Kyles and Holtby/Freund, the Ball in a Bag challenge, and so on.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Which players at the club do you think have the best personalities? Who do you want to see more of?

I don't really have an opinion on this, but it seems the players are the most comfortable whenever they do things in groups and don't have to ""carry the whole thing by themselves"".

&amp;nbsp;
 
&gt; Is there anything you've seen on other clubs' channels that you'd like to see Spurs TV do/put a variation on?

It's been said here already, but you should check out City TV on YouTube. They do a lot of quite interesting ""shows"". I like how they give you a view into the daily life at the club with Inside City, tunnel cams, and so on.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Are there any specific players' skills that you want to see showcased/tested?

Standard answer here; Walker/Rose/Dier/Townsend/Yedlin 100m race. And if any of the players are up for it, have them compete in other things as well. Go karts, pool, darts, ping pong, synchronized diving, whatever. Anything they're up for.

The thing about buying players from Wolfsburg is that they have loads of cash, so they do not need to sell at all. Just look at how much they spent on Kevin De Bruyne and Shurrle almost 50m just for 2 players. Especially for a talent such as Knoche. Would be awesome if we could get either of them, but i doubt we will be going for them. Also it is most likely that Wolfsburg will be in champions league next season. 

Leno is one of the biggest GK talent in Germany, would be worth the money to spend it on him. But i do not think we will spend a lot this summer. 30-40m + sales. So maximum around 60m if we can get some serious cash from sales. 

We could potentially get 4m for Lambert, 8-10m for Borini, 5m for Assaidi, Alberto/Teixera 5m (one of them will be sold if not both for around 5m), Jose Enrique 3-5m, Coates 3m and Iago Aspas 5m. Which equals potentially getting 20-30m+ for selling those players that we could use on new players and freeing up huge salaries as well.

Seriously, trust me, I'm in exactly the same position as you. I'm a student who needs money, I work for dominos delivering pizza, and I get paid to ride (and I'm not exaggerating when I say this) quite literally the worst bike in the world. Find a place that supplies their own bikes if you're willing to spend your weekends and nights cold and wet delivering pizza.

However, the job does have its perks. It's a pretty good wage for fast food work, and since you spend most of your time miles away from managerial supervision you can frequently slack off without repercussions. Right now as I'm writing this I'm standing next to the work bike, smoking a cigarette and just relaxing.

I think the major difference is that in football, their are a lot fewer 'employees' per customer than in other industries, meaning the labor cost is really concentrated on a few individuals. For most businesses with revenue the size of a major football team, there are many thousands of employees to compensate. In football, there are a lot fewer people to pay, especially at the top.

- I enjoy him as an actor, been seeing the guy in stuff for years.

- He was the first to bring back a show I'd watched through reruns throughout my entire childhood, so I was biased just because it was back. Rowan Atkinson could have played The Doctor (again) and I would have loved him.

- He had this ability to flip from bubbly goof to serious as hell intimidator (Tennant could do the flip just as good if not better, but his stature and demeanour was always so manic/erratic that it rubbed me and my wife the wrong way for his entire run).

- His relationship with Rose was so friendly and platonic for the most part that it was endearing.

- Finally, his regeneration was so swift and humble that I almost cry every time. He didn't like it, but he accepted it, and he knew it wasn't the end so it wasn't all bad.

Eccleston will always have a place in my heart, and he was my favourite by an inch over Smith. But damn if Capaldi isn't crawling his way into first place now. He just needs better scripts/writing to push him over the top for me.

(Side note; I think it would be awesome if Eccleston came back as a one time villain. He doesn't want to replay roles? Cool, it's not the same role.

I thought one episode was cringeworthy-bad (Glam something-or-other), but the opener and closer were particularly strong. You have to use your imagination more than w/ the TV series, but they're fun to listen to while doing chores, or driving, etc. 

The episodes run about an hour long, and (at least in the download version) include some fun behind-the-scenes interviews w/ cast and crew. 

Individual episodes are on sale for $2.99 (US) as part of this deal, so it's not a big investment to check out one or two and see what you think. There's a subscription option to purchase entire seasons as a package, but for some reason, they haven't adjusted those to reflect the sale price. Seasons are listed as $55, but 8-10 episode series are $2.99 an ep for the sale. Go fig. 

I grabbed seasons 2 &amp; 3 today - hopefully they'll be as good!

You have to give at least a month's notice and you're on a ruling monthly contract, so if your rent's due on the 12th February then you have to give notice **before** the 12th Feb if you want the tenancy to end on the 12th March... otherwise your contact role over for another month, and any notice you give officially starts from the end of *that* month.

By your own admission you missed the deadline, so I suspect they're entirely within their rights to extend the contract by another month and consider your notice period to start from the 12th March.

Honestly it just sounds like you misunderstood their position... or perhaps that the guy at the agency didn't explain it very well.

You have to give *at least* a month's notice, but there's no law (or, I suspect, reasonable contractual stipulation) requiring you to give *exactly* one month's notice and no more.

TL;DR: If you wanted to leave on the 12th March you should have told them by the 12th February, but nothing requires you to tell them *only* on the 12th February and not before.

Did you ever consider a diesel car as opposed to a petrol car! Congratulations, you are a tax avoider.


Only one of those examples is something where the actual decision is taken intentionally to avoid tax, this is really crap substance. Nobody buys a cake over biscuits to avoid tax, no need to use such rubbish examples - it makes your argument weaker.

&gt;This why the whole debate about avoidance is stupid. Government sets the rules, we just live by them. 

Yes exactly! We all hire a bank and specifically ask it to engage the best possible tax avoidance schemes for us, we all set up shell companies in other countries to avoid tax.

Why stop growing now when we know we can? It's settling for mediocrity. No more advancement in healthcare, no more scientific findings and no increasing quality of life.

Party ""X"" have all the facts, figures and statistics to show that centralising specialist heart care is going to bring about both savings to the taxpayer, and a better quality of care.  
They can shed 100 jobs from the public payroll, saving £3m/yr and saving an extra 50 lives per year.  
Party ""Z"" don't buy this research about centralisation saving money and providing better care. They have all the facts, figures and statistics to show that centralising cardiac specialists will cause a loss of 200 jobs, but save only £1m/yr, and will actually *cost* us the lives of around 70 people a year.  
Who lied?  
Probably both. They both have their favoured think tanks. One side is employing think tanks who do not factor in the cost of transporting patients to centres further away from their residence, or the job losses from local businesses who now have fewer hospital staff to sell sandwiches and newspapers to.  
The other side is failing to recognise any benefit from concentrating specialists together from the exchange of knowledge, or cost savings from shared equipment.

Lambert I think will leave to actually play probably going to a lower side.  Could see West Brom coming for him at 5-7 mil.

Balotelli.  I think he goes.  Napoli for around 10-15 mil.  

Ings: we sign him for around 7-10 mil.  

This leaves LFC with Sturridge, Origi, Ings and Borini.  

Gerrard leaves.  Milner comes in on a free.  I say LFC go for Cabaye, he wants out of PSG, he can provide goals and assists from the midfield.  Keep Luis Alberto and see what he can do.  Loan Ibe out to a Prem team.  

I don't think LFC need a defensive midfielder.  Lucas, Can and Rossiter can certainly fill the role.  

Defensive wise, I'd resign Kolo.  Loan out Wisdom again, preferably back to West Brom under Pulis.  Bring in Illori.  I've not seen a lot of his games but the highlights show him as a ball playing CB.  They need to sign another defensive wingback that can play both sides.  Johnson, obviously, goes.  Resign Flanno.  

Sign a back up or competitive GK.  

This team really doesn't need a lot.  A few key pieces and some investment in the academy and players out on loan would be a good idea.

It was a shitbox at 6 months old and they went through them like disposable items. 

Later on, he worked for a small independent instead and used his own CBR 125. His insurance was INSANE, all the short trips caused his bike to drink oil (never fully warm engine) and the job was made miserable by constantly worrying about it being stolen. 

No one ever managed to steal it, but he ended up with a few screwdrivers stuck in his ignition, requiring new barrels. Always just idiotic kids who think they know how to rob a bike... 

In the end he bought a 50cc ped for deliveries and he could insure both for less than the CBR on business use. It was tidy when he got it but he actually purposefully made it look rough and it seemed to work. No one tried to steal it. 

He said working for a big chain was easier, more deliveries and less accountability but he preferred the small independent for reasons stated above, he didn't have to wear the 'dank, scummy body condom'

That said, I have had a few good discussions here. In all honesty though they're hard to come by.

I find too often that many of the users here are insecure about their reasons for supporting City, or their length of time as a supporter, and will as such take the mindless 'happy clapper' approach to any discussion City related in order to validate themselves as a City fan. Which often means that critical or negative topics in relation to City just become a vehicle for these users to prove their supporter credentials by clapping like a seal and expressing faux outrage at anything that isn't sugary sweet positivity.

Just letting it all hang out and discussing things frankly or with some humour is difficult in such an atmosphere.

I still pop on now and then, but this sub is still lacking in interesting debates or discussions, or even just a real community feel.

Not an excuse for Russia to **Invade and conquer parts of a country**.

&gt;essentially forcing countries to choose between it and existing relations with Russia.

Hahaha... no. At no point did the EU say ""Ukraine, either tell russia to fuck off or we tell you to fuck off"". Russia wanted Ukraine to join it's economic union and failed to provide any major incentives for doing so. When the government initially sided with Russia, Euromaidan happened because they realised it was a shitty deal. As soon as it became obvious that Russia wouldn't get what it wanted via diplomacy, it decided to do it via force.

Russia is trying to force reunification upon the former territories of the USSR through a combination of propping up puppet dictators and attacking countries that try to turn away. Belarus, Transnisteria, Georgia and now Ukraine are all becoming victims of their expansionist aims.

&gt;I were Putin I would fail to see any logical reason to consider the demands of countries who are prepared to work against Russia.

This is why the only option we are left with is use of force, either indirectly or directly.

&gt;The notes of the meeting say: ""Bloomfield advised that he has never paid a bill and never received a bill and when he needed money it was sent to him.""

&gt;""When pressed, Bloomfield confirmed that his living expenses are paid from wherever there is money. In his words there is a box somewhere which contains money and he arranges for the bills to be paid.""

&gt;Mr Bloomfield claimed an offshore company paid his rent and that another company paid for ""the use of a Boeing 757, the use of a boat and a helicopter"".

Since the BBC hadn't managed to track down Bloomfield *(and even if they had it's unlikely he'd offer up the notes of a meeting with an inspector of taxes)* it would appear that someone in HMRC leaked parts of the investigation file.

No doubt HMRC's senior management will pursue the source of the leak with greater vigour than they did Bloomfield and his ilk.

&gt;The documents show the taxman also missed a straightforward opportunity to prove Mr Bloomfield's dishonesty.

&gt;At one of the meetings, he told HMRC that ""he had never had an account in an offshore bank"". But the leaked HSBC files show Mr Bloomfield had an account at HSBC's Private Bank in Geneva in 1993.

&gt;The taxman already had the HSBC files at the time of Mr Bloomfield's interview - so it should have been easy to show that he was lying.

This obscures the issue of whether the investigator was provided with the details of the HSBC bank accounts.

Even if they knew he was lying, HMRC doesn't have the resources to prosecute all the cases they could.  

About ten years ago Lord Grabiner instructed that the Inland revenue should be prosecuting large numbers of benefit fraud cases.  These sort of cases are comparatively simple and they excite the rabble.  Prosecuting a complex failure to notify case where the accused party can afford the very best legal representation is something there's probably little appetite for.",null,0,null,1423886551,null,0,false,0,cokzn9l,null,t3_2vshfv,null,t1_cokzn9l,null,t3_2vshfv,null,null,null,1424579081,null,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4,null

null,false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,null,"&gt;Why are the authorities here deliberately and consciously ignoring stuff like this?

The IRS model might be accurately summarised as akin to, ""If we investigate you and we find you didn't pay your taxes we will find a **very** heavy book and throw it at you hard.  And after that, we'll take all your money!""

It's important to bear in mind that the UK is in many respects a tax haven.  Since the seventies we've been all about being friendly to foreign money and light-touch regulation.

At the same time HMRC *(and before that the Inland Revenue and HM Customs &amp; Excise)* isn't resourced to fight the biggest and most complex cases.  They're outclassed in terms of both manpower and capability.

The people in the top public sector jobs won't win any brownie points for turning up at the Public Accounts Committee and announcing, ""You've under-resourced us.  We can't do what you ask and it's your own fault!"" so instead they spend all their time engineering success stories.  This is why you see things like the head of HMRC announcing they collected more tax, when tax collected actually fell and reduced the tax gap when it actually increased.

*(It's also why you see things like the catastrophic failure of Rotherham council where things are swept under the carpet.)*

In all these things the root issue is a failure at the political level.  If the politicians funded things properly and removed senior managers who spent their time generating success stories, rather than actually doing the job things would change.

Of course, in a week that a Lord accused of tax avoidance says everyone does it and when the mud sticks to everyone, it's not hard to see where the lack of political will comes from.",null,0,null,1423887785,null,0,false,0,col0518,null,t3_2vshfv,null,t1_col0518,null,t1_cokohvk,null,null,null,1424579312,null,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11,null

I have to disagree. Germany's industrial military production peaked during the peak of them being bombed. 

WWII has thought us that targeting civilians not only does not work in breaking a nation's will to fight, but it also also means fewer bombing runs on military targets. And military targets are the ones that actually make war. Thus we've learned not only is targeting civilians unethical, it is also impractical.

And then NATO completely forgot that lesson while bombing what was then still left of Yugoslavia.

New York was already very damaged from all the time-related events of the episode.  So when Rory was zapped back in time after they all saw the tombstone, that was it.  No using time travel to change anything.

For the common argument that the Doctor could have saved them and made a fake tombstone as the cover story, that also would not work.  Let's say it was all fabricated. Then we'd have something like:

The Doctor finds the tombstone in 2012, so he goes back in time to rescue his friends and set up a fake tombstone to be found by his past self in 2012, prompting him to go back in time ... etc.

""The episode was meant to be a deep philosophical reflection on death, killing Oswin was vitally thematic!"" you might say. Bah. At least take a 102-level philosophy course before spouting that nonsense. There wasn't any very impressive thinking on the subject of death involved in the writing of that episode, and that shows clearly in the fact that they picked a character as ill-fit for the role of ""dying person"" as Oswin and then killed her in a way which made zero sense from a plot structure standpoint. I'd be happy if the next series started by retconning that whole episode. An area 51 episode would be nice too. But that's a story for another day.

**EDIT** - hang on this could be really cool. An episode starts with the Doctor and Clara discussing UFO sightings and such; the Doctor, of course, recalling all the random ones that were real and involved him, and callously shooting many of them down as obvious hoaxes. Clara asks him about the Roswell incident and area 51. He says area 51 is just a top-secret cryptographical research center or something, but he's always wondered about the Roswell incident and never really got around to checking it out. They head there with the TARDIS and start investigating, and are soon arrested, with the Doctor's TARDIS taken to area 51. Jack Harkness gets involved or something, was UNIT around back then? Idk.

Anyway I coach U10 rec. Something I do towards the beginning of each season, after we've gotten just a couple of games behind us is to take my team to a college-level match. There's a smaller university about an hour away that I like for this. The drive over gives them a chance to get to know each other better. 

Once there, they're given jobs as ball boys. This way not only are they taking part but they're forced to pay attention to what's happening on the pitch. I'm always surprised at just how little experience these kids have had with soccer outside their own games. On the drive back we disect the game: talk about what impressed us, how lousy the ref was... Later on in practice I'll use some of those things as examples or talking points. 

Anyway I've done this a few years now and it's always been a success. It's instant bonding and there's a marked change in how they behave together before and afterwards. The college team and staff love the attention and my parents have a great time getting acquainted and seeing their kids having fun together. Everybody wins but the best part is that my teams always end up being best of friends. 

You'll get all kinds of good and bad advice from better coaches than me. I just thought that one thing is something that works for me and is worth sharing.

Borini is enthusiastic and energetic but just doesn't have the ability to be a good striker for us. He needs to move away to save his career, as Danny Ings (£5m) would play over him every day of the week if we got the Burnley striker. 

Hopefully Rodgers' scouting mission in Rome ends in strong interest on our end and maybe a deal for Miralem Pjanic for £25m, who'd be a fantastic replacement for Stevie. I hope we see Can as a DM rather than a box to box midfielder, as I think Pjanic would be a better CM for us. 

If Migs keeps improving as he has done after coming back I'd say we only need good competition rather than a full replacement - Mat Ryan, who really impressed at the Asia Cup. He's won the Belgian League GK of the Year twice in a row (previously won by Migs and Thibaut Courtois), as well as the Asian Cup Golden Glove, and I think he can be a very good backup/competition for Migs and someone we can nurture into a top keeper.

Like a lot of Australians and Americans I supported a bunch of other sports while writing Soccer (we have our reasons) off for some ignorant (and some not completely unfounded) reasons.

I had halfheartedly supported Everton because of Tim Cahill and as such I saw highlights and stories about the PL on Fox Sports and I thought it was ridiculous that 4 teams had the top 4 spots to themselves year after year and there was a duopoly on the Premiership.

Around 2011 I became more interested in the sport which had a lot to do with these sky blue motherfuckers challenging, for reasons I didn't know or really care. And what do you know they won the league and I thought fuck yeah! Fuck you United. Fuck you Chelsea. Which might sound like glory hunting but it's actually more about the underdog as far as I'm concerned. Around the same time I became aware of this ridiculous little man in Spain making everyone else around him look silly.

Low crosses, shots close to you, 1v1's...it's all instinct. The most important thing as a keeper is to be able to trust those instincts, to trust that when you go into auto-pilot and when you just do what naturally comes to you at that moment, that you'll make the right decision and it'll work out. If you can't trust in *yourself* making a save, you won't make that save 9 times out of 10.

Sometimes it comes down to technique obviously, but a large amount of what a keeper does is all in his head. Most players don't have the mental strength to be a keeper. You're literally *the last* line of defence. Anyone else fucks up and it can be fixed...you fuck up and it's a goal and that's a massive amount of pressure.

[I think its important to note that london and the west Midlands (aka Birmingham 2nd most populated British city) had the highest teetotallers and increase there.](http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1423825856484/adult-drinking-01.svg)

""There's a growing Muslim population"" to quote Diane abbot which does seem to explain why it was particularly high in those areas.

So its an understandable reason then and doesn't represent the whole younger generation.

------------

There is sentiment in this thread that there's a cultural change in drinking *behaviour/attitude* with younger generation. The change IMO is from there being more things to do as a past time, and not needing to loiter (as I did) and drink outside.

It doesn't mean more teetotal* though, which is the distinction some are confusing.

Drinking is still ok with the majority of young adults, the culture at large doesn't shun drinking. It just shuns binge drinking more. Those pretty, one direction like Youtubers many younger kids follow are not against alcohol at all. If anything they encourage drinking for funny stories. However going out and binging to past time is less common as they have youtubers to follow.

-----------

To reiterate, there's nothing compelling in popular young culture that makes me to think teetotallers are increasing because of it. Teetotal increase is due to Muslim population in london and birmingham. If anything, popular young culture encourages drinking. Drinking as a past time for bored young people is decreasing due to social media communities.",null,0,null,1423906730,null,0,false,0,col5f5t,null,t3_2vrsli,null,t1_col5f5t,null,t1_cokv6g5,null,null,null,1424581776,null,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2,null

null,false,TheAnimus,null,null,null,"&gt; You have zero credibility when you kick off with claiming Amazon pay VAT.
&gt; The customer pays VAT, Amazon merely collects it and passes on to HMRC. Like all vat registered companies they specifically do not pay VAT on anything.

Which is why I specifically stated that they collect the VAT.  Remember the customer also pays for any profit too.  If I buy something at 50, then sell it at 100, which is a standard rate vattable, I'll have collected an extra 10 for the government.

So it strikes me as odd that people choose to separate corporation tax as not being paid by the consumer.  Back when VAT was lowered to 15%, I upped my prices by 2.5%.  The fact is, my customers were happy with the total price, and I didn't need to lower them.

B2B is of course, a different matter.

For most consumers, VAT just like profit margin, is part of the total price.

&gt; their major markets and then spend it on growth - an avenue not open to locally competing businesses

But this is investment, when we are on the receiving end of it, we like it.  In fact one could argue that demonstrates precisely why taxation removes growth.

The problem is what is the fair amount for the brand, for the technology, the infrastructure, logistics expertise.

Also dropping Lovren sooner is something hindsight helps with. At the time dropping your record signing CB is not something you do after a handful of poor games so BR gave him more time to try fight out of his form.

I worked as management scum for a Dominos Pizza store a few years ago and our insurance policy was essentially a supplementary catch-all for the home insurance policy.

Para-phrased:
&gt; Third-party insurance cover for any vehicle (subject to a declaration from the owner/operator that the vehicle is in a roadworthy condition), being operated by an employee of the company, while engaged in authorised company business.

It was a tack-on insurance policy, essentially you drove to work on your own insurance (under the commuting part of your insurance) and once you were clocked on your own insurance was no longer valid and the the companies insurance took over.

You never needed to tell your insurer anything, so your premiums weren't effected.

We didn't have any at my store, but some of our sister stores did and their bikes got pure fucked, pure fast.

1) Although it's definitely one of the most fashionable languages to know, I'm yet to be convinced it's going to stay the distance. Which means OP might find he's invested a lot of time and effort in learning Scala only to find all the jobs have been replaced by a requirement to know something else.

2) The key word in hiring any kind of developer is experience. Knowing a language inside out isn't good enough -- you need to be able to demonstrate real-world usage of it. That means either at an existing job or by pointing to a github account and showing some examples of your contributions to open source projects. And there are far fewer Scala projects looking for contributors than some other languages.

To be honest I'd advise OP to go for one of the old stalwarts such as PHP or Java.

**Price of product:** £5 (but actually free as they were doing a 3 for 2!)

**Where did you purchase:** The Body Shop

**Product claims:** A refreshing instant foaming cleanser for blemished skin. Gently but effectively cleanses skin, Removes make-up and impurities. Regular cleansing will help keep skin blemish-free.

**About you:** Combination skin, moderate acne and very mild rosacea, past eczema. Hormonal acne and general pimples everywhere.

**Your opinion:** It has a pump that foams when you dispense, and there's a lot of foam! I've tried tea tree products in the past and they were far too harsh, but this is far more gentle. It's made a slight difference to my acne, clearing it slightly, but my face is always a bit tight after washing - I can't stand more than a few minutes without running and putting toner/lotion on. It's not dried my skin out hideously compared with other TT products and I've had no redness, which I always had previously. I'd say it's worth a try for acne sufferers as it does seem to be making a difference, but once the bottle is empty I'm going to try and find something a tiny bit less drying as I'm starting to experiment with BHAs.

**Ingredients:**  Copied from website - Aqua (Solvent/Diluent), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (Surfactant), Polysorbate 20 (Emulsifier), Coco-Glucoside (Surfactant), PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil (Emulsifier), Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil (Natural Additive), Glycerin (Humectant), Calophyllum Inophyllum Seed Oil (Skin Conditioning Agent), Myristamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate (Skin-Conditioning Agent), Citric Acid (pH Adjuster), p-Anisic Acid (pH Modifier), PVP (Hair Fixative), Salix Alba Bark Extract (Natural Additive), Sodium Hydroxide (pH Adjuster), Menthol (Cooling Agent), Limonene (Natural Additive), Leptospermum Petersonii Oil (Natural Additive), Tocopherol (Antioxidant).

All is not lost with Lovren and hopefully he will play today in a more stable team and we will start to see the best of him. The formation problem, well Sterling is playing up top now. I'm sure him and Balotelli could have gelled and this would be a good combination allowing Ballo to drop into midfield. I think Borini and Balloteli also might have been worth a shot, but Ballo and Lambert would never work. No pace and no work rate. I also think earlier in the season Marko was off the pace and Lallana was in and out with injury so why not give 2 up top a go with Cout's in the hole. I think a lot of Liverpool fans were shouting for this.

So my alcohol consumption dropped dramatically and I started adopting the cafe culture of the countries in which I lived.

But my social life and confidence  suffered on nights out  (chatting up the local lasses) so I started on the spiriits. Gin and whiskey were lovely. But even after just 2 drinks of an evening, it would literally take me days to recover. So I stopped those, too.

I now will maybe have a lovely ale at Christmas or when all the planets are aligned, but when the liquid enters my system, I can actually feel that it's a poison. So I just have the one.

This is a xenophobic remark for a couple of reasons. Bear in mind that this was in a letter to Ianucci, a Scottish-Italian comedian.

Firstly, why is he bringing up Italy at all? Ianucci was born in Glasgow, to a mother born in Glasgow and a father who came to Scotland in 1950. By making a thinly-veiled attack on Italians out of the blue, he is attacking Ianucci by attacking his heritage as from a country of tax-dodgers. It's not a rational attack - it's a xenophobic one.

The other thing is, reputation for tax-dodging or not, it's also a ridiculous statement because he probably pays more tax than most British people too, £2m is *loads of money*. 

&gt;he simply stated that he probably pays more tax than most Italians.

There are some far more important things governments could do to combat obesity if they were serious. Food labelling would be a start, as would advertising regulations similar to those applied to tobacco or alcohol.

More than 2m people living in social housing could be given the chance to buy their homes under a Conservative party plan to extend discounts offered under the “Right to Buy” programme to housing association properties.

Some social landlords condemned the plan saying it could be difficult to implement.

At present the “Right to Buy” applies only to Britain’s dwindling numbers of council house tenants, with limited access for 2.5m tenants in properties owned by housing associations. These private not-for-profit companies which, in some cases, date back to the 19th century have gradually replaced councils as the main provider of social housing in the UK.

Tenants in these properties are currently offered limited discounts — typically up to £16,000 — and only on properties bought by the association since 1997.

The original Right to Buy scheme, introduced by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, was hugely popular but has been widely blamed for reducing the availability of social housing. It led to more than 1.5m homes being sold at discounted rates.

The coalition has already tried to revive Right to Buy on council houses by extending the discounts for tenants buying their home: to £77,000 in England and up to £102,700 in London.

More than 27,000 homes have been sold under the programme since the coalition came to power in 2010. A series of housing sector figures have cast doubt on the latest Conservative party proposal.

David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said that because they were charities many housing associations were legally barred from selling homes at below market value.

The government would need to introduce legislation to allow housing associations to sell houses to tenants at a discount, according to Piers Williamson, chief executive of the Housing Finance Corporation.

He warned that such government intervention would also risk bringing housing associations’ £60bn of borrowings on to the public balance sheet.

Brendan Sarsfield, leader of the G15 group of London housing associations, said that giving away homes at deep discounts would undermine the sector’s financial viability.

“It would mean giving away assets, many housing associations have large loans, what would the banks do if suddenly our assets were eroded in this way?”

Kate Davies, chief executive of Notting Hill Housing Group, said the proposal “would have to be backed by significant public funds”.

The extension of Right to Buy is being pushed by Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary. He is understood to have support from some senior colleagues including Lynton Crosby, who is in charge of the Tory election campaign.

He backs a proposal from the Centre for Social Justice, a think-tank he set up in opposition, for discounts of up to 30 per cent of a property’s value.

Mr Duncan Smith is also floating an even more radical idea: giving away all social housing to its tenants. This proposal has met resistance from the Treasury.

Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, is pushing a radical proposal to give away all social housing to its tenants

Under this idea, any tenant who has worked for more than a year would be given their home. The association would retain a stake, perhaps 40 per cent, which could be used to pay off any residual debt on the property.

Any surplus beyond this could be put back into building more social housing: although it is unlikely to achieve a “one for one” replacement ratio.

Mr Orr said this was “a genuinely stupid idea”. It was first put forward by Paul Kirby, a former civil servant in the Number 10 Policy Unit, who wrote: “Essentially this is a simple proposal — give away the homes, clear £75bn of debt, relieve tenants of their rents and save billions per year in benefits.”

Critics say this would leave even less social housing for rent.

More than a third of former council homes bought by their tenants in one London borough are now owned by private landlords, according to research.

“Right to Buy is a vote-winner but it is poor social policy, if those homes are sold off or given away what happens to the people currently in temporary accommodation or waiting in the queue for social housing, where are they going to live?” said Mr Sarsfield.",null,0,null,1423915361,null,0,false,0,col6y30,null,t3_2vv74z,null,t1_col6y30,null,t3_2vv74z,null,null,null,1424582557,null,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7,null

What's fascinating is that despite this  evidence right next door many here are still calling for these exact proposals to be used here. 

Hollande has been so disastrous for the French economy he's had to bring in a centre right PM to clean up his mess. This pro business, tax cutting PM has been described by the French left as the most embarrassing thing they've ever had to endure.

&gt; In August 2014, Bank of America agreed to a near-$17 billion deal to settle claims against it relating to the sale of toxic mortgage-linked securities including subprime home loans, in what was believed to be the largest settlement in U.S. corporate history. The bank agreed with the U.S. Justice Department to pay $9.65 billion in fines, and $7 billion in relief to the victims of the faulty loans which included homeowners, borrowers, pension funds and municipalities.[87] Real estate economist Jed Kolko said the settlement is a ""drop in the bucket"" compared to the **$700 billion** in damages done to 11 million homeowners. Since the settlement covered such a substantial portion of the market, he said for most consumers ""you're out of luck.""

100% wrong. From the change in formation (4-2-3-1 from a diamond) to the general tactics, at the beginning of the season we completely abandoned what made us so successful last year. It was slow, plodding, possession for the simple sake of possession.

With a change to the 3-4-3, we finally started to press back up the pitch and play with a little bit of confidence; this has coincided with our solid run of form.

Regardless of what striking options we had from September on, there was no reason to change the formula that almost won us the league.

null,false,JoeSalmonGreen,null,null,null,"The Green Party has reacted to a letter co-signed by Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg which calls for action on climate change. [1]

The letter states that the three leaders will work ""across party lines"" to agree cuts to the UK's carbon emissions. The Green Party leader, Natalie Bennett, has responded by urging voters to judge parties on their 'actions in government and policies on fracking.'

The Green Party remains the only major political party to oppose fracking, airport expansion and the Government's road building programme.

Natalie Bennett, leader of The Green Party, said:

""It is to be celebrated that the Coalition and the Labour Party have acknowledged the vital importance of climate change, and the urgent need to take action.

""No doubt these warm words will be treated with some suspicion by many. In the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems we have three parties who have been in power in recent years and failed to go anywhere near far enough in the fight against runaway climate change.

""Voters will be able, however, to make a judgement as to why it has taken them so long to reach this point, and how it squares with their actions in government and policies on fracking, road building, airport expansion, energy efficiency and renewable energy. The next Government must cut carbon across our economy: that means no new runways in South East England, an end to damaging road building programmes and substantial investment in affordable public transport.

""We will work hard to ensure that this agreement is maintained in letter and in spirit, and that decisions and policies are based on evidence and realism - particularly about the little developed technology of carbon capture and storage.""

If they remove that profit by intra company charging to low tax regime countries then that is avoidance/evasion depending on exactly what they've done. 

The 'charge' against amazon is that the UK part is profitable and they use cross company license fees to reduce that profit to near zero and thus attract no corporation tax.

What the overall business does RE profit is actually besides the point because they could of course spend that money taken out of the country on lots of stuff and reduce their overall profit to zero. But the reason why that is still a problem is because they have made a profit in the UK, but spent the money overseas to reduce the tax bill, not locally. 

Also don't call me a fucking idiot - I actually know what I am talking about, I suspect you do not (since you seem able to swallow the most basic of excuses put forward by these businesses). Overall loss does not mean subsidiaries should not have paid tax. 

Fwiw I love amazon and spend a huge amount with them, I just want them to pay a fair amount of tax.

I was at a Public Health England marketing conference recently, where they outlined their upcoming campaigns. Something that struck me came from an alcohol seminar. The speaker handed out some notes that showed that the biggest cost to the NHS in terms of alcohol related illness came from middle to higher income professionals, who drank very regularly at home, and although did not present damaging behaviours as a result of their alcohol intake certainly suffered health issues as a result. So, these will be the people targeted by the campaign of course? No. They were aiming it low income or unemployed people... and they couldn't give me or any of the other delegates a good reason why this was. This is the kind of tactic the government love. It's socially divisive and paints a picture of the bottom of society being responsible for all of its problems. 

One of the consequences of a state that provides a safety net for its citizens, is that inevitably there will be some outliers who take advantage of the system, and there will be some people whose problems are so severe there is no possibility of fixing them.

null,false,domalino,logo,,null,"He started regularly last year and was part of the teams that blew away arsenal, Spurs twice and United. Again no one was complaining then when he had the most assists to Aguero and Negredo. He's still created more chances than anyone in the team this season according to the clubs own stats in an article about the midfielders on the club website. 

He's been overplayed a bit because of Nasri and Silva's injuries, but he's definitely good enough to be a key part of the squad and a starter based on the opponents. 

His problems stem from the fact we have been slow moving from defence to attack this year, he no longer gets the ball in space to run into, and with players supporting him in counters like we saw last season, and Negredo leaving/Dzeko injured and out of form. Also Zabaleta's poor form/tiredness has really curbed his threat because without Zabaleta making this underlapping runs into the box between LB and CB he is one dimensional, because there's no other option except to cross. 

Last year he provided a ton of goals stretching defences, popping high balls into Negredo or low ones to Aguero across the 6 yard box. Now everyone knows he can only go low to Aguero it's easy to stop. 

I genuinely think the arrival of Bony, return to 4-2-2-2 will benefit him a lot and we'll see last years Navas providing a lot of goals again. 

However he's still been adding stuff to his game. His defensive workrate against Southampton was incredible, helped us win that match and against Chelsea he was probably our most threatening player.  

I don't think Navas is world class, he's not good enough to be a default starter, but he is vital to the squad as everyone who remembers 12/13 should remember what we were like without a real winger, and the squad would be worse and the football more frustrating without him.

Also you are forgetting the SkyGo and OnDemand service they provide, which blows Netflix and Amazon out of the water. Couple that with Sky Movies OnDemand and it seems like a decent service compared the the crap you get on Netflix.

&gt;The lack of brake lights

Fog Lights?

&gt;The guy who only slowed down to 50mph thinking 50mph was the visibility now doesn't see you until it's too late and slams into the back of you.

If he's travelling at a speed that won't let him stop in time, in the prevailing conditions, then he's travelling too fast.

&gt;A shitty car with drum brakes will need to travel slower to stop in a given distance than a BMW with ceramic discs all around will.

I don't think there are many cars on the road in the UK today that have drum brakes in all four corners - even my 1990, absolute entry-level Peugeot 205, that I drove as a poor student, had front disks.

The problem here is people generally consider their driving skills to be much greater than they actually are, and when the shit does hit the fan, they are found wanting.  For example, most cars on the road today are fitted with ABS, but I suspect that the vast majority of drivers don't have any understanding of how ABS affects the braking performance of their car and how to use it correctly (it often actually increases stopping distance, but lets you steer around a hazard whilst applying maximum braking force and remaining in control).

Likewise, outside of a single paragraph in the highway code, your average driver in the UK most likely has little idea how to react if their vehicle enters a skid.  Personally, I'd like to see some sort of skid-pan training added to the UK test - I'm not suggesting that everyone needs to be a rally driver, just that they have the opportunity to get a feel for how to handle marginal conditions in a safe environment and not suddenly, at 1am, on a back road.",null,0,null,1423919108,null,0,false,0,col7oli,null,t3_2vv2a8,null,t1_col7oli,null,t1_col78lc,null,null,null,1424582900,null,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23,null

---

&gt;__Direction finding__ (__DF__), or __radio direction finding__ (__RDF__), is the measurement of the direction from which a received signal was transmitted. This can refer to [radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio) or other forms of wireless communication. By combining the direction information from two or more suitably spaced [receivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio\)) (or a single mobile receiver), the source of a transmission may be located in space via [triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation). Radio direction finding is used in the navigation of ships and aircraft, to locate emergency transmitters for [search and rescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue), for tracking wildlife, and to locate illegal or interfering transmitters.

&gt; Further if this scheme was valid why isn't every business doing it?

um.... lots of businesses are doing it. thats why it has been in the news every few months for the past 5 years. you linked to a BBC article describing three that are doing it.

makes no sense

&gt; Services companies shouldn't pay Corp tax anyway they take nothing out of the community and only add to it through employing people and driving down costs for consumers. 

um... what? they take people (who have been educated and use the roads and public transport to get to work, looked after by NHS etc etc) and they take a share of the 'spending' money of the countries companies and people. why *on earth* does not having a physical product mean you somehow don't need to pay corporation tax. that makes even less sense than your first point.

Well no they are not exclusively responsible, but yes they have driven the online retail industry very hard in terms of price and service - thats a good thing but it would not be radically different if they paid a bit more tax.

I've always liked articles that give an insight into how The Boot Room used to operate, and I think they became more relevant when Kenny came back in his second spell as manager. 

Jimmy Case's comments about the lack of detailed tactical instructions, about letting players figure it out themselves - it makes a lot of sense that Kenny tried to do the same. Redknapp was the same, and Ferguson left a lot of the coaching to his staff, instead focusing on the mentality of his squad. That mode is a little outdated now - the game has become much more organised and tactically complex, and there's a much bigger learning curve for players now - natural ""football brains"" are rare. 

Unfortunately, that sort of management puts more onus on bringing in the right players - and we didn't do that in that summer window. From the start, the big-man-small-man template of Carroll and Suarez was doomed to fail because each striker's style of play necessitated the whole team being built around them. Then you had players like Downing and Henderson who didn't have any confidence in their own decision-making - and thus performed better when Rodgers came in and gave them instructions on what to do and how to play. The defensive unit benefited from Steve Clarke's coaching and Lucas being in god-mode, after which it all fell apart. It's no wonder the best performing attacking players for Kenny - Kuyt, Maxi, Bellamy, Gerrard when fit - were all senior players who were already tactically experienced and confident in their ability",null,0,null,1423919939,null,0,false,0,col7vxu,null,t3_2vv1jz,null,t1_col7vxu,null,t3_2vv1jz,null,null,null,1424582996,null,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1,null

You talk about wanting an egalitarian society, yet don't care about achieving low unemployment? Also don't most people like their 0 hour contracts with only a few wanting more hours, and aren't many of them actually full time? Isn't a society with a high number of 0 hour contracts better than a society with a huge number of unemployed?

Except its not short term debt, and the pain of paying it back in the long run will almost undoubtedly be more costly. Nothing wrong with running up debt to invest, lots wrong with running up debt to simply function which is what we are doing now. So when do we finally say, enough debt is enough? When were growing 10% a year, or when the credit markets cost us so much to borrow we go full Greece and the pound collapses. You will see your fabled equality then.

It's clear from Lambert's statement that he wasn't given a remit to win stuff; he was given a remit to slash the wage bill and keep the club in the Prem. It's a recipe for a mid-table cash cow that makes Lerner rich off TV money and nothing else. The writing has been on the wall that Lerner has wanted out for at least three years now. At least.

With that in mind, I don't think Lambert and Bent were ever going to agree. His wages were already high, and I would imagine that, being bought in in the days when Villa was splashing the cash, he would have had bonuses for scoring goals, maybe even for starting/playing at all. If it was Labert's job to save money, it makes sense that he wouldn't play him, or even keep him on the club's wage bill; hence the loaning out to other clubs.

On the the other hand, if Bent had agreed to a pay cut, he could have finished his career playing Premiership football, but I can understand why he wouldn't have wanted to do that. If you've got massive dressing room drama going on, that can affect your performance, or even your desire to do well, which is why I tihnk he went lazy. It's completely understandable that he'd want the money that was signed for, but the consequence is that he's gone from an England striker and a player with a hell of a hayday, to a puttering end to his playing days. And I think that's sad.

null,false,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,null,"I think you may have a rather romanticised view of private healthcare in Germany and Sweden (I've lived in both and have worked under the NHS here). For Germany, the level of privatisation is roughly at the same level it is here currently (about 10% of all insurance is private) and government spending on healthcare in Germany exceeds that in the UK by about 20%. 

So, I would argue, if anything, the healthcare system in Germany is *less* privatised than the NHS *currently* is. If the NHS is privatised further, this difference will only grow. 

Sweden has for a long time resisted healthcare privatisation. With the election of a right-wing government ten years ago, this has changed and the private sector has been allowed in. Nevertheless, the private sector has primarily focussed on wealthy urban areas - areas generating the greatest amount of profit - which has led to accusations of this trend leading to an unequal classist system and, furthermore, of skewing statistics in favour of privatisation (as, due to the selection bias, the only sample population is a generally healthy inexpensive one). I wouldn't be surprised if the new leftist government were to either halt or even reverse privatisation of the healthcare system. 

Furthermore, as with Germany, even in its current state, government funding of healthcare is greater than in the UK and that is, again, with the current levels of privatisation of the NHS. 

I have no experience with the French or Australian systems, but looking solely at statistics, they do not strike me as being significantly more privatised than the UK system. Certainly not to the extent that current proposed NHS privatisation plans suggest. 

The NHS has several problems, I agree, although I do not think they are as significant as we are repeatedly told to believe. It is a good system as it is. There are several roots of the problems it has though: 

* societal expectations are different (I think this is a grossly under-explored factor - people expect perfection where none can be achieved)
* demographics have changed (an increasingly old population is expensive, however, re-evaluating healthcare access based on age is a hugely controversial topic) 
* organisational (the single NHS database has been a fiasco - not because it was a bad idea, but because it was handled as a political issues, rather than an IT issue)
* structural (some of the old structures - managerial levels, focus on large institutes as opposed to community care etc. - are out-dated and people are resistant to change) 

Now, as far as I see it, none of these issues are going to be resolved by privatisation: they are all problems that need a solution that is completely independent of whether the NHS is private or public. So I don't see how you can argue that privatising the NHS is 'smart'. To me, privatising the NHS now is a massive gamble and one I see no reason for making: the NHS works; it's about making it work better. There are examples to be learned from Sweden and Germany (e.g. the much larger focus on community care), but privatisation isn't one of them.

To be employable, you should have skills in Java, C and/or C++, C#, Objective-C, Python, maybe PHP and JS. If you feel like it, a little ASM.

Then you can programme virtually everything. The point is not to be good at one language but to be able to use the language as a tool.

Learn one language properly. The one you have the most fun with. I'd suggest Java because it's pretty big in general and it gives you experience in terms of object oriented programming and keeping some sort of state alive without fucking around with the SESSION array in PHP which is more of a plaster than a solution.

Then take a second one. Maybe C for low level, maybe JS for web stuff.

Once you've done that, you can easily pick up another language.

You generally don't become a Java developer or a PHP developer or whatever. You become a front end developer, a back end developer, a UX designer (user experience), a web developer (still front end but web works a bit differently than other applications) or a mobile designer (keywords here: optimisation, mobile internet (don't let the application download 20 MB of not so important data without a wifi connection), different screen sizes).

It's a 12 week programme ending in a job where someone is aware there may be challenges and is prepared to help. I think it would have been very suitable for him.

Now my client wasn't capable of doing most normal work, he was very confused. But he was very keen to start work again. And he'd be fine in a job as long as someone was aware of his condition and willing to keep a close eye on him.

To get on the 12 week programme a client needs a mental health prescription or health package.

Now I think my client was scared to get a mental health diagnosis because once diagnosed it's on his record. Once branded as a ""loony"" he might become unemployable. So he didn't follow up, and that's my guess of why not.

It's not an unreasonable fear. We know the government wishes to remove the privacy of medical records for people on benefits, we know there's massive reluctance to hire a mentally ill person in the general labour market.

It's a systemic problem, as long as we are scaring the people we'd like to help by threatening stigmatisation and sanctions people won't access help that they need.",null,0,null,1423923938,null,0,false,0,col8y69,null,t3_2vv1dj,null,t1_col8y69,null,t3_2vv1dj,null,null,null,1424583492,null,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9,null

Don't bring up oil rich states as examples, they don't count.

I am not an economist, but to me the equation (high growth = high living standards) seems a bit simplistic. Furthermore, what are 'high living standards'? I'll present two purely speculative societies: 

1. Everyone has equal access to education, healthcare, housing and employment. The minimum income guarantees everyone with a small flat and enough money for transportation, the pursuit of their hobbies/goals and leisre. The maximum income guarantees little above this - certainly not enough for, say, more than two homes and two cars. 

2. 30% of society have access to the most modern exploits of civilisation, technology, entertainment, housing, education etc.. 50% have access to some and need to prioritise. 20% have access to few, if any. 

Now which of these societies has 'higher living standards'? Some people may judge the success of a society based on its most successful individuals. Other people may judge it based on some median or mean. I judge the success of a society based on the success of its least successful citizen. If the least successful citizen of Society #1 is better off than the least successful citizen in Society #2, then Society #1 is the one with the higher living standards. 

Which is why your equation does not make sense to me.

&gt; Yeah i'm all for the red tape cutting corruption and tax avoidance, less for it wasting time for and dragging back businesses. Which you can guarantee Ed will do, energy price freeze's anyone, YEAH! lets freeze it at THE TOP OF THE MARKET!!!!

I don't think anyone wants to 'waste time' or 'drag back business' - this is fearmongering, pure and simple. And yes, if scaling back the 'top of the market' is necessary to boost the 'bottom of the market', then I think red tape is fair - I do believe there is a great imbalance at the moment, with too many virtual monopolies paying too little tax, which hinders the local economy and needs correcting, far more than immigration or the NHS.

&gt; You talk about wanting an egalitarian society, yet don't care about achieving low unemployment? Also don't most people like their 0 hour contracts with only a few wanting more hours, and aren't many of them actually full time? Isn't a society with a high number of 0 hour contracts better than a society with a huge number of unemployed? https://fullfact.org/article/zero_hour_contracts-38391

I do care about achieving low unemployment. I think a better way is to achieve it via more efficient wealth distribution, a living wage and a reduction of the working week. This would allow higher employment in more economically progressive industries (as opposed to putting everyone into telesales and the like) and, most importantly, a higher life satisfaction stemming from a better work-life balance. 

To give you simple anecdotal evidence - I would much rather work half of what I do now, earn half of my salary and I think there certainly are other people on this planet who could do my job to the same standard I do. So why shouldn't this happen? 

Now, there are some inherent problems with zero-hour contracts. Job insecurity is the obvious one, but this has consequences. I have acquaintances who have been refused housing or mortgages based on the fact that they could not guarantee their long-term job security. 

They also allow companies to hire people without paying them a full wage - the website you yourself linked to states that the average working week is 24 hours for a zero-hour contract (remember, these are frequently minimum wage) versus 37 for the rest of us. In a situation where you are happy to have a job, of course you're going to say you're happy with it. 

As for 'few wanting more hours', this is untrue. Your website states that 35% of all workers wanted more hours compared to 12% of non-zero-hour workers. Now, consider the fact that [25% of all zero-hour contracts are full-time students](http://www.theworkfoundation.com/Research/Socio-Economic/Zero-hours-contracts/Key-facts-about-zero-hours-contracts) (who are unlikely to be the group that wants more hours), and this number rises to a half. This doesn't sound like a happy bunch of people to me. 

So no, to re-iterate, I don't think I would like to live in a society with zero-hour contracts. I would much rather live in one where people are guaranteed productive work, so they can focus on their own happiness. The employment numbers would be similar, but the results vastly different. 

---

&gt; Except its not short term debt, and the pain of paying it back in the long run will almost undoubtedly be more costly. Nothing wrong with running up debt to invest, lots wrong with running up debt to simply function which is what we are doing now. So when do we finally say, enough debt is enough? When were growing 10% a year, or when the credit markets cost us so much to borrow we go full Greece and the pound collapses. You will see your fabled equality then.

Exactly. Which is why, say, the Greens want to increase public debt to allow large-scale investment in public projects (leading to better infrastructure, more work and thus more money for the economy), rather than maintaining the currently inefficient status quo (which both Labour and the Conservatives pretty much argue for).

I don't know if they can/ will but you might see if your workplace can get a hand wash with no harsh anionic surfactants - a nurse I know of in the US did - at least not the smaller molecule sulphates (ALS, SLS) and olefin sulfonates. These penetrate the skin barrier and cause disruption, there is even damning research on aqueous cream (1% SLS).

Also look at what you expose your hands to at home - hand wash, body wash, shampoo, dish detergent. Even bubbles can affect xerotic or eczematous skin, every exposure counts. Consider switching to a product based on a surfactant like cocoamidoropyl betaine. Yes this is an effective cleansing agent if you are concerned about removing bacteria and other gunk after work.

You might try Flexitol hand balm: 10% urea (proven efficacy in dry and eczematous skin) and lanolin (supplies cholesterol and cholesterol esters). If that is not enough you will need something heavy/ greasy each night at least. Maybe purchase some cotton gloves to wear over. 

One option is a higher percentage of urea, which may well mean using a foot product. Other useful ingredients include ceramides/ phytosphingosine, lactic acid or niacinamide (both boost skin's own ceramide synthesis), aloe vera or glucosamine (both boost glycosaminoglycan synthesis).

&gt;Doesn't bother me. It has always seemed rather silly to me, this self-serving perpetual quest for never-ending growth. I'd rather live in a more egalitarian society than a fast-growing one.


Well if you are not after a growth in economic activity you must be for huge tax rises or huge budget cuts. 

&gt;If it cuts corruption, prevents tax avoidance etc. it doesn't bother me at all. 

What about if it creates inflexible labour markets and huge start up costs for small businesses?


&gt;As opposed to artificially inflated employment figures caused by the overuse of zero-hour contracts?

Part-timers accounted for 25.3% of the workforce in 2007 but 27.0% in 2014. A 1.7% total increase, and Zero hour contracts make up only a small percentage on this 1.7%. So no in short Zero hour contracts are not pulling up the employment figures hugely.

&gt;If short-term debt is needed to create a better society, I'm happy with that

I wish it was short term but, A 1% surplus throughout the 2020s would reduce debt as a share of national income by 27 percentage points"" (IFS 2015). Thats 15 years down the line, and with promotion of economic growth, without it you can bet it would be worse.


&gt;If high taxes led to an exodus of 'talent', Scandinavia would be populated by zombies.

I agree with you here, there are negatives but they are mostly marginal.

Living standards in western capitalist countries are higher than in socialist ones for all income categories.  Was it not Lenin who said ""he who does not work, shall not eat""? (Spoiler Alert- it was). 

And secondly, your first option is deeply flawed. If my hobby is paragliding in South America and I want my small flat in central London, my basic income might need to be £150k a year.  If my hobby is playing video games and my flat is in Hull, my basic income might need to be no more than £12k a year.  And what if I don't want a flat. What if I like the countryside or want a little garden? Must I be punished and forced to live in a grey concrete government-built tower bloc because I don't conform to state expectations?

And fyi, scaling the top of the market down rarely makes the bottom go up.  In fact, making the rich poorer usually only serves to make the poor poorer too.  This was the original goal of postwar Labour, not to raise up the poor, but simply to crush the rich so that everyone is equally miserable.  This is the source of Bevan's famous speech in which he laments that the 'temporary prosperity' of the 1950s has reduced public support for the socialist agenda.  

Indeed the original goal of the council house program was that the majority of the population would one day live in  them, not just the poor.  Of course, 60 years later we are left with the legacy of those ideals, miles of horrific brutalist skyscrapers blighting every major town and city in the country, full of crime, violence and poverty from which few ever escape.  I don't particularly think we should build more. 

The choice is always between greater growth and prosperity, and equality.  In the times of the cavemen, we were all equally poor.  In the Soviet Union and in much of Mao's China, the former bourgeoisie and the former peasantry alike both starved to death beneath he yoke of government oppression.  But, they were 'equal'.  

Look at Venezuela, home to the second highest crime rate in the world, the planet's highest inflation, and mass poverty and violence, if you want to see where the drive towards 'equality' end up.  It is no coincidence that anyone with money or skills is fleeing the country if they can, and that the government is authorising the use of lethal force to crack down against protesters who stand against them.

As country we need to decide what areas we are competitive in and low wages should not be one of them. Firstly because we will never win this competition, there are European countries with half our minimum wage that have stagnating growth, educated labour and are not competitive and countries in other parts of the world with a tenth of the wage costs we have. We need to have an economy which competes on the quality of its workforce and ease of doing business, something that Northern European countries have been successful in doing.  

Secondly companies will pay the lowest they can get away with to replaceable labour, if the labour can be automated away at a price that is cheaper than wages it will. We have to accept that this is going to happen and plan our economy around it to stay ahead of the curve, not just keep offering lower wages to stave of automation or keep unproductive business solvent. A higher minimum wage will force companies to increase their productivity and put more money in the pockets of the 20% of people of the lowest paid and will circulate in the economy better than any other demographic (i.e they spend it straight away) which means business and the economy benefits. 

What we really need is a much better adult skills retraining programme so those people that are inevitably laid of from automation or non productive business can quickly retrain into new skilled areas which are more productive and less likely to be automated.

null,false,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,null,"I see where you are coming from but, again, I fail to see how even this style of privatisation would help the NHS. It would change who controls bits of the organisation, but it doesn't change the organisation itself. 

Furthermore, is the German system significantly better than the UK one? Or the Australian one? As I said, with Australia and France, I have no experience, so please correct me if I'm wrong - I'm genuinely running only on assumptions with regards to those two. 

The NHS may be 'owned' by the government, but hospitals etc. are also run by individual trusts, allowing for local governance as opposed to the centralised system people perceive it to be. And whilst you are indeed employed by the government, your contract negotiations, applications etc. are all with the trust and it is a competition-based system. In fact, it is a very similar system to the Swedish one, however, the level of de-centralisation in Sweden is even greater. 

So, as I said above, I fail to see how simply changing the ownership of inherently ineffective structures will help anything, apart from (best case scenario, in my opinion) a slight short-term decrease in cost. 

The one example of NHS privatisation I'm somewhat familiar with the taking over of the NHS wing of Broadmoor prison/hospital. Privatised two years ago, the annual cost to government is, thus far, almost double of what it was back when it was an NHS-run wing, with no improvement in meeting targets (targets are a completely separate debate though). 

My former local GP surgery (statistically one of the top 3 performers in the entire trust) is also set to lose its bid for the practice, as it has been outbid by a competitor, who I fail to see can improve an already over-performing surgery. 

As you have perhaps gathered, I am opposed to any level of privatisation of the healthcare system. I'd even reverse the privatisation of things already privatised (catering, cleaning etc.). But I can see why it is an attractive argument. For reasons described in this post and my above one, I think privatisation is a short-term plaster for a growing tumour and, in its best form, will only preserve and perhaps slightly improve the status quo. 

But if it is to happen, it should be done properly: by privatising the genuinely under-performing and failing segments of the NHS. The way it has been handled so far, is that the most high-performing and most cost-effective elements are being privatised, whilst the government is left with the failures. I see no sense in this whatsoever and the cynic in me thinks the plan is to privatise the good, show how the good is better than the government-owned bad, and then privatise the rest. But I freely admit: I am a massive cynic.

Maintaining the native structure of the proteins, protecting them from glycosylation and loss of function; and making sure that the cells producing that matrix, including stem cells, are protected from endogenous and exogenous antioxidants so that your skin can be healthy for as long as you need it. The ingredient list, which is pretty impressive includes the best actives from Nature and the Laboratory.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased for the synergistic combination of MAP, niacinamide and glucosamine and to compare to the Antioxidant CHAS serum.

**Your opinion:** I ordered this serum at the same time as the AF Vitamin C 15% Serum. Since L-ascorbic acid is unstable whereas magnesium ascorbyl phosphate is stable, I popped the Lets Make Collagen serum in the refrigerator for later use. I subsequently had cause to check the expiry date and was pleased to see close to a year from when I ordered. *A year from manufacture is reasonable: all antioxidants degrade over time.*

This serum comes packaged in a light protective brown plastic pump bottle, is white in colour and tends to be sticky which I suspect indicates a fairly high glycerin percentage, perhaps 5%. I used this product on my face, neck, decollete and hands and it lasted a little over a month without skimping on the amount. I did not notice any improvement in my skin over such a short time frame nor any irritation or adverse reaction.

Not a luxurious or exciting product to use, but a functional one with a solid ingredients list. I have other vitamin C products to test but may well repurchase  in the future.

On the whole, the transfer committee are good at identifying players - I think it's in negotiation and 'transfer management' (having contingencies in place if a deal falls through, moving quickly for targets) where we're lacking.

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased for the synergistic combination of MAP and niacinamide, and to compare to the Let's Make Collagen serum.

**Your opinion:** I ordered this serum at the same time as the AF Vitamin C 15% Serum. Since L-ascorbic acid is unstable whereas magnesium ascorbyl phosphate is stable, I popped the Antioxidant CHAS serum in the refrigerator for later use. Perhaps six weeks later I cracked it open.

I only used the serum for a brief period before realising I had been putting an expired product on my face! The product was dated just five weeks from when I ordered, or about four weeks from when I received it. Given this was the second problem with my first order I was extremely disappointed, even more so when I learned that another SCA UK regular had also received very short dated products. We have both received full refunds from Active Formulas.

This serum is brown in colour which is quite offputting - can't say if this is due to the ingredients (tetrahydrocurcuminoids?) or because it was expired. It is not sticky like the Lets Make Collagen serum. I also felt it may be slightly irritating but again this might be due to the product being expired.

Overall I did not enjoy using this product and I will definitely will not repurchase.

Its not about competing on low wages, merely looking at other ways to better quality of life for the low paid, alongside a responsible MW.  Negative incomes taxes are an example. Employment is crucial for retaining skills. If the UK had a higher MW or stricter employment laws, unemployment would have skyrocketed like it did in Europe after the recession. Resulting in a huge loss of human capital, and making it extremely hard for people to get back to work, making those retraining programmes possibly quite wishful thinking. Is there enough resources to retrain 5% of the population? I guess over this decade we will see the outcome of this in europe.

I'm generally of the view that the economy will adjust naturally, a rise in services or other industries will occur on its own, and account for the slowdown in industry employment like it did throughout the last few centuries. Possibly combining that with a 4 day work week.

But it might also help to bring up the average wage if companies aren't able to make lowball offers to people with bad wage negotiation skills. It's a divide and conquer approach that allows companies to get away with paying people less.

I recently found out one of my peers was earning significantly less than she was worth - about £10K less than other people in the same position. If wages were transparent, then there would not be a problem.

Many public service and academic jobs have fixed wage brackets. So it's not unusual to know exactly what someone else is earning.

**Price of product:** £8 for 30ml (offer)

**Where did you purchase:** Active Formulas website

**Product claims:** *""Our new Vitamin C serum is Pre-mixed and the perfect alternative for customers looking for a 'ready to use' C Serum.*

*Vitamin C will help restore elasticity to aging skin, promote collagen synthesis, protect against UV Damage, reduce redness, promote wound healing, suppress melanin synthesis, and more. Visually the use of L-Ascorbic Acid improves wrinkles, and decreases inflammation.*

*This product will keep for 8 months unrefrigerated longer if refrigerated, this slows the oxidation of L-Ascorbic Acid and extends the lifespan of the serum.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased due to the solid ingredients list which considers key research on using vitamin E, ferulic acid and phloretin for a more stable and more effective L-ascorbic acid serum.

[Ferulic acid stabilizes a solution of vitamins C and E &amp; doubles its photoprotection of skin, 2005]
(http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v125/n4/full/5603565a.html)

[Protective effects of a topical antioxidant mixture containing vitamin C, ferulic acid &amp; phloretin against ultraviolet-induced photodamage in human skin, 2008]
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19146606)

**Your opinion:** Knowing that L-ascorbic acid is highly unstable even in a properly formulated product I refrigerated this product from receipt. However upon opening after just a few days I was dismayed to find the serum was a pale straw colour suggesting L-AA had already begun oxidising.

I contacted Active Formulas and they were quick to replace the product with the more expensive [Vitamin C Serum Kit,] (http://www.activeformulas.com/products/vitamin-c-serum-kit) which is simply an 'add A to B' product. However I was extremely disappointed to subsequently discover another short dated product in the same order, and that another SCA UK regular had also received very short dated products from the same company.

I continued to use the original serum for a couple of weeks before the yellow got stronger and I discarded the product. The replacement had no such issues and I used it on my face, neck, decollete and hands for a couple of months, refrigerated throughout.

As expected my sensitive skin could not tolerate such a strong acid daily so I applied it every other day on average, and did not use other acids on my face. The serum is somewhat sticky when it dries (due to the L-AA itself which is hygroscopic) but it did not leave my skin overly tight during the wait period needed for penetration. When I moved onto a gentler MAP serum I found I missed the 'glow' that an acid serum confers (probably exfoliation and mild irritation!).

I have misgivings about the claim that any water based L-ascorbic acid serum could last eight months without oxidising, especially a premixed product. Other sources recommend a maximum of three months, and note that any yellowing indicates 'advanced oxidation'.

Overall not a luxurious or exciting product to use, but a functional one with a solid ingredients list. I am open minded to repurchasing but would first like to try the SR Skincare [10% CE ferulic serum,]
(http://www.sr-skincare.co.uk/30ml-10-vitamin-c-serum-25-p.asp) because the lower percentage may be better suited to daily use on my sensitive skin.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, L-ascorbic acid (15%), glycerin, hyaluronic acid, ferulic acid, phloretin, pomegranate seed oil, tocotrienols, vitamin E, astaxanthin, lycopene, lutein, alpha lipoic acid, beta carotene, xanthan gum, lemon extract, orange extract, citrus essential oils, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, sorbic acid.""*

I think it's safe to say a good 21 year old could break into that group of forwards as a 4th choice. Jovetic doesn't look like he's staying past June, so we could even see him next year if he's as good as people say. 

Pozo I'm not sure on, he is very highly rated but he's not a striker so it's not fair to judge on the games we saw him in where he was ok but a bit underwhelming. 

Lopes, IMO will almost certainly be in the squad next season. I think he'll replace Lampard making some sun appearances and cup games. If he's good enough obviously he'll play more. 

Rekik or Denayer will probably replace Demichelis and Boyata in 15/16 I reckon, when they'll be 21 and Demi will be 36. 

So really all being reasonably well we could have 3rd and 4th choice CBs, 4th choice striker and a couple of rotation attacking midfielders all from the academy in 2 years time. 

I doubt they will all succeed. Maybe 2 or 3. Maybe just 1 - but the youth policy will take shape, it's just a painfully slow process when you're starting from 0 academy players playing regularly.

BBC - Basically independent, but politicians can fuck with their budget. A lot of ways very good, but can end up simply reflecting the establishment point of view.

null,false,chadwini,null,null,null,"Jay Rodriguez signed for Southampton for around £7m in the summer of 2012, for our first season back in the Premier League. Rodriguez made his professional debut for his home-town club Burnley in 2007 at the age of 18, though his real breakthrough season was 2008/09 when he played 35 games (5 goals) in total, as Burnley were promoted to the Premier League. However, an ankle injury kept him out of the majority of the next season and to in order to get game time he returned to the Championship with Barnsley. He managed to overcome that disappointment the next season as he became Burnley’s top scorer with 15 goals, and then scored 21 the season after which earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Year, and a move to Southampton.
  
Rodriguez experienced a slow goal-scoring start to his Southampton career, with only 1 league goal by Christmas. However his form, along with the rest of the team, improved with the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino in January. He picked his goals too; scoring at Manchester United in defeat and in impressive wins at St Mary’s against Liverpool and Chelsea (memorably mugging John Terry off in the process). 
  
Rodriguez’s progression continued into the 2013/14 season where he scored 17 goals for Southampton (including an absolute beauty at Fulham) and made his England debut. However the season ended in disappointment after an Achilles injury put him out of the World Cup, an injury that could keep him out of the whole of the 2014/15 season after a number of setbacks.
  
Rodriguez has most often been used as an inside left forward at Southampton, although he has played as a single frontman as well as in a front two with Lambert.  He has developed into a lethal finisher, and his improved movement meant he was in goal-scoring positions much more often last season. He’s always had pace, but it will be interesting to see whether this pace will be affected by his Achilles injury.

Agree with your points re:HDI, which is why I didn't mention it. As I said - it depends on one's definitions. The best the HDI can account for is current popular opinion of what constitutes 'living standards'. 

Re:zero-hour contracts, you are right, they are a small part of total jobs, but my gripe with them is because, in my opinion, they are used to inflate our current economic miracle. Since 2012, the number of people in employment on zero-hour contracts has risen from below 1% to 2%. Since 2003, the nature of zero-hour contracts has changed from a range of salaries to them being primarily used for lower-paid jobs. 

So, in other words, there's more of them and the ones that are being created are likely of the 'problematic' kind. Since 2012, the government also reports unemployment dropping by some 0.7%, so I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that most of these new jobs are the 'problematic' zero-hour contracts. 

Of course, you can argue that some shitty jobs are better than no jobs (which is why people are happy to have even these). I just wish greater focus was spent on creating sustainable and stable jobs, even if it is a more lengthy and more painful path. Then again, it is difficult getting elected on a 'more pain for all' ticket...

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea.

**Your opinion:** Packaged in a glass jar but the orange plastic lid just looks cheap. The serum has a citrus scent, a silky non greasy texture and matte finish characteristic of the silicone base (-siloxanes are volatile so evaporate off).

A major draw back is that the percentage of L-ascorbic acid is not given. Sometimes stings when applying a water based product - such as moisturiser - unless employing a wait time which negates the point of an anhydrous (no water) product being gentler or slower release. I also needed two capsules to cover my face, neck and decollete so the jar only lasts two weeks which makes it quite expensive. Perhaps best for use when travelling?

**Price of product:** £10 for set of three deluxe samples

**Where did you purchase:** Latest in Beauty website

**Product claims:** *""An intensely powerful shot of anti-oxidant youth. This Polyphenol + Vitamin C anti-oxidant, anti-wrinkle concentrate blocks free radicals (the main cause of wrinkles), corrects and defends the skin against the aggressions of daily life (UV rays, pollution).*

*Enriched with hyaluronic acid and olive squalane, it also has moisturising and plumping action. Lines and wrinkles are visibly corrected. The skin becomes brighter. Hypoallergenic, non-photosensitising and non-comedogenic formula. Dermatologist tested.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines, mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased on the strength of the name/ active ingredients (polyphenols and Tetra-C) and [Caroline Hirons blog post.] (http://www.carolinehirons.com/2014/04/caudalie-polyphenol-c15.html)

**Your opinion:** In testing this product I decided to give the line the chance to work as it was formulated to: together. I tried to get hold of samples of the Overnight Detox Oil but had a distinctly UNhelpful response from Caudalie when I enquired as to where samples could be purchased in the UK (they are all over US eBay).

I also dropped most of my other skincare products whilst testing so initially I only used Una Brennan Vitamin C+ cleansing oil, the three Caudalie samples, PTR Retinol Fusion PM and CeraVe lotion PM.

By far the most impressive thing about this serum is the packaging. Even tho only a deluxe sample, the bottle is light protective green glass and inside the opening is a plastic ring that removes excess serum from the dropper. Seems to be a perfect miniature of the full size product!

The texture is thick enough to spread without spilling everywhere. The product is fairly hydrating even if not immediately followed with moisturiser, presumably due to the heavy emphasis on humectants (glycerin, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid). I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction.

Although not greasy, this serum does leave a sheen and slight tackiness on the face which is easily covered by subsequent products. Overall the use and performance really reminds me of my Ladykin ampoules (Korean brand serums).

Ingredients wise the key actives are high up the short ingredients list. However glycerin is rarely used above 5% (higher is sticky) so I suspect that the name of the line (C15) is not indicative of the percentage of Tetra-C.

Overall I enjoyed using this product the most of the three Caudalie products mostly due to the packaging, I have finished the bottle but definitely will not repurchase.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, butylene glycol, glycerin, squalane, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate, vitamin E, ceteareth-20, palmitoyl grape seed extract, fragrance, glyceryl stearate SE, potassium sorbate, acrylates/ C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, caprylyl glycol, xanthan gum, hyaluronic acid, carbomer, sodium phytate, sodium hydroxide.""*

This eye cream is very lightweight and non greasy so would be suitable for use under make up but feels unpleasantly 'filmy' when applied to the lips.

Ingredients wise the key actives are way down the ingredients list (vitamin E is often used at 1%) so I suspect Caudalie have only used a minimal percentage of pricey Tetra-C. As such the full size product is overpriced.
